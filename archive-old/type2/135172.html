Subject: Re: [T2] Happy Dance - Battery &amp; Ground Contacts Follow-up -

&quot;You need to disconnect the battery when it's not in use for that long. I
would keep the battery inside the garage and put a charger on it the night
before you want to put it back in your bus.&quot;

 

For long term storage I agree... but I've also had good luck with a battery
tender - it monitors the battery and gives it a trickle charge when it needs
it.  I like to keep the battery in the vehicle so I can start it once in a
while &amp; you never know when you might get a really nice day and you want to
go for a ride.

 

&quot;A couple bucks worth of &quot;Irish Spring&quot; soap left in and around the vehicle
seems to repel the l'il critters..&quot;

 

I've found that a combination of Bounce fabric softener sheets tucked in the
cloth areas and moth balls; in the cabinets, a cup full on the floor and
some more in the engine compartment works really well - no mice so far this
year.
