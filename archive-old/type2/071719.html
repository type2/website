Subject: Re: [T2] idle problem/more info

I agree with Karl.  But for HC to be that High it must be a whale of 
a hole.  It's so lean that it's just bearly firing.

The only other time I've seen HCs this high with low CO was when I 
mis-installed the vacumn lines.  It appeared that the timing was 
correct at idle (very rough) but it really had advanced the engine 
around 30 degrees.

&gt;&gt;  &gt;todays test results were
&gt;&gt;  &gt;HC - 5925ppm  - fail
&gt;&gt;  &gt;CO -0.00  -  pass
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Can anyone explain to me how you can have CLEAN 0.0 CO and high DIRTY
&gt;&gt;  HC?????????
&gt;
&gt;Way TOO lean, so lean it is mis-firing because there is no fuel to burn.
&gt;Look for a massive vacuum leak.
