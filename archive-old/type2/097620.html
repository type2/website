Subject: re: Parts FS:

Hello List,

    I have two complete fuel systems removed from running Type Four bus
engines. They are 2 - barrel Weber's, complete with carburetors, manifolds,
air cleaners (needing filter elements of course), all hardware, etc. They
have both been off the engines a while, so buy with the thought they may
need kits before running. Kits run about $15.00 to $20.00 depending on which
supplier you buy from. Check the trade mags, Hot VW - Trends, etc. for the
parts.
    List price new is around $300.00 each. I'll take $150.00 plus shipping
each. Or $275.00 plus shipping for both.

    I also have a high performance ignition system for sale. It is a
Pointless Capacity Discharge, Crane Cams part number # XR 700 control unit,
installed in a 009 Distributor. The distributor bushing are tight, the
advance plate is free, with full advance. Also it comes with an Accel
Eliminator Ignition, Super Coil, part number # 140001.

    Lastly, I have a Shifter with Aluminum shaft, and &quot;T&quot; handle, with
button, reverse lock-out, short throw. Made by????? I have seen them
advertised as, Scat, Empi, Hurst, etc.????? Your guess is as good as mine.
Truth be know, it is made by the lowest bidder, and the distributor puts
their decal on it and it becomes theirs! Anyway, $25.00 plus shipping.

    If your interested in any of these parts, please contact me off list,
and I'll send pictures. I'm in Southwest Louisiana.

Thanks,

Howard
