&gt; And when you press it, should it go on? like testing it? Mine doesn't go on 
&gt; when I press it.

Some do, some don't.  Depends upon the year.

&gt; BUT
&gt; 
&gt; It went on the other day, and stayed on. But while I'm press the brakes, it 
&gt; goes off.

It indicates an imbalance between the front and rear circuits of your
brake system,  Don't drive until you figure out what is wrong, since you
could be down to 30% of your normal braking power.
