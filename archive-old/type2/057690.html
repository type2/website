Subject: Exhaust popping??

OK, got my '81 engine back in my '73, with new heads, new seals, and
it starts and runs really good. Much better than before, because besides
the new heads (and the engine only had about 10K on it), I found a
cracked rubber elbow on the air regulator (?? -- is that the right name,
it controls the cold start valve -- a bad vacuum leak that I never could
see before) and also figured out that since I don't have the EGR hooked
up (extractor exhaust w/no EGR port) I should disconnect the
EGR/throttle connection, right? Otherwise that's just another vacuum
leak at high speed.
   Anyway, this morning I re-did the valve adjustment, just to make sure
that it was right after the lifters got pumped up. One, the intake on
#3, which I noticed when I put the engine back together made a weird
clicking noise when I turned the engine over by hand, still seems a
little weird. Like it isn't as solid as the rest, but it doesn't make
that rattling noise that lifters sometimes make after the engine has sat
for awhile.
    So, I wouldn't worry about it, except that I've got this constant
exhaust pop whenever I let off the gas. Sounds great otherwise. Could be
a slight exhaust leak, I guess, since I couldn't get the right side top
bolt to tighten all the way -- the support bracket that comes down from
the fan housing on that side seems too short and won't pull in all the
way. I could  get the bolt thru it and get a nut on it, but not really
snug it up. 
    So should I worry about the exhaust pop or not -- I'm about to take
a 1120 mile cruise with this?
   Also, I should mention, my timing light died, so I just set the
timing statically at 0 TDC to be on the safe side. Sure starts nice, and
great throttle response, power, etc. So far the oil temp hasn't gone
over 210 with 95 ambient temp.
    Hey, another thing -- you volks should be proud of me -- I got rear
tin! A bit crude, probably never get a real seal on it, but at least
it's a heat shield between the exhaust and the fan.
