Subject: Re: [T2] Save 70 bug from a good beating. :-)

You could give your mixture a check, when I overjetted my Kadrons I had 
a similar problem under load up a hill, down from 4th to 3rd to 2nd to 
stall. Rejetted, mixture checked and I no longer have this problem. 
Mind you, this also coincided with winter gas being sold everywhere up 
here.

&gt; I am now suspecting it's my 28 PICT carb doing this? I cannot figure 
&gt; out
&gt; anything else that could be the culprit? Would appreciate any help on 
&gt; this,
&gt; I'm getting stumped. Timing, dwell, vacuum advance, and all electrical
&gt; appears fine.
