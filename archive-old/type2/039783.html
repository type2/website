Subject: Hall unit replacement 

Thanks to all the listees for the great advice on replacing the Hall
unit in the distributor of a '79 California bus!

To anyone else who may need to do this, there are two tools that will
make this task _much_ easier: a pair of snap ring pliers to remove the
circlips and a battery cable puller.  The puller is key: it is like a gear
puller, though smaller a cheaper.  You just put the clips around the Hall
shield and the end of the screw on the top of the shaft; turn the screw
and the shield will come right off!  Don't mess around with screwdrivers
trying to pull it off: you will likely bend the shield and scratch stuff
up (been there, done that).

Anyway, the diagnosis was correct: one of the wires was indeed broken. 
I was hoping I could fix this by soldering a new wire in place, but the
whole assembly was old and the other wires were brittle.  Once the whole
thing was apart, I realized that there is no reliable way to attach a new
length of wire to the magnet assembly.  First of all, the wires run from
the connector to the underside of the magnet assembly, which is bolted to
a metal plate.  This makes it hard to get at the wires.  Second, even
after breaking the magnet assembly off the plate, I found there is no
point to solder new wires, they simply run directly inside the plastic
housing.

So, I broke down and shelled out $100 for a new Hall unit!  Zoinks!  This
was a Bosch unit, and it looks like the design has improved a bit.  The
wires seem to be a little beefier, and there is a plastic cover to protect
them.  Reassembly was a snap, though there was a little metal bracket
with a magnet and a screw hole that I wasn't sure about.  I think it is
back in the correct place, though I really don't know what this extra
magnet (with no wire connection) is for.

Anyway, the distributor is back in the bus and I'm now getting a spark
again!  Engine still won't turn over, though :(  Sounds like the starter
is pretty weak, it isn't cranking well.  Guess it is time to overhaul the
starter... but why wasn't it weak before?  Oh well, tomorrow...

Again, thanks to all!
