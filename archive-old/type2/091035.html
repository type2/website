Subject: few questions RE: 70 westy

hey all,

first thing i want to say is hello to everyone.  i
just bought my first vw bus, a 70 westy, last week.  i
joined the list today because this looks to be a great
resource for info.  you'll have to excuse some
ignorance, as i'm not yet mechanically inclined.  i'm
looking forward to learning though!

my first question is what type of oil to use?  the guy
i bought it from said to use non-detergent oil. 
looking through the archives, i realize it is
dangerous to use detergent oil if it is really dirty
due to the use of non detergent oil.  so do i have to
use non detergent from here on out, or can i change
the oil every 300 miles w/ detergent oil to get the
dirty oil out?   or should i just tear it apart and
clean it first?  

second, i've read to shift at 3500 rpm and cruise at
3000 rpm.  how does this translate to speeds?  i shift
into 2nd _at_ 10-15 mph, 3 _at_ 27-30 mph, 4 _at_ 45 mph.  this
ok?  

sorry if this is a FART!  lookin forward to takin my
bus campin soon!

hope everyone is having a great day!
ryan
