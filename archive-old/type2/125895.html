&gt;Yes, I know there is a description in the library but I guess I'm just a guy

&gt;pictures that show the difference between a hydraulic and a solid lifter?

Solid lifters have almost no waist and are well, solid:

The hydraulic lifter will have a more noticeable one along with an oiling hole in the side and a snap ring on one end to keep the piston inside the lifter. There's a picture in Bentley...
