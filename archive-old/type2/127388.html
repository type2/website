Subject: decoding microfiche: VW pn's

I need the size of the washer &amp; nut that hold the thermostat onto a
type4 motor. I didn't bring my Bentley, Idiot's or the motor with me to
work, but I'd like to hit the hardware store and get the bits. I
figured I could figure it out from the microfiche (thanks to Mr.
Atwell's site) and the VW numbering guide in the library. I figure the
PN should start with 211-119 but I get stuck on the last 3 numbers. The
example in the library describes the flywheel's last 3 numbers as 271.
From looking at the microfiche, I can see no correlation between the
271 and the 18 on the fiche. The archives were sparce in this area. 
First, could someone tell me the proper nut for attaching the
thermostat to the case? Second, how do the numbers on the fiche
correlate to the numbers on the part? I must have misread the Library
article, or maybe the long weekend addled my brain. Regardless, this is
one of those &quot;teach a man to fish&quot; kinda things.
Thanks!

btw, I installed those cool air flaps, and the custom thermostat from
ACN over the weekend. Can't wait to give it a good test... need to
&quot;nut&quot; it on first :)
