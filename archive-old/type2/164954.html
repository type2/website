Subject: Re: [T2] Bilbusses? Busboards?

There are billboards up and down I5 in Oregon for the Newport Aquarium that have a Baywindow on them, it is a drawing, not a photo, I looked on the website to see if there was anything there but no luck.

I notice people checking mine out more and more all the time, it seems to have suddenly became hip, of course the newest bay is almost 30, that is usually a big turning point for a cars life cycle, at 25 the kids get into them, at 30 they became accepted by most of society.
