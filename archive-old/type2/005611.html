&gt; Just one question for you about your tow hitch.  What size engine do you
&gt; have in your 69?  I have a 1600 DP, will it have enough power to tow a
&gt; couple of thousand pounds?  Just currious.

I have a 1600 single port, very stock.  The owners manual states 1100 pounds
as the limit for a trailer without brakes.  That's about what I plan to
pull.  Enough power is a relative question.  It'll just be really slow.
I've been agonizing about doing this with my bus for a while, so I'll post
to the list what it feels like once I do it.  I do know that busses seem to
be happier when fully loaded.  Hmm.....
