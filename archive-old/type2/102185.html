Robb,

I put the bigger alternator (AL108) in my '79 bus. I didn't modify it for
more output, so I am guessing that is what was expensive for your
installation?

What did you do for the cooling boot? I made one from part of a rubber home
plumbing trap. It fits/works fine. Not ideal, mind you, but workable.
