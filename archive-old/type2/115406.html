Subject: Re: [T2] looking for T2-microfiches

QUOTE:
&gt;Several years ago, the VW dealership parts manager loaned me his person 
&gt;copy (which I promptly disassembled and copied) of the T2 dealer parts 
&gt;books for the model years 1968 thru 1972. I have found it a great resource 
&gt;and would not own a bus without a copy.
&gt;
&gt;A friend of mine purchased at a swap meet a four volume (A4 paper in four 
&gt;ring euro-binder) VW shop publication dealing with body work and repairs 
&gt;for T1 and T2 Transporters. I has descriptions, line drawing and photos. I 
&gt;need to make some high quality copies.

Perhaps you could get the Type2 website to post copies of these for all to 
see?  They would probably have to have the VW symbol removed though...
