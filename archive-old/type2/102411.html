Subject: Publicity!

I was working at Patti's yesterday and got a call from a gal in the Los Angeles 
office of the Washington Post. She's researching an article on bus culture!
  I chatted with her a bit and invited her to meet at the O.C.T.O. show this 
Sunday in Huntington Beach. I gave her my cell phone number -- we'll see if 
she calls. What fun!

Nikki
