Dear Jeffrey.

I have a available for sale or trade, a Javelin radio of the appropriate 
size, for the early dashboard, DIN radio aperture, of your 1970 VW 1600 Type 
2 Westfalia Continental.

It is a Javelin mono radio, with VHF, Long, Medium &amp; SHORT wave bands and 
comes complete with the fiting kit and all the original literature.

It was originally fitted to my 1973 VW 1600 Type 2 Westfalia Continental, 
until I discovered a modern stereo system, with four speakers.

If you are interested, let me know.

Regards.
        Nigel A. Skeet

1973 VW '1600' Type 2 Westfalia Continental, with pop-top gas springs, 
pantograph rear-window wiper, 1911cc VW Type 2 &amp; 4 hybrid engine, nine 
supplementary gauges and much, much more!
