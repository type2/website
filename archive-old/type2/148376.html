Subject: Re: [T2] CHT gauge- was Tach-&gt; Red-Line/Idle/Wiring

&lt;I'm curious, why do most listees rag so badly on the
VDO gauges?&gt;

Because (in the case of the Head Temp) as I understand it the head temp could read +/- the outside temps. Your engine could be overheating but because the outside temps (cab temps) are so low, it would no show up on the dash. Needs ambient temp compensation added as I understand. ANYONE please correct me. I'd love to better understand the issue at hand. I argue for any info is good info but with this flaw the info isn't even consistent. Bad, bad, bad.

My own experience with VDO was an oil pressure gauge that read very, very low at idle - below the point where the idiot light would come on. Verified with a mechanical gauge the VDO was just wrong. That said I'm going to keep the VDO gauges and try to make them work when I'm back on the road.
