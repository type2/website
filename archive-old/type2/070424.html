Finally got my engine back in. Well, it's really another engine, but it's
in the bus. In keeping with my tradition of engines for under $150, I
picked this one up for $100, tore it down enough to check things out,
slapped on some pistons and rings from another motor, put the good heads
on (the problem that forced engine removal in the first place) and got her
in the bus. I used the carb off of the $100 engine, as mine didn't operate
properly (it leaks). If I didn't have three kids and a wife that worked
evenings, all this could have been done on a weekend...or a series of
evenings. As my life goes, it took about three weeks--(I'll get your tools
back soon, Chris. Really! Thanks!)

PROBLEM:  I now have started the engine, but I notice that once it warms
up, I can't hold the accelerator in one position and maintain consistent
RPMs. When it's cool, it will maintain basic consistency, though I can
hear a slight variation. I'm thinking it's either carb problems or the
wrong size ?pushrod? for the fuel pump. I checked my stash of these and
found three different sizes? I picked the one that looked like it would
open the diaphram without going ballistic.

I'm thinking I'll put the old carb back on long enough to see if the
consistency/lack thereof problem goes away. Fire extinguisher ready
(though it only leaks a tiny bit way up toward the front *FIF* of the
carb).

I didn't want to rebuild the new (to me) carb because I've never had any
luck rebuilding these 34PICT3's. ...but if I find it's the carb, rebuild
looks like my next best option.

What would you do?

Thanks! Joe
