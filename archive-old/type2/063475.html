Subject: Re: CD Player in Buses

&gt;I want to put an new stereo with a CD player in my '77. I talked to 
&gt;some guy at the local &quot;we sell you big huge stereos&quot; store and he said 
&gt;I might eventually have problems with as it ages due to the angle it 
&gt;will sit in the dash. Most cars the stereo goes in level, in the buss 
&gt;it will sit at a downward angle.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone had trouble with there CD players? 
&gt;
&gt;If its just going to wear out faster I won't spend as much money on it.

Patrick,

I can't imagine how the angle of the CD player would make any difference 
for it's longevity, but I'd give Crutchfield a call and ask them. They 
are a mail order car stereo company, and they give great technical advice 
over the phone. Prices are good, selection is great.

Cheers,

Bren
