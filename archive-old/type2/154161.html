Subject: Dorper Top - won't stay up

I built a frame in my basement to hold up my Dorper top. The part of the top 
that screws onto the roof is screwed to the frame. I made new hinges to hold 
up the top. They consist of two pieces of wood - maybe 6 1/2 X 5 - they are 
joined in the middle with spring loaded hinges. It attaches to the pop-up 
part of the roof with hinges and to the piece that screws onto the roof with 
hinges. The pieces themselves look awesome - but the %$&amp;*#_at_)^ won't stay up.

I have it all together and it collapses.  Does anyone have a Dorper top on a 
bus? If so ... is there anything besides the wooden hinges that holds the 
roof up?
