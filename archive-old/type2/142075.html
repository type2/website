Subject: Subject: Bus accident

You're getting good advice so far.  If they scrap the bus, they may place it 
with an auction service, where junkies will bid on it... at least that is the 
case with newer (more valuable) vehicles.  Old stuff may be disposed of 
through different channels, depending on ins. co and geography.

If you choose to keep it, you should ask the insurance guy if they will give 
you a fixed salvage quote, or if you need to go bid against the junkyard 
types.  If you are gutsy, you may find that you can buy the remains back at 
auction at a very low price.... BTW this will consume your time, some towing 
charges, etc.  Are you sure you didn't suffer any neck/back injuries for which 
your lawyer sent you to an orthopaedic consultant ;-))
