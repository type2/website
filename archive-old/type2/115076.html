&gt; For anyone looking for thermostats for the Type-4. Looks like BusDepot has
&gt; them back in stock. Someone just recently was looking for one if memory serves
&gt; me right. $49.95

I wish I bought one earlier when they were only $15:

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/095636.html

The VW dealer price is currently $68.
The best price NEW I've found is Pelican Parts at $45.
The price USED at Auto Atlanta is $6.

The aircooled_dot_net article says the Type I unit opens at 80-85. I discovered
that the Type 4 thermostat opens at 85-90C which explains why John says
you'll have more heat if you do the mod.
