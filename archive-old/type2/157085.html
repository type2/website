Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Westy now runs

Hello List's, I finally got my 78 Westy to run. Most
of the replies was about checking for wires or a fuel
problem. After going through everything again, the
fuel pump stopped running. So I hooked up the fuel
pump directly to 12v. The fuel pump then worked, so I
started the bus and it ran. I figured the fuel pump
wasn't getting a signal to kick in.


     Ok this is what I finally found. On the fuel pump
relay, the plug connector with the multi-colored
wires, there was one wire that came loose from the
connector. What probably happened was it came loose
but made some contact in the biggining, but as I was
unplugging it to check the relay it came even more
loose, and lost all contact with the terminal. Once I
found this wire and got it back in all the way in the
connector it started right up and ran.

    So Thank's everyone,

&gt; Hello list's, I have been fighting this for 2 days.
&gt; I
&gt; now need help. This is a 78 Westy, 2000cc FI. It was
&gt; running fine with no problems other than a weak
&gt; pressure plate.
