'I have pretty much the same feelings about my '71 with stock 1600DP, BUT:

Having just droven down US395 over four 7-8000 foot passes with a load of
three bedroom dressers (drawers full), twentysome large paintings, two end
tables, a large wrought iron sculpture, wife, and two daughters, I
suspect that the trip would have been a bit more fun with about 100 more
horsepower.  35MPH on the uphills just isn't pleasant, especially when
getting worse mileage than vehicles with twice as much power.  Even
unloaded, the uphills slow the bus too much.'


George; 

I had a really nice 71, stock 1600 dp. I sold it after my second road
trip, and the lack of oomph was a big big factor. I'd previously driven a
79 FI. 

I'm now back driving a dual carb 1.8 74. It blows the upright away,
entirely. IMHO there is no comparison between the two motors. My 71 had as
strong a stock engine as you can expect from an upright, and it behaved
just as you describe. An absolute dog. Fully loaded, my 74 can pull 65 mph
up a long, steep hill without even needing full throttle. It cruises at 70
with ease. Sure, that upright is easy to remove and work on, but the
thought of driving up 395 getting pushed by an upright makes me want to
curl up and die. 

I couldn't be happier with my switch to the T-IV. Much better than
expected.
