Subject: : [T2] Cylinder rebuild questions (long)

Subject: [T2] Cylinder rebuild questions (long)
&gt; I have some questions regarding rebuilding the top end of my 82 Vanagon
&gt; 2.0L air cooled engine

I counted 25 questions.

&gt; The van dropped an intake valve seat on #1 cylinder when I was doing
&gt; compression testing in the driveway. Very lucky. The van/engine has only
&gt; 51K miles on the original engine.

Unlilely, this engine is worn out. Start with the Bentley procedure for
rebuild.
What was the Compression? Oil pressure? Consumption? Service history? By
Whom?
Oil change interval? piston ring gap? ring land clearance? thrust bearing
endplay?
valve guide clearance? Engine bolt torque spec? etc., etc.........

&gt; My questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Is it common for the VW heads to drop seats this easily?

Valve seats don't usually drop during a compression test.
(You were just lucky 8^). Bet you had a reason to do that test, though.....

&gt;I was hoping to just replace the one head as the compression is fine on the
other.

Chamber volumes must match. ( Compression ratio). Deck height must match
too.

&gt; 2. Is it OK just to replace the one head?

Which one? They are both in need of a rebuild! And what about those main
bearings ?
Have you read any good books lately?
