Subject: RE: [T2] New items and interest (jailbar partnr)

&gt; Thanks to all that replied, it appears that I
&gt; recieved new pre 68 jailbar
&gt; sets and vanagon sets. Dam, now if they can get it
&gt; right and get me the bay window ones!!

I now looked at the T2 fiche as well and discovered
the part number for part:

  &quot;241 853 445&quot;

is the same on T1's as on T2's! So the part actually
didn't change when the Baywindow was introduced.

The rest could be different though.._dot_depends on the
partnrs and a possible difference in the length of the
bars.

You can P-mail me if you like to have a picture of
this microfiche as well.


yours,


Vincent
