&gt; Jeff is asking about the feasibility of (in effect) adding pictures to our
&gt; emails by adding links to the pictures (NOT by sending binaries or encoded
&gt; attachments to the emails which will get the message killed).
&gt; 
&gt; I could be overruled on this by either list owner but I think this is an
&gt; extremely sensible idea in those cases where pictures are worth a thousand
&gt; words. Listees reading from a browser or a savvy mail client can click back
&gt; and forth between the pic/page and the email, while those with simpler
&gt; browsers have relatively little HTML clutter to ignore. Remember that the
&gt; only thing worse than ASCII art is ASCII art without line endings,
&gt; witnesseth events of late. 8)

I think this is a &quot;Good Idea&quot; (tm) and have always been one to go off and
explore picture links that are included with posts!  By all means, if you
have space and want to put pix on your page and send people there via an
embedded link, goforit! As Ken says, tho, the limits are that there are
filters for binaries and for HTML markup. 

If you read the list from the office over a T1 line on the latest
&quot;operating system with browser-like features&quot; (MS' latest take on why they
are *not* a monopoly and *not* trying to drive Netscape from the face of
the earth :) then this limit may not make sense, but if, like your list
admin, you read it over a UNIX dial-up using pine, then it makes *lots* of
sense :-)  and we try to cater to anyone who can figure out the sign-on
procedure.  Maybe in a year or two, but not now.
