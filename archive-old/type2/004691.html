Great month up here in the great white north
first I lay my hands on a driveaway tent in primo condition for way more
than a far price and the lady holds it for me cause I promised I'd be there.
Now it looks like I'm to be the new owner of a 77 Riviera. This bus has
apparently been converted to a single carb, can anyone suggest a better dual
carb set up. Can the solex'es off the 1700-1800 work on a 2 liter?
Can Kadrons be mounted on proper manifolds.
More good news, the 72 westy I picked up on the cheap with presumed bad
engine, just passed it's compression test. Looks like a carb rebuild and
tune-up and on the road it goes.
Chuck
