Subject: propane safety

     I have a Coleman propane stove.  I bought the small Coleman bottles for
this first trip.  Eventually I will buy a large, refillable propane bottle.
Since the bottles are not to be exposed to temps higher then 120F, where do
you store them?  Both for driving &amp; while in camp?  If I do get a large
bottle, the same question.  Where do you have the large bottle when you are
cooking?  I looked in the archive but did not really get my question
answered.  Most questions were about built in propane appliances.  Any
propane suggestions will be appreciated.

     BTW  Thanks for all the input on the bike rack &amp; tarp question from
yesterday.  I got a Hollywood 3 bike rack this morning for $49.  Will mount
on my rear drip rail &amp; bumper &amp; allow me to open the engine lid.
