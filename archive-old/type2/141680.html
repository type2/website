Subject: friday Ghia question

Despite my severe lack of funds, I found myself writing a check to a guy for a 69 Ghia that was sitting in the parking lot of my school for the past two years.  It's actually not a bad car, once I get the water out of the gas tank.

So, despite my superior Volkswagen Owner's intellect, it pains me to say that I can't figure out how to get the trunk and the hood open.  The hood, fortunately was opened by the PO and doesn't shut very easily, if at all, so I have just left it unlatched.  In the future though, I would like to know how to do that.  

Anyone with information on the mystery of the Ghia trunk and hood latch, please p-mail me.

As for my bus, it's doing fine now that I've washed the egg off of it.  Thank you all for your support in my time of need.
