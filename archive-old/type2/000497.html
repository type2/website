Subject: [T2] New Westy Won't start


&gt;This morning my newly acquired '77 Westy started right up, no problem.
Couple
&gt;of hours later, after I had moved my Bug out of the garage, I went to move
&gt;the Westy. It started, I drove about 15 feet, it died. Since then it will
&gt;turn over, start sometimes and run for 3-4 seconds, then die. Occasionally
it
&gt;gives a muffled backfire. My old '76 had a carb, and this one is fuel
&gt;injected (as the '76 should have been). What to check first? One other
thing,
&gt;the passenger side door is pretty eaten up with rust, but that didn't
bother
&gt;me too much because I have a good passenger door off a '76- jokes on me, VW
&gt;changed the hinges from 76 to 77! Anyone want to trade a '77 pass. side
door
&gt;for one from a '76?   Thanks, Jeff S.
