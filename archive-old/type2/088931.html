Subject: Re: [T2] washer valve

[...]

As far as I know, it is part of the wiper switch and is non-replaceable by
itself.


&gt;       Does anybody know the part number for the washer valve on my 77 bus?
&gt; Does anyone know where I can find one?  I am talking about the valve screwed
&gt; to the turn signal switch.  Mine is all cracked &amp; leaking.  Thanks.
