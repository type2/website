Subject: RE: fuel filler

I replaced my fuel filler hose on my '79 about a year ago, and I actually
got the hose from NAPA, they actually carried that size hose in stock and it
was made for fuel. Good Luck

Brad





Dave-
         If you can put accurate dimensions on a note to the list, I'll take
it to a local shop
that makes custom hosing (brake, fuel, hydraulic, etc.), for cars, trucks,
and earth-
moving equipment.
         In the meantime, have you tried to match it with something in the
Metro Molded
Rubber catalog?
