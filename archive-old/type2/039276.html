&gt;&gt; stick with 15.5!

&gt;Hmmmm. Not to add any more confusion, but I just
&gt;checked my '69s owner's manual....it says 15.9 US
&gt;gallons!!! ;-)

This is why you need the owner's manual for your chassis year and model.
There is much data in there that is not repeated in Bentley. Essential data
specified for your puppy. The workshop manual is a supplement to the
owner's manual or vice versa. Having both is the best money that any
do-it-yourselfer can spend if he/she wants to pinch the most pennys in
reality. 

With regard to the tank capacity, if you drain it for any reason, hoses,
repair, relpace the screen, ect., when your done, put in two measured
gallons, drive to the pump, top it off, add the ACTUAL gallons of YOUR
tank, for any car, even if it's dented like my other auto and is a few
liters shy of spec.
