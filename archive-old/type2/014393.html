&gt; Hi, all,
&gt;
&gt; A lad wants to buy the roof rack off my parts bus, but I have no idea of the
&gt; value. can someone help me?
&gt;
&gt; It is a full-length rack made of round tube (not home-made, but I am not
&gt; certain if it is a VW part... better think it's an aftermarket one). It is
&gt; sound but rusty.

Look at the aft end of the rack.  If there's a blue sticker there it is an
aftermarket rack sold through dealers.
&gt;
&gt; Any idea of what it's worth?

Well, these aren't nearly as valuable as the wood-slat variety.  In good
shape $100-200, but rusty would be less.  A lot has to do with where you
live and how often these racks become available.  I got mine for free from
a fellow who approached my wife in a supermarket parking lot.  He had one
but sold the bus and was tired of having it hanging in his garage!
