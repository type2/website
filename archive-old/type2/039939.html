Subject: Bus Depot closed Wednesday

We're running a bit behind on shipping, so I've decided to close the phone
lines for a day and stop taking new orders, in favor of spending a solid day
doing nothing but getting the existing orders out the door.  So we will not
be taking any phone calls tomorrow (Wednesday).  Sorry for any
inconvenience, but it seems only fair to prioritize existing orders over
taking new business if things get backed up.  By Thursday everything should
be caught up, and we'll resume our normal phone hours of 11-7 e.d.t.  Of
course, the website will remain open on Wednesday so you can always go
there.
Thanks,
