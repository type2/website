Chris and the List,

&lt;Can the cabinet and overhead be installed with out tearing up the
headliner? &gt;

The cabinet can be with little damage.  You may stretch the headliner a bit
when the cabinet is pushed against it to get it in place.  The overhead
shelf requires holes through the headliner to attach.

&lt;Will there be any compatibility problems installing the windows? The
Jalousies require 15 screws per window.  Will I need to tap some holes for a
good fit or can I just drill pilot holes and use self tapping screws?&gt;

The jalousie windows will fit, but will leave the headliner material that is
glued around the window area exposed.  Westys came with a rubber trim piece
that fit around the windows on the inside, but no one has hardly even seen
one let alone be able to find replacements.  You do not need to tap holes
for the screws as the screws thread into the windows themselves.  You need
to drill clearance holes for the screws to go through.  New external
gaskets/seals are readily available for the jalousies and are cheap, but you
probably don't need them though as they are not damaged on removal.

Probably the biggest thing if you are worried about being able to go back to
original condition is replacing the original windows.  They are a pain to
remove without damaging the rubber, especially around the vent windows.  I
personally like the jalousies as I can leave them open even when it rains
and have good ventilation.  A must for camping.  I even plan to replace the
left rear window with a solid piece of glass as on the right in order to get
away from the vent window leaking water.

This conversion has been done by a lot of people to varying degrees.  Josh
Rodgers has the bed and cabinet in his '69.  Don't know about the shelf and
he did not put in the jalousies. 

Good luck!
