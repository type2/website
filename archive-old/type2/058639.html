&gt; from my mistake and put the '73 flywheel on the donor engine straight

    I kept the '73 bellhousing, and put the '73 flywheel and clutch on
first time around -- the clutch didn't last very long. So then I took a
rotary rasp and machined out the high spots inside the bellhousing so
the 228mm flywheel and clutch would fit. That worked, but then required
a starter from an automatic -- which is not a bad deal at all, since the
automatic starter is bigger and slightly more powerful.
    Now I'm putting the bellhousing from a 091 tranny on my 002 tranny
-- better fit, can use either starter.
