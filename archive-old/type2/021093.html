Subject: Run-on cutoff solenoid

The run-on solenoid (which uses power all the time the ignition is on to
stay open) need not be replaced if bad- just clip off the plunger rod
and reinsert the solenoid to fill the void.  Did this to my 71 and ran
for years like that- rarely ever had run-on....just leave it in gear
when you stop the engine.
