Subject: [T2] poptop seals, so many vendors??

Hello listmembers,

I finally picked up my new Westfalia (76) from my mechanic this morning,
and tool it to get smogged which it has not been since 1995. I passed!
wow, I just stood there looking at the guy thinking, &quot;alright, how bad is 
it?&quot; whoopee!

Anyway, I need to replace the poptop seal pretty bad. Theres about an inch 
of moss between the pieces that are still there and the fiberglass so it 
looks like I will have to replace the whole thing. Thankfully the poptop 
itself is still holding together, but it feels somewhat brittle so we'll see 
how long it holds.

Busdepot_dot_com, poptops_dot_com, gowesty_dot_com, and bus-boys_dot_com all have 
replacement seals. All of them mention having the &quot;good kind&quot; referring to 
the little clips being inside the rubber channel so they don't rust. I think 
bus-boys even mention using aluminum to hold it to the top instead of the 
steel pinch clips.  They are all about the same price, more or less, if 
anyone has had particulary good results with one of these, I would love to 
hear about it. Some come with an adhesive for the &quot;flat seal&quot; and some just 
don't mention it, do I need this sealant and if so are the ones that don't 
mention it going to tell me to go find it at a hardware store or something.

any tips on this would be appreciatted.

Thanks,

Christopher
76 Westfalia - awaiting a name yet
