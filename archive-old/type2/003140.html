Subject: Table leg

Just wondering if anybody has an extra table leg like the one on my 72
Westy. It is the kind that folds up to the side of the wall and when you
bring the table out it screws into the floor. I just need the leg, NOT THE
TABLE if anyone has one to sell. It can be scraped up bad, I am going to
paint it anyway. I am in Charlotte, NC.

Thanks in advance,
Rob
