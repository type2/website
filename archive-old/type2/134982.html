&gt; Bosch or Ford they both do the exact same thing. The point that I am
making is that the 50 wire from the ignition switch is not turning the
starter motor. It is simply pulling the solinoid and holding it.

Okay.  I didn't question this and never intended for the WR1 kit to fix
this.  I was fixing the inherent problem with 27 year old wiring.

&gt; The only advantage the relay has is in aiding the pull and hold current to
the solinoid, not the starter motor.

Which, again, is why I installed the kit.

&gt; Shot starter motors is 9 out of 10 reasons why people waste there time and
money on these things.

And the $20.00 WR1 kit is an inexpensive method of eliminating a possible
problem with the starter.

&gt; In fact they do more harm then good, adding more potential wiring
problems, loose connections, shorts, ect.

That depends on who installs it and how well they do it.

&gt; I will repeat my statment: The current that drives the starter motor does
not go throught the ignition switch.

Of course it doesn't.  I never questioned this, nor did I say that I was
trying to fix the starter itself by making sure the solinoid was getting
enough power to do its job.
