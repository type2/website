owns it knows nothing about it.  It was given to him as part of an
inheritance.

It seems to be in good shape, a few spots of rust, esp. on the part above
the sliding door.  Has 76810 miles on it.

I'm planning to travel around the US and Mexico, so I am real concerned
about what to look for on these things.  Any problems, or maintenance things
to look for?

In 1978 I had a 1960?? campmobile and went all over the east coast of the
US.
