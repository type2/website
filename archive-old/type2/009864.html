&gt; &gt;I asked the 
&gt; &gt;body guy  about Kool-patch, and he didn't like it.  He said it never
really 
&gt; &gt;dries and you can't paint over it.  
&gt; He is correct.  It remains tacky and will come off on shoes, hands, whatever
&gt; touches it.  Don't put it in an area unless it will be covered with
&gt; something.


If you want a product that is stickier, will dry to a hard, non-sticky
coating,
use 'coal tar epoxy'. Used in industrial situations where moisture,
high wear and even chemical attacks are common. Made by a bunch of
manufacturers, it is a little harder to come by, but indistrial supply places
and professional painting places should be able to get it.

It is not as cheap, though, mabye 3 times the cost of cool-patch. But, if
you are going to spend 3 days on your back painting the underside, isn't
the extra $50 worth it?

BTW, someone mentioned using rubber tiles instead of Q Pads. Regular
asphalt floor tiles are also good. Even the rubber door mats from the $1
store (.3 x .5 meters) work well, but they are heavy! Both are closed cell,
easy to find, easy to cut and should not fall apart this century. (Only
7 months left, though....) Paint before and after installation though,
as the adhesive is urea based and the acid will rust the metal.
