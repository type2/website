Subject: Will this work as fuel line shut-off valve

I'm thinking about putting a manual shut-off valve near the tank
outlet.  I called NAPA and they had nothing.  I went to the local marine
supply store and they had nothing that would work.  I then went to Home
Depot where they had a small shut-off valve that will work for water and
oil.

Does anyone know if a valve is approved for oil whether it is suitable
for gasoline?
