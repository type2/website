Subject: Ohio Bus event in May

Only 2 months to go until the Third Annual VW Buses,
Boats, &amp; Bands Bash May 16-18. The event is in
Oregonia, Ohio (36 miles north of Cincinnati) Here's
the web page:
http://www.geocities_dot_com/buses_n_boats
Anyway, I need to give the campground owner an
&quot;Estimate&quot; of how many people to expect by the end of
this month (personally, I expect at least 100 people).
So if you are even CONSIDERING coming, please drop me
a line and let me know, I promise that I will not hold
you to it if something comes up and you are unable to
attend. For logistic purposes of reserving the best
suited area of the campground, an approximate number
would be helpful.
By the way the event will feature Camping, Canoeing,
LIVE music in the campground, and of course the World
Famous Full Moon Bus Club Breakfast Burritos! And
chances are that someone will build a fire at some
point in time ;^)

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
