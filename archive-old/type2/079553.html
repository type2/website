&gt; I have a 1972 Westy.  So, my problem:  This past August I was changing the oil and I decided (unfortunately) to clean the oil screen.  But when I tightened the bolt under the oil screen I (actually, my boyfriend) tightened it too far and we heard a loud sound...  so I read the John Muir book and it said that we probably destroyed the camshaft.  Anyway the engine developed an oil leak on the left side and the oil light began to flash on and off.  Basically, I figured that destroying the camshaft cracked my engine block.  =(

don't assume this is true...very likely the damage is far less
&gt; 
&gt; The engine was in pretty good shape before this...the guy (Vanagain in Millville, NJ--they're awesome!) who replaced the rear engine seal recently said that it looked like it had been rebuilt in the past.  
&gt; 
&gt;  Another mechanic (he's not a VW mechanic...just a foreign car
&gt; mechanic) I talked to said he can fix my bus &quot;on the side&quot; by getting a
&gt; used engine block at a junk yard and taking my engine apart and putting
&gt; the parts of my engine back into this new block.  My question for you
&gt; all
&gt; is this:  Is it just that simple?  Will the parts inside my engine fit
&gt; properly in a different block?  Or would you recommend getting a totally
&gt; different engine?  If so, where can I find a used engine, and how do I
&gt; know if it's ok?  

GET A NEW MECHANIC.  anyone making that kind of offer without taking a
good look at the engine is someone I don't want touching my engine.

yes it &quot;MAY&quot; work if the engines are of the same type.

what I did when I needed to get my van on the road while fixing my main
engine.
  I hit the junkyards until I found a usable engine, nursed it along until
I could get my main engine rebuilt 

DON'T be conned by glitzy ads in the VW magazines most of them especially
GEX are not worth wasting your money on.

good luck
