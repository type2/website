Subject: Re: [T2] Re: radio

Very interesting, Jamie.  Thanks.  I wonder what that wire is  for?  I'm going to have a look and see if I can find it in  mine.  Neal, what kind of speakers are you going to install in the  hatch?  It's not thick enough to give you much room.  I'm  trying to figure out where to put some new 6x9's.  I may have to  take out the cabinet under the rear bench and replace the front panel  (with that useless little door) with a solid one and mount them in  there.  I've got 5 1/4's in the doors.  The holes were  already cut when I got the bus.  Parts Express has a great deal on  some closeout Blaupunkt speakers.  I think the 5 1/4's were  $35/pair and the 6x9's $56.  And they're marine rated.   Cheers...KR

If you look around in the right side hatch hinge area.. you might find a 
wire or 2,, the wire resembles mig welding wire... it is painted. It may be 
held in place at the very back with a gob of putty or seam sealer like 
material. 

That wire runs from the rear hatch hinge area... to the glove box area. 

You can use it as a fish wire to attach speaker wire to... and pull it thru 
the body.... 

I have seen it in many buses .. maybe it is in yours.
