Subject: Electrical Weirdness

Yesterday morning, I went out to start my 73 Westy for the first time
after a 4&quot; rainfall on Saturday.  I've got a pretty bad leak at my
windshield and every heavy rain gets things pretty wet under my dash,
but its been dry and 95 degrees here for 2 full days now since the rain.


I turned the key to 'on' and all the dummy lights came on, but when I
turned the key to 'start', the dummy lights all flashed on and off
rapidly and there was a loud clicking from the dash.  Being the rocket
scientist that I am, I turned the key off and tried it again.  This
time, after the dummy lights flashed a few times, everything went deader
than a door nail and stayed that way.  So I took the 914 to work
instead.

Last night I went out, armed with my trusty multimeter prepared to do
extensive battle with electrical gremlins.  Hopped in, turn the key to
'on' and...  the dummy lights came on, just like normal.  Pushed in the
clutch and turned the key to 'start' and the damned thing fired right
up!  

Now, I know I'm not imagining things because all the presets on my radio
were wiped out so I definitely experienced a 'dead' condition.  I just
don't know how it repaired itself.  I turned on every electrical
accessory in there including brake lights and defunct rear window
defrogger.  No problem.  Just got in to work after having driven the bus
for 20 miles and again, no problem.  Any ideas??

I'm a little concerned about this problem since I'm leaving next week
for a 2500 mile trip through Texas, New Mexico, to Jerome, and back
again.
