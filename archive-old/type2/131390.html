Subject: RE: [T2] Warning buzzer for lights

Hey, Bart, good to hear from you...

I did a search in the archives for     warning buzzer   and I got 60 hits!!  
The very first one was my posting on this subject.   here it is:

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/037922.html

also,original credit goes to&gt;&gt;&gt;   Mark Rokus:

This really works well for me.

It would be neat if this kind of info could be submitted to someone 
(referee) who could evaluate it and post it in the LIBRARY...
