Subject: distributor play

Howdi all I'm new to the list and I'm enjoying all the usefull info that
I'm getting .My question is , does anyone know how much play I'm allowed
in my distributor shaft before it needs to be rebuilt? When I grab the
top of the shaft + hold the housing the shaft feels a little sloppy +
the points slightly open +close . Is there a spec on this + is there a
new bushing I could buy if it needs to be replaced?   Dist # vw

  Thanks
