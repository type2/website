Subject: '78 bus for sale, Michigan

Hello all,

        this is not my bus, but it is one that Mark J. &amp; I spent several 
hours checking out.  I'm just passing the word on.

        It's a '78 bus, 7 passenger.  Gas heater, works.  130k miles plus
however many the PO put on it when the speedo cable was broken.  Engine
appears to be original according to serial number.  Needs an exhaust now
(rust).  It's lived mostly in Colorado (sand, not salt) but has been here
for a couple of years.  Assorted dings &amp; dents, but not ugly.  Driver's
side rocker has rust-out ~3/4&quot; wide by over 1' long.  Sliding door side
rocker has ~3/4&quot; wide by several inches long rust through.  Interior is
fine; no major rips noticed.  Oh, int. is brown.  Compression ranges from
105-120psi.  Still fuel injected.  Tires have plenty of adequate tread. 
Neither brakes nor clutch nor shocks have been replaced in the last 30k,
so they could be due.  Lots of miles betwen CA/CO/MI.  No excessive play
in the steering box.  Comes w/ a Bentley &amp; a bike rack.  Several inches of
foam/rubber engine seal strip missing at the right rear (between tin &amp;
body).  Sub-mm play perpendicular to axle detected in right axle/cv's. 
Mark &amp; I felt that the engine was a tad on the hot side after driving a
few miles around town, but that's a touchy-feely impression; may be o.k. 

        Overall feel is used, not abused.  Asking price is 
$1500--definitely seems to be in the ballpark.  Only thing that it seems 
to need &quot;today&quot; is the exhaust (rust-out just before the muffler).  
Muffler should be replaced at the same time, IMHO.  It could be due for 
lots &amp; lots of routine (or semi-routine) repairs, and would need rocker 
replacement &amp; medium dent/ding repair (&amp; therefore paint, too) to make it 
actually pretty.  Shocks, brakes, cv's &amp; clutch could be fine for years 
or all decide to &quot;expire&quot; tomorrow.

        The seller is David; email via his wife's account at 
lgbell_at_umich_dot_edu.  I have the phone number somewhere... the bus is in 
Ypsilanti, Michigan.  (411 Pearl, actually!)  They're selling so that 
they can buy an '87 Westy.

        Please follow up to David via email.  Mark might remember some 
details that I've forgotten, but this is all of the major stuff.  Oh!  I 
took some video of the bus &amp; got some frame grabs.  (Bill C. in Cleveland 
was interested in it...)  They're up on a web page... actually, just 
sitting in this directory:

It was dark with poor lighting; better than nothing, I guess.

(p.s.:  again, this is not my bus &amp; I have no interest in it.)
