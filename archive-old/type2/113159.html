&gt; Hi, I am sorry this message is off topic, someone recomended that I look here, I am sorry if
&gt; I offended anyone...
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I am looking for a diesel westfalia. Any condition is ok, but 
&gt; preferably running or with bad head gasket/ or &quot;smaller&quot; repairs...

The diesel Vanagon was only imported for a couple of years.  They
are sort of hard to find due to the low sales numbers in N.American
market.  Try looking in the usual places, traderonline, ebay, etc.

VANAGON DIESEL TRANNY WANTED:
I would like to find a source for a Vanagon diesel 5-speed manual
transmission.  A mechanic friend of mine has a diesel V'gon with a
gronch in the 3rd gear syncros.  He wants to upgrade to a 5-sp rather
than repair his broken 4-sp tranny.  Any leads please email me off
list.  Thank you,

Jack  '73 Westfalia
Costa Mesa, California
