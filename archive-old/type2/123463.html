Subject: RE: [T2] Solar panel and propane heater?

Howdy,

I've been using a solar battery charger for a couple of years now, and have 
been pleased with the results.  I got a pretty cheap one, but haven't had 
any problems with lack of charging ability or lack of power.  I would 
recommend using a deep-cycle battery in your Bus, but have used the charger 
with a regular car battery.  YMMV.

Good luck!
