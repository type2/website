Subject: Sorry...another seatbelt question

    I know there was a rather extensive thread a while back about installing 3
point seat belts in a westy, but my needs are a little different. My wife and
I are happy as punch with the arrival of our first baby...no really I mean it.
    However, she brings with her a new bus project. I have no seatbelts in teh
rear of the vehicle. What options do I have. Can I get a set of $20 bus
eatbels from the Bus Depot? Is there an even less expensive, reliable
alternative. Bear in mind, I'm only needing lap belts, at least for the next 2
years or so.

TIA
