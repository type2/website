Don't know why this came through blank the last time. I'll try once more:

&gt;Guys, i have my Bentley right here.

&gt;Valve head diameter (1800 Fuel injection): Intake- 39.30mm  Exhaust- 33.00mm

&gt;Valve head diameter (2000 Fuel injection): Intake- 37.50mm  Exhaust- 33.00mm

Hmmm...now I'm not the brightest person with this theoretical stuff, so please bear with me: Why would VW have decided to reduce the size of the intake valve head between the 1800 and the 2000? I guess I don't understand what a larger intake valve head means except that possibly more of the air/fuel mixture has a chance to get into the cylinder on the intake stroke. Wouldn't that generally be a good thing?

&gt;Quote from &quot;engine and clutch technical data-dual carburetor AND fuel
&gt;injection engines&quot; section 5, page 84 table 'V':
&gt;
&gt;D. Camshaft:
&gt;Cam follower diameter: 23.96-23.98

Again, I ain't no jeanyus, but my understanding is that what's different is the lift of the hydraulic cam vs. solid-lifter cam. Me, I have 'em hydraulic cam in what ought to be solid cam engine, but I have 'em hydraulic lifters too. 

Thanks! Joe
