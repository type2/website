Hey there Folks,

Figured I add some info I got from Karl off-list a while back. I was
looking for some things for my 79 (stool w/ brown plaid and found
one), so this might be of use to others.

&lt;snip&gt;
76 to 79 Westies came in four exterior colors.

Mango orange = orange plaid [not in deluxe style]
Sage green = green plaid [non-deluxe + deluxe]
Dakota or Mexico biege = brown plaid
White = blue plaid

I listed them in order of ease of finding plaid material.... good
luck
finding the blue:)
&lt;/snip&gt;

I didn't find this info in the archives, so I've got it saved on my
computer. It'll get in the archives now.

Later....
