Subject: Re: [T2] fuel tank sender install was gauge won't go to 1/1

Hey,

I ripped the carpet out when fixing up my bus and found the panel cut 
right above the sender.  I thought this strange because the carpet 
looked as if factory installed.  The &quot;access&quot; hole is great for working 
on the sender.  A friend of mine has a bus and it too has the same panel 
cut on it.

My sender did not register 1/1 and it bugged me - this indicates certain 
personality traits by the way ;-) .  I  took the sender out and tweaked 
the tabs and arm and got it to  read 1/1 at full but more importantly to 
give an accurate reading at the bottom of the tank.  Witch is more 
important, knowing how much gas you got left ot seeing the 1/1 mark hit 
when you pull out of the gas station after a fill up?

&gt;&gt;I'll cut a hole in the fixed panel above the sender if I ever decide to
&gt;&gt;replace it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This was recommended in the VW workshop manual probably because it resulted
&gt;in a low labor charge for the customer.  Doing it with the engine out is
&gt;really the best way.
