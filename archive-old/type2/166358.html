 Went to the Vw show in Victoria on Sunday, and saw
 about a dozen &quot;Bays&quot;, some
 were 10/10!  One had a beautiful set of Audi rims,
 that looked very fresh, but
 could not locate the owner, so could not figure out
 the year.  They had no
 adapters, so think I will cruise the car lots and
 see if I can figure out what
 they were from. Any input on ideas?
 Also, can someone direct me to get a fuel pump
 blockoff plate for my 1.8?
