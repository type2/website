Good heavens, Sir!  We do not engage in common CHIT-CHAT.  Nope. No way. Notta chance.

If you were to monitor our car to car radio transmissions, you would hear conversation
topics such as these:

(1.) &quot;Try a lower gear, you idiot&quot;

(2.) &quot;You missed the turn, you knucklehead&quot;

(3.) &quot;No, I don't have a spare quart of motor oil. Why do you ask?&quot;

(4.) &quot;Hey! Look out! Look Out!&quot;

(5.) &quot;Are those flames coming out?&quot;
