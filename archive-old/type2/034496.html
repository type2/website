Oh, these guys aren't bad. They're justa couple of crotchety old Bostoners. 
They, like most of the US these days, think of vehicles as appliances and if
you really think about it, a bus is dangerous if you have trouble thinking for
yourself or staying aware of your surroundings.

Coolest thing about these guys is that they had a garage in the 70's that
would provide the space and tools for people to come in and do their own
repairs.

forgive 'kindof' off topic post,
