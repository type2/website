Subject: Re: [T2] sizes of bolts for 68-71 rear mount

Tell him to be careful on the depth, because there is a major oil pathway
near at least one of those. Look for the oil pressure relief valve just
below. I have a case that I wanted to tap and drill for that motor mount,
and I was told that it was inadviseable to do it. Actually, this is a
complete long block with low miles that I could really use about now. Does
anyone know if this can be done safely? I was told, &quot;Don't do it&quot;.  Jan B

&gt; Does anyone know the size and pitch of the 3 molts that hold  the rear
&gt; support bar to the motor in the 68-71 buses?  I need to have a machinist
&gt; drill and tap a universal case that i havr that hasn't been tapped yet.
&gt; thanks
