&gt;60 on a gradual incline...like Denver to Leadville

Here's mine ('73 tranny (geared lower than 74-82), 2.0 hydraulic engine)

75 max, floored on a flat highway with no wind.
70 max cruising speed on a flat highway with no wind.
65 comfortable cruising speed on a flat highway with no wind.
58 economy cruising speed on a flat highway with no wind.

All other speeds concerning wind and hills totally depend on how steep the 
hill is and how strong the wind is.  For wind, generally with a 10mph 
headwind, all speeds above would be reduced by 10mph, and increased by 
10mph with a tailwind.

As for going 45-50 on a steep hill, don't do it in 4th gear, you will 
overheat.

I consider 50mph to be the mininum hill-pulling speed in 4th gear for 68-73 
busses, and 55mph minimum for 74-82.  At these speeds you are already well 
below the horsepower peak of your engine and the low (&lt;3000 rpm) speed of 
your engine will keep it from cooling as well as it needs to for high load 
conditions.  Downshift and slow down 5mph and your engine will be much happier.
