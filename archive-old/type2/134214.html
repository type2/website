Subject: Re: [T2] Propane fuel conversion on 1977?

Sluggo asked:


 Something I've wondered about the propane conversions is why mount the tank
inside the cab?
 
Since you'd only use gas to start, then switch over to propane I'd assume
you could ramove the stock tank and install a small two or three gallon one,
then you could mount the propane tank next to it.
 
 [(gas)( p  r  o  p  a  n  e  )]
 
An alternative would be to mount an outside tank under the frame by my 10
gallon propane tank for the camping stove.
 
I just would'nt want a propane tank inside the cockpit anymore than I would
a gasoline tank.  The small gas tanks are readily available from sources
like Moon Eyes, and would fit just fine.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chevy pickups for example, that are converted to propane run 100% on propane.
They do not start on gasoline and then switch.

And how big is that tank under the bed in that 72??  Here in the US, you would barely go a 
100? miles before running empty. That is the problem here: you need a monster tank to get 
anywhere. Don't forget, gasoline puts out more MPG than propane does, gallon vs gallon.
Sure, in the UK, that little bitty tank is ok.
