In Europe they were. Pretty much every two-tone bus I've seen, and I'll use
white as an example, that was white on top and colored on the bottom is also
white inside.

It appears, the entire body was painted white at the factory and then masked
and painted the bottom color from the bulge down. The front doors and rear
hatch were subject to some bottom color but the inner sliding door area was
not and the color change below the bulge ended underneath the door seal.

That bus is not white inside so I suspect it's been repainted by someone
recently.
