Subject: Heater Boxes (again)

  I received several queries for an address on the Aircraft Supply
 house. Well - a couple anyway.

 This one is a piece of cake.  It's Chief Aircraft Inc.
 e-mail &lt;Chief_at_magick_dot_net&gt;  It's nice to have some computer literate
 people out there.

 One of our group gave me some input on the &quot;heater muff&quot;. It really ain't
all it's cracked up to be. Says maybe 1/10th as good as a type4
set up.

 The propane job - well I want to see it. cum se,cum sa. Or however it's
spelled.
