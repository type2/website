Subject: Re: [Re:  HELP! Torsion arms back in?]

List,
Marc's response was very helpful and i'll be following his advice.

I learned a little trick in researching how to do this:

Sometimes, since the welds on the ends will break during removal, you'll have
trouble getting the torsion leaves to seat back in the socket up in the
torsion arm - thats why VW welded them.

You can remove the leaves, wrap both ends (about 3-4 inches in from the end)
with a few turns of masking tape to hold them together while you wrestle the
arms back on - a beetle buddy said thats what he did and it worked great.  The
masking tape will break and shouldn't cause any trouble just hanging out in
the grease for the next 30 years...
Any nay-sayers?

Make sure the leaves don't get 'unstacked' or get turned around (driver side
needs to stay driver side) and make sure during reassembly that you eyeball as
best you can the spot drilled on the leaves for the socket screw to set in
with the hole for the screw in the beam.

Pricing front end parts - busdepot looks the best so far,

clark
