Subject: RE: Sump Oil Temp Sender

&gt; We installed a sump oil temp sender and gauge and it reads no higher than
&gt; 180 on the highway. We read that these senders tend to run on the low side
&gt; which makes sense because the engine seems to get up to normal temperature
&gt; (feeling the dipstick). Any comments on this?

I recently installed a VDO sump oil temp sender and gauge and calibrated it
with an accurate thermocouple (stuck the probe down the dipstick tube until
well-immersed in the oil).  It reads right on the money by my test.  On my
'79 Westy at highway speeds, oil temperature is about 130-140 degrees above
air temperature - so about 200-210 on a 70 degree day.  In general, though,
the later engines seem to run hotter than the earlier ones, so 180 for a '68
may be about right.
