&gt; Well, now I'm confused.  In the first post you said you couldn't get the
&gt; timing right because the vacuum advance can hit the cold start valve, but
&gt; here you say you set the timing to 7 degrees BTDC.  Since 7 degrees BTDC
&gt; *is* correct timing for this engine, you can understand my confusion.

That was with a new distributor. When I put the old one back in I could set
it properly. But now it doesn't work.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, if the engine was running fine before you started messing around,
&gt; there's only two explanations: 1) there's something wrong with the new
&gt; distributor, or 2) your messing around has messed something up.

Well, that's just what's got me flummoxed. I've gone through there over and
over again. I thought this would be a simple swap procedure. I few folks
have suggested a 180 degrees out thing, but you can't put these distributors
in the wrong way.
&gt; 
&gt; For the life of me, I can't figure out how the re-assembly of a distributor
&gt; (your new rebuilt one) could result in a 25 degree &quot;off&quot; situation with the
&gt; timing.  Do you still have the old distributor?  Can you place them
&gt; side-by-side, both with rotors aimed at the #1 timing notch, and look at the
&gt; drive dogs and see a difference?

That's just it, the drive Cogs at the bottom of the new distributor drive
shaft are aligned 25 degrees or so different from the rotor, compared to the
old one. I would have thought this would be a fixed thing, regardless of
distributor. It's not like the drive is loose or anything.
