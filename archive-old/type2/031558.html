&gt; Got a VDO elecgtric pressure sender and a gauge from Bus Depot a while

sorry should have answered.

from memory.
  the sender has two terminals.
   one goes to the S terminal on the gauge
   the other goes to the idiot light 

the + terminal should tap into your instrument lights
    - is ground

if the gauge jumps to the highest on start up and does not indicate
presure, then switch the wires on the sender.  one is off/on the other is
graduated

&gt; stayed there.  It is responding to pressure, since coasting sith the
&gt; clutch in or out down a hill with the engine off gave the same reading
&gt; when in gear.   Did I hook this up wrong??  MB 78 Westy
