Subject: Riviera Conversion

I spent most of the day yesterday installing an ASI Riviera Penthouse top on
Gretta, my '72 bus.  The install is pretty much done, and I think the
anxiety from cutting a huge hole in my baby is finally starting to subside.
Of course, as with any major project like this, I have a few questions...

Does anyone know of a good supplier for replacement seals for the Riviera?
I was looking at www.trimlok_dot_com and it looks like they have a couple seals
that might work well.  The original seal seems to be fairly simple, just a
square edge that rests on the roof.  I wonder if a seal with a small bulb
might not tend to seal a bit better to protect against wind and rain?

What thickness is the original top mattress for the Riviera?  There was no
matress available with the poptop, so I will have to start from scratch.  I
think the top mattress in my Westy is 2&quot; high density foam.  Would this work
well for the Riviera also?  If anyone has an original Riviera mattress that
they could pull dimensions from I would be eternally grateful.

						Thanks in advance,
