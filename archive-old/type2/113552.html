Ring....Ring, &quot;Doktor Tim, how can I help you?&quot;

Quicky Lube, &quot;High Doktor, this is Fergus at Quicky lube. We got a VW here 
cause you told the owner the lube was foul in the tranny and needed 
changing so I found the drain plug and finally got it out with the Vice 
Grips. I finally found the fill plug but I can't get the Vice Grips on it 
so can we borrow your spezial tool.&quot;

DT &quot;Did you check the Bentley??&quot;

QL &quot;No, it's a VW.&quot;

DT &quot;Don't you have any manuals??&quot;

QL &quot;Well, they don't go back this far.&quot;

DT &quot;Why did you agree to service a vehicle you are unequipped to do properly??&quot;

QL &quot;Hey, I did a thousand oil changes last month what do you mean I am 
unequipped??&quot;

DT &quot;Thank you for calling.&quot; CLICK!!

This happens several times per year. Shops call me for free advise and free 
tool rental so they can break my rice bowl at my expense.
