Subject: Porsche Engines in busses

Hi all 

I've just been reading Jeremy Johnson's account of the Puyallup show and
in particular the guy who put a 911 engine in his bus. This got me
thinking how that would be really something. Does anyone know any
information about such engine conversions as I think that it would make
interesting reading/ maybe even a project. 
If anyone knows any info please p-mail me as i don't wish to take up
bandwidth with this subject. Which is probably not of interest to most
of you people
