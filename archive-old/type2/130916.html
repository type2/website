Subject: 78/79 FI parts compatability

Hi,
can I use the air flow sensor from a 78 on my 79?
As some of you may already know, someone opened the lid on my air flow 
sensor a while back and adjusted the spring on the inside.  I have not been 
able to get it to run right since then.  I even tried to adjust the spring 
back, but they weren't sure where it originally was. I have a spare from a 
78 and was wondering if it would be better to use this.
thanks,
Kyle
