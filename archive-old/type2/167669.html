&gt; My Bus?  She gets driven all over the place.  Usually my daily driver.
&gt;
&gt; Usually, the bus hauls me, the wife, our 3 large dogs (about 225 lbs
&gt; worth of 'em), plus all our clothes &amp; supplies to Daytona about once a
&gt; month or so.  300 miles round trip, and I enjoy every mile of it.
&gt;
&gt; No, I doubt my bus will ever be a garage maiden.  She'll end up pretty
&gt; when I'm done, but never relegated to sulking in the garage, waiting for
&gt; a weekend without rain.

&gt; My intuition tells me that folks like us here that

&gt; Like when do you ever see another 35 year old anything
&gt; that isn't pristine but is instead hauling a well pump
&gt; or a dozen beehives or 300# of onions or more weight


for sure, your more likely to find me and my bus loading lumber at he
local Home Depot than any show, it is daily driver year round rain, snow,
sun etc,  right now it is really bugging me that it isn't back on the road
yet.  have some stuff piling up here that needs to get to the dump.
finally got a nice new wiring harness from Kyle Automotive, pricy but
nice.  now the engine is making a noise I can't find...one dang thing
after another...

time to start saving nickels for Boston Bob.
