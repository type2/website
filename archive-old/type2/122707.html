From: Kevin Sullivan &lt;kombilover_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

Well,
Amanda is on the road again.  How can you describe Amanda? Spicoli-esque to
say the least!  She is traveling around looking for a party.  She may be
going to Iowa City to visit her father for Christmas but not for long.  She
expects to be in N'orleans for Mardi Gras in February but until then she is
going to have to find a fun/warm place to hang her hammock.  Oh, if you
meet her ask her about &quot;Cat the other white meat&quot;.
