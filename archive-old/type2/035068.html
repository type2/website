In my case, it's not the heads that need cooling, but the oil.  I was
thinking about drilling a hole in the left side tin just over the oil
cooler and mounting the nozzle there, to spray down onto only the oil
cooler.  Now that I think about it, it would have to go in from the side
because of the flap, but it is definately do-able.  Besides, I don't like
the idea of water hitting the cylinder heads directly.  Potential for
trouble there.  Overall though I think an external cooler is a better
solution.
