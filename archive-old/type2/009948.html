	Skye,
	Go buy or borrow &quot;How to keep your VW alive, a book of
step by step procedures for the complete idiot&quot; by John Muir. Get
the newest edition you can so it has all the corrections and updates
for later model engnines- there's a 25th aniversary edition that came
out recently, that would be a good one. 
	Read the general description chapter and the how to buy a VW
chapter, although you already own this bus. You clearly are getting
surprised and need to make a thorough apprasal of what you've got
before you go any further.
	Then follow what the book has to say about brake trouble shooting
(and troubleshooting other problems you've got) until you have a sense
of what your bus needs. 

	They buy or borrow one (at least) of either the Haynes VW Bus
manual for your model OR the factory Bentley manual for your model
of bus. Haynes are cheaper, check used book stores for all three
manuals. But you MUST have one and should have at least two.

	Meanwhile, here's leg-up for you. If your brake pedal really
goes all the way to the floor and you have no braking power then
its LIKELY your brake system is leaking. Could be a very benign leak
that simply emptied the system gradually over the last 10 years, or
a bad seal in one of the wheel cylinders (back) or calipers (front)
or master cylinder (under the pedals).

	Here's a quick and cheap diagnostic technique for you. Using
ANY of the three manuals listed above, check your brake fluid resevior.
If its low (and I'll guess it is) then top it up with DOT3 or DOT4 brake
fluid. Buy a funnel to help get the fluid into the resevior and nowhere
else- brake fluid removes paint, leading to rust and isn't nice
stuff in general. Did the pedal firm up after that? Check the level
again, top up as needed and pump the pedal again a few times. You'll
PROBABLY need to bleed the air out of the system but we'll get
there one step at a time.

	NEXT, inspect your front brake pads
for thickness and your rear shoes for thickness. You may never have
done this before but you can, with a flashlight and a screw driver and
maybe the jack and wheel-lug wrench for the fronts. Oh yeah, a ruler.
You'll get your hands dirty and might want to wear clothes suitable for
crawling under the bus, which you'll have to do. I GUARANTEE you can
do this inspection yourself, with no help but the book, in less than 2 hours
&gt;from start to finished with clean hands. If you have a friend to read
the book and a little luck you can get this done in 1/2 hour or less. 
With experience maybe 10 minutes.

	This inspection will tell you whether your pads are worn out,
whether your shoes are worn out, whether your rotors are generally ok
or not. If you keep your eyes open while doing the inspection, you'll
notice if there's a big leak mark and a trail of brake fluid (its an
heavy alcohol actually, but feels like a light oil. WASH YOUR HANDS
after touching it) at one or more of your four wheels.

	IF the pads and shoes are all good, and the rotors look good,
then check the master cylinder. Look at the metal cover that protects
the under-pedal area- is it still there? Does it have brake fluid dripping
out from it? Take it off and find the master cylinder. Its the gizmo that
looks like stick you'd throw for a dog that's connected to the brake
pedal and has two hydraulic lines connecting to it, and plastic line to
the brake fluid resivior. Is brake fluid leaking out anywhere? 

	If you haven't found a leak yet, or even if you have, take that
flashlight and follow the hard metal hoses from the master cylinder out
to the four corners, where rubber hoses connect the the hard pipes to
the wheel cylinders/calipers. See any leaks? If fluid leaks out of
a place where a pipe screws into something then try gently tightening
the fitting- if it was loose you may have fixed the problem.

	Here's one more easter-egg to look for. On the brake calipers and
the rear wheel cylinder there are 'bleeder valves' which are little
bolts (10mm, or less) with holes drilled down through them and with a
nipple profile above the flats for the wrench. You're supposed to put a
rubber tube on the nipple to convey brake fluid to a catch container
when you bleed the system. I've gone on at tiresome lenght about
bleeding and you can find it in the archives, or any manual. Check
to see if the bleeders are loose. DON'T open them- just make sure they're
closed- turn them clockwise, screw them INTO the cylinder/caliper. 

	You've now spent a little money on brake fluid and either time
or money getting manuals. And you've learned a lot about your brakes.
And you'll have a good idea what's wrong. On an old bus you could have
multiple problems- low fluid from a mystery leak, a leaking master cylinder,
worn-out pads, worn out rotors, less likely but possible, worn out shoes
or drums in the rear. Leaking calipers. Leaking slave cylinders. Leaking
rubber hoses. Loose couplings. 

	Happy motoring
	Bill
