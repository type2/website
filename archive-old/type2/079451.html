Subject: Search: Heating with water


(i forgot to mention that it is experimental, huh)

I managed to break (not really..I ran into a documented feature that I
didnt read about before when i reindexed to get more speed out of it last
night.) the search i posted. :)

http://www.type2_dot_com/cgi-bin/htsearch?restrict=;exclude=;config=htdig.vanagon;method=boolean;format=builtin-long;sort=score;words=water%20and%20heater%20not%20cataly;page=1

and

http://www.type2_dot_com/cgi-bin/htsearch?restrict=;exclude=;config=htdig.type2;method=boolean;format=builtin-long;sort=score;words=water%20and%20heater%20not%20cataly;page=1

should get you the results you are looking for on the old search, while i
try and figure out a workaround for the stop-list which seems to be nicely
excluding all of our popular search terms! whee.
