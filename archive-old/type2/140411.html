Subject: RE: [T2] Alternator cooling boot

Ok, a little more investigation shows that the two groove in which the fan
shroud sits, is a smaller diameter than what I originally had.  You can see
the difference here:
http://wical_dot_com/wp/wp-gallery2.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=4392

Part# for old boot = 021-903-655D
Part# for new boot = 021-903-655B

Not sure what the differences are here.  Do I just have the wrong version of
the part I need?  This new one is definitely not going to work.

&quot;Never regret. If it's good, it's wonderful. If it's bad, it's experience.&quot;
