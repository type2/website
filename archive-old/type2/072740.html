Subject: I'm off on the Oregon trail

Monday morning I'm leaving for a trip to Portland to research
neotraditional (new urbanist) developments (ask Bulley?) for the town in
which I live.  Leaving Centerville, Utah up I-84 past Boise, the US 26 to
Prineville, Redmond, Madras, Rhododendrom and into Portland.  If any one
sees a dead '87 silver weekender on the side of any of these roads, I hope
its not me.  (But Stop anyway).

Does anyone know  a good potty stop or  rest area or camp or city park on
US 26 west of Ontario, Oregon that we can lay over Monday Night in.  (Free
is best).

In Portland we've come to see the new developments of Orenco Station,
Fairview, and Sunnyside Village.  Anyone able to give us some clear
directions to these destinations.  We'll probably be staying in the
Troutsdale area.

After Portland, we're planning to head south taking in a little of the
Oregon Coast.  Then through Grants Pass and Ashland (I've heard Ashlands a
neat town).  Then backtrack to and down US 199 to Crecent City Calif.

From there well have to see how the wife is holding out.  She's 4 weeks
into a new knee and it may be time to head home.  We'll just have to see.

Wish us luck and any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Have fun
