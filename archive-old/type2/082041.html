Subject: [T2] converting tin for doghouse

&gt;Just wondering if anyone has ever taken the rear tin for a non-doghouse style shroud, and cut a hole in the back to accept &gt;
&gt;the doghouse style shroud?  This is the piece that seals the engine to the wall.  Would this work?

Ruf. Ruf Ruf Ruf. But it wotks just fine.
