&gt;4-6volts at fuel pump with fuel pump disconneted? or connected and

4-6 reading the voltage across the bus' fuel pump wires connected or disconnected, as it doesn't matter.

&gt;Disconnected, you should see full voltage on the wires.

Why would you see a difference in voltage?

&gt;Billy, if you have 32-35, it should start.

I was only able to get this pressure via a remote battery supplying the pump with a decent 12volts.

&gt;Did you get the main FI plug back into the ECU nice and tight?
&gt;No bent pins?

Pretty sure, will check.

&gt;Trigger wire from coil to ecu on the correct coil connector?

Never touched it.

&gt;Hmmmmmmmm, still gotta be something simple(yeah, right).
&gt;
&gt;Might be double relay...as in unplug and replug to clean contacts a 
&gt;little.

The double relay switches 12volts to the pump right? I'm only getting 6. Will do the Bentley double relay test procedure today.

Billy
