&gt; ...Bad ATF leak from...

Ouch. Sounds like the seal between the torque converter and the transmission/
differential. 

Been there, done that. 

I don't know that this seal was horrendously expensive, but it is 
impossible to get at without removing a) the engine, or b) the 
transmission/ differential unit. The time commitment (or cost if you have 
someone else do this) of getting at it will dwarf the cost of the part.

I've never done it by removing the transmission- only the engine. It may 
be possible. I'm not sure which might be less work- both are a pain, 
though fairly straightforward.

Why it's leaking again if you recently replaced it is mysterious. Maybe 
you got it in slightly crooked, or maybe the bushing in the torque 
converter is so worn that there's a lot of slop in the movement? Lessee, 
I guess it could be an engine problem like way too much longitudinal play 
in the crankshaft, or something really awful like a broken crankshaft- 
but you'd probably have other noisy engine symptoms in that case. 

I'm told that torque converters can wear out in time. I had one rebuilt 
once for about $110 at a torque converter specialist shop. 

I had the bearing in a torque converter replaced once- bearing was just a 
few bucks. 

As I recall, the ATF would sling all over everything, including the 
exhaust system, producing spectacular amounts of white smoke. Not pretty.

Good luck, esp. WRT your impending trip.
