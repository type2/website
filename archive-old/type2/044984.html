&gt; Good advice, and not just for women, after all, wasn't it Michael Jordan's
&gt; father who was murdered while sleeping in his car at a rest stop in North
&gt; Carolina?

Yes it was, and the strange thing here is that Jordan's dad knew the area he
was in when he was murdered. The rest stop wasn't far from a hotel, and Mr.
Jordan was not in need of money.

It gets sicker: One of the two guys who killed him made a home video a
little later. In it he was wearing the NBA Championship ring Michael Jordan
gave his dad, and that the murderers stole from Mr. Jordan after they killed
him. They were also seen driving Mr. Jordan's white Lexus.
