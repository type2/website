Subject: engine diagnostic anyone?

Hi people

I have been working on my 78 to put it back on the road.
Its a FI as some of you will remember, I’ve posted a while ago about
related problems...
Lately, I fixed a leak near the auxiliary regulator.
Now the engine will start (high RPM)but unless I push on the gas pedal
It will dies until it gets warmer. When it gets warmer, the engine will
go on a funny cycle, almost dying every 20 or so seconds, shaking the
buss like hell, and it will start again at high RPM and so on.
The idle screw doesnt affect anything - wide open or all the way down,
no noticeable difference (to an untrained ear anyway).

any ideas?  Air Flow Meter?

thanks!!
