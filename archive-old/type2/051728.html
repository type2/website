Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuilt Half Axles/ Autozone $99

I've installed about a dozen of NAPA's &quot;remanufactured&quot; half shafts on
various customer's cars over the years.  Haven't had a come-back yet. 
(About the same price as Autozone's.  Probably the same company.)  I
don't hesitate to use them. (However, NAPA is much more ubiquitous
than Autozone.)  NAPA's have the famous 'lifetime' warranty.
