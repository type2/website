Subject: engine update 

thanks to all who submitted great suggestion i might
not have put it in the email i send lastnight but 

the gas tank has been pulled and lined

my new vdo fuel sender is on the way 

so is the filler neck seal that is attached to the
inside body where the gas station pump would go into
my old one is cracked and most times i would fill my
bus up with gasoline it would find it's way throught
the crack and roll down the inside of my bus to the
ground so i am solving the problem

drive safely sam

76 bus
04 jetta
