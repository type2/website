&gt;To all of you CBers out there in BusLand.  Where did you mount your
antennea?
&gt;There seems to be a lot of options but I want to most convient, cheap, best
&gt;working, and best looking option out there.  Any suggestions?

Well Brett,

It is easiest to describe the best working antenna location/mount/and type
(although there could be lots of argument on the specifics of the type
ofantenna).  Unless you have room for an 18 foot antenna you are going to be
using a 1/4 wavelength whip or a variation on it.  Quarter wave whips need to
work agains a ground plane.  The best ground plane your bus has is the top of
the bus, and (for optimal performance) the best place to locate your antenna
is spang in the middle of the roof.  You drill a hole there and bolt down a
spring mount for a 9-foot (approximately) tall whip antenna.  Make sure that
the mount makes electrical connection to the bus roof (I didn't say make sure
the whip makes electrical connection to the roof!)  Inside the bus, run
coaxial cable to your CB rig.  You have the best working practical antenna
setup for a bus.

What's that?  You  want to park your bus in covered garages, don't want to
take out the gas station's lighting every time you gas up, can't stand to
think about drilling a hole in your bus's roof, etc?  Well then, you'll have
to figure out a compromise that suits you.  

One compromise not to try, unless you just like the look of it and don't care
how well it works or who you can talk to, is to mount the whip real low down
on the bus's body running the whip close along the body for several feet.
  You will be making your rig pretty deaf and dumb in about half the
directions from your bus, and in the directions that you can hear (and be
heard a little) you will be throwing away half to 2/3 of the power of your
rig. 

Shortened whips use loading coils to make up for the lost length.  There are
better ones and worse ones.  Other things being equal, a center loaded whip
(coil in the middle of the whip) will outperform a base loaded whip (top
loading isn't too practical for mobile antennas).

A shortened center loaded  whip on a rain gutter mount is a pretty good
compromise in my opinion.  Just make sure that the mount makes electrical
connedtion to the gutter  (use anti corrosion paste to ward off the rust
demon),   and use good quality coax and connectors properly hooked up.
 Either use a spring mount or a quick-disconnect mount so you can get your
bus into the garage when you want to.
