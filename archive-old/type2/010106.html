Hi All,

Trish and I (plus daughter and her boyfriend) are back from the Oregon
Country Fair
(just East of Eugene)--we had a great time with all the Hippies and
Kool Folks at
the fair and, generally speaking, Lily (our 72 Westy) performed
admirably.

The following may help in solving the non-starting problem:
1.  Its a rebuilt engine, rebuilt to 2.0L; dual carbs; toggle switch
turns ignition
to &quot;on&quot; and push button starts engine.
2.  Just outside of Salem we pulled into a rest stop and couldn't
restart the
engine--pushed the button and dead silence!!
3.  Good samaritan stopped and helped us: slipped under the van on the
right side,
just in front of the back wheel--said he saw a wire that was loose (I
thought he
said it was black but I may be wrong!), re-affixed it and the engine
started.
4.  Got to the campground and the engine wouldn't start again: same
thing: total
silence.  I crawled under the car looking for a loose black wire:
didn't find one,
wiggled a black wire I did see (more towards the front of the car and
the center
than what the other guy might have been dealing with)--and ,vola, the
car started. 
So I thought that maybe I grabbed the right wire.
5.  Continue to start until we were about half-way home (Gig Harbor,
WA), we stopped
for coffee--engine wouldn't start: total silence.  I got under the car,
wiggled
aforementioned black wire--and NOTHING!!
6.  Looked at the wires hooked to the solonoid, all seemed OK (one was
loose and
still is, but seemed to be tight enuff for a connection)--still no
starting when
pushing the starter button--nada!!
7.  Pushed it to get it started--which was successful!!
8.  Drove the rest of the way home, turned the engine off--won't
restart.
9.  Checked solonoid wires again
10. Daughter's boyfriend touched both posts of the solonoid with a
screwdriver when
the toggle switch was in the on position--NOTHING.  And NOTHING when
hitting the
starter button again.
11.  We have lights, horn works, stereo works.

Questions:  
1.  What wire should I be looking for the our helper played with the
first time when
the engine wouldn't start and which caused it to start right up (by the
way, he
immediately suspected this when he first attempted to solve our
problem.
2.  Is it likely that the starter is dead?

Thanks for answers to those questions plus any other suggestions you
can supply.  We
are heading for the Redwoods in CA in 2 weeks so obviously must fix
this problem.

Peace,

Dale G
