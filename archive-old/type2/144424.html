&gt; &gt; I would not even consider letting the monkeys at

&gt; Hey Jason  I agree with this  I have to fix these all the time where these
&gt; monkeys screw up.   If these guys were real mechnics they wouldnt be working in
&gt; a Jiffy lube would they.??   I had a BMW come in with an oil leak an one of
&gt; these places put a molly type plug in the drain hole, crazy thing was that it
&gt; wasnt stripped ??  just had to get a bolt and sealing ring to fix it  later

Translation:  They dropped the original bolt and lost it, so they reached
into the box of rubber expansion plugs that they buy in bulk and popped
one in.

I often wonder if these places don't just put an expansion plug
in every car to save the trouble of stripping the threads in the first
place!  This seems to be the case here!
