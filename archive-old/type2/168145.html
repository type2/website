Subject: kudos to one of our online vendors

I am cross-posting this, as it applies to all ACVWs (as well as water 
cooled models).

A while back, I ordered a carpet set for Foster from Bus Depot.  I 
apparently left a detail out, as I got a call back from them wondering 
if I had an AT or MT.  We got that straightened out, and the order was 
processed.  This was a drop-shipment, and I have little doubt that Bus 
Depot placed the order appropriately with TMI.

A few weeks later, I got a carpet set from TMI, but they delivered a 
set for a '73 - '74 AT squareback, with a note that they did not take 
returns since each set was custom made.  I called Bus Depot about this, 
and they said to just send it to them, and they would take care of the 
rest.

After another few weeks, I got the correct carpet set.  I don't know if 
Bus Depot was able to work anything out with TMI (I rather doubt it), 
but by golly, they were able to work things out with me.

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!!

I cannot speak for everyone's experience with the Bus Depot, and I have 
had a few less than stellar transactions with them, but for the most 
part, they will continue to get my business.  I know that they cannot 
stock everything we need, and up until recently, I only bought Type 2 
stuff from them, but if I ever need anything Type 3, I will go to them 
first.

The probably have a '73 - '74 AT carpet in stock and ready to ship if 
anyone needs it.   :-)
