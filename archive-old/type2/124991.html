Subject: seating

My 71(I just sold) jump has the seatbelts but I do remember the our 68 had
no belts in the rear.  I also recall setting on the stool as a 14 year old &amp;
ending up with my face in the kick plate under the dash.  Facing the rear my
be the safest direction anyway.
I was able to find a full factory Z bed Westy put the closet over the rear.
This made room for three &amp; did do not block the right window.  So I had
seating for 6 with seatbelts for all.  Also on the left side you find the
anchor for a 3 point belt on  the Westy both sides on the wagon.

Now an 82 diesel 4th week with her &amp; like it so far this is my 6th bus.
Funny thing is that diesel sounds like an air cooled from inside. The heater works great also has the diesel auxiliary.
