Subject: Re: [T2] Why would a valve guide be leaving small bits in the
  valve cover?

Courtney,

Check the rocker arms for the correct washers and that the rockers are 
hitting the valve stems correctly according to Bentley.

Broken wavy washer on one valve?

How long has the engine been together?

Broken valve spring??

Cheers, dave

&gt; I've never come across this before. My daughters 1600 SP engine started
&gt; making a louder clatter than usual over a few months period, so I thought I
&gt; d adjust the valves. They turned out to be set correctly, but I noticed
&gt; under one valve, that fine bits of brass was collecting in the valve cover.
&gt; Enough for my eye to pick up the fine particles. I assume the clatter is
&gt; from a worn valve guide. Why would only one have this, and has anyone else
&gt; ever seen this happen? Time to replace the valve guide I guess.
