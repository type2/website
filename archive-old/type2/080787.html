Subject: [T2] side tent question


&gt; Hi,
&gt; I purchased a side tent for my Westy online.  When the tent arrived and I
&gt; attempted to set it up, I realized that I was not given all of the poles.
&gt; My many attempts to contact the seller have been unsuccessful.  The tent
is
&gt; golden yellow in color with red, white, and blue stripes on the
&gt; window/doors.  This tent does not have a floor.  I was told by someone on
&gt; the vanagon list that it seems I have purchased a 70's Westy tent and that
&gt; the Campmobile would give a diagram of how it is to be set up.
&gt;
&gt; I am inquiring to find out if anyone happens to have a Campmobile manual
&gt; that they would be willing to sell me or know of where I could obtain one?
&gt; Does anyone know how I could go about purchasing replacement poles for my
&gt; tent?
&gt; Any advise would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; Jenny Loerzel
&gt; Chicago, IL
