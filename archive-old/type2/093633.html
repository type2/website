Subject: Eberspaecher BA 6 Gas heater

Hi guys &amp; girls - Before I begin thanks for all your help, you've supplied me with plenty of information to keep my bus running.  THANKS

Now to my question - I recently discovered that a parts bus that I purchased just under a year ago is equipped with a BA6 gas heater.(211 261 105 E) is the part number on the tag.  I removed it last night.  I want to clean and test the unit before installing it into my bus.  I have the complete unit minus a couple of things.  Does anyone know where I could get it test and/or a safe procedure to test the unit myself.  Keep in mind I'm a beginer at electrical things.  I live in Rhode Island.  Please lead to me additional information regarding the heater if anyone knows of any.  I like photos, if the site has pics please let me know.  Thanks and I appreciate all your help.  Mike
