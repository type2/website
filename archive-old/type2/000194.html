Subject: 20-30 Westies and buses for sale

I am getting ready to leave the desert for Germany but only feel if fair to 
share this with all the members on the list.  Out in Newberry Springs Ca, my 
buddy has 20-30 Westies that need new homes, most are minus motors and 
trannies.  They were just donors for the sand toys and have been sitting for 
many years.  Most of the bodies are 100%rust free not that almost rust free.  
The are pretty much complete but need TLC. The westy pop-tops are all real 
bad from the winds and sand but some of the shells are still there.  They are 
going rather cheap.  EX. he sold an early sixties double door split for three 
hundred with another front clip, hole front cab area, and chassis pretty good 
deal I think.  So if any are interested you have until November 15th to 
arrange transport and funds.  I stand to gain nothing here just the happiness 
of them being put back on the road and the parts still being available in 
twenty years.
Peace Out
