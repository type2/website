Subject: Re: [T2] Really dumb newbie question .. Just checking ..

From Peter Stevens:

 Yes, the 1600 was always available on the Bay, but with the usual upright
cooling system.  The Vanagon also used an aircooled 1600 but with a unique cooling system that looked similar 
to the Type 3.  The basic engine unit was a sustantially modified version of the Type 1, with hydraulic 
lifters, oil filter, relocated oil cooler etc.  The engine was fitted until Decemeber 82 or January 83.

I believe you are referring to this engine:
