Subject: Battery full of rain water

Ashley had a sudden loss of power last week. I hadn't used him for a week
and there wasn't enough juice to start.

I pulled the battery out to charge it, unscrewed the covers over the cells
and noticed something odd - they had different amounts of water in them.
None were low but some were very high. I equalised them and charged the
battery. All is now OK.

We had had some heavy rain and I have noticed that I have sudden flat
batteries after a few days of no use and rain. I've checked with a lamp for
electrical drain and there isn't one. A new multimeter will be used soon to
be doubly sure.

The way the battery is situated and where Ashley is parked can sometimes
mean plenty of water in this area - would water leaking INTO the battery
cause it to loose charge ? My elementary understanding of batteries says
possibly but I suspect someone knows better. The battery design would allow
small pools to form over the cell covers.

Anyway, I wiped some petroleum jelly around the &quot;seals&quot; on the cell covers
to make them seal better but any comments are welcome.

Thanks

Phil
