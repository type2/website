Subject: cheap calipers


Listees,

I have been working on the brakes on my 71. At first I was going to have the 
calipers rebuilt, but my pistons were really stuck. So, Bus Depot said I can 
return my unused rebuild kits  : )  which put me in the market for 
remanufactured or rebuilt calipers as fast as I could get them. 
I called the local Auto Zone they said they could get remanufactured units 
58.99 each and they could get them Tuesday if I ordered them Friday. Sounded 
good. I went over to order them. When I got there a guy showed me they also 
had rebuilt units 38.99 each. I ordered them and am happy. 
But, I have to share with everyone what my brother found. A mail-order parts 
place. Apparently they are really into Hondas and stuff, BUT according to the 
website they have rebuilt calipers for my 71 for 22.30 each. So here is some 
info and a link for all you who may need brakes and have not already bought 
them. I have to say I haven't ordered these or have any reason to promote the 
company or anything. Just wanted to pass on the info and maybe save everyone 
some dollars!
