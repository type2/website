don't know what you did, but works fine, thanks

&gt; I finally got ahold of a fuel pressure tester today, but of course since
&gt; nothing is ever simple in my life, the gauge has a threaded fitting at the
&gt; end thus it wouldn't hook up to to the terminal on the ring main.  Not
&gt; deterred and after seriously considering cutting off the end of the gauge

cut off end of mine and use hose clamp to hold it on.

&gt; gauge fitting and the other end is made for a hose, that and a piece of fuel
&gt; line later I had adapted the gauge to fit the ring main terminal.  So I run
&gt; the starter and the gauge reads zero.  When I remove the gauge and run the

hmmmmm, try putting a bike air pump on it and see if it even works??

&gt; actually fired a couple of times, but apparently my fuel pressure is zilch. 
&gt; 
&gt; Shouldn't the fuel pressure gauge (brand new) read at least something since
&gt; fuel is being pumped?  This fuel pump is an FI pump but had been pumping to
&gt; a carb for the last couple of years, could this have over-worked it and
&gt; caused it to drop it's pressure output?

pumps are very different because of the presure, look at the price
difference too.  

&gt; My Bentley says the hose from the fuel pump connects to the pressure
&gt; regulator, but mine goes to the ring main on the left side of the engine
&gt; before eventually reaching the regulator on the other side.  Do I have
&gt; something backwards?   Looks right to me.

nope that is the correct arrangement

&gt; Last question (for now): Fuel flows from the tank out of the return hose
&gt; when unplugged from the regulator,  that's supposed to happen right?

yeah, but I put a valve on mine so I could shut it off when I take the
engine out.

something is screwy here, I would 

. check to be sure guage works
. check to make sure you have a FI pump, sort of looks like a coil in size
on the frame rail on the left side above the axle (sort of)  Carb electric
pump is usually a square thing about 3 inches or so on a side.
. check the actual presure able to be pumped by plugging the line by the
regulator.  don't let it get too high, but at least 30-40psi should be
able to be pumped pretty quickly
