Subject: Re: [T2] Busses, Grease Monkeys, and Dreams

Let us know if you need any of the Type2 mafia to come down there and give rides to polls, stump in cemeteries, stuff ballot boxes, dig up dirt on your opponent, etc.  Sounds like a fun get-together to me.  Good luck....KR

was all that is in this title and this morning I thought about how  
far my life has spiraled since returning from the trip I took oh so  
many hundreds of years ago.

In 97 when I boarded the Mothership and headed out on my travels of  
America I felt so released from all of the minutia and now find  
myself standing in the middle of it all once again.  Sitting still  
can create such ya know.

I am actually thinking seriously about running for the Mayor of the  
small town I am from in south Georgia.  I have been asked oh so many  
times to do this by the most common of folk in this small but good  
little town.

In that past ten years my involvement, and the impact made by that  
involvment has moved me to some amount of perceived leader in some  
peoples minds, yet in my own I don't really feel I belong there.  Its  
amazing what me standing for something creates.

God I wish I had the Mothership running.  I wish I had the freedom of  
driving the open road.  I wish I had a bean burrito from Taco Del Mar  
from Freemont in Seattle.  I wish I could wake up wondering about how  
far I wanted to drive today, or whether I would at all.  I wish I  
could roll over in my bunk and drift back off for that second easy  
sleep.

I could wind this race and know how to do what it takes after  
winning.  I could create change in this sleepy little town that needs  
better governance so badly.  I know I could grow things back to where  
it is no longer biased toward color, creed, and national origin.  But  
the question remains, do I really want too?

That is one I will answer for myself in the next three days.

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings.  At least those of sleepy dreams.
