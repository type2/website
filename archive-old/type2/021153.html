Heya Robert,
Personally, I won't mess with any of the &quot;drop in&quot; replacements.  Maybe 
later on, but I would research one in detail before using it.  Most of 
them were developed in a scramble when R12 productions were cut and 
eventually discontinued.  Many of them are not &quot;approved&quot; and a lot are 
*extremely* flammable.  I forget the exact list of gases, but I believe 
I have a sheet on many of the &quot;drop ins&quot; around here somewhere.
The reason I won't is what happens if you get in a crash?  In a crash 
that would damage the AC system, I can guarantee that there would be 
some sparks!  These sparks come in contact with one of the various &quot;drop 
ins&quot; you've charged your system with, and BOOM!!  Now you not only have 
a crashed bus, but its probably engulfed in flames.  A crash that you 
could have survived quite easily, or not even have been harmed, could 
kill you just from the explosion of these gases.

I took a look at the website that you included in your message and it 
says that it is approved by the EPA for use in mobile A/C units, but I 
am uncertain on the specifics for getting a refridgerant approved.  I'll 
see if I can't dig up some of the sheets I got a while back when I went 
to get certified.  If you haven't been certified, it is a good idea to 
do so.  I know there are many &quot;at home&quot; certification courses out there, 
but laws vary by state.  Wisconsin (where I live) happens to be the most 
strict state in the country on this topic.  I had to go to a tech school 
and take a four hour class after work one night.  It was around $60 I 
believe, but work paid for it :)  Even if you don't work on A/C a lot, 
this course will get you certified to do so.  They also offer &quot;advanced&quot; 
courses most of the time.  These courses are great and offer a lot of 
information.  Check with your local tech schools for the programs they 
offer.  The main thing they want to enforce is that you *DO NOT* let 
*ANY* of these gases into the atmosphere.  R134a seems to be the most 
widely accepted refridgerant in use, but they are still uncertain if it 
has any long term affects on the atmosphere and they don't want that 
stuff let out either.

A/C work can be expensive, but really how often are you working on it?

Thoughts to ponder...

&gt; Hi Isaiah,
&gt; 
&gt; It sounds like you've done a good bit of AC work. 
&gt; There's supposed to be a drop in replacement for R12
&gt; which is called FR12 (FrigC) and made by Intercool. 
&gt; Their web site is &lt;www.igc_dot_com/intercool&gt;.  Do you
&gt; think this stuff will work as a replacement for R12? 
&gt; Permanent conversion from R12 involves adding 2 oz of
&gt; ester oil, and charging with the FR12 blend in liquid
&gt; mode.  One of the components of the blend is R134A.
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldn't mind having the compressor if it is a York
&gt; R209R (marked on a metal plate), with 4.5 inch pulley.
&gt;  Would you be willing to ship it to Virginia, if I pay
&gt; the freight?  
&gt;
