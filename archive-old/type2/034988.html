Subject: Re: Ruminations on heating a VW bus

Hmmm,

Now I haven't delved into the whole heating issue much, but here's a theory
(for all of you wonder volks to shoot down)...

The sooner you get the hot air into the vehicle, the less it would cool down
in transit (the heater hoses), no?

So, it there a reasonably hidden place in the rear part of the Bus to
redirect the heat, say, when you open the rear heater vent?
