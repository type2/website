Subject: Just finished (mostly) my paint job...


Hey Everybody...

I finally got around to painting Mimi this past weekend. I was going to wait 
until I finished up her bodywork but with a new baby screaming in my ear and 
only a carport to work in, I figured it was better to get some paint on her 
now and (hopefully) keep the rust from spreading.

Take a peek at http://www.geocities_dot_com/vw1970_driver/index.html and let me 
know what you think.

Later...

Sean,
1970 Microbus (&quot;Mimi&quot;)
