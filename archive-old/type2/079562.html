If you keep driving it with the dirty gas tank it will eventually ruin your
carb.  U should have the tank &quot;Re-Newed&quot;

Subject: [T2] how bad is a dirty gas tank?


Hello all,

Am I killing my new engine by driving it with a rusty gas tank? The fuel
filter get's cloudy after a while and I just change it.

But I am having a problem with fuel intake. When I start up  and drive, it's
fine for about a mile. Then the carberator kinda chokes and it feels like no
gas is getting in. If I rev it to high RPM's then accelerate, it takes off
fine.

So two questions:

1. Would a rusty gas tank cause the carberator to choke?
2. Is it killing my engine?

Thanks-- &gt;&gt;
