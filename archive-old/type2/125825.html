Subject: removing slider sunroof pocket

I'm not sure this will be relevant, but I just finished fixing the headliner in 
a Dodgy van.  They make this out of something like Masonite and hold it up with 
a plastic spline.  The spline ages, lets go..... sags all over the place, you 
get the picture.  I am good at screwing things up, so I screwed it up after 
placing some shims to smooth-out the inner surfaces of the internal supports. 
Then I installed some plastic battens which came from Home Depot, in the 
department where they sell latticework.  Net result fairly nice.  I didn't take 
the time to put in some better insulation, like the bubble stuff with foil 
radiation layer -- but in any case it was not a bad job, just time consuming. 
Now I need to face much the same thing in my 69 Bay, where the sunroof channels 
are suspected of being filled with leaf particles and other related organic 
junk.  

Loafer, you may know that sunroof 5buses have added support in the floor area, 
in the form of a lower pan.  I doubt that removing the sunroof stuff up top 
would make much (if any) difference...... Glenn

Subject: removing slider sunroof pocket

I figure I can gain abou 3-4&quot; of headroom. I am
planning on installing a wood headliner also. The
sunroof pocket takes up a lot of space.. anyone
ever removed one or would the pocket be additional
structural support for the hole in the roof?
Any thoughts/musings welcome. I can work around it
I suppose. the slider is no longer a slider.
