Subject: Re: Fuel Injectors....New or Rebuilt

Kenny,

I'd say it depends on the rest of the engine. Since it's freshly rebuilt and
if it is properly balanced, then get 4 new *matched* Bosch injectors from
Marren. (If it hadn't been freshly rebuilt, I'd just have replaced the
defective injector with a rebuilt one, but only if the rebuilt is a Bosch.)
A much cheaper solution and probably almost as good a solution would be your
option #4, especially if they can substitute other rebuilt injectors to give
you a matched set.

My 0 cents,

Sami

&gt; 
&gt; After having the FI in my '77 Westy gone over by a mechanic with
&gt; Bosch experience I have this information. My intake manifold boots are
&gt; leaking and the #2 injector is not injecting properly. I have the boots
&gt; ordered from West Coast Metric but I am unsure on the injector. This
&gt; motor is a fresh total rebuild and I want to do it right. Should I?:
&gt; 
&gt; 1: Replace only the # 2 injector with a new or rebuilt from NOPI / or
&gt; other....suggestions?
&gt; 2: Replace all four injectors with new ones _at_ $75.00 ea
&gt; 3: Replace all four injectors with Rebuilt ones _at_ $35.00 ea
&gt; 4: Send my injectors off to somewhere like this Marren Motor Sports to
&gt; have my originals rebuilt/flow tested/matched/etc. _at_ approx $30.00 ea
&gt; 
&gt; As I said, I want to do it right, but $ 300.00 for injectors is steep.
&gt; Is it worth it? Thanks in advance for any suggestions and/or experience.
