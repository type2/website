What's that red &quot;B&quot; dash light for again?

Brakes?

And when you press it, should it go on? like testing it? Mine doesn't go on 
when I press it.

BUT

It went on the other day, and stayed on. But while I'm press the brakes, it 
goes off.

I don't have a manual to check what the heck I should do, I just got the 
bus.

Low brake fluid?

I'm not driving the bus until I find out.
