&gt;The new front and rear bushings that look like badminton shuttlecocks SUCK!!!
&gt;The locating tab to lock them in place on the tube are all wrong. They are big
&gt;and round and don't fit in the hole.
&gt;Plus you have to R &amp; R the engine and trans to do the rear one....

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; --Travis,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Did this last week on my 76.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1. remove gearshift assembly held by two bolts on floor. take it out as an
&gt;assembly and note how it's put together so you get it back right.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 2. under bus, find point where the two shift rods (front/rear) meet each other
&gt;and are held together with a coupling/setscrew. remove safety wire on setscrew,
&gt;remove setscrew and slide coupling forward. it will take a little wiggling to
&gt;work the front rod out so you can replace the bushing. the rod is bent by design
&gt;so don't be worried if you see it's crooked.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 3. WARNING: the bentley shows the earlier bay front shift rod bushing
&gt;arrangement where apparently the bushing goes inside the shift rod (list?), the
&gt;later bushing seats in a circular hole in a piece of vertical sheet metal and
&gt;goes around the shift rod.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 4. Lube the inside of the bushing. reinstall shift rod under bus, it's really
&gt;not hard.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 5. reinstall gearshift assembly and be prepared to adjust per bentley.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Note: My front bushing was missing entirely and my shifting has been worse
&gt;since doing the procedure. I believe I may need to replace the rear bushings (2)
&gt;also. Would the list care to comment?
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt;Hello All -
&gt;&gt; &gt;I have a 79 bus.  Recently I acquired a new front shift rod bushing (a.k.a.
&gt;&gt; &gt;shift guide) to replace the mangled, sloppy-shifting-causing rubber/plastic
&gt;&gt; &gt;disc thing that is up in there now, hanging by a thread if still there at
&gt;&gt; &gt;all.  Looking at the old bushing some time ago, I assumed that a replacement
&gt;&gt; &gt;would involve just greasing up the new bushing and sliding it into the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;peace pipe&quot; end of the shift rod, working it in so that it seals correctly
&gt;&gt; &gt;into its groove.  But, someone just told me that it is much more involved
&gt;&gt; &gt;that that -- as in having to somehow loosen/disconnect the shift rod and
&gt;&gt; &gt;slide it back in order to get/fit the bushing in there.  Is this true and if
&gt;&gt; &gt;so, can someone step me through this process?  I don't want to get under
&gt;&gt; &gt;there and start unbolting rods willy-nilly without having some guidance to
&gt;&gt; &gt;work from.  Thanks for your help!
&gt;&gt; &gt;
