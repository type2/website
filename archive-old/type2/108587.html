Subject: [T2] Type IV cooling fan question


&gt; One had a cooling fan with allen head bolts (just like CV joint bolts) and
&gt; the other had 13mm head hex bolts. Which is original?

In the air-cooled Vanagon the cooling fan is held in place with hex bolts.

&gt; Also both fans fad a single vane missing. Is that a big deal (balance
&gt; wise?). .

I would say &quot;yes, it's a big deal.&quot;  If you look closely at the fans you
should find a balancing weight somewhere along the rim.  Obviously, missing
a vane is going to affect the balance.
