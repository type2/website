&gt; Valves are set correctly. Dwell is about 50 (I'll
&gt; have to check this

&gt; course). Distributor
&gt; is the CIP1 Bruck which has the part number

Not sure where you got that number from. The cip1
Bruck dist is a single vacuum unit, # 043-905-205

  VWC-043-905-205 - BRUCK GERMANY VACUUM ADVANCE
(SVDA) DISTRIBUTOR - COMPLETE - ALL BEETLE STYLE
ENGINES

 Our Price: US $99.95  

Stock Status: (Out of Stock) 
 
Product Code: VWC-043-905-205  Qty:         

 Description    
   
   
 This is a 100% new - OE Quality single vacuum advance
distributor. This distributor provides mechanic
advance along with the vacuum advance for a smooth and
reliable service. The advantage of this type of set up
over a standard 009 Bosch distributor is - NO MORE
FLAT SPOT when you take-off from a stop sign. The
combination of a new 30 or 34-PICT carburetor and our
new vacuum advance distributor will give you the
smoothes driving experience you have ever had in your
Beetle, Ghia or Bus. This distributor also works with
all 1972 and later Bus/Van 17-2000cc engines with
stock intake systems. 

This distributor WILL NOT work properly with
aftermarket carburetion systems unless a correct
vacuum port is installed into one of the carburetors.
DO NOT TRY THIS YOURSELF, only an expert with proper
experience on the brand of carburetor you have will be
able to tell you if this can be done, and how to do
this. Any engine with a large duration cam shaft will
not have sufficient vacuum at idle to make the vacuum
advance distributor work correctly.

Comes complete with cap,rotor,points and condenser.
Ready to install. Will work properly with any
13-1600cc Beetle, Bus or Ghia engine with the stock 30
or 34-PICT carburetor. If your original distributor is
dual vacuum, then you will need to cap off the vacuum
retard side, and only run the vacuum advance from the
side of the carburetor. To upgrade to Pertronix or
Compu-fire electronic ignition, see part numbers
PER-1847 or C22-21101.

 OK. First thing that's got me confused is this,
 &quot;Timing Set At:: 5deg
 ATDC w/ vacuum hose(s) connected&quot;. Almost everything
 I've read says to
 time the single vacuum advance distributor at 7.5deg
 BTDC.  I thought
 the distributors that were set at 5deg ATDC were
 usually the dual
 vacuum models.
 
 Should I throw out my assumption that this
 distributor indeed matched
 the specs of the 113905205AN and follow my gut
 instinct to set this at
 7.5deg BTDC at idle?
 
 OK. So lets say I set everything at 7.5deg BTDC at
 idle. Then I should
 get 7.5 + (22 to 25) = 29.5 - 32.5 deg BTDC at 3500
 RPM? correct? And
 my timing at WOT with the vacuum hose connected or
 disconnected should
 be about the same because I should have little
 vacuum on that vacuum
 port at WOT? Also my timing at idle should be
 roughly the same with or
 without vacuum at idle for the same reason - no
 vacuum?
 
 Also, one more thing, is 7.5 BTDC at idle roughly
 the same as setting
 my timing statically to 7.5deg BTDC? Just curious.
