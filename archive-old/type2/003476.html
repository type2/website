You could ask Ark at heaterman_at_nac_dot_net  he's helping me out with a plug for
a BN4. That's all I got.
Brian,

&gt; Anyone have a source for these?  Mine is burned out due to my own
&gt; stupidity.  The part number is Beru 195GLS.  I have a phone number for
Beru
&gt; here in the US and I will be calling them in the morning, but can anyone
&gt; save me some time and tell me where I can purchase this part or a Bosch or
&gt; other equivalent?  My poor bus needs heat!
