Subject: Re: [T2] AC in '74 Bus

Hello List,

In my automotive class, we learned that many of the
blends offered today are actually flamable and
explosive. Don't get me wrong, I like Freeze 12 better
than 134a when recharging an old system. It does cool
better. Why do mechanics and other orginizations
promote 134a? Well, it is suppose to be less harmful
to the environment if released into the atmosphere. By
regulation, a mechanic who is certified to work on a/c
must have a recovery machine for each type of
refridgerant used. Most places only have a machine for
r12 and 134a. In the same respect, it is illegal to
opean a charged system and release the freon into the
atmoshere. This means that mechanics who works with
the blends must have a seperate machine for that blend
($$$), or risk being caught releasing the blend into
the atmosphere. ($$$) Because some blends are
flamable, they can be very dangerous to work with.
Also, Freeze 12 is more expensive and not as readily
available as 134a. One other note is that if you take
a car with an old a/c system to the mechanic, he (or
she) can make much more money if they retro fit your
R12 to 134a rather than just recharging your system
with expensive Freeze 12.

Personally, I am going to take my chances with Freeze
12. What can I say? It works. (No, I will not be
letting freon into the atmosphere.) Thanks for reading
my ansewer to the question that no one asked. Please
correct, at to, or completely discount anything I have
wrote if you know better.(which is likely) I like to
learn! :)

Have a great day!

David Kelly

&gt; David,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a friend that has been in the auto A/C
&gt; business since we were
&gt; buddies in college.  Worked with him at
&gt; VPC(Volkswagen Products Corp) in
&gt; Ft. Worth.  
&gt; 
&gt; Seems like the last timethe question of which
&gt; refrigeraant to use came up, 
&gt; I called and talked to him about it.  I believe he
&gt; said the same about 
&gt; Freeze 12.
&gt; 
&gt; When it gets to be time to actually fill the system,
&gt; I will ask him again.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, dave
