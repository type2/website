Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Trouble Starting (long)

Jules,

If you can see gas going in to the intake manifold(or feel it), then you 
have gas.  The cut off valve will not keep your bus from starting, but 
will keep it from idling well(or at all).

You have spark(you said)...Looks good? or weak?

You didn't metion that you have the new oil bath cleaner on or not...

Take it off for the test if you do.

Does the engine even attempt to start?...try and just not idle? or just 
not at all?

Disconnect the fuel cut off valve from the electrical for now and see what 
happens....pump it a little and see if it starts.

Don't touch anything that you didn't change.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Late addition to my last post regarding my difficulties getting my
&gt; engine to run:
&gt; 
&gt;  I forgot to mention that the last time I had the carb out I also
&gt; replaced the fuel cutoff solenoid as it was staying open with voltage

&gt; necessary click coming from the carb - so I'm ruling the fuel cutoff
&gt; solenoid out as a the point of failure - for now.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
