&gt; I'm not sure how hot it really gets, but I'm painting up my tin (white

&gt; stuff. So I sandblasted and it's lookin' pretty good.

According to some infrared temperature measurements that Richard Atwell 
and I took on my '76 after I drove from my house in San Francisco down 
to Richard's in Cupertino (roughly 45 miles, at 68MPH -- engine was 
quite warmed up :-), you don't need high-temp paint for either the 
engine tin or the fan shroud.  You don't need high-temp for the plenum 
or intake runners, either.
