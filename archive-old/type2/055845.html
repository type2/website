Subject: Brake grease

I read not too long ago a couple posts about frozen adjusing stars.  1
reply really seemed to have a thing about grease (would I like to meet
her! ;-)) But I digress.  I've started a resurrection on a '67 Bus and
am into the WHOA part, being of the philosophy that it's cool to GO but
ya gotta WHOA too.  I reassembled front adjusters with good old never
sieze, then nipped off to NAPA for some crocus cloth to dress a burr on
the spindle,  What did I find but Brake Grease, containing Molibdium
Disulphide, Graphite, and Lithium, guaranteed to not melt or run. 
Sounds like an updated version of the brake grease Bob Hoover was
espousing in the ramblings.  So, FWIW, brake grease lives again and is
the recommended lubricant for brake component reassembly.  If I have a
bad experience with it, I'll let y'all know.
