Subject: Westy Luggage Rack Seal

Hi Folks,

The previous thread about the poptop seal on the '82 Westy reminded me of a 
poptop-related question I've been dealing with.

I replaced the 2 poptop seals on my '79 Westy last year, and was thinking 
about replacing the luggage rack seal as well.  However, when I removed the 
4 screws on the outside (2 in front, 1 on each side), the luggage rack still 
seemed to be held in place by something underneath it.

Do I need to remove the headliner to gain access to the underside of the 
luggage rack?  If so, how much of a PITA is it to do?  Finally, once I 
remove the luggage rack, is there a special seal for it, or is its seal 
similar to the poptop seal?

Thanks for any advice or suggestions.
