Subject: RE:  What model Webers?
Date: Thu, 8 Oct 1998 12:59:13 -0500 

&gt;I have a 71 bus with an 1835 GEX motor with dual Webers that 
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;How do I tell what model the carbs are? They are two barrels and 
&gt;I have a lot of problems with backfiring, I'd like to get some specs 
&gt;on how to tune them but I need to know what I've got first.  A (nonVW) 
&gt;mechanic I took it to said the carbs were too big for the engine?!? 

The model # is stamped on the outside sides of them, usually on the
outside of one of the throat castings.  My initial guess would be that
they are IDF 40's (although 44's or even 48's might have been used)
because that's the most common performance Weber carbs found on VW's.

Does the backfiring occur on accelleration (light or heavy),
deceleration, steady throttle, when cold, etc?  Different times/types of
backfiring indicates different problems.  Give us more info...

As to whether they're too big for your engine, that's a matter of
opinion (and what venturis/jets/emulsion tubes you're using).  I've been
running dual 40's on my 1700 type IV motor for 6 or 7 years and I like
them just fine.  I've been told off-and-on by various people that that's
too much carburetion for my motor too.  But I get 18.5 mpg (not great,
but close to par for a 73 Westy) and I have plenty of power.  

For the carbs to work right, is important that there be NO air leaks
around the base of the manifolds where they bolt to the heads (check for
leaks by spraying carb cleaner around the bases while the motor is
running - if the idle changes, you've found a leak).  The carbs must
also be balanced from side to side as well as from barrel to barrel.  In
order to do that, you need a carb balancing tool (I prefer the
synchrometer over the unisyn). 

Anyway, I could go on and on about this stuff, but I won't.  If you've
got some specific questions (esp. about the backfiring), post them or
mail direct to me and I'll share what knowledge I've got.
