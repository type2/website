I would suggest double clutching, especially on the down shifts.
To double clutch:  When shifting up, say from 1st to 2nd, briefly engage the clutch
while the transmission is between gears (neutral).  Just let you clutch foot come
up about 3/4 of the way while your shift lever is between 1st and 2nd.  Hold it for
maybe a second, then foot down, finish the shift into 2nd.  When down shifting,
&gt;from say 2nd to 1st, let your clutch foot come up just like you did on the upshift,
except give the engine some gas while it is between gears.  Give it just enough gas
so that it is running at the same rpms as if it were already in first.  Then finish
the shift into first.  It takes a little practice, but even a &quot;good&quot; tranny will
shift smoother when double clutched.  If you have a tach, you can note the &quot;space&quot;,
in terms of rpms between gears and match 'em up perfect every time.

&gt;  The 2L FI engine is fine but the transmission (4 speed) is not. The synchro is
&gt; so
&gt; weak you can't upshift into any gear without grinding unless you're going granny
&gt; speed and have a very light hand on the shifter. Forget downshifting. I've
&gt; adjusted the clutch and changed the trans.oil (80W Valvoline) - didn't help. A
&gt; mechanic buddy of mine, who is conversant with VW's, suggested I run ATF in place
&gt; of regular transmission oil. That sounds a little far-fetched to me.  I can't
&gt; afford to buy a new transmission right now. Should I try this experiment or does
&gt; anyone else have any advice for dealing with a weak tranny?
