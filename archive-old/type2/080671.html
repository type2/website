Hello all,
            I was riding home today and was enjoying the shifter
extension that I found under the driver seat._dot_can't believe I had not
looked under there in the 4 years that I have owned it.  Well, I noticed
that there is a lot of play with the shifter, even when it is in gear.
When in gear I can move it from side to side about 2+ inches if not
more.  I began wondering if there was a way to adjust some of this or if
perhaps a bushing had deteriorated.  So I looked under there, but don't
exactly know what to look for.  I looked at the Bentley but had a hard
time finding anything, as well as in the archives.  Can someone help me
out here?  If you need me to take a pic I can.  Is there a way that I
can take some of this play out? Thanks
