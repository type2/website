Subject: RE: [T2] very high idle problem

Does your engine produce the &quot;rubber hammer hitting concrete&quot; sound? If so,
this may be a really bad sign - rod bearing on its way out. Have someone who
knows these engines check out the sound and do not run it in the meantime.
If my hunch is right (I hope not) fatal damage to the engine could result at
almost any time.

The other (more benign) interpretation is a severe timing problem (no
advance at all or severely retarded). This would explain the poor
acceleration and flooding of the engine as soon as you touch the throttle. I
have had this happen before on a car with a frozen mechanical advance; the
engine does become noisy when you try to floor it, but it does not
accelerate (actually has most power just a tad bit above idle and bogs down
under more throttle). Check if your distributor has come lose, also make
sure that all vacuum hoses are tight.
