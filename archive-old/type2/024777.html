Hi  does anybody know if a celing mount air conditioner from an 80
Vanagon will fit in  my 68 bus?  Also can some one tell me what color
fuses i should have from left to right in the 10 fuse fuse block in my
68 bus?  All of my fuses look old so i wanted to replace them with right
color / size.
Thanks,
Jamey Gerardi
