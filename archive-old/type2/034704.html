Subject: take my vanagon--- please

I know ya'll have likely grown very tired
of me posting to get rid of this thing, but
maybe there is a newbie who needs a 81 Vangon
project?

The motor is cooked. The body needs a paintjob,
no major rust.  I payed $200 for it. I can provide
pics.
 
I also have some camper bits for it, folding seat,
fridge, rear closet.  Paid a bit more for this stuff...

The situation is that the place where I am living,
and this is stored has been sold. I have until the end
of the month to plan something and get it moved.

Keeping it isn't an option for me.

Please contact me if you are remotely interested in it,
or parts of it.  I need the space, and hopefully some
spending change to move :)

thanks for the time
