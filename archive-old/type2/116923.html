Subject: '73 Dizzy

In a quest for better performance, I replace the 009 distributor on my bus'
engine ('75 bus, '73 engine) with the correct distributor for the engine -
dual vacuum unit.  My bus does not, however, have the stock carbs.  I'm
running a single 2-barrel progressive solex.  So, I ran the vac advance tube
to the vacuum fitting on the carb (only 1 to chose from) and the retard tube
to a t fitting in the line to the brake booster.  Obviously, the retard is
not getting the correct signal (yes, the diaphragm is ok - holds a vacuum),
because I have to time it at 8 BTDC to get the proper amount of advance at
cruising speed.  Any suggestions?
