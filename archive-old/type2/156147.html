Subject: flat 4 fetish

Ok, so, I know it ain't Friday, but thought I'd share this anyway.

Goin down the road, not feelin particularly bad, and see this bus (say ~76) with a FLAT FOUR FETISH sticker on the back.  I got a hearty chuckle out of that. Also thought to myself, you know, I've got 1 vw and 2 subarus with flat 4s.  I need that sticker!!

Thought you might appreciate this sort of nonsense.  I did.  As mentioned, heartily.
