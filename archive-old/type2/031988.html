Subject: Problem w/GEX engine, and a question
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.91.990629125543.8829A-100000_at_Sherlock.SIMS.Berkeley.EDU&gt;

Hi all:

I removed my Vanagon GEX engine today and took off the head where I knew 
I had the problem.  Found that the head of the #1 cylinder exhaust valve 
had snapped off, destroyed the piston and imbedded itself in the head.  
This in a car with 28,000 easy miles, regular oil changes, functioning 
flaps and all tin.

I'll put in my spare engine tomorrow or the next day... it's getting too 
hot out there to work.

Now the question: is it tough to replace the oil seal in the 
transmission, the one that the shaft pokes through?  If it's doable by a 
driveway mechanic, I'd sure appreciate some guidance.

TIA.
