That third hole is the only way that the mustache bar is stabilized
from rotating about its long axis.  I'd suggest that it would be very
valuable to drill and tap it so that the engine can be attached
correctly.  You only have three bolts holding the entire rear of the
engine/transmission, so you really want them all present and working!

You've already spent 1000+.  I'd hate to see that investment dragging
along after your bus.  Another $20 for the tap and drill is cheap
insurance.
