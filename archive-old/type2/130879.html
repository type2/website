Subject: My first bus camping trip (EveryBus)

     Marcus said he would be sending out a full trip report with picture 
links of our fun ride home (it should have been about 5 hours but ended up 
being about 12!).  I just wanted to say that I had the best time at this 
first VW bus camping trip and met some really great people.  The whole scene 
was just pretty amazing.  There seems to be less and less people of any 
really quality out there in this world, but there were about 150 busloads of 
them in NC this weekend!
     The ride out was fairly un-eventful.  The camping trip was awesome!  
The ride home was a bit trying, but we made it.  As for bus technical 
content:
     If your pressure sender ever goes bad on the way home, you can use a 
spare brake line with Teflon tape on the threads to seal it up.  Cut one 
fitting off, plug it with something, and put a couple of hose clamps on.  
What a cool idea!  Also, you probably all know this, but make sure you check 
the brass fuel fittings that go into your carbs.  Mine popped off about 30 
miles from home and thank god it didn't catch on fire.

Special thanks to:
Marcus for allot of carb help, the brake hose idea (the new hose we 
sacrificed), and allowing me to spray the front of his bus with oil the 
whole way home.
Mayone (This is pronounced May-own-ee as best as my sloppy tongue can work 
it out, I don't know how to spell it, but this is a very patient woman and 
she has a very nice voice).
Steve Dolan for all his technical knowledge, driving around looking for 
parts, his &quot;no bus left behind&quot; mentality and general greatness.
Tommy Tarka for his unique west coast kind of &quot;it'll be okay&quot; smile and 
attitude as well as being on the parts runs and helping with my bus.  Also 
for inspiration to get the thing running and go to EB.
Mark Dearing for the nice Z-bed he sold me, and some carb adjustments.
Norton who works with Mark for putting it in.
My neighbors at EB, Steve and Leo for letting my hang out and sing some 
songs with them.
My other neighbors at EB, Josh and Tyler for chatting and chilling and just 
being good neighbors.
The whole EB crew and the people there for making sure all the problems on 
the way home are still worth it.
