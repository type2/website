Hello all.  I am a first timer using your news system.  My husband Jeff is a
subscriber, but it seems I am always the one checking the mail.  A posting
from someone else regarding electrical failure while on a trip caught my eye
as the same thing happened to Jeff while driving home from work the other
night, but only on a fifeteen minute drive.  He has purchased a new battery
but not had the chance to install it yet due to constant downpours from many
passing cold fronts (we live in Oregon, one of the rainiest states you'll
ever see).  In the occurrance that the battery is not the answer to our
problem, we are in the same boat as Brett.  Any news you might have to help
us out would be greatly appreciated.  Have a great day, whenever you may see
this!
