Subject: Timing scale

Hey Everyone,
Would anybody be willing to scan or at least photograph the timing scale on 
a 1700 type 4 motor? I've got a '73 motor with no scale and I can't seem to 
find one here in Phoenix, Az.
I think if I can get a scan or a clear photo of one, I can make a decent 
facsimile. Any other ideas?
Thanks,
Jeff
