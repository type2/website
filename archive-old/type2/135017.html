Subject: RE: [T2] Cabin Heat and 72-74 NOS

&gt; I am always careful in quoting people prices on 72-74 exhaust swap by
&gt; simply pricing the exchangers and muffler. There is also  the lower
&gt; and forward tin pieces (4), the alternator bracket the rear and front
&gt; heat  pipes (4) and the gaskets and hardware... all of these minor tin
&gt; pieces are very hard to come by and very necc.


While I did not claim that the swap was completely bolt-on (in fact I
specifically said otherwise), consider the alternative. The relatively minor
parts/work required to do the swap for once and for all is nothing compared
to the huge hassle/expense that you will go through in the long run if you
DON'T do it. It's by far the 'lesser of the two evils.'  This is not even a
close call, in my opinion.

The '75-78 setup we use here was a U.S. only setup that was only cobbled
together by VW to meet U.S. emissions standards.  For very good reason, they
did not use it in the rest of the world. It is unneccessarily complex, even
when working correctly. Those parts that are available new are expensive (if
you buy OEM quality), and many are not available new at any price - simply
because it was not economical for the manufacturers to keep them in
production given that only U.S. busses had them.  Specifically,
the two exhaust manifolds, two &quot;U&quot; pipes, and (if you use a CAT) crossover
pipe are no longer available new. These are not minor parts that can
possibly be fabricated like a piece of engine tin or a bracket. They are
absolutely critical parts that cannot be had new anymore at any price. Your
exhaust system and heat system will not work without them.  Even a minor
hole due to rust will cause a loud exhaust and state inspection failure.
They are very hard to find used, and when you do find them they are either
already halfway rusted out, or very expensive. As the used parts get older
and good ones more rare, the situation will only worsen.  I have seen people
pay hundreds of dollars for used ones in so-so condition, because they
didn't know about the '72-74 option and were stuck in a bind.

By comparison, switching to the '72-74 setup completely eliminates virtually
all of those unavailable parts, once and for all. You no longer need
manifolds or U-pipes at all; the '72-74 setup doesn't require them.  You
don't even need a crossover pipe anymore, unless you must use a CAT or EGR
filter (and even then, you can now use the readily-available '79 crossover
pipe). In exchange for getting rid of a boatload of unavailable parts
forever, all you need to do is find/modify/fabricate some much simpler parts
one time - a few pieces of engine tin, a heater tube, maybe a bracket.
Obviously finding them used is the best solution if you know of a '72-74
junkyard bus. But with a little ingenuity it's not impossible to
modify/fabricate something that will do the job, even if only to hold you
over until you find a junkyard donor. The same could not be said about the
manifolds and crossover pipes that you are eliminating. Not only are they
rare and nearly impossible to fabricate, but you will need to find them more
than once. As opposed to tin or a bracket, which can be 'rustproofed' to
last a long time, we all know that exhaust system parts rust out much more
easily. (Especially ones that were already used for ten or fifteen years
before you got them.)  Each time you need to replace one of these parts it
will be more rare, more expensive, and harder to find in good conditon than
the time before.

So what would you rather do, deal with a few minor tin/heater duct issues
one time only, or be searching for rare and expensive obsolete exhaust parts
forevermore?

As I said, there has been much written on the list about exactly what you
will need to obtain or fabricate, so anyone considering such a change can
read the archives and decide what is right for them.
