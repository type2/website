Subject: fuel filters and tin seals; also progress

Hello,  after hearing a few people talking about how
they have 2 fuel filters I have this question. why would it be
good to have more than one fuel filter? Wouldn't one filter do
the job as long as you change it often.  I know some people got
rusty gas tanks, but wouldn't that one filter get everything?

next question,
The seal that goes around my oil pressure sending switch
has broken apart in many chucks. I was thinking about
using some other plastic, but not sure what would melt.
What have you guys used for a fix, a temporary one
till you buy a new seal?

engine is about ready to go back in, got to put
on clutch and valve train parts
O yea, almost forgot to ask- I replaced
the big washer on the flywheel, the one thats between
the 5 bolts and the flywheel. The center where
the trans shaft goes through was all banged up
like the trans shaft was beating it. Is this
normal?, I went ahead and replaced the pilot bearing.
I can wiggle the trans shaft from side to side just a bit
but not a lot. Whats normal?

TIA
alex,
