Sounds kinda silly to reduce intake valve sizes when increasing engine
size but there is a reason: the Injection intake system is really
different then the carbed one. The dual carbed type IV engine has only
a short manifold and little or no ram effect. Injected type IV engines
have thouse long tube runners we all know and love. Real good ram
effect forcing air into the heads at certain speed ranges. If they had
not reduced the valve size they would have had a problem with the
engine being too eager to over rev and the associated higher temps at
the exhaust valves.

Did they stay with the same size intake valve on the latter Euro type
IV engines with single center carb and long injection style runners?
