&gt;  That mayonaise looking stuff that you find

&gt;thinking that this is most likely caused by worn rings creating blow-by. Would
&gt;this be the most common cause?

The most common cause is short run driving. Just clean it all during 
periodic maintenance.

&gt;  I have also noticed that my oil starts to smell
&gt;like gas after awhile. This would also be caused by blow-by correct?

The most common cause is short run driving. Just change the oil more often 
during periodic maintenance. Also, make sure the mixture is adjusted properly.
