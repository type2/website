Subject: Exhaust stud FART

*lights a match*

So I was over at another bus ownerr's house today and looked at his
beautiful green and white bus. But I wasn't there to drool. I needed
to see if we could get the inboard #3 exh stud out.

There's a good 3/4&quot; sticking out. He had used a SAE stud puller with
no luck. I look, see there's room to maybe get my decades old vise
grips on it. Back to the GWB and grab said tool and a can of PB
Blaster.

Soak stud and tap.
Round stud off some more because grips can't.
Soak stud and tap.
And so on.

After about 30 minutes or so of doing that the stud wasn't budging. I
left him the can and told him to go out every day and give 'er a
squirt. Oh, and put some PB on the stud as well. ;-) He really wants
to get this going NOW. Can't blame him, stuck driving a brand new
Durango. The Horror!!!!

There's been talk about heat and paraffin, but I'm having difficulty
visualizing the process. I mean, we somehow need to heat the stud, not
the head, and make the paraffin flow upwards in the process? Without
melted wax dripping on arms and eyes?

Anyway, what is the deal with so many busted exhaust studs? I know why
both his and my studs snapped. Mine because I had the long side of the
stud in the head for some idiotic reason and tried to crank the nut to
seat against the HE. The one today was from a crossed nut on the stud
and not noticing until too late.

But I've never had a busted stud of ANY KIND on any car previously
owned. I've had studs come out, but that just called for new stud with
threadlock. Non-issue.
