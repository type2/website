Subject: Any Plug Helicoil &quot;Success&quot; Stories?

Hi All,

Does anyone have any helicoil &quot;success&quot; stories with
spark plug holes?

The archives don't seem to support such an idea.

I have 2 newly rebuilt heads with a helicoil in each.
('72 1700).  I cringed when I got them back from the
machine shop  like this.  With the plug all the way in
but not yet seated, I can wiggle the boot end of the
plug a good 1/8 &quot; back and forth (sideways).  The
helicoils appear to be set solid, but diameter is a
bit wide. Plugs thread in normally but rattle
somewhat.

Should a helicoil be this loose (oversized)? 
The archives seem to indicate that even a &quot;good&quot;
helicoil is a bad thing. I plan to travel to Mexico or
Alaska this summer.  

I'm considering timeserts, but having trouble finding
a shop with the insert kit

Thanks
