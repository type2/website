Subject: Type 2 Site/BA6 Docs

Hey, I noticed the BA6 manual is missing from the Type 2 website (Library).
Looks like it pointed to Thom's Vintagebus site, but the images are not there.

Does anyone have a manual or copy they could sell me? I just bought a BA6
and I need some documentation so I can start the brainwork to get it into
the bus.

FYI, the heater I bought is materially complete, but missing some ducting.
I do have the timer switch and some other switch/trip switch.

Thanks! Joe
