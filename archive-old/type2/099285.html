Subject: Re: [T2] Pushrod tube removal

The tubes can stick when you try to pull them out, especially if somone
used some sort of sealer in a past install.  There is not much gripping
room, and resist the urge to use a plier if you want to reuse them. 
Clean oily tubes real well (Gumout works well) in the center 3&quot;.  See if
you can turn any by hand, and if so, twist them out; you'll have more
room to grip adjacent sticky tubes. I've had good luck wrapping
reinforced strapping tape around the tube center and then yanking on the
tape to get it going.  I suppose one could try a small strap wrench also
and yank sideways on it.  If you can find a perfectly fitting &quot;core
tube&quot; that fits in the tube, push that in and then use a grip plier.  
   You can use a puller that expands internally, much like the bicycle
handlebar stem that has a threaded wedge pulled up into the puller as
you tighten the long bolt at the end.  I envision using a piece of pipe
that just fits into the pushrod tube.  Cut on a steep diagonal to
produce a wedge end.  Use a piece of allthread or very long bolt to hold
the 2 pieces together.  Figure a way to prevent the nut at the wedge end
from spinning, like weld/epoxy it to the end.  Insert, and tighten the
exposed nut or hex head.
