Forget the gloves. If you get zapped by touching the wires on a standard
point type system the wires are shot. Just confirm the coverings are supple
and clean, confirm the resistance with a good brand name digital
multimeter, both the wire and the insulator resistance. If over spec,
replace the set. Confirm spark energy from coil to ground. This confirms
points/condenser function as well as coil. Do confirm security of terminals
at the coil. Confirm spark energy from cap to ground. Fix cap/rotor problem
if poor. Measure spark gaps. If worn over 0.1 mm from spec, replace set.

See archive reference for info on multimeters before you buy this essential
tool.
