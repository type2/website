Subject: Re: [T2] gas tank sending unit

These usually don't cost so much money, and I would replace it on general
principle. It's so much work to pull the engine and tank.. why not do it now
while you have everything apart and you can still get the sender? I think
they only cost about $25. I'd say it's well worth it.. then keep the one you
have as a spare, in case you need one later and cannot get it.
Don't neglect to replace the rubber connecting hoses on the crossover tank
ventilation system.. the yellow resin rods and steel tubing system above the
tank and engine. All should be replaced with braided FUEL hose only. and
there is a sneaky one up in the vent area above where the spare tire goes.
You can't see it but you can feel it if you reach up there.
I would just rather do this stuff when you have the engine out and then
enjoy a reliable, trouble-free ride for years.
And I just DID all of this with my '78, plus I replaced the rubber fill tube
&quot;neck&quot; boots. I had to heat up the tank-to-neck boot with a rag and hot
water to get it to slide on good. They are a very expensive dealer item
(about $90), but you can get an identical hose, cut to fit at a NAPA dealer
for about $15.
I found that my sending unit had elements missing on the fiber board that's
inside the sending unit.. where the moving contact rides over. Consequently
there were &quot;dead zones&quot; where it send no values at all to the guage. Someone
had done the same thing to my bus, cutting open the firewall into the
passenger area.. Well, I guess that will tell you that we're not the only
lazy people out there! LOL. To me, that is not much of a mechanic, though.
That firewall is there for a reason.
