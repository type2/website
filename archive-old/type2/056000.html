Subject: Bus handling/steering feel: update.

Hi volks,
           I posted recently (must have been a month back) about improving the steering feel of my '77 and whether the light and rather loose feel of the steering was just a bus characteristic. I should have known the answer as I've driven enough of the things! Still, nice to get a wider view: it's always worth soliciting opinion, especially from such a learned group.
 I got several answers- check tyres, alignment, steering damper etc. and have gone through these to varying degrees. What I found is:

 -No apparent play in front end.
 -Steering damper seems OK.
 -Alignment work for a bus is expensive here (I passed, pending further investigation).
 -One of my rear tyres was &quot;reinforced&quot; but not LT-Load range C rated (only 40psi max) whereas all the others are 6 or 8-ply.
 -My tyre pressures were wierd.

 I blame the DPO for the cheap tyre (and myself for not checking it properly when I took ownership). I assume a momentary lapse of reason on my part accounts for the pressure lunacy (though I'd like to blame a forecourt pressure guage, if that's OK with you :-).

 I have since received a set of 22mm (7/8&quot;) anti-roll bars and a brand new LT-8PR tyre from Bob Wallace (Thanks Bob) and have fitted  all three. Experience so far points to a major improvement in stability and much more comfortable cornering.

 As well as a general improvement in driving quality I have been aiming to improve the bus to the level where I would feel comfortable putting a 911 engine into it. I feel I've got to that stage, now, with the following maintenance and updates over the past year or so:

 New front brake discs + pads
 New rear shoes + wheel-cylinder
 KYB Gas-A-Just Shocks 
       (good &quot;sporty&quot; shocks but beware of rough ride)
 22mm Anti-roll bars.

 I had wondered if I would need to lower the bus to reduce the roll moment: I don't currently feel that's necessary but may come back to it later.
 I still plan to fit 15&quot; alloys at some point so I can run &quot;performance&quot; tyres- 215/65R15 tyres designed for luxury saloons and estates seem like a good bet- there's quite a range available with good loading and speed specs that should have good sidewall stiffness and be much stickier (at least on dry roads). These have near-stock diameter according to my calculations and should fit the wheel-wells.

 Next stage is to finish researching my engine/gearbox options (ref. earlier post regarding UK sources). I will need to deal with a few other issues before I start turning spanners- immediately presenting themselves are (1)pay off other car and (2)find garage to carry out work in. Hopefully I can find the parts I need along the way.
 So far so good. I hope I can make this happen :-).

Cheers,
         W.
