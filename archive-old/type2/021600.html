Hey George Lyle, this is one for you!
Now at nearly 227,000 miles, my ORIGINAL 78 engine is still putting,
although losing a bit of oil (not burning).  I got it at 60K and it ran
for about 100k with no thermostat (wire off) before I finally went to
the trouble of fixing it after reading about the need for the flaps to
be closed until warmup (having joined this list around when it started.
It's been a daily driver as well as used for trips.  Go figure.   I
question whether the flaps allow more &quot;uniform expansion&quot;; they allow it
to get to endstage faster, yes, but blocking air to the heads/cylinders
should't change the relative rate difference of expansion?

metals of cast iron and aluminum to achieve relatively uniform expansion
rates during warm-up so case to cylinder/cylinder to head leaks are
minimized.

It's all about that first ten minutes if you want your engine to
laaaaaast.
