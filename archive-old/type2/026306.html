	[Crick, Bill [KAN:0W40-M:EXCH]]  Various people sed (The list won't
let me reply for some reason? Maybe its a hint):
&gt; In conclusion, GET GAUGES!  With oil temp and cylinder head temp gauges
&gt; you can drive around without the flaps and not worry too much because
&gt; you will be able to monitor the temperature of the oil and cylinders and
&gt; shut the engine down before it becomes a problem. 
&gt;  Hmmm, I think I would prefer having the flaps to having the gauges~
	[Crick, Bill [KAN:0W40-M:EXCH]]  So someone sed:
&gt; Not me!  Gauges are pretty much mandatory on my vehicles. And, while
&gt; the flaps are still in my T4 engine, there is no thermostat, and I always
&gt; tore
&gt; the flaps out of T1's. I never drive off before my Cyl.Head Temp gauge
&gt; reads
&gt; 100 anyway, and the slight extra warmup time is irrelevant. Of course,
&gt; since I
&gt; don't have an engine seal either, my engine probably warms up faster than
&gt; most
&gt; sitting at idle.   8-)
&gt;          If you love your bus -- get at least a oil tem and oil pressure
&gt; gauge.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
	[Crick, Bill [KAN:0W40-M:EXCH]]  And so I say:
	I disagree. Why go into manual temperture control? That went out in
about 1910?
	VW believed that the VW engine with flaps and a thermostat, and no
gauges
	 was capable of running from Siberia, to the Sahara and the cooling
system was automatic. 
	In fact they did get some real lab testing neat near the middle of
the century.
	If I had to monitor a temperature gauge, and adjust my driving to
control the temp,
	and possibly stop to let it cool off if it got too hot, I wouldn't
have the vehicle. I'd trade
	it in on a more modern early 1900's Ford model T, or A. 

	Jeez
