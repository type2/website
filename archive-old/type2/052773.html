Hiya Rob,

As an old National Guardsman I might have a tip for you.  EVERY piece of 
military equipment has it's corresponding handbook.  Your M978 will be no 
exception.  And these handbooks go into EXTREME detail.  
So, here's what I would do were I you...........try explaining your problem 
to the sergeant at the local Armory motor pool.  Often, the Motor Pool 
Sergeant is a full time Guard employee and can be found at the Armory during 
the week.  The older this guy is, the better.  Let him know what it is you 
need and be sure to have the nomenclature (name - military designation, 
etc.). Better yet, take the thing is so he can examine it.  
If he's not around, settle for the company clerk or the First sergeant.  
These two will know the contents of their Armory library.  
If you dead-end at this point and cannot find the handbook, try the nearest 
large active Army facility.  They will have a large &quot;lending library&quot; of 
materials which they loan out to smaller units.

Good luck
