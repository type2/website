Subject: Fw: [T2] Re: [VB] Is there a min air flow for heat exchangers?

[...]

I can't recall the name of the outfit [based in Arizona, I think] that makes
the full air recirculation kits for buses and bugs advertised in the VW
magazines.

The diagrams in their ads show the &quot;intake&quot; hoses from the vehicle interior
to the heat exchangers as completely bypassing the fan shroud on upright
[Type 1] engines.

I don't know how they deal with the problem of maintaining air flow through
the HEs when the heating system is not in use and the valves are closed.
The upright engine system has wastegates at the heat exchanger outlets to
dump &quot;warm&quot; air when the heater valves are closed.  The electric booster
fan(s) could be wired to run all the time, with heat output to the bus
interior controlled solely by the dash levers and HE output air valves, but
that would prematurely wear the blower motors and draw a lot of precious
juice.

Anyone have experience with these kits, or know what they do to prevent
overheated HEs?

&gt;&gt;  Thanks to Sean, Scott, and Ted for disabusing me of the idea (T4 assist
blower as main heater blower) on other grounds.  Sounds like an inline
meltable bilge blower under the front floor is a better solution.  &lt;&lt;
