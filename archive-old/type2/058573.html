dear knowledgable person
i have a question regarding the swap of my 64 delux front end to a 71
bus front end.  I read in a vw book that it was a simple bolt on
conversion and it was the easiest and cheepest way to get a set of
disc brakes for my bus.  is this true. i have a feeling it will be
harder than that.  if you have any knowledge on the subject or know
anyone who has done the conversion please let me know.  i don't want
to shell out big bucks for the conversion kits available, but don't
want to get into something too elaborate.  I just want my brakes.
thanks
evan stanley
