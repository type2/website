Subject: Hot engine, redux

You might recall a message I sent a few weeks ago, in which I 
mentioned a problem with the engine of my '71 not starting 
after it got hot, then stopped...

I replaced the fuel filter, and the lines leading to and from
the filter, and it seems to have taken care of the problem.
However, the weather also cooled down somewhat, so it's 
possible that the engine is being cooled just enough to 
prevent the vapor lock from happening, and rather than being 
fixed, the problem is merely postponed.  

I'd posited a question:  how to determine if then engine is,
in fact, running hot.  It was suggested that I get an oil
temperature gauge.  I'm looking right now - anyone have any 
good/bad stories to tell about suppliers and manufacturers?

By the way, the moderator posted a response saying, in essence,
that temperature gauges aren't particularly useful, because
they tell you if the engine is running hot, but don't 
actually *do* anything about it. 

I agree, but it's impossible to fix a problem if you can't
determine whether or not it exists.  I'd like to diagnose
before I begin to repair, y'know?  And the &quot;is the dipstick
too hot to touch&quot; method is a little too imprecise for my
tastes.  

So what sort of temperature gauge to get?  How easy are 
they to install?  How easy are they to uninstall, as I
might try using it on my Ghia, if it becomes necessary...

TIA
