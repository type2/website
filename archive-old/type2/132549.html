That attitude gets you thrown out of Olympic competition.

I think Clara explained it best: if you are going to increase 
horsepower by any _meaningful_ percentage, you'd better make comparable 
improvements to braking, steering, and suspension. It would make more 
sense to stitch a bus body onto a D*dge Hemi chassis.

On the other hand, if all you mean is that you like the idea of keeping 
a bus optimally tuned so as to maximize its stock performance, we have 
no argument.
