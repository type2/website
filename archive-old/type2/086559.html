ok, since the last 2 messages went no where,  I think I must have quoted =
too much... sorry!  Anyway, in answer to my last inquiry, somebody, I thi=
nk Eron, said that they experienced this in a 70 bug.  Yes, my pressure p=
late is probably the wrong one.  Is it possible to change out something r=
ather than the pressure plate?  Pressure plate is new, and I would hate t=
o get rid of it.  Is there something I can modify so this plate will fit?=
