Subject: stubborn doors

I have been trying (unsuccessfully) to get the doors off my 70 Westy and 
I am at my wit's end.  What do you do when heat, lubrication, and 
excessive force won't do anything but spin the head right off the bolts?  
I would like to avoid drilling them out if I could.

On the happy side:  After taking my time and gradually working on getting 
this think road-worthy, last night I tried to tow it from my friend's 
garage to my house with my dad's truck.  Sadly, we couldn't do it because 
the brake lights and the flashers don't work and I'm not that 
adventurous.  BUT...I drove her for the first time and it was 
wonderful! :) :) :) :) :) :)
