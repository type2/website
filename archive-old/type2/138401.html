Subject: Two notes on engine work

Note #1: Award for worst designed tool available to amateur mechanics:

And the award goes to -- snap ring pliers. Professional mechanics have 
turbo air-powered snap ring removers that just suck the ring out of its 
place and preserve it in a baggy. Not us. We have to use a tool that's 
really not much more effective that using the ends of two nails. Takes 
the same amount of patience.


Note #2: Why it takes amateur mechanics so long to get work done:

Go to the VW parts counter. Pick up envelope with three shims. Bring 
them home; try a stack of all three. Too much. Take one of the new ones 
off shaft and put the old one on. Too much. Take the old one off. Two 
look just right. Go off and find feeler gauges. Yes, just right. Turn 
to put the remaining two shims in the envelope. Only find one. Decided 
that the missing shim might be in a very bad place. Search for 45 
minutes without luck. Go inside and write an e-mail to type 2 list that 
no one wants to read and every sensible person will delete. Come to the 
end of that e-mail, breathe deeply, and go back out to the garage to 
resume this stupid search.
