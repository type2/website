Subject: Mexican bus sighting

Message-Id: &lt;&quot;981205034327Z.WT22853. 36*/PN=Brian.S.Hoare/OU=C367320/OU=SLLN/O=McDonnell Douglas/PRMD=MDC/ADMD=TELEMAIL/C=US/&quot;_at_MHS&gt;

While in Yuma AZ this week, I saw one of those Mexican loafs
with a radiator in the front. It had Baja plates. Also noted that an
air scoop had been put on the rear side (looked like an aftermarket
addition). I wonder if this means the watercooled still run hot, or
else this bus had been converted back to an aircooled engine.
