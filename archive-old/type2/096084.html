&gt; First, get copies of the type 2 official VW service manuals for your model, 
&gt; about $35,  and get a copy of how to keep your VW alive.. about $20. From 
&gt; The Parts Place or Amizon_dot_com.

also the AIRS list and the state maps of every state you are going
through, they usually list all the state parks and their facilities, also
helps to figure out where you are and are going

&gt; Study the books while living totally in your bus for at least two weeks 
&gt; before you get very far from home base. You will discover what you have and 
&gt; what you don't have.

excellent advice, try your hand at roaming between 3 or 4 nearby state
parks, gives you some practice setting up and tearing down camp, what
works and what &quot;well it was a good idea&quot;

&gt; You might want to make insect screens for the windows, and use strings of 
&gt; flat refrigerator magnets to hold them in place against the window frames. 

I have rolls of magnet material, can be gotten cheap at a sign makers

&gt; poles and tiedowns and stakes, to use as an awning. And several good 

a good idea is a roll awning that can be mounted to the rain gutter on the
sliding door side

&gt; flashlights.

install a cigerette lighter and get a flashlight that uses batteries that
can be charged from the lighter, also maybe a cup of water heater and a
light that will also work from the lighter outlet.  (use while engine is
running)

also a good idea to have either a oil presure or oil temp guage (both are
better)

&gt; Don't even think about a cross country trip unless you already have the 
&gt; correct tires at the proper pressure. Hard to find right tires on the road. 

and a good spare that you are willing to drive 1,000 miles or more
on.  also a hydraulic jack 

&gt; Fix your exhaust system so it lasts the whole trip. Not every town can deal 
&gt; with a 1974 VW Bus exhaust system failure. Make sure the brakes are in very 
&gt; good shape,

and take spare front brake pads, anyone can install em but not always get
em.

&gt; and see that the steering box won't break and your front beam 

very good point, mine almost failed on me

&gt; is solid....they tend to have internal rust. Put on some new wiper blades.

and some fuses

&gt; Others who travel for extended periods carry some spare parts for their 
&gt; vehicle, and enough money to get put up at a motel for a week, and towed 
&gt; and fixed at least once....maybe $500. Might throw in another $500 to take 
&gt; care of medical emergencies. I carry metal foil-faced duct tape to seal up 
&gt; unexpected openings, such as windows that won't roll up, or holes in glass 

I like that foil tape but don't forget the old standbys,  duct tape and
WD40

good luck and have a great trip
