According to her she was caught up as of May 1st. I recently gave her back
my single cab tilt canvas. (which was very nice, but shrinks like sh!t in
the rain *doh!* be sure to waterproof it BEFORE using it :)  She had made a
piece wrong, but she took it back no prob and said shed be done with it at
the end of this week.

remember
&gt;her having some marital strife last year and it affected her business
&gt;organization
