&quot;Why would VW have decided to reduce the 
size of the intake valve head between the 1800 and the 2000?&quot; 

The answer Joe is fairly simple - increased exhaust emissions.  All auto manufacturers were doing the low-tech emissions compliance dance in the '70s (VW still doesn't have a 4-valve/cylinder in anything other than the GTI - Toyota has had this technology in all plain-Jane sedans since the '80s).  This increase in engine breathing (despite emissions) is one of the reasons the '78 2L engine is preferred for the Bus.
