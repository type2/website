Subject: Re: [T2] rust behind drivers seat


In a message dated 6/14/02 8:51:32 AM, daniel_curran_at_tys.on_dot_ca writes:

&lt;&lt; From a safety perspective, do I need to be concerned about the rusting and

heavy flaking behind both driver and passenger seats, as it is near and

around the seatbelt mounting points? I have examined the seatbelt mounting

bracket under the wheelwell and it appears to be secure. How does moisture

get  in behind the seats? From weeping through the door seals? Is this a

common problem? 


Thanks

Check the seams in the sheet metal in that area; especially underneath in the 
wheel wells. Water is constantly being thrown against that area by the tires. 
Winter driving usually adds salt to the equation, depending on your area.
