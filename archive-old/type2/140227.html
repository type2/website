Subject: Mechanical Fuel Pump '73 Bus - 3 fittings?

Hi,





I am trying to replace my fuel pump on my '73 bus w/ single carb.  My old
pump appears to have qty two (2) hose fittings, however the replacement pump
has qty three (3)hose  fittings.  Can someone please tell me what the third
'skinny' fitting is for?  Did I purchase the wrong pump?





Thanks,

Shawn
