Hello,
I remember going to the webber carbs web site before, but of course i can't
seem to find it anymore.  I'm trying to figure out a way to get a auto-choke
into my '72 westy's 1700 dual carb engine, because now it has dual webber
carbs w/o any choke, and I'll need one this winter, and I really don't want to
have to spend $500 on two new carbs, and just toss the nice performance
webbers.
Thanks for any help,
Shawn
