Subject: [T2] Re: No More Leaks

     I know it's possible. My 1700 is almost leak free. A little wetness(no
drips) at one of my
pushrod tube seals at the head but thats it. My VW doesn't mark it's spot
with oil:)
Re leaks. I noticed a drop of fuel hanging from the plastic filter i have
inline to the gas heater today
so i replaced it and the engines filter just to be safe.
