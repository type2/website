&gt; ...I bent the handle on a 3/4&quot; breaker bar EVEN after

&gt; 	The carriers were ultimately dislodged from the spring plates, and
&gt; bolted up a mill in F.M.S. (tm) and slots were milled down through the nuts
&gt; in the direction of the stub shaft threads to within a &quot;very short distance&quot;
&gt; of the threads.  A chisel and a delicate tap with the BFH provided the
&gt; necessary stress relief on the mangled remains of the nut.

The poor man's version of this is to use a few abrasive cutoff wheels in a
Dremel to cut most of the way through the nut while carefully avoiding
the drum and axle threads.  Support the bottom of the nut on a jack stand
while having another stand just a hair below the torsion housing to take
the load if the first jack stand shifts.  Take a thin chisel and put it in
the slot you cut with the dremel.  Whack the chisel with a substantial
hammer.  The nut will either split in half cleanly or will expand to the
point where it will be removable.

This method takes some time, but it will get the nut off.

Remember anti-sieze on the new nut and splines!
