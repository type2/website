&gt;does anyone know where to get a complete wiring harness for a '72
&gt;microbus with a 1700 pancake? (engine caught fire- carb melted!)  
&gt;I have looked for weeks and can't find a company that carries one!

I believe the dealership still has this available.  There are two different
harness for '72, so you will need your VIN to order.  I seem to remember
one is about $50 and the other one about $80.
