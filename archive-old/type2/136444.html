Subject: Re: [T2] Valve questions.........

not that it is anything about the valves::::: but once my carb manifold came loose and on the side it came loose it was chirping just like a bird just LIKE a bird. sounded like a squeek when it idled low and then a fast chirp when high.
good luck to you either way or for whatever it is or may be?
peace and love
chris

&gt;...If I disconnect the distributor, so no spark will be produced, and it 
&gt;wouldn't start, it gives off a squeak whenever the valve moves. Squeak is the 
&gt;best word I can use to describe it. Chirp might be another. It is definitely 
&gt;more than a click of loose valves that need adjustment.
&gt; 
&gt;Any thoughts anyone?

I realize I am &quot;ringing in late&quot; here, but what the heck. Jeremy, have
you preformed a compression test lately? If so, was the squeaking
side compression low compared to the quiet side of the engine?
Try a valve adjustment (even hydraulic lifter engines need a valve
adjustment occaisionally) and retest the compression.

I heard the squeak/cricket chirp coming from my engine in '87,
and the noise was from compression leaking out between the
cylinder and head.
