&gt; Daryl,
&gt; Not to belabor the obvious, but did you check the sqaure head set screw in 
&gt; the collar that couples the front shift rod to the back shift rod? If that 
&gt; loosens, you'ld experience a mushy shift pattern.
&gt; Roland Finston

--&gt; Check the collar itself, too.  I've had the welds that hold it to the
square part break and let it rotate more or less freely.  These problems
are easiest to spot if you lay under the van and watch the coupling while
someone runs the shifter through the gears.
