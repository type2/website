&lt;&lt; is there any reason why a mechanical fuel pump (other than push starting) 
would be better than an electric pump?  &gt;&gt;

Electric fuel pumps:  
require additional wiring; require the addition of a control relay off of the 
oil pressure switch or coil; should be installed with an inertial/gravity 
safety switch; frequently require the addtion of a pressure regulatar to maintain 
fuel pressure at around 3.5 PSI; are often noisy; often fail without warning 
leaving you stranded.

in short.... more complexity, connections, components, and eventual problems.
