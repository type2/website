Dave,

With all do respect, and I do mean respect, to all my other fellow VW
enthusiasts of this net, I really don't think the Type2 net is an official
place to discuss how much output power as an amateur radio operator you can
put out.  Nor can I concur on your discussion of what bands you can &quot;Zap&quot;
those nasty old and mean bad drivers that treat you and your 1600cc without
respect.  I have worked in both commercial and military communications for
over 40 years.  I am also an amateur radio operator.  I also have over 7,000
flying hours on Rescue aircraft as a communicator.  I, like yourself get
really upset with those &quot;idiots&quot; that like to run right up to my back door
of my 79 Loaf when I am in first gear and I can't do anything about it.
Bottom line Dave, leave amateur radio were it belongs, and leave the VW
enthusiasts to VW business.  Both are professional and are two different
categories of discussion.

73,

Bill Kratch
