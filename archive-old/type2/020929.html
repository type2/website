Subject: Help-78 flywheel/crank o-ring spec...

Help- the oring I thought I had for my 78 flywheel is too large, and
even though I will try to check catalog sites, busdepot won't open for 3
hrs so I was hoping I could get either the specs (thickness diameter,
flywheel groove diameter) for the oring (I don't have the flywheel
wherfe I am) and/or the VW part number in the chance a local FLAPS could
match it up- ie is it used in Porsches, or other vw's, and might any
local hardware store have it?  Not sure if I can get transportation
anyway to BUSDEPOT, may be limited to my bicycle to a FLAPS later today
or the VW dealership about 8 mi from me.
And I gotta get this engine in tomorrow, the only day a friend can help
me......
