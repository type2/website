Don is quite a character.  When he was on the Type 3 Ghia elist his emails
regularly ranged from adoration to 'I'm getting screwed' by his
mechanic/bodyman.  I'd bet that there is more to meets the eye to this and
the body is probably safely tucked away waiting for Don to cool down from
his latest outburst.

Charles Boucher, who was supposedly restoring my Hebmüller #6, the oldest in

North America, has lost the body to my car. He now will not return my calls.

If anyone knows the whereabouts of body #6, please contact Don Garies at 
dgaries808_at_aol_dot_com. Thanx.
