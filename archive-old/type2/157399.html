Subject: Re: [T2] '72 Weekender for sale

I worked on the project.  I was an engineering aide when I was in  college in the early '80s.  They didn't have any VW busses at that  time but had quite a few electric Rabbits.  My job was to drive  them around the test track and see how many miles we got out of a  charge.  Gravy work.  The company that bought the place now  runs the electric busses downtown.  They're free. People come from  all over the world to check out the project.   Still don't recall  any VW busses but I left for Texas in '86.  I gained a great deal  of respect for some of the German engineers that came to visit.   Smart guys!  Didn't speak much English and I don't speak German  but they really knew how to solve problems.   Shortly after  that I bought a brand new GTI. Those were the days.   Cheers...KR
