Subject: Re: [T2] URGENT: drying the air-oil filter

--- tank &lt;bedhead_at_pacbell_dot_net&gt; wrote:&gt; 
&gt;  What are the risks of not
&gt; drying it thoroughly and hooking it up long enough
&gt; to move it from my
&gt; driveway to the curb across the street? &lt;&lt;

For that short of time, just move it without the
filter in place (just make sure there is nothing
flying around loose in the engine compartment that
could theoretically get sucked down in there. NOT
LIKELY in such a short time, but possible.)
