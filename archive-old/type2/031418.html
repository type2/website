&gt; My old one has a &quot;switch&quot; that is engaged by a spring on the bottom of

yes it is the kick down switch

&gt; wiring diagrams.  When I ordered the pedal (Bus Depot) I didn't see a 
&gt; different listing for automatic trans.

it is in a suplement in the auto tranny section of Bentley, but it goes to
a terminal on the side of the auto tranny (this is ONLY on the early
vacuum shift auto tranny, the later trannies have a different kick down
mech)

&gt; I have a 1975 Westy (auto tranny) with a 1978 engine that was converted 
&gt; from FI to single carb.  Do I still need this switch?  Should I drill out 

you only need the switch if you still want passing gear to work, as far as
I know they are NLA so you will have to make the switch

&gt; the holes needed in the new one?  Do these pants make me look fat?

sure drill out the holes
and the pants look fine but there is a grease stain on em from working on
your van on the way over
