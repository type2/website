OK, I finally got the Terrpin Flyer started last month. Was waiting for a muffler and now I have it (thanks again, Nikki!) got it on and all that good stuff. After unsticking my rear right brake and charging the battery, I got the bus started this afternoon on my lunch hour, but now I have a problem. When the shift knob is in neutral, the right rear tire is spinning (still up on jack stands).  All attempts to put the bus in gear fail and I have no motion in the left rear wheel. I'm thinking shift linkage. Any suggestions?

TIA
