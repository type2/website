I agree, and as one of the admins I would love to make it an official
kill.  

Unfortunately, since this issue affects the list as a whole I am
very hesitant to make it official, since then I would be forced to take
action against people who would strongly protest that I zapped them for
having the wrong opinion.  This is something I won't do.

It does look as if the archives will be back.  There are a number of
issues of importance on the admin front, and the archive problem adds to
the pile for the tech guys.  The issue of publishing is dead, as all
parties have agreed that it won't be published.

We will work through this, but remember that nobody is getting paid and
therefore listee demands that &quot;something be done&quot; may well result in key
persons deciding that their time would be better spent on a beach on
Cozumel than fixing list problems for free.  The message is, be thankful
for the excellent list we have and be patient for the restoration of
features.
