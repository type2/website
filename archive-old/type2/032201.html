&gt; Dear list,
&gt;             This one's got me stumped. Maybe you can help.
&gt; I'm driving my '78 2.0L  FI camper along the freeway for about five
&gt; minutes, it wasn't even up to operating temp. Suddenly it starts bucking
&gt; and losing power. I manage to get it to an off ramp and pull into an
&gt; AM/PM where I can't restart it. I go around the back to check things out
&gt; and the catalytic converter is glowing red! Not a minute later a
&gt; fire-truck pulls in saying someone had reported a car with flames coming
&gt; out the tail-pipe. Since nothing seemed to be currently burning I told
&gt; them it was OK and got the beast towed home.

--&gt; Well, among other things, if you were misfiring on one or more
cylinders (bad spark plug wire, perhaps?  Bad points?  Some other ignition
problem?) you'd have a lot of unburned fuel going out the exhaust.  This
would probably burn in the converter and result in exactly what you had
happen. 

I suspect the reason your van bucked and stalled is that the overheated
innards of the converter collapsed and plugged off the exhaust.  If this
is the case, reinstalling it would be, obviously, inadvisable.
