Subject: Re: [T2] flame vs. heat switch

ours has to 'see' the flame, if it can't it shuts the oil off. Of course
there's always the wood stove.

&gt; &gt; Guys, what exactly is the flame/heat switch? Are we talking about a
sensing/detector type device?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; yeah, no flame causes fuel to shut off.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The reason I asked is because someone suggested substituting a thermal
(I assume meaning &quot;heat&quot;) switch in leiu of the flame switch. What I can
tell you from doing fire protection for a living is that flame detectors are
used in very sensitive situations (around generators/open flame) and are
high speed detectors.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; substituting a thermal switch (read: slower) may not be a good
engineering decision when you're talking about personal safety with these
heaters.
&gt;
&gt; actually I think the heaters use a thermal switch, the flame switch would
&gt; be an upgrade to a more sensitive device, therefore in theory more safe
