Subject: Re: [T2] MPG Westys

Good lord, not that much. I have a 76 westy, 2l with hydro lifters (yes, it 
didn't come that way) and barely pull in around 17 MPG. Only time I saw more 
than that was going through the Mohave desert at a steady 50-55 when I 
finally saw about 21. I just burn up a lot of gas at anything over 55, 
especially 65.

What speed are you averaging when you get this kind og mileage?

&gt;Several people aked about the mileage I am getting
&gt;with the ICT's I just installed.I saw a 4 mpg
&gt;improvement on average over theProgressive Weber.
&gt;I was getting about 11 mpg in town, went up to 15
&gt;immediately.I got 18.5 on the road this weekend, never
&gt;saw betterthan 15 before.
&gt;************************************************
&gt;
&gt;Lat week we took our 79 Westy fully loaded with three
&gt;people and two dogs with camping gear for five days
&gt;and a car top carrier/box mounted on the pop top and I
&gt;averaged 22.4 MPG. Stock 2L hydro lifters and fuel
&gt;injection.
&gt;What are other late westy's getting on mpg ?
