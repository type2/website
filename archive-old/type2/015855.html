&gt;do i have a cat????

VW did not put a catalytic converter on a 72 bus.  My guess is that someone
put in sun visors from a later model bus when yours rotted out.  Another
possibility is that someone retrofitted a catalytic converter onto your bus
(possibly including a later model engine?) and was thorough enough to put
in the later model sun visors too.
