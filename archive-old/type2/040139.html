I do a lot of short hops around the city and it taxes the electrical
system, (several times a month though I have to drive over 100 miles on
the interstate so keeps the engine blown clean, I hope) so I have two 100
amp hour batteries in parallel in my bus.

To lighten the load I also have a ten amp charger more or less permanently
attached to the battery terminals and once a week or so I plug it in
overnight (it is an automatic charger and shuts off appropriately).  In
the winter I have a dipstick heater too, just to take the load off
starting/charging system.

  In many years it doesn't seem to have had any effect on the electrical
system.  Once when desperate I jump started her with a friends power
wheelchair (amazing how much power they have, he said he didn't even
notice it on his range) still get kidded about that one, won't leave the
lights on while at a party anymore though!
