&lt;analysis of worn valve guides possibly leading to engine failure
snipped&gt;

&gt; My questions:
&gt; 
&gt; Is this plausible, or is it just the flashbacks that they promised me?

Sounds plausible to me.  Certainly worth doing some testing if you
have a suitably-worn engine.

&gt; If it is, is there a way to test pressure in the crank case?
&gt;   (I know that there is *some* pressure there, from an attempt to
remove
&gt;    the oil filler cap while the engine is running :-)

Simple!  Just install a schrader valve stem where you want to measure
pressure.  Drill a hole, get one of those nice metal valve stems (they
even come with an elbow if you need one for clearance) and install the
valve stem.  I'd probably start with the oil fill cap and then put one
on one of the valve covers.  Take the pressure reading with a normal
tire gauge.  One that holds the highest pressure would be nice.

One caution:  The rubber in the sealing washer on the valve stem may
not be up to service in hot oil.  You might want to replace it if you
are going to leave the valve stem in place.

&gt; How important is valve geometry to this problem?  Specifically, the
angle
&gt; between the valve adjuster and the valve stem. I have seen some pretty
&gt; slap-dash valve trains out there :-(  and tho I have not measured the
&gt; angle, my gut feeling is that it is upwards of 5 degrees

Considering the angle through which the rocker turns in its travel, 5
degrees doesn't seem so bad, as long as the angle passes through zero
somewhere in its travel, preferably when the valve is nearly fully open.

&gt; And if it is important, what can be done to measure and correct the
angle
&gt; at the rocker and the valve head when the come in contact?  Shim the
&gt; rocker shafts?

This is one route, but you would probably have to make custom pushrods
to get the geometry exactly right.  If you shim the rocker shaft to
get the valve angle right, the only thing that can be changed at that
point is the pushrod length.  Adjustable pushrods, anyone?
