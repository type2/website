Subject: a word on materials safety

In response to the post concerning chem clean id like to share a
warning.   I know the words &quot;dump this stuff&quot; were not meant literally
(so im not trying to attack anyone :) but they got me thinking.  Be very
careful not only in using strong solvents but also in there disposal.
Any material that contains a strong solvent (i.e. paint thinner
degreaser kerosene etc.) Should never be thrown out with regular trash
or dumped in your yard or the nearby woods etc.  materials like this can
and do come back to haunt us.  If you dump these materials in the ground
they can end up in someone's well water or some kid will play in the
dirt where you dumped it. If breathing the fumes make us dizzy you can
image the results when these materials are ingested.  The pathway may be
complex but chemicals dumped in the environment manage to work their way
back to us.  If you cannot have a material properly disposed of then
don't use it.  Save yourself the exposure and let the pros do it. (they
have the proper protective gear and will dispose of it properly) . Sorry
for the lecture but this is my field and i just want to remind everybody
to be safe.  If anyone has any related questions they can email me
directly
sorry to sound like someone's mom
keep on busin
James
