OK, so I'm doing my first tune up on Speedy.  I went to my favorite VW
parts store, picked up points, cap, rotor, plugs and inline fuel filter.
 All ignition parts are Bosch, by the way...

After I already gapped the new plugs, I discovered there are two of one
and two of another.  All four are 'Bosch Super' W8AC, but two's boxes
are asking for a 0.7 mm gap, and the other are 0.6 mm gap.

OK, let's see what kind are in the motor now.  They are much longer in
the threaded area, and gapped much bigger than what the book said.  These
are Bosch as well, W8DC, and gapped to ~0.065.

What's better?  The longer W8DC's or the shorter W8AC's?  Should I gap
to the box (man. specs) or the Bentley specs?  Do the numbers on the
ceramic area mean anything?

Engine is a Type 1 1600 dp in a 1970 transpo.

Thanks,
