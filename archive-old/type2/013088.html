&gt;does she look good.  Is this body work acceptable to the 
purist?  And
&gt;about the paint scheme, I would like to add a &quot;V&quot; Nose two

tone paint
&gt;job in the future.  Is this considered appropiriate to the

purist?

Purists are generally never happy... so paint a V or a
giant S on the front if you want! 
Dan
