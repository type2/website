I want to install a surf rack to the top of my 1970 westy  pop-top. Sounds 
easy, Not so, I park  in a garage and only have 2 inches of clearance now. So 
the rack  will have to be portable. For local stuff  I put my boards inside 
with bed down. Someone told me they saw a bracket (like the shape of a roof 
gutter) permanently mounted to fiberglass top, then a gutter mounted rack 
mounted to that. Has anyone done something like this with a rack. I am 
thinking of making a stainless or aluminum bracket, any thoughts?
