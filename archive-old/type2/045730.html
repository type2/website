Subject: [T2] Sealing heat ducts...

Hi all -

Well, after going back &amp; forth between:  oil leak, or &quot;schmutz&quot; in the 
exchangers? I think it could be a bit of both.  Since exchangers aren't 
dismantled, I'm going to use some cleaning agent (Nikki, didn't you 
recommend POR 15?) &amp; hose out the exchangers.  I can't afford new or good 
used ones ATT.

Additionally, since I'm still not exactly certain where the exhaust is 
getting into heater system - above or below engine tin, maybe a bit of both 
- I'm doing my damndest to eliminate some possibilities.  I JB welded cracks 
in my plastic pipes off of the blower fan &amp; I'm planning on using hi-temp 
RTV silicone gasket maker (650 degree type, black in color?) to ensure 
air-tight (or at least &quot;resistant&quot;) connection between heat ducts.  Can I 
use the hi-temp RTV for the duct-to-exchanger connection, or will this cause 
noxious-type problems?  Is this also what volks use to seal up small gaps 
between tin &amp; motor/accessories?

I followed the thread about making your VW into a space shuttle, or at least 
insulating it well enough to collect a few rocks on Mars.  I don't recall 
what the recommendation was for the engine compartment lid.  Y'all have any 
suggestions?  I was thinking about the 
space-blanket-stuff-over-plastic-bubble-stuff against metal, then covered 
w/an additional layer of some sound baffling material (help me out here, 
what can I use that won't toast?).  If not within the copacetic range, 
please let me know.  What's a good adhesive to make this stuff stick?

Is there anything in particular I can service on my heater flaps while 
they're nicely exposed?  Like, how can I make sure there is a good seal when 
the flap is in the closed position? (in addition to good cable adjustment)

TIA, hope to hear from you,

Mark
