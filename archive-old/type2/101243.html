Subject: Re: [T2] Re:[T2] gas mileage poll

cfean:
good analysis of the mileage poll. right now i'm running smaller tires than 
are called for (also a recent thread, found out i'm running passenger tires 
w/o a C or D rating - oops!) and my speedo is off about 5%. At low speeds 
this is not very noticable or significant, but when driving the interstate i 
need to remind myself that the readout is around 3-4 mph off (65 x .95 = 
61.75). At least its not the other way around, such that my speed is actually 
HIGHER than what the speedo says, but even if it was i could still drive it 
at the right speed, knowing that the problem existed. In any case, the point 
i was trying to make was that there's not really any easy way to get an 
accurate mpg determination with factors such as the ones you pointed out... 
especially if your speedo isn't calibrated, etc. BTW, I'll be taking a trip 
to Sears Auto Center this afternoon with the receipt for my tires, which were 
put on two years and 20,000mi ago.. wish me luck!

ps Maybe if I fenagle them enough they will install one of those neat digital 
computer readouts for about the dash!
