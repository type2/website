Subject: Getty 78 Westy ready for Fla part 2..

(Part 2 of getting the 170K Westy ready for 4,000 mi trip)
Well, Sat. AM I decided  to do a COLD compression test just for fun (since
plugs were out) and got daughter to help- turns out to be same as before
(after  30 seconds of intital spinning to get oil in there), but 5 lbs
lower all around (120 on #1, 125-130 on rest).  Interesting (diff may be
due to oil not sealing old rings?)  Decided to pull VC over #1, and checked
adjustment against hydraulic lifters- my last time 20K ago I adjusted them
to just touching the valve, but this time did the Bentley routine of two
turns in- feels really wierd TIGHTENING against valve on purpoise, but
hell, this is experimenting to see if power is any better when warm; I'm
sure valve train tightens up when hot, and those lifters should be in
midrange cold or hot????  Any comments out there?  I adjusted all of them,
lifters were tight, so I got lazy and didn't replace #1 (just got to run it
each day!)
   Finally put thermostat in after 110K miles without it- ended up
soldering cable end to braising rod so I could push it up there from below-
seems to work ok, fully opens up after a ten minute warmup at driving
revs.-HOWEVER, when car is left to sit for short time, ther. tightens again
to close flaps somewhat- so when you take off after a sit at the 7-ll,
engine is still warmed up but getting less cooling?? You gurus with temp
gauges, noticed anything like this???????
     Decided to check out this RATTLE at high revs (someone suggested an
exhaust referred rattle-since it's at high rev pt (3,000 rpm)- Noticed that
my new fanbelt vibrates like crazy at that point, and removed it and the
screen over fan (on crank in 78 bus)-same noise..
Pushed the acc. with a pipe as I laid underneath and tried to listen- seems
to definitely come from near REAR of engine, like its related to fan or exhaust.
   Did the push pull routine, no excessive end play; up and down play not
obvious to hand; with crowbar you can wiggle the fan sideways, but no
clicking.   Alternater bearing OK.   Felt in fan housing, no rock laying
down there. HMM- engine itself doesn't vibrate excessively, so referred
play poor choice- going with fan, how do you know if rear main bearing is
going?   Bentley shows 3 mains, not 4 in later engines???  What would
result be if fan belt was run too tight?  Don't get any oil pressure
flickering when HOT and idling either.
   Oh well, the good side is it's probably not rod related, and if it
rattles at all rpms, then I get excited!   MB in NJ- when I get to Drew's
(anyone else of you in Fla willing to let me near your computer??) I can
post progress to list...
