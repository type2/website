available.

60-64
SO 42 (&quot;camping car&quot;) Instruction Manual, (the last of Charlie H's
reprints)
1964 exclusively
1968-1980 I have almost every year NOS, if not real good used ones

These are the glove box Owner's Manuals that came with the car.  They are
not speciifc for any special model, they cover the bus in general for that
year.
