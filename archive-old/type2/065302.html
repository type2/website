Subject: Timing Setting

Yet another question on timing:

I replaced the points with an electronic system (Ignitor).  It was 
pretty easy, but now it seems to hesitate at low rpms, even after 
it's warmed up.  I set the timing staticly, per Muir.

I have a 65 panel van.  The engine block is a type III, but it has 
most of the parts where they are supposed to go (upright fan, etc.).  
I'm pretty sure about the type III business, as the block number is 
U0322513, there is no tap for the oil pressure sender, and the 
dipstick has the bolt-on neck on the side.  According to Muir,
this means 0 deg for the timing.  It's also got a Bosch 009, and
a Solex 34 PICT 3 for the carb.

Any suggestions?  Does the block dictate the timing, or do the 
various components override this?  Also, are there any benefits to 
having this block in a bus?  Any disadvantages?

Thanks,
