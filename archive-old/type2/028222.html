Hi Folks,

I'm on a quest for tires, and have been searching the Tire Rack's website 
for potential candidates.  In addition, I've been searching the Type2_dot_com 
archives for potential recommendations.

I've discovered the Yokohama Aegis GS4, which seems to be an ideal tire for 
the Bus.  Here are the specs, direct from Tire Rack:

Size: 205/75SR14
Load rating: 112S
Max. Load: 2469lbs.
Class: All Season
Price: $43.00

Unfortunately, these are the only specs I could find.  Does anybody have any 
experience these or other Yokohama tires?  I'm looking for good snow 
traction, and good sidewall stability.

Thanks for any help.
