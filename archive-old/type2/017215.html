Subject: Lorax the `80 Vanagan

You all are the only ones who can appreciate this...
The lorax will ride home today after a year and a half of sitting in my
old ( 2 land lords ago ) land lord's yard  

I'm gonna need some help in the future and thanx for helping so far.
It's a long road but as we all know there's nothing like a
VW
