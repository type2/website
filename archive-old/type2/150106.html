Do you mean the peace sign isn't politically neutral?  Dang, I thought
peace was about as neutral as you could get!

Being in a shared-ownership situation on my bus, including my wife and
I, as liberals, and my in-laws, as conservatives, I can't put any
political stickers on, but there is no problem with peace sign stickers
and such.

Hang loose just means surfing doesn't it? Being politically neutral, I
find it more acceptable.
