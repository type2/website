Subject: VW bus, transportation or family member

Dear Type IIers
Sorry for the waste of bandwidth, but I am posting this for my
brother-in-law.
He has only recently bought his first bus and after nine months of being
on blocks in my front yard, is finally on his way to bus happiness.
With that thought in mind, he is seeking research for a paper he is
working on for a sociology course.
Please respond to him. I'm too busy trying to get my westy back on the
road.
TIA

HELLO, my name is Michael, and I have a 73 westy, and I working on a
paper
for school which is titled VW Bus: Vehicle or Family Member. Any
information
or input would be greatly appreciated. I'm implying in my paper that
TYPE
2 owners are happier, safer, and more courteous drivers. That the
drivers
of these vehicle tend to be more laid back than your typical road raged
driver about letting you in on the on ramps on the interstate, or being
cut off in city traffic, and that the vehicles that we drive are usually

kept in good repair and mechanically sound even if they look like a
cross
between a three ring circus and a mobile landfill, and last but not
least
that the VW Bus/Camper is more than just a vehicle, but a loved and
cherished
member of the family, that is always there for you.

1.Are you on a first name basis with your mechanic?
2.Do people not recognize you if your not in your VW?
3.Does the local parts store call you when the get in VW sales specials?

4.Do the junkyard dogs recognize you? Do they continue to nap while
you search for parts?
5.Are you still searching for your dream bus, or are you still
working on your dream bus?
6.What is your maintenance schedule like, how many hours do you spend
driving your bus, how many hours do you spend
working on your bus so you can drive it?
7.What was the length (time&amp;miles) of your longest trip in your
VW?
8.Do you live in you VW, and is there always room for two more people
and a dog?
9.Do you feel that your bus is a family member, does it go with you
everywhere you go?
10.Do you have any good stories about your family and your bus?

TIA
