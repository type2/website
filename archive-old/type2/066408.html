Well I finally got the master cylinder replaced and it actually stopped
after bleeding the brakes.  I got in and drove it with excellent brakes for
about 30+ miles with no seizing.  Only thing to check now is the
generator/regulator/wiring to make sure it is functioning properly.  I
appreciate all the information from everyone and am ecstatic to be able to
drive my bus after 19 months of work. :)
