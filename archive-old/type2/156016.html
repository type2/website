Subject: Re: [T2] A Friday Busaru Story (spotop)

&gt; Once the engine is warmed
&gt; up, pre-heating the combustion air looks bad, doesn't it?  You want
&gt; to take in as much oxygen as possible per intake stroke, so  you want
&gt; the densest air i.e coolest air for the motor.

Fab a radiator mounting plate that fully covers the opening between
the vent and the engine compartment. Sheet metal will be necessary
here because of the odd angles it'll have to make. Cut a 4&quot; hole away
from the radiator and run one of the many &quot;fresh air&quot; filter rigs out
there through it into the vent.

So you end up with a rectangular hole for the radiator and a round
hole for the intake.
