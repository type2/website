Subject: The Type IV Beast is ALIVE!
Message-ID: &lt;377077C7.FBDBB263_at_dolphinsci_dot_com&gt;

Well Volks,  at long last my beast is running.  I got the final things
tied down today and this evening at 20:10 PST the motor roared to life.
After a few adjustments and check of the everything, I started the 2000
RPM break in  for 20 minutes.  It just purred like a kitten, maybe I
should say tiger.  I was struck by the sound of this engine.

Here's a few specs on the engine:
2.0L TYPE IV, BUILDER - Scott Fraser (me, of course)
Stock Cam &amp; Crank
41MM INTAKE &amp; 34MM EXHAUST VALVES with 3 angle seats
Bosch CIS FI System from 1978 2.1L Volvo
Custom intake system Porsche 924 throttle body
Thermocouples on each cyl head, 3 oil monitoring locations &amp; Oil Cooler
air
Oregon Performance Products cooling shroud
Air/Fuel Ratio sensors on each side of the engine
Stock type IV Vaccum advance distributor

Once the 20 minute run completed, I shut it down and calmed down a bit.
After the smoke cleared out of the workshop, I went back in and fired it
up again and ran the throttle up and down a bit.  The throttle response
of the engine with the CIS FI is UNBELIEVABLE.  No hesitation,
stuttering, nothing but silky smooth engine response.

I will be testing over the next few days and characterizing the oil
temps and cylinder head temps.

For those that may be interested, the air/fuel ratio sensors both read
0.58 volts which translates to a lambda of about .97 and is just a hair
on the rich side of the 1.0 ideal line.

Thanks to all the unnamed for your help, advice, encouragement and
ideas.  Once I get some data on the engine, I will post an update and an
acknowledgement for all those that had a hand in this.


Time to go clean up.

Scott
