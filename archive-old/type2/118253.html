Subject: Fwd: Re: [T2] Electric Fuel Pump, YES or NO?

&gt;Just remember the stock fuel pump limits free flow of fuel from the tank to
&gt;the carby, but most electric pumps don't. This can lead to the fuel tank
&gt;slowly draining through the carby, especially if the bus is parked nose up.
&gt;Just something to be aware of.
&gt;This situation is worse on type 4 motors and type 1 also.
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Richard

Richard: I had the engine in my Westy fill up with fuel, to the 
extent that when I removed the valve covers of the engine on a test 
stand, my shoes got washed. I was running the stock fuel pump and 
dual Kads. I never did determine the cause of this.

Could you elaborate a bit on your post? Why does the electric allow 
flow but the stock doesn't?

Thanks, jack
