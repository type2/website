Subject: need a hand in Jersey

I'm a new member so I hope I am following all the Priority One rules, which 
are pretty self evident.  Here is my story:  I owned a 77 Westy and lost it 
(long ugly story, involving a fire); now I have bid for another 77 Westy 
located in Spotswood, NJ (near Trenton) and I won...but I can't get down 
there to take a look at it.  If it has bad rust on the axle or other vital 
areas, I won't buy it and am not obligated to buy it.  All of this is on a 
timeline of about 10 days.  Is there a member in the vicinity of Trenton or 
Philly who could recommend a mechanic who, for a modest fee, would check 
this bus out for me?
This is a fairly urgent plea as I cannot in good conscience pay for a bus 
no one has seen, but I am dying to buy this bus, I admit it.
Gratefully submitted,
Deb Theodore
