Subject: Re: [T2] Friday bus sightings

Speaking of Bus sightings..

I was watching &quot;That 70s Show&quot; and there was a particular episode where
&quot;Eric&quot;, I think his name is.. the tall one that's been in some recent
movies. In any case, he had a Splitty (defintiely not a Bay). I think he
borrowed it from someone because he normally drives that old GMC.
In any case, Fez and the guy with the curly hair were trying to put a
dead rotting fish behind the hub-cap of his Bus. 

They ended up getting it in there, and in the end of the show, Eric drove
off with some girl to California or something because he didn't want to
get married to this other girl. 

Sorry, :)  I don't watch it enough to remember their names exactly, but
there were a lot of shots of the splitty.
