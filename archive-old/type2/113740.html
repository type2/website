Subject: Re: [T2] Bus spotting: hulkamania

&gt;&lt;&lt;  Just tell me they didn't destroy another cool old car (like our buses).
&gt;
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;That same sort of entertainment is even on TV...The UK Telly has a
&gt;show called &quot;Top Gear&quot;; a recent show featured their 'test driver'
&gt;trashing the mechanicals on a historic (Le Mans racer) Jaguar for
&gt;the viewers pleasure...It all started with Hal Roach (silently) de-
&gt;stroying scads of Model T's... ;-(

Yeah you can get Top Gear all over the web. Apparently they are clips from 
various news shows. Usually very, very good.

Another web freebie is the car report on Deutche-Welle 
(&lt;www.dwelle.htm&gt;www.dwelle_dot_de    or     www.dw-world_dot_de). I don't remember 
when it is on but it is on a few times a week (repeats weekly) and tests 
new cars. They broadcast it in German and at a different time in English. 
Usually a few new cars with a final vintage vehicle. Just reminds me of all 
the cool cars in Europe we can't get (and I couldn't afford anyhow!).
