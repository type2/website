Subject: Re: [T2] Squirrelly fuel gauge sender repair.

Hello Michael,

Thanks for the reply. That is good advice. I would
have to use a long dip stick huh. It would have to be
right at 35&quot;-36&quot; long! Plus I would probably end up
puncturing the old filler neck at some point any way.
Your method sounds much more feasible.

Thanks again!

Have a great day!

&gt; up...I usually fill
&gt; at around 200
&gt; miles.
