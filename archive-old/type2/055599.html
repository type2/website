Hi folks ,, I'm on a quest for the old 15 inch rims to throw on my 68

transporter.  The kind with the 4 slots( i dont know if there is any other

kind).  All i ask is that they are straight not warped,  they can be paint

caked or missing clips,,,, It doesnt matter.

yes there is another kind- the 15 inch bug rims.   They take a narrower tire
than the bus rims, and dont have the wide slots.  When I bought my first
splitty, a 59, it had 15&quot; bug rims with  cruddy tires which all proceeded to
go flat in the next two weeks.  So found a munched 67 parts bus and switched
the 14 inch rims with good tires onto the 59, and it handled much better.    

though a 68 came with the 14&quot;, 15 &quot; will give it more distance per rotation.
