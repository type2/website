Subject: More electrical problems

Ok it is me again.  I still have the constant bettery light on my 74
Westy. Changed the voltage regulator,  still have the light.
Noticed that the brake warning light was not working, had pulled a coule
wires of when I had the dash off, put them back on, now I have a constant
battery light and a constant brake warning light.

Any ideas?
