Subject: Group 41? Right size for mid-70s bus?

Left my lights on yesterday, battery too far gone to crank, got a ride
to Costco, the book they had provided zero information on which battery
was correct, chose one I thought would fit, back this morning I tried to
install it, the old battery is 6 3/4&quot; tall.

Shoot! Couldn't jam the new battery in, managed to pop the top and spill
battery acid on myself... measured the old one, got a line on a local
NAPA auto parts store for a replacement. 

Live and learn. Hey, I'll have a couple spare batteries on hand to used
with my inverters when Y2K strikes, at least...
