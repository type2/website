Subject: Re: [T2] tail lenses

Ronnie at Old Volks Home in Lake Havasu can fix you up.  I bought a nice

&gt; Woke up this morning to find that someone &quot;needed&quot; my tail light lenses more
&gt; than I did.  What can you do?  Looking around I haven't beed able to find
&gt; anyone with them in stock.  I kind of need them badly and would be willing to
&gt; pay for overnight shipping. As I am about to depart on a road trip.
