Subject: Re: [T2] # 1 EXHAUST VALVE SINKING


&gt; My thrust bearing is also making noises and slipping so it would be good to
&gt; do
&gt; that at the same time, any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Your THRUST bearing is making noises and slipping?!?!?
How can you tell that? The thrust bearing is in the case and controls the fore
and aft play of the crankshaft.

Perhaps you mean the THROWOUT bearing that engages the clutch? It will make
noises but I don't understand the 'slipping' part.
