Subject: [T2] Time for a new welder

a few years back I bought an EASY MIG 120 from harbor freight at an 
internet special of $135 shipped. It's a wire feed gasless mig welder 
that uses flux core wire. I was doing some welding last night and the 
el cheapo &quot;kissed the baby&quot;. I've been getting my mind set on 
spending the dough for a REAL gas mig, so now I've got an excuse.

I was looking at some Century brand welders today. Particularly a 
Century model 130 Gas mig welder. I see it for $357 and it's gas out 
of the box....so no extra money for a conversion kit. That's about 
$57 more than I want to spend, but the best low dollar model for the 
money I can find here locally.

Anybody else use Centrury brand welders? What about the MODEL 130? 
Any comments generally on a gas mig welder?
