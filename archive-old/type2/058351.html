Hi Volks,

Been writing the last three weeks about my crunched 78 Westy.
Got a $2300 check from the insurance and know a body man
who will get another $300-400 for me from claim for damage to
interior.

I was faced with dilemma.  I had the check, a guarantee for more
money, and a Westy that is cosmetically ugly, but functionally
nearly perfect.  The combined checks amount about to what I might
expect to have sold my beloved Westy for before injuries.

History:  My mother bought the bus new in 78.  I have the bill of sale
and every document that was included when she bought it.  I've 
driven it for about the last ten years.  Since I've been on the list
I've replaced the shocks (KYB), installed guages, shot trouble on
the FI, done some body restoration, and a hell of a lot more.The 
bus is (was) clean.

Last weekend a ran into a friend who wholesales cars.  I told him
what happened and he told me about an 89 Westy with a perfect
body and 42K miles (yes, really).  I looked at it today and it was
beautiful dark gray with a lighter gray pop top.  Must have been
sitting in a storage garage somewhere.  It is perfect inside and out.
My 78 has ultimate class, but it ain't pretty like the 89.

To make a long story longer, I bought the 89 today.  Will repair the
side panels of the 78 with donor panels that have yet to be located.
I _will_ keep the 78 and will continue to be on the type 2 list.

Will also check out the other list.

Thanks for all kindness and good counsel,

Fred Brittain
78 Westy--89 Westy (is it still a bus--what's this _van_ sh*t?)
