Subject: Argh ... type2_dot_com is now frames only

Just tried to go to the type2 website. Got this message:

&quot;Sorry, this site now requires a frames-capable browser&quot;

Now, there might be some logic behind the change, and I appreciate that. 
But it would be the same logic that dictates that FLAPS only need to keep 
parts for cars back to 1980. It's the same logic that says that any 
vehicle doing less that 75 on the grade into Flagstaff is &quot;underpowered.&quot;

I run a Mac SE (68000 processor, 2K baud modem) for the same reason I 
have a '76 bus. It was a good design, it made sense, it hasn't really 
been improved on -- just obsoleted. It will never be &quot;frames-capable&quot; any 
more than my bus will be 75 mph-capable on grade.

I hope the webpage-keepers will rethink their decision to obsolete us 
unix-users.

Bus content: Are there any really good swaps from other cars for VW 
seats?
