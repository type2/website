&gt; &gt;I'm almost certain that you would not be able to.[start the bus without
&gt; &gt;the fuel pump running.]  I'm guessing you
&gt; &gt;might get one or two squirts out of the injectors before losing
&gt; &gt;pressure in the lines.
&gt;
&gt; The engine would lean out and die as the pressure dropped.

You can unplug your AFM then hit the key, the engine will start, idle for
a bit then stall,, then won't restart

Least that is what mine does,, I was testing some components, forget to
reconnect the AFM, and started it,, idlesd for a minute,, or 30 seconds,
then it quit as it was out of fuel,, of course I was thinking this,, then
it wouldn't restart!!
Dam EFi,,,,, oppps.. I spotted the AFM plug ,,, LOL dam clumsy idiot
working on it!
