Subject: Re: [T2] On FI

Hi Bob,
I wasn't talking about the current FI that VW uses for
it's Brazilian products.
I was referring specifically to the 70's FI on buses
and Type 3's.
I would like to find out what the current stuff
is,yes.
Have you got any more details on it?
I can get my hands on a free Type 3 TLE engine
tomorrow if I want it from a friend who found it so
much trouble he changed to carbs.
What's the new system like?
I know it's being used in Europe and the UK on their
Brazillian imports.
Of course scoring it in Australia for a decent price
is another thing entirely:-/
Cheers
Andrew

&gt; Hi Andy,
&gt; 
&gt; You seem to rather poorly informed about the current
&gt; status of FI for aircooled busses and bugs, as both
&gt; are CURRENT PRODUCTION items from VW. Your 67 panel
&gt; van would love to have a 64HP 1600 dual port FI in
&gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; A 67 splitie being lighter than a Bay/loaf I would
&gt; expect you to get better mpg than the 27.5 at 60mph
&gt; I get in my camper.
&gt; 
&gt; This system does not need tinkering with, I've had
&gt; it for 3 years with 0 maintenance.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck
