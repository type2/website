&gt; My question is:   Are there any particular disadvantages to a 73 model,
&gt; compared to any other year?  I'm talking mechanically, not the camper part.
&gt; Is there a better year to look for in a bay window Westy?  I realize the 2.0
&gt; engines are stronger, but do the extra sensors, fuel injection, etc.  make it
&gt; more hassle too? 

The 1973 Bus did not come with a 2.0 FI engine. The 1973 came with a 1700
cc, normally aspirated engine (there were some expections where it came with
a std 1600). '73 was also the first year to offer an automatic transmission
although they are rather rare. The auto is difficult to work on. As a result
not many shops will deal with them.

If you are in California, the '73 has the distinct advantage of not
requiring a smog check. Which is one of the main reasons I own one.
