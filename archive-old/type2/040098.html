Subject: Re: Oil Burner/Front Windshield replacement

Derek -

The windshield is a DIY job as long as you have one friend help get it out
and two friends help putting the new one back in.

I think there's a write-up in the archives somewhere about it.

&gt; Also, the front windshield is cracked and will require replacement.
&gt; Is this a do-it-yourselfer's job?
