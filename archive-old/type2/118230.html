Subject: injectors won't fire

None of my injectors will fire.  I am delving deeper and deeper into 
the wiring trying to find out why not.

If I connect the leads from an extra battery across the injector 
terminals,  the solenoid clicks just as it should. So the injectors 
seem ok.

When all the wiring is connected, I do measure 12V when the ignition 
key is turned to the start position.

If I measure the resistance between  the &quot;other&quot; terminal of the 
injector and ground, I don't measure zero ohms.

Am I correct that the ECU is supposed to ground this other terminal 
in response to the points being closed?

If this is correct, can anyone suggest a reason for my ECU not giving 
the proper ground to the injectors?

Thanks, jack
