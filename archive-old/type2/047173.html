&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt;I don't ask for help too often for The Mothership but this morning my clutch
&gt;cable broke.  I have never had to replace this part and need the wisdom of
&gt;the list in doing so.
&gt;
&gt;If there are any tricks and tips you can offer please e mail me with them.

Expect to replace the clevis pin at the pedal end. There is no room for a
bolt and nut so you need a proper pin. Then use some penetrating fluid on
the adjustment threads and a wire brush to make that wing nut come off much
easier.
