Does anyone on the list have any statistics about the amount of
energy/pollution it takes to make a new car or truck? I too rely on the
'at least I'm not driving a new car' excuse to myself when I think about
emmissions - that, and the 'keep it in tune' and 'ride the bike when
possible' solutions... The recycling argument makes sense, but I sure
wish someone had the numbers...
