&gt;Muir says it should stay below 225, and 180-220 is ideal (page 369). I've

Bah - I don't believe that, at least not with synthetic oil.
I've seen 250 degrees in my bus more times than I can remember with no ill 
effects.  I currently have 107,000 facts (miles) an counting to base my 
opinion upon.
Also, I've seen well over 300 degrees in my *ahem* other vehicle while on 
the track (road course, not drag strip) with no ill effects.  It's 
water-cooled, though.
