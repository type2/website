Subject: leak down test

I realize I am displaying my ignorance here...I'm used to it.

What is a leak down test?

I understand it is a method of evaluating the condition of an engine 
and is far superior to a compression test in the fact it yields more 
data.  Past that I am ignorant to the procedure, theory, and necessary 
equipment.  It sounds like this would be a good tool/procedure to be 
skilled in.

Thanks for sharing in advance,

mjr
