&gt; If you mis-read what I wrote as implying that you will die from using a
bug muffler, then you need to re-read
&gt; what I wrote. It seems like every time I reply to a post, uncomprehension
rears it's ugly head. This is the
&gt; last list post I am replying to, to the list. I am tired of this.


I didn't think you were implying I would die from using a bug muffler,
obviously 'cause its on the bus now and I don't want to die! Please don't
stop posting replies, everyone's input is of value.

Thanks,

Joey
