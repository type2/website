Ah, Friday at last.  Us non-technical and only semi-greasy individuals can
send a few messages.
As for the LaLa vs Drizzleberg controversy, Surfer Bob wrote:

&gt;So the third (or is it fourth) biggest city in the US is sniping

&gt;to endure a visit to somewhere like Santa Cruz or Santa Barbara? ;-)

&gt;Well relax, the Starbucks Empirial Forces have installed themselves on most of
&gt;our streetcorners. You'll hardly know the difference and when you find the
&gt;bus of your dreams, you won't have to scrape moss out of the raingutters. ;-)

&gt;Just don't get caught using a 45 in a 38 caliber zone. ;-&gt;

We Seattlites are very Your-a-peon.  All our zones are 9mm zones.

But there really are a lot of old vans up here.  And you are right, many
have moss and mildew growing on them.  I thought moss grew on all VW vans.
You, being from the sunny south, probably think they all have broken
windshields.  And there seem to be parts of the country where they all have
serious abrasions on their sides.

I am enjoying the foolishness of this lies no end.  I mean who would have
thought there were SO MANY places one could put a radio in a van?  That's
one of the great things about VW vans though:  lots of variations official
(fire trucks, civil defense, ambulance vans) and unofficial (roving
computer centers, kayak haulers, tea cozies).

Settling in for 8 months of rain,
