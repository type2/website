&gt; Yep on 51 or 52 or whatever the old 4 lane up into the southeast side of
&gt; Pittsburg is from Uniontown.  He was more of a rabbit guy, and perhaps also
a
&gt; home appliance repair guy, or that is what it became.  He has been gone for
&gt; well over 10 years, even as an appliance place, just a falling over shed the
&gt; last time I saw.

    FWIW, there usta be a guy in northwestern NJ who billed himself as
    &quot;The Ice Cream Man from Hell&quot;...He had some rural property, a few
    outbuildings and possibly the world's largest collection of old Good
    Humor trucks...
