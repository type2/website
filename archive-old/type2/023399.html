Hi All,
I am going to replace the tires on my Westy this week, and prior to
making any bizarre moves, I thought I would seek some input from the
list.

I have Michelin,185x75 R14's, on her now, and was thinking of going to
205x70 R14's, in a Michelin also.

Is this a safe move up in size?

I did the same to my Vanagon, but was informed after the fact that I
could have gone to a 215, rather than the 205.
 
What is the largest tire that will fit, with stock suspension.

Going bigger on my GL, sure helped the handling, and the cross wind
straight line deviation factor, and I need to know what the limitations
are on the T-2.

Thanks,
