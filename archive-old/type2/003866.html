Subject: Alternator Replacement

   Hi All.
  In preparation of the summer trip my family and I are taking this
summer.(Ontario to the east coast of Canada), a few circumstances have
popped into my head regarding breakdowns. What to do if this happens.......?
   One question I have is, Do you have to remove the fan shroud to replace
the alternator in a Type 4 powered bus? I've removed it while rebuilding an
engine but have never had to replace it insitu. Is it just a matter of
pulling the rear tin and alt. tin
and pulling the alt. back and up? Only other way out is down but the muffler
and r/h heat exchanger would have to be pulled first:(  That's a job I don't
care to do on the side of the road.

Thanks
