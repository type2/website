Subject: I need some help

Hello List,
A few weeks ago I continued to run my bus with a faulty regulator.  I know, 
not a good idea.  Well, I recharged the battery and replaced the voltage 
regulator and fired it up.  The alt. light did not come on when the ignition 
was off, but did come on while it was running. The battery is not getting a 
charge.  So, I assumed that Mr. Alternator had taken a permanent vacation; 
however, when I tested it, it tested good.  What should I check at this 
point?  My bus has dual batteries separated by an isolator.  Could the 
isolator be a cause of the problem?  Any insight would be appreciated. Thank 
you!
