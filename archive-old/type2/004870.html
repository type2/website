Thanks, Phishy,

I dropped by his place,  met him and his girlfriend, and bought the bus. He
knocked off some more so that his old bus &quot;Sheba&quot;
(there is quite a story there) would have a good home. He and his girl are
going to North Carolina, but they didn't know about Everybus, so I sent them
directions to meet up there.

Oh, Don, the owner, is a white Rastafarian, Sheba really is named after the
Ethiopian Queen of Sheba, and I really dig the Rasta stickers and the
Fukengruven stickers on the bus.... Of course, I will probably be stopped
for due cause several times getting the bus to the house.....heh. Hah. Haw,
haw.

I plan to play with it here in Philly and drive it back to Texas in a month
or two.

Thanks again for the tip,
Chuck Harvey

&gt; Hey everybody,
&gt;
&gt;   I found a 1979 VW Bus for sale for $900. The guy called me last night to
&gt; see if I was interested but I just got a 71 camper 2 days ago. I told him
I
&gt; would post his info here though. He is leaving Friday in his 78 camper for
&gt; California and needs to sell this fast. If he doesn't sell it he will
&gt; probably have to give it away.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway Here is the info:
&gt;
&gt; 1979 VW Bus
&gt; Orange and Brown
&gt; Runs and looks good
&gt;
&gt; Call Don _at_ 302.377.5498 if interested. Tell him Joe Sent you.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck,
&gt;
&gt; Joe Fialkowski
