Subject: A focused question regarding charging batteries

Educating a newbie in Charging a battery with the use of an isolator or 
relay.

Concerns : Drawing to much current from the alternator and burning it out
from making it work to hard.

Solution:
I want to trickle charge my accessory battery not hit it with full blast so 
that it doesn't
work the alternator as hard all the time.

Isolator I bought a while ago (for too much money) is rated at 90 amps.
Question: does this mean it will draw as much up to 90 amps or that it can 
handle up to that amount?  Should a person put a regulator inline to reduce 
the current going to the isolator down to say 15 amp? I have read that 
simply changing the gauge of the wire to a higher (smaller wire) gauge will 
reduce what can get to the isolator. Is this an accurate and measurable 
thing?

I feel silly having spent the money on the non-returnable isolator, should I 
simply buy a 15 amp relay?


Different question:
When hooking up a relay or isolator why do they want you to re-route wiring 
from the alternator to the isolator and then hook up both batteries to the 
isolator?  Why?  If I just want to change another battery shouldn't running 
a wire through a relay or isolator to the one battery be fine? Just leaving 
the other battery hooked up as it was originally.

What makes it different than simply running a wire from the main battery, 
through a relay or isolator to the other battery. It will only take a charge 
from the battery when the switch is open.

I wish I knew more about electricity and charging systems (hence the 
question ;)
