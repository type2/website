Hi all,
   With today being friday, I'd like to add my 2cents on this subject of 
safety.  When working with any kind of solvent, do your self a favour and, 
wear some rubber gloves. I've spent the last 26 years as an aircraft 
mechanic, and now my hands hurt from the abuse they have taken.  It's 
actually the skin that hurts, and if I don't rub in large quantities of 
Vaseline Intensive Care skin cream twice a day,it gets really bad.  Get your 
self a pair of heavy rubber gloves and a box of light weight latex gloves, 
each will have their own uses. The only other thing is to use them, Please 
!!!

&quot;Al Brase gave some good advise on carb cleaning.  I'd like to add one more
thing.  When spraying carb cleaner in the passages please wear safety
glasses or goggles.  I just finished rebuilding a 34 PICT 3.  I wasn't 
wearing
glasses while cleaning the carb body.  Fortunately I was close to a sink and
flushed the carb cleaner out of my eye before it caused any damage.&quot;
