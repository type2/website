Subject: Battery tray replacement

What's up, I have a problem which is pretty comon and I need some advice.I 
have a 68 westy and I have some rust in the center of my battery tray.It has 
eaten through but the sides look ok so far.I was wondering how evrybody else 
took care of it.Who sells the cheapest but good quality battery tray tin?Do I 
need to pull motor or can I work around?How do I go about it?I have a buddy 
with Mig welder-plasma cutter and all that stuff, will I warp the quarter 
panel of my bus or will the paint bubble.Let me know, you can email me direct 
if you got some advice for me, I like to do the job right.
Thanks,
Casey-68 westy/nor cali
