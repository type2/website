Subject: RE: [T2] new engine ...no power

What year and model of engine? Carbureted or fuel infected? 009 or stock
dizzy. All this info will help the list help you solve your problem.

ronnie

ps. Start the engine, hold the throttle open to 3000 (if possible) rpm,
rotate the dizzy and see if anything changes. Just a thought

&gt;double check timing,
checked it 100 times
&gt;and double check valve clearance,
my next thing to try
any clues as to why?
i know they were at .006 b4 i started it?
sounds like it must be the valves, just wonder how/why
