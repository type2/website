&gt;but I did find quite a few posts where people said that they never put the

&gt;rpms, for extended periods of time. Slow piston speed, bullet-proof bottem
&gt;end. Give it a try. You'll be rather happy with the results. And so a closing
&gt;question. Am I the only one who drives like I've been pithed? Do most of you
&gt;folks &quot;baby&quot; your rigs, never coming near red-line, for any reason? Never
&gt;exceed 60mph? Now I'm very curious...

I do not baby my bus, but I do avoid flooring it for extended periods as it
runs hotter than I am comfortable with when I do that.  It was 102 degrees
F here today.  I agree that the type4 engine has a bullet-proof bottom end
and a short stroke and can take the revs, but I get better mileage and run
cooler at lower rpms.

Those with 72-74 dual-carb engines are probably in a similar situation.  My
engine makes peak torque at 3000 rpm - above that, reduced volumetric
efficiency causes mileage to drop and excess heat to be generated.  I
either drive fast or get good mileage depending on how much time I have to
get where I'm going.  I've seen the far side of 80mph several times (near
5000 rpm) with no perceived ill effects, and I'll do it again, if it feels
right.  :-)  Other times I drive 55 and am rewarded with 20mpg.
