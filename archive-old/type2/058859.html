Subject: RE: Paint Job For A Westy

I got 3 estimates to paint mine; $1,200.00 ( MAACO), $2,500.00 (Pro body shop) and $5,000.00 (VW Resto specialist). I did it myself for about $350.00 in my father-in-laws garage, and it took every bit of a week, working 8-10 hours a day. I ended up with a 50/50 paint job ( Looks good from 50 feet or at 50 MPH) but it still looks a hell of a lot better than it did. I'm gonna have to do it over again anyway, as I'm about to start cutting out the Bondo'd areas and weld in new sheet metal. BTW, do not leave areas you've sanded painted with primer, it is not a sealer, and will soak up water and rust the metal even worse. Hit the areas you've primered with any can of paint, even cheap stuff, just don't leave it primered.   Jeff
