&gt; &gt;Yeah, it's a mystery to me how they are still in business. But,
just a few  
&gt; &gt;years ago they'd be screwing us all and we would'nt have known how
wide 
&gt; &gt;spread the problem was. Thanks to the Internet, the word is out on
these 
&gt; &gt;folks, and many more just like them! Jeff S.

There are still lots of folks out there that are not on the internet,
so GEX, et al. aren't really feeling the pinch yet.
&gt; 
&gt; I suspect that they stay in business by churning out a few decent
engines
&gt; along with the bad ones.

My feeling is that if they happen to get, say, a recent (quality)
rebuilt engine in that had a random failure they can turn it around
and it would be the &quot;occasionally good&quot; engine that you mention.  I
doubt that they take any special pains with specific engines except
for the engines that they supply to the VW magazines, etc.
