From: &quot;Greg Potts&quot; &lt;greg_at_pottsfamily_dot_ca&gt;
&gt; www.1010tires_dot_com says those are 1389 lb rating, which is low for a
&gt; fully loaded bus. (5780/4= 1445). Unfortunately it doesn't mention the
&gt; sidewall rating.

I'll have to search the archives for the &quot;ideal&quot; tire stats.

I'm stuck with these until I can purchase new ones, probably a few weeks to
a couple of months.  Thankfully, they are in good shape tread-wise.  Careful
driving 'til then.  It'll help that it's only my son and me riding for now.

&gt; Is there sidewall info on the tire?

Don't know.  I'll look again today.

&gt; Yes, I also appreciate the ride height. It's helpful to be able to see
&gt; so far ahead when you sit so close to the point of impact ;^)

Yes, I have remembered that part of bus driving.  Hence my desire to move
the spare to the front of the bus.  Too bad that there isn't a safe place to
mount my 5-gallon fuel can.
