I made a big mistake, I was thinking in my head that Landon
said that the valve got TIGHTER than .006&quot;  whoops
After reading it again I agree with what you've said about it and
not having it set at TDC for that cylinder would cause this.

Sorry for the mistake Landon and thanks for pointing it out
Jaime, I'am sure a few others were confused too. Thats what I
get for posting late at night. O well

&gt;HI Alex
&gt;I read your reply to Landon and became confooosed?
&gt;
&gt;Your statement &quot;Yes thats normal Landon&quot;  makes me believe that you &gt;think 
&gt;it is normal for a valve gap to get bigger than the set  .006&quot; I believe 
&gt;what really happened is Landon has adjusted his valves at &gt;the incorrect 
&gt;stroke,, [ 180 deg out ] and therefore the adjustments &gt;were &quot;tight&quot; 
&gt;erroneously,,, and will get &quot;looser&quot; when he rotates the engine to the next 
&gt;cylinder.
&gt;
&gt;There was a post recommending that he check his pully for TDC and try
&gt;again,,*I* think that is the best thing to do,,,,
&gt;Landon.....
&gt;Do not  think this is normal to have the valve lash increase at any &gt;point 
&gt;in the rotation.
&gt;The largest the lash will ever be is the .006 that you set it to,,, &gt;if you 
&gt;do it correctly...
&gt;
&gt;_Prove_you_have_TDC_ correct_,,, watch the #1 valves as someone else 
&gt; &gt;rotates the engine,, and you will see &quot;overlap&quot; ,, that is when both 
&gt; &gt;valves are closed,,
&gt;you can also remove the spark plug for #1 and insert a &quot;pencil&quot; [ i &gt;prefer 
&gt;to look into the cylinder as it is easy to see the piston thru &gt;the spark 
&gt;plug hole on a T4 engine],, turn the engine gently and see &gt;[ or feel] when 
&gt;the piston has reached its highest point,, the dist &gt;rotor should be 
&gt;pointing to  the index mark near the #1 spark plug &gt;wire on the cap... and 
&gt;the fan pully index mark should be at the TDC &gt;mark [or close] on your 
&gt;degree ruler
&gt;...
&gt;I hope that helps
