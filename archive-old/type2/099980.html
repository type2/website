Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy: Three Questions

thanks folks for the great response to my 'three questions'. i have now 
figured them all out, thanks to a great slew of answers from various folks 
(mostly personal responses). i will try this setup in the future (setting up 
a web page with pictures, etc) in the future if something else comes up, i 
think it is a good way to show people exactly what my problem is. also, i 
will try to keep the web page up in case anyone is looking through the 
archives and tries to access the page. thanks again.
