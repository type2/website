&gt;I cannot see the difference between having flaps fully open and having them

&gt;is a difference but I think open is open.

First I will say that I ran without the flaps with my type IV engine for a
couple of years with no observed ill effects.  I've since put them back in
because I don't think they hurt anything and they may actually help the
engine warm up faster just like the book says.

What a lot of people realize is that when the flaps in a type IV are OPEN,
they do a little more than simply direct the air over the cylinders.  The
left flap &quot;slices&quot; up the incoming air stream into two parts - a large
percentage for the cylinders and a small percentage for the oil cooler.

&gt;From what little I know of fluid dynamics, it appears that without the
flap, the oil cooler would not get much air at lower RPMs.  That could
cause overheating at idle.

At highway speeds I think the closed flap gives the oil cooler less air
than it could otherwise use.  I'd like to fix that but I haven't thought of
a good way to do it yet.
