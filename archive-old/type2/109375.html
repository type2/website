Im not sure if it was a factory option but I think they where. They are
available from a couple of online vendors. I know for sure that GoWesty has
them here
http://www.gowesty_dot_com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=gw&amp;Product_Code=GVW-231-603&amp;Category_Code=cp-ce-screens .
They also have the rear table that you seek.

I think I also saw them at BusDepot also.

&gt; Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I am aware of and in fact possess the Westy snap-in insect screen
&gt; for my 78's back hatch.
&gt; I recall reading many moons ago on this very list that a similar
&gt; screen was available for the
&gt; sliding door.  Was this an optional item? Everyone and their mom
&gt; has old back hatch screens
&gt; on Eb_at_y and thes_at_mba, but I've never seen a slider screen
&gt; offered.
&gt;
&gt; Is it one of the holy grails?  Like the late-Bay rear table that
&gt; I seek?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
