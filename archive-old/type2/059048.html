Subject: $75 bus - and where the key code is

Howdy all,

Well yesterday I bought 1975 bus for 75 dollars.  Long story but some kid
doing detail work for an auto shop wrecked TWO of the owner's cars.  After
he was fired, he had to leave the bus (and title) with the owner (mostly to
teach the kid a lesson I think).  The owner wanted it gone, and that's where
I stepped in.  It's in front of my house now:)

No keys for it though, hence my question about where on the cylinder is the
key code.  Jim from old volks home told me the key cond was on the eccentric
(the tab the actualtes the lock mechanism), and NOT on the cylinder itself.
Found it to be rubbed off to the point I could only read the last two
numbers.  I did find it on the lock on the sliding door though!  I swear I
looked through the archives, but found nothing that said the number was on
the eccentric, so here is a little something.  So on the way home I will
have a key made, and hope the ignition switch had never been changed!

The bus:

Well, it is filthy and REEKS of dirty wet dog!  All the cusions/seets are
trashed, the passenger seat is nothing more than a metal frame.  A broken
passenger side window as well.

The engine is sans FI, converted to dual webers some where along the way.
There is a problem with the right head or piston, either cracked or burnt
valve or blown piston.  I'll do a little more inverstigating and see what
the problem really is.  The car runs, just not well, and can't get up
anything more than a slight uphill.

The biggest score is FIVE BRAND NEW TIRES.  Plus a nice dual battery setup

I'll play around with it over the next few weeks, and decide whether I
should clean it up and turn it into a drivable machine and sell it, or part
it out.  


take care all,
        brandy
