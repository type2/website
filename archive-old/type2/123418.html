Subject: Yokohama Snow Performance?

Hi Folks,

The recent tire thread got me searching the Tire Rack site, and I was 
wondering how people like the Y356 in the snow.  I have Bridgestone Duelers 
on my Bus now, and they're great all around except for the road noise.  I've 
been looking at the Michelin LTX, but the high price has me looking 
elsewhere as well.  I don't want to start the tire FRAT (Frequently 
Recurring Annoying Thread) again, I'm just curious.

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.
