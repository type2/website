Subject: Insulation

Hi -
I was browsing the archive and found a fascinating series of articles related
to insulating a bus, but the were a number of questions that remained in my
mind, such as where to obtain some of the materials.  They recommended using
&quot;Q-Pads, Kool Patch and NASA insulation.&quot;  I know about Kool Patch, but has
anyone else an idea as to what &quot;Q-Pads and NASA insulation&quot; are and where they
can be had?

Cheers,
