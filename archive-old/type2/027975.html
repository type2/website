What goes in must come back out!

You see where the wire comes in to feed power to the ignition switch? There's another set of wires that come back out and feed the fuse panel for those other devices. The switch is a series of bumpy plates to feed these other wires. When the key is turned and the bumps connect, the juice is fed. Sometime two or more bumps make contact and feed multiple wires from the same key position.

On the stock '71:

-  the wire feeding power to the headlights is yellow and black striped (2.5 gauge). It comes into a five-way connector and connects with a red and black striped wire that goes over to the light switch (4 gauge).

- two wires feed the starter:

+ a solid red wire feeds a couple terminals in the fuse box, including one to terminal 30 on the starter solenoid, the interior lights, the clock (if you have one), the ignition key buzzer (if it's still connected), and more.

+ a red/black striped wire feeds terminal 50 on the starter solenoid, which is bridged over to the starter itself.

&gt;From what you've described, I suspect the solid red wire will not have power to it when the key is turned to ON. That indicates that the electrical portion of your switch is damaged and that switch must be replaced. There is a way to hack in a temporary fix, but the wires we're dealing with are the heavy gauge wires that can cause fires if not handled correctly (maybe *any* of the wires can) and my knowledge of electricals is problematic, so I won't venture a description of this hack.

Test the wires with your multimeter where they come into the connector; if you test at the back of the ignition switch, you run the risk of bridging two terminals and shorting something out. Make notes for yourself as you test. It's easy to get confused dealing with wires. Draw yourself diagrams if you need to.

Hope this has helped! Joe
