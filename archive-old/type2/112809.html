Subject: Re: [T2] OT: FRS and GMRS radios

We have a bunch of the AAA FRS motorola radios (I think the 5420s-the
red ones) and they lasted an entire 5 day trip to yosemite on the same
batteries -- used them all the time.  We were also able to talk to
each-other from the sunrise lakes to clouds rest.

&gt; &quot;Sub codes&quot; are good if you want to limit conversation to only one other
