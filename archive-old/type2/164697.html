Subject: Re: [T2] Z Bed Question

Jeff asked:

 This may be a dumb question but I just don't know. When purchased our '78 had no seats at all in the back. Is
there a full length Z Bed available for bays?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

A Z Bed is [was] made by Z Products to convert a bus rear seat into a fold-down bed. The company is still
around but they no longer make Z Beds.

Good luck finding Z Bed hinges. Here are pics of the true Z bed hinges:

What you mean and want is a Westfalia bed. Do NOT call a Westy bed a Z Bed. Wrong name.

Only 74 and 75 Westies had full width beds. 68-73 were 3/4 length with a cabinet on the pass side. 76-79 wear
3/4 length with the cabinets on the drivers side.
