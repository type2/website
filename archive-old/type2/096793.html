Subject: canoe on a westfalia?

From those of you who have mounted/racked a canoe on a Westfalia
fibreglass top...I have a '71 Westy with which I need to transport a
canoe. Do I need to invest in the Thule rack system with the &quot;super-high&quot;
rain gutter feet, or do foam pads on the canoe rails suffice? I have about
a 5-6 hour drive coming up with the canoe on top (one way), and I don't
want to risk destroying the top of the van... 

Tips/hints/advice?? 

Thanks!
