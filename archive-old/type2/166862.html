Subject: Help with rings

Hi Volks,

I am in the process of putting my engine back together for my bus  
after it died out on me on the August long weekend... The engine in  
question is a 914/411-series case with domed pistons. I have removed  
the pistons, jugs and cylinders and everything measures out as OK to  
be reassembled. The wrist-pins have been lightly machined for a  
slightly looser fit, and the pistons have been bead-blasted to clean  
the ring grooves.

The valves have all been pulled and the guides are fine; the valves  
were then lapped into the guides and since I had it apart and the  
dremel was handy I cut in a keyway at the #3 spark plug hole and then  
ground away all the casting flash from between the fins. Everything  
seems to be good to go.

The only question now is about re-installing the rings. I didn't mark  
them when I took it apart and I don't know for certain which ring  
goes to which groove. When I took the engine apart I found the rings  
were tight on #1 and #2 piston; I have heard this is not uncommon on  
this engine. I  was hoping that the cleaning would fix this but it  
doesn't seem to be the case.

Do I need new rings, or do I need to have a machine shop open up the  
grooves a bit?

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
