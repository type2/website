Subject: Re: [T2] POR 15

I heard of a friend of a friend etc, used por15 on his
ol rusted out 41 ford chassis 15 years ago, like
snoopy said he and his dad merely lightly sanded it
metal etched etc, and wham applied the por15..... 

time goes by and it still has been sitting in the
direct sun, and is back east and has still not rusted
threw... though it has oxidized....
