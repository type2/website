&gt;Hey Volks,

&gt;As I was driving around earlier (116* today) I was wondering if any later
&gt;model &quot;loafs&quot;  ('72-'79) ever had Air Conditioners.
&gt;
&gt;If they did, are they effective?

My '73 has A/C, but it has not worked in at least 10 years.  Now that I
have moved to Texas, you can bet that fixing it has moved way up on my list
of things to do.  I think when it is working it will be strong, because it
has dual fans on both the evaporator and condensor.  Looks like it was
built to cool a lot of air.  I plan on updating it to work with the
CFC-free refrigerant so it will be usable for a while.  Of course, I'll
post my experiences to the list (and the web!).
