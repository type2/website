Hmmmmmmm

I was getting confused between a Voltage Isolator and a split charge relay.

So, what exactly is a Voltage Isolator, is it just a bunch of diodes? It must be
an American thing, as in the UK virtually all twin battery installations are
done using a split charge relay, which disconnects the 2 batteries' +ve terminals
when the ignition is off. Indeed, some more sophisticated installations have an
arrangement whereby the current to 2nd battery is disconnected at low alternator
output conditions (I think its wired via the warning lamp).

Which brings us on to an interesting side issue.....I have my camper electrics,
high power stereo, power windows, accessories socket, etc. all connected to the
second battery, so that the electrics from the first battery are more/less stock.
When I get on site, after a few days the second battery is almost flat (I have a
colour TV as well), so I will occasionally 'borrow' additional power from the
primary battery. Maybe its time for a third battery? Or a bigger second battery?
Should I go for the option of deep-cycle camping battery or stick with a car one?
I have space for a third battery (just), should I just connect 2nd and 3rd
batteries in parallel? Maybe an ammeter or two to watch what is going where would
be a good idea (I already have voltmeters for each battery, v_dot_useful!)?

I've been deliberately wooly here, I'm looking at encouraging discussion on the
whole topic of additional electrical power.
