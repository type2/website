&gt;I used a panel door covered with blanket, and propped against the window to
&gt;catch the old glass as I removed it, and to stop the new glass popping out. I
&gt;found it exhausting and nerve-wracking to get the new glass in. It wasn't
&gt;until
&gt;I got the last 6&quot; of cord out that the whole thing fell into place. Lots of
&gt;banging &amp; pushing. My fore-arms haven't ached so much since I last fitted
&gt;my own
&gt;tyres. I used 6mm braided nylon, and swarfega.

I stand on the cab floor hanging out the door and push with one hand while
I pull the cord with the other, switching doors to do each side.  I've done
the front windshield three times now solo, and I can honestly say that it's
not that difficult.  I angle the bottom in first and usually have to start
over once because of the window not seating completely.  Use firm pressure
&gt;from the outside, but under no circumstances should you use any type of
jarring impact to try and seat the windshield!  Just slow steady pressure,
spread out as much as possible by your hand(s).
