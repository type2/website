Hey all,
While riding back from EveryBus today, Steve Dolan and I stopped off in
Danville, VA for lunch.  We spotted at a used car sales place called Airside
Autos a decent air-cooled 7-passenger Vanagon.

We looked it over, it is very solid but it's got a few nicks and dents.  No
rust to speak of though.  Very clean in that regard.  It's the orange lower
half with the cream color top half.  The engine looked good, not oily
underneath, heat exchangers looked good, engine still has FI.  It has some
weird aftermarket exhaust after the heat exchangers with a straight pipe
replacing the catalytic converter so it wouldn't pass smog in northern VA as
is.  The odometer read about 90,000 miles, and Vanagons have the 6-digit
odometer.  The first digit was 0.  This Bus was clean enough to actually be
a 90K mile Bus so I suspect that mileage is accurate.  The interior was very
clean, the seat upholstery was in great shape, carpet in good shape, and
even had a fire extinguisher mounted to the B pillar behind the driver :-)

This place Airside Autos is on Route 360 in Danville near the junction of
Rt. 360 and Rt. 29.  They said they wanted $2500 for it.  Anyone who is
looking to pick up a clean 7-pass. a/c Vanagon, this may be worth looking
at.  Just passing it along...

I'll have some EveryBus pics up as soon as possible.  It was a great time
with an amazing turnout!
