Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Marval Mystery Oil

I love it!!

My results are exactlly the opposite.  I put it in my 78 that had been
sitting for 8 years, so it would clean things up.....really noisy on
startup until I changed back to regular oil....now, very quiet quickly.

The stuff really is amazing&lt;grin&gt;

Cheers, dave
