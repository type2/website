&lt;&lt; I bought one of these recently and it works beautifully. They are not
available readily in north america, mine came here via a mechanic friend,
who sold it to me. He feels is it very close in accuracy to his 5,000
snap-on analyzer. They cost about 250 euros new, but the one in the ebay_dot_de
link is cheaper than one trip to get a test.  There is a British company,
Gunsons, who make a similar unit. For some reason these testers are not
popular here, but are in europe.
