Subject: underbus metal

i have what may be a dumb question: while doing my fall inspection (lube,
tighten, knock off rust and zap it with zinc-rich paint(until I can grind
it)) under the 70, I thought, man if I just attach a piece (well, several
pieces, actually) of sheet metal under here, things would stay much
prettier! Is this goofy? It would take a few sheetmetal screws and some
careful measuring and cutting, but it seems that road noise, underbody
rust, and heat loss from the heater tubes would be reduced. Using a seal
around any edges you can do so would help keep water from getting in and
staying in. Since the loaf has all the aerodynamic qualities of a brick
anyways, I can't imagine this would affect things in that dept. Of course,
it would make maintenence day just a little longer, but the more time I
spend w/ the bus the happier I am, so... just a thought.

*love* modifications done to car bodies!)
