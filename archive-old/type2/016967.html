     They were every bit as impatient then. What gets me is the truckers
-- I've spent more time waiting for 18wheelers to make a turn or just
get out of the way than they've ever waited for me, but they seem to be
highly irate if they get behind you on a hill. Of course, with my '73
w/2.0L and FI, I'm usually faster than the truckers these days.
