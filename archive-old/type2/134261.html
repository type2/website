Subject: Re: [T2]how many miles on a tank of gas

I drive a 71 Westy with an upright 1600. It uses a 30 PICT 3 Solex, and
around town usually gets 15 - 17 mpg. When I drive more aggressively, or
when the air filter gets cruddy the mileage goes down. I've been down to
12mpg around town! The mileage of a Hummer at a tenth of the price :-)
Your Bus is a heavier vehicle than the Beetle, and the dual carbs probably
put a dent in the mileage that the VW brainiacs intended with single carbs.
Track your gas mileage around town over the weekend and post it to the list
for an update.

P.S. Highway mpg are always better, but my best was the summer drive from
Charlottesville VA down to the NC/VA border at Pleasant Hill NC. I fueled up
and realized I got 26.6 mpg, sans kids and icebox.
