Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Swap Info?

Wasn't there talk about the amount of dust and dirt being sucked into the
rad at the back? Something to think about.

J
 
&gt; Rad mounted where the engine hatch is. KEP has some great info on
&gt; making sure air is moving through the rad properly. Plubming will just
&gt; be flex hoses to the normal locations. No need for extra pumping
&gt; capability since the hoses should be about the same length, possibly
&gt; slightly longer.
