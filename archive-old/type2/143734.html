Subject: Re: [T2] Poptop Wood Frame Repairs

 The wood I pulled down was actually
very dry; Chris... I'm curious as to the source of the moisture in you
case..?

-Josh



Josh my top was off a donor bus and was laid on its side best i could tell and meant for trash but was resurected when the owner decided to give me the top.

I think that maybe water had gotten in there and stood at that corner of the canvas and top possibly by the water strinas i had to clean and clorox and such when i got the top before install.

the wood was a little rotty then but not like now it wont stay in with the top with screws and by the looks looks like the sheeting under the white viyl might be rotted as well explaing the not wanting to attach anylonger.

not sure what i will be able to attach to there again.

I dont think there is a hole in the very top i have been in some hard rains and not gotten wet inside and lifted after the storm to check and see if everything got soaked or not...?

now my sliding door seems to leak alot in a heavy rain though (bad experience camping so know now LOL)



Peace and Love
Chris
