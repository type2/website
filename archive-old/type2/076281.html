Subject: 120V GFI in 71 Westy?

 
--Hal wrote:

I've looked through the archives, and the concensus seems to be that the little button next to the 120V outlet is a circuit breaker.  Unfortunately the button on mine has long since broken off making resetting a little difficult.  My question is: Can I simply install a GFI outlet instead, and just exclude the breaker altogether?  If not, does anyone know of a source for a replacement breaker?....

I would take scott's advice and rig up something to make it work. Keep in mind, a GFI outlet is to provide protection from a short to ground situation (ie water). It acts as a circuit breaker in that particular situation, but perhaps not in other ones (ie: excessive current draw). So a GFI doesn't provide complete safety. Also, I believe they require a real earth ground to perform their function of comparing potential voltages, so unless you tied off to a water pipe, it would be useless anyway. Find a breaker that works for you.
