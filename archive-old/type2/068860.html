Subject: Heater flap cable '81

Since its starting to get cold in SC I've decided to fix my broken 
flap cable. It is the on on the passenger side that runs up and over 
the gas tank..... My question is.. what is the best way to replace 
this beast.:
A: Replace all of it including the sleeves or
B: replace just the cable?
BTW this is the one with the dash end that looks like a ring with a 
clip holding it together, the ring fits over the lever end above the 
cable for the drivers side heater flap.
Anybody ever done this or should I just continue to wire the flap 
open?
TIA
