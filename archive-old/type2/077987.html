Subject: Re: living in das bus



1) get a passive dehumidifier..sold at RV places.
At least they use to. As you sleep you lose alot of
water this will make your bus kinda damp and
uncomfortable.
2) buy those windshield sun shades that are metalized
or ironing board covers. Stick them in the windows at
night to help minimize heat transfer through the
glass.
3) A double sleeping bag (rated to 10 deg F) will keep
you plenty warm and if it gets colder you can augment
it with a fleece bag liner.
4) use your propane heater ONLY WHEN AWAKE. I dont
care what the manufacurer sez! Install Battery
operated CO detector designed for boat RV use.
5) Cook only in your side tent or the inside of your
bus will start to smell rancid.
6) look into the heaters that operate on propane that
are outside your bus with a forced air flex duct that
you can stick in your wind wing opening. All
combustion is outside. You can only use this in a less
than populated spot though.
7) das mounted solar trickle charger will augment your
battery. I would use a Marine style deep cycle like
what you would use for those little elctric boat
motors.
These motors suck current but these batteries will
last for 4-5 hours on one charge whilst chuggin around
in the water.
8) use some caution as to where you park! You and all
the rest on das list are valued friends to many
people. We would hate to see you get into a bad
situation.

  last but not least... keep the shiney side up!
