Subject: flat spot just off idle w/ new 40mm Webers
Date: Wed, 2 Dec 1998 18:41:42 -0700

All:  Just installed dual 40mm Webers on my '72.  Rus very well, with the
exception of the flat spot just off ide.  After adjusting the vehicle so
that it would pass emissions by leaning out the idle air needle jets, the
bus demonstrates a lag just off idle.  Any ideas how to correct this?

The addition of these carbs has improved performance by an easy 50% in all
but that very lowest throttle opening.

Also, have set 009 to 14 degrees advance at idle, and about 38 degrees total
advance.  This on the advice of a local fellow who builds Pikes Peak
hillclimb racers here in Colorado Springs.  No pinking or anything, so...

Looking forward to advice, and please cc me at email address below.

Regards,
Gregory
