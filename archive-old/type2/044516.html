Subject: [T2] Inattention

99% of all traffic accidents are caused by inattentention.

So I just experienced a brief inattention and ran my bus into a bank on
the short drive to the store. Damn.

It is a '76 Riviera. The front bumper is a little bent, the passenger
door is scraped and dented in, the rear tire is flat. She doesn't want
to idle well.

The shift linkage is screwed, one notch off (automatic) tries to reverse
in park, neutral in R.. etc. Does this mean I tweaked the frame? I am so
bummed right now I can't describe it, it just happened.

God. My baby, how could I do this. I am so pissed at myself.
