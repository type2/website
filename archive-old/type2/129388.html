Subject: Re: [T2] oh no, not another TDC thread....

TDC on #1 (by any means, as you say) lines up with zero degrees on the 
timing scale.  Put a red mark on the pulley opposite zero on the scale 
while you have precisely TDC on #1. This red mark is what you use to 
adjust timing.  When you have your engine running and your timing light 
flashing away the red mark will move CCW as you advance your 
distributor, and CW as you retard it. &quot;Normal&quot; timing of the type 4 
(unless you have vacuum retard on your distributor) is 7.5 degrees 
before TDC (red mark is CCW of zero).

So,
 &gt; on the type4 motor, if I find TDC through observing the #3 valves, the
 &gt; #1 valves, by the &quot;drawing a line from the tick in the hub&quot; trick or by
 &gt; the &quot;object in the #1 hole&quot; trick, do I mark the pulley at the point
 &gt; where the case halves meet, at &quot;12 o'clock&quot; or at the &quot;0&quot; on the timing
 &gt; scale?
