Subject: Cold start &amp; Oil filler gaskets

Greetings,

Thanks for all the help so far. What a list!

Again I have a '79 2.0L FI

I am trying to find the gaskets for both the oil filler tube/pipe to case 
and the cold start valve to intake manifold. So far I have not even been 
able to find a part # for either much less the gaskets. Searched BD and 
Motorworks, plus checked the archives.

Can these gaskets be made? It seems like it wouldn't be that difficult. But 
are they cork? Or could they be. Any thoughts, suggestions, and/or 
experience?

Thanks in advance,
Brandt
