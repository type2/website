Subject: 81 pistons &amp;carbon

I pulled my heads off this weekend and found that they looked about perfect as
did the cylinders when I pulled them. The pistons on the other hand had a
heavy coating of carbon including streaks down the sides. They were not
otherwise scuffed or visibly worn.

I removed #1 to get the rings off and found that the middle ring was
completely locked in carbon and in fact broke into three pieces when removing
it. Currently I'm soaking the piston in easy-off to clean them up with the
intent of simply renewing the rings. I'll do the same with all 4 since they
all look about the same.

Here's the question: Is it reasonable that the ring failure is the result of
excess carbon which in turn is the result of too rich a mixture?
