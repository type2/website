His company sells a Porsche 944 kit that works with 68-70 bus front stub
axles, which will fit the later buses.  Note: he is located in England.

Subject: High performance brake upgrades for bay window buses?
Message-ID: &lt;003001c6745d$b1616b10$6802a8c0_at_marcus&gt;

I have finally found a replacement body for my severly rotten '74 Camper and
I am considering a few performance upgrades, including a 2.3 type 4 and a
5-speed Porsche trans. This also calls for improved braking. Are there any
&quot;easy&quot; upgrades out there - like Porsche 944 rear discs on bugs?

Ideally, I want vented rotors in front (and possibly stronger calipers) and
also rear disc brakes. Are there any Mercedes parts that can be adapted?
After all, they have the same bolt pattern. It would be great if I could
find a setup that would fit behind the stock 14&quot; wheels.

Marcus
