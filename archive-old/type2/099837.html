Subject: Re: [T2] Spot weld drill bits....

Happy Snappy has the spot weld removers--or even any prominent body shop
supply store should have a decent spot weld remover tool.
I think I got mine from Happy Snappy.

Look around as your driving one day--Follow a Snap on, Mac, Cornwall,
Matco or any tool truck--they'll have one--

Later,

Terry

Hey all, 
I went to Sears and a couple other tool stores and no one had or knew
where I could get a spot weld drill bit. 
Anyone have any ideas? And, are they all one size, or is there a
particular one that I need? 
Thanks
