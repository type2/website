&gt;I have seen a few late model buses (with front mount spare tire) that have
spare tire covers with the big VW emblem on them.  I have a 75 camper with
front mount spare and I am dying to find one of these covers.  I've tried
Motorworks, BusDepot, Bus Stop, and many other parts suppliers but can't
seem to find them...Any one have any idea where I can get my paws on one???
&gt;Thanks, John Baker
&gt;
&gt;They made it by clipping(&quot;speed nuts&quot;)the emblem onto the vinyl cover.
