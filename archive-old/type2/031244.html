&gt; I've read in this group before that overfilling a VW engine can result in
&gt; REALLY bad things. I got my '73 bus, Mr. Tang, back from the shop yesterday.
&gt; As it is new I had them do a variety of things, among them change the oil.
&gt; Since I picked it up it has felt a little sluggish. I discovered this
&gt; morning that they overfilled my oil by about a quart.

this is a type 4 engine right??

take the oil filter off, dump it out, and put it back on, start engine
stop engine check oil, if still overfilled repeat the oil filter dump
