&gt; If it's already out I'd pull the heads, install new rings, install new

&gt; inspected, lap the valves.

Stan:
I'd respectfully disagree. I'd never take the heads off without a commitment
to checking and likely replacing the exhaust valves and guides. Since new
guides are not perfectly concentric, this also means regrinding/cutting the
seats. The number one internal failure is the exhaust valves. Often this is
caused by too loose guides.
I have, in the past, just turned an engine over with a breaker bar and felt
even compression. If it turns easier on one 180 degree stroke and you hear a
whoosh, that's not good. I'd just take off the top tin  and clean out the
mouse nests, grit and extra spark plugs.
Take my chances.
