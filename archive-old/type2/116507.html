Subject: TO bearing - engine pull - ??'s

Following this closely as the TO Bearing squeals like a you-know-what in my 65.

What does the fuel tap/reserve switch (same thing?)
do? I know it's kinda self explanatory, but can someone help a recovering baywindow guy with this?

Also, is the 68-71 tank a junkyard find only?

thanks,

Billy

&gt;This is also a good time to install the 1968-71 
&gt;larger bus gas tank, and reserve switch if you do &gt;not have one!
