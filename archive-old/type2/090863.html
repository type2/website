&gt;2) Consider the fact that to accurately attribute the pollution a 
passenger 
&gt;plane produces it should be compared to the total pollution of 
the plane 
&gt;divided by the number of passengers on it.  When it's massive 
pollution is 
&gt;paired down to an individual person it is considerably less than 
if that 
&gt;person drove a car that distance.  This fact is similar to 

Jay,

Do you really know this for a fact or are you just speculating?  
My guess is that jets burn thousands of gallons of fuel on a cross-
country flight with no thought whatsoever to emissions.  Dividing 
that by 100 people doesn't seem like it could beat the 80 gallons 
of gas burned virtually emissions-free by a late-model Honda Civic 
(for example) for the same trip.

dividing the 
&gt;pollution that an 8 passenger bus or a camper produces in half 
due to the 
&gt;fact that otherwise you would take two cars for the people, or in 
the case 
&gt;of a camper, and additional vehicle for gear and people.  
Therefore, the bus 
&gt;or camper usually comes out polluting allot less.  

Wishful thinking IMO.  I doubt that busses have a higher actual 
occupancy rate than an average vehicle even though they are 
capable of carrying double.  My own bus rarely has more than three 
occupants and often it is just myself.

I'm still all for mass transit, but IMO it is only beneficial from 
a pollution standpoint if the mass transit vehicles dispense 
pollutants on the same order of magnitude as their smaller 
counterparts, and I don't think planes qualify.
