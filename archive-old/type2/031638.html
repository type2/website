&gt; &gt; Now I'm not saying he should guarantee 30 psi HIOP
&gt; &gt; (hot idle oil pressure), although I believe it is
&gt; &gt; possible for top level rebuilders to achieve this (ask
&gt; &gt; Bob of Access Systems about his rebuild).  However if


WHOA!!!!!! Bruce who did my rebuild made no Guarantee's what so ever about
what My oil presure would be,,  he made some recomendations about what to
do for decent oil presure and I took all of them...we had a brand new oil
pump from the Factory (Melling) and he took some time to hone it in to
spec...

but when all was said and done....he did the bottom end (short block +) I
did the rest and even with that I shelled out over $2500 for this rebuild.

he was a machinist I trusted, he had did other work for me, and I was
satisfied with it, I talked to other people he had did work for and they
were satisfied...  so far with about 12,000 on this engine I can still
hold a 30-40 HIOP sitting at a light with the engine in gear (automatic
tranny) so there is even load on the engine..

BUT I was finatical about my break in prochdure and followed ever
reccomendation and then some..  I also have run nothing but synthetics
since the break in....but I think it was a combination of a lot of little
things that got the HIOP that I have....among them getting the crank
turned and balanced and the CORRECT oversize bearings installed.  a NEW
camshaft and the correct bearing size. etc, etc, etc. 

&gt; &gt; Boston Bob is such a great rebuilder, he ought to be
&gt; &gt; able to guarantee at least 15 psi HIOP.  Instead, what
&gt; &gt; will he guarantee?  Nothing.  Doesn't that make you
&gt; &gt; wonder?

actually I think I would have been more nervous if he had guaranteed me
some mythical number...

BTW, I am an engineer in the transportation industry by profession!  the
most recent engines I worked on put out 16,000hp, but they wouldn't fit
into my type 2 , but they will get you from DC to NYC in 2.5 hours
