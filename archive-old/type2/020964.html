&gt; The single relay essentially goes in line between your

&gt; the ignition is off, the relay it opens, isolating the starting battery from
&gt; the camping battery, so no matter how dead your aux battery gets it cannot
&gt; kill your starting battery.  When you turn the engine on,  it connects the
&gt; aux battery back to the alternator to be recharged.  You hook up anything
&gt; you wish to run while parked to the aux battery (via a fuse) and this way
&gt; when parked they run directly off of the aux camping battery. 

Hey, thanks for that.  It really cleared up a lot of things going around 
my head, as I am going to be installing the hella kit in the coming 
week.  I just have one question though, and it's about radios.

   I have an in dash cd player mounted in the proper location.  This 
should be powered when i'm driving AND when i'm parked, independant of 
the ingnition switch.  This way I can listen to it while I'm camping, 
instead of having to plug in a portable. 

   So, do I hook this radio up to the aux battery only?  Or do I need a 
separate relay or switch for the radio.  It would seem to me that since 
the aux battery only gets a trickle charge from the hella kit, running 
something off of it while driving would defeat the charge. 

   I'm confusing myself.  I just want to use my radio when the bus is 
turned off, without draining my starting battery. 

   Thanks,
