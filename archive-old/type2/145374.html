&gt; Hi

&gt; I want to replace old broken seals, with engine in place. I have the
&gt; 2 new ones in hand, but no instructions. Do I need to remove any tin?
&gt; Beyond doing while engine is cold, I am a neophyte.

The one piece that goes in front of the engine can only be replaced with
the engine out.

The long piece (the one with the split flange) goes around the back of the
engine.  I remove the rear apron, clean out the existing bits of seal from
the groove, and install the new seal.  Then you can thread the seal into
the side grooves while reinstalling the apron.

Some folks simply cut the seal in three pieces to make it easier to
install.  Probably works just as well.
