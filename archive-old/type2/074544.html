Subject: Re: [T2] Trans Ratios/HP Curves


Tons of them in here...I am *not* kidding...you can find virtually
anything that is is able to be &quot;calculated&quot; in here...I've been hiding
this one for a long time, but I guess it's time to let it out&lt;grin&gt;.

Their front page says 14,260 calculators...and I believe them.

&gt; Can anyone point me to a reference (preferably on-line) that relates HP
&gt; and Torque curves to transaxle ratios?  I'm looking for a semi-desktop
&gt; dyno-kinda-thingy.  I'm trying to determine how my bus will perform with
&gt; the Corvair conversion.  
&gt;

&gt; P.S. I can't believe I haven't received any responses to the Transvair
&gt; engine swap post.  I'd love to hear experiences, opinions or general
&gt; prognostication.
