Subject: Re: screen-as-fabric and magnets

My mom has made screen for all of the doors including
the sliding one.  She used regular screen that you can
get at Home Depot for screen doors, etc.  Then she
took a shower curtain (so it's waterproof) and sewed
it in a 2 inch strip around the screen.  The simple
magnets were sewed inside the hem.
