&gt; I know this is not a vanagon but I just got back from a local u pull it
yard
&gt; and there is a pre vanagon westie with what looks like all interior
cabinets
&gt; and other stuff intact. I didn't see a frig but did see a sink. Anybody
&gt; looking for parts? The engine is in the cab! They are reasonable, it's at
:
