Subject: Re: [T2] Re: AIRS/ Congrats to Wade... 

&gt;&gt;&gt;had no negative effect on the AIRS site except for one guy who wanted
his
last name removed, which was also the same guy who was on some kind of
AIRS
strike a while back threatning to remove his name if I kept the list
public.&gt;&gt;&gt;

I still think it was a mistake to make the list so accesible to start with
so now we live with a free for all. I think ALL last names should be
surpressed (citing the neato/limbo directory as example) it would provide
more security to volunteers while not comprimising the functionality.
I mentioned this to charlie and wade in private and instead of discussion
I get flamed for it. Nice Wade.
As far as the universal professed altruism that keeps on being posted...
I know for a fact that there have been multiple requests for help which
were refused to people who, while not part of the mailing lists or AIRS,
nevertheless got the info and called members for help. 

Im sorry if I have tended to be the wary one here but someone should be.
