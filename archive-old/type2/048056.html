Subject: re: [T2] Vanagon Alloy rims??

&gt;Not positive, but it seems to me I read somewhere you need extra long studs
&gt;to mount the Vanagon alloys on a bay. I saw a picture of yellow Westy with
&gt;Vanagon rims and I think they mentioned no clearance problems but mentioned
&gt;the expense of getting the studs from VW
&gt;Based on what 914 alloy length bolts cost, these may cost more then the
&gt;wheels.

We have a set of Vanagon alloy wheels for our '72 Bus.  Going with longer
studs is one way to solve the problem, but the easy way is to get the  right
lug nuts.  The Vanagons only use nuts on the front wheels, but have lug
bolts
on the rear.  The lug nuts from the front wheels have a steeper 'shoulder'
so
they go deeper into the wheels than the stock steel wheel nuts.

The nuts do cost a bunch if you have to buy them new - about $12.50 each or
something like that.  I have found that a certain Ch*vy lug nut fits, but
I've lost
the details.  So, dig up the proper Vanagon lug nuts or go to your FLAPS
with
a VW stud (you know the kind...) and get the right Ch*vy nuts.
