Subject: Re: [T2] Steering Pivot Pin Replacement

I did this job last fall on my '69 Westy.  It wasn't too bad...

I would suggest using a socket instead of washers for pulling the bushings out.  I tried the
washers (grinding them down to be just under the ID of the tube), but I found they bent pretty
easily.  I ended up going through my 1/2&quot; drive sockets till I found one that was close (I have a
Craftsman set, the 20 mm 1/2&quot; drive socket was an almost perfect fit).  I put the biggest socket I
have on the top for the bushings to push into (36 mm).  Worked pretty good.  You have to keep
stacking sockets on the bottom end once the 20 mm pushes in the hole... a set of deep sockets
would work better here, but I just stacked my 19 mm and 18 mm and kept going.

Getting the new bushings started in the tube properly was another adventure.  I had a tough time
getting them to stay square during the first inch or so.  I think a good tool for this job would
be to take an old pivot pin, turn down the head to be just under the ID of the tube, and then
drill a hole down the middle to clear the all thread...

I also want to say I used 1/2&quot; allthread instead of 3/8&quot;, but I don't recall.
