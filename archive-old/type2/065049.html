Grounding problems are always a problem.  I once painted up nicely the =
engine bay of my scirocco while the engine was out and then fought with =
poor starting for 3-4 months before I realized that I had a bad battery =
ground (gee, everything else was perfect...).  The lesson learned is =
that always make the ground strap from battery to body as good as =
possible which means no paint, and new ground straps.
