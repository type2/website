Subject: Re: [T2] Pressure plate wear limit?

Richard,

Looks like normal wear to me....and not too bad at that...whole lotta 
rubbing going on there over the years.

The best test is this.  put both down on a clean newspaper(clutch side 
down) and step on the fingers with your shoe.

After you do this a few times over the years, you get pretty good at 
&quot;feeling&quot; how bad the plate is...

Cheers, dave

&gt; I'm replacing the clutch in the 72 bus. Bentley doesn't give any spec that I can find that says how thick the disc should be. It only says the lining should be 2mm above the rivets. Since the rivets are really close, I'm replacing that.
&gt; 
&gt; The release bearing was really ground down and noisy so that's going too. 
As for the PP, can I have an expert opinion to comment on the 
condition of the fingers? The rest of the PP checked out.
