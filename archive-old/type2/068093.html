Subject: vw heater info

when it rains, it pours.  i have been wanting
to buy a vw gasoline heater to afix to my
land rover.  i know there are the models that
relate to the various years.  and there are
delux models such as &quot;eberspachen&quot; (sp) and BA6.
i need 12volt.

can someone summarize the various gasoline heaters
and give me a tip as to what parts are necessary
for a standalone, non-vw installation.  oh, yes,
typical prices.  i have TWO to choose from and they
both want me to make the starting offer.  parts
availability, expected lifetime, etc.

if this is in a faq or has been discussed to death,
sorry, just get me the info...

Sincerely,

Ray Harder
