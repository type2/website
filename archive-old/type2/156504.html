If you haven't a copy of the Bentley book on Bosche
fuel injection, get it and read it. It explains the
various FI systems in terms a layman can understand.
You will have a much greater understanding of what is
involved after studying that book!

There are other FI systems available besides
Megasquirt. If I were doing it though, I think either
one of the GM TBI systems that has been adapted to VW
(CB) or the megasquirt would be my choices. Note that
Claude has to have the off-road disclaimer to avoid
problems.

Easiest? Stock L-Jetronic if you can find a complete
setup. Probably most expensive, too though as the
airflow meter will likely need replacing, the
injectors replace or rebuild, and the entire wiring
harness is old and brittle!

Once you have the understanding of how it all works
and what each component's job is &amp; how they inter
relate... the Megasquirt sound like a fun challenge. -BaH
