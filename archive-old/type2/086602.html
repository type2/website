Subject: Re: [T2] '73 vs. '71


The brakes on a 71 are essentially the same ones on a 73. Both use disc up
front and drum in the rear. They may have used different calipers in the
front, but they are not significantly different. There must have been
something definately wrong with the 71 you drove. I had a 71 that stopped
on a dime and gave me nine cents change. My 78 stops equally as well.
Collapsed brake hoses, leaking wheel cylinders, frozen or sticking
calipers, worn out un adjusted rear shoes, vacuum assist or booster
problems, the list goes on but the bottom line is that the brakes on a 71
are just as poweful as a 78. Now engines are another story. 73 has pancake
motor with more hp and a diferent geared tranny. Many other differences but
those 2 make the  biggest difference.

Hello Everyone,

I own and drive daily a 73 bus that I purchased last July.  This is my
first
bus although I've driven bugs for the last 10 years.  On Saturday, I test
drove a 71 camper as I want to do some camping this summer.  I was
extremely
disappointed with the performance of the 71.  The steering felt loose, the
brakes had a hard time stopping the vehicle despite a recent adjustment,
and
we generally just felt unsafe.  The 71 has been maintained regularly by a
good VW mechanic.

According to a longtime bus-driving acquaintence, my 73 drives as a stock
vehicle of that year should.

So, I'm wondering about the performance differences between a 71 and a 73.
Are the larger disc brakes in the '73 the first brakes able to stop the
vehicle safely on their own?  The 71 needed the clutch to assist in the
slowing the vehicle if I was traveling in excess of 25mph.

I guess I'm really just curious as to how a 73 should compare to a 71 when
both are running properly.  The obvious differences to me (at least on
paper) should be a stronger engine and slightly better stopping ability.

Thanks for any feedback,

Brian
