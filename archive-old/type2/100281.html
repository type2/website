Subject: A.I.R.S. Request - Planning Ahead

Hi Folks,

On November 18, 2002, I will be leaving the mountains of Colorado for the 
mountains of North Carolina.  Specifically, I'll be leaving Aspen and 
heading for Asheville.  I have all of the A.I.R.S. listings for all of the 
states I'll be traveling through, but I wanted to plan ahead a little bit as 
well.  I'm hoping to make the Kansas border on I-70 by the end of the first 
day, which should give me enough time to creep over the mountains and make 
the long downhill run to the plains.  I'm hoping to make the 
Illinois/Kentucky/Tennessee area on I-24 by the end of the second day, with 
Nashville as my ultimate goal for Day 2.

Has anybody made this trip recently in a Bus?  Are my projections completely 
off?  Sweet Pea is a 1979 Westy with a 90hp 2.0FI engine, but will be fully 
loaded with all of my worldly posessions.  Of course, I'm assuming (and 
doing my best to make sure) that Sweet Pea will have no problems that will 
affect my progress.

Also, is there anybody in Western Kansas or North of Nashville who would be 
willing to provide camping or a spare room for 1 night on 11/18 and 11/19, 
respectively?  All of the A.I.R.S. rules apply...

Thanks for any help or suggestions.
