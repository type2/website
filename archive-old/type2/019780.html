My 71 Westy sometimes stumbles on acceleration, and I sometimes get small
backfires on deceleration.  After 16 or so years of ownership, I attribute this
to the quirks of the 34mm carburetor.  I.e., I think that the accelerator pump
is not calibrated quite right, so, under hard accleration in too low a gear, the
engine stumbles a bit until the vacuum builds up at higher revs.  The
deceleration backfiring I attribute to too rich of a mixture under that
condition.  With a muffler in good condition, you hardly hear it anyway, so I
fix it by turning up the volume on the radio.

I have run a two outlet bug muffler for all of the time I've owned the bus -
works fine - easier to get the part, cheaper, don't have to fool with tailpipe
to body mounts when pulling the engine, etc.

&gt; Hiya All,
&gt;
&gt; First off, thanks to all who responded to my question concerning the bumps
&gt; and bruises on my newly acquired 70 Bus.  As a Bus newbie I found that
&gt; information invaluable.
&gt; Another question (2 actually) for the Almighty List.............  But first,
&gt; my situation.  The muffler (possibly the entire exhaust system) sounds and
&gt; acts like its shot.  For sure I'm getting post-ignition &quot;backfires&quot; on
&gt; decompression (and acceleration) which would tend to indicate a fresh air
&gt; leak into the exhaust system.  So, I'm thinking about replacing the muffler.
&gt; Question 1.  Can post-ignition backfires (in the muffler) cause the Bus to
&gt; shudder or lurch while accelerating?  It sure seems as though this is what's
&gt; happening to me courtesy an air leak.  Or is it more likely that I have
&gt; distributor problems?  Everything else in the primary ignition system (from
&gt; points to plugs and beyond) is new and accurately set.  By the way, the fuel
&gt; pump and carb are also new.  Whaddyathink?
&gt; Question 2.  Is there any reason I cannot put a Bug muffler on my Bus?  I've
&gt; been told that I could do this.  But now I'm wondering why the Bus has just
&gt; the single exhaust as opposed to the Bug's two?  Why is that?  Am I headed
&gt; for trouble by using a Bug muffler?  Opinions?
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;
&gt; Mike
