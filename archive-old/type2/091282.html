Subject: Re: [T2] loosing brake pressure!!HELP!!!

It sounds to me as if your master cylinder is going or gone to that
huge old parts bin in the sky. Basically what has happened (most
likely) is the sealing rings in the cylinder piston have either been
torn or worn down to the point where they can no longer make a good
seal on the inside of the cyl bore. You need a new or re-build master
cylinder.
