Subject: going on a rust hunt

My recent rust hunt on my '71 Westy revealed what looks like significant
bubbling and cancer under the mats in the cab, directly over the beams
underneath the floor (not to the sides). Additionally, particularly on the
passenger side, there is rusting where the passenger seat metal joins to
the floor of the cab, and some small holes (a few about 1 mm x 3 mm) along
that seam. 

I sanded away some of the rust to  see what was going on, and read all the
rust maintenance articles on the type2_dot_com library, but what do I do with
this sort of situation? It's impossible to get the rust out of the heavy
pockmarked areas (should I use acid of some sort?), and do I need to worry
about the holes at the seam of the seat metal? Those holes would throw
water into the cab if I didn't patch them and was driving in the
rain...but is Bondo ok for this place, or  do I need to start budgeting
for a new floor panel (is that expensive??)? 

the learning curve owning a type2 can be steep...I owned one a few years
ago and it didn't give me problems..but of course that's because I didn't
care about it... !! 

thanks in advance, 
dan
