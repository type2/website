Update:
Brand Spaning NEW sparkplug wires. One was bad. #4. The hydraulic lifters had 
been messed with as well (too tight?). Sheba is now running smooth. Hot dog! 
Thanks for all the good advice.

Next question: Do we have a list for water-cooled vans, too? 

Mama just added a 2000 Eurovan to the family....299 miles on it. I have a lot 
of driving to do to get it up the family standard of 150,000 per car.
