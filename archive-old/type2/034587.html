&gt;The esteemed H. Steve Dolan is coming to L.A. over the weekend of Jan.
&gt;15 &amp; 16 and I thought I'd throw together a gathering for any listees who
&gt;would like to meet him.
&gt;
&gt;Having absolutely *no* idea of the level of interest in an event like
&gt;this (i.e., how many people would show up)

LA people should not neglect this opportunity, I can attest that Steve is
funny and smart and lots of fun at gatherings. He seems to especially enjoy
discussing religion and politics but somehow he's able to do it without
offending people (he and I are 180 degrees at odds WRT both religion and
politics yet we have never come to blows =^ ). If you miss this you will
regret it, I say.
