Subject: RE: Exhaust systems and emissions

&gt;Tell me what a muffler has to do with emissions in anything more
&gt;than a trivial sense.  Does it soak up all of the foul air coming from
&gt;the internal  combustion process? Do I have a hidden catalytic
&gt;converter in my peashooters?

I changed the subject since it this question had nothing to do with the
original message, but it's still an interesting question.  I would think
different exhaust systems would have a LOT to do with emissions.

Because of varying amounts of back pressure in the exhaust, several
things could be effected.  Such as scavenging (sucking some of the
burned gasses back into the combustion chamber), temperature of the
exhaust valves, the heat and rate-of-cooling of the gasses as they pass
through the muffler, etc.

Anyone want to expound on this?  Or, if its going to start WW3, just let
it die.
