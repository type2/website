Hello
        Since winter is on its way and i have suffered a few winters without
heat this year i want to be able to at least melt the ice of the window. My
71 bus is missing the part of the heater tube that goes under the cargo
area. Any suggestions on what to use and insulate the new tube would be
greatly appreciated. I also need to install new heater cables and the arms
they attach to on the heat exchangers and i'm looking for suggestions. Also
one other thing that could keep me cooler all the vents beside the bay
windows in the back have rusted frames and pivots is there any place out
there that makes replacements for these windows or a kit to repair them?

Thanx Alot
