&gt;Agilis 81s on my bus and I've seen 61s on a Transit. I'm sure there's
&gt;another UK
&gt;listee with Agilis', too.
&gt; I'm pleased with mine. Would certainly recommend them.
&gt;

That would be me.  I have the 61s.  They are great.  Phone a good Michelin
dealer.  They should be able to order them for next day delivery.  If they
don't want to, go somewhere else that will.  I paid 55 pounds each for mine
including VAT, balancing and valves.
