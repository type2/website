Subject: Value of Westy Bed?

I have the fold down bed out of a '71 westy.  I have sold it to a list
member thousands of miles away.  I am willing to sell it to him for 
what it is worth minus the cost of the shipping, if that makes any 
sense.  What are these things going for at the swap meets?  I think I 
remember seeing repros somewhere in the $300 range.  This is original 
equipment that has been professionally recovered and comes with the 
engine compartment cushion to make the whole bed.  Thanks, Jim
