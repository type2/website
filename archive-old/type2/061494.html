Subject: Air flow meter, FI bus

I have a very techno question. I have two air flow meters ('77 Bus). #1 runs
well, #2 is herky-jerky. Both of them show a resistance (between 7 and 8
terminals) that oscillates between 100 and 1000 ohms as you open the flap.
It slowly increases, then drops back, but seemingly to a slightly higher
starting point, at each segment of the brown &quot;wiper&quot;. Since the bus runs
fine, this must be normal, right?

This behavior is not consistent with the concept of a constant resistance
curve thru the flap angle. There must be something else which tells the ECU
what position the AFM flap is in. Can anyone on the list tell me what's
happening here?

Incidently, I fixed the herky-jerky AFM by using the list method of moving
the wiper plate by &lt;1mm to get a fresh wiper track.
Behavior on the ohmmeter is improved.Haven't tried it in the bus yet.

One more thing, my '77 AFM has a part number which ends in -020 , not -018
like the vendors (Bus Boys, Old Volks) list. 
Is there a difference here?
