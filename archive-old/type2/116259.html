Subject: Re: [T2] Cabin Insulation

Hi Paul,

How about laminate flooring?

OK, it won't look stock but it will be cost-effective and will insulate 
well and look great.

Last summer I refinished the floor of my camper with interlocking 
laminate flooring. I put it down over a layer of 1/4&quot; masonite.  For 
additonal sound and heat insulation I'd suggest you use a layer of 1/8&quot; 
foam on top of thinner masonite. It was easy to install and I bought a 
bundle on sale for only $35CDN.

&gt; Hello folks,
&gt; I will hopefully be returning the innards to my 1973 Westfalia soon. I 
&gt; had been thinking about what kind of insulation to use under the 
&gt; linoleum. I have to replace the linoleum and the 1/4&quot; board under the 
&gt; linoleum. I don't know what do use that would have good 
&gt; sound-deadening and thermal properties, yet be thin enough to allow me 
&gt; to return all the furnature to its original place. I though about 
&gt; using the J.C. Whitney Nasa insulation, but I don't know if I would 
&gt; have problems with it soaking up moisture... Any thoughts or 
&gt; suggestions welcome. Thanks once again, list.
