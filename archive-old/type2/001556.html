&gt; Friday afternoon I paid $1.32.9/gallon for unleaded regular in Tacoma, WA.
&gt; this was at COSTCO's pumps.  Majors down the street were getting
&gt; $1.34.9/gallon.

This thread was killed because it's irrelevant and BORING as all hell.
Tenths of a cent no less! Facinating!

Please all of you, read the charter, talk about buses.
