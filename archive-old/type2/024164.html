&lt;&lt; I did the trip on a whim in my old T_at_yota 4wd tercel - i was to meet Ted
Finesman in Louisville and hand off a part to trade to Steve Lashley, but i
got pulled over and thought i missed him so i figured the hell with it -and
just made the trip myself!  &gt;&gt;

It was nice of you to hand deliver that cabinet.  If you would have come this 
year you would have been able to see that cabinet installed in my '74

You did get a good deal on that carb.  It was a brand new carb when I bought 
it, and it was fresh off my bus, so the seals should have still been good.  
It should have also been jetted for a 1.8L bus.

I hope you get a chance to make it next year.
