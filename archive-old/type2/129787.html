&gt;  All of the problems have to do with stopping. Hard to stop that much

&gt; departing. (Braking is a proficiency.)

Going down hill towing a heavier vehicle without &quot;trailer&quot; brakes is real 
bad news. Real bad. I can still remember that day and am glad that everyone 
got out of my way because I could not stop. NOT STOP.... Cheap thrills.
