So the new engine is up and running.  First time ever tuning this bus so naturally I consult my Haynes manual.  Step one for the CA emissions is to disconnect the idle control stabilizer and plug the leads into each other.  I look high and low, finding only the leads already bypassed and the dirt outline where the stabilizer used to be.  The sum'b*tch PO had screwed me again.  Much like every other part (including the t-stat, air flaps, superfluous #2&amp;3 motor mounts, and 3 pieces of random tin, etc...) this unit was seen as &quot;not necessary&quot; by the backyard bonehead mechanic who had serviced it in the past. Anyway, no big surprise.  My question is: how important is the idle control stabilizer unit?  How long can i drive around with it bypassed?  
-Also, WTB elec. pigtails?  i have several that are very brittle and cracked and need replacement but they do not seem to be avail thru Bus depot or Van Again. I especially need the plug which goes into the distributor---what years is this specific to in case i need to visit local recycler?
-Since you're reading this anyway, can anybody recommend a good tachometer?
Thanks for all help
