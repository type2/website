Subject: Follow-up (was EB06 trip report)

Earlier this week I reported on my travails upon returning from 
Everybus.

To summarize, Lurch lost power and it was determined to be a clogged 
fuel line.  To complicate matters, Jason and I tried testing to see if 
one cylinder was at fault by removing the spark plug wires from the 
distributor one by one and listening for change in RPM.  #2 was the 
culprit.  We got to spark plug #2 in a roundabout way (I won't go into 
the details here), and we found that the electrode was bent such that 
there was practically no gap!

Today I got a mirror and a flashlight and peered down into the carb (a 
34 PICT-3).  Sure enough, the accelerator pump injector was missing.  
It obviously got sucked into the engine and made its way to #2 
cylinder.  As time permits (maybe tomorrow) I'll check compression and 
see if there's any lasting damage.  It does seem to drive differently 
coming off of idle, likely due to the missing brass tube.

I've got a spare carb (a 30 PICT-3) that I could put on.  Is it 
possible that it could improve performance for my engine? (see pervious 
posts RE: MexiMotor experience)  To summarize, ever since I put the 
1600cc DP MexiMotor in, I haven't been able to climb hills as before 
and my MPG has dropped - this in spite of the fact that I upgraded from 
a 009 distributor to an SVDA.
