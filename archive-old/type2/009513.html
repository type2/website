Subject: High cost of Q-pads
Message-Id: &lt;199905241541.IAA19369_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

G. Matthew Bulley's heat and noise site has become, for many people, the 
standard for sound-proofing our buses. But keeping a Type 4 can be an 
expensive business, requiring trade-offs. How can one justify q-pads 
knowing that the brake pipes and hoses need to be replaced?

This got me to thinking about Q-pads, perhaps the most expensive item on 
G. Matthew's bill of materials. It seems to me that the high cost of 
these things (about $5/sq. ft.) is the result of an application suited to 
the stereo installation industry. Customers will pay the cash, so the 
installer wants something that is low in labor costs and not messy. We, 
with our buses, have lots of free labor, time to kill, and we are 
cleaning up messes to begin with.

So I wonder if the coolpatch/q-pad combo isn't redundant in some ways. 
Why couldn't one use a material impregnated with cool patch in place of 
the q-pad? The two materials that come to mind are fiberglass (which 
would be compatible with coolpatch) and that rubber no-slip stuff 
(composition and compatability unknown). My guess is that some such 
materials would reduce costs by at least a factor of five.
