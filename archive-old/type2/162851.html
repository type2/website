Subject: Re: [T2] Tires?

&gt;Todd asked:

&gt;what would the optimal size be if reduction of rpms at
&gt;cruise was more important to me than acceleration?

	Given 14 in. rims, if you already have the original spec tyre 
185 x 14 8-ply rated, you cannot gear it up more by fitting a fatter 
tyre that I know of.
	If on the other hand like me you acquired the vehicle with 
low-profile tyres e.g 185/70 x 14, their lower rolling dia. has the 
effect of gearing down the drive train; so replacing them to original 
specs will effect gear-up from the deviant position in which you 
began.  The lo-profiles are also likely to be inferior in sidewall 
strength for a vehicle around 1500 kg with much of its weight on the 
rear wheels.
	Of course, if you're willing to change to 15-in rims, you can 
get a new range of higher gear ratios (all up to same %).  But any 
theory of lowering T2 cruise rpm by overgearing is open to query.  If 
a mere 1600 can cruise at the speed limit around half-throttle, doing 
22 mpgUS, a more powerful motor should cruise comfortably in 
'official' top, considerably below peak revs.
	It's not only overtaking that you have to be ready to 
sacrifice.  I take it your T2 bogs down in top on hills in the good 
old feeblie tradition; have you imagined having to change into 3rd on 
even more hills?

	As an overdrive &amp; economy fan featherfooting my way up to a 
massive 17 mpgUS on my flathead V8, I appreciate very high cruise 
gearing; but it has never occurred to me that a T2 (with std rear 
wheel dia.) needs a higher top gear.
	 In cruise gearing, higher is not endlessly better.
