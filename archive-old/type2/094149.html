Subject: Re: [T2] Variation on Locked in Place

My locks get stiff periodically.  Same symptoms you describe.  I also worry
about breaking off my key.  I take them apart and lubricate everything , and
that helps a great deal.  Most resistance it not in the handle, it is in the
complicated lock mechanism.  It is complicated to get it out, there is a
good article in the library about that.  Bentley is also helpful.

&gt; I bought a '76 Westy in April, and I'm having problems with both the driver's
&gt; side and passenger side door handles - I can lock them using my keys, but
&gt; then they don't want to unlock with the key (thank heaven for the side
&gt; slider)... 
&gt; 
&gt; The driver's side door handle puts up more resistance (it's a brand new one
&gt; from GoWesty that I put in over the weekend because the old one had lost a
&gt; part and wouldn't let me open the door from the outside when it was locked) -
&gt; I know the keys are good because I tested the two keys that came with it
&gt; along with two copies before I put it on.  Also, to unlock it from the inside
&gt; now I have to apply pressure on the inside door latch handle while
&gt; simultaneously lifting on the button -
&gt; 
&gt; I'm afraid to use the key on either door for fear of breaking a key off...
&gt; I've tried using some WD 40 to loosen things up, but it doesn't seem to have
&gt; helped...
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any ideas/suggestions?
