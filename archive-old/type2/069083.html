Subject: Need Beta Testers...

The list on the new server should come up on Monday. This thing is so
feature-rich (and therefore complicated) on the admin side that it needs
testing before we move. Until we move everybody over it'll just be a
gabbing list or a dirty joke list or whatever you like. Um, no binaries.
=:o

If you'd like to beta-test it give me a shout off-list.
