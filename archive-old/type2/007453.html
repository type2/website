Subject: '81 Westy SOLD
Date: Mon, 26 Oct 1998 16:50:40 PST

Hello all,
Today I sold the '81 Westy.  The title has been signed over, the money 
is in my possession and soon the new owner will drive away in it (he 
went to DMV to get a new title, plates, and registration).  

I will miss the van but I can tell that the new owner is going to enjoy 
it.  I've told him about the list so hopefully we will see him here 
before too long.

Fear not, I will still remain on the type2 list, ready to pester and 
annoy. To those who were hoping I would leave -- tough sh*t ;-)

Bartno-Tek will also remain up and running, though I doubt it will be 
updated too much :-) -- But if anyone else out there has written tech 
articles and how-to procedures, I'd be happy to post them.  Just e-mail 
them to me and let me know.

It's been fun...
