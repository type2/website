We do just as many type 4 engines, as Boston Bob...Most of ours are for
beetle conversions, or for 914's....

Bob and I are friendly competitors and we feel the same in most regards.

Anyone, that can guarantee that an oil pressure light will not come on, has
his birthday on Christmas, and holds the whole world in his hands.

Does anyone actually realize the variables with this type of guarantee??

BTW I see oil pressure lights that come on at 12 PSI, or as low as 3, as we
have made a low pressure jig that uses a bicycle pump and a very accutrate
gauge to calibrate and check our oil pressure switches..New ones are
basically junk, and some of them even have open circuits from the factory.

Once again, if someone is that concerned with oil pressure, or specific
readings, they should do the job themself, so their is only 1 person to
blame...

&gt; The standard VW oil switch comes on around 5 psi, the
&gt; VDO switch around 10 psi.  What do you think would
&gt; satisfy most owners if their oil warning light comes
&gt; on at hot idle the first time they run their $2K plus
&gt; rebuild?  Will they be satisfied by hearing that the
&gt; shop rebuilds hundreds of T4s and they're like
&gt; Porsches and don't need any oil pressure at idle?
&gt;
&gt; If so, these owners must believe the VDO oil switch
&gt; people have it all wrong and should be setting the
&gt; limits much closer to zero psi.  On the other hand, if
&gt; owners believe the VDO gage people are building their
&gt; oil switches to reflect the danger point (10 psi),
&gt; then they won't be satisfied unless a rebuilder
&gt; guarantees the oil light won't come on.  If the
&gt; biggest East Coast engine rebuilder can't guarantee
&gt; the oil light won't come on, it seems to me he needs
&gt; some competition.
