Subject: Re: [T2] doghouse cooler??!!

&gt; I dropped the engine out of my 71 Westy to replace a head that has a broken
&gt; valve (#3 exaust valve).
&gt;
&gt; Should I switch to a dog house cooler?

If you do NOT have a doghouse cooler on your 71 then you have a 68-70 engine.
71, in the USA, was the 1st and last year for the dual port doghouse 1600 engine. [68-70 was single
port]
The upper front engine tin is 71 ONLY because of the doghouse cooler.
