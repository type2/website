Others may say it's not a good solution, but you can install the helicoils without removing the engine or the heads by removing the exhaust and getting under the bus with the tools.  I have done this before with acceptable results.

That being said, once the original threads are ruined, the head will never be as reliable.  If it were my bus, I would install the helicoil(s) from under the bus and start looking for another set of heads.

The exhaust studs are a weak point in the type4 engine.  Be gentle with them, use lots of anti-sieze regularly, don't over-torque, and don't let anyone else touch them.  This is a lesson I've learned the hard way.
