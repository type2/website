  hippie  gathering!

I visit my grandmother every Saturday at the nurshing home (Covenant Villiage of Florida). There is this ONE guy who I see all the time walking around. He's got a cane, and a slight limp. But he's totally a hippie. The guy has a long pony tail, and I usually see him in converse (probably the reason why he's using a cane now). He sometimes sort of wears clothing that represents &quot;the time&quot; (though in a slightly more conservative fashion). 

There is a BLUE VW Beetle that's in the parking lot every day, I'd swear up and down that it's his!

&gt; Some of us , believe it or not, are still driving our buses and haven't made
&gt; it to the nursing home yet (they don't have any work space to maintain our
&gt; buses :)). TBear
