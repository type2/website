Subject: Re: New Vacuum adv. dizzy isn't identical to old, can i use it or..?

       I'm not sure what engine that's for, but it's not a FI dizzy,
which only has one vacuum hose, AFAIK. I think only the carbs had two
hoses. And I'm not at all sure that it's even a T4 dizzy -- although you
could tell easily enough if the advance goes far enough.
