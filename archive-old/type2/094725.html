Subject: how hot?


I am wondering if anyone knows from experience a head temp that burned a
hole in a piston. I know my heads are running too hot but I plan to fix it
soon, might be caused by 2nd barrel of solex progressive too lean.  What is
the max head temp you would run for a short trip?  (or what temp would you
stop and pull over)

Thanks,
Will
