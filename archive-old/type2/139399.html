Subject: Fuel economy results with CDI

I have now used 2 tanks of gas since installing my CDI... one with the 
original .028 plugs, one with the new .045 plugs.

Before the CDI, I was running about 13.5 MPG for combined city/highway 
driving (highway speeds of ~68 MPH).

With CDI and .028 plugs, I pretty much stuck at 13.5 MPG.

With CDI and .045 plugs, I am at 19.3 MPG.

I am looking forward to resetting my AFM after the holidays (I suspect 
I'm running a bit richer than I need to).
