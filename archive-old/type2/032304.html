Hi all.
I'm having trouble with my project (again).
I installed a FI 1800 in a '74 bus. I spent the better part of the day
installing a new accelerator cable, the old one wasn't in the best shape
and I had to re-route the cable for the FI engine, it not as smooth as I'd
like but thats not what I came here to tell..

I started the bus up in neutral. Let the clutch out and walked to the back
just to make everything was in order. Got back in the cab and reved it up
a bit. This is the first time I can do this from inside the bus. Like I
said it wasn't the best cable job but I felt that it was adequate to move
her around the driveway a bit.  I pressed the clutch and tried to put it
in first. BUt it didn't want to go. I gave it a little more force and it
made this horrible grinding noise. Exactly the sound my old bus made when
you accidently caught reverse going into second. I immediately but it back
in neutral. IT wouldn't go into any  gear.It did the same thing with
second gear. Same force required, same nasty noise, same user panic. 


It shifts into the gears nicely when the engine isn't running ;)
Is this a problem with the clutch cable not being adjusted correctly?
I know the bearing/disk/plate are all physically ok.

My guess is that when the clutch pedal is fully depressed the release
bearing isn't going (pushing) far enough on the pressure plate, does that
sound reasonable? I was going to play with the adjusting wingnut but I had
to get to work and I'd fell much better asking the list before hand as I
dont' have much experince with this sort of thing. 

Could it be the transmission? ;|


Thanks,

Eddie Goodwin
