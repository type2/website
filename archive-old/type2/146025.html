Subject: Aluminum track...

I've been getting the runaround from a coupla insulated window
makers in my area, who tell me that the aluminum track that
seperates he two panes of glass in a replacement window is not
available to mere mortals...Anybody know of a source? I'm try-
ing to make double paned windows, but want to use wood sash
instead of the usual plastic...I know that it can be bought cus-
tom made, but the price is astronomical for what it is...;-(
I'll be carrying it (if I can find it) in my bus (as has everything
else in my ol' Victorian shack... ;-)
