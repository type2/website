Subject: Cutting foam for cushions

Talking about rear seat/mattress cushions Don Tuleja said .....&quot; But let the
shop cut the foam. I have yet to figure out a way to cut it so it's smooth.&quot;


Foam can be cut using an electric knife with sharp blades.  Yep, the same
kind of knife you would use to slice up a large turkey.  Just another
kitchen utensil that's useful for bus maintenance.  Dishwashers clean parts,
ovens heat parts, and now the electric knife to cut foam.  Just don't get
caught by the keeper of the kitchen   :-)

See ya'll at LiMBO On Long Island, June 10th to 12th.
