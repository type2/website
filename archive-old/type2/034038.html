Alrighty, it nears midnight here, so I'm closing the voting. (Any
further comments should be p-mailed directly to me, and are welcomed.) I
have determined to the best of my abilities that we do indeed have a
preponderance of Davids (topping the charts at 13) in the VW world.
Steves, however, are no more numerous than Tims.

Chuck, who will henceforth be known as Carrrlos, El Capitan, is one of a
kind. As is Charlie.

Next week: boxers, briefs, bikinis, thongs, or au naturel? Stay
tuned.... (I'M KIDDING!!! I'M KIDDING!!!)

The ever-irreverent,

Nikki
