Subject: Re: [T2] Bad hydraulic lifters (rant)

I do not think it was a problem with the lifters as much as i bet you that
when the motor was installed and ran a little while, NO ONE ever readjusted
the lifters...the motor was installed and ran until now................ran
hot, and then the person that installed (or had someone install) is blaming
the rebuilder because maintenance was not performed on the engine.

Hydraulic lifters do require adjustment............it is not a lifetime fix
to avoid adjusting the valves. A hard lifter is what you want...a soft one
is not what you want.  So, in actuality you had one pumped lifter, and 7
that were not pumped.  Sounds like time to adjust the valves, not replace
lifters.  Don't fix what ain't broke. The lifters were probably
overadjusted, thus making them never pump up, and the one that was pumped up
never really closed, for it was over adjusted!  Sounds like a case of
someone using the 2 full turns method of adjusting the valves initially, and
this is what it got you.
