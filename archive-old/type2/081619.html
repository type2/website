Subject: Re: [T2] Couple of questions

(from work comp)
You beat me- 235,000 mi and counting- now the game is to drive it 'til it
fails or goes below 90 psi in compression (and one cyl is there- how is your
compression?)   Why did you pull yours?    The oil pressure is significantly
lower when the oil is hot, so I use 40 wt oil.  That oil pump gotta have
wear- how does it look under the cover and play between the gears?   Also,
what's the gap between rings and their lands, and gap between the closed
ends of a ring within a barrel?   I'm not burning oil, but on past compr.
checks the oil would go up about 30-40 psi (120 to 160) upon squirting in
oil.  Did you have a pressure or temp gauge?  Does (did) it rattle a bit
before oil pressure built up?  The ones I've seen go past 200,000 mi tend to
lose a rod bearing first.  I've pulled it only to replace the clutch disk.

Subject: [T2] Couple of questions


&gt; Hi all, I have a couple of questions for you.
&gt;
&gt; First, I'm in the process of rebuilding my '78 2.0L.  I'm planning on a
new
&gt; flywheel, and bought an &quot;L&quot; shaped tool to measure endplay.  Does anyone
&gt; have instructions telling me how to hook this up and how to measure?  ANY
&gt; help is appreciated.
&gt;
