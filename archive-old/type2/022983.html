Agreed!

&gt;Your Bus must be geared differently, since my '79 Westy can only make 
&gt;75mph at 5,000rpm redline (though I'm using a VDO tach with a noisy 
&gt;ground).  It seems like my 2.0 FI has power for more, but it's wound tight 
&gt;with the .88 4th gear I have.

Not that tight.  I think that either your tach is wrong, your speedo is 
wrong, you have a 73 or earlier tranny, or your front tires are much larger 
than your rear ones.  :)  A '79 bus should only be at about 4100rpm at 75mph.
