	If it's under powered simplicity you're looking for, I think you will have to
back much further into the early 70's.  I think the biggest difference between
a Vanagon and the &quot;78 Westy&quot;  you moon over is that the Vanagon has much more
comfortable seats, a brighter interior, and the Type II is just rounder at the
corners. My wife's 79 is Fuel Injected, has heat &amp; air conditioning, is
Automatic and flies down the Garden State Parkway with the best of them (as
did both of our previous 76's, one auto / one 4 speed). Windy days are another
story.
	If it's not a daily driver, you can get away with any thing. Let the cool
factor really hang out, go for a late 60's split window and be done with it!
	(PS, we camped outside of Chico once,years ago, it was beautiful country)
Good Luck, maybe you should hang out out on the vintage bus list for a while.
