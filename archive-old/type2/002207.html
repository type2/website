Or better yet, avoid campgrounds altogether.  Perhaps not as possible in the
east, but out here in the wild, wild west there are usually plenty of places
to pull off the side of the road or head down a back road on gov't land,
pull over, and have the place to yourself.
Although if you need a campfire, a campground probably is the best option
all around.
Personally, I can't stand spending the night in a campground.  Might as well
stay home, pop the top, and camp in your driveway.
Cheers,

I'll jump in on the noisy campground issue. All that electric noise IS a
PITA, but it's not how it has to be.  Canadian Provincial Parks, only 2
hours from my home here in Michigan, commonly have quiet zones with no
radios, TVs, etc for RV folk.  It's great, doesn't cost anything more.  I
recommend every American visit Canada regularly for a reminder of what
widespread courtesy is like.  They have their bad days like we do here, but
across the board, their campgrounds areas are cleaner and quieter on
average.  I don't think there's any call for artificial entertainment in
campgrounds that anyone outside of your own space can see or hear.  TV
addicts won't understand.
