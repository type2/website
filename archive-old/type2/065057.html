Some time back, there was a plumber in San Jose, California that was still
using a 1957 Single-cab as his work truck.  I last saw his (parked next to
mine) in the Gilroy Garlic Festival about 6 years ago.

The VW dealer on Stevens Creek in San Jose uses Vanagon DoubleCab as their
shop truck.

Isenberg VW in Merced, California, brought in one of the last US version
SingleCabs in 1969, and has had it ever since as their shop truck (although
they have stopped using it -- they now use a nine-passenger Vanagon with
the seats removed!).  The '69 is all painted with fart-fig-nothing logos.
