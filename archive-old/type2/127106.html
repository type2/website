Subject: RE: [T2] Overheating? How can you tell?

&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Conventional wisdom says that it's ok for the oil light to flicker after the engine's warmed up really good at idle. I only see it at oil temps &gt; 220&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;

someone was telling me about this the other day..?
mine doesnt ever flicker?
temps have went right above 220*
hmmmm?
is this bad...?
peace

It just means the oil pressure is slightly below the senders threshold pressure. As long as the light clears when you rev the engine, should be ok.

Older worn engines may have more tendencie to do this.
