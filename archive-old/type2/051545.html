&gt; We discourage trespassing.  Your friend entered the campground when the
gate
&gt; was closed, at night.  He was told that we were closed because we had
water
&gt; problems.  He was not happy about it but he did leave. I guess that VW van
&gt; camper money is just as green as anyone else's.  Bob

&gt; &gt;I understand you guys tend to discourage folks that camp in VW buses. Is
&gt; &gt;there anything to that? Intersested traveler and camper..John Brogan
