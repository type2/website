Subject: Re: [T2] Bay window door lock syndrome

Better yet. Remove the door handle...that large phillips screw plus 2
other allen screws. I had a tuft of what looked like carpet. It was really
25+ years of dirt. I used carb cleaner to clean it off. I put the key in
the lock and removed the screw on the inside of the lock and removed the
lock...watch the spring and note how it is installed. I sprayed everything
thoroughly with carb cleaner. I was surprised how much gunk came out of
the lock and its position in the handle. Reinstall everything. Spray with
TriLube. Also sprayed TriLube inside door where door handle and latch
workings are. My doors work great now.

&gt;the door side edge.  Stick the extender nozzle of a silicone spray lube
&gt;into this hole and aim down as you spray and push -pull the knob and turn
&gt;the key. Worked for us.
