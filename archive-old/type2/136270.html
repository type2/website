Subject: RE: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

&gt; I am not looking to keep the stock 71 system and unhook the servo, I am
&gt; looking to see if i can make the system similar to the 68-70 using the
&gt; non power MC as they are very different but if I can use that early MC
&gt; with the discs.. I was looking for something safe and secure...that is
&gt; whatst i am asking. I was asking will the 68-70 MC fit on the bus and
&gt; will it stop like a 68-70...?  that is the info i am looking for...

I was composing my previous post as this one came in.  The drum brakes on
a '68-70 bus work fine.  If you have the steering knuckles from a '68-70
and want to eliminate the booster AND THE DISCS  by transplanting the
drum brake system onto a later bus then go ahead.  But if you
eliminate the booster then you must eliminate the discs as well, for the
reasons I stated in the previous post.  The brake surface area on discs is
substantially smaller than the brake surface area on drums and requires
power assist to be an effective brake system.

OOK!
