Subject: Re: how much is a child's cot worth?

&gt;hey now,
&gt;
&gt;i have an early 70's childs cot complete with canvass and poles in
&gt; excellent
&gt;shape. at least i think it is an early 70's cot. any way to tell? anyway,
&gt;how much are these worth?
&gt;

I've sold them at swap meets for the $30-40 range.  But be careful, not all 
cots/years are interchangeable.
