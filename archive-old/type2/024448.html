listen to mike g. hes as smart as david schwarze.

ive cleaned out my coolers with a parts cleaner then lots and lots of
compressed air.   even if you left a bit a gas in there, so what. a teaspoon
or so aint gonna kill anything when mixed with 3 quarts of oil. if in doubt
run it for 10 mins then change the oil again. $3 worth of oil is cheap to
guarantee a clean cooler etc.

happy friday 13..........
