Subject: RE: [T2] Cyl Head temperature Sensors

Chris,

I tried putting the CHT sender under one of the head bolts (nuts, 
actually) at the top and it worked fine until the sender went south 
somehow.

Pull the engine to replace the sender?

Well, I waited until I HAD to pull the engine (I can't remember what it 
was - I think #1 spit out a plug and hence those threads were 
stripped), but I (had) welded a bolt onto the #3 exhaust pipe (before 
it goes into the heater box).  The temps are higher, but maintenance is 
a helluva lot easier.

This is on a 1600 cc by the way.

Chris
