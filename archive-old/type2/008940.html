Hey All,

I posted this yesterday and haven't seen it on the
list yet (probably lost in the ether), so if this is a
duplicate, I'm sorry.

Yesterday, I tried to start the bus. The key went to
the &quot;on&quot; position (dash lights came on) but would go
no further. I then realized my key was not all the way
in the lock cylinder. I tried to turn it off and start
over, but it wouldn't budge. It stayed in the &quot;on&quot;
position, but I was able to remove the key. I unhooked
the battery to save my points and tried playing with
the ignition to no avail.

I loosened the steering column to get at the switch
and remove it. Nope. Won't come out. I checked the
archives, Bentley and Muir, again, to no avail. They
say &quot;remove the little set-screw in the middle of the
lock cylinder....&quot; and Bentley even shows a photo of
it. Well....mine doesn't have a set screw! 

There *is* a set screw holding the cylinder to the
housing that covers the switch/cylinder and connects
to the steering column brace, but it's missing. This,
combined with the fact that the ignition key is
different from the doors tells me that maybe this is
not the proper switch for my year. The part# on mine
is 
211 905 88 1, so I know it at least is for a bus.

I would at least like to get the elctrical portion
loose so I can start the bus without hot-wiring until
I get this mess figured out. I looked at it but it's
not self explanatory and Muir and Bentley are staying
mute as well:-(.

I would really like to get the cylinder out of the bus
to work on it, but pulling the steering wheel is
problematic for *several* reasons and last resort
only. I've heard and been told by many that the
cylinder can be pulled w/out pulling the steering
wheel.....but HOW? I could probably force it out, but
don't want to break anything.

ANY help would be greatly appreciated; I have tomorrow
off and need to work on the bus anyway. If I don't get
any better advice, I will be forced to hot-wire....but
I REALLY hate to cut wires!

PS-I have the original VW key for the ignition; that's
why I'm trying so hard to save it.
