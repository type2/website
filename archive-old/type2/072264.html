Subject: dizzy wizardry

yikes list! i was driving at 45mph, the 68 backfired 3-4 times, and cut
out. idiot lights came on and i coasted to the shoulder. craked the engine
a few times, but wouldn't turn over. turns out there was a gap of less than
3/8&quot; between the case and the dizzy clamp. the drive shaft was able to turn
so it seems the drive dogs disengaged leaving me without ignition! now the
gap was much smaller than the length of the drive dogs, so i wonder if the
dizzy drive gear can be shimmed up to meet my lonely drive dogs. are drive
gear washers available?? seems like a little more than a dizzy o-ring
thing. - steve
