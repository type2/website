Subject: RE: Diaphragm-type vacuum unit

If you just put a hose on the diaphragm unit and suck, the flap should move.
All the way if you suck hard enough.  This does not depend on temperature,
it will happen whenever the engine is running.
If you hook up the thermo-thing in line with the dia-fraggum, in theory you
should still be able to suck the flap up and down but it will be harder to
do, the higher the temperature.  That's the theory anyway, I'm not sure if
mine works because last winter I had to bypass the thermostat to get the
flap to open at all.

&gt; So, the vacuum I'd be testing would be in the hose between 
&gt; the thermostatic
&gt; unit in the air cleaner duct to the right carb to the 
&gt; diaphgragm unit? Or
&gt; both of those little hoses? Because the diaphgram unit looks 
&gt; just like a
&gt; mechanical flap that's controlled by the thermostatic unit.
