Doesn't that run the risk of splattering grease all over the flywheel
and clutch?

It is a pretty good idea though!

&gt; flywheel bushings which has saved my butt many times in the boonies. You
&gt; take a heavy grease (wheel bearing is what I use) and fill the bushing with
&gt; it, then find a drift, or piece of solid metal which is very close to the
&gt; inside diameter of your bushing and place it against the grease. Then take a
&gt; hammer and hit the drift as hard as you can, it will push the dense grease
&gt; in behind the bushing and drive it out. I thought at first he was pulling my
&gt; leg, but it works great! Hope this helps.
