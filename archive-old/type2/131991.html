Subject: Solved thanks (was killed my vanagon)

Thanks Greg, Jason, Incynr8, Jamey, You put me on the right track.  The
engine degreaser had severely oxidized on my brass electrical connections
(silver ones were all fine).  On the solenoid (which I had tried to
protect), I found hard black stuff thickly crusted on both the male and
female starter relay connection.  I9ll have to replace the females since
they9re so hard to clean.  Also- and this is the real clincher- the fuel
injection relay on one side was not only corroded but partially
disconnected, affecting the firing on that side of the engine-  creating a
condition I experienced last week on a road trip which I had blamed on bad
gas, so I don9t think I did it when I fixed the seal.  Need to replace that
one as well...Amazing how little electrical connections can hurt engine
performance like that.  I9m learning.  I9m back on the road! yahoo!
