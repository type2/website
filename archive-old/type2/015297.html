&gt;This is a series of submittals addressing basic Maintenance Repair
&gt;and Restoration of European Vehicles, all of which owe homage to the
&gt;German Engineering Philosophy, hereinafter refered to as the
&gt;Deutsches Methode (DM).
&gt;
&gt;All Porsche air cooled designs, including of course VW, can be provided
&gt;the best long term economy by understanding the mind of the good
&gt;Doktor Porsche and others of the German technical schools who practice
&gt;the DM.

Today we give you the quick and simple test for vacuum leaks.

Visually inspect the cloth braided hoses. When you bend the hose does it
break into pieces and fall into the motor??? Replace it. Yeah, and pick
out all those loose pieces of hose so they don't end up jammed into the
cylinder fins creating a hot spot and warping a cylinder or ring or three.

Does bending of the hose show reasonable flexibility but the ends are
frayed and cracking??? Pull the ends off and snip 12.31459mm off the 
end and stick it back on it's fitting. Not long enough now???
Replace it. Ohh, did you check the other end??? Now not long enough???
Replace it.

The now too short flexible hoses can be used for to replace the
shorter better fitting ones that fell to pieces into the cylinders because
they were 15 years old and you had the spark plugs out due to another 
unrelated inspection procedure going on simultaneously with the current
one which is not the DM.

Ok, fixed all the obviously delapidated hard carbon rubber remnants???
On to the quick test, which should be done first, which serves to illustrate
that you should read the complete procedure through before beginning 
which is the DM.

Hook up your digital tach. Don't have one? Get one. Just ain't got the 
scratch right now here handy??? Use your ears. Prepare for an ethereal
experiance. Extinguish all open flames in the immediate vicinity before
proceeding. Start the motor. Rev it a little to burn and blow the hose
carbon remants out the valves if you didn't use the DM and didn't
remove the heads to remove the exuvie that you let fall into the 
cylinders because you hadn't yet understood the DM.

While idling veryify there are no occasional
sparks arcing between the 15 year old HT wires because they serve very well
to ignite ether as well as gas and you don't need compression to ignite
ether. Using common Starting Fluid, ether, spray a little at each hose end,
manifold flange, intake duct, injector seal, etc. See on the tach or hear 
with your ear a rise in RPM following any particular squirt and what you 
were squirting at is sucking wind. If it is leaking very little the ear can't 
hear but the tach will show it fer sur and you can fix that too before 
you breakdown on the way San Jose, which is not the DM.

On the FI models, push and pull at that big rubber S duct while spraying
behind it. They have a propensity to get oily on the lower backside and
develop cracks. If you got them all together, they could form a special
interest group. 

If you have thus VERIFIED all leaky regions, feedback to the beginning 
and start the visual inspection, which serves to illustrate.....

SAFETY NOTES:
If you don't like breathing ether, every 2 or 3 squirts, come back out
and take a coupla big breaths. If you do like breathing ether, I rely
on your prudence to not damage yourself by making some silly mistake
which is not the DM.
