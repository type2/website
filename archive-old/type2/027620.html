Subject: re: no brake lights

What year bus do you have?
I had a similar problem before working on mine (71 westy). The issue with 
mine I think had at least partly to do with unspec wiring a PO had done, but 
it worked for at least a year after I bought it. Could be a relay going bad. 
Also could be a wire shorting out, or I suppose , when you turn on your turn 
signals, it is asking for more power than the circuit can hold (seems like, 
at least on mine, things aren't all on their unique circuits, but get wired 
through switches in the dash which then start to mingle switches - maybe I'm 
not understanding it right but thats what it seems - its all wired  
according to spec though, so that is what I suspected - with the additional 
grounding of a wire (short circuit-ing) It was using more power, but not 
enough to blow - when the extra load was being drawn - something goes out? 
Any way, so much for theories...check your relays...
