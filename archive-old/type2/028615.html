I found just such a tach. It fit just fine where the is
supposed to go, though I did have to fashion a clamp for it.

&gt; hey listees,
&gt; I need some VDO guages and am on a budget, so if anyone either has the

&gt; possibly a tach. Thanks

Go to a junkyard and scrounge around in the 80's rabbits, jettas, audi's
etc.

a lot of those cars came with VDO gagues (many calibrated for metric
though, degrees celsius, bar, etc VS psi degrees fareheit..)

Cheap and good... standard size, standard mounting configuration.

Never seen a tach like that though... but i guess if you found an
instrument cluster from a 4 cyl VW you could cut the tach out and make it
fit in a bay cluster...

take care,

Steve
