Subject: Re: [T2] 1973 Speedometer/odometer R&amp;R

&gt; To reassemble, I had to feed the screw in through the
&gt; front, then reach up from behind with the spring
&gt; clip and drive the screw into it.  I must be missing
&gt; something obvious here because it seemed much more
&gt; difficult than necessary.

The trick is that you feed the screws into the clips while the
instrument cluster is out.  Then when you push the cluster in place,
the clips snap into place and you can tighten up the screws.
