Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Corvair spark plug seals

[...]
They will work on type4 engine tin, but they are a
bear to get seated.
On cyls #1 and #3, the plug boot is not long enough
(by about 1/8&quot;&quot;) to extend up through the hole in the
tin, but if you are determined, you can get the seals
to seat.

Bug pack sells the exact same part.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi List,
&gt; &gt;         I have read that Corvair spark-plug
&gt; air-seals are &quot;better&quot; than
&gt; &gt; &gt;original VW style ones.  Where does one go about
&gt; purchasing them?
