Subject: Vanagon Engine Wiring Harness Wanted

	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi All!

I'm in the process of putting my engine back together for &quot;Blue Eyes&quot; =
and have decided that the wiring harness in the engine compartment is so =
burnt and has suffered through so many mouse attacks that it would be =
easier to get a replacement than fix this one.  Does anyone have one for =
sale?  My Westy is an 82 model.

Thanks,
Erich
