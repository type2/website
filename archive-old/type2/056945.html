Subject: What's up w/ my generator?

Hey Kids-
My generator light('70 Westy) has been going on and off for a few
days. When it's on I would push the brushes in and the light would go
off. I replaced the brushes yesterday and the light went out. After
driving about ten miles I went back to the engine(still running) and
found that they were making all kinds of nifty sparks and lights. I
killed the ignition(pulled the key out) and the idiot light came on.
Confused... I turned the bus back on and the idiot light now stays on.
I don't have any electrical testing goodies with me, so I'm looking
for a road diagnosis. Anyone?????
Thanks,
  -Kent
