Subject: Re: [T2] 914 tranny in a Bus?

The 914 tranny turns backwards because the engine is mounted in front of
the tranny.  Also, the 914 tranny is a side shift, so unless you plan on
some serious time and money to develop a new shift linkage system for the
bus, you'll have to stick with the stock or modified bus tranny.


&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt;Since I do a fair amount of highway driving, I was thinking about installing
&gt;a custom low/high ratio 4-speed transmission or a custom 5-speed
&gt;transmission in my Bus so I can pull decent highway speeds without winding
&gt;out the engine too much.
&gt;
&gt;Then I got to thinking (always dangerous)...
&gt;
&gt;If the Type 4 engine really is the same unit that was used in the Porsche
&gt;914, then wouldn't the 914 5-speed transmission be a perfect fit?  I realize
&gt;that going to Porsche parts immediately doubles the price, but it might be
&gt;something worth researching.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any info.
&gt;
