&gt; Its not as simple as that.  The rubber isn't easy to get properly placed.
&gt; It takes a lot of tugging and banging.  I used my fist, and whacked a small
&gt; piece of plywood with a hammer.  Turns out, the windshield can take a decent
&gt; whacking.

You hit a $175 piece of glass with a hammer? Uhh...yeah.
