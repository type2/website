Subject: pop top

Gentlepersons-
                       OK, here's the story...Guy stops me in the parking lot 
of a lumber yard
and asks me if I wanna buy a pop top for my Bay. Mine's a very working class 
Bus and
I have no desire/need of one but I knew someone out there would so I took his 
phone #
973 - 731 - 3057. This is in Bloomfield, NJ...Close to NYC as a geographic 
location.
                       The guy's name is Don and although he wouldn't give me 
an actual price,
I have the feeling if you're close to the area and give him a ring, once you 
and he are at
the top's location, it can probably be had cheep.
                        Get in touch with him first, if you're interested and 
then me (note se-
quence!), and I'll try and look at it and tell you if it's in shape or not. I 
know how these
things can work out - So please, don't run me (or him) around...OK?
Tony in NJ
