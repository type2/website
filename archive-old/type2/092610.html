&gt;The reason i ask is because my local VW repairman has

&gt;customer's bus.  He showed me the head the other day
&gt;(dropped seat)  and its got air injection ports in it!
&gt;This makes it no older than 1974, right? If so, it
&gt;came off an 1800cc engine.

73 engines also came with air injection ports so it could have been either an 1800 or 1700 engine.  One port indicates a left 74 head while two ports indicates either a 73 head or a right 74 head.

&gt;Is there a difference in the volume of the chamber in
&gt;the 2L and 1800 heads?  

Don't know, sorry.

&gt;I know the rods and crank are
&gt;different (and would like to know how different), but
&gt;weren't the heads different too?

The 2L crankshaft has smaller rod journals and a 5mm longer stroke.  The 2L rods have smaller journals (to match the 2-liter crank) and do not have a &quot;bump&quot; on the small end.  The 2L heads have smaller valves than either the 1.7 or 1.8 heads and after 1978 the exhaust ports changed to rectangular rather than oval.
