Subject: Blue Wire to Alternator

Just got a new alternator. Auto parts people seemed confused as to whether
or not it needed to be 55 or 75 amps. I got a rebuilt 55 for my '78 2.0 L
Bus.  Looks the same as the one I took out.
My dash alternator light has never worked. I assumed it might have something
to do with the blue wire that comes out of the right rear wire cluster below
the regulator. The wire was cut and now just dangles. Is this the wire that
controls the dash light?If so, where does it connect to?
Thanks,
