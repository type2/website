Subject: Re: [T2] Belly pans?

Rick,

All of the T2's I have ever seen had them, unless someone forgot to put
them back on.  My 78 has one.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Somebody recently mentioned to me that he was looking for a belly pan for 
&gt; his bus. I, too, looked for such a thing when I first got mine, but was told 
&gt; by several mechanics that no such thing existed. This gentleman I've been 
&gt; talking to said he'd hear that &quot;68-72's had
&gt; &gt;them, but it might have been the '60-70's.&quot; He also said he'd heard that 
&gt; &gt;those belly pans had problems rusting. Does anybody else have some input on 
&gt; &gt;this? I'd love to get something under there to protect the mechanics of the 
&gt; &gt;bus, even if it would rust away itself.
