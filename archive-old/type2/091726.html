&lt;&lt; Folks,

I am getting ready to llok for a 3rd taillight to mount on my 78 std bus.

Anyone done this?  Got any favorite locations or sources that look good? &gt;&gt;

The local Pep Boys/R. &amp; S. Strauss/etc. usually have these things (next to
the pine tree air fresheners ;-)
Although, I always liked the light on my '52 Chevy pick up that came factory
with no turn signals and one tail light...A J. C. Whitney special - big and 
read
&quot;STOP&quot; when you hit the (inadequate) brakes...
