&gt;
&gt; I checked the Library and the Archive and can't find a definition for
&gt; &quot;FLAPS.&quot;  Is this a vendor name or a disparaging acronym like &quot;f#$% lame
&gt; auto parts store?&quot;  Thanks for continuing my education,
&gt;
Go to type 2 library, hit D, go to dictionary of terms and scroll down to
learn what all of the terms every one uses mean.

FLAPS - Friendly Local Auto Parts Store/Supplier/Source
