First things first, I am a newbie to the world of Type 2 buses so 
please be gentle.  I looked in the archives, but since I am not 100$ 
sure of the technical names for what I need I wasn't very successful 
in my searches.  If someone on the list could answer my question or at 
least tell me what to search for in the archives, I would appreciate 
it.

  My ex-girlfriend/roommate just bought a '71 Bus.  She got it for 
cheap and we knew it needed some work.  But, my father is very 
knowledgeable about cars in general and has quite a bit of VW (beetle) 
experience.

  Last weekend we were working on the rear brakes.  I will try to 
describe what we found wrong, but as I said before I am not sure of 
technical names of parts.

  We took the wheel off.  Then, there was a giant nut with a pin 
through it.  We took out the pin and un-screwed the nut.  When we did 
this we discovered that the part that the nut screws on to was 
stripped.  Not the nut itself, but the part it screws on to.  My 
father said it is called the &quot;Rear Outer Axle Shaft&quot;, but the local VW 
shop acts like they have no idea what that is when I mention it.  Or, 
they say that it isn't possible for that to happen.  But, I saw it, I 
know it is stripped.

  So we need to replace it.  What my father does not know is how 
difficult this is to remove and replace.  Is this something that my 
father and I can do at home?  Or should it be done in a shop?  Keep in 
mind my father is good with cars in general.  He figures that as long 
as no special equipment is needed he should be able to do it.

  Any help on this matter would be appreciated.  Right now the only 
thing holding the whell on is that pin.  Not very safe.

  Thanks,
  Brian Walz
