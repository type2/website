Check your air fuel ratio also.
At idle the amount of fuel required to lube the
valves maybe too low.
You'll know if this is the case if at start up the
problem doesn't occure
because the choke(carburated right?) starting
system is feeding your
intake and valve system with enough fuel to lube
the valves.

Let me know if this is the stuff.
