Subject: RE: [T2] Big clutch nightmare!!

&gt; I just finished installing my rebuilt AVP 2000cc engine in my 72 Westy. On
&gt; the suggestion of GoWesty I went with the bigger clutch AND flywheel, the
&gt; 228mm.
&gt;
&gt; Well now I am trying to start my engine for the first time and the starter
&gt; &quot;fires&quot; but it won't engage or turn the engine. The engine went in fine.


Unfortunately, you got bad advice. You must use the correct clutch and
flywheel for your bellhousing.  You'll either have to go back to a 210mm
clutch and flywheel, or find a '76-79 trans or bellhousing.  If there is
another solution I am not aware of it.
