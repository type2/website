Subject: Re: [T2] Trying to understand about that part...

&gt; I now know what part you are talking about. it's the Decel Valve. My
 limited understanding of the Decel valve is that it simply helps your
 engine use less fuel when coasting or decelerating by providing a path
 for the air to go.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The decel valve opens at high vacuum conditions to allow air into the engine bypassing the throttle plate.
When you decelerate: the rpms are still high, the injectors are still injecting, but no air is getting past
the closed throttle plate. This give you an overrich condition. So the decel valve opens to allow air in to
complete the burn.
The top section here shows the most common decel valve:
  http://www.bug-bits.freeserve.co_dot_uk/ramva/fiche/t201810.gif
Tube 46 goes to the left rear of the plenum. Tube 47 comes from the fresh air side of the AFM. 5 is the decel
valve. The spring in the valve normally holds the valve closed so there is no flow between the two lines. When
high manifold vacuum overcomes the spring [on the little nipple on the right side], the plate inside opens
both ports and air flows.

Dan, you need to buy a 68-79 Bentley and do the tests in the last section. Your mechanic is a little wrong in
his tests/descriptions. The decel valve has no fuel going thru it. When it goes bad, it usually makes the idle
crappy because you are getting false air bypassing the AFM and the engine is too lean.
