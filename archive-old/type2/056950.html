Subject: Pandora on the Road: Hostelry Requested

Unless something goes badly wrong we'll be going to Chip Shaner's house,
replace Pandora's rear wheel cylinders, then drive her home this weekend.
&quot;We&quot; being me, the Cruise Director and Glen William at 16 months.

I'm having sporadic trouble with the 68, goes spontaneously dead sometimes,
seems to be a fuel delivery problem. I have been doggedly eliminating
variables for days but it only happens about once per day so diagnosis
takes a while. Tomorrow I'll rebuild the carb, if that doesn't work then
Friday I'll pull the tank and slosh it out. A chunk of crap in the tank
that occasionally floats its way into the oulet can cause the most
frustrating erratica as many of you know...

But we're still taking the 68 because that is the right way to do this.

Anyway I could sure use phone numbers and friendlies along the way. The
route per mapquest_dot_com is appended.

When I get back I shall post the most extensive and florid and masturbatory
of trip reports and those who object will be sent extra complimentary
copies.
