Subject: [T2] Transporter control or cruise control?

&gt;&gt; That is such a good idea, though.  I love that I could use my heater
levers for something (my friends refer to them as &quot;flap settings&quot; like on an
old airplane).  &lt;&lt;

When I was a kid we had a 73.  I thought VW called these vehicles
&quot;Transporters&quot; because the heat/air controls were patterned after the
Starship Enterprise's transporter controls.

Beam me up, Scotty,
