Subject: California Exhaust for sale

I am taking offers for a complete california exhaust
system from an 83 aircooled california vanagon 2.0L
not including the right heat exchanger but including
the left pipes off of the manifold are included. 
Highest bidder gets it and pays shipping, i pulled it
off of my vanagon and went to a 72-74 exhaust so it is
still in good condition.

=====
Keep it positive
