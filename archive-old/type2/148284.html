Subject: Re: [T2] Parcel Trays

A friend of mine got a broken leg in the front seat in a bus accident.
She is still an avid bus pilot though.

 Depends on the height of the hit- the post 72 busses have a giant &quot;tube&quot;
 welded across the body frame that holds the bumper.  This and the nature
 of the front beam and the longitudinal beams it hits means your floor
 doesn't give that much in a crash with  another car or a pole as with
 earlier busses.  I've seen this tube absorb the hit and crumple inwards,
 leaving the floor unbuckled.  .  However, if you hit a cow, the higher
 body mass may mostly push above the floor and really cave in the weaker
 nose- but the pics I've seen of the cow hit (was around 40 mph) did not
 really go in far enough to damage the driver (if no trays were there)-
 but then a cow weighs less than another vehicle?
