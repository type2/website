Subject: VWs in the UK (its clara here)

                        
hi y'all    im borrowing a friends machine to send this

funny thing about england is its reletive lack of vws.  but wierdly enough,
there are more here than i thought, or noticed when ive been here before.
but ive only seen 2 pre 68s, a bug in the airport parking lot, and a red
splittie on the road from cambridge.

seems like half the buses are pop top campers thiough, and people call all
the buses dormobiles, regardless of whether they were altered by the
dormobile company or not

but I SAW A BRASILIA BUS TODAY!!!  it was rusty.    had the corners windows,
63 type rear hatch with the indentation in it, drum brakes, high hinge cargo
doors with the rear door having the barndoor style door latch, and the 73-79
style front.   the pop out windows open like the way im used to, not from
the bottom. definately strange to my eyes.  i stood and googled at it for a
while.

any way, sad to be missing the list gossip, but ill be signed on again in 2
or 3 weeks
