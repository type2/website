Subject: thread pitch

Sorry,
the 1.5 indicates milimeters per thread, not threads
per millimeter. It's just backwards from the SAE spec,
which is threads per inch.

&gt; Can somone tell me what size\pitch\thread is for the
&gt; engine mounting nuts (that attach the tranny to the
&gt; engine case). The 17mm is obvious,

&gt;&gt;You mean the M10x1.5 that take a 17mm wrench
&gt;&gt;that translates to:
&gt;&gt;M is for metric
&gt;&gt;10 is 10 millimeter diameter
&gt;&gt;x1.5 is 1.5 threads per millimeter
