Subject: Re: Mechanical Ignition Switch - Rekey - and another couple
  questions ...

Where are you located? I have a complete column out of a 79 bus -
including the ignition key. I am in suburban Maryland, just outside of
Washington, DC.

I just shipped over my 74 Camper from Germany and noticed that I did
not bring my spare with me. Anyone around DC who has a spare decent
wheel (i.e. rim and 185R14C tire) they would want to part with?

2nd question (may be I should have labeled this brake booster blues): I
swapped my brake booster about 2 years ago, because it would not release
the brakes. Turned out that the old one had plenty of water inside. This
spring the new one started acting up: on occasion the brake pedal would
only come back up very slowly. I pulled the hose and could actually
siphon some water out - about 2 months ago. In the meantime I had the
car shipped to the US and it sat in the port for a while. Now my brake
pedal is way too firm and when I step on it the car will brake very
hard. Also, the pedal is coming up very slowly - if at all.
I know that I will need a brake booster rebuild - but what is causing
it? It's not the MC. I replaced it originally with a new one before the
brake booster swap and the old one turned out to be fine. I would hate
to spend the money on a rebuild knowing that my bus will eat up this
booster, too ...

Best,
Marcus
