&gt; After purchasing a 74 Westy this weekend, and after a long trip to

&gt; It is has an automatic transmission, and it operated just fine when I
&gt; took it for a test drive, in Sioux Falls South Dakota, however, the
&gt; closer I got to to home,
&gt; (Chicago) the sloppier the 2--3 shift became.
&gt; It is now slipping pretty bad, unless I get off the throttle, when it is
&gt; time for it to shift, or let it wind out in first and then slip my foot
&gt; off the pedal and then get back on it, and it will go right to third.

the 74 auto is a vacuum shift tranny, sounds like the vacuum line has
developed a leak somewhere, replace that vacuum line, if you still have a
problem

&gt; Is there a governor adjustment?

yes there is a governor adj, info on how to do it is in the Bentley
manual, but since it was working fine earlier I would be reluctant to
touch the gov.

be sure and drain the fluid and clean the filter, again step by step in
the Bentley manual
