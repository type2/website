&gt; I believe B1 bombers and possibly other military aircraft fill their tires

Some race cars use nitrogen filled tires because of the high
temps generated by racing stresses...A racer wants consis-
tency throughout the race so he/she (Right, Danica...?-)
can predict the car's performance...
BTW, when is Tampa, Florida moving/changing its name
to Hampton, Virginia... ?-)
