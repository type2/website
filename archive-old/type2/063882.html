Subject: How do I get Digest Mode?

I'm back from the &quot;Top of the World Tour&quot; to Inuvik, NWT
and find 2,200+ messages in my inbox.  Good grief!

At the same time the V_at_L list split, my system configuration
went haywire and was off the air for few days.  If a message
was ever sent on how to use the majordomo or listserv for the
Type2 list I never received it properly.


What's the secret password to set this thing into Digest Mode?

Thanks,
