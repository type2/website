&gt; As I have said before, it's remarkable how flexible the law can be.  It is
&gt; quite common to have an entire new antique airplane built around an old
&gt; data plate (the aircraft equivelent of a VIN).  The new airplane shares
&gt; absolutely _no_ parts with the airplane that the data plate came from, yet
&gt; it is perfectly legal as long as it conforms to the original design.  The
&gt; same obviously doesn't apply to cars!
