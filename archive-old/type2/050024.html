Subject: [T2] BBB V rv parking

A lot of inquiries on non VW rv parking have been coming in from list
members, so here's the scoop.

Crazy horse Camp-grounds (show site) has full RV hook-ups available, when
entering the camp-ground for BBB V just tell them you are coming to BBB V
and they will park you at the closet full hook-up to the show site. If you
don't need full hook-ups, there will be RV parking near the stage, next to
the show site. We have room for at least 400 plus buses and there should be
no problem with close in RV parking.
