Subject: Subaru --&gt; Type II ...Part 2 of 4 

Disclaimer:  I am going to leave out a few actual dimensions on this
one...mainly because it's hard to verbally describe a blueprint.  Also
because I haven't yet checked to see if the 1800 crank bolt pattern is the
same as my 1600.  (Been too busy trying to figure out the new turbo and fuel
injection)  All the dimensions for this part are easy to obtain by measuring
the your Subaru crank.  If anyone needs actual real numbers, I'll get them
(I've got to do it eventually).  This text is more of a 'procedure' for
accomplishing the retrofit.  Once again, the #1 feature that you are dealing
with is:

 1.) Distance from transaxle locating face of bell housing to clutch disk
surface of flywheel. This can be easily measured on a VW engine with
flywheel installed.

O.K....you've had all kinds of time to complete the 1st part.  You've
probably already polished your new bell housing adapter and sent it out to
be rainbow anodized.  The rest of the adapter isn't as labor or money
intensive as the last, howver, a little more machining is involved, so I
hope your machinist is not too pissed off after the 'bell housing project'.

Part 2: Modification of flywheel &amp; Fabrication of pilot bushing retainer.

Needed:
1.)     Flywheel * 
2.)     Mild steel plate long enough to span 2 Subaru flywheel bolts
opposite each other, at least as thick as your VW flywheel center hub. ***
3.)     Machinist to bore the center of your VW flywheel.
4.)     Oilite bronze bushing 3/4 O.D. X 1/2 I.D. X about 3/4 long.   ***

*  I used a 200mm 6 volt flywheel.  I like the 6 volt starters.  Between  my
63 &amp; 64 I've gone through 3 starters in 20 years running on 12 volt systems.

*** There may be a simple way around the entire bushing retainer on the
1800cc.  The bearing retainer described is needed for the 1600cc.

The VW flywheel locates with 4 dowel pins.  It fastens with a 'gland nut'.
The Subaru flywheel locates with a 'bore' over a hub on the crank.  It
fastens with 8 bolts.

You are going to modify the VW flywheel so that it locates over the hub on
the crank, and fastens with 8 bolts.

With the VW flywheel on a VW engine, note where the pilot shaft bearing (in
the Gland Nut) is in relation to the flywheel clutch surface (your main
reference for all of this part).  With your new setup you have no Gland nut,
no needle bearing.  You have to have a bearing or bushing at this 'location'.

You are going to fabricate/machine a 'retainer' to hold a bushing at the
position of the current needle bearing.

A.      Modifying the flywheel...the machining part

Notice that the Subaru flywheel has a 'flat' face that attaches to the
crank.  The VW flywheel  has a 'flange' for sealing around the outside of
the crank, using an o'ring or gasket.  This 'flange' has to go away.

Clamp the flywheel to the mill table, resting on some 1-2-3 blocks under the
clutch disk surface.  The crank side is up.  Mill the flange flush with the
center surface of the flywheel.  Install for dowels into flywheel.  Using a
dial indicator 'sweep' in the four pins to find 'center' of the flywheel.
If they are sloppy, sweep in the center  hole of the flywheel.  Bore open
the hole (not very much) to slip over the hub on the Subaru crank.

The next step should prefferably be done on a milling machine, but can be
done manually.

Flip the flywheel over.  If still on the mill, indicate in the center bore.
Measure the bolt pattern on a Subaru flywheel or the Subaru crank for the 8
bolts.  Notice that 2 holes are spaced further apart than the rest.  If on
the mill, calculate the bolt pattern and drill.  Counter bore the holes (big
enough for the washers on the Subaru crank bolts) flush with the center
surface of the flywheel.

If doing the hole pattern by hand, center the Subaru flywheel over the VW
flywheel.  You might want make a simple alignment tool thru the center
bores.  Transfer punch, drill, and counterbore the holes using the Subaru
flywheel as a template.


B.      Fabrication of pilot bushing retainer...1600cc.  (***may be a
simpler way 1800cc)

Without showing you a blueprint, all I can do is describe what you need to
make.  Look at the output shaft on your transaxle.  Notice that after the
'bullet' end of the shaft, there is the part of the shaft that runs in the
VW gland nut needle bearing.  There is more available shaft before you get
to the splines.  
The retainer that you need to fabricate attaches to at least 2 flywheel
bolts.  It uses the space from within your flywheel almost out to the clutch
disk. (Lay the clutch disk in place and see how much space you have).  The
retainer is bored out for a std. 3/4 bushing.  The bushing needs to be bored
for a slip fit for the output shaft.  The bushing will ride on the shaft
back closer to the splines than the original gland nut bearing.

On the 1600 engine, the needle bearing in the end of the crank must be
removed.  If you can't get it out, use a 5/8 drill, (that you dont mind
chewing up a little) to remove it.

The 1800 crank has clearance for the nose of the shaft.

***simpler way...maybe

The Subaru 1800 flywheel has a 'bearing pressed into it.  There probably is
a standard metric bearing which has the correct I.D. for the VW output
shaft.bearing.  I don't think the VW flywheel has enough meat for locating
on the crank and retaining a bearing but I will reseach this A.S.A.P.


Install the modified VW flywheel onto the Subaru engine with your rainbow
anodized bell housing in place.  Measure from the transaxle locating surface
to the clutch disk surface and make sure it matches the VW engine you have
setting around.  If it does, then your ready to bolt up and see if it cranks
over.

Next step:....(no more machining!!).....Cooling system side-hinged decklid.
fabrication:
