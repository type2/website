Subject: Re: [T2] Covair Conversions

&gt;Whether I build a nice bulletproof Type IV engine making  100 HP per the 
&gt;Raby recipe or a &quot;standard&quot; Corvair 140 HP - the price is the same - more 
&gt;or less. The Corvair is said (by the Corvair people) to be a bulletproof 
&gt;engine . Check back with me in 30K miles and I'll tell you if I agree.

That statement was a bit misleading. I don't mean to say that the Corvair 
as expensive to rebuild to basic factory specs as a performance VW Type IV.

Depends on what you want to spend. I got my engine for $150 with tranny. 
Pit Stop has whole long blocks used for $300-$500. I don't know what you 
get with that... However you can do a nice rebuild yourself for similar to 
a VW Type IV engine I think. Just shop around.
