Subject: Structural/Frame diagrams for Bay Bus/DC/SC?

Would anyone have any idea of where I could find/buy diagrams/sectional
drawings of '72 on Baywindows (Type2b) which show the framework/structural
members, and dimensions if possible (particularly Single Cab &amp; Double Cab
trucks, but anything would be a help)?

I'm getting close(r) to actually starting my Bay truck project, and one
thing which will create a problem, is that I haven't been able to find any
diagrams which show the structural members of the later trucks. ( Grafting a
Single Cab Bed onto a Double Cab will need the addition of reinforcing
framework, and I'd REALLY like to start planning from diagrams, rather than
just chopping two in half, and then sorting out where the reinforcing
framework can go with a &quot;hands-on&quot; approach. )

Any information and/or assistance would be GREATLY appreciated.

Thanking you in anticipation.
