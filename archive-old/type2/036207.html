Subject: No Brake Fluid.

I have recently put a new master cylinder in my bus, thinking that it was the 
problem.   After the brakes were to the point of needing attention I went to 
adjust and bleed but found that no fluid was coming out of any of the bleeder 
screws.  Even when I completely remove the tiny screw and my friend pumps the 
brakes no fluid is coming out!  I knew the brakes were needing attention, as 
this was the first time I really took a look at them.  The bleeder valve on 
the master works great and I get a steady stream every time.  Wheel 
cylinders?  Brake lines?

Thanks,
    Dan in Reno
