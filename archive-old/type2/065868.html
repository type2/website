Tom , 

 Sometimes in the search for a new engine its easier to get a bug motor
(because there are more bugs than buses out there), so you can buy or ,make
&quot;bus hangers&quot; as their called, to make a bug motor that doesn't have the 
extra holes in the case(by the way some times it's better to get a bug motor
than a generic bus case, I think they are cast better than generic cases)
I bought a bus hanger and have had a t3 motor in my car for a year now 
and it seems to work fine,......
