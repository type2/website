Subject: Re-keying locks, or, So many locks so few keys
Message-ID: &lt;371218A0.95EACEF4_at_escape_dot_ca&gt;

To the person who re-keyed thier own locks and  had information on how
to go about re-keying locks.

Sorry, but I deleted your message before I noted your name - anyway -
any info anyone has as to making all my locks fit one key would be
appreciated.

thanks
