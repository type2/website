My tail pipe has been looking kinda sooty lately, so it was not surprising
to me when I got my pre-test and it showed 7% CO (limit 3%, normal is 1%) and
my Hydrocarbons (HC) at 550 ppm (limit 250, normal 70) at idle. The readings at
2500 rpm were within passable limits. Getting a pre-test is important because
if your emissions are really bad and that data gets sent to DMV, you get tagged as
a gross poluter which then involves increased hassles to get legal. The pre-test
just lets you know what your emissions are without sending the data to DMV.

I did a compression test a while ago which showed cylinders 1 and 3 at 90 psi
and the others at 130 psi. I put oil in the low cylinders and the compression
came back up. Diagnosis: Warn rings. Since the bus runs so nicely I do not want
to replace my engine now. I was concerned that incomplete combustion caused by
the low compression on the two cylinders would make it impossible to pass smog.
Talking with a couple of mechanics confirmed my fears.

I performed a tune-up with new plugs (NGK) and cap and rotor. I didn't change
my points because I switched to a compufire module some time ago.

I took the bus to visit my mechanic who I have known for many years and who I
consider a friend (Lou's VW in Reseda, CA). Lou let me use his exhaust gas 
machine to adjust the idle mixture. I measured the exhaust before the CAT and
managed to adjust my CO down to 1% - it took a whole bunch of turns on the idle
mixture screw. This also brought down my HC to 450 ppm which is still almost
double the limit.

After adjusting the idle CO, I measured the emissions after the CAT. Surprisingly,
the HC was the same or worse than before the CAT. Diagnosis: The CAT isn't doing 
anything.

I went to a local place and had a new CAT welded on. The mechanic told me that
catalytic converters last about 70,000 miles. My odometer shows 80,000 which is
either 180,000, 280,000 or 380,000. He said I was still using the original CAT.

After replacement, I went back to Lou's and measured the emissions. At first I 
thought that the exhaust gas machine was broken - it showed zero HC. The machine
wasn't broken - it actually showed that the new CAT reduced my HC from 450 ppm
to zero.

It is my understanding that a properly tuned bus (with good compression, etc.)
should get under the 250 ppm HC without CAT, but if it has some kind of problem,
then it is going to need the CAT to get under this limit.

For anyone whose bus is getting 400-500 ppm of HC before the CAT and above limit
after the CAT, replacing the CAT may be all that you need to do.

The other issue with passing smog is the leaded fill pipe restrictor which
stops you from putting leaded gas into the tank. As some have noted, you cannot
even buy leaded gas anymore, but this does not change the requirement.

I learned from Jack Stafford, fellow listee, that there is a device available
from FLAPS (in the gas cap section) which you stick into the fuel filler pipe. 
This device consists of a metal plate with barbed spikes around it. The barbed
spikes keep it stuck in your metal fuel filler pipe. In the middle of the plate
is hole that is the right size for an unleaded nozzle and the hole is covered 
by a spring loaded door. The problem is a '78 bus doesn't have a metal fuel 
filler pipe, it has a rubber one which would not appreciate sharp metal barbs.

Here's what I did: I removed gas cap and the plate the gas cap attachs to. This
removes with four easy screws. Then I placed the barbed restrictor thingy right
inside and put everything back together. Since I didn't ram the restrictor into
the rubber hose, it didn't do any damage. I don't think this would be functional
since it isn't far enough inside, but that didn't matter since I took it out
right after the smog check. FWIW - On the print out, it showed Fuel Restrictor
N/A - so perhaps the state is not checking for it anymore. YMMV.

BTW - At the smog station, my bus blew 14 ppm of HC and 0% CO at idle. Amazing
that my 22 year old bus is running as clean as a brand new car!
