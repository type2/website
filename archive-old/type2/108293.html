&gt; The  heads still has the &quot;head gaskets&quot; in 'em.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone had any problem lately with leaving these out &amp; using the
barrel
&gt; shims?

Volkwagon made this recommendation at some point.  See
http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/techbull.html

&gt; I found on the case behind the flywheel what looks to me to be a
crankshaft
&gt; sensor.
&gt; Of course the PO had neatly cut the wire off.
&gt;
&gt; Could someone tell me how this could be running w/o the wire connected?

It's only a diagnostic sensor, has nothing to do with the normal operation
of the engine.
