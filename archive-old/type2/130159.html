Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Question

MP3/DVD/DVX Entertainment center ... never leave home without it, 
always have it running when on the road and certainly wouldn't leave it 
in the bus if I sold it as its worth more than the bus &lt;grin&gt;.

Wait, actually I would say my feeler gauge(s), who would want their 
points to close and not have their feeler.

&gt; What's your favorite bus accessory? The one thing you would never 
&gt; leave home without, and you would never leave in the bus if you ever 
&gt; had to sell it.
