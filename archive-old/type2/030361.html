Roy,

There are a number of possible causes for your problem.  From easy and
cheap to expensive they are:

Loose engine/trans fasteners - there are two nuts on studs under the
engine and 2 nuts on bolts over the engine.  If they are not tight, the
engine/trans can move in relation to each other

Insufficient arch in the boudin tube - as the clutch cable approaches the
trans, it comes out of the metal guide from the front and into a plastic
tube.  this plastic tube *must* have an arch in it, I beleive slightly
more thna an inch.  The amount is regulated by adding washers under the
mount on the trans (note that the mount sometimes comes loose as well,
check it)

Broken mounts - there are *5* rubber mounting blocks that need
inspection/replacement.  Two at the rear of the engine on the bearer bar,
one at the front of the trans and two over the trans on the trans
hanger. (the two over the trans are present on 79-79 buses, but not on
earlier models)

Oil on the clutch disk - pull and replace.  You will also have to replace
the leaking seals if you want this to last more than 50 miles :-(
