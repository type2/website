Subject: Busses By The Arch #11

Busses by the Arch is a fantastic, friendly camping event held twice
a year near St. Louis MO. The next one is over the Labor Day
Weekend, August 30-Sept 1. Bill Bowman, who organizes BBTA, asked me to
post some information, details and directions to the campground, so I
put some stuff up on my home VW page,
http://pwp_dot_usa.pipeline_dot_com/~tforhan/swhome.htm with links to more.

We attended this last year, and it was great, the central US location
really makes it possible for anyone who is bus crazy to attend. Last
year's &quot;Greatest Distance&quot; vehicle came from Oregon. While I have
no interest, I strongly encourage everyone to go for it!  It is
sponsored by both LIMBO and NEATO, so you can expect to see everything
from splitties to Eurovans. All VWs are welcome, BTW, even non Buses.

Tom F.
