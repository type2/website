Subject: Air Induction  or  Blower ???

Maybe this is a question for Friday or a good way to get the blood flowing
into the brain. But, anyway.

 

The Question of the day ? Can you add air induction or a blower to a late
model e.g. 71-79 bus that is carbed ?

 

We have torn apart a rear section out of a 77 to explore dividing the cool
air duck on both sides and see

If there is enough room to maybe weld in a flange to divert part of the
airflow down a separate duct leading into a hose attached to a air cleaner
box and then into the carb with a choked style lever to control air out of
the box ? Or using the factory VW heater lower and modifying it to accept
the cool air from the duct work and then into the carb ?

 

This is probably a great question for all those that have installed a turbo
into their bus.

 

My application would be on a 1976  Bus with a 2275 engine with dual carbs
with a modified and beefed up 091 tranny.

 

Thanks for all your info and advice.. thanks
