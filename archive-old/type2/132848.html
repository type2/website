&gt; Now to see if there are still some available somewhere (as RAtwell
&gt; mentioned).

Sent my other reply too quickly. This page lists the 80-2220 (rear) as
still available as a special order unit from dealers. It's the 2004
application guide direct from Koni so I guess they'd know &lt;grin&gt;. 

http://www.koni-na_dot_com/pdfcatalogs/2004applguide.pdf

It also says front (80-1349) and rear (80-1350) for 55-67 are still
available.

The .pdf locked up my IE browser a couple of times. Lots of graphics and
maybe some active links or something. You may want to download and save it
to your hard drive for direct viewing with Acrobat reader (that seems to be
working OK --- time for a fresh spyware/adware scan &lt;sigh&gt;).

The link can be located in IE (so you can right-click/save-as) by searching
google_dot_com for &quot;koni 80-2220&quot;
