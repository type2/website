Hello all,

&gt; imported german 2litre with hydraulic lifters with 20,000 miles on it so 
&gt; far.

just some calrification:

if it is in fact a German market 2L it  does NOT have hydraulic lifters.
For those who are interested, here are some German engine codes:
AP 1.8L dual carb rated at 68 (DIN: German) hp
AT 1.8L dual carb 411/412 rated at 75 (DIN) hp
CJ 2L dual carb rated at 70 (DIN) hp
CU 2L dual carb Vanagon rated at 70 hp (may have hydraulic lifters!? I don't know - never had one(
GB 2L dual carb Porsche 914 rated at 100hp

BTW, if it has FI it is definitely an American market engine.

Cheers,
Marcus

74 Westfalia Offenbach with 110 hp Kummetat engine (CJ case with AT heads and GB P&amp;Cs ...)
