Volks,

I am sorry to say that I just found a *raft* of mail that has been blocked
by the list software.  I *think* I have corrected the problem and if you
see a maderately sever tidal wave of posts in the next hour with dates
goign back to friday, that is the cause. :-(

                           H Steven Dolan
