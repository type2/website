Subject: will 091-301-103 trans work on 75 &amp; how to judge it out of bus?

Speaking of 75 bus and trans that will work, I finally am getting a good
title on the 75 bus that's been mothballing (long story, PO gave me
original
title, but I didn't know he had gotten a duplicate which supercedes
original?  Dup lost, so I had to track him down and have him get another
dupe!
   Anyway, the trans has no 2nd gear, I see 3 ribs on it, and I got a
spare
from Ron Salmon that apparently is for a 77-78, with #091-301-103 on
it.  No
idea of milage, but no leaking and diff is tight and shift rod bushing
is
tight compared to a sloppy 204K 77 trans I pulled.
   Later I got a 76 parts bus with 120K on the trans, also tight but
slight
bushing play and some weepage.   Same part number on the trans.   Seems
I
have a surplus of later trannies; will save one for the 230K Westy, but
gotta decide on the 75 bus- will the 103 work or be too tall?
If I want to put a later engine in (I have a working 77 that's
rebuildable)
how does one deal with the FI differences like Air Flow Meter (later has
one
more contact in harness)?  I'm reluctant, as the 75 has only about 65K
on
the engine.    MB
