Subject: Re: [T2] Finally got affordable insurance!  Woo hoo!



&gt; &gt;I finally found a sweet deal through AAA Auto Club... I took out a new policy
&gt; &gt;with them today that provides the same coverage on both of my vehicles for
&gt; &gt;*half* of what I had been paying Allstate *before* their attempt to raise my
&gt; &gt;rates 43%... overall I stand to save at least $1,200 - $1,300 over the next
&gt; &gt;year compared to what those extortionists wanted to continue my coverage...

Proof that it pays to shop around, and that one person's &quot;sweet deal&quot; may
not work for another.  I shopped around as well, and AAA was far from the
lowest rate in my vicinity for the coverage I wanted.

George
