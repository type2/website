Subject: Re: [T2] vredenstien tyres

Here we go AGAIN!!   185/75R14 are the WRONG size. The correct tire size DOES
NOT have an aspect number in the middle.

This is my last reply to ANY tire post/question. They come up every other week
and the same questions are asked and the same answers are given. Does everyone
have totally selective reading habits????
As far as I am concerned, if the tire is round and holds air: Use it, you are
going to anyway. You guys buy 1st and then ask questions and then try to
rational your bad purchase.
Knowledge is power.  ASK FIRST.


&gt; notes on the tire are
&gt;
&gt; 185/75R14 C
&gt; Transport Steel P75
&gt; 102/100P
&gt; made in Holland
&gt; LT Load Range D
&gt; 1875 lbs at 65 psi single
&gt; 1765 lbs at 65 psi dual
&gt; Wasnt really happy about what i was finding available and decided there
&gt; had to be more out there.  Tires Plus store manager up the street from
&gt; me called their denver warehouse and found out about these tires.  He
&gt; didnt remember who, but evidently they are OEM on some RV  sold  in the
&gt; US.

&gt; &gt; Sounds like a 185R14C LRD tire then.  Wow, that's an impulse buy.  Glad
&gt; &gt; they
&gt; &gt; worked out.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What is the load range and max psi marked on the sidewall?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, what chain carried them?
