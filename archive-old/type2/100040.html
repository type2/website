&gt; A buyer is planning on bringing my bus back from Canada to his home in
&gt; California. 
&gt; 
&gt; I was curious whether anyone has done this routine before? I am wondering
&gt; primarily about what happens at the border. Do I need to fill out any
&gt; forms/alert customs/etc? Can he just drive my bus over the border and home
&gt; to California, and then register?

Is this your 71 Westy? Is he the legal owner now?

Basically he will show up at the border with his new vehicle and declare
that he wishes to import it.

Although the literature says do it at the border, Canadians including myself
have brought in Canadian vehicles without any paperwork even though we said
we were moving to the US and had other paperwork (visas, etc).  Saying you
are a visitor will not be a problem obviously but I have no idea what
they'll do if you are a US citizen with Canadian plates.

If he chooses not to import and the border and makes it through customs
unscathed, he can still go to any local customs office that performs this
function (usually near an air or sea port) but I would do it at the border:
if there are any problems it's better to be able to resolve the issues in
Canada than be in illegal status here in the US because he won't be able to
legally title, register or sell the vehicle while in the US.

Further, local US Customs in CA may be more strict about importing vehicles
especially for use in CA than at the Canadian border (not knowing what state
you'll eventually end up in).

&gt; If anyone has border-specific info on the transfer from Canada to the US,
&gt; it would help greatly!

Read here:

http://www.nhtsa.dot_dot_gov/cars/rules/import/

The customs officer will fill out an HS-7 Declaration Form and the buyer
will either declare that the vehicle is 25 years or older (model year, not
year of manufacture) or will need provide a letter from VW that says it's
the equivalent of a US version for that model year. Until January, vehicles
made in 1977 vehicles are 25 years or old.

For the letter, contact VWoA Customer Service (not in Canada) and with a
model description and VIN they will generate a certificate of compliance.
This letter will describe what is different from a US model.  It may say:

- meets all CMVSS and FMVSS (safety standards)
- speedo must be capable of being read in MPH
- odometer must be labeled
- brake warning light must be marked in BRAKE in letters 1/8&quot; high (I've
never seen a US model with this so it may be a mistake on VW's part).

If he is lucky he can make these changes himself and get an authorized VW
dealer to state it conforms.  Keep visiting dealers until he finds a nice
one.  I doubt any dealer is going to work on a vehicle this old even if he
provides the parts so do it, shut up, and just show them the form and they
will do an inspection that he can take to customs.

The letter will also state if the vehicle:

- meets EPA regulations
- meets CARB regulations

If he gets a certificate of non-compliance it will likely be for the EPA and
getting it up to US spec won't be worth the cost in most case as the people
who can legally do it are in the grey market euro sports car importing
business.

CARB is the harder part.  He should be able to import it at the border if
it's not CARB compliant on the letter but once he gets to CA only meeting
EPA may not be enough for CA. Tracing the vehicle origin to Canada may raise
their eyebrows compared to bringing in a Federal vehicle already registered
in another state to CA. I'm speculating at this point.

I've always wondering if a 79 vehicle made in Canada would be CARB approved
for 1979. I imported a 78 (24 years old) into another state where I live so
I didn't have a problem with CARB.

Email me off the list for specifics.
