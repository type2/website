&gt; I am trying to do a complete correct restoration of a '65 camper and would like
&gt; to find as many original parts as possible. To make this task easier it would be
&gt; helpful to have a list of part numbers to work from. Does anyone know where I
&gt; can find these numbers, a book or magazine or website, etc. Any help would be
&gt; VERY much appreciated. 

I have a '65 parts book, which I am playing with scanning the 
parts numbers and OCR'ing them.  I would also like to find a
machine-readable copy somewhere...

If I can't find a machine readable list, I'll prolly go ahead and
OCR the whole book...  Oye, what a job!
