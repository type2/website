Subject: removing slider sunroof pocket

I figure I can gain abou 3-4&quot; of headroom. I am
planning on installing a wood headliner also. The
sunroof pocket takes up a lot of space.. anyone
ever removed one or would the pocket be additional
structural support for the hole in the roof?
Any thoughts/musings welcome. I can work around it
I suppose. the slider is no longer a slider.

Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me What a long, strange trip it's been.
