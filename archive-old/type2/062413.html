Subject: Name your price!/Bus rescue mission (long)

Went Friday to look at a friend's bus...down a 5 mile driveway in NoWhere,
AR. Okay, actually, it was &quot;in the country&quot; near Snowball, AR (population 15
- -- when everyone's home). It was, in fact, a 5-mile long county road at the
end of which there is only one house with generator-supplied electricity and
no phone. My kinda place--a two-dog house! Anyway, we've been talking about
the possibility of me buying this camper for about a year now...and I've
just seen it. I'm interested, but I want to offer my friend a fair
price--not too much; not too little. I know how hard it is to price things
you haven't seen, but if you're up to the challenge, I'm still asking for
your opinion. Bottom line, if I don't rescue this bus, it will die a rusty
death in the back hills of Arkansas. I have a price in mind, but I'd like to
hear your ideas too.

General Info
- ------------

'67 Westy SO-42 interior

- - has track for awning (possibly a factory option?). 
- - last inspection in 1974, but it's over 25 miles to the nearest store, so
probably 50 to the nearest inspection station. I have a feeling you could
drive up here for 40 years without a license or registration.
- - complete, professional rebuild engine with less than 1000 miles on it (my
friend has about $400 in the rebuild, but the labor of a professional
machinist was free).
- - 56,000 total miles on the bus.
- - needs tires.
- - needs steering box and rebuild of steering control system.
- - needs rebuild of braking system.
- - original key and locks all work.
- - top faded and canvas needs replacement.

Body/Rustoration
- ----------------
The body has a few dents, which I can easily fix. Even the nose has only a
minor dent in it. I could find only one spot with bondo on the whole bus. It
was on the side of the passenger door; about the size of a dollar bill and
not more than 1/2 inch deep.

Surface rust on the nose and at a few scratched points.

Here comes the bad part &gt;&gt;&gt; The bus will require replacement of the front
floor and the floor section at the bay doors. The rocker for the bay doors
will also need to be replaced. I really didn't get to *crawl* under the bus,
but I *looked* and I wasn't 'affeared of what I seen.' Looks like all the
support arms are good. The back of the front wheel wells will need
rustoration, though I haven't seen a price on these panels...probably could
just use some good, straight metal. Battery tray needs replacing, but it's
not rusted to the seams, only in the middle. I'm guessing $350 in panels if
I buy them from Das Bulli Haas, which I would. The bottom of the bus was
covered with red dirt, so I can't really tell if there's hidden rust. I'll
assume there is some, but not too much--might be a costly assumption, but I
noticed undercoating, so I'm not too scared of it. Also, the bus has a
sticker on the back from a VW dealership in El Dorado, Arkansas, so it
probably hasn't seen salty roads.

Minor rust in the bottom of the passenger door. Pretty major rust at the
bottom of the rear bay door. Engine deck lid bent and hinges kinda sticky.
Otherwise, doors are fine.

The accessory tray up front has some rust on it from recent rain. It looks
in good shape, but will need removal and sandblasting. Dash looks good. No
holes or dents in it.

If it weren't for the rust on the floors, this bus would be a **perfect**
restoration candidate. Yes, the rust is due to leaky windows...or left-open
doors, but in fairness to my friend, it's probably happened since he's been
away from the bus...for the last 10 years or so.

Needs new window seals all around -- kinda goes without saying.

Standard six-window pattern with five louvred and one solid window.

No rust at the front windshields.

Paint faded enough to require complete repainting.

Windows
- -------
All glass in place. One star spot on the driver's side windshield. One of
the louvred windows needs to be replaced or repaired. (A tab at the bottom
of the window track broke, causing the glass to slip down.) All mechanisms
on louvred windows work fine. Front windows slide fine, lock, etc.

Interior
- --------

The interior seems complete (though I don't know where I'd look for a &quot;spice
rack&quot;; is that by the door? or is that the little closet in the back on the
driver's side?

It's got the 1/3 - 2/3 seat combo. The driver's side needs new upholstery.
The other side is fine.

No curtains, but tracks &amp; plastic dealies in place.

No spare tire behind seat.

No extra holes drilled anywhere on the inside or outside of the bus.

No radio.

One of the back seats needs fabric (only one hole) in it. Others okay.

The cooler has some warpage on it's top, but it's otherwise clean...as it
the rest of the cabinetry. I'd probably take the cooler to a ccabinet maker
and have him repair it.

Door panels need replacement all around.

Power train
- -----------

I ran it and it sounded powerful...as VWs go. The guy who rebuilt it is a
machinist by trade and reputed to be a good one. I'll assume he did a fine
job on this motor, as it was built for his best friend. It's a '71 DP.
Didn't note the carb and distributor combination.

I think it's safe to assume that the tranny and reduction boxes are in good
shape. I am pretty sure this bus has only 56,000 miles on it's drive train.
I need to talk to my friend for confirmation. Due to serious difficulty
steering, I only drove the bus a couple hundred feet. First, second, and
reverse worked fine.

Instruments
- -----------

Gas gauge seems not to work, but could be *really* close to empty instead.

Alternator and Oil lights work.

Wipers work fine.

One tail light is out, but the fast flash of the turn signal on that side
makes me think it's a bulb.

After owning a '71, I like the simplicity of this wiring design!

Possible Accessories
- --------------------

may come with a 1/2 length roof rack with rotted wood (I say &quot;may&quot; because
this and the front bumper are currently with a guy who was going to do a
trade for the bus that fell through. He's supposedly an honest fellow,
though.). I think my friend has the poles for the awning too, but I'm not
positive.

So, the way it sits, it's missing the front bumper, the optional roof rack,
the awning, and also the sun visors and radio. That's all the bus is missing..

If you give me a price, I'd rather you figure it the way it sits. missing
bumper, etc.


More Details
- ------------

If you've made it this far, I'll clue you in on the M-Codes, etc.

Type 23-42
VIN #: 237038286

&gt;From M-Code Plate:

06 0
425 842 025 108 139
UK 2312 523907 70382 66

Thanks for your input! In the end, I'll do what I think is fair, but I'm
going to try to buy this bus and rustore it. No sense in trying to talk me
out of it. I'm an addict. Nothing you say will make me want to quit rusty
VWs...except, maybe the location of that mint 23-window or barndoor. ;) Joe
