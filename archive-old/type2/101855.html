Yow!  The pressures on the sidewall are the maximum
pressures.  If you run them you will wear out your tires in the centers
and suffer a harsh ride.


&gt; Any tire pressure that is given in the
&gt; manual was ment for the factory tires which I doubt
&gt; are still on your bus.

No, but if the tire size is the same, then the pressures in the manual or
on the data plate are far better than the maximums.  In most buses the
front wheels are more lightly loaded than the rears and need considerably
less pressure.  Load range D tires are rated for 60PSI, but there's no way
that you want to run that much on a bus!
