&gt; Joe Clark has the &quot;Definitive Type-II Tent&quot; page, and
&gt; he doesn't even sell them!!! He does it out of: a)
&gt; interest, b) passion, c) perversion, or some
&gt; combination of the above!

Mostly c), I think. ;-)

The one real disadvantage I've found to distributed resources is that
they tend to drop out from time to time.   For example, I &quot;took
advantage of the power of the web&quot; by just linking to some further tent
info at other sites, but some of them have vanished.  Link URLs change. 
A piece of info on a site that I consider crucial or just damn
fascinating may be yanked by the site owner for reasons unknown.  etc.
etc.

I agree in spirit with the web-ring concept, but it would at least need
some master index/search capability.  Something like ... the type2
library page.

My $0.02.
