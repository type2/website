Subject: Convertable console for walk-throughs

Friday topic: group design for a convertable console for walk-though 
buses. 

Design problem: Design an object that can hold two coffee mugs or cold 
drinks, cassette tapes, condo-hell's-gate transmitter, change for tolls, 
maps, snacks, camera,  and a pair of binoculars. Console must disappear 
whenever anyone wants to walk through the walk-through.

Suggestions:

(A) An all plywood or plywood-and-canvas equivalent of a pop-up book, 
with removable storage container. It should fold flat, no more than 2&quot; thick.

(B) A nylon case with pockets, etc. Supported by a steel wire rack (like 
the Primus rack for cookstoves). Ideally, nylon case converts into a small 
daypack and wire rack folds up to fit inside.

(C) A pure inflatable/deflatable.

Suggestions that anyone just put a cooler there and kick it around are 
disallowed.

Ready, set, ... charette.
