I see a new starter in your very near future. Yours sound like it's old and
sticky, a problem compounded by &quot;heat soak&quot; as we say in the trade. On
shutting down after a good run (50 miles is plenty) the heat from the
engine, having no motivation to go away any longer and being obedient to the
laws of thermodynamics and entropy - soaks into everything around it
including your starter.

You can check this by measuring the amperage the starter is using - check it
while cranking cold and then again when hot. My guess is you'll get a
reading noticeably higher when hot. Another possibility is voltage drop down
the length of the switch-to-solenoid wire. A quick test is to try jumpering
&gt;from the positive battery terminal on the solenoid to the switch wire
terminal when the starter is being recalcitrant (with the engine hot). If it
changes its tune and cranks the engine merrily, replace the wire. If it
still doesn't want to spin over, replace the starter. My money is on the
starter.

For grins, if you have more time than money or are cursed with obsessive
thrift  (or a lean pocketbook) you can try taking the starter and solenoid
apart and cleaning them thoroughly. Then install the solenoid plunger 180
degrees from its original position (turned around the long axis of the
plunger). We used to do this as a &quot;cheap&quot; fix for customers who were
strapped for cash... We don't do it anymore - the relatively low price of
rebuilt Bosch starters and the higher labor rate we have to charge makes
this kind of procedure no longer cost effective. Cheers!

This weekend I took my 72 campmobile on a medium length trip.  At our first
stop about 50 miles along, the motor would not turn over when I went to
start
it.  It was like the ground cable from the battery was bad(I just replaced
it
about a month ago).  We gave it a jump and went to a friendly place where it
did the same thing.  We charged the battery, checked connections, thought
everything was okay and headed off.  At the next gas stop, sure enough, same
thing.  Jumped it again and went to the store for a new battery, thinking
the
old one was bad.  Headed off for our destination and when we got there it
was
dead again.  This time we push started it and went to our camping spot.
When
we woke up this morning just for the fun of it I gave the key a turn.
Suprise, it started right away and has been fine all day.  I don't have a
clue!
