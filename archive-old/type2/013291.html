tom,
i was simply making the entire list aware of the
problem i had with my engine a couple weeks ago, and
now giving the list the answer AVP has given back.  i
am merely asking the list what they think the
possibility of a piston coming apart and breaking a
valve is as opposed to the other way around.  i am in
no way asking for people to &quot;beat up&quot; AVP.  i feel my
post was open ended merely to let the listees give an
opinion of there own and i feel the list should know
how a company that supplies us with parts does in a
case where they possibly could be at fault.  if you
remember when i initially posted this a few weeks ago
i also posted pictures of the head and piston for
listmembers to see.  i know this isnt the same as
having it in your hand, but i am trying to get
somewhat of an educated opinion from some of the
smartest bus people i have found.  i apologize if my
post wasnt up to par.  i am certainly trying to be
fair with this.  i feel i am doing pretty well seeing
my engine is dead a mere 3000 miles after having it
redone and i simply am trying to figure out what
course of action to take since my hard earned money is
now gone on an engine that doesnt go.

&gt; Here's what I think... I think you should work this
&gt; out privately with
&gt; AVP.
&gt; 
&gt; What the heck is anybody on the list supposed to
&gt; respond to since we
&gt; don't have the parts in hand to inspect ourselves?
&gt; 
&gt; By all accounts AVP is a responsible and responsive
&gt; vendor; they've
&gt; offered to help you out with a problem that, if
&gt; they're correct in
&gt; their assessment of the problem, is not their
&gt; responsibility.  So what
&gt; are we supposed to do, chime in with a chorus of
&gt; &quot;I've been driving
&gt; VW's for 30 years and NEVER had a piston go
&gt; bad...AVP is a bunch of
&gt; scumbags!!!!&quot;????  The open-ended nature of your
&gt; posting suggests to
&gt; me that that's the kind of response you're hoping to
&gt; get, supposedly
&gt; putting pressure on AVP to buy you a new engine.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to ask a specific question, e.g., &quot;has
&gt; anybody had a
&gt; piston separate on them?&quot;, go ahead and ask.
