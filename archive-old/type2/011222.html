I recently put a LeCarra RV steering wheel on Sparky, my 71 bus. It's a 16&quot;
diameter wheel and it fits perfectly. The wheel and the hub adapter are
separate items but the installation only took about five minutes. The
opening is just the right size to see all the instruments through and the
feel is much less squirrelly than the stock wheel. Still very easy to steer
and it looks great. I got the satin finish spokes with a black leather
wrap. Bus Boys carry them as well as some other places I found while
searching the web for pictures prior to buying. The only thing that needed
to be done differently was that I needed different sized screws to attach
the turn signal cancelling ring. I think they were 3mm but I can't remember
for sure. The good news was that the holes were already there and in the
right place. Hope this helps.
