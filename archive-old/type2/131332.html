Subject: RE: [T2] Looking for a High-top.

You have NO idea how tempting that is. And I'm in SoCal. But you do realize 
that the slightest crosswind sends your poor bus into the next lane with a 
hitop, right?

A pop top does have a one person cot, right?

Hey...

    I've got a 1970 Westy that I'd like to drive across the country in May, 
and I'm looking for a high-top roof I can put on it.  Is there anyone in 
So-Cal with a spare roof they'd like to part with?  I've got a pop-top if 
you'd like to trade.  I need to make a bunk in the top of the van that will 
sleep two people so I don't have to worry about a place to sleep when my van 
is filled with stuff.

Thanks
