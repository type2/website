Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel Engine for later type 2?

A rather brilliant and accomplished mechanic that I lean heavily on here
in Toronto once retrofitted a Rabbit diesel engine into a late Baywindow.
Took him a few months of figuring out mounting points, how to route the
watercooled lines, etc., but he loves diesels and really wanted a Bay with
a diesel in it as a personal project (this was when he was still living in
Europe). 

He got it up and running and working great, and found that it was so
dog-slow as to be almost unuseable, I think partially a problem with the
gear ratios. I don't know too many details. Anyway, he sold it to a friend
who drove it about 200,000 kms happily all around Europe. 

That very well may be the only diesel Bay in existence.
