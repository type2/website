In the Euro campers, where do they carry the Camping Gaz bottles?  Are they
upright, or lay down models?


&gt;The USA delivered Westys had the tank outside, some Federal safety rule I
&gt;guess......
&gt;
&gt;but they are considered &quot;freaks&quot; in Europe, no one had ever seen them before,
&gt;and it was a real pain trying to get it filled, the Propane place in Bad
&gt;Camberg would not do it....
&gt;
&gt;I ended up filling it in Holland  where they had the right adapter...
&gt;
&gt;most of the Euro campers use refillable/exchange Camping Gaz bottles
