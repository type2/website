That's a great deal on that bus.  If it's rust free the body would be worth more than that.  Congrats...KR

Look at how straight and virtually rust free this bus is! And in what good

it appears to be a very good starting point for a bus.

&gt; are hooked up backwards. Can anyone else confirm this?
