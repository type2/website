Subject: [T2] 78 westy to part out

I am thinking about acquiring a 78 westy that has the green plaid interior
the body on it sucks, but the interior is complete in good shape.

The engine is shot.


I would buy it to part it, for I hate to see it go to the crusher.  I have
parted several vanagons, but have no idea what the interior bits, etc.  are
worth.

Any thoughts, or experiences on the matter?
