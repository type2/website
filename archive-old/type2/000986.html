I recently replaced my filler hose on my '73. I think it has the same hose
as the '72. Anyway, I used the Gates 57mm hose with a 2 1/4 muffler pipe
elbow bent to about 80 degrees (got it from a local Meineke shop - $5). I
found 90 degrees a bit too sharp. Make sure you leave enough steel past each
end of the bend to allow the clamps room to grip and the hose to seal. It
has worked great and I have had no leakage (liquid or fumes).

&gt;&gt; I seem to have run into a stumbling block on readying my '72 westy for
this years camping. The 2 1/4&quot; fuel filler neck is no longer obtainable from
VW. I searched the archives and found mention of it several times yet
havn't seen a replacment or alternative solution. Since its hard to inspect
the 90' bend area next to the tank i'm leary of using standard straight
Gates hose with a 90' elbow of some type although thats about the only
solution other than going strait and cuttin a hole on the body for a new
gas cap fitting. Has anyone retrofitted or otherwise found a solution for
this problem?
