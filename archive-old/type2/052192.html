Subject: [T2] 3 passenger front seat for Vanagon

List:
Many years ago I owned a 70 type 2 with an interesting option. It was
originally a 7 seater, with 2 buckets in front and a walkthru in
between. Well this one had  conversion brackets that allowed a 2 person
seat to be fitted in the center and right positions, thus making it an 8
seater. It was apparently  factory pieces, having the black padded stuff
to match the partition padding on each side.  I transferred it to
another car.
What I'd really like to find is such a conversion for a Vanagon. It's
probably a long shot, more likely possibly from Canada or Europe where
the commercials are sold.
This will allow me to seat 3 people in my 82 work Vanagon. The back is
gutted and fitted with shelves. The Vanagon is quite a bit wider and
should seat 3 across with quite a bit of room. My 69 double cab is quite
snug with 3 across if they are all full width adults!
