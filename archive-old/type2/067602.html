TO unsubscribe from the list here is what you do:


Send a message to:

majordomo_at_primenet_dot_com

you do not need anything in the subject line.

In the body of the message you should have absolutley nothing except for 
the following line (this includes deleting you signature that normally 
follows a message):

unsubscribe type2 &lt;your email address here&gt;



That should be all there is to it
Bon Chance!
