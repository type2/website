&gt; I'm hoping to get this engine done soon :)  I have some time off,
and spent
&gt; this weekend advancing my welding technology and other projects.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway -- I am trying to put together a thermostat system from parts
I've
&gt; collected... but it has been over a year since I took these apart and
&gt; painted them, so knowing how they go back together is another deal.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this how the thermostat rod hooks up to the flaps:
&gt; http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/stand/ThermoRod01.jpg &lt;-- Thermostat rod
flaps open
&gt; http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/stand/ThermoRod02.jpg &lt;-- Thermostat rod flaps
&gt; closed

Yes, the rod slides into the sleeve from the rear (RIR).

&gt; A diagram I have shows putting a washer or something on the end, but
I can't
&gt; figure out how you are supposed to do that?

It's not a washer, but a speed-nut.  This is a thin piece of metal
that has a hole slightly smaller than the rod with cuts radiating out
from the hole part way to the edge of the washer.  the cuts allow the
speed-nut to be forced over the rod in one direction but make it very
hard to remove in the other direction.  You can probably find suitable
speed-nuts at any well-equipped hardware store.  Take your rod with
you to figure out the correct size.  Don't push them on, though, as
you can't get them off again intact! 

  Is there something that you are
&gt; supposed to snap to the end of the rod to keep it from coming out of
the
&gt; hoop?
&gt; 
&gt; And one last photo, I put my rod on book, I don't have a proper
ruler I can
&gt; find :)  It is only slightly wider than my 1963-1967 Bentley book.  
&gt; 
&gt;  http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/stand/ThermoRod03.jpg &lt;-- Rod shape
referenced on
&gt; book.
&gt; 
&gt; When I install all this, no matter how I adjust the bracket, the
thermostat
&gt; is being pushed too far up.  In other words, when engine is stone
cold the
&gt; flaps are still open about 80% of the way.

My rod is 8 1/2 inches long from the centerline of the bent end to the
threaded end.  The rod has a couple of bends in it, which means that
it is shorter than it would be if it were completely straight.  Yours
looks straighter than mine.

The normal problem is the opposite of yours.  If the fan shroud is
installed incorrectly it won't seat all the way down, resulting in
closed flaps or the inability to screw the thermostat onto the rod.

Perhaps your rod is missing a couple of kinks?
