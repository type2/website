Hey, that sounds about like me right now. =)  I'm scraping up the money
for a set of rings, borrowed a hone and ran it through the jugs ..

&gt;Be very patient, you should beable to eventually get the rings out and the
&gt;&lt;deletia&gt;
&gt;have tiny little rings cut in them when they are turned on a lathe. Look for
&gt;these rings. and see how far they go down.

The pistons have those tiny rings all the way up to just above the top ring
all the way around.  I've been checking things out as well as possible 
without splitting the case, and this engine looks pretty low-mileage -- no
gunk or varnish deposits, good clearances towards the &quot;tighter&quot; end of
specs .. just those dratted rings.

I'll go get some cheap diesel and soak the piston for a while .. mebbe I'll 
get lucky. =)
