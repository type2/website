Subject: Re: [T2] '71 seat belts

The ones with the white lever are the original '71 belts.  The orange
buttons came later on.

Unless you are trying for a &quot;10+&quot; restoration, don't bother with the
original belts.  They are rather hard to use and I'd be rather worried
about being trapped in them in the event of an accident.  Imagine some
random citizen trying how to unlatch the belt while the fire is growing!

Inertia reel belts from late model bugs are a nice replacement for the
front seats of early Bays.  You have to modify the brackets slightly to
allow the reel to be rotated 90 degrees.  The same belts and reels are
also found in Audis and watercooled VWs.

&gt; Hey everybody,
&gt;
&gt; The seatbelts that came with my '71 are in poor shape.  I found another set
&gt; in a '71 that was being parted out.  When those seatbelts arrived, I noticed
&gt; that they have different release buttons from the ones already in my bus.
&gt; The ones in the bus now have the rectangular button in the middle of the
&gt; unit just like my '73...I think the button says &quot;Press&quot;.  The new ones have
&gt; a white lever attached to the side.
&gt;
&gt; I'm just curious if anyone knows the story on the two different styles of
&gt; seat belts from the same year.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Brian
