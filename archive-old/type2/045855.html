&gt; If you want reliable starting in Winter weather, and some reserve to handle

&gt; You can even install a Group 27 battery if you want.

&gt; Installing a non-standard battery sometimes requires a little ingenuity to
&gt; hold it in place, as often the stock
&gt; hold-down clamp won't work.  A very common arrangement is to install a Grp.
&gt; 24 in a plastic marine/RV battery box for corrosion protection, then
&gt; stabilize it with blocks of wood cut to fit snugly around the base of the
&gt; box.  You can also use the hold-down brackets and strap that often comes
&gt; with the battery boxes, but that requires drilling some holes to bolt down
&gt; the brackets.

Another approach is to make a base plate that is held down by the stock
hold-down bolt.  Attach new hold-downs to this base plate to secure your
battery.  The plastic battery box is a very good idea!
