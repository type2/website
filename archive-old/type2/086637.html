Don't know if you could get the sunroof or not in a Champagne Edition (also

known at my house as a Cow Poop Edition 'cause there is SO much brown!
&lt;grin&gt;).

As for the air - just look around for the under dash unit. None of the
North American busses came with factory air - it was all dealer installed
using VWoA approved aftermarket suppliers.

If you use one of these units you need to update it anyhow so only the
visible portion is really important.

The compressor needs to be converted to a Sankyo rotary which uses ALOT
less HP than the old piston compressor.

That will require a whole other bracket.

Also the dryer will require replacement.

The Evaporators (the outside portion of the coils - don't be surprised if
it is called a condenser - I ALWAYS get them backwards, can't make it stick

in my head) can be reused if they are in good condition.

ALL of the hoses will have to be replaced.

You need to talk to an a/c specialist to see if they recommend R-12 (no
longer produced and very $$$) or a replacement gas such as Freeze-12
(supposed to be able to replace or mix with R-12) or R-134a - the current
gas in the newer cars.

Do not use one of the flammable replacement gasses. It shouldn't ever cause

a problem - but if it did or if you were in a collision - - - what would
happen? We at least know there would be a CHANCE of fire even if I was
unlikely. With a regular Freon you know there could never be a fire caused
by the refrigerant in your system. I have not seen any crash tests - I'm
just theorizing here.

It isn't a difficult system to install IF you study and IF you are lucky
enough to remove the system yourself - noting the locations of the system
components. In theory you could install the system yourself and take it to
be gassed by a local tech.

One more comment on the Champagne Edition. It was a trim package - nothing
more. It was colors and chrome bumpers. Chrome replacement bumpers are easy

to get, just add the rubber impact strip, and then use brown vinyl dye to
make your black dash and steering wheel brown. I recently took my brown
Champagne Edition and changed it's colors to greys and blacks (modern,
plain, neutral colors) because I tired of the brown which was fading to
black anyhow. In my observations - the Champagne Edition simply substitutes

brown vinyl and plastic parts for black ones found in standard busses.

Don't buy the dyes in the typical FLAPS. There are better dyes to be had at

the auto body suppliers which cover better and are more durable. $5-$7.50 a

can in a variety of colors. Scrub all the vinyl with mineral spirits. It
won't damage the vinyl. Don't immerse or soak the vinyl. This removes the
silicone Armour-All (or whatever brands you used) and any body grease from
your sweaty hands. Once all is perfectly clean - your white rag is still
clean after a hard scrub, then allow the mineral spirits to evaporate. Then

go over the parts with a clean rag (new rag) with lacquer thinner on it.
This can affect the vinyl so just make light wiping motions. This is only
to clean off the mineral spirits which is quite oily and often will react
with dyes and paints. If you need to clean the parts again - restart the
process. Let completely dry.

VW vans only came with black and brown dashes for many years. Break out of
the box and change it's color. Try something different. In 10 years when
you tire of it or want to restore the van to OEM factory perfect you can
just re-dye the parts all over again. No harm done.

Lastly I recommend removing the dash from the vehicle b/c it makes the
process so much more complete and  professional looking. This dye works on
plastic and vinyl interchangably.

The dash will also separate into vinyl and steel portions which you need to

do b/c the dye does not work on steel and paint does not work on vinyl.

Good luck.
