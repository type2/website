Outside the western hemisphere, T3 is another term for the Vanagon.
Since he's in Australia I'm sure that's what he meant .. even if he hadn't
 said '82, hightop and camper. =)  I'm not sure what abbreviation is used to
 designate Fast/Square/Notchbacks in place of T3, though.

Correct. From the Bus Acronym section in the www.type2_dot_com library:

TYPE IV - 1700cc-2000cc engine found in all 1972-1979 T2 buses, the VW Type 4 411/412, the Porsche 914, and
1980-1983-1/2 T3 Vanagons in the US. Also optionally available in buses/Vanagons outside the US.

TYPE 2 - Any Volkswagen Transporter. Since the Beetle was the first car produced by VW, it became known within
the company as the Type 1. The bus or transporter was the second type vehicle produced, so it became known as
the Type 2. The Squareback/Fastback was the Type 3, and the 411/412 was the Type 4 (which had the same &quot;type
IV&quot; engine as the 1972-1983-1/2 Type 2's (buses).


  a.. T1 - The first &quot;generation&quot; of Transporters, from 1949-1967 (note that this is NOT Type 1, but just T1
(for Transporter 1). Strictly speaking, it should be Type 2, T1. Known as the Station Wagon or Microbus.

  b.. T2 - The 2nd &quot;generation&quot; of Transporters, from 1968-1979, known as the Station Wagon or Bus.

  c.. T3 - The 3rd &quot;generation&quot; of Transporters, from 1980-1991, known in North America as &quot;Vanagon&quot;, and
elsewhere as &quot;Caravelle&quot; or just &quot;Transporter&quot;.

  d.. T4 - The 4th &quot;generation&quot; of Transporters, from 1992-????, known in North America as &quot;Eurovan&quot;, and
elsewhere as &quot;Caravelle&quot; or just &quot;Transporter&quot;.

The difference is Type 2 or T2. Type is the body style, T is the model.
A beetle would be a Type 1 with a type 1 engine in it.
A split bus would be a Type 2 [T1] with a type 1 engine in it.
