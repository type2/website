&gt;Hi Dan,
&gt;
&gt;Glad you are enjoying the bus and it's working out and you got the pop top
&gt;sorted.    For westy panels and headliner the choices are AFAICT, find some
&gt;decent ones in a junkyard, or buy some 1/8&quot; birch veneer and make new.  for
&gt;the roof you need 5x5 pieces of plywood, which can be hard to find.  
&gt;
&gt;enjoy
&gt;
Ok- a quick followup:

1. What does AFAICT stand for?

As Far As I Can Tell

2. If we go for the veneer, I assume I would find some very thin plywood, 
apply the veneer, then cut (and in the case of the roof, bend) to fit. Is 
that right?
- - -  --
well, the shops sells stuff they call 'birch venneer' whch is ply wood with
the one side being the veneer.   I use the 1/8 stuff for a westy.  So you just
need to cut it in to shape (I use a skilsaw for the straight bits and a jigsaw
for the curved bits), varnish it, and install the panels.  Measure measure
before you cut make sure the grain goes the right way etc.
......
3. Also, I have most or all of the original interior Westie pieces 
(except the roof and door panels), but they are in bad shape. What do you 
think about peeling off the old veneer and applying the new? And, if that 
would work, what should I use as trim for the edges?
 - - - -- 
um-  use them as patterns if you make new ones.
