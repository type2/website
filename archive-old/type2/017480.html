Subject: Re: whats a good price for a 78 camper?
Message-ID: &lt;36FAA4E7.FB05F5C6_at_redshift_dot_com&gt;

&quot;I have a 78 camper model that is an automatic, and I was wondering what
would
be a fair price to sell it?  It needs work to it for the camper stuff
and
exterior, but it runs good except for the problem of breaking down
whenever we
go up hills.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated..&quot;

...Hmmm, you don't say much about WHY it breaks down, or HOW it breaks
down but obviously it needs work everywhere. Runs well includes uphill
as well. Lotsa stuff about selling your bus in archives. I hate to say
it but I think it'll probably be pretty hard to sell. Depending on where
you are, give ME $500 and I'll take it off your hands....
