Subject: Re: The type2 mailing list members site... (map)

&gt;This site present to you the north america map, where all the members of 
&gt;the type2 mailing list are registered.

What are the moral and ethical ramifications of &quot;outing&quot; a couple
listmembers?  We have 2 lurkers from the Sacramento area, with 2 barndoors,
a '62 double door, '67 camper, '64 21-window, '59 mango standard, etc.
amongst them, and another lurker who just didn't pipe up and say anything,
who has a '63 single cab and a SuperLagWagon camper.  And thats all within
bicycle distance from my house...
