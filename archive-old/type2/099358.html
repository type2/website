Subject: Re: [T2] Dome Light

The only thing wrong with fastening the new wire to one end of the old wire 
and pulling through is that when the old wire fried (it looks like one end of 
the wire was attached to the positive terminal of the battery and the other 
to the negative until it got so hot all the insulation and some of the wire 
melted) the two ends are no longer connected.  I had thought of this one 
until I pulled on the light end and it just dropped out.

Thanks anyway,
