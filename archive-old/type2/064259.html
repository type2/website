Subject: When/what to overhaul

Friends, I have a couple of questions about overhauling an engine.

The engine in question is a 1776 with 55,000 miles.  It belongs to a 
friend.  He parked the car one day and the next the engine would not 
turn over.  It turned back and forth but was stuck in one spot.  We 
figured there was a valve sitting in one of the cylinders.  We torn it
down and found a huge amount of carbon in the number one cylinder had 
blocked the thing from turning.  With the heads removed and the 
cylinders wired in place the engine turns fine by hand.

What I want to know is where we should go from here.  We could clean 
up the carbon a bit and bolt it back together but would like to do some 
maintenance whilst it is possible.  We are going to have the heads 
rebuilt and were wondering about what else to do at the moment.

Should the p&amp;c's be replaced at this time?  Is is possible to just 
clean them up and replace the rings?  What about rod bearings?

We are assuming the bottom end is still good.  The endplay is .008 and
will be brought back to .003.  So, where to go from here?  Thanks, Jim
