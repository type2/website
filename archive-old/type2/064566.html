Subject: splitty westy tent instructions

I just found a nifty thing in a bag of junk.   It is a photocopy of
'Instructions to build up the WESTFALIA Tent/Awning, fixed on the VW-Kombi or
VW-Microbus'.    It is in German and English, specifies MEN setting it up,
has a helpful picture, and uses words like &quot;Haltewinkel&quot;  without laughing.

Now I just need the tent to go on the 65, and two men to  'build it up'.
