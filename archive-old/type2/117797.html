Subject: Re: [T2] chiantirot L 31 H touch up paint

www.paintscratch_dot_com  sells small bottles with a brush, just like the 
dealer used to sell of whatever color you want.

Be sure and mark that you want &quot;single stage&quot;.  $14.95 or so I think.
They will warn you that if your paint is badly faded...it may not match 
exactly!

Order by color code.  Be careful with the web form though, it is not 
totally intuitive.

Nice people, I recommend them.

Cheers, dave
