&gt; floor (the corrugated section), but not the door edge.  This was covered
&gt; by a piece of 1/8&quot; masonite.  Over the masonite was a sheet of plastic and
&gt; vinyl flooring.  The masonite and vinyl had some ~3/4&quot; oval head sheet
&gt; metal screws at the door, but was otherwise held in place by the

&gt; different years may have had different construction techniques. 

I replaced the floor in my camper (born on date is May '73) about
12 years ago.  The icebox drain hose found a way to pour water
betw the steel and wooden flooring.

The original floor consisted of a few hardwood blocks,about 2x3x1/2&quot;
in the low spots of the steel floor.  Then a sheet of 1/4&quot; masonite
followed by 1/2&quot; plywood.  Grey linoleum with a pebble finish on
top of all that.  The wooden 'furniture' holds the floor down.
