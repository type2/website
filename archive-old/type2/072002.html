Hi, all,

Having just toured western Canada, my family and I are considering hitting
the Eastern parts next summer.  However, the thought of having to first
drive all across the West is daunting.

Soooo.... I wonder if anyone knows of bulletin boards, etc. devoted to
temporary exchanges of busses/ westies, etc?  Similar to house-swapping, I
suppose.  I'd like to find someone in Eastern Canada who wants to come west
-- then we could swap Westies and tour the other part of this vast land of
ours....

Does that mean my Westy becomes an Easty?  §:-O

Roger
