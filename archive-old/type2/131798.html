Ok the quick and easy. I did not yeild perfect results from the stand, as i 
wanted but as for now it works perfectly fine for the work at hand.

Like I said, I started out with the intention of bolting this stand to the 
case. It would not fit so I had to cut the supports that attach the case to 
the plate. I cut them too short. So I ripped off the bellhousing on a 
standby tranny. Bingo it fit .... sort of. But it is solid, very sturdy and 
it rolls around with ease. It even rotates some. The bolts hit the stand 
because of my improvised mountig antics, but that will all be corrected 
later. Enjoy the pics and poke as much fun at me as you like, I am happy for 
now. No flame suit, I like the heat.

Later,
