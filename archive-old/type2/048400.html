Subject: [T2] Newbie question - what have I got?

Hey all!
     I was just given (!) a 71 camper bus with lots of spares, including 3
engines, complete with tin, boxes of carbs, pistons, cranks etc. Even a
spare windshield. The bus was apparently a Cal vehicle for most of it's life
so far and is in excellent shape except for driver's floor, battery tray,
etc - the &quot;usual areas&quot;, I suspect.I'm a moderately good mechanic, having
experience on most of my vehicles, including a Corvair (pardon my language),
old Brit bikes and my current other car, a 77 AMC Matador for which I need a
bombproof suit to work on the front springs. Don't ask. Anyway, I've been
reading the list for 2 weeks or so and I have a couple of real basic
questions. First, What have I got? Is it a camper, Westfalia, or what? It
has a fold down rear bench, cooler, closet, sink and provision for outside
electrical connection. No pop top, though.Second - while it appears from
looking at the engine and manuals that a 1600 (that IS what I (should) have,
right?) is a pretty easy rebuild as such things go, am I wrong in thinking
that they don't last all that long? What are some of the other critical
areas to pay attention to? Obviously I have to thoroughly clean all oil
passages and change the bearings and rings, but what else? I do NOT plan on
performance modifications, but anything that will ensure reliability and
longevity are of definite interest.
TIA! Tom
