After taking off the straight bumpers from the parts bus, I realized they were
straight but unusable due to the rust around the bolt areas (toast). I looked
again at mine and even though they were pitted, there was still good metal
there. These were bent, twisted, and full of small &quot;dings&quot;. 

First to the sandblaster to remove the old paint and rust. Then took them
right to Tri Cities Plating (east Tennessee)  for the straightening. I asked
if there was any hope. They said come back for them in one week. Called and
not ready. Went back after 3 weeks and had to go in the back door as road was
closed in front.

The place is amazing. Floor to roof in bumpers in all stages of restoration.
Thousands of them. Chrome everywhere. Large grills that must be from forties
era cars and trucks. Look like new.

They get stuff in from all over the country. I asked if my '71 bus parts were
done and we looked around. Nope, not done yet,  just two parts, and he showed
me two huge chrome pieces. Those were not mine. Looked again and he said yes
this is it. Nope, a huge chrome 200 pound piece. Finally figured out that it
was a VW bus, not a BUS (trailways type).

Mine were ready and wrapped in 3 inches of protected wrap. They had
transformed the pitted warped metal into factory NEW looking bumpers. Never
seen anything like it. Perfect. Took them straight for primer as the virgin
metal will rust before your eyes. 

They have to have metal to work with, but the results are incredable. Have to
give them an A+ rating if anyone needs this service. From the looks of things,
they ship everywhere. Looked at me funny for not wanting chrome.

Now I have to find the rubber that goes between the parts in the front. Any
help? Went for paint today.
