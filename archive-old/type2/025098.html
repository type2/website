Shaggy,

I didn't have to modify the 84 vanagon seats at all, they fit into the seat 
rails in my 79 westphalia.  

I stripped the seat covers off of the vanagon seats and found that the 
padding, foam and springs were in good shape.  I took the 79's plaid seat 
covers to an auto upholstery shop and had a 2 inch wide strip of matching 
vinyl added to the bottom of the backrest cover.  I then installed them on 
the vanagon seats.

I did have to remove the original armrest/door pulls on the bus door panels.  
They interfered with the flip down arm rests on the seats.  I am going to 
install vanagon door pulls (somehow) to replace them.
