Subject: Request of Australian Listees, Crewcab body?
Date: Thu, 10 May 2001 23:34:37 +1000
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Firstly, sorry if this post breaches the rules in any way, I checked the
charter and it didn't APPEAR to do so, if I have, sorry.

To the question, this may well be ( and probably is ) a stupid question, but
I'm trying to find a early to mid 70s type 268 crew cab with a decent body
at an affordable price. Running would be nice, registered even better, but
I'm really after one with solid bodywork to do up.

Any information and/or assistance that people may be able to render would be
greatly appreciated.

I'm in Sydney, but anything on the East Coast would be of interest, and
perhaps further afield as well.

( As background, I'm currently running a Corolla wagon, as well as Tigger,
my '74 Campmobile, as the camper's too heavy to be usable as everyday
transport for work. I'd really like to get rid of the Corolla, and recently
I've come to the decision that a Bay Crewcab would be the perfect
alternative, IF I can find one that's affordable. )

Thanking you in anticipation.

Once again, sorry if I've inadvertently bent the rules.

Regards,

Neale
