Subject: Re: [T2] foam under gas tank?

&gt;I removed the gas tank, (78 westy) and found the leak = old hoses for the vent

&gt;Anyone shed some light on this?  There wasn't any there when I removed it.  I
&gt;have some 1/8&quot; thick rubber material.  should I put that under it where the
&gt;tan makes contact?

I'm not sure what year they stopped this practice at the factory. There was also a foam ring around the opening in the floor for the fuel lines up to 67 but it seems to have persisted for a few years afterward based only on what I've found at the junkyard.

As for the mat under the tank it wasn't there on later models and I don't think it's a good idea to put anything there that can trap water. When I took out my tank I was surprised at the rust under the tank figuring the compartment was more or less sealed. Other people may disagree but I would rust proof the bottom and not put in a mat of any kind..
