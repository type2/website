Subject: What kind of Jacks/Stands to Buy


Greetings,

I want to buy some jack and stands for my bus.  I currently own no jacks or
stands.

What I need is Jacks that will allow me to do all repair and maintenance on
my bus, including any engine or brake work.  Obviously, safety is a factor,
so I want jacks &amp; jack stands that will let me work under the bus without
fear of the house falling down.

Can someone please advise what I require in terms of jacks / stands.  Also
appreciated would be a description of minimum and maximum requirements.
For example, perhaps a suggested starter kit to get me off and going, then
the 'good-to-have' additions that can follow later, if req'd.

Thank you for the continued support.

Regards.
Shawn Luft
