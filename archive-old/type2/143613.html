Subject: Re: [T2] Where is the motor (sic) supposed to be?

The British team attempting to set/break the electric car speed
record in Nevada last May, finally gave in and went home because
the car just would not start...

List members with both VW's and LBC's could've told 'em that 
Lucas electrics don't do well in a cold and damp environment... ;-(
