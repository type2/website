&gt; This question is floating on another list...Does anyone know what defines a
&gt; rebuilt engine? Or is there a &quot;legal&quot; definition in your state that you know
&gt; of?

Are you crazy, man? &quot;Rebuilt&quot; engine could be anything from washing it off
in mineral spirits and changing a few seals to everything new except the
case, which has been on a Rottler or Haas mill.

If you can get 58 million or so of your closest friends to write me in for
President, here is what I will do for you. I will make an Engine Buyer's
Consumer Protection Act.

1. I'll outlaw the terms &quot;rebuilt&quot; and &quot;overhauled&quot; to describe the product
that goes in your car. They could mean anything or nothing, and usually more
of the latter than the former.

2. I'll define a Used engine as one that is removed from one car and placed
in another with no disassembly in between. Further, only the vehicle owner
is allowed to buy this, it has to come from a salvage yard, and either the
salvage yard or the car owner has to install it.

3. Further, a Refurbished engine gets new rings, bearings, gaskets...and all
worn-out parts must be replaced. Then it must be labeled a Refurbished
engine. Kind of a caveat emptor.

4. We'll then have a Remanufactured engine, which needs new pistons, needs
new cylinder liners or replaceable cylinders if the engine came that way,
all necessary machining and new valves, and new rubber parts like the timing
belt. 

5. A Renewed engine? Machined main casting, new everything else.

6. A New engine is taken off the assembly line at the manufacturer's engine
plant, shoved in a bag, crated and sent to you.

7. A Custom engine is one that needs substantially non-standard replacement
parts. I'm not talking about main bearings that are .020 oversize here, I'm
thinking 90.5mm pistons when the engine came with 85.5.
