Mark, I'm afraid I don't have any solutions for you either. My '72 suffers
from a similar e-brake disfunction, but I managed to pass inspection
through creative clutch use and I just haven't gone back to check out the
problem. (I live in Memphis, where parking almost always involves flat
terrain.)

Lately, though, I've noticed that the e-brake sometimes engages. This
appears to be related to speed right before I stop. I think it has
something to do with my brake booster function. That is, I know there's a
hole in my booster diaphram, but I think I'm getting some boost at speed.
Another listee sent me a booster (gratis!)--thanks David
(wolves_at_full-moon)--so I may have a chance to test that theory. The odd
thing, though, is that the e-brake should function independent of the
hydraulic and booster systems. Hmmm, maybe it's not so odd, maybe it's just
that my *theory* that's flawed!

Anyway, if you discover a real solution, I'd be interested in learning
about it.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;All:
&gt;I can't get the E-brakes to work on my '72 Westy....
