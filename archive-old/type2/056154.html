I found a stockpile of about 6 80's era Vanagon &quot;Westy&quot; Models....

Since I'm  only interested in 70's loafs, I had little interest.  Any one on
the list interested? I'd be glad to pick up a few and make some mailing
arraingements.

They are 9.99 apiece if I remember correctly.... shipping can't be much....

Let me know.
