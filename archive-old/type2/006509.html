Subject: Exhaust fumes in Cab
Date: Tue, 12 Jun 2001 00:18:59 +0100

I am a new comer to this e-mail but saying that it's great to know you
guys/gals are there to help with good advice, but hi anyhow.

I seem to be getting exhaust fumes in the cab of my '78.

I've checked my exhaust and heater connections but all seems fine.

I wonder if anyone else has had a simular problem and how they resolved
it???

Yours hoping

Cheers
Pete
