Subject: Re: *WHICH* Hoover Bit????;-)

 &quot;Jaime Chriswisser&quot; &lt;sonofbob3_at_yahoo_dot_com wonders&gt;
&gt; I've been around this list for a little over 2 years
&gt; and I *thought* I knew what a Hoover Bit was....but
&gt; from some of the recent posts, I'm no longer so sure!
&gt;
&gt; Now...before anyone gets all huffy-puffy and says to
&gt; check the archives; I have. There are references to
&gt; *two* completely different items that are *both*
&gt; labeled as 'Hoover Bits' 8-/
&gt;
&gt; The first item mentioned, was a piece that attaches
&gt; the shroud to the dog house.... I couldn't quite grasp
&gt; exactly what was meant by this. Knowing that Bob was
&gt; (is still, I imagine;-) a freak about sealing against
&gt; any air-leaks, I imagine it was something along these
&gt; lines (?).
&gt;
&gt; The second item mentioned (and this is what *I*
&gt; thought of as a 'Hoover Bit'), is the threaded
&gt; lamp-rod that you use to prevent the metal fuel line
&gt; from being worn-through by the cooling shroud.
&gt;
&gt; So....which is it
Jaime,
As I understand, the small 1X2 inch piece of tin that screws to the front
FIF of the doghouse shroud is the renowned &quot;Hoover Bit&quot;.  The lamp rod for
the fuel line is the &quot;Hoover bulkhead fitting&quot;.  Correct??
