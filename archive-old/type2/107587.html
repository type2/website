Subject: Re: [T2] Rear bearing maintenance??

I came up with a partial answer by calling John's Bug Shop in Niagara Falls
Ontario. He's never done this but I got enough info to evolve a plan...
1) Remove half shafts for CV Joint maintenance.
2) Install grease nipple on backing plate bearing housing
3) Partially pound stub axles out, just an inch or so
4) Grease nipple until grease pushes inner grease seals out
5) Flush enough grease through till bearings have all new grease
6) Rotate as you flush, to get the grease through all parts of the bearing
7) Remove stub axle, replace same or new seals.


This is a lot of trouble, but would be an easy addition to CV joint
repacking. I think I'll try it this summer. Any comments welcome.

Subject: Re: [T2] Rear bearing maintenance??


Richard- I'm interested in greasing my rear wheel bearings too. Problem I
see with drilling and tapping in a grease nipple is, you're introducing
filings into the hub, which will find their way into the bearings. What
about my idea of removing the bearing retainer on the backing plate, and
installing a grease nipple on it? At least this part can be easily removed
and cleaned up after.
