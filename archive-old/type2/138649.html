Subject: Re: [T2] VAG 1367 Tester for Sale NOS

&gt;From: Don Tuleja

&gt;Wow. That thing looks almost new!


It does say NOS(Non Offending Sh!t). But if you figure what a good timing 
light cost these days $75 bucks is not bad. An you will finally get to use 
the flywheel pickup. Although it does say it is for diesel cars I am not 
sure of the diference a quick google showed the attachments at samstag.
