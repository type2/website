Subject: Re: [T2] Lowering kit for busses - air bags

First of all - it is your bus so do with it as you please....

However - I was watching a Speedvision car show where a fellow was demo-ing his air bag system on a domestic uni-body. As he lowered it and then raised it I noticed that one corner of the hood raised relative to the fender and grill section... Was it loose? 

Got to asking several professional custom car guys I know about this and they ALL warned that the air bag system is hard on the chassis - causing excessive flexing and twisting. Can lead to chassis weakening (as can the cutting of mods of the chassis to fit the suspension mods). In other words not a good long term mod... 

The type of thing that is difficult to undo... 

Chris
