&gt; Thanks to all who repiled to my question.  I have decided to do the
&gt; following: Bag the full flow idea, use a spin on filter oil pump,

The spin on oil pump won't work on a 71. The rear cross member will
interfere.  Also, the manifold heat section of the stock muffler will
interfere with the filter, even on vehicles without the rear carrier.

Sorry to be the bearer.
