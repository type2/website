Subject: [T2] power hookups

If any of you have hooked up any electrical devices (i.e. radio) in the
front of your bus, where do you hook up your connections.  I noticed
that on my 76 westy fuse 7 is unused and therefore a spade connector can
be connected to the back for a protected connection.  Anyone else have
any other preferred locations or wire to which a low drain device can
pull electricity from.

Thanks,
Mike
