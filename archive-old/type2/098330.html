&gt; Anyway I took the throttle body apart. The seal is the only thing

Jeff,

You probably did more than that.  You probably also brought your oil temps
down a couple (10 or so) degrees.  I thought you had replaced this seal
earlier during this odyssey?  Was it you who thought you might be having a
leak thru the butterfly shaft on the throttle body?
