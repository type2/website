Subject: Bus spotting in song(Friday topic)

Hello listees,
    As I was driving along today in a rural area, I picked up on an AM
station that was playing the song &quot;Convoy&quot; I never noticed until today that
the song refers to a Chartruese Microbus as part of the convoy. I just
chuckled at the mental image of a microbus in a convoy w/ a bunch of 18
wheelers cruising at 70mph.
Best Wishes,
Jim
Hampstead, NC
No bus for now, just gave mine up for adoption
