ok...today I went to a Parts America store and almost crapped my
pants....they have almost everything I could come up with for my 71
bus...except a muffler...and they could order that...unlike most
places...they were very knowledgeable too!  anyways...I purchased new
Bosch Platinum spark plugs, a new condenser, and a new points set and am
going to get my starter tested tonight to see if its still good.  This
is mainly an update for the few who are following but I hope you all can
give me feedback.  I can't get the motor to turn over and actually
run....it turns the pistons and everything....it just won't run on its
own...  I don't know what the exact terminology is....  I picked up a
Muir manual today (How to Keed Your Volkswagen Alive .. A step by step
manual for the compleat idiot..hehe)  It is really good....the PO of my
bus lost al of the manuals so I had to go buy a new one.
Anyways....I really need to get my bus started and hope this works...I'm
going to clean up all of the connections and everything too...
Is there anything else that could be wrong??I'm thinking spark plug
wires....my distributor is really really clean inside too...maybe the
points are just worn out...who knows...
any suggestions??
