Subject: fuel line replacement

I am scheduled to replace the fuel lines on my 1969 Westy.  I have 
taken care of the lines from the carb to the pump and the pump to the 
metal line.  Yes I have taken care of the grommet in the front tin.

I am prone to using an inline fuel filter between two pieces of line on 
the underside of the bus.  Of course I use hose clamps on every 
connections and after reading the Type 2 library,  am heavily 
considering some safety wiring.

My question...does anyone have an exact figure on the length of the 
fuel line between the tank and the engine?

I know, I know...fuel line doesn't cost that much, just buy extra.  It 
will take my FLAPS 24 hours to get good line and I'm wondering if the 
piece I have will fit.  I don't want to get under there and realize I'm 
3 inches short.  Although that would be the theme of my life.

Thanks,
mjr
