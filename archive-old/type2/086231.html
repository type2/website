Subject: Main Harness - how difficult to replace

I did yhis with my bus Spooky.

It is a darn fiddley job and carefull marking up before removing is a good 
idea, when I say good, I really mean essential....

I stripped Spooky down to nothing so access was relatively easy.

One thing I will mention is the conduit that the loom runs in through the 
centre section. On Spooky this was corroded and I replaced it. Had I left it 
I would never have pushed the loom back through. I had replaced the belly 
pans as well again making access easy.

It can be done but wait for a good karma day and keep a pack of plasters 
(bandaids) at the ready, oh and have a priest stand close to deter the 
swearing!!!

Good luck

Mike
