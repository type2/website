Content-type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I'm trying to sell my '77 Westy.  My wife and I are moving to Florida this
Summer and have too many cars to move.  Plus the added expense of moving
means we should sell the Camper. 

Marigold yellow, excellent shape cosmetically and mechanically, just
passed state inspection and emissions testing.  Poptop, sink, icebox, and
rear table.

Contact me for more details.
