&gt; I just looked-up the accounting of my T2 ownership.  I have owned my 
&gt; bus for 53 months.  During that time,
&gt; besides gasoline and my or my son's labor time, some $6,534 has been 
&gt; spent on bus-related invoices.  I
&gt; purchased the bus for $1,000, making the total direct expenditures 
&gt; $7,534.  We have had the engine out of
&gt; the vehicle 5 times.

Since I am guilty of being the less-than-charitable listee, I stand 
corrected. But could you break down those expenses a little bit? Why 
was the engine out 5 times?
