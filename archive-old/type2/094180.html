Subject: Re: [T2] messy wiring

Hi Tara,

Rule # 1 : Don't fix what ain't broke.

Rule #2 :  One thing at a time.

Download the appropriate wiring diagrams for your bus from the library at
type2_dot_com, and print out the sections that you are troubleshooting.
Trouble-shoot each circuit independently until you have resolved all of your
issues. Then carefully put everything back as neatly as possible.

If it's just the mess that's the problem get some velcro cable ties from the
local stereo store and string them back up. But be careful not to pull
anything loose in the process.

If you just start pulling wires helter-skelter and expect to be able to
remember how to put it back tomorrow or the next day you will soon find
yourself in a world of hurt.

Happy trails,

*&gt; Hi there!
*&gt; This is my first time to the list. I have a huge mess of wires underneath
*&gt; my steering wheel. I haven't had my bus for long but I've been putting
*&gt; this off because I know the headache it's going to be.  Does anyone
*&gt; have any suggestions on how I should approach this mess?  Thanks
