Well...you all sound surprised......
Isn't amerika the land where VW shows have Miss Bikini as a featured
attraction?
Thank the Pon that over here (for the moment at least) the vans are still the
crowd pullers...though Miss wet t shirt seems to be creeping in to a few
shows....
BTW Steve and Cath - the SSVC mag would love to print a real picture of a bus
and its proud owners - our readers like curves of perfectly shaped metal - but
I spose the Brits always were a bit perverse...
