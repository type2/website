Subject: Web Cam Inc

I haven't been able to get to their web site for a while now - it comes up 
with some search engine.  I just called them and they said they have a new 
web address: http://www.webcamshafts_dot_com or http://www.webcaminc_dot_net.  They 
said they paid for their old domain name for ten years but something got 
fouled up and it was &quot;stolen&quot; by a guy overseas and he refuses to give it 
back and wants to charge them money to put a forwarding link on the old 
page (webcaminc_dot_com).  So they are still in business and would like 
everyone to be aware of that fact.  :-)  I don't want them to go away 
either because I need one of their cams for my next engine!  Anyone have an 
opinion of the 91 vs. 107i grind in a mild 2-liter hydraulic motor?  I'm 
leaning towards the 107i because I want a stock idle and decent torque down 
low.  I also want whatever is closest to the stock 914 cam since Mike 
Gensler's works so well, but I can't find the 914 cam specs to compare.
