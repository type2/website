Subject: Do two thin wires = one thick wire

I know, I know, this thread has gone much too far, but I've wondered this.
I'm not an electrical engineer (that was my major 25 years ago but realized
I hated math.) I have always been fascinated by electricity (my dad is a ham
like Mr Lyle, and I grew up around electrical gadgets)

Wouldn't using 4 or 5 16 gage wires, unless stripped and wrapped together,
have 4 or 5 times the resistance?  Even though the current would be the
same, each of the small wires would probably get pretty hot.

Awesome idea about the jumper cables.  Can't believe I never thought of it.
