Subject: Re: [T2] Chrome or White Emblem on '73 Standard Bus

&gt; Didn't all buses get chrome except for the
&gt; westfalias which were white?

No, all buses had Pastell White L90D emblems (1973 and
up). Only the Deluxe microbus had a 'chrome' emblem.

However, most (perhaps 'all') USA microbuses were
delivered with a US-chrome package (M521) which
included the chrome emblem.

The 1973-1979 emblem was also available in:

- black (for certain German authorities)
- olive (for army vehicles)

Those are the only ones that are mentioned in the
parts catalogue and the only ones I have seen for
real.


yours,


Vincent
