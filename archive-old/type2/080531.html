&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I have just become a lucky owner of my first car, a
&gt; volkswagen transporter 
&gt; 73.

Congrads, you bought a good first car. 

&gt; The car is in very good condition, well etleast the
&gt; body of the car.
&gt; I have searched the car all over and I can´t find
&gt; any signs of rust and all 
&gt; of the doors works good.

Rust is the biggest problem, make sure you check the
font axle for rust, use a screw driver and poke
around.

&gt; Now over to the not so good things about my bus:
&gt; 
&gt; First of all is the cables, they are old(very old)
&gt; and the are just a mess. 

Do you mean electrical wires?

&gt; And some of them are not working as well, so I guess
&gt; I have to replace all 
&gt; the cables to new ones and maybe some other
&gt; electrical stuff. The old owner 
&gt; has started the job but got stuck so he just left it
&gt; in a complete mess.
&gt; And now I wonder how hard it is to replace all the
&gt; cables for a beginner, 
&gt; how much it costs and if you need a lot of speciall
&gt; tools for the job?

If you do mean wires, then as someone pointed out
earlier, its not that hard, just time consuming. 
Being methodical and replacing one wire at a time
using a wiring diagram (color)is the way I would
approach the job.
&gt; 
&gt; The second thing is the engine, the problem there is
&gt; that it´s out of the 
&gt; car and I have to get the engine home to my place
&gt; and then install it in the 
&gt; car. 

I think this is the best place for the engine to be if
you plan on keeping this transporter for a while.  You
can clean the engine of all grease, paint your engine
tin, inspect it for any problems.  This is also a good
time to replace ALL the fuel lines.  The biggest
safety concern with buses is old fuel lines breaking
and causing a fire.  With the engine out it is much
easier to replace the lines.  It is also a good time
to remove the old fuel filter.  First allow the
contents of the tank to drain through the fuel filter
into a suitable container (remember this is a fire
hazard, no smoking :) After the tank is drained, cut
the fuel filter open with a hack saw and inspect the
filter.  If it has a lot of rust particles then now is
the time to remove the gas tank and have it cleaned
and resealed.  If there is no rust in the filter,
smile a big smile and replace the fuel line.  


Now remember that I am a beginner in vw-busses
&gt; and I have no ideá of 
&gt; how I should do to get the engine back into the car.
&gt; There must be some homepages on the internett on
&gt; this issue but a haven´t 
&gt; fund any.

Ah but you have found a good Internet resources, first
is the Type2_dot_com and all the info in the library. 
Spend a night or two reading articles about engine
removal and replacement, gas line replacement,
electrical works, and CV replacement.

The CVs are constant velocity joints which alow the
axle coming from the engine/trany to move with the up
down motion of the rear wheels.  These joints get worn
over time and often need to be replaced, again the
engine out is the time to do this.  You will also need
to be familiar with how to re-attach them when you put
your engine back in.  Don't worry its pretty easy and
you get to look like a grease monkey when you come
back inside (for those of us who are forced into a
suit and tie all week, looking like a grease monkey on
the weekends is the most fun part of the week)
&gt; 
&gt; So what do you think? Am I just a complete fool that
&gt; takes a car home that 
&gt; doesn´t even work or are these problems easy to fix
&gt; even for a beginner?
&gt; Maybe I also should tell that I bought the bus from
&gt; a old friend so I know 
&gt; that the engine works and that the buss is ok (or
&gt; at least was?)

Of course your not a fool,(unless you need this bus
running by Monday or you loose your job) VWs are fun
and I believe that everyone should learn about engines
by buying motorcycles, snowmobiles or VWs that are
non-functioning.  It will give you a real sense of
accomplishment to see your first sunset through a bay
window while traveling westbound in the slow lane.

&gt; So now I am in a situation where I need all(and I
&gt; mean all) the information 
&gt; I can get.
&gt; I hope you all understand my questions and I am
&gt; sorry for my poor englich.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!!

Keep asking questions and myself and many more on this
list with brighter minds than me will always be glad
to help.  And I promise a more concise answer next
time.

Best of luck and Happy Holidays,
Rick
