Subject: Re: How many miles... 

My '78 bus odometer said about 70,000 when I got it. Former owner said an even
former owner had disconnected the speedometer, so this number was low.
he implied it only had 70,000 miles on it, but I suspect the mileage is
true, it's 170,000, and he was telling tales. Especially
since I have all the original repair records, which indicate mileage.
The bottom end was really worn out when I rebuilt it, and I don't think
that could happen in just 70,000 miles.

I've run it up to about 190,000 now. 

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
