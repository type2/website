X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

The phone number was posted wrong. It should be 949-581-1256.
That was for a 72 westy with 2.0/hyd &amp; weber smog exempt with Mercedes alloys 
located in El Toro California. I have had bus for several years and the 
thrill is gone. Sold my 69 loaf, sold by bug now westy is on the block.
