Hi Volks,

The weather in Southern Ontario has now stabilized, and the weekend  
is shaping up for a spectacular winter campout. The park staff  
reports that about a foot of fresh now has fallen and there is 10  
inches of ice on the lake; perfect for skating, pond hockey and cross  
country skiing.

There are already some brave souls from Ohio on route to the campout;  
I myself plan to arrive at the park tomorrow AM around 11. We also  
have at least two hard-core westy owners whose rides are out of  
action and they are insisting on camping with us regardless. Their  
plan is to be pitching tents and driving alternate transportation; I  
say fine with me and the more the merrier! Anyone who is that  
determined to hang out with bus folk is definitely welcome at my  
campfire.

If you need further details, p-mail me or visit the website:
www.pottsfamily_dot_ca/The_Bug_Pack/TCWBC/

If you need to reach me after 10AM tomorrow, call my cell at (416)  
735-1236, or email my blackberry using gpotts_AT_ernestgreen_dot_com


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
