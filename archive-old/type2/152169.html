Subject: Re: [T2] ?? coil with Pertronix

well it's getting apparent that my stock coil is getting weak, probably
time for a replacement.  I have had a Pertronix points replacement in my
dizzy for years and have used the stock coil that I know is at least 15
years old.

  what is a good coil for replacement, would probably just go with a stock
coil on my 78 2liter mostly stock engine but would a different coil give a
little hotter spark

thanks
Bob
