Agreed, however for a little more than the cost of a spare dizzy, you could
keep a spare Petronix in the glovebox. This is assuming that the Petronix is
what went out and not the dizzy itself. But on the other hand maybe a spare
dizzy would be good for that very reason.... but on the other hand ......
why do I have a sudden urge to rent Fiddler on the Roof?

We have one of these electronic ignitions in a bus that is a daily driver,
and we have had really good results with it, but I think that it is a good
idea to carry a set of points with you &quot;just in case&quot;. One day it will be
kaput, as with all things electronic, and it's emergency kit and know-how,
or a tow. Best would be a spare dizzy with points installed. Jan B
