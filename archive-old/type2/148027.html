Subject: Re: [T2] garage door height?

&lt;I have a standard 78 bus but have a canoe on the roof, for safety I had it
measured and WITH the canoe it was 7ft 3in.&gt;

The way I make my '78 Westy with rooftop intercoolers, oil coolers, and satellite dish on top is I approach the garage door at 25 mph, as I reach the door frame I slam on the brakes making the front end dive. As the center of the bus is under the door frame I tap the turbo boost button on the dash causing the bus to accelerate and the rear end squats. Once through the door I have 8 ft to slow from 35 mph to stop... Has worked well for me for some time but my buddy who also has a '78 and the same height door has had alot of trouble with this technique. Currently he is on his 8th door and 5th Westy. Last I heard he was considering putting hydraulic cylinders under his house to raise it 6 inches when he needs to enter the bus into the garage... 

suggestions: mondo brakes, self stick non-slip pads on driveway and garage floor for traction, large electric motors from locomotive for temporary hard acceleration, etc etc...
