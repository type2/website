Subject: Re: [T2] 15&quot; rims for my '78 Westy

&lt;&lt; Tire Rack and others sell Mercedes steel rims for their snow tire 
packages. 
Less than $40 per wheel. Should have correct or nearly correct offsets.  &gt;&gt;

I've got M-B alloys on my Bay, but it's not quite a bolt-on...The M-B uses
lug bolts, not lug nuts, so if the steel wheel replaces the alloy exactly,
you'll hafta do a little machining to match them up to a VW...
