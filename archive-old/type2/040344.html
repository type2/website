Subject: heater operation vs. engine cooling

Kim,

On a water cooled car, heat on makes a difference.  It's like adding a
second radiator (the heater coil), but on an air cooled car, it does
*not* make any difference.  

What does make a difference is whether your heat system is sealed and
connected with all tin in place (even the under- cylinder tin) and the
engine seal in place.  The VW heater system scavenges heat from the
exhaust pipes, and that heat is always on, whether you use it or not.  
the important thing is to keep that heat from getting back to the intake
and that is what the tin and seal are there to do.
