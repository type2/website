RE: [T2] more on exhaust leaks/poppingNo burnt valves here. I took a look at
them while the manifolds were off and just did a compression
test. 140 on three cylinders and 135 on the other.

  Hate to say this but a bad exhaust valve could be the culprit, do a
compression test and see if your getting good numbers, a burnt exhaust valve
could easily do this.
