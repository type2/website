Subject: More dizzy woes

I'm still trying to figure out how to get my distributor on my 69 (stock 205T) 
work. I installed the dizzy with new clamp and even put four spacers under the 
drive gear but it still doesn't mate up with the distributor. I can push on the 
rotor and there is some axial play and I can get it to mate up but the spring 
on top of the drive gear just pushes it up again and there is too much 
clearance. Any suggestions on where to find one of these 3mm shims? Also how do 
I do a cross post to the VB list without signing up to their list?
