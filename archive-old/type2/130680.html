Subject: Batteries........

Hiya All,

Time to buy a new battery for the Duck.

Seems to me that a little while back someone mentioned that a Group 41 could 
be used instead of the usual Group 42.  Anybody recall that?

So... what were the advantages to using a Group 41?  Has anybody out there 
gone this route?  Testimonials?  Condemnations?  Pathetic indifference?

And FWIW, the Duck is not a camper, just a wonderful big ol' Bus that waddles 
down the highway.  When it has a good battery.

Mike
