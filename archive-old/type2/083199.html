Subject: cutting out at startup

hello,

recently i installed a head temp sensor on my 76
Westy. i insatalled it on Cyl. 3 as i understand that
this the hottest cylinder. i recently damaged the
sendor wire doing a compression test. i repaired it
with some heat resistant exhaust tape and seems to be
well. however, since i have re-installed this wire the
bus has begun cutting out at start up. it will start
fine and then promptly die out. upon a second start it
usually does fine. what could causing this?

as always thanks in advance!! any and all answers,
opinions or insights will be greatly appreciated!!

BTW- on the diesel conversion note, i have found a 1.8
litre Turbo diesel engine from a Quantum. according to
the guys at the shop this engine &quot;runs and drives&quot;.
owner wants $550 does this seem like a reasonable
price to anyone who &quot;Knows&quot;.  i am also in search of a
drive train from a diesel vanagon, or a parts diesel
van. thanks !!
