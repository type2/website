Subject: Re: [T2] Can anyone give this guy some advice ?

David at BugJunction sends:

&gt; i set all the valves and  triple checked them after  hand spining the motor.
&gt; it seem  a little  tight  /with the plugs  out / i thought it was because  of
&gt; the new parts.

I'm betting the rods are on wrong--how much do you want to bet he didn't do
the &quot;drop test&quot; on his rods (install the rod, torque it down, put a little
pad in the cylinder spigot right under the rod, pick up the little end and
let loose; it should drop freely) before he put the pistons and jugs on?
