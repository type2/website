&gt;Here I am wondering if I am going to have major problems with the lifters if

Hydraulic lifters all have a unique personalities. ;-)

Warm up the engine at 11pm the night before you do the adjustment to be sure they are pumped up in the morning. Take it for a drive if you can.

&gt;also, am I'm going to turn 2 full turns after contact when adjusting or 1 
&gt;full turn...what is the correct turns (full or half turns) when adjusting hyd. 
&gt;valves on an engine with 60K miles on it?

I read in the archives that the lifter travel was measured to be 4mm. Since the threads of the adjusting screws are 1mm pitch, 2 turns would put the lifter in the middle of it's travel, an adjustment that Bentley suggests.

I understand the logic but it would since metal expands when heated (pushrods) and this would push the lifter piston a little more off center. Another reason they used steel for the pushrods in hydraulic engines? Anyway, VW engineers weren't dummies so they must have considered this and I have to question the 4mm measurement.

I can tell you from experience that 1.5 turns is just as quiet as 2 turns, as least to my ear.
