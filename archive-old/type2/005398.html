I use 30 weight in the winter and 40 weight in the summer, here in Fresno
Calif.
For interesting reading on muli-grade oil, go here and read the section on
''Viscosity Index Improvers&quot; and then think of all the posts that said 'my
engine runs at 250 degrees.......'
Now, this was written in 1992 but I have not seen or heard of any new and
improved polymers......

I wrote to Castrol 3 years ago and asked how they can back up their slogan
that is printed on every quart of their oil = Maximum Protection Against
Thermal Breakdown
Maybe they have a new polymer out??  I don't have a clue... they won't reply
to my questions.
Here is another oil info site. It also talks of multi-grade.....
