Subject: Parts sent: Westy Tow?

Okay guys like the rest of my life right now thw whirlwind has not subsided. 
In all the fiascos of trying to move across country, sell off my parts and 
vehicles, I lost the emails from those who requested parts. Robert Mead and 
Chuck Shultz, yours went out today along with some others. More tomorrow. 
But like I told you guys please don't send me money for the parts or the 
shipping, just make a donation to the list. Although I can always use more 
cash for the move, we can all benefit from the list. Let's keep it going. 
Sorry for the wait but like I said it has been crasy. Enjoy the parts and I 
hope they help you out.

As for el Verde, I have not found any local takers even though several have 
pondered and nothing has happened. A few offers have been made but none 
worth giving her away for. I would rather pay the extra money to get her 
there.

Question: Anyone ever moved with a full, big(20-25) moving truck and towed a 
Westy behind it? This is what I am faced with now and am ready to try. Let 
me know.

Thanks to all,

Michael Knight
