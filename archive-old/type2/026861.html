Help!
  It seems the new millenium is not starting off at all well for me.
  My g/f passed last month of a brain anurizm, and now it seems my mother is 
not doing well either.

  I'm not here to whine though, I'm here to sell a bus... she's a 1978 
standard microbus, less than 75k original miles, she needs a bit of tlc, but 
she's never left me stranded, I'm the 3rd owner, bought her in San Diego 3 
yrs ago, from a very caring 2nd owner.

  I have to sell her fast, unfortunately I just can't afford to take her 
back to Oklahoma with me, I'm willing to let her go at a VERY reasonable 
price to a good home!

  Serious inquries only please...  541-574-8764  ask for Mike....
