&gt; Using a longer piece of hose than is already there reroute the crankcase
&gt; fumes out of the compartment via a &quot;road draft tube&quot;.  Standard
&gt; fitment/procedure for most older vehicles.  Just remove the preheated air
&gt; hose from the air cleaner, temporarily, and route the road draft tube
under
&gt; the engine tin through that opening.  After the test replace the hoses in
&gt; the appropriate arrangement.

Of course, if you try this in an area which has a visual inspection before
the actual emissions inspection (such as here in northern VA) you will fail
the test before it's even begun, as the tech will be looking for proper
crankcase ventilation and will see that you have rigged it up to 1950s
standards, and will fail you.  Of course this depends both on the competence
level and integrity level of the tech.

An engine in good tune should have no trouble passing emissions with the
crankcase breather operating as stock.  If your engine is in such poor
condition that the crankcase breather feeds tons of oily vapor to the air
intake because of blowby, then it's time to do some work on the engine :-)
