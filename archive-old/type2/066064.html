Subject: CO interior emissions

For The Record, CO is odorless, tasteless and colorless.

This does NOT mean that because you have odor, you don't have CO.

Compare your interior smell to that coming out of the exhaust pipe (it is
only necessary to put your nose near the exhaust stream).  This is not
entirely definative, becuase several reactions may take place after the
point of entry into the heating system but before the end of the exhaust
pipe, thus changing the character (i.e. smell) of the exhaust stream.

Having also stinky heater system but being too lazy so just wearing lots of
clothes,
Eric
