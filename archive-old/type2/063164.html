Subject: Ultra Rare Single Cab Middle Seat

Hi All,

I have a very rare option on 'Zorm', my 58 Euro Single Cab: a 2/3 middle
seat in the back bed!

Well, ok.  I was just hauling it home, but it's an interesting concept,
pre-dating the Beverly Hillbilly's Granny-chair!  Who needs Safari
Windows to ride with the wind in your face when you can have that open
wind feeling as a passenger riding high in the back of a Single Cab. 8-)
