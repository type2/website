Subject: Re: [T2] FLAPS

&gt;Interesting thought, the FLAPS clerk mentioned that the glass-encased
&gt;GBC-style fuses were safer than the older style because it was possible for
&gt;the older style fuse to act as an igniter if it blew while there were
&gt;volatile fumes in the vehicle.
&gt;
&gt;Is this another S.H.T.I.C.K., or based in fact?

I hate those glass replacements. You can't verify them without taking them 
out and checking with an ohm meter. The spec fuzes show themselves.

As to starting fires, since WWII, millions if not billions of the GBC's 
have been in use on most Euro vehicles worldwide, and if they were such a 
problem in any sense, you couldn't say that. Note also that the modern type 
plug in fuzes are also open to atmosphere so would be no less of a problem 
if fumes were of concern. Watch out for plastic bodied replacements. 
Ceramic bodies only, please.
