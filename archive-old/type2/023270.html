Subject: ah, yet another snag
Mime-Version: 1.0

well, the bus failed safety inspection...badly i might add.

the fan wasn't hooked up (and one lever was missing,) so...no defrost on 
the windshield.
some bushing between the steering column and the gearbox is damaged.
the master cylinder (that i just replaced with a remanuf. one) is leaking 
somewhere.
the rear wheel brake cylinder (which i also replaced) is leaking.
the is a leak in the exhaust.

and get this...he said that 1 out of 4 side marker lights is 
working.  well, as far as i know, the front door markers are solely 
reflectors, the rear ones have lights.  it is clear (since the door panels 
are off) that there is no electrical wires in the vicinity of these 
reflectors....whatever.

i have already removed the rear brake 3 times in this process.  the wheel 
cylinders in the rear were brand new.  unfortunately, i tore a hole in the 
dust covers in the process of installing the new shoes.  i also pushed the 
cylinder past the valve and caused the cylinder to collect fluid in the 
dust cover.  i took it apart on sunday because...i was rechecking the 
brakes and nothing in there was dry after driving it for 20 miles.  the 
pass. side was fine.

**what are the main problems related to brake fluid leaking around the 
master cylinder?**  i'm hoping i can determine the issues this evening, so 
i can order more parts and get them by next week.  the hose from the upper 
reservoir to the main container on the master cyl. was old, but i neglected 
to replace it.

i have no clue as to what the guy is referring to in the steering.  my 
better half took the vehicle for the inspection...so no arguements involved 
on my part.
