Go hand in hand. You are retarding the engine!

You CANNOT static time a dual vacuum unit distributor
to the timing spec listed. 
* I am ASSUMING you have a dual vacuum unit distbutor
even though you did not mention the year, the engine,
or the dist you have.

Any time you have a timing spec that calls for 5 or 10
ATDC, this means it:
1) has to be running,
2) has to have manifold vacuum going to the retard
side,
3) has to have a working retard vacuum unit and a
moving throttle plate, and
4) MUST be timed with a timing light.

If none of the above, time it to 7.5 before.
