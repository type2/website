I've written in the past about my experience with the Soundown lead/foam
composite in the engine room of a power cruiser.  The material in our
application was 1 1/2&quot;, applied to the inside walls and overhead of an
engine enclosure containing a 327 Corvette V-8 engine replacing the original
283 Chev/ChrisCraft V-8.  This material transformed the powerplant from
being, quite literally, too noisy to endure to a mellow purr.

The Soundown lead/foam composite is not cheap, but it is definitely
effective.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  A friend of mine who is an avid motorboater heard me talking about the
old sounddampening issue dear to our hearts, and dug these links up.  I've
requested a sample from the first, but now you know all that I know.  Has
anyone used any of the products?  &lt;&lt;
