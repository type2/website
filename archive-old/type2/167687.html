&gt; I think that is a very optimistic approach. If cars stopped rusting,

maybe that is the Saturn and Deloren problem, they don't rust..
stainless steel', and plastics mostly, now my bus on the other hand
makes up for every Delorean ever built in the volumne of rust
produced.   if  some one asked me how much my bus weighs it would be a
moving target between the rusty stuff coming off and the new metal
going on. at some point I think the only original piece left that came
from Hamburg might be the steering wheel...I think it is still
original.
