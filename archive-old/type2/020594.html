    Hi list,

    I have a 78 T2 with a problem that's driving me nuts!!! First off
let me explain i'm as dumb as a rock when it comes to electrical
problems.
    My bus has a habit of not starting every so often (sometimes once a
week, sometimes less, and sometimes more), and after 3 or 4 tries at
starting it the battery goes dead (only spinning the engine over no more
than 5 seconds at time).
    Engine is in tune, replaced alternator  six month ago, red light
would flash dimly with head lights on and turn signal on. Got tried of
that game finally and replaced starter last Thursday after after having
to jump start it. After changing the starter I had a bright red light(
!_at_$%^&amp;).
    Ok I say, Game is over. Out comes the wallet New Alt. New Reg. New
Batt.(all remanufactured of course). Cables were replaced Six month ago.
After all that Fire that sucker up ( crossed fingers, knocked on wood)
pulsing red light, Put old reg. back in dim pulsing light. ( almost like
the cursor flashing in front of me). HELP what am I doing wrong, right.
don't know where to go from here.
    Thank you for giving us place ask questions and get valuable info on
this little addiction that we have.

Thanks again,
Chuck Beck
