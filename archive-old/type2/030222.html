&gt; I like your creative use of adjectives.  Is &quot;boogered&quot; an American

Hmmm.... nope....  as I was growing up, there were a number of different
terms used for differing types of failure.  Boogered probably derives more
from booger, as in dried snot.  The mating surfaces of the nut-hub-spacer
stack each have a raised burr from being pounded against each other on
their outer edges, like the rim of snot that forms on a kid's nostrils
when they have a cold.

Another favorite mechanical term of failure for me is &quot;wallered&quot; with
variant forms &quot;wallered out&quot; and &quot;cattywallered&quot; all of which probably
derives from a hog wallow...  it describes the gouges that form in the
race of a very worn CV or the irregular oversize of a plain bearing that
has run for a long time with a undersized shaft.  Basically a race or
bearing surface that has had an irregular trench or divot worn into it is
wallered or wallered out.  Holes can also be wallered out, if subjected to
prolonged vibration.

I don't think either of these terms is generally &quot;American.&quot;  I
believe both to be regional and southern American rather than in general
use (tho I am willing to be proved wrong :-)

If anyone has further regional mechanic's words, or even national
words[1], let me know with definition and folk etymology if you know it
and I will report next Friday (assuming, of course, that I can find an
internet connection next Friday)

[1] If I don't get at least one good definition of &quot;bodge&quot;, I will be
*extremely* dissappointed!!! :-)
