Subject: Re: [T2] 1800 heads

We have new T-4 heads. Previously they had only been available in square
port, but we are having them made in oval port models now. The finish work
is superb. I just had 2 sets flow tested, but these aren't &quot;bus&quot; heads!

These are made by Remmele, and the quality is outstanding (unmatched from
any I've seen). We are the North/South American distributor for these, but
they aren't &quot;budget&quot; heads either, but if you want NICE replacement heads,
look no further.
