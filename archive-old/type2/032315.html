&gt; So.  I come to the crossroads once again of which cliff to push this thing
&gt; off of.  Anybody got any ideas?

You tell a very good story that has an unhappy ending and it's definitely
too far to bring your bus to the Pacific Northwest.  There's a really cool
cliff (about 1500') up at a place called &quot;Bald Mtn. out here. :)
Seriously tho, there are other conditions that could cause your Bus to
&quot;seem&quot; to lose power, other than a motor. (optimist here)  Brakes and/or
big wheel bearing seizes from overheating?  Best of luck anyway, and I did
like the hard luck story!
