Subject: 1980 alternator install question
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi listees,

I have a question about the alternator in my 80 westy.  Next to the voltage 
regulator plug (on the D+ end) is a single contact labeled +.  Should this be 
connected to anything?  Could this be the reason my alternator is not 
working?  Thought I should ask before installing the new one.

TIA,
Brew
