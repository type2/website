  Call around and find a shop that rebuilds alternators - every town has a 
couple. Ask what they charge (no pun) to test your's. Advance Auto (used 
to work there) has a machine that relies on pigtails to idiot proof their 
machine. When I worked there only a couple of us even knew what an 
alternator was supposed to do for a car, let alone how it worked. 

You might also call Napa or a Mom and Pop parts store (we have an ancient 
one with the same guys that have been selling parts for 50 years) and see 
if they have a tester. These stores typically have people who know 
something about cars and their parts.

See ya!
