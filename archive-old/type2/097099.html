Subject: drilling for thermostat mounting stud

Hi Type2 Folks,
    I have a new 1600 engine to put into our '71 westy.  There is no
hole drilled for the stud to mount the thermostat.  While I feel I'm
proficient enough at drilling and tapping holes to do the job, it
can't hurt to gather info before hand.  I'm wondering if anyone has
ever done this to a fully assembled engine and if so are there any
hints or tips to make sure I get it right?
    The engine is not in the bus yet and will be up on a workbench at
a good height to work on.  I've got some good sharp drill bits and an
8 x 1.25 mm tap.  Anything special I should know before I center
punch, drill, and tap the hole?  This is in a brand new aluminum case
if that makes a difference.
