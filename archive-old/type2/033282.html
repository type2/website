Subject: Re: back to my tranny problem, (Automatic)

Volks

well I am back from my honeymoon and the nagging problem of a leaky
tranny.  this is a 78 FI auto tranny that got a new torque convertor and
seal when I put this tranny in back in August....she runs fine but about a
month ago she started leaking.... thought it was a bad seal, even bought a
new one, but in looking closely and actually watching it. the leak is
coming from the joint between the tranny itself and the final drive.

????? couple questions.

. is it possible to get the &quot;tranny&quot; out without pulling the final drive
or engine...?
. does this seal/gasket even exsist??  where??
. any &quot;external&quot; leak stopper &quot;goop&quot; that might work???? (even something
permanently sealing the units together, have never had to seperate one in
30 years of driving VW's)

ideas,  really don't want to pull this engine again, she is my daily
driver, it is 18F degrees outside and I can't pull the engine in my SMALL
garage.  


thanks
Bob
