Message-Id: &lt;3.0.1.16.19991011111626.39477410_at_mail2.spsu_dot_edu&gt;

I have been searching for NEW type IV 2.0l square exhaust port heads 
for a couple of weeks now and here are the options I have found.

new VW German bare heads from Riechert Tuning in Germany for $330/ea

new AMC Spain complete heads from FLAPS for $350/ea

new VW Mexico complete heads from FLAPS for $365/ea

new Marnal USA compete heads from FLAPS for $365/ea

Has ANYONE in the US purchased heads from Riechert in Germany?  Would 
ANYONE be interested in a group purchase of these original German 
castings?

I was unaware of the Mexican or USA castings of type IV cylinder heads.  
Has ANYONE seen or had experience with these castings?

Dave
