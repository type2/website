Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Interior!

Todd,

Tou might consider using just the front piece for a sunroof model. It
is available seperately,
What was this van originally? Camper with plywoog ceiling, or perf
vinyl throughout?

&gt; Hahah... So,
&gt; that said, I only will need (and want) headliner for the front. My question is
&gt; (sorry this is long winded), can I buy just the &quot;Bus Truck&quot; headliner for my
&gt; 73 Bus if I only plan to install headliner for the front? Or will I still need
&gt; to get the entire full headliner kit for a complete Bus?
