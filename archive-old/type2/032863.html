Ron,
First off, I happen to have a York compressor sitting on the shelf with a good
clutch if need be.
Secondly, I would like to find out more about that bracket to fit the Sanden
compressor where the York used to be.

I can't speak about the fit of the engine tin with the modification.

In researching compressors (in preparation of putting AC into my 2.0L type IV
powered '60 double cab), I found that all the recommendations pointed to the
use of the more efficient Sanden compressor  (I think SD-508 is a typical part
number).  The York compressor is a two piston unit that looks just like a small
two piston internal combustion engine when you open it up.  The Sanden is a
little different makeup with something that looks like pistons around the
radius.  The part number tells you a lot about the unit.  SD-508, I know the 5
refers to the 5 small pistons and the 8 relates to the size/capacity of the
unit.

&gt;From all reports, you will be much happier with the Sanden unit.  Much more
efficient (less drag on the engine) than the old York.

As far as my project goes, I guess I have the winter &amp; spring to figure out how
to mount the compressor and get the belts to it.  The type IV motor is in the
upright configuration and it looks like I might have to go to some sort of
serpentine belt arrangement.  Any info on the brackets that your mechanic has
access to would be greatly appreciated.

Scott
