Subject: Re: CV Boot Clamps

&gt;I don't know if this is right or not and would like for someone to tell me,
&gt;but i just put on new C Vs and was told not to use a clamp at the center
&gt;of the shaft. They said that the boot fits so tight there that clamps are
no
&gt;longer used.

I replaced my CV boots in 1996 and used no center clamps.  There has been no
noticeable ill effect during this time, and I have not had any loss of
grease products.
