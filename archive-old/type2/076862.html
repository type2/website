Rob,

Congratulations on getting your BN4.  When you get it running right, =
you'll be amazed at the heat it puts out.  I've read temps as high as =
220F at the end of a flexible heater vent hose I use to run the hot air =
up to the front of my bus. =20

- I don't have the recirculating ductwork, so I'm not familiar with it.  =


- The fresh air intake pipe will be hard to find.  Keep your eyes peeled =
at junkyards, or maybe make your own.  It's just a thin-walled bent pipe =
with a flange about an inch from the end that bolts into a hole in the =
left battery tray.  (I can send you pictures if you need.)

- For the flexible intake hose from the intake pipe to the intake on the =
bottom of the heater I just went to my flaps and they had a 1&quot; (I think) =
flexible foil hose.  I think it's what some older cars use for carb heat =
or something like that.  Anyway, not too hard to find. =20

- You are correct, you do not block off the fresh combustion air intake =
if you use the recurculating duct.  As for a rectangular to round =
adapter, I think those were only found on Westfalias (with BN4s) as the =
heat had to be ducted from the outlet through the cabinet under the rear =
seat (not familiar with Westies, just saw this setup once, seemed to be =
original). =20

- As for installation instructions, Rick Taylor (who I think replied to =
your post already) put on a seminar about a year ago for some fortunate =
folks that were in his area.  He was thoughful enough to videotape it =
and make copies of tech data available through KC Kombies (I think...) =
to the rest of us on the list.  I bought the video and early BN4 manual =
that has what seem to be instructions for dealers to install BN4s.  =
Includes templates on where to cut for ducting, how to route the control =
cable and wiring, and other pertinent information for non-factory =
installation.  Excellent resource (thanks again Rick).

- You've obviously found Ron VanNess' outstanding articles in the =
library.  I recommend you follow them and do a thorough checkout on your =
heater.  (Looks like you already did from your webpage - braver than I =
am to take it apart that much!)  I recently used his procedure to =
replace the fuel pressure regulator diaphragm on my heater and it worked =
(made the difference between it working or not.)  If you do this, I =
bought a rather large piece of buna-N fuel resistant rubber sheeting to =
make these diaphragms and have plenty of material left over.  If you =
need some let me know, I'll send you some. =20

- By the way, what is the CD ROM you have in the pictures with your =
heater?

Keep in touch; it helps to bounce ideas and information off each other =
on these heaters.  I think John Baker (listmember) also just got his =
heater running, too.  (Any Canadians out there with BN4's?  My =
bus/heater came from Calgary - sort of with my wife...)

Good luck on your heater!
