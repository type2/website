Hi Volks,

I'm still having a hard time adjusting my valves.

Question:  Is it possible for a dizzy to be put in incorrectly? As in the
mark that should point to cylnder 1 being TDC is actually pointing to
cylnder 3 being TDC?

The reason I ask is that last night I turned the flywheel until the rotor
faced what I believed to be the mark in the dizzy. It is about 20 degrees
counterclockwise to the cutout notch in the dizzy.  (The cutout notch in the
dizzy is facing towards the oil dipstick) When I set the rotor to this TDC
mark, the flywheel notch read at 21 degrees BTDC.  I moved the flywheel a
few degrees until the notch was at 0 degrees and the rotor still pointed in
the general direction of the mark in the dizzy.  I popped off the valve
cover on the right (passenger) side and checked the valves.

[See diagram below for my numbering system]

1,2 were tight (for sure) and I think 3 was as well, while 4 was loose.  It
could have been 4 was the tight one and 3 was loose, but 1 and 2 were
definitely tight.  (I fussed with the valves a lot last night and lost some
details in my frustration)

Tonight, I moved the flywheeel to TDC at 0 but the rotor faced directly
opposite of the TDC mark in the dizzy and valves 1,2 and 3 were loose!

I looked again at the info from the Type2 library about doing the valves,
but it wasn't fool proof enough to save me from myself.  I guessed/compiled
the chart below from information in Brian Verbeek's Quick Valve Adjust
instructions.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong on the open
valves at the different TDCs!

Help!

Thanks Volks!

P.s. I just got the replies to my earlier post!  Thanks!  I'm pretty sure
that I wasn't really at TDC for #1, but I was supposed to be according to my
books!  I can try the pencil thing, but I've got to get to the plugs first.
It's a 72 (no upper hatch) and I only have about 2 hours after work that I
can work on my bus before I freeze in the dark. (I've no garage, just an off
street, unlevel, uncovered, unlit parking slip on the edge of a noisy road.)
