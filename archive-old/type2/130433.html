Subject: Fuel injector spares?

Does anyone have a couple of 2.0L fuel injectors that they would be 
willing to part with for a reasonable price?

I have a '79 california emissions bus.  I am fighting head problems and 
high cylinder head temperatures, so I plan to send my injectors in to 
be cleaned and flow tested.  Gary suggested that I send a couple of 
spares along with my original set so that if one of my originals cannot 
be made to work, they have others to work with.

Thanks,

Tim
