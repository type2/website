If you mean the piece of tin itself, I think the answer is no, not new
anyway.  If the question regards the little gasket for it, the answer is
likewise no.  In either case, you could easily fabricate a replacement.
If you use silicone, be careful that you do not prevent the little flaps
&gt;from flapping.  What?  No flaps either?  Fabricate those.  It's not
rocket science.  :  )
