Subject: Re: Water based heater in an aircooled 

Thanks for all the interest in my heater. I am sorry that I haven't
responded to any of you yet but as soon as I get some time I will. You see,
my e-mail connection is at work and I haven't been there for some time. I
shall not bore you with my problems but I shall return in the very near
future.
