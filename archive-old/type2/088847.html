&gt;
&gt; &gt;As an addendum to the previous post (Re: I Smell Gas Fumes on Mountain
&gt; &gt;Passes), I have noticed a similar occurrence while roadtripping in my
&gt; &gt;girlfriend's 77 FI bus.  Whenever we climb a hill or mountain (or any
&gt; &gt;significant incline, for that matter) there are no noticeable fumes
present,
&gt; &gt;but when coming back down that same grade the gas smell really becomes
very
&gt; &gt;strong.  It always gives me the willies and makes look to make sure that
the
&gt; &gt;fire extinguisher is still mounted back in the cabin.  Can anyone
pinpoint a
&gt; &gt;source of gas fumes that only rears it's ugly head when the nose of the
bus
&gt; &gt;is pointing down a hill?  Thanks!
