Subject: Re: tire covers-MAKE YOUR OWN!

I made my own tire cover using vinyl fabric from So-Fro fabrics and a 3&quot;
or so wide vw logo off the hood of a bug (get them for $1 at swap
meets).  I'm sure someone on the list has taken a pic of it at some
meet.  Trace the tire shape onto the fabric backside, adding about a
1/4&quot; all around.  Cut 0.75-1&quot; outside of this line (the more accurate
the better).  Measure the circumference of the tire and add about 3&quot; to
this, and cut a piece this long, and wide enough to cover the tire with
a 1&quot; kerf added plus an extra 2&quot; that will be folded over to form a loop
for a cord tie.  Sew this all around the circle, allowing the final 3&quot;
to overlap itself.  Sew the loop for the cord, which will be fed thru
the loop plus an extra 16&quot; total to tie a bow.  The overlap with the
string bow tie will be at the bottom of the cover.  Find the center and
place the hood emblem thru holes you melt in with a heated nail.  I used
&quot;push nuts&quot; from a hardware store to hold it on.  Still looks great
after 4 years.
