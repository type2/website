&gt;As far as the Kool Patch versus Q-pads debate, as far as I'm concerned,
&gt;there is no reason to debate. It is like debating whether to use Casterol
&gt;20w50 or Wesson Corn Oil in your crankcase (everyone knows to use Crisco).

&gt;They are to vastly different products, used for to vastly different
&gt;reasons.

But according to his web page:

&gt;What you see in the photo below is a self-adhesive, 3-millimeter-thick
&gt;tile made of asphalt/rubber emulsion, sold under the name Q-Pads

&gt;[Kool Patch] is designed primarily for patching home roofs. It is an
&gt;asphalt/rubber/fiberglass emulsion

The vast difference between these seems to be the addition of fiberglass 
to the latter. Not quite as different as Crisco and Castrol.

Now, I don't want to be churlish about this. Bulley's site is a great 
thing and the last thing I would want is to tempt him to take it down 
because of quibbles. And I do admit that 'twas I who introduced the issue 
of priorities into the mix by talking about brakes vs. soundproofing. So 
I take that back. G. Matthew is right, and I stand admonished.

But asphalt and rubber are abundant, abundant, abundant materials. The 
cost vs. value equation is too simple to describe the pricing decisions 
effecting Q-pads.

The matter of cost vs. value is nicely addressed in _Zen and the Art of 
Motorc#cle Maintenance_. There is no need to purchase a consumer product, 
such as a shim, when a piece of aluminum cut from a beer can will do 
the same job. The only question is whether it will do the same job. 

I wouldn't dream of putting a Yakima or Thule rack on my camper or any of 
my vehicles. When I need to carry something bulky, I clamp on my E-Z rack 
and modify the 2X2 crosspiece made of Douglas Fir to suit.

I am very, very skeptical of consumer products. When one piece of asphalt 
and rubber 12&quot; X 12&quot; X 3 mm costs roughly $5.00 and another piece might cost 
less than a dollar, I want to know the difference between the two. If the 
two are really different, I will gladly fork over the loot.

Somewhere in the distant past, there was a thread on this list about 
Bugpack. Following that thread, I came to the conclusion that I would not 
buy anything with the Bugpack label on it. I was convinced that the 
products were of poor quality, and on this, Bulley is right. Even free is 
too much to spend for a part of poor quality. 

But maintaining and upgrading a bus is a costly proposition, especially 
when the PO spared no expense in trying to destroy the poor thing. This 
list is a tremendous resource, and I hope that it is a place where one 
can ask &quot;what's the difference?&quot;

Rant over.
