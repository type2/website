Even tho my eyes still work fine, I don't poke fun because I know my 
time is coming
sooner or later.  My parents have both had reading glasses for as long 
as I can
remember, and my younger brother started needing 'em in highschool .. 
about
the same time he started losing hair, which I *do* poke fun at him 
about. :-P

OTOH, all my non-metric tools are in the &quot;deep storage&quot; toolbox 'cuz I 
rarely need
them, and everything metric is such a mishmash of brands, age and wear 
that I
can ID my various wrenches &amp; sockets with a glance or by feel.  And 
I've been
messing with these things long enough that I usually know what tools I 
need
before I even get to the driveway .. good eyesight isn't a requirement 
if you've
got lots of practice. :-)
