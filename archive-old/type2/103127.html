Subject: Re: [T2] Correct Tires vs Good Tires?

&gt; What is the correct (or original tires) for my 72 Type 2?

If it came with radials, they were 185R14 Reinforced (also called 185R14C)

&gt; Is this also the
&gt; best tire on the market today? or Are there much better tires that will fit
&gt; my stock rims?

Religious argument!

Most folk are sticking with 185R14 in load range C or D.  Some folks are
going to 195/75R14, but in this size you must go to a load range D (not
C!) to get the proper load capacity.  I've also found that the diameter of
the 195s is a bit too small, though the diameter varies from brand to
brand.

The &quot;Tire Guy&quot; will either try to sell you 185R14 passenger tires or
195/75R14, saying that &quot;They're the same thing!&quot;  They aren't but those
are the tires he commonly has in stock and he doesn't want to go to the
trouble of ordering them.  My advice is to find someone who will do the
right thing and order the proper 185R14 in load range C or D.

Firestone dealers carry Bridgestone RD603s.  Often they have them in stock
as they fit 1-ton Toyota pickups.  The price can go all over the place,
though.  Watch for sales and you can get a great deal.  If you're in a
hurry, you pay more.

Under no circumstanced be tempted by passenger-rated &quot;P-metric&quot; tires.
Your bus will handle like a boat.
