Subject: Re: [T2] Early bumpers on 71

Hi, It's Mick,
At Vanfest this year RAMTAM  Fibreglass Technique had Fibreglass Bumpers,
Overriders and Towelrails for splits, early bays and late bays !
Might not be your cup of tea but I was impressed. So clean and smooth.
Looked long and hard at the Overriders and Towelrails but restricted funds
won the day, for now.
The full towelrails on the front would obscure my number plate.
Only an address if you are interest, I have no connection with these guys.
