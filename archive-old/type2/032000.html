Subject: Heip!! New engine won't start (longish)

Hi all:

I can't get my newly rebuilt engine started and I need some help (and 
comfort.)

I posted the other day that my self-rebuilt 2.0L Vanagon engine fired 
right up on the first pull, and I had just run it through its 20 minute 
break in.  After some lunch I went out to check timing, idle rpms and 
mixture.  Again the car started right up, though it was having trouble 
idling and would easily die.  I tweaked the idle screw and checked that 
the timing was near enough for government work, and then tried to drive 
out of my driveway; the engine wouldnt pull me out of the driveway!!!

The engine was acting like it had a big air leak, and since I was hearing 
a sucking sound I started searching for the problem.  Over the course of 
the day I started the engine up perhaps a dozen times, and it always 
started on the first turn of the key, still idling erratically and with 
no power.  When I couldn't find any leak I began to worry that I had done 
something fundamentally wrong with the engine and so I did a quick 
compression test after running it a couple of minutes from cold; all 
cylinders were over 100 lbs.

Finally I determined that a seam in the front of the air distribution box 
(I'd taken it from a junkyard engine) was leaking air.  Relieved, I 
swapped over to the known-good air distribution box and throttle body off 
my old engine (a real PITA with the engine in the car and all the tin in 
place) and went to start up the engine, confident that I'd found my 
problem.  Again, the engine started up on the first turn of the key, but 
didn't seem to be running any better and still wouldnt pull me out of the 
driveway.

Shutting down the engine, I went to see if I'd done anything wrong in my 
swap and found that, while I'd re-attached the fuel injectors on the left 
side of the engine, I hadnt tightened them down.  Grabbing the 10mm 
wrench I tightened them down and went to start up the engine again.  But 
the engine wouldnt start then (late yesterday afternoon) and has refused 
to start from then on, despite repeated attempts.

What I've checked so far:

     Put a fuel pressure gauge on the rail and I'm getting good pressure.

     Pulled the injector plug on #4 and tested with a test light - 
     regular flicker from lamp.

     Pulled plug wire from #4 and saw good spark to ground.

     Pulled plugs from #2 and #4, noted plugs were wet from gas.

     Grounded plug from #4 and saw good spark across gap.

     Did cold compression test on #4, got 100 lbs.

     Yes, the plug wires are properly distributed.

     Did rough static test of timing and it still seems to be OK.

So, I've got gas, I've got compression, I've got spark; why won't it start?  
What am I missing here?

Specific questions:

Can anybody tell me if my internal gear/cam timing was just *slightly* 
off (I checked it a dozen times but I'm grasping at straws) could I still 
be getting the good compression figures I got?

I'm assuming I went from a too-lean mixture with the leaky air 
distribution box to one thats right, or even too rich.  Does that fact 
suggest anything to anybody?  If my spark timing was maybe not as close 
as I thought, might the engine run lean but not rich?

TIA.
