My experience took months to unfold the first time. (I had two go bad at different times) At 
first it occured once or twice a week for a short period of time. After a few months it was 
doing this approximately 25% of the time. When I pulled it apart I figured it probably could 
have continued for some time before a failure might have occured. (maybee another 6 months or 
more) I didn't experience an actual failure so I can't comment on this. My suspicion is that if 
the joint is making the noise it needs to be replaced. I believe the ball bearings and the 
races they travel in have worn troughs and the rapping occurs when the ball bearings rotate 
into a specific orientation with respect to the races. I suspect the noise results when the 
bearings bind and then release. Sort of like when the planets are in a bad alignment. Its not a 
good thing!

This is my rationale as to why the problem comes and goes. Everything has to be just so for it 
to happen. anyway... this is my theory. 

good luck

I'm getting a lot of votes for cv problems. How does this disease progress?
Progressively louder joints or sudden failure?  Given the possible early
symptoms, do you swap ends and grease, or replace them? How much time do I
have Doc?
