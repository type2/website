Subject: Piston Cylinder question

Help:

I'm getting ready to install a fresh set of AVP heads in my 79 this
weekend.  Originally I had not planned to mess with the pistons/rings and
cylinders at all since compression in OK and I burn no oil.  When I
received the heads I noticed that I will have to remove the cylinder
barrels in order to install the metal shim-gaskets provided with the heads
to maintain proper compression.  My question is whether I need to do
anything to the cylinders..i.e. hone to break glaze etc... before I
reassemble.  I'd rather not mess with all of that since I might as well
install new rings if I'm gonna do all that.

Please reply as soon as possible to my home email address (timatt_at_fwi_dot_com)
since I plan on doing this tomorrow.

Thanx in advance:
