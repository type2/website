Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for Left Heat Exchanger

As far as I understand it, the muffler's the same on the air-cooled
California and Federal Vanagons.  Are you talking about the crossover pipe?

Subject: [T2] Looking for Left Heat Exchanger


&gt; Looking for a left exhaust heat exchanger that fits an
&gt; 80-83 Vanagon Air cooled federal model.  I currently
&gt; have a California Model and I am trying to change the
&gt; muffler over to Federal (which I have already found)
&gt; but need the left heat exchanger since the Cali models
&gt; didn't have one.  Thanks
