Subject: Re: [T2] REDLINE OIL

&gt;&gt; I am going to put a new engine in my 1977 with 2.0liter with hydrualic
&gt;&gt; valves, and i was wondering if anybody has used redline oils in there cars,
&gt;&gt; if so what the oil worth the $8 a quart cost.  i was also wondering if
&gt;&gt; anybody has used redline gear oil in there tranny, thanks.

IMO it's not worth the cost, not to mention that it is not widely available.  I'd just use a good synthetic oil like Mobil One, which can be bought at any Wal Mart or Target.
