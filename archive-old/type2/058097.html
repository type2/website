  I am very confused by all the &quot;names&quot; of all the different bus's. I'm not
even really sure what I have. I guess it is for sure a hardtop and it is for
sure a 1970. It has the camper type bed and places for the sink/fridge to be
installed. It has the closet on the passenger side in the back, and an over
head shelf. It even has the ac hook up  
on the outside drivers side. But I think if I was going to get a personalized
tag it would probably have to say RLYPOLY. That's what my kids say the shadow
of it  looks like when it is going down the highway. O.K. That's my Friday
spin.
