Subject: VW/Type2 Historical data for web-page???
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hey everybody,

I'm just putting the finishing touches on my VW bus web-page (mostly
about my '69 Westy, camping, etc.) and wanted to add some historical
data and/or links to such.

Any ideas?

Also, I'd like to link to anyone else's bus-related site if they are
interested. 


Lemme know.

Jaime
'69 Westy
