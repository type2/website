&gt; There seems to be a lot of play in the steering.  Is this normal?  What
&gt; might need to be looked at?

The whole front end.  Sorry :-(  possible sources are bad tire rods or
drag link, worn idler arm bushings, worn ball joints, misadjusted wheel
bearings.  Usually at 100,000 miles, the front end is just getting a bit
&quot;tired&quot;.  

What I would do:
 1) inspect the ball joints -- this is, alas, a job that you cannot do at
    home :-(  Torn boots are a bad sign.
 2) jack up the front end fo the bus, put it on jack stands and have
    someone lay under the bus while a second person turns the wheel.  Look
    for: vertical movement in the idler arm
         play in the steering box (wheel moves, pitman arm does not)
         play in the tie rods/drag link.
 3) check the wheel bearings.  While they are off the ground shake the
    wheels.  if there is any play, that's bad.

&gt; Does the accessory battery charge while driving or does it need to be
&gt; plugged into a/c to recharge?

should recharge while you are driving (assuming your factory wiring is
working correctly :-)
 
&gt; What is the small silver receptacle under the glove box?

Search the archive at www.type2_dot_com for &quot;silver socket&quot;  this will give
you a lifetime of entertaining reading :-)  It is an accesory socket for
european 12V stuff.  You can buy a plug that fits it at BMW motorcycle
dealers and use it to power a dash fan, or electric socks :-)

&gt; Is there a cigarette lighter receptacle?  Where?

Cigarette lighters are rare from the factory.  if you look behind the
dash, you will see punchouts in the metal that you can use to install an
aftermarket lighter (or a junkyard lighter if you can find one)

BTW, at least one of the &quot;silver socket&quot; posts mentioned a cigarette
lighter that worked in the silver socket.  never seen one, tho.
