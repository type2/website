Having gotten greasy on CV's a time or two, let me weigh in on this
thread...

The half-shaft *must* be free to slide toward and away from the tranny.
As the spring plate moves up and down in the normal course of events the
distance between the tranny and the outer axle stub gets shorter and
longer, and side to side motion is necessary to account for this.

The half shaft *must not* move toward or away from the ground or toward or
away from the front of the bus.  It should  also not be able to be rotated
with the parking brake on.  If you can move it in any of these directions
that means there is play between the inner race, outer race and the ball
bearings.

After you remove the half shaft, you should not be able to rock the plate
that the CV bolts to on the tranny (which, as I remember it was the
original question here).  While this is not a situation I have ever had
to deal with (there are some things man was not meant to know, and
trannies are right up at the top of *my* list! :-), I woul theorize, after
looking in Bentley that the circlip that holds the plate onto the
differential output shaft has popped off, and has been off for enough time
that the splines are very worn.  I think this qualifies as a genuine &quot;bad
thing&quot;.

After you remove the half shaft, the damned rear axle stub *does* tend to
rock a bit.  It *shouldn't* and I think in the long term, this will turn
out to be &quot;bad thing&quot; for me, but mine do tend to have a bit more play
in the rear axle bearings than I think healthy :-(

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
