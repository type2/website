Is there some kind of trick to getting the GD valve cover back on a T4 head
and getting is seated right? I did a valve adjustment for the first time on
my 2.0 this afternoon, and even though I used new gaskets and all, I had a
hell of a time getting them (to where I thought was) in the right place with
the bail on.  And after running to the gas station, I see one leaking
already.  F.  ????  Does anybody make a bolt on for a T4?

I changed the starter (about time) yesterday, and while trying to get at
that annoying bolt behind the throttle body on my T4, I removed a
filter-looking item from overhead in the engine compartment.  All that was
still connected to it was a tiny hose that seem to come down from the outer
wall on the pass. side.  Is this thing really important?

Also, sometime this weekend my bus started something odd:  After the
&quot;startup&quot; high-rev phase ends on my FI, and before it has really be run
around, the westy seems to rev and sputter in a cycle.  You know, vroom
sputter sputter vroom sputter sputter, etc. It goes away by the end of my
street.  What the hell could that be?  I tried by opening the idle screw a
little but to no help.

Any ideas?

Wade
