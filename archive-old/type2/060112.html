Hi all,

Whats been said already is sound common sense, ie hide valuables park, in a
lit place, park next to something more 'pinchable'

VW had things fitted / availlable for the T2 to help keep it secure so -
always engage the steering lock, close the windows, and lock the doors
whenever your leave the vehicle unattended - even if just going to pay for
fuel. Get a locking engine lid catches get one and use it (RMMW sale them) Get
and use a locking petrol cap to prevent fuel theft / malicious contamination
(sugar, water, urine....)

Over here in UK window Type 2s are quite common - probably there are 30 bay
window busses within 1 mile of my house right now, so people do not
particularly notice them. Several friends have had their campers stolen, just
after total restos, or the night before they were going on holiday loaded up
with their kit. One person even had his camper stolen by some house breakers
who then toured the area intending to use the bus to take away their ill
gotten gains.
Vans/campers/busses get stolen simply for spares too.

If you have a driveway and two cars always park the camper furthest from the
road when its loaded with camping gear. Then the thief will have to move your
other car too.

If you dont use your van for long periods use a wheel clamp - one of those
things the police can put on your tyre if you are parked illegaly.

If you have replaced the fuel pump with an elecronic one - controll the power
to it by a hidden switch. Car thiefs abandon vehicles that run out of petrol
50 yards down the road.

Then make the car thief look at another vehicle - your local flaps will sale
imobilisers, dummy alarms, and real alarms.
So buy and use a steering wheel imobiliser and USE IT.
Buy some stickers that say you have an alarm fitted and put them in the
windows.

Consider fitting some dead locks to ALL the doors.

My FLAPS sale flashing LEDS just wire them up so they come on whenever the
ignition is off. They sale dummy ultrasonic sensors with flashing lights just
powered by an internal 9v battery.

Get your chassis number or registration number engraved onto the windows.

Fit a real alarm - must have a flashing LED to advertise itself. Don't
advertise what the alarm is, use some generic window stickers from your FLAPs.
If its a voltage sensing alarm then connect up the courtesy light so it comes
on when the sliding door, tailgate, or engine lid are opened as well as the
cab doors. If the alerm does not have an imobiliser but in fit an electronic
imobiliser too.
BUT DONT get a alarm that comes on a fixed length of time after the ignition
goes off because you want to live in the camper with out the alarm sounding
all the time.
Gat an alarm with a &quot;panic&quot; facility built in to the remote so that you can
attract attention if you are mugged near your bus.
Occasional 'forget' to deactivate the alarm before you open the door both to
advertise that you have an alarm and to check it works.

Ask your insurers if you can get a discount for fitting an approved alarm and
use one of those.

Off course if all else fails then your vehicle is stolen, you can increase the
chance of getting it back if you fit a radio homing beacon. In UK they are
called TRACKER and are actived over the mobile phone network after the theft
is reported. They then transmit a signal for 3 days which is detected by
suitably equiped police cars giving a good chance of the vehicle being
recovered.

Add something to your vehicle which will enable you to idenify it after the
engine number, chassis number and paint have been changed - eg your name and
address painted/engraved on a metal plate hidden inside the heater tube/behind
headlining/ under carpet....... Use your imagination.

Take photographs of your vehicle for identification purposes.  Keep them up to
date, for use in case of a dispute over the value/condition with your
insurers.

The first rule of vehicle security is to make the thief look for an easier
vehicle to steal. The second rule is to fit and always use the extra security
which you have fitted to the vehicle. 
The third rule is don't tell others what security you have fitted - leave them
wondering if the stickers and flashing lights are real or dummy.

Good luck
Bob

PS
I seem to remeber there was a Bob Hoover Sermon on vehicle security which
involved automatic detonation of a CS canister inside the vehicle if you
didn't flick a hidden switch - but thats a bit extreme!
