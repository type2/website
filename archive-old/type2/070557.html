&lt;&lt;Egads! the $35 sending unit I just bought to hook up my light and my oil 
pressure gauge doesn't fit on the '77 engine I have. Well, the threads will 
fit, but the unit itself is too big without extending it out quite a bit with 
a small piece of pipe, which I recall is not a good idea.

I tried the archives, but they're down. If anyone has a solution or 
suggestion, please share. I would really like an oil pressure gauge, but I 
would like to do it right, if possible.

Thanks! Joe&gt;&gt;

Joe,

You need the remote locator kit which I only found at Bus Boys.  It comes 
with a bracket and I mounted the sender on my fire wall.

If you use a offset box end wrench, you can put the wrench over the hose and 
using a slight angle you can tighten the lower end where it threads into the 
engine case.

I used sealant on all the threads.

Or you can cut your tin larger to allow the sender to fit.
