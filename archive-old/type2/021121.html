Well,,, what i want to know ... How can you &quot;prove&quot; a vacuum leak.. 

 install a temp vacuum gauge??

So, with good compression you'd  get a high vac reading at idle, like 20.

what would the reading be with a leak,,, I guess it would depend on the size of
the leak??

I know there are other ways of putting a combustible product near suspect places
of a leak, to see if the engine revs up..   but I wanted to know if you can
prove a vac leak with a vac gauge?
