&gt;&gt; It's illegal to transport refilled disposable bottles...
&gt;
&gt;In some states, they're mighty strong on not transporting refilled bottles
&gt;through road tunnels, too.

Two points.
First of all, it's difficult/impossible to tell that a bottle has been refilled.  Just refrain from refilling the bottles while you're driving next to police cars` 'kay?  :)

Second, the authorities have better things to do than bust you for refilling a $3 propane bottle, unless you're flaunting it (see above).

With propane costing $5 for two bottles at Wally World though, you would have to use an awfully lot of it to make refilling the bottles worthwhile.  I have the adapter needed to refill the small bottles - my dad brazed it together ~40 years ago - but I almost never use it.
