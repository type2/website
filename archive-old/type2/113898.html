Subject: Re: [T2] External Oil Cooler Kits Whose to Use?

&gt;It's not as hot in the south as it is in the west, where I and many busdrivers live in the central valley in california where it is regularly above 100 degrees thru the summer.

Au Contraire, it is just as hot in the South.  Here in Dallas the entire summer is generally in the upper 90's to low 100's.  There may be a few less days over 100 degrees compared to, say Fresno, but when you're that close it doesn't really matter.  It's friggen hot.  

&gt;More holes thru sheet metal, external hoses, AND oil leaks?
&gt;Where do I sign up?

I agree with you there.  No external cooler for me, just a blueprinted oil pump (well, the next engine will have it), synthetic oil and reasonable driving habits.
