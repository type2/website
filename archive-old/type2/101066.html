Subject: Score!!! sliding window parts

Yessssssss!

Folks, the sliding window &quot;guide piece&quot; and window stop
that I got for my 78 from the dealer yesterday is a solid
winner!!!  

My heart dropped when I saw it at the dealership cause it looked
nothing like the piece I had taken out...it was rolled up like a
piece of tape and was very pliable.  After I looked it over closely 
though, it had the same serrations for the corner and fit in the frame 
lips perfectly!

The two parts that I am talking about here are the rubber moulding
around the front and top of the slider part of the window and the &quot;stop&quot;
at the top rear corner.

These are part 18 and part 4a on this microfiche

Part 19aa is NLA, but I am thinking of making my own and wondering if
there were any demand for what I call the actual slider on each end....
keeps the aluminum parts from rubbing on each other and makes the glass
fit further up into the new rubber guide piece(better wind/water seal).

These available parts are

281-847-721  Guide Pce		$24.30
221-845-349  Windowstop		$ 1.50

VW dealer prices....I tripled checked the numbers above with my invoice.

Don't order by vehicle year as these were ordered to fit an 81 
vanagon....yes, you need to cut some off of the guide piece and can cut 
some of the bumpstop if you want, but they fit!!!

Cheers ,dave
