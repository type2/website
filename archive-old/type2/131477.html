&gt;Silicon = Computer Chips

These you need to talk to the List about your Type IIs.

&gt;Silicone = Bewbies

These are a matter of prefference. They are refurbished. But as in any resto 
the outcome is dependent on what you put into them. Some people are strictly 
purists and don't believe in changing what was originally there, some 
believe in slight modification to enhance their equipment. Then there are 
those who believe bigger is better and really get obnoxious like Monster 
Trucks!
Giant Big Round Things that don't match the chasis ;).

Later and have fun it's FRIDAY!,
