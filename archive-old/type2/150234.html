&gt; Cylinder Spacers - I guess these go at the base of the cylinders.

&gt; Bus Depot lists these Cylinder Spacers:::
&gt;
&gt; 17-2000Cc, .040'', 4Pcs    $6.98    80540
&gt;
&gt; Does one-size-fits-all ???  So a 2000cc cylinder will fit into a  
&gt; 1700cc case,

Correct.

&gt; or is there something I am not catching??  Is the .040&quot; spacer the  
&gt; right one to get to replace the cylinder head gasket and the old  
&gt; cylinder spacer??

The gasket is much thinner than the spacer so it's not a direct  
replacement. You still have to compute the compression ratio.

&gt; Also, I am looking for part number for the two paper gaskets (four  
&gt; needed) that fit on each side of the aerobic block gasket that fits  
&gt; between the intake manifold(s)  and the head(s).  Anyone sell  
&gt; these??  Or suggest appropriate gasket-in-a-tube substitutes.

There's no part number that I'm aware of. I think the paper probably  
either came with the originals or the peeled off from age. Hylomar  
would be a good non curing sealant to use.

&gt; Also, are all Deves rings for the 2000 type IV engine pistons the  
&gt; same??  I mean, are there different qualities, like some made in  
&gt; India and others made in Brazil or Germany, and are the oil rings  
&gt; the same in all Deves ring sets for the 2000 type IV engine pistons??

The compression ring is Swedish and the oil control rings are made by  
Deves here in USA.

Check set# 1945 B at the bottom of the page to see what kind of rings  
come in the set:
