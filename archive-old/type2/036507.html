Subject: re:list sticker

All,

Sorry for the waste of bandwidth, but I was p-mailing
with a fellow listee by the name of Dan (I think;-)
about creating some TypeII list stickers, but I
accidentaly deleted his adress from my files. DOH!

So, Dan, are you out there? P-mail me...I have some
stuff to show you!

Jaime
