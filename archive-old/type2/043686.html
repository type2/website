&gt;Listees,
&gt;With all the hot weather I decided to check and make sure my air flaps were opening correctly. Got under the '71 and took off the shroud, right side bottom and voila!, no thermostat. Should I be able to see flaps from there? How does the connection work? I've seen the '79 system with the cable etc but this is a mystery to me.
&gt;
&gt;I've read the recent emails about flaps etc. but still have questions.

Joel,
I don't think you can see the flaps from below.  What you might try is
reaching around to the front of you fan shroud and feeling for the rod
that connects the flaps to one another.  If it's there you have flaps.
If the rod is there but the flaps don't move they are probably wired
open.  if it were me, I'd get a thermostat and rod(assuming you have the
bracket and return spring) and make your cooling system whole again.

Check the archives.  There are several great posts on the geniusness of 
the VW cooling system and how all the parts work in unison.  I even 
transfered the small square tin pieces that attach to the middle of the 
head by tabs between the fins.  the thermostat rod passes right through
one on the passenger side.
