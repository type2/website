Wow!  First a visit from God and now Bill Gates visits us Bus Folk. ;-)

The Vanagon list is   vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu    tho' I'm not sure if 
posting FS stuff is kosher (due to agreement with university).  No one 
seems to flame you if you refer to someone else selling something.  If 
you'd like (Michael) I could post it for you.  (No really, I would.)  :-0
