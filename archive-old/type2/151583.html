Subject: timing/dwell

Checked my dwell the other day and it was 58, which is at the
top of the range for used points, according to Bentley. I wish
I had checked my timing, but my light was buried somewhere.
Yesterday I decided to adjust my dwell and happened to find a
new set of points/condensor and decided to put them in. Got my
dwell set to 46 first time. Found my timing light and checked
my timing....16 BTDC!  Went ahead and adjusted idle to 900 and
timing to 7.5 BTDC.  Question: Would changing dwell from 58 to
46 have changed my timing by that much?  If not, wouldn't this
partially explain why my cyl temps and oil temps seemed to be
higher than normal?
