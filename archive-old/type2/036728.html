Subject: Wiring harness problem resolved (five months later)

I was tuning my '76 back in September, had everything finished, was
warming it up to set the idle. Idled great. Loosened the distributor
clamp bolt to set the timing. Couldn't get it to idle.

A wire had frayed or broken or shorted in the harness.

After a week of guessing and rechecking, I nursed it (leadfoot) to the
local German garage. They were stumped. They didn't want to work on it.
Then the owner determined that they would fix it. They determined that
something in the harness had given way. Scared up a replacement harness.

Unfortunately, it was from a '77. But that's a factor for later in the
tale.

They still couldn't get it to idle. They determined it was the brain
that was bad. I was able to scare up a reconditioned brain.
Unfortunately, the shop that swapped brains with me told me there was
nothing wrong with the stock ECU -- the garage was guessing.

Had it towed to a garage in the next county north that I'd had good
experiences with. The tow cost me a fortune ($380!). This garage had the
bus for two months (it had been three months at the first garage). They
couldn't see what was wrong with it, ran all kinds of tests, including
running a tee into the fuel line to check pressure while driving... THEN
they happened to notice a tag that said &quot;77&quot; on the harness.

A light bulb went on (this garage is run by an old China hand, an adept)
-- the San Diego garage had CONNECTED TWO LEADS MEANT FOR A TESTER and
the ECU was interpreting this superfluous circuit as &quot;run wide open&quot;
from time to time, resulting in erratic idling and lack of acceleration.
This explained the dark plug conditions the second garage was seeing.

So I finally picked up the bus (want to fray a marriage, bum a ride from
your spouse for five months) before I did something rash like buying a
minivan.

Now I'm on the prowl for a decel valve, since I'm missing one (thanks
Mark Hineline for pointing that out) since I've gotta pass smog in a
couple of months.

So that's the whole ugly story. A long, long time without the bus and
some serious cash to two garages and one towing company. Still cheaper
than a payment book.

Anyway. THAT was what was wrong with my bus. Bad harness, then a
new/used harness with a couple connections that shouldn't have been
made.
