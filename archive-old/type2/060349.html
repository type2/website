&gt; Regarding Michelin quality ....

&gt; Our experience has been, Michelin tires last several times longer
than any
&gt; other brand under these high load conditions.  Up to 10 times longer
than the
&gt; other major brands.
&gt; 
&gt; Because of the nature of these tests, the tread is not worn. 
However, these
&gt; tires do experience extreme fatigue.  After all, we are trying to
fatigue
&gt; wheels.
&gt; 
&gt; My 20 years experience in the tire/wheel industry has been that
Michelin
&gt; quality is unbeatable.  This quality does come at a price.
&gt; 
&gt; If price is a consideration, look at Yokohama and Dunlop tires.
&gt; 
&gt; If safety outweighs price, go with Michelin.

Well, I've never had a Yokohama or even a cheapo Hercules peel its
tread off.  It's happened two different times with Michelins (luckily
neither time on a bus).  Both time it occured without warning, and the
tread did rather nasty damage to the vehicle's bodywork before I could
get the vehicle stopped.  With other tires my experience is that an
impending tread separation is heralded by an out-of-balance vibration
before the tread lets go.

Admittedly, my experience is too little data to establish a trend, but
it is still enough to keep me away from the Michelin dealer.

It seems to me that Michelins have trouble when they get toward the
end of their life, say three years old or so.  Your data indicates
that your testing involves severely overloading them but not running
them for very long.

So, let's expand our data.  Has anyone had any non-Michelin tires come
apart?  Perhaps the Michelin failures is simply a me-too thing with a
popular brand, much like the Ford Pinto debacle.
