Subject: Re: [T2] Installed my USED thermostat today. :-)

Hey Chris

I am about to install one also.
Are you saying the thermostat should be squeezed together tight such  
as hand strength or by channel locks???  I assume a good tstat is  
already in its fully contracted position at room temp while  
installing.  Should I put the known good used tstat in a freezer   
first ??? (assuming room temp is about 80 F).

&gt; blown thermostat. If it is springy, it is blown. Cold, it must be  
&gt; tight, contracted, and squeezed IN.  It's also possible that your  
&gt; cable might be &quot;too long,&quot; allowing you to attach it with  
&gt; thermostat contracted and flaps open. I *think* (ouch) the standard  
&gt; length cable won't let you do this. I *think* (ouch) that you HAVE  
&gt; to hold the flaps closed in order to attach a standard length cable  
&gt; from a contracted (cold, closed) thermostat. This leads me to  
&gt; believe your thermostat may be perpetually expanded (blown).
