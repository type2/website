Subject: A Pain in the Joints
To: Type2_at_type2_dot_com

Greetings All,

I just got into removing the axles and servicing my CV joints.  The first one 
I pulled was shot, so I took a little trip on down to my FLAPS.  I picked up 
four new CV joints (just in case) and headed back home to do the dirty deed.  
When I got home and opened up one of the boxes (GKN - Glaenzer Spicer) the CV 
joint was as stiff as a board.  No movement at all.  If I forced it with hand 
pressure (about as much as I could exert) only it would eventually give - a 
little.  Upon opening the other boxes I found they were all like that!
So............Is this what they are supposed to be like when new?  My old one 
moves around freely and clicks into place just like Bentley says it's 
supposed to.  I know there is a big difference between new and old in any 
mechanical operation, but Man!  These new joints are like rocks.  Help me on 
this one..........I either need some reassurance or some guidance.

TIA,
Mike
