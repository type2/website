Subject: torque wrench again

Hi List,
	I guess I should have been a bit more specific.  I have both
snap-on and craftsman torque wrenches covering from 20-250+ ft/lbs.  When
I do heads, etc., I like to come up in a series starting at 50% which is
about 10 ft/lb or so for type IV heads.  I also feel one should not run a
torque wrench right at the ends of it's range (either end) and expect the
best accuracy.  So that rules out using the &quot;generic&quot; 20-150 ft/lb device
that most of us started our &quot;underhood career&quot; with.  Do y'all that use
the same &quot;come up in steps&quot; head sequence use the small inch/pound
wrenches i.e. Proto 6062 series?  or is there something else preferred for
this application?  Thanks again jon

Jon Syder
