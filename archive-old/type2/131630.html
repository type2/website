Subject: RE: [T2] Bus fight in court

Okay thread has been killed. It happened before I got back from court. Iw 
ant to thank everybody that responded positively about this. It is very near 
and dear to my heart and was leaning to my demise. I have fought about this 
since March. We had a verbal agreement that if it was out of sight out of 
mind. His wife decided to investigate my yard, tresspassing I might add. 
Which I will be seeing them in court about on the 20th. This bus was 
operable and I dreamed of fix the PO's mistakes. In Feb. I set out to find 
FI system right what was wronged. I am still assembling it today. GEX 
problems, basically all those might aswell take care of this now type of 
things. Long story short. He has sexually harrassed my wife I am not a huge 
guy BUT i COULD EASILY HAVE ENDED HIM THEN. I didn't, love my family too 
much to have them deal with the repercussions while I sat in Jail. Meditate 
work on el Verde.....
My lease is up at the end of the month. July 30th he stops by unannounced 
demanding rent and late fees for the month of July, yes month of July. Late 
fees at the tune of $100. He also states that he is going to have my Bus 
removed from the property. In not so nice words I told him he could remove 
himself. A police officer at the station where he was questioned mentioned 
that my wife said we would be using the deposit as the last months rent. 
That is why he stopped by with his rediculous demand. The man is cooked. No 
time wasted I was served papers on the 2cnd. NC Law states a mandatory Grace 
period from due date 10 days. Besically I laughed with the judge at him and 
his attorney. I was even allowed to refresh the attorney's memory of the 
Landlord Tenant Law Gen Statutes in reguards to Late Fees. Similar to how 
you explain to the mechanic working on your dinosaur how to change the oil.

So the Judge quashed the rent and fee, but had to up hold the inoperable 
vehicle because it was written in the lease and the ammendment was verbal. 
Since there was no public policy for this I had to take it. The judge 
regrettedly had to rule in favor of that old, perverted, smelly, ugly, anal 
retentive, needing my fist in his face, a_at_#hole.

Good news is that the rent we are fighting over is only determined by the 
amout of time I stay there. If I move out early I pay less, up until the 
last few days when the court cost override the dollar value by $110. And I 
am still going to use the deposit as last month's rent...HA!

Bus Content: Thanks again to all that have helped me so far in the bus 
resurection. And thank you all who gave their support on such short notice. 
El Verde will ride again soon the new house I am looking at now has a garage 
that will fit. Owner finance if I want, lease for less than I pay now if I 
don't want to buy. I plan on driving her over there. Engine has to go in 
this weekend. Filler neck should arrive today(thanks Stefan!), gas tank 
tonight.

Even though I was charged with my first Summory Ejectment today by 
technicality, I still get to keep my bus I am still planning on moving by 
the end of the month. I am glad I am not writing to you all about how this 
thing is driving me crasy, come get it, the first $500 takes it. Come on Don 
look at the havic I am dealing with and no I will not let it go.....

Bob said it best,&quot;...these things are like drugs...&quot;.


Thanks everybody and sorry about the major venting,


Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe, &quot;el Verde&quot;
