FUN&lt; FUN&lt; FUN!!!!!!!!

If you wanted to go to Jerome but didn't, start plannning for next year.

Jim T and I had a huge caravan from CA to AZ.

I got a flat while pulling off an offramp.  I had a great spare but NO
JACK!

Jim drove 40 miles for me and bought a floor jack. THANKS

Drove til late, camped amongst LOUD trucks, got up early and headed for
Jerome.

We arrived at Jerome in the early afternoon, SHOCKED to see numerous buses
already there.

Friday night, over 100 buses by midnight!

Saturday morning was nice, buses rolling in, lots of handshaking and
matching of faces with names etc.  

I took my 3 years old boy, this year NO diapers!!!!!!!!  we had a blast
looking at buses.

I ran into a crew cab I sold probably 12 years ago, still looked identical,
brought the new owner up to snuff on the weird things I remembered fixing
etc.

The raffle and auction was fun for all.

Friendly people everywhere.   the bike brigade raced thru camp several
times late at night, old bicycles, no lights, ringing their bells as they
weaved.

OUT-OF-CONTROL    12lb roast bar-b-que with Ronnie, VWHoward and Corey and
friends.


One small short-lived rain shower and lots of warm weather.

One of the BEST PARTS, was the fact that out of 400 vws, there were only
maybe a dozen that were restored.  I enjoyed all the buses and drivers that
were just keeping their buses alive and ON THE ROAD!!!!   Not a fashion
show at all.


Pre-register me for next years show please.

I'm headed to a bus show in Japan real soon, I'll post details from Japan.


Keep them on the road,
