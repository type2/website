Alas, a proper pressure/volume test would answer all questions with regard
to the assumption of a fuel problem. Why not just stop guessing and run the
procedure and know for sure????? You have already wasted time/money on the
ignition components. The gist I got is you just replaced everything, didn't
test the parts to confirm if they had anything at all to do with the
problem. You could have bought a good quality fuel pressure guage for less
than the cost of the ignition parts likely not needed. Just think about
that and re-evaluate how much time/money you have left to waste before you
begin to address the problem with the gathering of facts as opposed to
acting on assumptions.

&gt;&gt; Nope.  It does try to start a little better, but will
&gt;&gt; only run for 20 seconds or so and then shut down. It
&gt;&gt; will not start after that.  If I leave it for about
&gt;&gt; half and hour and then try, it will again fire up, but
&gt;&gt; then shut down after said time period.  AARRGG!
&gt;
&gt;have you checked to see if the AFM is triping the double relay, sounds
&gt;like the fuel pump is running on the start circuit but as soon as it
&gt;starts it switches to the AFM to keep the fuel pump running.  a bad trace
&gt;or the plug is loose etc. could cause just this problem
