Subject: RE: [T2] It was running when I parked it...

I've got a 77 Westie in my driveway, fuel system full (and I mean full) of 
brown tar, ran when parked.

Cant part with because of impending resto story- 1951 Landrover, canvas and 
rubber rotted, parked since 1972.  1988, can't sell going to restore even 
though I wouldn't know a torque wrench if it jumped up and bit me on the , 
well, you know.  Went back in 1997, same Landy, same condition, same story.  
Went back in 05, still in planning stage.  In 06, the rental unit built over 
the garage that housed it burnt to the ground, taking the Landy with it.
