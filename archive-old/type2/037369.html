Subject: 1975 Owners Manual and Advertising Flyer

Volks,

I have scanned and put on the web the 1975 Westfalia/Campmobile owners
manual and an advertising flyer for the same year.  the URL's are:

http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/owners_manual/index.htm
and
http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/advert_site/index.htm

Three things... 

First, Photoshop 5.5 *rocks*!!!  

Second, the owner's manual is fairly yellowed and waterstained.  If any
Photoshop pro's out there have a technique for cleaning these scans up,
please get in touch. 

Third, if you look at the bus pictured on the front of the owners
manual... apparently, they came standard from the factory with the gas
stain down from the filler neck :-)
