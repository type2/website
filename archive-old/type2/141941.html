&gt;  I'm confused as to why they're split in the first place.

This is by no means an official version of what happened, only my 
observations:

1. The list had already split once. Originally it was &quot;lenti&quot; on a 
server named &quot;gerry.&quot; Watercooled Vanagons split off and formed 
vanagons_dot_com. So it seemed like that was the way things would be; as 
lists grew too large, they would split. (Sometimes I've thought a split 
between carbed bays and FI bays might be warranted, but I don't see the 
necessity).

2. Around the time of the split, the dot bomb was really heating up. 
Newbies were getting computers for Christmas, logging on from AOL, 
sending messages in all caps, and making the admins pull their hair 
out. I'm not sure how a split was supposed to help that, but I know it 
was a contributing factor.

3. There was something of a difference between split people and bay 
people. I don't think it was a problem, but it's possible that some of 
the split people did. There were a lot of threads about lowering and 
chopping, and these usually pertained to splits.

4. One Sunday night, the reigning admin came home from a trip, checked 
his mail, and found over 100 messages from type2. &quot;Gawd, this list is 
busy,&quot; he remarked.

There were doubtless other factors, but I think that #1 really was the 
deciding one, and not something that would ever be reversed. But maybe 
the VB/type 2 split should be healed back up.

(Another historical note: Unca Joe used to post a demography of the 
list every Friday: where we all were, and how many.)
