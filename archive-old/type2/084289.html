&gt;  I don't have another one to listen to so, With the hatch to the engine
&gt; compartment open should I hear the air going through the air
&gt; distribution box? Had a severe vacuum leak that I fixed but I still hear
&gt; the hissing sound. Can't seem to pin it down. Plugged all vacuum ports
&gt; to rule out the hoses, still hear it. SHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSH.
