Subject: Finishing details - parts needed for '80 Westy
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.9910190033140.17486-100000_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net&gt;

I am almost at the end of the road collecting all the missing bits for my
'80 Westy.  The only parts I am still missing are the ones I thought
would be easy, but which are turning out not to be.

Does anyone out there have a table arm for the front table of an '80
Westy? They differ from the loaf arms (taller and less throw) or a set of
rear window curtains and the support bars that are not too faded??  They
are dark brown, and seem to fade like crazy :-(
