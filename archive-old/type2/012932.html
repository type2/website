Hello List,

Out of curiosity, I am wondering, how difficult it
would be to get ahold of a &quot;WESTFAKIA&quot; pop-top? How
much would one in good working order with a decent
canvas cost? I own a plain 1973 VW bus and was
pondering at the idea of instaling some kind of pop
top, cloth sun roof, or metal sun roof. If any one has
any thoughts on any of those ideas or the WESTFAKIA
pop top, I would like to hear it.

Thanks!

David Kelly from Wilmington, North Carolina

P.S. Does any one know of a good VW junk yard in the
Eastern part of North Carolina where I might find any
of these things?
