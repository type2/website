Jon,

I have a white 75 Westfalia for sale.  It is in good-fair condition.  If
you know of anyone who might be interested please have them get in touch
with me.

I removed the engine to replace the throw-out bearing and when I
re-installed the engine it refused to run.  It will start but not stay
running.  It drives nicely.  Asking $800.00

Thank you very much,

Randy Halvorsen
