Subject: Re: Pilot bearing... what's left anyway

OK, I got the pilot bearing out by using the goodle method of grinding it 
down one side, then gentley chiselling it out. I have the new one ready to go 
in. The problem I have is, how does the new one go in? I know the &quot;pressing&quot; 
in part, but there is a larger lip one one side than the other. The side with 
the larger lip has the manufacturer's stamp on it. I'm assuming that this 
side goes out (towards the front). Can someone let me know before it gets 
dark? (About 8:30 Eastern)
