&gt; Anyone know the crash test ratings of various buses?
Years back, I frequented a local VW wrecking yard (now
gone) and I tried to learn as much as I could with
each trip there. One thing I studied was how damaged
the vehicles were. Of course, if there was nothing
left, it would not have made it to the yard cuz no
parts would be saleable - however - what I noticed
about the bay buses was that there was always &quot;room to
live&quot;. It seemed that no matter what kind of damage,
the body was caved in about 6-8inches, but seldom any
further. I even saw them where the entire body was
caved in like that! One had a tree fall accross the
drivers door- it caved in the top of the door and the
roof almost a foot deep and the glass was sticking
outward but unbroken. The door was workable. There was
room to live. I have a nice photo of a Vanagen on the
other hand, that has as its most forward point, the
back cushion of the drivers seat. All the nose was
wrapped around to the passenger side, just ripped from
the body, including drivers door. Nothing scientific
about this - just some observations with no data! -BaH
