Subject: West Coast Bus

got lucky, I saw a Westy on the Samba Classified. So I took a train  from  
Bakersfield California to Clear Lake, Just North of San  Francisco. I took 
the  
cash with me not knowing anything about the bus.  1971 Westy in great 
condition.  I bought it on the spot. That night I  slept in it on the San 
Francisco Bay, 
with  a view of the ocean. The  next morning I took the long way home on HWY 
101 along  the coast. I  even went past Bakersfield on the coast and took HWY 
126 and came  down  the grape vine into Bakersfield. Life has been good ever 
since. that  was  two and a half years ago. Daily driver. weekend camper on 
the  
beach..
