&gt; (stuff deleteed)
&gt; 
&gt; The socket on your dash is a 12v outlet.  The corresponding plug is
&gt; availiable at bmw motorcycle dealers, as they use it for electric vests. 
&gt; I have heard that outlet was used for a compressor for a space saver
&gt; spare, although I've never seen either a tire or pump
&gt; 
&gt; danno
&gt; 
&gt; 
i think i've seen the pump.  one of my wife's uncles runs a car 
dealership and recently acquired an almost mint one owner 55000 
original miles beautiful green-yellow with green plaid interior and 
the original radio with 8-track player 1974 camper.  he wanted $4995 
and sold it very quickly.  included was a small spare that fit under 
the sink and a compressor that ran off a cigarette lighter.  it was 
all original.  am i right or crazy?
