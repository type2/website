Subject: Re: fuzzy inside of poptop

&gt;i've been cleaning my new/old westy poptop and washed it down you know.
&gt;there was some mold spots on the underside -on the fuzzy hairs of my
&gt;poptop. what was the fuzz used for - insulation? sound dampening? i was
&gt;hoping to wash out the little mold spots, but couldnt get them out. at
&gt;least the underside is real clean now that i washed it and put it out to
&gt;dry all day in the 90*F plus heat here in so. CA yesterday. has anyone
&gt;done anything to the fuzzy stuff? like repaint it, respray it with some
&gt;other insulation material? i'm guessing now that its nice and clean i
&gt;better just leave it alone :)

I have no idea what the fuzzy stuff is for, except to provide a great
environment for growing mold. After replacing my poptop seals on my '77
Westy recently, I undertook to clean the mold stains off the inside. I just
used a rag and some Lysol spray cleaner and scrubbed until it was gone ---
which was pretty gruelling, since I didn't have the space, time, or
resources to actually remove the top, and we all know how quickly the blood
drains from upraised arms. I then used some generic spray-on-and-vacuum-off
upholstry cleaner to finish the job, which worked pretty well once I
figured out that the can is meant to spray upside down, so I had to spray
the foam onto a brush and then work it onto the ceiling. It looks pretty
spiffy now.

All this came after an initial misapprehension during which I mistook the
fuzz for a really egregious infestation of mold, and to answer your
question, yes, I have attempted to remove it, and you may rest assured that
it will withstand thirty minutes of dedicated scrubbing with a
stiff-bristled brush. My initial admiration for the incredible tenacity of
&quot;mold&quot; was eventually supplanted by a deep sense of creeping stupidity.
(Though not as severe as the time I laboriously stripped the all paint from
the air intake grille in order to remove some &quot;rust&quot;, but that's another
story and one I intend to take to the grave with me.)

If I had to guess, the fuzz is there to keep you from scraping your head if
you sit up suddenly upon waking. To judge from what I had to clean out of
the mattress when I acquired the bus, it probably provides some protection
for one's backside as well.


Cheers,
Eric
