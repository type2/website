and HELP again.

I've sold my bus, I want to unsubscribe.  No..I don't want to unsubscribe,
but if I don't I'll drive myself crazy thinking about the wonderful vehicle
I've sold, and while slowly going insane, I'll begin to plot against my
wife and the cats...whom I honestly believe are looking over my shoulder
now...the cats, not my wife....and perhaps we'll end up snowed in at some
remote mountainside hotel in Gatlinburg, Tennessee....where I'll begin
chasing her through the building wielding a tire iron and a jack handle
&gt;from a Bilstein jack..all the while shouting out in a bad Jack Nicholson
impression &quot;All Honda and No Bus makes Bob go Crazy!!!!

Please, help me unsubscribe
