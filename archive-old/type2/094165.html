Subject: '71-'72 or '73+ what do I have brake saga

I continue to wonder what I have.  Today I rebuilt the calipers.  The tip
given by George Lyle was especially helpful in getting the pistons out.  I
only had to pressurize out one piston. I had ordered a rebuild kit for
'71-'72.  It looked like it would work, so I gave it a try, it did.  The two
different versions have different part numbers, so does this mean that I
have '72 brakes since these fit?

The rebuild kit only includes the piston seals and dust covers and two
washers.  I think that both brake versions have he same diameter pistons,
but I do not know for sure.  The rebuild kit seemed to work just fine.  I
think that the main difference is the in the thickness of the pads.  I could
easily put in thicker pads, but then again, my rotor is really thin.

Repair Kit, Front Brake Caliper, 73-79 Bus, 80-85 Vanagon
$19.75

Repair Kit, Front Brake Caliper, Left or Right, 71-72 Bus
$18.95
211 698 471C

Maybe the only difference between the rebuild kits is in the design of the
dust cover to allow the piston greater travel

I cannot make the '72 (are they really '72) rotors that I ordered work with
these calipers, so back on the crappy old rotors go.  Now all I need is a
good set of rotors.  I ordered a set that is supposed to fit a '72, they do
not work, do I need a '73+ set of rotors?

The calipers that I rebuild looked just fine, much better than the ones that
my mechanic took off.  Those were pitted and I broke off some of the lip
that holds the dust cover when I was rebuilding them.  I have better
calipers now.  They were really nasty though.  One piston was really stuck.
But they are in good shape now.
