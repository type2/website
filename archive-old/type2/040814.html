&gt; Stella and I celebrated our 1 year anniversary together today.

Well, for some the honeymoon will last this long.

My first 'relation' broke down on the first day. That kind a spoils the fun.
Took her home from the guy she had been with previously. The drive home was
lots of fun. Boy was I proud to have her ....

But then, after dinner, I took her out for a little drive around the block
and she suddenly refused to go any further. I could not persuade her to move
an inch on her own. Broken heart .... Needed valve replacement surgery to
mend. Well after this 'little' incident we still stayed together for another
two years and although I now have gotten into 'relations' with several
similar types I never completely trust them anymore (and I'm sorry to say
that my fairings with their human counterparts has not been entirely
successful as well).
