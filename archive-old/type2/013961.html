Subject: Type 2 recruits and Type 2 fliers

Hello List,

Well it is Friday. I had a Friday Question. I have
seen many bay window busses lately in town. A couple
of these busses were for sale, some needed some TLC
and a one or two were restored, beautiful models. I
think that the owners of these busses could really
benifit and/ or contribute to the list. My thought was
to make up a Type 2 flier that tells what the Type 2
Websight and Type 2 list is about. I thought that
whenever I saw one of these parked busses in parking
lots or else where, I could stick one of these fliers
under the busses' windshield wiper. Does this sound
like a good or bad idea. I would like to see some list
bus owners from my own town on the list.

Let me know what you think.
