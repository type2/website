Hi Folks,

This weekend, I changed my oil and attempted to put a drain plug temp sender 
into my Type 4 sump, but it would not fit.  The &quot;drain plug&quot; appears to be a 
plate with a cap nut in the center that threads onto a bolt/stud inside the 
engine.  I'd consider punching the plate, but it has ribs all around it, and 
the flat parts are too small for a standard sender.  FWIW, the engine code 
is GE046847.

So, does anybody know of a Type 4-specific drain plug sender, or is the 
dipstick sender the way to go for these engines?

Also, my Type 4 engine is leaking oil (big surprise).  I've seen leaks from 
the valve cover gaskets, and also suspect that oil is leaking from the 
pushrod tubes.  In addition, oil appears to be running down the sides of the 
oil filter and dripping off the bottom.  Finally, the oil sump is covered 
with oil (on the outside).

Short of pulling the engine and replacing everything I can reach, does 
anybody know of places where oil would leak and drip from the above spots?

Thanks again for your help.
