&gt; I've heard that Vanagon seats sit about an inch higher than the 
&gt; originals. I thought this might make a tall person's head bump or maybe 
&gt; impair visibility. Is this a problem with yours?

is true, takes a week or so to get used to, I'm kinda short so I didn't
notice any head clearance problems (5'8&quot;)

&gt; I've heard the arm rests on the seats will hit of you rotate the 
&gt; passenger's seat to the rear. I've alsop heard that you either have to 
&gt; remove the arm rests on the door or the ones on the vanagon seats. What 
&gt; has been your experience?

I had to take all the Vanagon seat armrests off except one in the center,
if both seats have the center armrests on, getting between the seats is
very hard, with only one it is doable

&gt; I'm told the installation is really easy, but nothing about the bus is 
&gt; really easy. Any installation tips to share?

VW comparatively easy
