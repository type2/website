I have already pmailed the original poster on this request. The part he
wanted comes on a 914. It is the vent box with a oil filler mounted to the
top. It uses a screw-on cap, same as on a 72 to 79 bus type4 engine.

On another 914 question: does anyone know if the flywheel is the same as on
a bus engine?

&gt;Looking to purchase the oil filler top, that bolts to the oil breather top
on
&gt; Type 4 engines.  Would really like the whole breather can, but if you just
&gt; have the plastic filler top, that would be great too.  I am putting a 411
&gt; engine into my '73 Sunroof and have access thru the engine hatch panel,
but
&gt; the breather top that is currently on there has to be completely removed
to
&gt; pour oil into the engine.... me thinks that I would soon be needing to
stock
&gt; up on breather box cork gaskets.... so, the request.
&gt;
&gt; I know they exist... was just at a junkyard and saw one on a '73 hardtop
&gt; Westy..... CB engine, with engine hatch, so seems a little unusual....
Would
&gt; have gladly bought it from the owner of the junkyard, but it comes with
the
&gt; complete bus....$800.... and me thinks that is just a bit too much to pay
for
&gt; a oil filler top/breather box.....
