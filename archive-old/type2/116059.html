Subject: Re: [T2] dial indicator - end play

on 10/21/03 02:52, Phil Trenholme related:

&gt; I'm quite happy with the &quot;made in China&quot; dial indicator and magnetic base I
&gt; got from Harbor Freight. It has a large face and considerable travel. Very
&gt; inexpensive. Also have an old Starrett with much smaller face and less
&gt; travel but a better clamp which is handy on non-magnetic aluminum motors.
&gt; 0.001 precision is fine for end play.

i'd echo what phil says mostly. the magnetic base kit is the way to go. you
get the dial indicator and the base and arm. this works perfectly for
endplay measurements, and the bonus is it will work for lots of other things
as well.

i would suggest mitutoyo or starette. the mitutoyo are not all that
expensive, definitely more than chinese made, but you get what you pay for.
the mitutoyo kit i have has a really nice storage case as well, which may
seem unnecessary, but it is always good to store precision measuring tools
in a safe place.
