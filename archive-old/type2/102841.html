Subject: Re: [T2] 78 T2 Air Intake Boot

&gt;  The air intake boot on my 78 T2 has several cracks. I think that this is 
&gt; leading to some of my problems. Cant find any new ones for sale. Some of the 
&gt; other ones look close, will they work or should I try to seal up the one I 
&gt; have. Any thoughts. Thanks, Pete.
 
As far I know, only the 75 - 79 [and 74 Cal w/auto trans] bus hose will work. Part # 022-129-967AC
I just did a vender search.....you were right.....NLA.
I guess I have to start picking them up in the yards.....
I don't have any good used ones now, sorry.
