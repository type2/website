Subject: pop-top removal

How easy it to (re-) install a pop-top? I searched the archives to no
avail-

My Vangon Westy pop-top needs re-furbishing and I was thinking of
removing it from the van (since I'm going to replace the canvas anyway)
for several reasons - can clean the inside top without mucking up my
van's interior, easier to sand on saw horses outside and the big reason,
can move it down my cellar so I can prep and paint at night with the
comfort of the wood stove getting a jump on spring. But if the top is a
big job to align when re-installing, then I rather skip it and get the
step ladder (s) out
 
Any help with this one?
