&gt;Yes it is &quot;possible&quot;, no it is not a good idea. The 1600 Bug engine is not
a
&gt;Bolt-in swap exactly, you would have to cut or change your input shaft on

&gt;the trans to get it to bolt on.

Hmmm,

I just put a beetle engine (D1  code) into a 73 Westy
without any mods to the input shaft.  Maybe I was lucky ?

This is a temporary measure while I take care of the rod
knock problem the type 4 I pulled out has. I definitely prefer
the torque the type 4 has. You can maintain 65 up hill on the
interstate with the type 4, ...and you can't do that with the beetle
engine I installed.
