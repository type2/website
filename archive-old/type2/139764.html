&gt; Just wondering... Has anyone ever seen an engine conversion applied to an

probably not and since the connection to the crank is the same it may be
same components.

&gt; Would there be issues with a higher output engine pushing the auto trans? Or
&gt; would the torque converter take care of it?

torque converter would probably be fine, but since the actual gearbox used
in the bus is the same as the early rabbit/scirocco/dasher/ &amp;  Audi
fox/100LS/5000.  so the question of handling the extra would probably not
be a big deal.   but I wonder since the tranny seems to be the weak point
in a bus (auto tranny) it seems it would be putting a lot of extra stress
on the weak link.  doubt I would try it but it is your tranny.
