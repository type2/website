&gt; Rear Hatch Mosquito Screens for '72-79 Westfalias are available again!  They
&gt; allow you to keep your rear hatch open when camping, and snap into place
&gt; using the stock snap recepticles on your Westy.  They are original-look
&gt; repros. These screens were unavailable for quite some time.

So I wrote:

I still have my original and I used it bigtime in Baja last summer on the hottest, buggiest trip of my life. These are very functional things and anyone who caps in buggy places would want one.

BTW, you can leave it snapped on on the driver's side, unsnap the rest, roll it up and store it vertically in the space right behind the cubbyholes in the closet cabinet. Then it's ready to roll
out, snap down, and use when you get where you're going.

Good job, Ron.

Drive safely,
