ok, this is my first post and please forgive if I am not following protocol.
I live in So. Cailf and just purchased a 1975 bus that needs a motor rebuild.
Alot of companies here to choose from but I would like to hear everyones
thoughts on who performs a good job and who to stay away from.  I have spoke
with GEX, AVP, Strictly Foreign, Fast Germon Auto and Mark Stephens.  Please
advise!
