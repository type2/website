Subject: RE: [T2] aftermarket, intermittent wipers

&gt;My take on this is that you have to provide some means (i.e., a electrically
&gt;separate/isolated switch contact) to turn on the delay - based on the
&gt;description of the stalk mounted switch having a separate delay position.
&gt;Not having either a Golf or Vanagon wiring diagram to reference, I can't
&gt;tell if it's OK if this contact closes simultaneously with the non-delay
&gt;slow speed contact, or not.  The wiper switch in my bus has 3 positions,
&gt;OFF, SLOW and FAST.  With that as a given, I can imagine that, if it is OK
&gt;to have the slow speed contact closed when the delay is operating, then, I
&gt;could add a separate pushbutton to signal the delay to turn on and then to
&gt;&quot;program' it for delay time.  But I'd rather not experiment without more
&gt;information on this.


My bus is a '78 Westy and it does have the fixed delay wipers - that is 
delay - off - low speed - high speed.

I think I could in my case substitute the programmable delay relay for the 
fixed delay relay on my bus after double checking the wiring schematics in 
my Bentley. As for the early baywindows I think it would still be easy to 
wire this up with an external switch.

This external switch would be wired to the relay and then to the low speed 
side of the wiper motor. The switch applies 12 volts to the delay relay 
just like the delay position on my '78's delay position.

I believe this is how most of the JC Whitney sourced aftermarket kits work.
