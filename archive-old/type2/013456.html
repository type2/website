Hi Volks!

&gt; I wonder how long Type IV parts like pistons and

That's for the Type 4 volks out there to answer.  Me, I'm
a straight Type 1 guy.  Wouldn't touch a pancake with
a stick.  ('Twould have to be an Automatic for me to touch
it, in other words. ;-)

&gt; Also, do the water
&gt; cooled vans have air conditioning, and are these buses
&gt; bays or bricks (Vanagons)?

They build Bays in Brasilia (air cooled for Brasilia,
water cooled for Mexico) and Vanagons in South America
(water cooled inline engines only).  The Bays probably
don't have air condition, I think they're rather low-tech
anyway; the Vanagons might well have air condition,
but I don't know for certain.

&gt; It's hard to follow Maude's advice when it comes to
&gt; vans...&quot;here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get too
&gt; attached&quot; referring to the VW bug she just swiped.

However, I think that they need not be kept forever by
the same owner.  Me, I love buying them.  I'll have to
sell some soon if I want to keep buying them.  ;-)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
