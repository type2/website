Subject: RE: [T2] vacuum port on carb

CB Performance says that this carb does not have the vacuum advance port and
needs to have a 009 or 050 distributor. Their website just says that it works
with the 009, but I emailed them and they said that it does not have the
port.

Corbett

&quot;I was under the impression that the ports were already there for a sigle
port vacum advance distributor, as shown in the pics (plugged with rubber
stoppers in the pic). I plan to buy a set of these myself, and I have the
009 dizzy, so vacum isn't an issue immediatley, but I would like to know I
can switch to vacum if I want to.&quot;
