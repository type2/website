Subject: spark plug wire #4

When I pull the spark plug wire off of #4 it doesn't seem to affect the
engine. No noticeable drop in engine noise. (ie. it doesn't seem to run
any differently) If I pull off any of the other ones you can hear the
engine run ruffer.  What does this mean? I'm sort of new at this so no
laughing.

Thanks,
Sharon
