&gt;The small port / vaccum on this one, is it for the &quot;advance&quot;? (I guess yes!)

You guessed correctly.

&gt;Also, can i use my &quot;stock&quot; distributor? (i don't see why not!)

Yes.  Leave the vacuum retard unhooked and time to 7,5 BTDC - that should get you in the ballpark.

&gt;I have many jets (idle) to play with and am ready to do so, any other suggestions would be appreciated.

No other suggestions - I think you are equipped to handle it.  :)
