Subject: WTB: Westy 110v to 12 v converter
Message-ID: &lt;NGFBAGFEOHNCAAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

All this talk of the 110 to 12v converter has got me thinking...I've got the fridge, but I don't have the converter. If someone out there has an old westy with the 110 to 12v converter they'd part with reasonably, I'd love to help you find a home for it. I also saw a setup with a panel that monitored charging of the auxiliary battery. It interfaced somehow with this 110 to 12v converter. I'm not sure if it's stock, but that sort of setup would be ideal.

Thanks! Joe
