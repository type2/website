Subject: RE: Engine Hesitation

&gt; I was merely making the point that Volkswagen distributors when found in 
&gt; crates in peoples basements
&gt; are 25 years old and not trustworthy enough to use (IMHO) on a brand new 
&gt; engine. Your vacuum advance 
&gt; stops working and you blow the motor, all because you want to have blind 
&gt; faith in VW's stock distributor. I advise YOU to 
&gt; read Muir on the why centrifigal advance is more reliable than vacum.  

Your point about pulling a distributor out of the cobwebs without
testing it is valid, but that is no reason to bash the vac. advance
distributors as a whole or the 34PICT 3. Test the vacuum advance for
leaks (not hard), check overall advance, check the dwell (stable?); if
it works it's a good distributor. I'm an amateur mechanic, but I've had
WONDERFUL success tuning an old 205 &amp; 34PICT combo for the better part
of 20 years in Bugs &amp; Splitties. Different engines, different vehicles,
no flat spots, good power (for a VW, better than my old Mazda). 

I've rebuilt multiple 34PICTs, but for the most part rely on the same
single vac. adv. 205 that's served me well since about '83... one of
these days I mean to rebuild it.

I avoid 009's... have nothing but trouble with them, but I chalk that up
to the fact that I don't run them (lack of experience), not that they
are bad. But here's another suspicion I have about new distributors... a
test I haven't run, but maybe someone should. Take a dozen new 009s,
fresh out of the box and check the curve and total advance in the same
engine (or on a test device, which I've been tempted to build). I
suspect you'll find the advance curve of these new, cheap units to be
pretty unpredictable. A good, older German BOSCH distributor will
probably yield better results, whether mechanical, vacuum, or combo, if
it's in decent shape. Just a suspicion loosely based on observations
(different dizzy's, same engine, different performance).

&gt; &gt;This argument is ridiculous at best
&gt; 
&gt; What I'm saying is Learn to drive your volkswagen! If it means riding the 
&gt; clutch alittle to smooth the dead spot, then do it. Don'be a baby about a 
&gt; little hesitation!!!!!

I would say this argument is ridiculous! Learn to TUNE your VW! Don't
ride the clutch (early clutch failure), Don't settle for dead spots,
Don't settle for hesitation. VWs _never_ would have been as popular as
they were if they ran this way new, IMHO. I believe you _can_ tune a VW
to run well with a 34PICT &amp; 009 if you tweak the carb, but the
characteristics of the stock distributor &amp; stock carb are probably
better, especially in something as heavy as the bus.

BTW: Traded a nearly new 009 at a swap last summer for a decent pair of
34PDSIT's w/manifolds. The kid looked at me like he was ripping me off,
I think I got the better deal... we are probably both ahead!
