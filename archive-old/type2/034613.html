Subject: Re: list sticker

To my knowledge there are no more list stickers. I have 30 of them left but
they are promised to the first 30 people who sent money during the last
round of list fund-raising (I have the names and addresses of you folks,
just haven't sent them out yet, I'll get on that).

So sorry, but it it is probably pointless to post any more messages about this.
