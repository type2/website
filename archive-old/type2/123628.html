Subject: Re: [T2] '69 and a '71 bus comparison !

There are lots on one year only items on 1968,1969,1970 and 1971 
buses. The biggest difference is the 1971 with front disk brakes. 
There were engine room changes each year with carbs, dizzy, gen, etc. 
1971 stock motor had dual port heads, one year only manifold, 
doghouse oil cooler and associated tin. The clutch changed somewhere 
in 1970 along with the throwout bearing and fork.

1968 had a one year only tranny gearing and CV bolts. The master 
cylinder and reservoir are one year only. Cab doors and door handles 
are 1968 only as well as the windshield wiper shafts and arms.

There are lots of subtle detail changes but really they are more 
refinements of previous years. The chances of finding a bone stock 
early bay are low. It is likely that the one year only brake cylinder 
in a 68 has been replaced with a generic 68 to 70 replacement. etc 
etc etc.

If you are not stuck on having a 1971 than make your decision based 
what is in the best shape, available and affordable to you.
