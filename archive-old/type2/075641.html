Subject: RE: [T2]  Westy Interior Panel Patterns

Re: the 78 Westy patterns - I would not count on them being the same as
those of earlier years.  I think, for this project to remain valid, we all
need to keep track of what year Westy we are taking our measurements from,
and strive to keep all patterns from like years together and separate from
those of other years. As we go, we will probably discover that certain years
are similar or identical.

For example, I would expect to find that 68 - 72 will all be identical, due
to other known similarities between those years.  But right now, I have no
way to prove that.

I imagine that later year Westy's will also fall into groups of some sort,
but I don't know enough about them to have any clue how that will turn out.

I propose we move ahead with this one step at a time.  The whole thing
started with a question about certain panels in a 71 Westy, IIRC, so let's
focus on the 71 Westy first and try to address the original poster's
question, then move on the the larger picture.

I agree, having this info available - all panels for all years - for
download, would be a great thing.

Save it in 2000, it can be opened and re-saved in any format.

Or I can manipulate it into a few different formats if you send me the .dwg
files.

Also with the university Internet connection I have I can re-send this out
to anyone that asks with your approval very easily.

I just took an AutoCAD course this semester. I am working towards an
engineering degree while I work as Library staff. In fact i am waiting for
my final grades to be posted right now - it's making me very old!!!

See ya.

Chris

P.S. I might be able to get good measurements from my headliner, sliding
door, and door panels this weekend and post the .dwg files Monday. This is
will be for a '78 Westy. Would that be the same as ane arly baywindow?

&gt;How about this:
&gt;
&gt;I'll generate a basic AutoCad .dwg for the sliding door panel, as I think
&gt;that would be the easiest/best way to get all of the necessary dimensions
to
&gt;you.   I'm no AutoCad expert, but I do use it in my work and know enough to
&gt;be dangerous.  What version - 2000, 14, 13....?
&gt;
&gt;I can plot it full size and check against my bus to be sure it fits.
&gt;
&gt;If you don't get any offers on the other panels I could check mine as best
I
&gt;can without taking stuff apart to seriously.

&gt;Actually I would be glad to make a full size (24&quot; X 36&quot;) set of blueprints
&gt;for all the 68-72 Westy interior birch panels for the VW community and even
&gt;the door panels and the kick panels too. I have most of the original pieces
&gt;and could make the prints on AutoCad, but I need 2 things:
&gt;
&gt;1) dimensions for the headliner, which I believe should be fabricated in 3
&gt;pieces. I also would need the dimensions for the driver's side panels. Russ
&gt;it would save me time if you could take some dimensions for the sliding
&gt;door. I have the rear deck lid panel and the trim pieces in the rear around
&gt;the spare tire.

&gt;
&gt;2) somebody to check the dimensions by actually using the blueprints before
&gt;making them available to the public.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody have those dimensions? A good way to check the dimensions is for
&gt;somebody to measure theirs against mine too.
