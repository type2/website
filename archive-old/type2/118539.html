Subject: Re: [T2] '72 pop top questions

&gt; I saw someone selling a upper cot from a 1970 Westy -  would this be the same style that came in my '72
originally?  Any issues with it fitting properly?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

It will fit with no problems.   68 was one-year-only but only because more screws held it to the roof.  69 to
72 are all the same. 73 is totally different and it mounted on the drivers side [left].
