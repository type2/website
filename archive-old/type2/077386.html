Subject: Re: Busted accel. cable/pedal?

This may seem obvious, but have you looked closely at the bottom of the 
pedal? There is a little &quot;l&quot; shaped piece of round metal that goes into the 
pedal mechanism below the floor. Wait, the l shaped piece is on the bottom 
of the pedal, the thing with the hole connects to the stuff below. It all 
happens insode the bus. See it? Is it in the hole? I once lost the acc. 
pedal, thinking my cable broke. I was on the hellish interstate in Dallas in 
July (argh - hot!) I got underneath with my new cable when I realized that 
the old cable was fine - the l shaped piece just came out of the hole. Maybe 
your problem, maybe not. Good luck...

Hello to all you good folks-

Having just moved out into the New Mexico desert, my garage was/is full of
stuff, thusly the bus is out in the cold. Had a good, cold morning, and
apparently my accelerator pedal froze up. Gave it a kick and it came 
unstuck.
Next morning, it did the same thing and the kick smacked it down to the 
floor.
There is now perhaps only 1 inch of play, and the vehicle will not turn over
without the punch of gas in the morning. Help! What could I be looking at
here, and can I do this myself. I'm a newbie owner and I really do not want 
to
tow this guy into the city. BTW, 1971 Campmobile.

Regards
Joshua Hinson
