If the catalytic converter is under cylinders 3&amp;4, then it is a Cal model
exhaust and probably a Cal-spec bus  if the catalytic converter is at the
rear in line with the muffler, it is a federal model exhaust.

Yes aand no.  &quot;In the day&quot; there were more federal model vanagons, but the
survival rate of Cal buses is higher, so I think it may be a wash at this
late date.  VW will still sell you (at outrageous prices!) Cal model
parts.  The fed parts are long since NLA.

Converting.... on my '80, you would need to replace the computer, the AFM,
and install a resistor pack for the injectors.  On an '83, YMMV.
