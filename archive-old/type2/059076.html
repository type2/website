Subject: RE: VW POP-TOP Roof Rack

Hi Shawn,

I have a 73 westy, and two homebuilt kayaks. I built my rack from scrap
plywood and 2 peices 8 foot long one-by-two. The crossbeams are 5/8&quot;
plywood, sculpted to fit the 'yaks and cushioned with 1&quot; foam pipe
insulation. The supports are triangles of 1/2&quot; plywood, tall enough to
clear the pop-top with height left over to meet the top of the
cross-beam. It's notched together, and comes apart to lay flat when not
in use. Its a bit tall, but I may notch the crossbeams deeper for next
season. The racks ride in the drip rails, and are tied down in the rear
to the original rack. The front is held down by the kayaks, which tie to
eyebolts on the bumper. You could figure out some tiedown to the drip
rails, I haven't needed to yet.

This rack also works well on the beach/campsite, to store the yaks when
you want the pop-top up. I'll measure it up and post plans on my site if
there's demand for it.

I have a pic of the rack on the VW (before I painted it) at:

Happy trails,

&gt;Is there some sort of a roof-rack that I could use on my '72 Westy?
The one
&gt;that it came with is great for luggage, but I wanted to get a ski rack
for my
&gt;snowboard, and was wondering if such a thing would be possible.
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Shawn
