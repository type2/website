Subject: junkyard trip

Let's try this again:

I was at a junkyard today and I have a question: There was a 74 or later
bus, looked like it wasn't a camper, and there was a hole with a slanted
tube about 2&quot; in diameter in the middle of the floor with a hinged lid
with a spring inside. What's THAT for? Just curious....

Just FYI: Whoever was looking for an oil filler tube (sans cap), there
was one lying loose in one of the busses, a 74. I didn't snag it because
I couldn't remember model year specifics on the request or
compatibilities. Also, the bus with the mysterious drain-type hole had a
molded plastic spare tire cover in that well by the back window. That
looked like an interesting item but not one I could lug around at the
time. There was some minor melting around the lower edges from the
obvious engine fire that landed the bus in the yard (sad sad sad). If
anyone has a burning need (no pun intended), I would be willing to stop
back by and pick these things up if they're still there. Or, if you're
in the Los Angeles area, you can hie yourself off to the U-Pick U-Save
on Vermont &amp; Artesia (Carson? Torrance?) and get 'em yourself.
