Its the same bus no matter how many times everything is replaced.  It 
has the same soul.  Really, Hildegarde still responds to my voice with 
her third starter in three years and brand new engine, too.  I mean, you 
can't really replace EVERYTHING, at least not over this short a period 
of time.  I mean, when you think about it, busses have only been around 
for not even 50 years...
