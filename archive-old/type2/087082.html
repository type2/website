&gt; Well I dropped by Buggy World yesterday to arrange having Buster towed 

where are you located, I have no idea where in the world Buggy is?

&gt; in. The guy asked me what was wrong with it. I explained how the starter 
&gt; went out and it was making a racket and the puttering sound it made 
&gt; before that when it was sorta running and he tells me I sucked a valve, 

if it was running at all it was probably not fatal.  What year is this bus
engine?

&gt; mentioned something about the heads, showed me another buses engine he 
&gt; was working on and tells me yours is the same as this one. Then he kills 
&gt; me with &quot;it will be about $4,000 to fix it&quot;.

a new rebuilt head is a bit over $100 at Bus Depot.  you can buy a lot of
tools and places to work on it for the left over $3,875.00

&gt; even looking at it. So what do I do now? I can't tow the bus all over 
&gt; town, but unless I know for sure what's wrong I don't know if I can 
&gt; afford to even have it fixed. If it's that much I'll just have to sell 
&gt; him. The worst thing is, Buster is parked at my apartment building I 
&gt; moved out of 2 weeks ago and I can't bring him to my new place so I 
&gt; don't know what to do about it now.

rent a two car garage somewhere, tall enough so that you can jack the bus
up inside the garage.  and have it towed there.

 then you have some time to think and get your options together

Good Luck,  BTDT
