Subject: Re: [T2] removing purple window tint

Try a produck called &quot;Goof Off&quot; .  It's available here in Canada and I'm sure
there's got to be that or something similar in the US.  It works wonders.   A
simple razor blade scraper would do the trick as well.

&gt; Does anyone know what will get the glue off my front windows after I peeled
&gt; the purple tint off?
