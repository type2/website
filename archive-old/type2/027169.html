We payed 20k for our 95 with 56k miles back in 98. I think the pricing might 
be a bit high. The true blue book values on the EVCs can only be checked 
through the &quot;extra&quot; book that KBB publishes for recreational vehicles. Any 
bank should have one.

Did you perform all the 60K maintenance on it (timing belt &amp; serentine belt 
replacement etc...)??? If so then $20k might not be a bad price.

Just my 2cents
