        I would look first at the parts of the fuel injection system that
play a role when the engine is cold.  That is, look there first
after doing &quot;step zero&quot; of fuel injection diagnosis:  make sure that
the ignition system is operating at 100%.

        The L-Jetronic has subsystems which are analagous to the cold
operating systems on a carburetor; it has provisions to increase
the airflow and enrich the mixture.

        The VW carb uses the choke &amp; the fast idle cam to assist in cold
running conditions.  When cold, the carb has a bimetal spring that
engages the choke and puts the throttle lever high up on the fast
idle cam.  The choke makes it run rich, and the fast idle cam basically
&quot;steps on the gas&quot; for you.  A current begins to run through the
choke's bimetal spring as soon as the ignition is switched on; this
warms the spring &amp; gradually releases the choke and the fast idle
cam.

        L-Jet uses an auxilliary air regulator instead of the fast idle
cam of the carb.  The auxilliary air regulator is basically an air
passageway that allows air to pass from in front of the throttle's
butterfly valve to behind it--in effect, it's like a hole in your
throttle butterfly valve; like &quot;stepping on the gas&quot; for you.  There
is a valve in this auxilliary air passageway; when the engine is
cold, it lets lots of air through.  When the engine is hot, it blocks
this off.  Just like the fast idle cam!

        The brain decides to enrich the mixture during cold running by
monitoring the temperature of the intake air and the cylinder
head.  There is a separate temperature sender for each task.  When
the engine is cold, the brain increases the duration of each
injector's pulse; your engine runs rich, as if a choke was on.
The temperature senders are semiconductor devices whose resistance
*decreases* with increasing temperature.  (Er, at least that's
how they work on my D-Jet squareback.)

        I would look at the performance of the auxilliary air regulator and
the temperature senders (assuming the ignition system is solid as a
rock!) before suspecting the fuel pump or the air flow meter.

        Also--don't suspect the cold-start valve or &quot;fifth injector.&quot;
This *only* operates when both the starter is engaged *and* it's
cold.  Even then it will only run for a few seconds so that flooding
is prevented.  Often people believe that this injector runs the
whole time that the engine is cold; it cannot, since it gets its
+12V directly from the starter circuit.  Starter off?  5th injector
is off, too.  Er, unless it's leaky. ;)

Good luck!
