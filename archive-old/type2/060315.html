Subject: More on engine noises.

Hi Volks,
               OK, I've had some more input on my blowing noise and also managed to do some archive searching (was having problems accessing them previously- network issues at my end, I think). It seems to me from what I've read that head problems with the type-4 engine are rare whereas heat exchanger leaks are relatively common. Given that one of the things I found while looking for leaks is that at least one of the exchanger support brackets has rusted out it seems likely that my problem is  exchanger-related rather than a more serious head problem (phew!).
 I need new exchangers anyway to get some heat this winter and so I guess I'll collect the parts I need to refurbish this system (and meanwhile start soaking everything in penetrating oil). Hopefully getting spiffy new exchangers and replacing the gaskets and mountings will sort things out.
 Thanks a lot for the advice so far (especially Steve) and please let me know if there's any other things I should worry about while contemplating this job: Would it, for example, be  worth splitting the exhaust nuts off the studs rather than even trying to undo them, since this would protect the studs and I'm probably going to replace them anyway?

Cheers,
              W.
