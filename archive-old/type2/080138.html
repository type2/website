Subject: # 1 EXHAUST VALVE SINKING

hi  to everyone

I have a 73 2 litre kombi camper, over the last few months the engine
has been losing power and backfiring causing the vacuum hose elbows to
detach from the metal hoses, when i checked the valve clearances number
1 exhaust didn't have any clearance so I adusted to 6 mm then after a
monthe it happened again and I adjusted again two weeks past and it
happened again so i adjusted again.
The adustments have caused the end of the valve to extend out toward me
much more than the other valves.
I wonder what is happening, is the valve stretching?
what can be done about it?.

please help
