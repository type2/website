Subject: NOS type 4 heads

I have two brand new Porsche 912E 2.0 heads new in their 
Porsche boxes, in thick cosmoline. I had one out of the boxes 
a few times late at night just to stare at it :) ..  They have 
the EGR holes, and I have the correct plugs to close them off 
if needed. They are bare, and have seats and valve guides installed.
I am interested in trading them for equally NEW/NOS original VW or 
Porsche 1.7 heads. I am still trying to work out what is best for 
my application. But I am quite sure the 1.7s are the way to go. 
A 1.7 head can be recognized by measuring the bore diameter in 
the head, it should be 100mm. (As I don't have a 1.7 head right 
here to check, pls let me know if they are NOT 100mm)
