Subject: How do you set a float?

Fellow Bussers...

    Before I do something rash like put my bus to rest with a shotgun blast
or actually take it to a shop, I thought I'd run this by the list.  I
couldn't find anything in the archives about it.
    First the question, then the background if you're interested.
    Question 1: How do you set a carb float? (Dual Solexes on a '72)  I'm
assuming by bending the arm to different heights?  If so, how do you know
when you've got it set right?
    Question 2: After bending the float arm to set it, does it have a
tendency to bend back to it's original position over time?
    The Background:   I have been battling a chronic *fuel in the crankcase*
problem for months now.  I've installed a pressure regulator for the
electric fuel pump.  I've rebuilt both carbs with new needle valves.  I
played with many different float settings.  Sometimes it'll go for weeks
without a problem and then one day, whammo!  There's that awful gas smell in
the oil again.  This latest time, I didn't get the obvious sign of gas
leaking from the throttle plate bushings, but there were literally quarts of
gas in the engine after it sat a couple of days.  It's obviously siphoning
through the carbs into the crankcase as it sits, and the only weak link I
can think of is the float setting.  I have never seen a description of how
to properly set a float's height in the bowl.  Anybody know this one?   I
would be forever grateful for anyone who could help me bring Gus the Bus
back from his vegetative state in my driveway!
