Subject: [T2] Fuel line in a FI bus

Greetings,
     I am getting ready to return to service, my '76 Deluxe Westy.  While I
have the engine out, I plan to replace all the fuel line (with fuel injected
rated hose).  What length of fuel line will I need to buy in order to
replace all the fuel line?  Also, I think that the clutch operating fork
might be broken.  Does anyone have an extra clutch fork that they are
willing to part with?  If so, how much?

Thanks,
Stuart Neil
