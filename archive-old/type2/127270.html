Subject: RE: [T2] Dim Alternator Light With Headlights On 

That sounds very possible. I think it would be safe to disconnect the deep cycle and run the bus to see what happens. Check the system voltage before and after, that would really tell you.

Hey, Rick, thanks for the hint...

I have a new, main battery, but my deep cycle battery looks to be some 20 
years old (vehicle was in storage since 1989)

Maybe the deep cycle battery is trying to gain a charge with the engine 
running, but it might be really dry, and with the extra drain because of the 
headlights, I might be drawing more than my generator is able to push out.

Doses that seem possible/likely?? I hope it is that simple....
