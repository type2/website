Subject: Re: [T2] friday on a saturday

Steve,

Could be that 3.2% already own every tool that they could possibly need!

Of course, we know that the 91% or so &quot;male&quot; readers could not 
possibly ever imagine  already owning every tool that they would ever 
need&lt;VBG&gt;!

The ladies say &quot;You can't ever be too rich or too skinny!&quot;
The guys say   &quot;You can never have enough tools!&quot;


ROTFLOL!!!!

Just what I needed on a dreary cold wet Saturday afternoon when I can't go 
finish my headliner....

Cheers, dave

&gt; Dave,

&gt; I love it!!!  The most interesting meta-analysis is:
&gt; 
&gt; Readers &quot;Always or Sometimes&quot; Perform Maintenance on Own Vehicle.......91.0%
&gt; 
&gt; TOOL OWNERSHIP (Purchased or Plan to Purchase in the Next 12 Months.)
&gt; Automotive Hand Tools.........................87.8%
&gt; 
&gt; which means to me that 3.2% of VWT readers are chewing the nuts off with
&gt; their teeth! (that or 3.2% of VWT readers count &quot;filling the gas tank&quot; as
&gt; maintainance :-)
