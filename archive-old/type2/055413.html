Subject: engine won't start

Hi,
 
English is not my first language so please excuse the writing and spelling !
 
Since 1 year I'm the proud owner of a 1979 VW pick-up, single cab.
We bought it without an engine.
A month or two later, we found this 1800cc, flat type 4 engine and installed it into the bus.
When I fill up the carbs with fuel, the bus will start at a very high rpm and die after 30 seconds (depending on how much fuel I put in). The engine does turn over but won't start when I don't fill the carbs with fuel.
What could be the problem I'm dealing with ?
 
Hope you can give me some advice !
 
Paul
