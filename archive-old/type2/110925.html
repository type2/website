&gt;&gt; ah ha,, check all your heavy ground wires from the frame to the tranny...
&gt;
&gt;Ya know, I've never been able to figure out where those ground straps
&gt;actually are, or at least I've never been able to spot them while under the
&gt;bus.
&gt;
&gt;And my starter finally quit weeks ago (lots of gentle inclines for starting
&gt;down here, if you're careful where you park), and still trying to fit a
&gt;rebuilt into the budget.
&gt;
&gt;I'd look in my Haynes (haven't been able to get the other books, yet), but
&gt;can't figure out where I left it last.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone out there have a pic of an actual trannie w/straps installed?
&gt;
&gt;[keeps looking for his manual...]
&gt;
what straps are you speaking of mike?
the ground that runs off the drivers side of the tranny to the frame????
i only have one strap ?

braided wire...
