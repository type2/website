Subject: RE: [T2] Dual carb troubleshooting techniques needed

Hi Volks-  a hint on sync's dual carbs (from MUD). Use monometer (a tool
used to sync multiple carbs on motorcycles) connected to the balance tube
between the carb's.  This will give you readings of both carbs at once,
without changing a carb syncing tool between carb's. Much easier and you can
check the balanced at higher RPM at the same time.  It works,  is much
easier and generally more accurate. TBear

Don't take life to seriously -- you'll never live throught it....
