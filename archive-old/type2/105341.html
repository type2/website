&lt;I gotta remember to change the subject line when in digest mode!!&gt; JB

&gt;&gt; I understand that 260 and beyond will break down the oil, so if I have to
&gt;take a long trip and it exceeds these numbers, I will change the oil as
&gt;soon as I can.

&gt;260 is WAY past the polymer breakdown temp. If you are running 10-40 or
&gt;20-50, when the polymers go you are left with the viscosity of the base
&gt;oil: either 10 or 20.
&gt;Go here: http://www.vtr_dot_org/maintain/lubricants-redline.html and read the
&gt;section on Viscosity Index Improvers. Polymer breakdown starts at 210....
&gt;More info here: http://www.eskimo_dot_com/~dalus/bmw/all/misc/all_oilfaq.html
&gt;but he does not mention the temp.

Bummer. I guess I cannot drive my van anymore, can I? :-)

Every air cooled VW, when the ambient temp exceeds 90 degrees, is going to
go past 210 degrees. 

I have read a ton on it and find manufacturers have conflicting numbers
all over the place. I think 210 is much to low of a number. I have been
told by many on this and other lists that they sometimes exceed 260 as a
matter of course. When the machine is air-cooled, and the tin is there,
the oil cooler is clear, the motor is clean, and the fan is working, if
you are cruising, and it hits 250, there is not much you can do..... I
just change it often and since it is closing in on 200K miles original
everything, I guess the &quot;facts&quot; don't always mean much.

Probably the biggest conflict I came up against was the idea of 'where in
the motor' should the temp be taken, and the answer is, no one knows,
because there are going to be places where the oil will exceed 260 on
every motor. Its a tough one to call. I only use mine as a reference. The
fact that others see theirs at 190-210 most of the time, and mine says
220-240, it took me a while to get comfortable and realize that it is
mostly just relative and not very scientific. I'm pretty sure an archive
search will turn up tons of folks who exceed 210 degress regularly.

I don't stay at 250-260 very long if I can avoid it, but its not like I
can turn on the heater and take away some of the high temps :-)

Thanks for the info tho.
