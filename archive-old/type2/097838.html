Subject: Suggestions?:covert stereo installation. 

I'm fixin to put anoter stereo into my 78 transporter.  I've been without
a stereo since my last one got stolen.

I don't want to get another stereo stolen and I don't want to deal with a
pullout type stereo( I can handle taking the face off).

My rear speakers will be hidden under the reat seats in wooden boxes. 
Thin fabric conseals the speaker grills.

I'm thinking of doing the same thing for the fron speakers.  I want to
mount my oil press. and oil temp gaugues in the dash where the stereo
would normally be.

Does anybody have any suggestions for where to mount the head unit?  I
think there might be enough room to mount it undeneath the dash and
fabricate the mount the swing down.  I'm also thinking of building an
armrest/console the would secure the stereo and keep it hidden.  Both
options seem like a lot of work.

Glove box you say?  You may be right.  Seems like a waste of prime
dashboard storage to me.

thanks.
