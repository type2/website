&gt; I've been looking for this brass ring terminal for the battery terminal:
&gt; The original AMP terminal had one built in and It let's you quickly

&gt; Does anyone know of a vendor that sells this ring terminal? You'd
&gt; think it was pretty common but I can't find it anywhere.

I got one very similar at West Marine,
