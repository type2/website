Subject: My brother is going to get a bus!

Alright!, Thanksgiving is fun!

My lil' brother came home from college, and told me that he wants to get a vw 
bus, possibly a camper, but probably a passenger van. I am very excited.

My other younger brother had a bus (74 passenger), for a couple years, but 
lost interest, and ended up blowing a rod. This brother, on the other hand, 
will take care of what ever he gets, and man, he is pretty excited when he 
talks about it.

Now all we got to do is shop around. I think I will try and pay for most of 
it, but I won't tell him until we find the one. It will be a Christmas 
present. YEP, Christmas is just around the corner once again.

Take care all, and have a great holiday.
