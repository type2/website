Subject: Re: [T2] Driving a bus

&lt;&lt; I have read the Muir section on driving a bus and was wondering how many

follow that advice to the letter? It seems kinda nutty to drive in 3rd gear

above 45mph...in my '71 the engine sounds like it is turning to fast in 3rd

gear at 45mph...or is that just because I am use to driving jap cars?


Thanks Volks,

In other circles, it's called an Italian tune-up... ;-)
