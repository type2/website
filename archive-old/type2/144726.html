Hmmm, what kind of metal is that you took off the plug?  The picture is a
bit blurry, but it might be a helicoil that unscrewed accidently with the
plug.  You might be able to carefully reinsert it and get the plug back
in, but that isn't a permanent fix.

You can also get a rubber expandable drain plug at a FLAPS, but that is a
temporary solution also.

Your best bet is to drill and tap for an oversize drain plug or for a good
insert (timesert, etc, not helicoil) to make a lasting fix.
