Subject: Re: Awful knocking noise from rear axle....Help appreciated

Nicholas,
If its not the nut on the stub axle, that Rod suggests and which btw needs 
to be torqued to 250 ft-lbs!, then it has to be one of the two CV joints on 
that half axle. You may find that the rubber boot covers that Mike suggests 
are o.k., in which case you may just be low on grease in the cv joints. This 
moly-based grease has a tendency over time to slowly leak out of the joint 
flange and ultimately the joint runs dry enough to bind up. If you get to it 
quickly with an application of grease you can save the joint.
If that is the case, just remove the six socket head bolts in each flange, 
after cleaning the outside of the flanges so as not to get dirt in the 
joint, pull back the flange, and apply a few oz. of cv-joint or moly-based 
chassis grease to the joint (if done sequentially, you don't actually remove 
the entire half-shaft)  Then replace and torque the bolts to 25 ft.lbs, 
using new lock washers. I've also read of using a needle-type grease 
injector on a grease gun to inject grease between the shaft and the collar 
at the small end of the boot, but haven't tried this yet.
Awful knocking is the sound of a sticking cv-joint that is hollering for 
grease!
