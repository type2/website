Subject: tents and leaks

{{I have to say this,,,nobody trenches around their tent anymore. Low
impact is a good skill to work on with
the number of people who take to the woods these days.}}

speaking of low impact. . .we could all impact the woods a lot less and 
the planet as well if we would just limit our families. Even if we 
practice low impact in the woods, when the population doubles again in 34 
years, will it even matter?
