I have just put about 100 piccies of Clara &amp; my trip to BC
the website location is:

http://members.xoom_dot_com/sglw/bc1 &amp; 2 are the days before the show

I will be updating the text but there were some really neat buses
1, the orange double slider
2, the early British westy with a chimney for the fridge in the back
3, the radar bus with the opening in the passenger side, 2 generators &amp; 3 
batteries
4, the bus with no back hatch
5 the really original Italian red 63 singlecab that is now British
6, the supercharged buses
bunches of KDF beetles, schwimwagens etc. ...    single &amp; doublecab crane 
trucks
ambulances
taxis
etc
plus a six cylinder two stroke motorcycle

I will get the text to the page in over the weekend
unfortunately I had the camera set on normal resolution so the PICS are not 
high res. But good enough for web work.
