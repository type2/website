Subject: engine no start update

I thought I would update the list on how I am making out with my bus. I 
installed a rebuilt motor
and at first the engine would not turn over. That turned out to be a 
wrong connection at the starter.
Then I could turn it over,but it wouldn't start. That proved to be a 
coil or condensor or both. I also needed to pull dist gear back tooth. 
That way I could get the range I needed to time the motor without
the dist  hitting the cold start valve.I got it running now ,but I have 
a exhaust leak. It's between the head
and heater box. I took and opened up the holes on the box. I also 
checked to be sure both ends are flat and equal to each other. I took 
tonight and ground down on the flange where the bolt goes through
thinking maybe the new box is bottoming out. I'll put that back on 
tomorrow when the new gaskets come in. Hopefully that works. I also have 
oil gushing out the valve covers. The covers I think have a slight twist 
to them keeping them from sealing. So maybe tomorrow I'll get to drive 
this thing. Wish me luck.
