Subject: Westy Top Compatibility

Simple question, hopefully simple answer......
 
Would a 69 Westfalia pop top be a direct swap, (ie, just take the bolts  out, 
take it off, put it on and put the bolts in) with a 72 Westfalia pop  top?
 
I know they both go the same direction, but are there any dimensional  
differences or hardware differences that I should know about?
 
I have a line on a replacement one for the 72 that my brother just picked  
up, but the top is beat.  Cracked fiberglass, rotted wood etc.
 
Anyone able to shed light on this one for me?
 
Thanks!
 
~Jeremy
