Subject: Re: Adjustable FI -Mark Stephens Article  (fwd)

&gt;Listees:
&gt;I saw an interesting article in this month's (March)  &quot;HOt VW's&quot; It was
&gt;about a new package of 96mm p&amp;c s for type 4s.  The article's text didn't
&gt;mention this in the text but the illustrations show a combination of a O2
&gt;sensor, a CB fuel ratio gauge, and a variable resistor to real time adjust
&gt;your fuel mixture so you don't burn up your engine with the new p&amp;c's and
&gt;the higher resulting CR.  Does anyone else have any information on this.
&gt;How about you Dolan.  This seems like your kind of a contraption?  What do
&gt;you all think.
&gt;
&gt;Have fun

Actually Steve and I were speaking to this topic this weekend, and some
thoughts.  First thought, before anyone goes out and orders a set of the 96's
from Stephens, you might want to call one of the high end T4 rebuilders (I'm
not going to name names, the kind of place that wants $5000 for a quality
large T4) and get some opinions on those Asian barrels, can U say radial
cracks visible to the EYE in the skirts!!!  I don't doubt it, anyway on other
matters.  I had a nice pot in the head temp circuit in Steves when we first
got it up and running, but this was unfortunately when he had the '80 CA FI
in the thing that had some unknown problem.  Tinkering with the head sensor
certainly does tinker with the mixture, but to think you'll be able to do
it real
time in some manner is a crap shoot as the sender is highly nonlinear, and
as you'll always be behind the curve, they make a real thing to do is, it was
called the CA injection systesm with the stock O2 sesor, which alone will
not compensate for a 2165, but might for a 2055 from 96mm P&amp;C's.  Steve is
I hope going to try to put the pot back in and try it now with the '78 FI,
as he
has been running the thing ruthlessly lean since he got tired of his higher
pressure fuel regulator (the old fix) blowing off gas lines.  Not an idea
fix, some
more interesting thoughts for a big T4, first of course KE-Jetronic, fairly
proven
but real involved conversion.  Something I was looking at this weekend though
bears investigation.  The Volvo 240 series of the early 80's uses L-Jet with
the more modern hot wire anemometer AFM, capable of flowing a hell of a lot
more air, uses similar injectors (I'm sure the Volvo ECU would drive the Bus
injectors,) uses an O2 sensor, an ISV on later models though the '81 I think
uses a bypass air valve just like ours, and is by nature designed for a 2.2
liter
engine made for low revs, just like us.  The only thing I don't know is how
the
head temp sensor input would work for the coolant temp sensor on the Volvo
stuff, and of course you'd have to rewire the harness to match the Volvo ECU.
Still if anyone has a blown 240 sitting around, would be worth a whirl.
Anyway
don't necessarily believe anyone who will tell you you'll just go and get that
monstrous T4 running on stock FI parts, I'd demand to see one, or get the cost
of tuning your bus to do so included in the price of the engine.  A lot of
people
say a lot of things will do it, Steve can attest that when you get there
they say,
&quot;what aren't you running dual carbs?&quot;
