&lt;&lt; The 76-79 Westy came as a standard or deluxe model.  The standard model 
came with an icebox rather than a fridge and a sink, but no stove.  I think 
the
 standard also lacked the trash can and fire extinguisher.  

The only extras the deluxe had was the stove with a flip up cover, AC/DC 
fridge (not propane), trash can with matching plaid cover, and fire 
extinguisher. &gt;&gt;

My 79 deluxe also has a system for charging the onboard auxilary battery from 
110V AC current and also a panel that monitors battery condition. It may 
simply be considered a part of the refigerator system and not an extra option.

I have also heard talk of &quot;weekenders&quot; and &quot;hard top&quot; Westphalia conversions 
without the upper loft.  I have also seen what appear to be authentic 
conversions without the upper rear cabinet.  Are these formal models offered 
by Westphalia?  Could you ever order varying degrees of options or are these 
simply owner modified/created campers using campers and buses and mixing and 
matching standard and deluxe equipment?
