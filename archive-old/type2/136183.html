Just because you CAN, doesn't mean you SHOULD!  This
has you travelling regularly at only 4 MPH lower than
the top end speed. Imagine driving your T*yota, or
N*ssan, or whatever consistently at speeds of 100 mph,
the wear and tear on the engine would be extreme. 
Same thing in your bus. It blows my mind when I hear
about people talking about cruising at 70mph all the
time in their bus. Look at the size of your engine
compared to the weight of your bus, compounded by the
lack of aerodynamics, now push the thing up to
5000-6000 rpms and maintain it?!?! 
No thanks, I'll continue to enjoy my bus at a speed of
about 53 mph (71 with 1600 DP).  If there is someplace
I need to get to fast, as in I would need to drive 65
MPH plus, then you'll find me in my SUV!!
By the way, I have been driving buses for about 10
years now, and I have NEVER once broken down...
