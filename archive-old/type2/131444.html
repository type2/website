Subject: Metal Brake Lines

Help requested on ID of Brake Lines (metal)

What is the part number and length of the long, central metal brake line in 
a '72-'79 VW type2??

I have a metal brake line with part # 221 611 724A and I measured it to be 
approx 48.5&quot; long.  Is this the correct part number and length?

Thanks
