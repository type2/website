Subject: Re: [T2] Which is right or left?

&gt; &lt;&lt; And to think that I always figured that port/larboard was for parallel
&gt;
&gt; parking and starboard was the side of the bus that had my imaginary VW
&gt;
&gt; factory mounted sextent.

us americans are bass-ackwards it seems.
only a rhd bus has its steering properly on the starboard and
loading properly should be on the larboard.
