Subject: Re: [T2]Bus-A-Thon and related subjects!

Hi John Here
I wanted to add some more ideas about the I am going to live in my bus Help!
I came up with the idea as a laughing to myself joke, but with some 
consideration its
not such a bad idea.  I bet someone out there could get the ball rolling on 
corporate
sponsorship for advertisements on all kinds of outdoor and survival stuff. 
Mob out to get you for those counterfeit Phish tickets and you have to live 
through the winter in your bus use Coleman camping heater and lighting 
accessories.
  Well, onto the other thing I caught a lot of heat about this tire or no 
tire deal.
All these structural engineers came out of the woodwork. Hey got a problem 
with the Bus do something then. I don't care what you come up with it wont be 
enough.
Busses have to much of a straight frame it wont collapse. Enough said.
                                                                     JPB2001
