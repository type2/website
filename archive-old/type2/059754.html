Subject: Earl Mann's In Ardmore

I stopped there on my travels last year.  Earl and his son's were really
nice to me and sat and talked for a few.

He has some great bugs and busses to look at, mostly junk but what the
heck, there fun too, plus you might find little trinkets and tidbits known
as treasure to some of us.

Tell him I said hi but I am sure he will not remember me.  To remind him
tell him that I was the big guy from Georgia that stopped in.  He showed me
a couple of the MUGS Root Beer Bugs he was building.

He is a fine gentlman.
