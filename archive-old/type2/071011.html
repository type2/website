Subject: Heat exchangers
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Ok, I've been reading a lot about heat exchangers lately.  This is what I've 
done so far.  First of all, I have a '78 Westy, and the exhaust was in very 
poor condition.  The first thing I did was purchase a pair of heater boxes 
that came off of a '72.  The exhaust ports are exactly the same.  ('79 and on 
have sqaure ports..I think)
    Anyway, I completely cleaned all the rust off of the heater boxes, and 
then brazed the exhaust tubes where they enter into the heater boxes.  I also 
brazed any and all small holes and air leaks.  Doing this also made the 
heater boxes rigid.  The tin of the heater boxes no longer rattle around the 
exhaust going through them.  Then I treated them with por-15's metal primer 
and then followed the instructions to the letter for applying por-15.  
    I then removed my old exhaust and installed the new heater boxes.  I also 
had to change the heater control flaps, and a tube coming from the auxilliary 
fan to the right-side heater box.  I also installed a used header and muffler 
that fit appropriately.    It's been about a month since I did this.  I 
haven't quite yet finished, there are still a couple of loose ends that I 
need to tie up, but the temp now coming out of the defrost vents is averaging 
about 110 degrees farenheit _at_ 35 miles an hour.  About 123 degrees _at_ 60 mph.  
I have plans on insulating all the airs ducts, and I've already made the air 
recirculating.  I also want to do some sound proofing and body 
insulating.....any questions?

ps.(Step studs are very difficult to find....so be careful when removing your 
exhaust...if they're stubborn, take it easy...heat them up, or soak them with 
penetrating oil...and remember everyone...keep a fire extinguisher close 
by...always a good idea)
