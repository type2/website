Subject: Help, spillt oil !!

While preparing my '69 microbus for a little trip this weekend I was topping
off the oil. I had a jar thas was less than 1/4 full and thought I could
just put it in. Well, space is confined in the engine compartment and
somehow I managed to spill most of it rather than get it in the engine. It
can't have been much as there was less than half a pint in the jar to begin
with.

Anyway I now have very shiney engine tin on the pass. side :-). I wiped off
as much as I could  but oil was already leaking from under the engine.

Will this do any harm ? Or have VW engineers anticipated clumsy people like
me and provided for a safe path out of the engine? Any fire hazard ?
