Bob,

Yea,-------
But you don't live here in the Windy, where the calcium chloride that
they throw on the streets doesn't only dry things up, but it eats away
the body panels !!!

Not here---------Park it or paint it !! 

And seeing as how my bus is rust free--no thanks.

E-mail message---   
 
During the lay-up season for my Westy, and just when I'm not driving it, 
I just solve the problem by driving mine all year round.
