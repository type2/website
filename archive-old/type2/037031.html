&gt; &gt; I was worried about the position of my dist driveshaft too, so i checked

&gt; &gt; the drive gear on the crank. Did i miss it?

&gt; When the engine is at TDC on the fireing stroke  of #1, then the slot in
&gt; the distributor drive should be across the width of the engine and offset
&gt; to the rear.  Kind of a puzzle when the engine is apart as in Wilson.

Volks...

The slot in the dist drive for the T1 engine and the slot for the dist
drive for the T4 engine get lined up at separate angles!  This is shown
(tho puzzlingly) in the Bentley manual on page 24 of the engine section.

Type 1 case:

With #1 at TDC, the slot in the dist drive should be at
right angles to the case seam (parallel to the rear of the case).  the
slot is a hair off center and the slot should be toward the rear of the
bus/case.

Type 4 case:

At TDC for #1, picture a line thru the center of the drive hole in the
case that is parallel to the seam in the case.  Now rotate this line anti-
(counter-) clockwise 12 degrees  the off center slot should be at this
angle, with the slot away from the centerline of the case.

Now go look at the pictures in the book, and see how hard these
descriptions were to write :-)

A lot of dist misalignments are caused by old timers (like me) who have
worked on a lot of T1 engines using the same spec on T4's, then wondering
why the vac can runs into something.

&gt; 
&gt; I think that the endplay setting is overrated.  this thing doesn't wear
&gt; much in normal use, there is a spring to keep the drive against the shims,
&gt; and that should take care of any slop in the system.  The VW manual
&gt; doesn't even address endplay that I can see, instead just telling you to
&gt; be sure to install the two washers/shims.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is it true that as long as the cam/crank relationship is right (dot on cam
&gt; &gt; gear between the two on the crank) all should be well?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, the drive may be mispositioned, which is important if you are using
&gt; a vacuum advance distributor, as you won't be able to position it
&gt; properly.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; There is no 'backwards' for the dist drive gear or the driveshaft, right?
&gt; &gt; Right?!?
&gt; 
&gt; No backwards, except in relation to TDC on #1.
