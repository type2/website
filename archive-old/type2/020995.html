I didn't say easy. But I would rank retorquing the heads not too easy.

&gt; But what did you attach the throttle body
&gt; to?  weber-style center section? I swear it would fit...but I dunno how
&gt; the plenum chamber would effect the TB...probably not at all, since the
&gt; mix is happening after that...

David:

From what I've read, your absolutely right.  The 2 barrel progressive
throttle body from a rabbit will fit a webber progressive manifold. 
However, I used the single 45 mm throttle body with the b**tle manifold
and plenum chamber/generator stand. There is a cast in boss on the left
side (FIF) that I tapped for the brake booster. It seemed easier.  I had
to drill another hole for the accelerator cable on the left of the
doghouse cooler.  Also, the FI beetle dizzy is very close to the stock
unit for my 71.  I figured the vacuum can was the same. So I have my
stock 71 dual vac dizzy hooked up, both advance and retard.  According
to the timing light it works just fine.
