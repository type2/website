&gt; I have a horn Q too.  My horn only works occasionally, but even then, only
&gt; with the hibeam switch when the headlights are off.  Any suggestions?  Bad
&gt; ground?  How to trace?
&gt;

Assuming your highbeam switch is column, not floor, mounted, I'd look for a
short somewhere inside the steering column since the highbeam switch and
horn grounding switch are both located there. Somethin's hittin' somethin'.
