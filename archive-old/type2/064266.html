Subject: Generator job

Unless I'm overlooking something you can do the generator job with the engine in
the car.  I've done lots of them on single and dual port engines 1300 to 1600.
Take out the carburetor (two 13 mm nuts.  the one in the back is harder. I use a
13 mm wrench cut in half so as to be short)  Remove the strap that holds the
generator to the  oil pedestal.  Remove the four 10 mm bolts that hold the
backing plate of the generator to the fan housing.  Loosen the two screw on each
end the fan housing which hold the fan housing to the side tin.  Wiggle and take
the generator out.  You'll need a big socket to get the fan off of the
generator.   Kind of a pain in the rear end but not really that hard once you
realize that you have to take a lot of things off to get it out..
A lot of folks leave the lower right 10 mm bolt off on the re-install (or is it
the lower left??) because it is really difficult to get to.      John Jensen in
