If you are talking about what goes inside the bus to cover teh rear parcel
shelf... read on.

i am the third owner of my 71 deluxe bus as far as i know.  Over the rear
deck it had a masonite panel with grey carpet/felt looking stuff covering
it. I dont recall how it was held down, but if its an issue i can go look.

i camperized my bus because the last owner came this close to burning it
to a crisp, so the hardboard/carpet panel is burnt up at the corners, but
im pretty sure its original, as the bus was almost 100% hack free when i
got it. (although it _was_ cinderized and rusty in places, heh)

peas,

Steve
