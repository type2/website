Subject: Re: [T2] Rocky Mountian Motorworks catalogues

Next time you place an order - tell them to include one in the package.

&gt;Is RMMW making their nifty catalogues any longer? They refuse to send one up
&gt;here to Canada to me, even though I've bought tons of stuff from them. This
&gt;is weird. Is it out of print or something? Anybody got one kicking around
&gt;they'd be willing to mail? Of course I'll pay for it.
