Subject: Gasoline rot in fuel lines ?

Hiyall,

Here in California we have gas that has been officially formulated
by Satan.  Being a VW owner I often am at various FLAPS, wherein I
run into other VW owners looking for fuel hoses.  Many are very &quot;wet&quot;
looking...which is a danger as well as a pain.

I'd like to hear from others who are finding their fuel hoses turning
to mush (just like &quot;Andromeda Strain&quot;) no matter what state you are in.
Have &quot;solves&quot; been found ?  Is it just German made hoses having the
prob ?  What happened to real satire in America ?  Is it a government
plot ?  Are we being &quot;hosed&quot; ?

Anyone ?
