&gt;VWOA finally agreed to buy the car back

	This recalls one of the first BMW 7's to be brought into New 
Zealand.  The brother-in-law of a friend of mine was supplied with it 
by his firm, who thought a $165k car would be a suitable image for 
them. In those days there were only half a dozen computers in the 
car; the master agents for NZ changed each of these at least once 
(list price $1-2k each, but done on the warranty of course).  But the 
car never ran reliably.  In the end the NZ distributors freighted the 
whole plurry thang back to Munich.  That was, I believe, an 
unprecedented admission of defeat.
	The head of BMW engine development later published his 
reasons for having opposed computer control of cars.  They looked 
eminently sensible to me.
	Since then, newer versions have become more reliable.  But 
once they start going wrong, they can be much harder to diagnose &amp; 
fix than a carb and (modern versions of) distributor ignition.   I am 
glad I have a carb, not FI; my dizzie isn't the most reliable version 
of that technology, but can be improved.  I feel no need for 
computers in the vehicle.
