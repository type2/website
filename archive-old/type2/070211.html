&gt;one thing i am looking for (besides an electric fridge for really 
&gt;cheap), is a small water pump for my sink.  of course the original one 
&gt;is kaput.  i cannot seem to find a suitable electric replacement.  the 
&gt;only ones i have found are huge and expensive.  any suggestions?

I replaced my sink water pump ('78 Westy) with a unit from 
Camping World. Just like the old one, cost about $25.

Good luck,
Surfer Bob
