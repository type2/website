&gt; Harking back to the thread on type4 engines in
&gt; military drones.
&gt; About 10 years ago, i went to a military tech
&gt; conference. They has several drone models. The U.S.
&gt; Nave and Army had sophisticated ones and the Israelis
&gt; had a cruder model that had been extensively tested in
&gt; combat conditions.
&gt;
&gt; They all had small lawn mower-sized engines, built by
&gt; U.S. companies. A developer of one of the U.S. models
&gt; said one of the things they were trying to perfect was
&gt; a cheap, light engine that would perform well--but
&gt; wear out in a few hours. The reason: some of the
&gt; drones were meant to be throw-aways, because they
&gt; would follow enemy surface-to-air missile radar down
&gt; and destroy it--kamakazi. Even the survaillence drones
&gt; weren't expected to have a long life expectancy even
&gt; if they did make it back to base a couple times. Most
&gt; of the data the drones collected would be transmitted
&gt; back in &quot;real time.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Hmmm, a cheap, one-year disposable engine (like
&gt; contact lenses and Kleenex) is an interesting concept
&gt; for buses. Some of you folks seem to pull yours at
&gt; least that often. ;-)


Well, once you can get an engine to survive for an hour of operation, a
hundred hours isn't much more money or effort.  However, if you want to
have assurance that it will perform for 20 hours, you had better design
for at least 10 times that life.

Frankly, there are plenty of cheap off-the-shelf piston engines that will
do the job nicely, from Limbach aircraft engines (which look suspiciously
like a type IV) to type I conversions, to Briggs and Onan industrial
engines.  Yes, they have longer lives than specified, but why spend $$$
redesigning engines for less life?
