Wow, 4 or 5 people being active at night in one bus; makes for the locals
thinking there is an earthquake judging by the way the bus is jumping around
 :-)

Hi Mark,

 

We camp with 4 or 5 people sleeping in the bus.... At EB2005 at night

the windows steamed up even with an electric heater in the bus.

 

IIRC it's typical for most people to exhale about a pint of water

overnight. More if they're active. ;-P

&gt; We just cracked a window 1/2&quot; and put the buddy on the floor

&gt; between the

&gt; seats, heat rises, so my wife and I and baby Sofia stayed nice and

&gt; warm.

&gt; We did have problems with the water accumulation on the windows,

&gt; but that

&gt; was really a minor nuisance really.

 

 

Happy trails,
