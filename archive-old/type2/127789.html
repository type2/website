Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Swap Info?

&gt; Must be a West Coast thing.  I even get Eurovan/
&gt; Rialta drivers in town to
&gt; wave at me all the time.  Maybe I just look
&gt; friendlier than you. Who knows.
&gt; I do live in one of the friendliest cities in
&gt; America.  Charleston, SC.
 
  Snoopy,
  
  I'm thinking the same thing. Up here in Asheville
we all get along.
