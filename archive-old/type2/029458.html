&gt; Hi Chad
&gt; Sounds like something's acting like a check valve in the system.  If you had 
&gt; the same problem with both old and new flexi lines and wheel cylinders, the 
&gt; trouble's gotta be uphill from that.  I assume your left front works fine so 
&gt; I'd almost betcha the trouble is between the flexi line and the 'tee' where 
&gt; the front lines join (maybe at the master?).  I didn't look at your master 
&gt; cylinder so I can't say...

The flaw here is that the 68-70 master cylinder has seperate ports for
the front brakes. (look under the dor dave) and no tee in the front brake
system. Since he has eliminated the hose the problem will be the MC.
