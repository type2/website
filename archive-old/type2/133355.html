&gt; &gt; I have used 205/70R14 tires for many years but not goodyears (Michelins)

&gt; Another consideration is the fragile steering boxes in early Bay buses.  I
&gt; wouldn't put a wider than stock tire on a 68-72 bay because of the added
&gt; turning force required to steer when not moving.  Those boxes aren't
&gt; cheap!

true, my current bus is a 78, although I probably lucked out in years
past on my 71 and 65 which also had oversized tires
