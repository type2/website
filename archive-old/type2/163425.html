Subject: Re: [T2] RIGHT turn signal blows fuse

Answer to question 2:

Terminal 54BL exists only on Bay Windows thru 1971 (on the turn signal
switch) and is related to the switching of the Stop Light and the Turn
Signal Light circuits using the single tail/stop/turn bulb(s) in the rear.
The instruction is clearly for 68-71, but useless for 72-79 models.  This is
how the instruction for 72-79 Bay Windows should read and how I have tested
switches of this year period for over two decades:

Set your VOM to RX1K or RX2K.  Disconnect the Black/Green/White Wire from
the connector and attach to the + of the VOM.  Disconnect the Black/Green
(R) from the connector and attach to the - of the VOM.  Move the lever to
activate the RIGHT turn signals.  The VOM reading should go from 1K or 2K to
zero - a direct short indicating continuity to that circuit through the
switch.  Disconnect the Black/Green and then Connect the Black/White (L).
It should do the same when you move the lever to activate the LEFT turn
signals.  With the switch in the neutral position, there should be zero ohms
as well for either L or R circuit.  If there is any resistance (ohmage, for
lack of a better term,) in any of the switch's positions, it should be
replaced.

&gt; Problem: when RIGHT turn signal is activated, S12 fuse is blown.
&gt; Consequently, when hazard switch is activated, it's S8 fuse is blown.
&gt; LEFT turn signals, all lights, flasher relay, and hazard switch are all
&gt; functional, for sure. No wires are grounding out and ALL wires are intact
&gt; correctly and verified via Bentley.
&gt; With right exterior turn signals disconnected (black/green wire at the
&gt; source plug from turn signal switch) fuse still blows. So, it's not a wire
&gt; going to the turn signal bulbs or the bulbholders themselves.
&gt; Question 1) Does this sound like the problem is the turn signal switch?
&gt; Has anyone had the same experience and validated it by replacing the TS
&gt; switch?
&gt; Question 2) According to Bentley, in order to test the switch, you need to
&gt; verify continuity using terminal 54BL against L and R of TS switch.  Where
&gt; is 54BL? Ground? I verified L and R from TS switch against GROUND. When left
&gt; (good side) turn signal switch is activated, low ohmage. When right (bad
&gt; side) is activated, it spikes. Does this complete the test and verify that
&gt; the R of the TS switch is bad and TS switch must be replaced?
&gt; Thanks!  -Chris
