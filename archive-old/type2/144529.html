I just picked up some cap'n seats for my bus, and have two pairs of seats
I no longer need or have space for.  The original seats from my 78 are
shot.  They need full padding and so on.  The material is in pretty
decent shape.  The other set came out of a 83? vanagon and are in pretty
good shape.  The drivers seat is down right comfortable.  The other one
could use some back padding but is still pretty comfortable.  Pics of
said seats are available at http://radom_dot_org/outgoing/bus_seats/

seat 1 is the most comfortable from the vanagon, seat 2 the other
vanagon.

Here's a pic of the new setup.  They're so damn nice!  The covers are
only on because I fell in love with all the pockets when they were on the
vanagon seats.

Anyone suffering from bad seats could really benefit from the vanagon
seats I have.  They are comfortable.  The others will need some TLC
before they're usable.
