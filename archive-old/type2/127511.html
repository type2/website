&gt; I've used this method a number of times and found that it does cut down on

&gt; electrical problems so he converted it to 12 volt. In my opinion butt
&gt; connectors are the fix for the ignorant and usually compound the problem

Absolutely!  Crimp connectors work fine, as long as you have the factory
crimp machine to apply them.  This machine applies so much pressure that
the wire and connector are deformed into intmate contact and all voids
eliminated from the joint.  Take apart a 30-year-old VW crimp connector
and you'll see shiny copper wire inside.

We can't duplicate the factory crimp connectors with the crimp pliers
found at the local FLAPS.  These need solder to produce the &quot;forever&quot;
connection demanded by bus owners.  If you're doing this, you might as
well dispense with the butt connector entirely and solder the wires
directly.

Don't get me started on insulated crimp connectors!  :)
