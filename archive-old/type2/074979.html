Subject: Re: [T2] Heating possiblities

Has anyone thought about an oil-to-water heat exchanger? Cool your oil
while heating the bus? I know ac VW buses don't have any water in them
normally, but I've drawn out a plan for a dc-powered heat
exchanger/water pump setup, using dc solenoids to control the flow of
oil thru the system and allowing the exhausting of heat in summertime
when heat is not wanted in the cabin. It's dooable!

My .02 1/2.

Chris.
