Subject: Re: [T2] VW Bus jump...Will it ever stop????

From Patrick Ctti | Nimble Creativity:

Gezz...

Seems like some people are stressed out.. Or something... I simply ask a
question couple days ago.. And a guy told me.. NOT ANOTEHR TIRE QUESTION.. I wasn't upset but just..spooked
that this list have some poeple that dont  want to help or give useless info...

 New people every day are suscribing to this list and the question will come over and over again...

As for the list.. It's aswesome.. But the web site is hard (opnion here) to
navigate and to find info...Rather go to  &lt;outbind://47/www.rtwell_dot_com&gt;
www.rtwell_dot_com to find info.

Any how...

 For you guys that dont want to answer or are board of the jumping bus...  think you can keep your reply to
yourself...just dont reply...

No, as a newby and all other new people that sign on to this list, you got a email that stated the charter of
the type 2 list. You were asked to read it. If you had, you would have seen this section:
ETIQUETTE AND LIST CULTURE

The fourth paragraph down says:
&quot; --Search the List Archive and the Technical Resource Library.
In other words, consult the extensive resources available to
you at www.type2_dot_com before asking on the list. You will get more
information faster that way. If you ask frequently asked questions
(FAQs) or frequently annoying recurring threads (FARTS), people will be inclined to ignore you or become
caustic.&quot;

Guess what? You asked a FART question and you got a caustic answer.

Here is the whole charter. Read it.
http://www.type2_dot_com/type2charter.html

Go here and type in tires:
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/search-type2.html
Five easy letters and you get 4469 matches.
Wow, that was tough.....
