Subject: Break In Schedule on a Rebuild?

Found info on the archives that says:

&quot;Drive the vehicle at 2000 RPMs or less for 200 miles. Change the oil,
filter and clean the strainer. You can do the 200 miles in city driving
or better out on a country road but don't let the engine overheat sitting
in traffic. Race the engine up to 2000 RPMs if you get stuck in traffic,
you engines needs the airflow to keep the heat down.
Install 20/50-wt oil after this 200 mile run in.
Drive the vehicle another 600 to 800 miles keeping the engine at less
than 2000 RPMs and change the oil and filter again.
You should check your lifter setting at this time and check for any oil
leaks.
After you've got this break in done you should wait about 5000 to 8000
miles before you go onto the higher quality synthetic oils.&quot;

and this:

&quot;.._dot_using a good quality 10W-40 multi weight oil
for the first 1,000 miles do not drive at a constant speed and try not to
pull any really tough hills or overly high RPMs.&quot;

Some posts actually said NO break in at all is needed.  I will driving
the '79 rebuild appreximately 120 miles when I pick it tomorrow.
(Yeah! New 2.0!)  I plan on staying in the right lane and taking
mostly 2 lane roads back.

Any opinons on break in?  Thanks.
