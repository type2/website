Subject: Re: [T2] More starter problems

start by putting the parking brake on &amp; take the bus out of gear.
disconnect the primary coil wire (one from coil to distributor cap).
Take a wrench &amp; turn the alternator nut &amp; see if the engine turns. it
should, if not something else is amiss. If you can turn it by hand you
can count on a good starter being able to turn it.

&gt; Where exactly is the ground for the starter?  it is

&gt; wire that goes from the nose of the tranny to the body
&gt; of the bus.  the only other thing I can think of is
&gt; that the engine isn't moving, but that seems unlikely
&gt; since it was fine when I dropped it and only did some
&gt; clutch work.  I was thinking of pop-starting it and
&gt; see if that breaks the egine loose.  any thoughts of that.
