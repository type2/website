Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Leak

&gt;You might have to call around to the FLAPS but one of them should stock
&gt;phlorescent dye. Add some (follow directions on package) and get a black
&gt;light (Wow, man). Then, at night (unless you've got access to a dark ga-
&gt;rage), let the engine idle until you start to see the glow. Some oil leaks
&gt;are tough to pinpoint on VW engines because the fan keeps a constant
&gt;flow of air blowing the oil around...

FWIW I saw that Lowe's Hardware sells florescent black lights in the light 
bulb section at the bottom of the rack. I was busy hunting for the LAST 
3-way fluorescent bulb for a lamp we bought. I like using 10W and getting 
the same as 75W of incandescent bulb lighting.
