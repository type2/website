Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper replacement

Why would you think the new bumper is going to look ugly?
I get a kick out of some people's thinking that only original
looks nice.

I also like to think in the terms of functional.  Building a better
more functional bumper so that I can haul 4 kids mountain bikes
around so they can have fun. Or I can use the existing one which
isn't... or add a reciever under the already not functional bumper.

Why add extra weight when one will do?

I think there isn't nothing nicer looking than the stock bumper on the
back of a Bus---

The Garbage Truck Mack Bumper is a bit of an overkill, and isn't really
eye appealing.
