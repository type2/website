Subject: Pertronix ignitor

FYI,
  On 02/06/97 I purchased and installed the ignitor. On 09/11/98
it went south. Now here is what happened. I handcrafted (grin) a
new ground strap, the one inside the dizzy, as the old one was
in bad shape and was hangen on by a thread,,or 2. I ran it around
block and all seem fine. That evening, on my way to get my daughter
who was at a football game, Gunter started to surge and die. This
happend a couple of times then,,,nada. I coasted a bit into
the B.P. station. I couldnt get to it then as I had to arrange for my
kid
get picked up,,,and get a ride to work for myselfe,,geeez!
NEXT DAY:
  Stuck my points back in (carry them in the bus) and off she goes.
So it lasted 19 months,,,,I dont know if I did something to it
whilst messing about in there or it just died, but, I will try out the
return policy,,,if they send me  a new one I will go back to it as
the bus seems to like it better (when it works).....so Volks, keep
that extra set of points with you.
