Subject: Re: westy sink/frig cabinet for sale

- ----------
BTW, does anybody have any suggestions on a fair price for this???

&gt; 
&gt; A friend has given me a westy (presumeably) cabinet with frig, sink,
water
&gt; tank, and apparently all hardware to sell for him as he is netless. I
don't
&gt; own a westy, so please forgive my ignorance. I don't know what year it
came
&gt; from, but the cabinet is covered in a simulated woodgrain and the
&gt; &quot;flip-top&quot; that covers the sink is in a light woodgrain with a hint of
&gt; green. There's some led lights on the front of the cabinet too.
&gt; 
&gt; Please email any inquiries to me.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
