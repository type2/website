Subject: RE: [T2] Woodstock - VWs

Heh, I wouldn't know.. I wasn't born until 1978. More than likely, I would
have been the guy that showed up in the 1969 Pontiac GTO with the 455 Super
Duty.

Still, one of the aspects that makes the Bus so intriguing is the fact that
it was such an icon during the 60s with hippies and stuff.

With the Bus parked out in front of my fiancee's condo, everyone always
yells out to me &quot;Scooby Doo!!!&quot; (she has a dark brown Chessapeak Bay
Retriever), or someone will yell out &quot;PEACE, MAN!!&quot;.
