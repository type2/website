The 1600cc upright that I somehow managed to retrofit to my 72 Westy
(which came without an engine) gave up the ghost outside of Wellington
the other day.  So, I'm wondering what year of bus I should look for at
the junk yard to find a pancake that will work without too much
trouble.  The chances of finding a 72 here in my part of Kansas are
pretty slim, and since it donsn't have the computer and all, a fuel
injected one wouldn't work.  So, basicially, what year/model should I
look for?  Thanks!    Ray
