&gt; I think dan, of oceanstreet video will be there, again, and he usually has
a
&gt; big tent pushing all of his terrific videos, and that should be a good
&gt; central place to meet. (Sure hope he doesn't mind, Dan?) How about noon?

    sounds like a good idea to me! i should be right near the dkp tent again
this year, it's on the north end of the main vendor row, i.e., close to the
spectator entrance you drive into... all the dkp cars are on that end.

    the tent i'll probably be using is a white pitched-roof 10x20 with a
bunch of straw lifeguard hats hanging from it.

    i'm not sure when, but fred simpson will be there hanging out in the
booth, if you have performance tech questions about heads, this is the man
to ask.
