Subject: RE: [T2] Bus motor replacement

 &gt; When I went FI with a 1973 single-outlet tank I cut down a spare &gt;
passenger side fuel rail to make a pair of metal T fittings. One of &gt; which is
in my spares pile, the other has one end attached to the &gt; tank, one end
attached to the fuel filter, and the third end attached &gt; to the fuel return
line.&gt; &gt; It has been two years running without issue. All you need is a T, not
&gt; a tank swap.I second that emotion.  I had to put a return line on the Unimog
and tee'd in behind the fuel filter/pump.  No worries, and fuel pressure
varies pretty widely depending on boost with my system.
