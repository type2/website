Subject: RE: Parts list sent a couple of days ago

To all of you who responded to the sale of parts:

The middle-aged couple who purchased my 79 bus yesterday wanted that pile
of parts. I regret having to make that announcement to those of you
hoping to get items you need.

I sold the bus and the parts for nearly $4000. And the interest was
incredible. I only had my hand-painted sign up in the front yard for 6
hours -- and received several SERIOUS inquiries and a sale. And two
people are calling me tomorrow hoping that the sale didn't go through
yesterday so they can buy it.

To you who responded to the advertisement: Sincere apologies for not
being able to send you the items you needed.

Scott

                 I wish I were half the man I wish I were.
