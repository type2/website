Subject: Re: [T2] Future of the type IV engine?

Jeff,

You keep trying these guys(just call them!) lots of folks in Europe speak
better english than I do...&lt;grin&gt;

I have heard and read that in Europe, lots of the T1 guys have switched
to using T4 engines...they must be getting them some place?

I know it is a PITA, but I have found that when you want something done
right(like engine boring) you go to the folks with the best 
reputation....in your case it probably means some fo the folks on the west 
coast....the ones that do that job a lot and have their reputations on the 
line for each and every job.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Chuck:
&gt; 
&gt; I saw that add a while back, but I have had no luck contacting them at all. No
&gt; luck with email, fax or the phone. I even brushed up on my German to write my
&gt; questions. If anyone knows of a NOS CV/CU case for sale let me know as it is
&gt; worth $600 or more to me.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks anyway.
&gt; Regards,
