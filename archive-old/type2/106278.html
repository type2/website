Subject: RE: [T2] Cold-hot idle mystery

hi,

when cold, the valve is open.  i took it out an looked at it and the opening
in a slot in a plate.  the plate moves to close the valve when hot?  even
when cold, the valve is not open to a round hole, only to the slit in the
plate.  should this be totally open so you can see a round hole?

&gt; It sounds like the aux air valve may not be doing its job.  The aux air
&gt; valve is open when the engine is cold raising the idle a bit, sort of like
&gt; you were pressing down slightly on the gas.  When the engine warms up the
&gt; aux air valve closes down.
