Actually it says the opposite.

&quot;...FAT [Performance] starts with an inspected used case that is free of 
excessive wear and obvious problem areas. Since these cases are cast 
primarily out of stronger aluminum alloy with little or no magnesium, 
unlike the Type 1. Case cracks and crank tunnel wear requiring align boring 
are rare.&quot;

Speaking from experience I had my engine rebuilt a few years ago by my 
mechanic Gordi Davis. It was in my camper when I bought it in Tennesee and 
it was a Gex engine that had lasted less then 50K before it dropped a seat. 
He told if it was align bored like he thought it would be he would throw 
the case away. I think he is a little extreme, but he does nice work 
(though I get sick of hearing him disparage Brazilian parts as I can't 
always afford the German ones). Fortunately it wasn't align bored, the 
crank and case were OK and I just got new bearings, P&amp;Cs and Mark Stephens 
heads.

Thanks Jeff,

Does the Type 4 rebuilding article state that you have
to line bore the block?  If so does it say what
happens if a rebuild does not include line boring?
Thanks.

&gt; So per a request I got I made up a list of all the
&gt; articles I have in the
&gt; series from H*tVWs. That way if any of you have any
&gt; magazines your hiding
&gt; in your basement, and some of them are H*tVWs :),
&gt; you might find you have
&gt; them already...
&gt;
&gt; March 89: Canvas and Seal replacement on the pop-top
&gt; May 89: Adding a gauge package (Tach, head temp, oil
&gt; pressure, voltmeter)
&gt; June 89: Installing a 1907cc engine and Transform
&gt; &quot;Freeway Flyer&quot; tranny
&gt; Sept 89: Drilling rotors and drums for better
&gt; performance
&gt; Dec 89: Bodywork
&gt; Jan 90: Interior work, including recovering seats
&gt; and carpet
&gt; Feb 90: Stereo install
&gt; March 90: Sagging rear end and rear sway bar install
&gt;
&gt; I think I might have overlooked one or two because I
&gt; remember a sliding
&gt; door adjustment article I wanted to find for myself.
&gt; While I was poking
&gt; around I also came across some other articles...
&gt;
&gt; July 90: Type4 engine rebuild
&gt; Dec 90: One of my personal fantasy's a 5-speed
&gt; conversion to a bus tranny
&gt; with a 2.75&quot; extension between the tranny and
&gt; nosecone which gives enough
&gt; room for a rabbit 5th gear as low as 0.71. Cost was
&gt; $1500 (in 90) besides
&gt; the customization necessary to mount a tranny that
&gt; was now almost 3&quot; longer
&gt; then before.
&gt; June 95: Type4 valve seat replacement
&gt; July-Aug 95: Building a 2813cc Type4 at FAT
&gt; Performance
&gt;
&gt; As I post articles I will post URLs to them. Look
&gt; for the sagging rear
&gt; article this weekend.
