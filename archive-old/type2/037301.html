Subject: 1700 FI Flat Spot

It's Friday!!

Just 7 more hours of pure torture, and I'm out to the Thousand Trails in
Santa Barbara for a W/E or R&amp;R.

I have a ??? about a buddy of mines 1700 w/Jetronics (I think that's what he
said it had - I have never laid hands on a pancake motor, so forgive my
ignorance) F.I. He says it runs well, but has a noticeable flat spot at 3000
RPM. Once past 3K, it runs fine again. BTW - it's in a 914, but I was hoping
some sound advice would span the gap.

Thanks -
