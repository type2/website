Subject: Thank you all, leaving to go West

Dear List,  I am leaving the list to head out west for the summer.   I will
reconnect with you all if I happen to be near a computer of some sort.    I
want to thank you all immensely for all the help you have given me.  I hope
to find my vaccum leak at some point soon.  I was given some good
suggestions as to the source of this leak.  IF you see a beige '79 westy on
the road with Missouri plates its probably me.  I hope you all have a
wonderful summer, and keep those buses running.    Special thanks to Sean
Bartnick and all the others who had thoughtful responses to my questions.
much thanks
