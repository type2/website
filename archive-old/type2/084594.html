Most certainly verify the lube level in the tranny. Top it up if required. 
If dirty or milky looking, change it. If you take some lube and a suction 
gun and the 17mm hex for the filler plug, you can monitor for losses and 
not burn up your tranny, even on a long trip. This may well be a situation 
where you need to top up from time to time until your need a new clutch or 
otherwise must pull the engine. Then you can inspect and/or replace the 
input shaft seal with the best use of labor to kill 2 or more birds with 
one stone, so to speak.

Do be sure to use GL4 lube. Typically the right lube is marked GL3/GL4. Do 
not use lube marked GL4/GL5, or GL5 or GL6. They are too slick for the 
syncros and will wear them smooth so they won't grab and you can end up 
grinding your gears into gravel. Whole great big bunches of more info on 
tranny lube in the archives. It's one of the very important specs not to 
violate on a T-II.
