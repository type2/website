Subject: HUGE brake problems

Hey everyone.

Well it looks like my brakes are seriously messed. Nothing is really 
hooked up correctly, the hand brake levers/springs/pins are missing 
(the hand brake cable is there), and the stars dont move a bit. After 
some pounding I did mange to get the stars mount free from the 
backing plate and discover that it was bolted, pined and welded on 
there. I mostly removed it so I could get the stars loose to replace 
them. After some more inspection and research (looking at catalogs 
and Murr's book (Idiots)) it looks like I might have a bug back plate 
(maybe hubs and whatever else) and brakes on my 79 bus. Does anyone 
know if this is really possible? Does anyone have a pict of a good 
brake job they could send me so I know if what I have is at least 
close? How hard (I hear its really diffcult) is it to remove the hub 
and replace the whole thing, hubs, etc? My CV boots have worn away 
sometime ago and I figure I can just do it all if I have the hubs off 
for the brakes. If anyone wants to help I can send a photo of what 
they look like now.

thanks.
todd.
