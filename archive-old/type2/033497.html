hi chad,

I too was an automotive hypochondriac... i had rebuilt my own engine and
couldn't stand to drive my bus without hearing the engine.  Every odd
noise i heard was the death knell for my engine.  Every rattle knock or
tap convinced me my rods/mains were about  to go out and fry the engine.

As time passes and i gain more faith in my mechanical abilities i have
learned to trust my work and my maintnenance.  My engine runs cool, not to
cold , not overheated... so i trust it wont overheat enough that checking
the dipstick fo rheat whenever i stop is enough...  I have enough faith in
my work on teh bottom end of the engine that i dont think every rattle is
the end of the engine... (except for a couple of weeks ago i thought my
bumper bracket tapping on the exhaust was a rod knock, hehe)

So, in summary... When i didnt trust my work and my machine, i felt the
need to check all the time.  Now that i am a better mechanic and know my
bus better, i can relax and enjoy the ride much more.

peas,

Steve

p.s. when i try to sleep on the bed over the engine while moving.... all
my paranoia comes back as the engine sounds so different when i am right
over it that i cant really relax untill i get used to how it sounds back
there.  Takes me probably 10 minutes to breathe that sigh of relief and
get to my nap :)  i would sleep head forward, but i have a fear of an
accident propelling me head first toward the front of the bus.
