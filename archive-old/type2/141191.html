&gt; &gt; &gt; is it ok to use a beetle style muffler on a 70 bus?

&gt; &gt; Sure, if you want to risk dying from carbon monoxide poisoning.

Thanks for the input. I'll try the beetle muffler, since I have one. I'll
get a portable co detector also just in case, they're cheap. First sign of
CO I'll get a bus muffler.

Thanks.
