Subject: Ign. Switch replaced, now starter failing

The new ignition switch made for improved startups.  For a few days.

This morning all I got was a big &quot;clack&quot; from the solenoid.  I put the bus
in gear and rocked it forward and back a few times and it started.

Happened again at lunch (still getting the &quot;clack&quot;) and I had to push start
it.

I assume I may be looking at chasing down the whole ignition/starting
circuit now that I've thrown the new switch in there.

Thoughts? (76 bus w/ 79 CA engine)
