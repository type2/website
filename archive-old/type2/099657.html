Subject: Re: [T2] 110 V -&gt; 12 V, 2 amp = Battery Charger??

&gt;Local music store is going out of business and is selling a 110 Volt to 12 
&gt;Volt 2 amp converter for $3!!   I bought two.
&gt;
&gt;Can this be used as an overnight charger??  I mean, 2 amps is pretty 
&gt;significant, and I measured the output at 15.5 volts DC, more than the 
&gt;rated 12 volts.
&gt;
&gt;This beast weighs 1.5 kg so it is not economical to mail.   Anyone local 
&gt;who would like me to pick one up and hold it, the store closes Saturday, 
&gt;and things are going ...  Last night there was a dozen or so 
&gt;left....   Marcus, Tom, Andy, Steven (you always need another one), Jeff, 
&gt;'Joe'.....
&gt;
&gt;Comments on over charging, permanent installation, automatic shut offs, etc.

My motorcycle battery charger puts out 1 amp so you can surely charge a 
battery - slowly.

I think the main difference are these: the power supply is going to have 
cleaner power (no hum in the radio you plug in) and no circuit to taper off 
the output when the battery is full. In short it is a smaller version of 
what is under the back seat.

I would just keep or sell them to folks that work on 12 volt items like CBs 
or mobile ham equipment. I'd love to have one for those reasons alone.

What store went out of business?
