Hi Jaime,
&gt; Yeah, as a matter of fact, me and my macho homeys was hangin' (with
&gt; our bad selves) the other night debatin' how truly badass it would be
&gt; to start an Aerostar club!

 An Aerostar.. Hmm, what would that be then?

 Seems I'm the only one that thinks &quot;Vanagons&quot; will be sought after in a few years. Bizarre- there are lots of them around- I've seen quite a few already with body kits and alloy wheels etc.
 They may not have the same style as the older busses but that doesn't mean they don't appeal to anyone.
 Maybe they'll only be popular outside North America- UK, Germany, Holland, Denmark, Oz, South Africa, France, Belgium, Switzerland....

Cheers,
              W.
