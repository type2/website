well i got the ebrake cable out by just clamping on the vice grips and
pulling like hell.  it came free after about 10 seconds.  for the moment,
im just going to reassemble the brakes and leave off the cable and related
hardware inside the drum until i can find a replacement.  be an easy job
with a new cable.  do new ebrake cables come with the flexible rubber hose
installed?  mine was completely corroded and nasty.  i couldnt see how
anyone could replace the cable without replacing the hose.  or maybe im not
looking hard enough.  anybody out there know how this works?
