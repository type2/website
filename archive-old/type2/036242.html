&gt; Well,  I'm trying to get some more fuel economy out
&gt; of my 1970 Bus  - stock
&gt; 1600 single-port.
&gt; 
&gt; The timing seems spot on.  (Although I always feel a
&gt; little insecure about
&gt; the points gap - I do it to the best of my ability,
&gt; but I'd rather know that
&gt; the dwell-angle is right - it seems so much more
&gt; &quot;accurate&quot; 

Get a tach/dwell meter...they only cost about $20.00;
they do make a difference!

&gt;- I don't have a
&gt; strobe - I do mine statically - like Muir says -
&gt; with a home made light.)

I started out this way (using the static method), but
a mechanic friend showed me just how foolish it was!
I've since purchased a timing light and the bus runs
much better.

I've also used the static method, then re-checked it
with the timing light...it was way off!


&gt; 
&gt; I've readjusted the choke - it seems just right now
&gt; - always a bit trial and
&gt; error.  (I reckon Muir didn't have to cope with
&gt; chokes - 'cause he lived in
&gt; the toasty warm parts of the 'States.)

Muir hated chokes *vehemently*! In his book, he
recommends pulling them out and throwing them away.
This is one of the few areas where I've found Muir to
be totally wrong. Adjusting them is a PITA, but well
worth the effort on those cold mornings;-)

Of course, if I lived in sunny So-Cal, I might feel
differently.
