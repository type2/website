Subject: [T2] low valve pressure

Hi Volks,

While tuning up my '72, I noticed a rhythmic clicking resounding out of the
engine.  I pulled the sparkplug wires out and the sound remained more or
less, until I pulled #3.  The sound died.  It doesn't sound like like valve
chatter, something heavyer like a 'thuk thuk thuk' than a click.  I tested
the compression on #3 and got 88psi.  I squirted a little oil down the
cylnder (hopefully) and read the pressure again.  It was now at 90psi.  The
sparkplug was blackened with the usual soot, but looked fine otherwise.

The oilbath air filter unit was out of the engine, if that makes any
difference.

So:
there's the rhythmic thuking noise.
not firing #3 makes it go away
the compression on 3 is 88psi and only increases by 2psi with oil added.

Thoughts?

TIA

Landon
