&gt; Thanks again...I guess I shouldn't feel so bad about the
&gt; bus aerodynamics...My old Morgan comes in at 0.65 -
&gt; Winchester Cathedral at 0.64 ;-)

Actually, I understand that VW put considerable thought into the 
aerodynamics of the bus.  They were, after all, engineering a large 
frontal area box to be powered with the same 25hp as the bug (the bug 
has a high CD).  The CD had to be lowered considerably to get a decent 
top speed.  The CD of the bus is considerably better than that of the 
bug, but since the frontal area of the bus is greater the bus has more 
drag.

If you look at the front of your bus, you will see that it is really a 
blunted bullet shape, not a flat panel.  The key is to keep the 
airflow attached as it spills from the front of the bus to the sides, 
and to separate it cleanly at the rear of the bus.  

The bus does a pretty good job in the front, not so good at the rear.  
sharp corners would actually be better at the rear of the bus, but 
symmetry demanded rounded corners back there.

The Vanagon improved things at the rear, but worsened things at the 
front with its angular look.
