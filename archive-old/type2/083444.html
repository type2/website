Subject: Tires

The list hates this stuff, because it comes up so
often and people get emotional about it.  

Begin your search by reading the tire faqs

You are aware of the library on type2_dot_com, right?

Ignore all the 15&quot; stuff unless you are going to
pay lotsa bucks on larger wheels. 

But, as to sizes, 185r14 with the appropriate
load rating is stock (sort of).  195R14 is only
slightly taller.  Tires in 185R14 and 195R14 tend
to be commercial highway rib style with
appropriate (C or D load-rating).  Choices in
these tires include the super-pricey Michelin
Agilis, Yokohoma 356's (?), Cooper SRM (and twin
Mastercraft Courser RD), Bridgestone RD603, and 
I think Kumho is still importing some.  

205/70/14 is a passenger style tire that is about
the same circumference.  Some folks still have
the old michelin mx or mxt's in this size.  They
worked because they were reinforced tires.  I'm
not aware of anything comparable being available
now.  You probably won't find anything with an
appropriate load rating in this size.  

LT195/75/14 is also very close and may be had
with the proper load rating.  Most tire makers
offer something in this size, but many of the
tires labelled &quot;C&quot; load rating have only a 1450
rating at 50 psi and therefore less at lower
psi's.  Who knows what the minimum max load
should be, because our tech specs are written for
the tires of 30 years ago.  Some say 1500 lbs,
some say 1600.  Who knows but 1450 at 50 psi
means even less at 35-40 psi which is not really
better than a standard passenger tire.  

Some use oversized LT27x8.5 or 225/70/14 truck
tires.  Most manufacturers make these for jeeps
and such.  Most of these will have the
appropriate load rating.  Although the
225/70/14's rarely have LT rating, but have a
higher max load than many other load range &quot;C&quot;
tires.  

You mention wider tires.  Note that wider tires
mean more stress to your front suspension and
more difficult steering.  I did buy wider tires,
because I wanted a little more aggressive
off-road style tread, but I know they will wear
the suspension more.
