I bought the bus in 1990 and it had approximately 82,000 miles on it.


&gt; What I have seen from many years of working on these busses is the 
&gt; driving
&gt; habits of people will also play a large roll in how long the engines 
&gt; will
&gt; last.  The most important gauge a person can have in their air cooled
&gt; vehicle is a tach.  You should limit as much as possible not driving 
&gt; your
&gt; vehicle below 2,800 RPM or above 3,800 RPM.  Do not &quot;lug&quot; the vehicle 
&gt; around
&gt; town or on hills, shift down.
Yeah, I tend to agree with you.

&gt;
&gt; In this day and age where VW's are unique, most people were just not 
&gt; taught
&gt; how to drive them.  I'm not saying this is your problem, but I have 
&gt; seen
&gt; this many times.

I'm pretty aware.  I've owned an aircooled VW continuously since my 
first car, a '65 beetle that I bought used in 1975.  I've often thought 
that I knew a fair amount about these vehicles, but my head/valve 
problems of the last few years have left me humble.

So as far as my original question, does the broken advance spring 
resulting in excessive spark advance seem to be a legitimate 
explanation for the burned valves I've seen?

best regards

Tim
