Subject: the search for Mr. Bubblehead

Attention, please! I am having trouble with a VDO-Kienzle analog clock and have read an article in the tech section of type2_dot_com written (in part) by the one who goes as Mr. Bubblehead. If anyone (or the man hisself) can get me in touch with him, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!
