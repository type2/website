Subject: Re: [T2] How Hot is too Hot for Oil Temperature

It's not the oil temp that hurts the heads, it's the head temp.  Heads run
hot at lower RPM's but oil runs hot at higher RPM's, so by keeping the oil
cooler by slowing down, you may in fact be heating up the heads.  Keep those
RPMs between 2800 and 3800 to keep the heads cool.  If you are pulling a
trailer, climbing, or picking up speed, it's best to keep closer to the 3800
mark. 

&gt; I guess different engines will take different
&gt; temperatures, I sunk two valves on my 80 vanagon by
&gt; running the oil temp at and a little above 250F
&gt; degrees oil temp. I learned a good lesson, any temp
&gt; above 220F on mine I back off and slow down now, those
&gt; damn square port heads are high dollar.. Phil
