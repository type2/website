Hmmm. March can be a nice time in Baja, flower-wise. Can even be OK wave-wise
as winter wests aren't quite over and the odd southern hemi southwest could 
happen. A month of two later and things get real grim, surf-wise.

Bottom line for me is I have no time in March. Sorry Robert. Unless the Big One
hits Santa Barbara and shuts down the University, I won't be able to get away 
then.

Good luck,
Surfer Bob
