Subject: Pick and Pull report Woodland CA

Hi folks:

Finaly got into the local pick n pull, Merto Auto in Woodland to find 
parts for the F8rd truck I picked up for my business.

In the yard were three Vanagons and two Bays.  The Bays were both 
solid bodys but had been partially parted.  In the &quot;hold lot&quot; (10 
days left) was a 78 Westy automatic complete, with a few extra front 
seats from elsewhere in the yard.  A beetle or two as well and a 
wreck Vanagon might be only good for the motor.  Woodland is 10 
minutes north of Sacramento on Rt 5 Get off at the exit for the 
Sherrifs Detention Facility, take a left 1 mile on left.

Ben

PS Note my Westy didn't NEED any parts... &lt;g&gt;
