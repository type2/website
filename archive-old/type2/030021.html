First, I will be there!  I *hope* to leave here about 7 tomorrow and be
at/near Jeff's place by 8.  If things go fubar, look for a white splittie
at the intersection of 15 and 29, then look again in Opal.

Second, tho, and more important... If anyone coming has a ?50?-'70 and has
some spare lug bolts... I need 3.  We won't get into what kind of an idiot
would fail to check the tightness, but I need three.  If that's the worst
thing that happens on this trip, I will be pleased as punch! :-)

Sean and I *should* be travelling together, so look for his bus too!
