Subject: Re: [T2] Too many questions?

Not for me. I'm living vicariously thru all your questions. You bring up
scenarios that I haven't thought about, and the list comes up with
solutions, which is what the list is all about. And when our buses were
built and sold, they were built to be driven anywhere, and at any time. So
what if a few years have happened since they were built, the dependability
can still be there. Keep the questions and the updates coming, 'cause I'm
sure there's a lot of us contemplating doing just what you're doing.

&gt; I get the sense that maybe I'm asking too many questions.
&gt; 
&gt; But consider the aim: I want a bus in my driveway that I could climb
&gt; into on a moment's notice and drive from San Diego to Bar Harbor, Maine
&gt; and back with just an oil change in Bar Harbor. No &quot;can it make it?&quot; No
&gt; calls on AIRS. Just driving, looking at the scenery, and listening to
&gt; Allman Brothers on my iTunes.
&gt; 
&gt; And if I can do it, anybody can do it.
