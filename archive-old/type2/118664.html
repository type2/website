Subject: Re: [T2] What type of engine is this?

&gt; During my regular perusing of the ads on everyone's favorite auction site, I
 came across this one and would like to know what kind of motor is in this
 thing.  Is that a radiator cap in the bottom left hand corner?  Here is the
 link:

The ad says 2.0L air-cooled..... no way, no how!
It looks like a 1.9 Subaru engine.
