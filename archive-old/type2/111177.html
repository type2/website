Subject: stuck sunroof

The slider roof quit... I fixed it.. it quit again.
Got replacement cables as the reason it doesnt work
is that the cable kinked up at the handle when the
plastic cover/guide worked loose.
Sooooo the only way to get at the hardware is to
retract the roof a bit and pop the panel off and slide
it
out of the way.
  The problem is, it is at this point, stuck in the
closed
postion (which is good in a way).
  If I pull the hand crank hardware and push it back
will it slide without destroying anything? Anyone?
I know in order to install the new cable assembly I
have to pull the whole sunroof out an all that but I
havent worked
up the resolve to just force the damn thing back by
hand
as I am afraid I'll hose it up worse. Yes I searched
the
archives.
  I love my sunroof but it can be a PITA!

TIA
