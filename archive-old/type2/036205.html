Subject: More Dogleg Welding

Hello All,
    I feel like I've been run over by a truck. I spent most of today welding 
in the entire dogleg section on the drivers side. If you're not an 
experienced welder (I'm not) take a job like this to a professional. I wish I 
had. I would not begrudge a pro a significant chunk of change to do this job: 
it's not easy. If yours has solid rust free doglegs, cherish them. Check them 
weekly for signs of rust. If you find any, get rid if it now. This is not 
something you want to deal with. I didn't get to finish because my mig welder 
 started to sputter and spit- out of gas, so tomorrow at lunch its off to get 
the gas bottle filled. Actually, I'm glad it ran out when it did, because 
even though I would have continued to work, I was too tired to do a good job. 
Take care, Jeff S.

PS- go check those doglegs for rust-now!
