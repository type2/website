Subject: Finding TDC

I'm having trouble finding TDC on cylinder no. 1.  After pulling the plug,
you turn over the engine and using a finger feel for compression buildup
right ?!  Then you continue to turn the engine until the notch in the
crakkshaft pulley is in line with the 0 mark on tyhe timing scale.  My
problem is that I can't find the notch on the pulley.  Is this normal??
Does anyone know of a way to find TDC without using the notch.  Maybe its
there, but I sure can't see or feel it!

My 1981 Westy with a 2.0 l FI engine has a convenctional ignition system.
I was told my a local mechanic that the general rule of thumb for your
distributor cap wiring is to have the number 1 Ht lead segment in the cap
should point towards the number 1 cylinder.  My number 1 lead points
towards the rear of the engine compartment.  Can this be right?

As far as I can see, not being well versed in mechanics, the distributor
rotor button should point towards No 1 HT lead on the cap (with the metal
part of the button pointing in this direction) and the other side of the
button should point towards the notch in the rim of the distributor body.
Mine doesn't!!  

Any advice about setting TDC on No 1 cylinder and adjusting the distributor
would be greatly appreciated.  BTW, the engine won't start so I am thinking
that the timing could be way off!!
