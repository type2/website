Subject: Electrical Issues

Greetings again,

I just swaped a dash and fuse box on my 78 project from my 79. Sadly when I 
took out the wires from the 79 I was working in a back of a cold, dark 
storage unit and did not realize that there are plugs in the steering 
column. I cut the wire harness.  Without splicing I carefully combined the 
two. It took hours. Belive me I won't do that again.  I'm just glad the wire 
colors were the same between the years. I told myself it would be a miricale 
if everything worked. Most everything is working great despite my limited 
electrical knowhow.

Here are the issues:

My right turn signals are blinking fast. I've had this before when they were 
not grounded at the headlight bucket or when the fuse is bad but everything 
looks ok.  However the right rear sidemarker light is not lighting up. I 
don't think these are connected 'cause I have rarely had sidemarker lights 
work in the past...

Also My gas gauge skyrockets way past full when I turn the key when I know 
there is only 2 gal of gas in the tank. I had the tank out and replaced the 
sender. Checked resistance before the install. All was good. Could this be 
something else? Like a ground wire?? Did I swap the wires on the sender? I 
have a sender access door.

Many thanks,
Brandt
