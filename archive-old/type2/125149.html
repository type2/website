Subject: Body Piece removal question. 

I don't have a clue what to call the pieces I'm trying to remove. I want
to remove them to sandblast and repaint them btw, VERY rusty, but not
cancerous. I'll try to describe the piece. 
 
It's horizontal and about halfway up the bus, right below the window(s).
Only in the rear half of the bus. You know how the bus (mines a '76) has
that little bulge running down the side, on both sides? The bump that is
the place for the color change between the top and the bottom.  And on
the passenger side, it hides the sliding door tracking thing. It has two
screws that I can find. One in the front, one in the rear. I took these
screws out, but something is still holding it tight. 
 
Is their a trick to removing it? Like Push up, or Pull down, or
anything? Or is it spot welded on or something like that? And WTF do
they have it on the driver side too, where they don't need it to hide
the sliding door thingie? 
 
Hope that made at least SOME sense.
