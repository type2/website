Subject: Double cab and splittie for sale in Or

Hey Y'all,
  I was in the Salem Oregon area this week and ran across two Busses 
that I thought you all wouold like to know about. The first is a early 
70's Double cab. I have not seen it but was told that it is in realy 
nice unrestored condition. I don't know the year but was told that its a 
early 70's and all of the parts including the bed sides are there and 
good. They want $2500. The place that has the Bus is Autocraft in Salem 
Oregon. I can get the number if you want it. Or call information and 
then ask for Bruce, he is the owner.
  The other is a mid 60's splittie Bus that is in bad shape but could be 
restored or used for parts. It has a lot of rust in the lower body and 
is missing a lot of stuff like the engine and seats, most of the outside 
trim and the speedo are gone. This is a really big prodject and maybe 
beyond hope but the price was quoted as $300 and dropping. So If someone 
waved a crisp $100 bill they would most likely take home a Bus.
  I have no connection to either Bus or owner and recieve nothing from 
there sale. I just love Busses and would like to see them go to a loving 
home, my home has no more room. Drop me a line and I will tell you what 
I can about the busses and how to contact the owners.
