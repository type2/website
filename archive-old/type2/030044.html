I've used just about every variation of fridge and chest available.  I
like 3-way refrigerators in full motorhomes, but the miniscule ones in VWs
just don't hold much.  

Vertical iceboxes are the worst, since every time
you open the door all the cold air in the box dumps out and the insulation
isn't very good.

For my bus, I finally settled on a good 'ol metal Thermos ice chest.  I
rattle-can painted it all white so the sun won't heat it.  While
travelling, I drape a damp towel over it (use the melt water from the
chest to dampen the towel) for some evaporative cooling.  A 10 pound block
of ice lasts for two or three days depending upon how often the box is
opened and the outside temperature.

One big advantage to a chest is that it can be removed from the bus and
placed in the shade outside so it isn't exposed to high interior
temperatures.  It also serves as a 8th seat on the odd occasions that
I've had to carry 8 people.
