Subject: Re: [T2] odd bus sighting, AIRS question

Yeah, that's a real bus.  It's painted a deep red, and I believe lives
somewhere around Lockport, NY, but i can't be sure.  I've seen it too,
driving by, but I've never talked to the guy.

&gt; Being Friday and all, I though I'd ask about a bus my father saw on
&gt; the NYS thruway a few weeks ago and told me about.  It is a bay window
&gt; with a the top 1/2 of a bug body welded to the roof, facing backwards.
&gt; This is the best  I can get from my father so details could be wrong.
&gt; It was south of Albany but north of NYC, I'd  guess closer to Albany.
&gt;
&gt; Anybody confirm that my father isn't crazy, and know whose bus this
&gt; is? I'd love to see a picture.
&gt;
&gt; On an different note, I wonder if there is a way to link up the
&gt; westfalia_dot_org roll call that others have mentioned that list folks who
&gt; are willing to provide travelers with various services, with AIRS.
&gt; They offer similar services and folks should be aware of both.
&gt;
&gt; Hope y'all have a trouble free trip to and from BBTA. Should be huge
&gt; this year.  Bring your electric fans if you have electric hookup.
&gt; Last year there was electric hookup, and it will be a hot weekend!
