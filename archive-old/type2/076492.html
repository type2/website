Subject: Shift plate? (was Front Shift Rod Bushing Replace)

&gt;&gt;I got tired of the hard shifting and excessive rattle in the shift lever,
and did the same, noting that the rear bushings were gone but I didn't want
to pull the rod.  Shifting improved, no more rattles, and I suspect your
shifting may be worse if you did not get that little plate under the shift
lever in the right place to allow 1,2, reverse gear vs 3,4?&lt;&lt;

Seems like every response to my idea of replacing the front shift rod
bushing has mentioned the shifting being worse rather than better.  Could
all this be related to the &quot;little plate&quot; you speak of?  I've always known
of a plate down there of some kind and have always wondered if I am missing
something like, as I have never - since I've owned my bus - had to push down
while shifting into reverse; always just a smooth horizontal pull to the
left and smoothly down.  I just always thought I was lucky not to have to
deal with it.  Is this something I really need?
