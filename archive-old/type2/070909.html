&gt;  I'm trying to remove my muffler.  I'm going to put in J-tubes once I get
&gt;  the darn thing off!!  Anyone know how to get a muffler off with the
&gt;  engine in on a 71??  It is a major PITA!
&gt;  I would really love for someone to give advice!  I looked in Muir
&gt;  archives etc...  I want to know how to physically reach the stuff and
&gt;  actually do it.....
&gt;  would it be better to drop the engine?? YIKES!! scary stuff!

Hi Isaiah,

It sounds like your next investment should be a good workshop manual eg 
Bently or Haynes.

So for a 71 with type 1 engine....

&gt;from inside the engine compartment remove the little bits of tin at each end 
of the input manfold preheat pipe

Undo the four bolts (two each side) just revealed which hold the preheat pipe 
onto the exhaust. 10mm spanner

underneath the van remove the clamps that hold the heat exchangers onto the 
muffler (often rusted up so easiest removal is to hacksaw through the bolts) 
10mm spanner

Undo the 4 nuts (2 each side) the hold the muffler onto the heads at the #2 
and #4 exhaust ports. 13mm spanner

pull exhaust straight back.

refitting is the reverse of above, use new gaskets, and clamps. 
Fit the heat exchanger to muffler 'washer' and asbestos ring FIRST. 
Then put the muffler on the exhaust port studs with heat exchanger pipes 
connected.
Then put on the 4 exhaust port nuts and 4 heat riser bolts, but don't do 
anything up tight untill all 8 are in as the fit is unlikely to be perfect.
Last fit the heat exchanger clamps.

Good luck
