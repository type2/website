Maybe it's because the new motor is fresher, therefore more powerful than the old motor?
Same clutch, but more power (strictly, torque) means that it will slip where before you
never noticed. If new, it could have been faulty, or got oil on from the old engine (or
perhaps during fitting? You did wash your hands in-between jobs?).
