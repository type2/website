Subject: Re: [T2] VW Haven/Commune (interesting idea to think about)

I would live there. Like an idealistic Smurf utopia
built for VW enthusiasts. Reminds me of Everybus this
last year. If only we could make it last for more than
just a weekend! Heck, even a VW campground and park
catered specifically for our busses that was opened
year round would be nice.

Sounds like Heaven to me!

 we wanted

&gt; and trees, but with
&gt; some level areas for buildings), we would build
&gt; several houses near each
&gt; other, but far enough away to have more room than
&gt; your average
&gt; neighborhood. along with these houses (extra houses
&gt; built as more people
&gt; jin our community) we would build a large shop for
&gt; working on cars, a
&gt; paint booth, body shop, upholstery shop and a club
&gt; house for gathering to
&gt; watch movies or have parties. i thought it would
&gt; also be cool to have a
&gt; baja track circling the property......
