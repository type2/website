Subject: more 009 timing questions - need some help

I have done a thorough archive search and library read and can't yet come
to figure out how to time my 1600 dp with a 009. 

I am new to this engine...and to timing in general...so bear with me...my
vac advance on the stock 050 distributor was shot, so I had to drop in a
009. I have marked on my crank pulley the TDC dimple from the factory,
there is the factory notch to the left of the dimple (5 deg ATDC), and I
marked in what is roughly 24 degrees BTDC (to the right of the factory TDC
dimple). 

Took off carb, cleaned thoroughly (with some help...), rebuilt. Did not
change main jet size (currently 125) and did not put a pop rivet in the
throttle plate (as per library article - Boston Engines - on 009 timing). 

Set the timing at idle to about 2.5 degrees ATDC. I am not sure why we did
this. I think I thought we were setting it somewhere else. When the engine
is revved up, it advances to the 24 degree mark (right on the case split). 

It idles fine, runs very strongly (too strongly??), etc. etc. Runs better
than it ever has. It's a little dead off the line, but this could be a 009
issue (no vac off idle) and the small main jets. I think.

I am worried that we've advanced the spark too much and may overheat...but
at revs, it only advances to the mark we made at 24 degrees past TDC. It
was at idle sitting at about 3 degrees BTDC, so I am guessing that sits it
at 27 degrees total advance. 

Does this sound correct? 

Please help! I need to leave on a 3 week trip soon and do NOT want to kill
a newly rebuilt engine. I don't have pressure or temp guages. 

thanks 
dc
