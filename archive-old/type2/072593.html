Subject: swivel foot adjusters

I'm rebuilding a 1776  for my '71 Westy.  Last year, when I first did a
rebuild on this engine, I installed Berg heads and Berg swivel foot
adjusters on the rocker arms.  Last week, with the engine on the test
stand, I was adjusting the last of the eight valves when the adjuster
sheared in  half as I was tightening the nut.

I had a list  of parts  to order from RMMW so I added swivel foot adjusters
to that list.  They arrived today.

The design of the RMMW adjusters is fundamentally different from that of
the Berg version.  The Berg has the &quot;elephant's foot&quot; design;  the RMMW is
a small swiveling foot embedded in a housing.

I have a decision.  Replace all eight with the new RMMW ones or place
another order with Berg and wait another week.

Is anyone acquainted with the two types?  Is there any experience out there
which favors one over the other?

Jack
