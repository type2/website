Subject: Re: Oil Cooler Adapter...

&gt; The next option would be to install some right angle fittings on the
&gt; adapter so that the fittings would point down. This has some appeal,
&gt; but I worry about being able to turn the hoses quick enough so that
&gt; they wont scrape on the ground going over a speedbump or something,
&gt; and yet won't be crimped.

  &lt;snip&gt;

&gt; My thought is to try the second option first, and then go for the
&gt; third if I can not make it work, but I thought I would see what you
&gt; volks thought before I procede? Anybody out there install one of these
&gt; on a type 4 before?

I agree with your assessment.   I'd go with option #2, and even go
as far as fashioning a guard out of lightweight tin or plastic (from
an old milk jug or laundry detergent jug) so that if you're scraping,
the guard is going to hit first, letting you know that it's hitting (you'll
hopefully hear it) and taking some of the damage before your pipe fittings
or hoses do.  In fact, I'd argue for something heavier duty than plastic,
as the last thing you want is to run over a road hazard and have it kill
your hose/fitting, of which you don't have a spare and isn't a stock part.
That's probably just me being anal though.  :)

The other concern I would have is the increased drag on your oil as a result
of the additional pipe fittings and hoses.  I would wager that with just
the oil cooler and adaptor, you might be ok, but as you start adding in
more pipe-fittings, etc., you're getting farther away from what your
oil pump was spec'd to.  So that said, you might want to think about a 
slightly larger oil-pump if you intend (which I know you probably don't)
to pull your engine at any point in the near future.  Again, I don't know
much about the T-IV engines, and I'm just coming from an over-glorified
plumber's perspective, not that of an engine builder.  Maybe someone with
more experience building T-IV's will weigh in here...
