Subject: [T2]child seats and child comfort

In response to something offlist:

No this isn't saying you cannot be sued for
adding seatbelts.  You know that no one could
ever tell you that.  You can be sued for anything
and everything you do and don't do.  Some
attorneys out there will roll the dice on almost
anything.  

But you can be sued for not adding seatbelts too,
especially since the reinforced mounting areas
are there and you know they are.

You can be sued for driving a vehicle that is
inherently too dangerous to carry passengers ro
to be on the road.  Ralph Nader will appear, by
way of his book, as the expert witness.  This
happens to Jeep, Suzuki, and conversion van
owners every day.  Just by driving a converted
vehicle (whether converted by you, by Westfalia,
by Riviera or who ever) you are at higher risk
than the guy that drives a stock Corolla. 

You can be sued for not buying a 5 star rated
Windstar or something.  

You can be sued for driving too fast... to
slow... for not having the correct tires... for
not having bumpers... for not having upgraded
bumpers... for not adding an airbag... for not
having new ball joints and tie rod ends... for
having a quick shifter... for playing music or
talking on the cell phone while driving... for
driving while being distracted by personal
matters... 

You get the point.

But any suit ultimately lands in front of a jury,
lay people like you and everyone else in the
community.  And you can explain that you
preferred to leave the vehicle as is and allow
the kids to be ejected out the windows or that
you used the proper grade bolts and hardware
(stock bolts hardware) and bolted in a set of
belts.  I know which I'd prefer and I know that
my kids aren't getting ejected.
