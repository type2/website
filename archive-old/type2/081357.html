&gt; My Friends,
&gt;
&gt; I have this non-stock header on my '70 loaf, and the muffler component
&gt; is shot.  I've been searching high and low for a replacement muffler to
&gt; no avail.  It seems that the flange where the muffler connects to the
&gt; header is triangular with the point on the top, and a flat bottom.  All
&gt; the replacement mufflers I've found have a triangular flange that looks
&gt; like it's pointing to the left with the flat on the right side.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have a suggestion (or even know what I'm talking about)?  How can
&gt; I identify the header I have?  Where would I find a replacement muffler
&gt; for this header?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;

I had this very same problem, in fact the header and muffler were sent
as a package from the same vendor. The muffler is a Bug Pack, but I
have no idea who made the header. Since this was the last part needed
to get me on the road, and I was not interested in waiting for another
shipment, I cut the flange off the muffler, turned it and welded it back on.
If you are not capable of this operation I would think that a local
muffler shop or mechanic would do it for 10 or 20 bucks.
