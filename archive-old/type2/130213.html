Subject: Buses with watercooled engines

Okay, both George and David have replied with perfectly good reasons 
for making these conversions. I suspect their arguments make bus 
ownership seem more rational than it is or ever will be, no matter what 
conversions you make to them, but I'll pass on debating that.

I don't however think I am being intolerant by objecting in principle 
to engine conversions. I tolerate millions of watercooled vehicles on 
the highways, and even have two of them myself.

VW buses are different from other vehicles because, well, they are 
different. They represent an alternative solution of how to use 
internal combustion to move people and objects from point A to point B. 
They are, I think that most of us can agree, not the ideal solution. 
But they represent an interesting combination of compromises that exist 
in no other vehicle on the road. And they stand as an alternative to 
the standard way of doing things.

Aircooled buses make the world a richer, more diverse place. Buses say 
loudly that &quot;there is no one right way&quot; to make a vehicle, and they do 
that (again, IMHO) better than any other vehicle on the road.

Maybe it's okay if George converts his bus, and David does, and then 
Don does. But I rue the day that some newbie signs onto this list and 
the consensus of advice is: go out and get a conversion kit and a 
Suburu engine.
