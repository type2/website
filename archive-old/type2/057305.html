&gt; Gee, that's a bummer. I only just started reading them, and found
&gt; some really interesting information there. Bob, if you're reading this,
&gt; I urge you to reconsider. Or, as someone else suggested, burn them onto
&gt; a CD -- I'd buy one. Although the web version, which can be constantly
&gt; updated, not to mention available to a lot more people, is probably the
&gt; best venue.

Sign me up for a copy Mr. Hoover!  I would be grateful to purchase a copy of
VW/Bus internet HISTORY!

A retail truism states: &quot;one satisfied customer may tell three people but one
dissatisfied customer will tell at least ten&quot;  Such is the sad truth of human
nature.  Please Forgive us Bob! for our shameful silence of our appreciation
for all you've done to enlighten those of us who are ignorant but not stupid.

Ignorance is the lack of knowledge, Stupidity is ignoring that knowledge when
it is made available.

THANK YOU for all you've done Bob....
