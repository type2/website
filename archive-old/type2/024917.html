The type IV sounds like the type III squareback I use to have.  The bellows 
connects the cooling fan intake to the ductwork in the body that draws 
cooling air in through the external grills on the rear fenders.

&lt;&lt; Tricky question (?)  ;-)  ...
 
 I have seen this part...  but I do not know where it gets its air from...
 
 Anyone?

 &gt;                       I was browsing a 411/412 repair manual at the local 
 &gt;used book shop and
 &gt;noticed an apparently rubber bellows attachment to the fan on the motor. 
 &gt;Anyone know/have a 411/412 and know where this bellows takes air from?
