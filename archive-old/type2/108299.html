Kevin,
Your a little further along than me, but I have bought clips and rubbers to
fit a beetle. They are available, and not too expensive. They are the same as
original for the Kombi, just a little bigger. What I plan to do is open the
original holes a little and use the bug clips.
Cheers,
Richard
