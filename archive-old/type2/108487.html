Subject: Re: [T2] Sealing the engine tin...

&gt; does anyone know a  source, other than a junkyard (Tried that... the ones I have contacted 
 say that seems to be the first part lost, and there are not many of 
 them around...) for the little black plastic access door that plugs the 
 tin over the generator bolt on a '73 Westie?
 
I find them at the wrecking yards here. I have a couple of extras now....

I also have 2 pairs of the the channel covers for the type 4 heater boxes if anyone needs them.

Left and right are different. I will split up the pairs if you only want one.....
