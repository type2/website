Subject: Re: [T2] Re: tightening rims/ wheels coming off

Anti seize on the threads is a good idea.
I've done this as preventive maintenance for 30 years, and never lost a
wheel, but saved my back when it comes time to change / rotate the
tires.

The anti-anti seize / grease story is an old wives tale.--:&gt;)


Later,

Hmmm- 80 ft lbs - I gotta stand on the sliding handle to get off the
nuts sometimes- a lot must be too tight (of course there is friction
involved here- who greases their lug nuts)? I don't stand on them to
tighten, but do give it an &quot;umphhh pull/push until I hear that &quot;creak&quot;.
So a 16&quot; grab on a sliding handle needs at least 60 lbs of &quot;umphh&quot;
applied. If you pull up that's like picking up a bag of cement- ok for
those with good backs- others, I'd say make sure you are setting to pull
down and even step on it if you only weigh 110 lbs! I never let them use
an air tool on installing rims BTW, I specify hand tightening and check
it myself.
