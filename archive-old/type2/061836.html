Subject: re: guy living in has broken down bus

Friday - time ta ramble - ahha

I like to wish the list a merry Christmas and a happy new year - I do
hope that everyone got at least one nice bus related gift :)

And I would like to particularly wish all those patient  people who
administer the lists - it must get a little frustrating sometimes -
dealing with the bickering and non-bus related stuff that seems to get
posted by people such as me - thanks George, Thom, Steve, Ken, Stephen
and everyone else to spends so much of their precious free time helping
us to keep our busses on the road.

And Merry Christmas Bob Hoover - I am sure that underneath that crusty
exterior is a very well meaning and good person who wishes the best for
everyone.  I can only hope that I can help a small fraction of the
people he has helped in his life.  And I love your writing - I really do
have to order that CD soon.

I do hope that we, or at least those of us who are interested, are kept
informed as to the progress that is made re: the guy living in his
broken down bus.  Seems that this is a list made up of pretty unselfish
people who are very anxious to help each other and people in general -
probably has something to do with the type of person who gets into old
busses to begin with.  I mean - how pretentious can a person who drives
an old bus be?

Merry Christmas All
