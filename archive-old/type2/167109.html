HI All

I just got back to my email. Thanks for all the suggestions.  I forgot to 
give my year, I have a 1980 manual trans air cooled Westfalia.  I've written 
down all the suggestions and am going to check them out.  The Highway Patrol 
called today to see me tommorrow so if none of these locations work for my 
year, I guess Ill have the answer tomorrow.  And yes, I think DMV is getting 
a bit ridiculous, especially since the van was originally from California 
and the Smog Technician told me I was still in the state database.

Oh well , thanks for all the help.

Cheers,
Janyce
