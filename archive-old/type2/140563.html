Subject: I have started

Hello list, I have been reading the posts and checking out the archives for a
couple of years now.  (Don, I am glad that you didn't get rid of your bus
during a difficult time.)  Over the next couple of years I will remember.

I have a '79 westfalia, was a daily driver since we bought it in 92.  It is
now off the road, and I am currently stripping the interior, started
yesterday. ( I took a bodywork course for hobbyists).  I plan on fully
restoring &quot;kermit&quot;.

Apart from any helpful hints the list may be able to add, I have a couple of
concerns.

#1 the van was rolled before we bought it and sits slightly askew.  Handling
and tire wear are normal as is braking.  What do I do to correct the level?

#2  This is a 2ish year project, unfortuantely I don't have the most optimal
of workspaces, (it is covered though)  As the bodywork is being completed and
before painting, what can I do to prevent the &quot;new&quot; work from rust etc?  I am
not planning on doing the painting myself, and kermit will be completly
stripped out for the painting.

I see that there are a couple of list members from the Victoria area, see you
at Volksfest on the 10th, I myself am from Salt Spring Island
