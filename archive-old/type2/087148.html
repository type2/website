Subject: Re: [T2] High temp. paints

Brown,

I painted my 67 stock muffler with it about 2 years ago after sand 
blasting it(it was new).

Generally, It still looks pretty good, but follow the directions 
closely...I think I got my paint on too thick.  I have some streaks
that are starting to look rusty.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Has anyone tried any of the high temp paints from POR15 on exhaust
&gt; components?  I just received a used exhaust from Joe at BUStedBUS_dot_com and I
&gt; am thinking of hitting it with a coat of the &quot;Factory Manifold Grey&quot; or the
&gt; &quot;POR 20&quot; before installation.  Both are listed as withstanding temps up to
&gt; 1400F.  I have tried other methods such as grill/stove paint in the past to
&gt; prevent surface rust, and have never been very happy with the results.
&gt; Please let me know if you have any first hand experience, be it good or bad.
