Subject: Come one, come all !


Come one, come all !
    The Bus Alliance invites you all to the second annual LiMBO On Long
Island this coming weekend, June 7th to 9th.
For more info go to http://arasso.tripod_dot_com/limbo/  Last year, the first
time for our event, saw 26 buses from 6 different states.  Why not add yours
to the count this year?   Don't want to deal with the traffic going though
New York city, you say?  Well then go to the web site and check out the
details on how to get to our little island by ferry boat.  One of them is an
hour ride and the other is an hour and 20 minutes.  Either one makes for a
pleasant interruption to your drive to get here, just make sure to have a
reservation with the ferry company to prevent waiting.
I hope to see you there!
