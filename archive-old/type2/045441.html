&gt; &gt; &gt; I just removed the auxiliary aire regulator (valve?) from my 78 EFI.
&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a small rubber elbow attached to it, about half an inch in
&gt; &gt; &gt; diameter.
&gt;
&gt; I have been looking for this for several weeks as mine is taped and still
&gt; holding together. Bus Depot didn't have it in stock on my last order. If
&gt; anyone finds a source please let the list know.
