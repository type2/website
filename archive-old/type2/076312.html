Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [[T2] Transporter Back Alive/ Thanks]

I am glad to hear it.
I can relate with Clark. I have had my 74 automatic
bus since the summer of 98 and I have never driven it
past my front lawn. I am now in the process of tearing
down my engine to inspect, clean, adjust, retorque
relube, and replace worn parts. I am about 1/2 way
through with the bodywork. It is hard to find time and
money to spend on it, with me being a college student
who can only work about 18 hours a week. I am not
giving up! I just think about the work that I have
already completed, the work I will do to a certain
area and how it will come together. I try not to think
about the vast amounts of work that I have left to do
and redo. My goal is, when I move out of my parents’
house, I will move out in my completed bus. Just
imagine yourself driving in your finished project.
Imagine the feeling of a job well done. I wish
everyone good luck with their drivable busses and with
the busses that will one day be road worthy. 

Happy Holidays!

&gt; Great, man.
&gt; I've been on the list about three years.
&gt; When i tore into the 74 bus i used to have, the only
&gt; thing that got me through
&gt; was repeatedly coming back to the list and reading
&gt; about these busses and the
&gt; people who drive them.
&gt; I never would have finished if it weren't for this
&gt; bunch and their passion for
&gt; the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to the list and to the admins.
