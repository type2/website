Subject: Finally! A longish drive!!!

A few months ago I thought I was going to be able to drive my bus to
San Diego for a week-long training session. Things changed, and I
ended up driving the Volvo (and blowing a seal on the tranny too). But
I didn't feel the bus was up for the drive. But he is now!

This Sunday, I'll be carabussing to Oceanside from Anaheim (actually
meeting up in Irvine) to go to the JBugs / Strictly Vintage 2s
Autofest.

Flyer link: http://www.sv2s_dot_com/docs/autofestflier.pdf

It'll be the first long run Great White's made since I've owned him.
It's only like 60 miles or whatever, so not a REAL long run, just
enough to get comfortable taking him for trips. Particularly to Hoover
Dam Thanksgiving weekend (still working on the wife for that one...)

Anybody on the list in SoCal going?
