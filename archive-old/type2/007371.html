&gt; &gt;I bought a 78 parts camper with all the bells and whistles including 
&gt; factory AC (no engine or tranny).  There are two radiator looking

the 
&gt; other for an oil cooler?  If not, what's it for?  Many thanx.

&gt; Actually both are for the A/C.  I don't know what they are called,
but 
&gt; that's what they are for.  Never been much for knowing my A/C 
&gt; terminology :-)

These are called the &quot;condensers&quot; since this is where the hot, high
pressure gaseous refrigerant loses heat and condenses to liquid (a
phase change can liberate a lot of energy).

The heat exchanger inside the car is called the &quot;evaporator&quot;, where
low pressure liquid is boiled into gas, absorbing heat from the air
inside of the vehicle.

ACs are funny beasts, boiling at low temperature and condensing at
high temperatures.  Still, that's how they work!
