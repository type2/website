&gt; BUS CONTENT: My case is headed out to the machine shop to be align-bored and
&gt; to have the end thrust cut. The crank will be polished, is that necessary? The
&gt; shop recommends I buy a set of refurbished rods for $50 rather than do the
&gt; work on my rods such as sizing, aligning, and putting one bushing in. Seems a
&gt; little crazy to me. My heads are being done at another place for a total of
&gt; $60. Does anything seem out of the ordinary or is a ok?

Max,

It all sounds very inexpensive to me. Cheap even. Rebuilding the rods, as
long as it is done right - are the rods all the same length when they are
done, is the resizing done accurately - is a ideal. Like anything else in an
engine, the rods wear, which means the dimensions change. Rebuilding
corrects this.

Yeas also to polishing the crank. It is just good practice.
