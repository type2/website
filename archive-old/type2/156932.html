It is pretty much

I've  added

&gt;I have just resigned myself to hear it untill I have
time to rebuid ...

My own '78 engine (GE) would make the tapping lifter
noise. From a cold start to the end of the first mile.
Hot starts and running were without lifter noises.

One time I let it sit without driving for two weeks.
Shame on me. It made the noise louder and for 3 or 2 
miles.

Since February, I have been driving the bus on a daily
basis and the lifter noise is gone.  The cure for my
lifter noise was regular exercise.  YMMV

The green Bentley manual has a page or two on
hydraulic
lifters.  Engine &amp; Clutch, pg 61-63.
