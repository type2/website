Hey All:

I know zippo about campers, other than the fact that I think they're all cool, because I haven't had the experience to fine tune my appreciation. 

I was at a local VW shop yesterday and the owner had what he called a '67 Camper of America.  Not a Westy, not a Sundial, but a Camper of America.  I had never heard this one before.  Original paint.  I didn't take the time to check it out, it had a tarp over it.  I've got to go back down today so I take a closer peek.  So what gives with this particular camper version?  Are they rare, or is there not much discussion on them because they don't compare to a Westy or Sundial?

Robert
