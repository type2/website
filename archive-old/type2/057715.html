Subject: Re: good scenic camping southern NYState, northNJ, or Eastern PA?

Check out Rickett's Glen state park in PA. It is near Wilks Barre -
Scranton area in NE PA. It has an absolutly wonderful hike thru a
gorge, with 15-20 beautiful waterfalls. It's a nice day hike. Just be
sure to wear hiking boots. It isn't a hard hike, but the trail gets
wet near the waterfalls. Sneakers just don't cut it on damp, mossy
rocks. The campsites are nice. Ask the ranger if you can look around
the area first, to pick a campsite. There are some really nice
lakefront sites. It is also quite near Delaware Water Gap. That is a
very senic area. In southern NY, N PA, there is Allegheny State Park
(NY) - Allegheny National Forest. Heart's Content area has a nice hike
thru an area of still virgin forest. I think it's the last one left in
PA. If you are into steam railroad rides, the Knox-Kane RR is in that
area. You can get brochures of attractions, and maps of the National
Forest at the Visitors Center. Since it is a nationa forest, you can
camp either at the campgrounds (many are beautiful, built by the CCC
in the Great Depression), or off of a forest road. There are also
cabins for rent in both NY and PA sections.
