Subject: buyinga bus,was Re: [T2] VW Trademarks

&gt;I am nervous because I have a pretty long
&gt;commute (25 miles each way).  Is it obnoxiously stupid for me &gt;to consider
&gt;using a bus in this way?  Does anyone do this?  Is there any &gt;special
&gt;maintenance considerations?

LOL!!! Thanks I needed a good laugh after my crappy day,,,, =)

But seriously, That kind of mileage a day is no problem. I am a
subcontractor and usually put a minimum of 100 miles a day on my 65
singlecab. I have put up to 250 a day before.

Just make sure all the mechanical maintenance is done and is in proper
working order before you attempt such a feat.

Later-Bryan
