Subject: BIG single Backfire ...

So last night at 10:00 I went outside to start my bus ('73, 1700, Dual 
PDSITS) to drive over to my girlfriends house, I stick the key in, turn 
it to where the pump is running and then turn it all the way to spark 
her up, POP, the loudest backfire I have ever heard, a full blown 
gunshot. Key off, I hop out and open the lid, check plugs still seated, 
hoses connected and for anything visibly wrong only to find it all 
looks fine. I nervously try again, she sparks up and is fine ... I take 
her for a quick spin around the block and there is a little popping 
when I am at the top end of second but its only a little noise, nothing 
like the big bang at the first startup. Do I have an exhaust leak ? I 
just did a valve adjustment a few days ago, could a badly seated cover 
cause this ?

I drive her every day, she run like a top, I had driven all my errands 
around town after work yesterday and she was running perfectly, why 
would she let off such a HUGE backfire ? It was crazy hot all day here 
and fairly cool in the evening though I cant really see what that would 
do.

Any ideas ? Things to investigate ?

Thanks !
Steve
