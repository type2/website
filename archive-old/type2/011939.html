Hmmn, the VW install in my '82 (back in the rear cabinet)
uses a very nice 2 belt system, much improved from the
bus system.  Both are regular 9,5mm VW style belts, but
the one is quite short.

I think though that either/or/both the DPD and the VW &quot;Cool&quot; systems
in the buses used a weird narrow belt with an odd taper, which
is availble in the case of the VW from VW if you could somehow
get the P/N.  The one on the '77 is still intact and I've never
looked at it.  The one on my '78 was never present.  Your install
seems real neat, but I wouldn't guess it is VW, who knows though.
