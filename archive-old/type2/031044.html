recall the light comes on at 7psi or there abouts. 

I used 10-40 for breakin and the guage was almost exactly the same.

&gt; for now, but it suggests to me that the oil pressure is too low, perhaps a
&gt; bad pump?  An obstruction of the oil strainer?  I don't know but I'd like

pumps do wear out, since it was well under $100 I considered it cheap
insurance on a rebuilt engine, and put in a new oil pump

&gt; to.  Does anyone think it is normal for an engine to run slow enough for
&gt; that light to go on?  The engine has 30 wt oil in it, which was
&gt; recommenced by some book for break-in.

I doubt the 30 wt is a problem, I would check your oil pump, it could
cause premature failure.  first thing I think I would do is get  oil
temp/presure guages

find the answer, don't think it is one of those immediate engine killers
but I would not leave it like that
