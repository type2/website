Subject: Neat old bus/lady

Was comming over the &quot;hump&quot; today, on the way home from the center of maximum
capitalism, and saw a &quot;BaY&quot; on the side of the road.  After much protest from
&quot;SWMBO&quot;, pulled over, and within 20 minutes, had a &quot;sage&quot; lady, who knew the
&quot;greatful Dead&quot;, on a first name basis, on her way!  Sometimes, &quot;forgotten
knowledge, mechanical&quot;, is &quot;GOLDEN&quot;!
