Subject: So I call in sick to work on my bus..

That and I really do feel like crap. But there's something theraputic
about working on the bus...

I decide to find out just WHAT is going on with my power loss when the
bus warms up. First thing to check: valves.

#2 and #4 are both too tight. Doh! I must have missed the mark on the
pulley last time. Readjust.

Put my new pertronix in (that was pretty quick getting it back). Using
STOCK coil, no Hyfire for now.

Fire it up and the RPMs run up to 1200. I let it run that way for a
bit to warm up, but the rpms won't kick down. Head back to slow down
the idle. I turn the screw and turn and turn and... seats. WTF? Idle
didn't change. Just to make sure, I disconnected the linkage and
backed out the stop screws on the throttles. No effect. Out comes the
carb cleaner and I start spraying around. Nothing. Must be the volume
screws. No worries...

But... What's that smell? Burning oil? I stick my head under the bus,
Lake BlackGold is under there! I run up front and stop the engine.
Valve cover gasket must have slipped or something. No biggie. Pull,
clean the valve cover, put new gasket in. Assemble, fire it up, oil
still dripping. Grrr...

Engine's too hot to do any more. I'm going to let it cool down before
I go back out. Sigh.

So I'm sitting here ditching work, drinking herbal tea, and wishing my
bus would hurry up and cool off in this wonderful 94 degree heat at
11am.
