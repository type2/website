&gt; Thanks for the &quot;generally&quot; answer Harmon, but I had asked about specifics.
&gt; Do you have anything specific?

       Yeah, that was specific. Go read any auto repair textbook -- breakin
in required on all new engines and/or rebuilts. The rings, for instance,
won't seat properly, and might even break. Call a local car dealer and ask
them about breakin periods on new cars.


&gt; In your earlier post you mentioned that a
&gt; mechanic had showed you examples of engine failures caused by not breaking
&gt;

     Nope, you are mixing me up with someone else.
