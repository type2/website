Subject: Re: [T2] ANOTHER tool wanted to borrow - borescope!

Craig,

Borescopes are more commonly used in the medical and *aircraft* 
industry...go make friends with a certified aircraft A&amp;P mechanic!

Medical borescopes generally cost between $1200 and $15,000!

Aircraft industry(jet engines mostly) use them for inspecting
the turbine blades.

You might have better luck using a computer camera that just has the ccd 
on the end of a long set of wires.


Cheers, dave

&gt; ok, i need to look insde this damn motor and see if something is 
&gt; hitting, or a lifter is wonky, or what, and i'd like to see if i can 
&gt; do it WITHOUT tearing the motor down (untill I HAVE to :P).
&gt; 
&gt; austin is a podunk town w/ no industrial base, and so NOONE sells, 
&gt; rents or uses borescopes here, amazingly enough.
&gt; well, one hotrod shop could order a small one for $250, and one tool 
&gt; shop could sell me one for $2000...3 weeks from now.
&gt; 
&gt; a flexible borescope would be nice, but i could make do w/ a regular one.
&gt; i'd be happy to pay replacement cost up front, and get a refund minus 
&gt; fees later.
