&gt;The above may reflect the overall costs, not the crashworthyness.
&gt;IE: due to the nature of the people that drive vanagons, they may get in less
&gt;crashes than Dodge Vipers, so cost less to insure.

true. but either way, it gives the vanagon a better name. ;)

true. but them living relatives can hire some really viscious lawyers! ;)
