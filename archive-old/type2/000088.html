Subject: Mexican Heads
Message-ID: &lt;0.77a12fd9.254f5562_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello all-
Does anyone have experience of the new VW Mexican cylinder head fitted to a 
stock Type I  (1975 Type I, 1600 cc)? The Mexican head is 043 101 375H (as 
detailed in Wilson’s rebuild book but no sign of CHT fitting hole) and has 
smaller diameter valves - 33 mm intake and 30 mm exhaust - with wider 
diameter exhaust valve stem - 9 mm. These are stainless for use with leadless 
fuel. It also uses long-reach spark plugs. These are new heads made by VW in 
Mexico and I believe they are designed to be used with FI. My bus has a type 
I engine - basically stock with single carb (as with upright engine, 71 and 
earlier buses in US).
I am wondering how the change in design will change engine performance when 
used on the older Type 1 engine......guess there is one way to find out !!! 
but I’d appreciate any comments, good or bad on the subject. 
TIA.........cheers
