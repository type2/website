Well after months of slow engine rebuilding I am back on the road again
with me 1977 VW bus (CA smog ).  I owe thanks to many many list
members, as well as to the Bus Depot and Bear's VW Machine Shop (local to
San Diego ph#619 691 8385).  I should particularly thank list member and
friend Mark Hineline, who has come over to confer several times, about
case splitting, junk yarding, and most recientely solving my new engine no
start problem.  Allow me to summarize my experiences to help future
generations.

I had seen in several books references to the timing mark on the fan of my
type 4 engine.  None of them that I can remember had a very good picture
of it, so when I looked at mine, I saw a factory made bump in te very
furtherest back portion (FIF), and assumed that was the mark. Seemed
logical at the time that the mark woul;d be easy to find.  Well you use
that mark to orient the distributor timing gear, and if yu do that right,
then your dizzy should point at its little mark when your timing mark is
at 0 deg and both of #1's valves are closed... so I got all that set up as
best as I could (mind you the timing mark I was using was wrong), cranked
the engine, and nothing, not really even a single sputter.  Thinking a
lot, trouble with a bad battery, more thinking, checking wires, thinking.
After posting to the list, Mark Hineline writes to me and says gee, it
really sounds like you've got the firing order messed up somehow, you
should double check.  Now since VW was nice, and printed the order right
on the bit of tim which is next to the dizzy, I pretty much knew that I
had it in the right order, and the rotor pointed at the mark when the
engine was at TDC as told by my (incorrect) paint mark.  So I still can't
fix it and I call Mark and he agrees to come over and almost the second he
has walked in he notices that my paint mark is wrong (thank god, I guess
thats why his name is 'Mark'), so then we think a little, and realize that
the mark on the dizzy has no meaning since it is based on the wrong mark
on the flywheel (since I had the Dizzy drive gear out, remember?). and so
we just start turning the dizzy into all sorts of positions, and then
Mark, says, look lets just swap the wires 180 deg and see if that helps.
And we do and it does, and within seconds the thing roars to life and runs
perfectly, like a dream.  Thanks Mark!  And since I'm now in a rush I will
be ending this email.
