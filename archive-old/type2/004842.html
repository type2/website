&gt; Anyone have an extra cooling air flaps/connector link/thermostat/etc
system
&gt; for a 71 1600 DP? Actually need 2 complete sets, one for 71 SC and one for
&gt; 68 DC w/ 71 1600DP. Watching the FART arguments for about 2 years now,
&gt; should be some non-believers out there who would sell me the set(s) they
&gt; pulled out.

And while the subject is up I'm looking for all that stuff as well but for
an 80 2.0L.
