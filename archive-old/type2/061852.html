Subject: Re: Norcold refrigerators

Just a comment to anyone who's $eriou$ about adding refrigeration: take
a look at marine suppliers, such as West Marine.  There are a variety of
options, AC/DC/motor driven, with all of the pluses and minuses cited by
George.

My bus is not a Westy, but my boat is sorta comparable.  You can buy an
awful lot of ice for what refrigeration costs.
