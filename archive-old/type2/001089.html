I restored the interior of my Westy over the last two weeks, which involved
replacing the floor panels. Of course I had to remove the factory underlay
of fibreboard and hardboard and carpet, as well as the vinyl/plastic plate
that screws down right on the edge of the sliding door area. Now that the
new metal is in, I've forgotten completely where the fibre wood floor and
overlaying carpet ended in relation to the sliding door area!! Duh! I will
be putting down new 3/4&quot; marine grade plywood to replace the fibreboard,
then putting kitchen linoleum over that. Could someone be so kind as to
photograph or explain in detail where I should be ending my plywood in
relation to the edge of the door?
Geez, this is embarassing, but a photo is worth a thousand words.
Thanks in advance,
Courtney
