NO FLAME WAR DESIRED

Hi Terry,

   I'm a little confused, I thought we were talking about the difference in
the speed of a &quot;Tig&quot; verse &quot;Mig&quot; machines?
    BTW I have both, a Lincoln Square Weave 175 AC/DC &quot;Tig&quot; (wish it was
water cooled), a Snap-On 119a &quot;Mig&quot; (110 volt light duty machine, body sheet
metal mostly). Along with a, Miller &quot;Zip Cut&quot; Plasma cutter, plus the
ambiguous Oxygen/Acetylene rig, cut off wheels, grinders, BMFH's, etc.
    Back to the topic I answered. Am I wrong, is the &quot;Tig&quot; faster? That is
the topic I addressed, coat hangers aside.
    By nature the speed of a hand held rod machine, or a stick machine,
verse a wire feed machines speed is night and day.
    Simple fact is no matter who is doing the welding. The inch of weld pre
hour of the &quot;Mig&quot; is faster than the inch of weld per hour of a &quot;Tig&quot;
machine. That is what I addressed.
    Anyway Terry as I stated, I didn't mean the pick fly crap out of pepper.
    So, I bow out, with apologies.
