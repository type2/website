Subject: Vacuum %$*#$^_at_

OK, my AVP rebuild has 200 miles, has had two tuneups, and one oil change.
Overall running pretty good.  I have one nagging problem...

I _think_ I have a vacuum leak; the engine tends to idle fast, sometimes as
high as 1500 rpm. It varies at random, and sometimes (when allowed to sit
hot) will idle where it's supposed to: 875 +/- 75 per the CA emissions
sticker.

I've done all the usual stuff:

-All new everything, except for a few NLA hoses which I have scrutinzed
several times.
-Checked Decel valve operation, disconnected and plugged to be sure
-Ruled out brake booster by disconnecting and plugging.
-Same with PCV valve/hose (can the valve be tested?)
-Dissassembled/cleaned/greased throttle body. New gasket.
-Let's just say that EGR can be ruled out now ;O)
-Sprayed penetrating oil all over the place...this does not seem to cause a
jump in rpm.

It show 19-20&quot; when idling too fast; down around 15&quot; when it does idles near
900. It actually had the same behavior before the rebuild...

Any ideas?
