Subject: Re: Attaching script/emblems

OK...
slide the clips in first...stick them in the nose.  Then, line up the
emblem...and press it in.  Put some super glue on the clips and on the emblem
pegs if you want it to be in there a bit more secure...but they are kind of
hard to pull out even without the glue.  Some of the emblems have threaded
pegs with wingnuts on the back...but if someone wants the emblem that
bad...they might damage your nose trying to pull one off thats bolted on.

The rear script mounts as such...
open the rear hatch... take off the panel (if present) then put the script
on.  There are little rubber grommet sort of things that hold it on from the
inside.  I stuck a little glue in there for added integrity.
Personally...I'd keep the dealership tag on...but to each his own...
