Subject: Rescue Mission ('64 Bus, Missouri)

Did I post this already?

There is an early '64 Standard Micro in a scrap metal yard in 
Humansville, Missouri (40 miles north of Springfield on Hwy. 13).  It is 
within 100 feet of a very active crusher (I witnessed the crushing of a 
'78 T-Bird along with some vintage farm equipment while I was there).  
The Bus has been sitting with its doors open for some time, so the 
interior is rough.  The usual rocker rust, some nose damage, no motor, no 
middle seat, no rear drums.  This is too far gone for me to mess with, 
but someone might want to rescue it.  It supposedly has a title.  $150.

Contact Scott Salvage, 417-754-2305.  Hurry, I'm thinking of going back 
for the passenger door and the windshield glass ...

I also talked to someone tonite who gave me directions (middle of 
nowhere) to a supposedly decent '59 Double-Cab for $500 (the owner also 
has &quot;a whole bunch of Volkswagens&quot;).  Let's hope this treasure hunt works 
out better than my last one (&quot;The Lost Treasure of Linden Lure&quot;).  I'll 
keep you posted. :-)
