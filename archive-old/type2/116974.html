Subject: Fuel Line replacement - Nipple on fuel pump came loose

I finally got under the bus today to change the fuel lines on my '73
camper.  It feels good to get a nice snug fit of fresh hoses and clamps.
One problem occured, however.... when I was pulling the hose that goes from
the mechanical fuel pump to the gas filter, the small nipple popped right
off along with the hose.  I changed the hoses and put it back in place,
however I'm not sure if it's safe just to leave it &quot;pushed&quot; back into
place.  Has anyone else had this nipple pop off?  Is it normal?  Do I need
to pull off the fuel pump and somehow glue it back in place more securely?
Am I good to go?

All help much appreciated.  Also I will post a tech article for the
replacement of this model bus ASAP, following Billy's model for the later
models w/ FI.

Thanks,
Shawn.
