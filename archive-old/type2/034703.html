Subject: 091 Ring and Pinion ratios

Hi All,

I have a question regarding the 091 transaxles.  Is it possible to install
the ring and pinion gearset out of a 1600 bus into this transaxle.  I
currently have a heavily modified Bus running an Alloy 270cid (4.4lt) V8
with a custom 091 transaxle.  Currently I run 29&quot; rear tires but am lifting
the Bus both front and rear and will run 33&quot;x12.5&quot;x15&quot; tires on the rear
with custom wheels and obviously cut guards, the 29&quot; tires will go on the
front after a 6&quot; lift.  What this means is I need to lower the gear ratios
in my tranny and I thought the 1600 ring and pinion would be the best
option, that's if it fits to my chromemolly carrier.  Or is the another ring
and pinion that has a lower ratio such as from a 1700 bus (mines from a
2.0lt) that fits straight in.

Cheers
Steve
