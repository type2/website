Subject: Department of how bad ...

... could it possibly be?

I was in Walmart this morning (a place I rarely go) because I needed 
(1) an enameled pot to boil some TSP in, and (2) a pair of coveralls so 
as to keep my promise to my wife that I wouldn't sit in the living room 
in clothes that had been under the bus.

While I was there, I decided to pick up an oil filter wrench. You can 
never have too many oil filter wrenches. When I got home I decided to 
change the oil in my GTI. The spot welds securing the band on the oil 
filter broke off the first time I brought it up tight.

How bad could it possibly be? Worse than you could possibly imagine. 
Don't buy tools at Wally World no matter how simple you think they are.

I sure hope the TSP doesn't boil the &quot;enamel&quot; off my pot.

Oh, and the only coveralls they had were insulated. In San Diego.

Pass


Mark &quot;those ultimate garage tools are looking good to me right about
