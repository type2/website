Hi All

You folks pinging for Greg Coen (that PCII Guy) won't regret the
trip to his shop. These folks know what they're doing. He is a PCII
tuning center - he set up my 00 Road King. When I noticed my gas
mileage drop off he changed the map and I was good to go - no charge.

While your waiting, you can go to Rose's diner (if you can get a seat).
I don't have his shop's address, but he's in Springfield, Or listed
under Greg Coen Motor Company. Oh yeah, he's independent.

Pete
