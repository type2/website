&gt;I consider just passing smog then
&gt;immediately disconnecting the
&gt;thing until next time

for which I had to lay out about $120 a couple of months ago.

And I too have run many miles both with and without the EGR operative,
with no discernible difference.

If anyone is interested in seeing what the innards of a mechancially
operated EGR valve (from a '78 2.0) looks like, there's a pic at:
