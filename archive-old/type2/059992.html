Subject: Surface rust

True surface rust can be pasivated with a number of chemicals, mostly
phosphoric acid and painted. A relativity new product called alumithane
a moisture cure urethane carrier and zinc aluminum filler will also stand
up very well to marine conditions.

This is only true for surface rust. If you seal over a rust pocket you will
have
a relapse of cancer.
