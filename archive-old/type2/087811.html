Subject: Re: [T2] RE: 914 motor into a bus (was 0mile engine) 

Below is an excerpt from the Porsche 914 club FAQ. Unfortunately it
doesn't provide detail, which used to be available, but in my experience
it is essentially correct in broad terms where the 2.0 motors are
concerned. I love the part where it says &quot;The motors are identical,
except for,&quot; then proceeds to list every important component in the
motor. Note that you see here most the basic stuff builders of VW race
motors are after:

__________________________________________________________________

17) Can I use VW parts on my 914?

Yes, you can. Quite a few of the parts are VW parts. I had heard rumors
of a 914/VW cross-index, but that seems to have come to nothing. The 914
uses more or less the same Type IV engine that was in the 411, 412, and
late Transporter (Bus, Vanagon). 

I believe that the earliest motors (the&quot;W&quot; and possibly the &quot;EA&quot; series
motors) are identical or very nearly identical to the corresponding 411
motors. However, the 2.0L engine is a different matter.


To quote Gary Helbig again,


The motors are identical, except for the following items:
1. Case. Stronger, better finish, oil filter in different spot.
2. Flywheel. Cut for larger clutch.
3. Crankshaft. Wider journals, hardened, balanced.
4. Pistons. Higher compression, better quality.
5. Heads. Different port layout, better flow. Better valves (sodium
filled on 2.0)
6. Cam. Different profile.
7. Distributor. Different timing curve. Vacuum retard mechanism added.
8. Fuel Injection. Bigger injectors, subtle changes to controller.


I am told that there is a Bus (2.0L Vanagon) flywheel/clutch/pressure
plate combination which works on the 914 with little or no modification,
and has a larger friction area. It would therefore be stronger and
possibly longer-lasting.
