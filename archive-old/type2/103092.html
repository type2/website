LEGISLATIVE ALERT

Emissions Inspection Exemption for Older Cars: Arizona

A bill (H.B. 2387) has been introduced in the Arizona House of

Representatives to exempt motor vehicles that bear a model year date of

original manufacture that is 25 years old or older from the state's

mandatory emissions inspection and maintenance program. &gt;&gt;

BTW, some info I've read indicate that a major portion of the pollution
a vehicle will produce is in its manufacture...
