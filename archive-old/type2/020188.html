&gt; Does anyone know were I can get poles for a German vw tent?

Period tents of German manufacture?  AFAIK you're out of luck regarding
straight replacements, but many people like Dan Houg and JP Henriksen
have made their own with some success.  Visit
http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/loaves.html and scroll down to &quot;got
pole problems?&quot; for some ideas related to 'driveaway' tents, some of
which may be more generally applicable.  JP's (JPHenrikse_at_aol_dot_com)
homebrew poles look good but I don't have any pix of them -- they're on
a 'privy' model tent.

OTOH, if you're talking about a modern German tent still being
manufactured, perhaps it's one of the models sold by Steve Lashley
through http://www.eurocampers_dot_com/.

I wonder if there's enough market for someone to repop these original
tent styles with modern, lighter materials, yet have the parts
interchange with the vintage models for those needing a few missing
pieces.  Actually, some designs have already been through that (see
Dove, Midwesty, and QuickCanopy at
http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/misc.html) but not the &quot;main tent
sequence&quot;.
