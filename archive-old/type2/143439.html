&gt; Speaking of the carb conversion kit, would there be any benefit to 
&gt; switching
&gt; to a single carb? I've heard that single carb engines are hard to start when
&gt; it's really cold because of the long intakes...thanks.

FWIW, I've been running a Weber for many years... If the choke is adjusted
correctly you should have no problems with cold starts. I also have the carb
sitting on a scrap cube of aluminum so it doesn't &quot;rock&quot; and gets heat from
the case to prevent icing... ;-)
