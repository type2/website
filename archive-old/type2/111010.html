Subject: Re: [T2] fan belt too tight??

Hello,

Having the belt too tight can shorten the life of your
alternator bearings. It puts unneeded stress on the
alternator shaft. I am not sure if the same applies to
type 1 engines but I usually keep closer to 1/2&quot; of
deflection on my type IV engine. Of course, I guess it
depends on how hard you want to press on the belt...

I will quit my rambling. 

Regards,

When I tightened up my Gen pulley
&gt; I had the 1/4&quot; deflection,
&gt; but I was thinking... I didn't measure before, but
&gt; I'm sure it was tighter
&gt; before. The question I have is, can the belt be too
&gt; tight and will this cause
&gt; a break sooner or something?
