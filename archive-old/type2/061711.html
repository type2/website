Subject: RE:  Testing Temp sensor in AFM '78 Bus

	...
	I have a '77 Bus, but two -020 ('78-79) AFMs.
	I have tested these. I came up with these values:

	AFM #A,  temp sensor
	2900 ohms	at 65 F
	13k ohms at 5 F
	17k ohms at -8 F

	AFM #B, temp sensor
	2700 ohms	at 65 F
	11k ohms at 5 F
	16k ohms at -8 F

	Both of these sensors seem to work fine.

	I am looking for a more detailed explanation of how these AFMs work.
A week or so ago, I posted to
	the list about the flap resistance (as it goes through its opening
motion) being cyclic between 
	100 and 400 ohms (it would look like a sine wave on a graph), and
how this does not seem 
	consistent with the common explanation of the flap resistance going
up through its range of
	motion (more air, more resistance). If anyone knows of a more
thorough technical guide to
	AFC-F.I. I would like to see it.

	Part of Original Message below:

	There is a procedure to test the FI temp sensor that is built into
	the Air Flow Meter (AFM), by using an ohm meter on pins 27 &amp; 6.  It
is
	supposed to be under 2500 ohms at room temperature.

	I have two AFM's that both read about 3500 ohms.
	But, I put one in the freezer and tested 26000 ohms, then heated it
by putting it
	on top of the toaster oven ;-) and got 900 ohms.. which makes me
think that the
	sensor isn't stuck.
