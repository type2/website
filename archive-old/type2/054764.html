Subject: RE: light fasteners

&gt;anyone have a quick fix for the white plastic fasteners that hold
&gt;the parking lights in on the rear sides of the bus?  

Depending on how busted-up the little clips are, you may be able to screw a 
screw through from the inside of the bus into the remaining plastic of the 
light housing.  That's what I did for one of mine about 5 years ago and it's 
still good.  Kind of a pain if it's on the side behind the battery, but it's 
not like you have to take it off very often.
