&gt;Here is a random Friday question. Does anyone know how much it would cost to get suicide doors, installed, in a bug? Now i know that this isnt a Bug list, but im sure that there are people who know people, if they havent themselves, who have suicide doors in their bugs. What about any drawbacks to them?? Let me hear some feedback from people and what they think of them.

Let's not hear feedback on this list.  You are correct that type2 is not a bug list - even on Fridays posts must have bus content (according to the charter).

Thanks,
