Subject: Head Torque Question (1600 DP)

Hi Folks!

I just got back from Central Illinois and boy are my arms tired.  Had
crosswinds most of the way.  Anyway, while in IL I had an electrical
problem that I couldn't figure out.  I took it to a local VW mechanic
that I trust.  He found the problem and fixed it but said that my heads
were loose.  He was leaving on vacation and didn't have time to do
anything about them.  He suggested that I pull the valve covers and
re-torque the four nuts that you can get to that way.  I did this in
Illinois.  A week later I drove back here to Texas.  Now I plan on
pulling the engine and re-torquing the heads properly.

That's the question - how do I do this properly?  I have Muir and
Bentley so I have the diagram for the sequence.  Should I loosen all the
nuts first and then go through the torque sequence? Or should I just go
through the sequence with out loosening the nuts?  Or should I do
something else?  And finally, how often should this be done?  I replaced
the heads, pistons and cylinders on the engine 5 or 10 thousand miles
ago.  I think I should have re-torqued the heads before this but is
there a recommeded interval for this proceedure throughout the life of
the engine?  Will these questions never end? ;)

Thanks in advance,
