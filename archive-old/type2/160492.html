Subject: Re: [T2] Engine health? Kind of longish

Hmmm. Maybe I've had bad info about oil lights, I've
been operating on that assumption for years...

20W50, maybe 10-12K on the rebuild from a reputeable
shop.
 
It only flickers at idle after a long highway run on a
warmish day. After a couple minutes it stops
flickering. No light and 30-60psi above idle. Oil
temps look typical.

I'm using a VDO sender, maybe the light trigger is
more sensitive than it should be?

It's hard to read the bottom end of the VDO gauge
accurately on the fly, I'll have to try to pay more
attention to it. With oil temp at 220+, what would be
the minimum pressure I would want at idle?

&gt; hey Rick  Would you like to see some pictures of the
&gt; type4 cases that  have 
&gt; thrown rods thur them. I have about 4 or 5 of them
&gt; piled out back.   Had one 
&gt; throw a rod that went thur the cold start injector
&gt; and burnt the bus to  the 
&gt; ground. Later  Mark Dearing
