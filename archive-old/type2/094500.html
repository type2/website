Subject: Back brake stuck onto wheel

My rear right side brake (I presume the hand brake) seems to be stuck to
the wheel . I release the handbrake and the van won't budge. It was only
a few days since I was last driving it but had been raining a lot if
that has anything to do with it.

Anyone any ideas on how to unstick it ?

Cheers
