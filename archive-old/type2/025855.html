&gt; Two - Went out to the bus after work and put the key in
&gt; and got nothing - no click, no tick, no lights, no
&gt; nuthin.' Went to the back of the bus and opened up
&gt; the decklid and saw that the + cable had come off the
&gt; battery. I reconnected it after completely disconnecting
&gt; the battery and then hooked everything back up. The way
&gt; I figure, it was been barely attached (dangerous!). It
&gt; is now secure, though.

Your battery clamp is worn out if a bump can knock it off. It happens; these
are made from lead. Wal-Mart has Exide battery clamps for $3.50 per pair;
get a pair and the $2 acid-neutralizing felt washers and change them both.
You'll be much happier. I could give you instructions on filing the gap so
the bolt will tighten the clamp more, but these are so cheap it's quicker
and better to put on new ones.

Also, clean the battery terminals and put a little axle grease on them
before you attach the new clamps; this further helps keep corrosion at bay.
