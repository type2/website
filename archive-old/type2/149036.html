Subject: 2006 Events

Bus driver,
I am putting together the 2006 events page for the LiMBO web site. If 
you have any 2006 or December 2005 events dates you know of please 
forward them to me. No matter how small or large the event is I'l like 
to list it.
Example what are the dates for Everybus,Buses of The Corn ect... You 
can email me at    thegreenwesty_at_netscape_dot_net or my new email 
events_at_limbobus_dot_org  .

Thanks,
Bill Monk
