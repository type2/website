Nope. A longer or shorter tube would be OK. VW themselves used  
identical FI in the vanagon with a shorter S-tube.

&gt; can you drill the case for a top pull out dip stick with out  
&gt; getting fillings in the engine (I don't want to take it apart)

I would be careful, but if a spark-plug is do-able, a dipstick tube  
should be. At least in this case you can access the back of the hole  
through the case breather. Use a grease-covered rag to catch all the  
aluminum filings. Or perhaps you could fabricate a u-pipe for a shop- 
vac to put through the breather hole that would catch all the filings.

I have a top-fill top-dipstick T4 engine in my bus right now, but I  
think a swap would be more trouble than it's worth.


Happy Trails,
