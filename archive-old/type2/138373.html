Subject: Re: [T2] FREE*   #2

I have the plate but not the cover -- in fact, I wasn't even aware of 
the cover until an hour ago -- and regularly saw temps in the 240-250 
degree range on the slightest incline. Is it possible that the sender 
was sending higher temps because of the absence of the cover?

&gt; illusion
&gt; that makes it look like is it sticking IN, when it is sticking OUT.
