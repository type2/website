Subject: Re: [T2] The early pop top hinges

I have the same problem on my '69 Westy but the rain does not come in
because of a ridge and the canvas for the pop top.  You may not have the
black rubber seal that should line the whole edge of the pop top.  That
may run you up to $200 to replace.  I decided not to go that route and
just have used two tennis balls on the two front corners to keep the top
raised so it does not move around.  That says something about me i guess.
