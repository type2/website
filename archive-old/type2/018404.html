&gt; Yesterday I removed the fuel tank from my 78 Westy.  Around the area where
&gt; the 2 nipples for the fuel injection lines to attach there is rust,
&gt; approximate 2-3 inches diameter.  There is also a fuel leak around that
&gt; area.  In addition it is apparent someone tried to solder/weld this area
&gt; before.  The rest of the tank looks good except it does need cleaning out.
&gt; Advise I need, just chuck the old tank and get a new one or have this one
&gt; repaired?
Richard:
The solder is original equipment. I'd take the tank to my friendly local
gas tank/ radiator shop and ask them. If you're in the midwest (as I
suspect) finding a good one may be difficult.  Southwest US junkyards
are the best source, but shipping one from a dry climate may be a
problem. You must have one with 2 outlets (75-79) if you are using the
original fuel injection.
