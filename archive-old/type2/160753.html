Hi Ted,

I'm not from the area, so I can't recommend specific shops. But  
regardless of who you're dealing with it will help to be very precise  
on determining the terms of the work BEFOREHAND.

Are you doing the prep, or are they? Proper prepping of the vehicle  
should take several hours. If it needs bodywork as well it could take  
days.

If possible, I would recommend you do preliminary prep before  
delivering the bus. If you're going with a budget shop (Maaco/Earl  
Schrieb) then remove bumpers, trim, lenses &amp; door handles. jalousie  
windows, etc.  The less stuff they have to tape off, the better your  
end product will look.

I got a Maaco paint-job 5.5 years ago and have been very happy with  
it. Next time I will probably shoot it myself, but for the $400  
invested I was quite happy with the outcome. A full-service shop  
could have easily run to 10X that price... but that's more than I am  
comfortable spending on paint for a utility vehicle. YMMV.

Another issue would be turnaround... You can often get better terms  
if you are willing to wait. This is particularly true with custom  
colors or expensive paints. If they can shoot two vehicles in a row  
with the same colour they save the cost of time and materials for  
cleanup.

Happy Trails,

&gt; recomendations you guys want to suggest?
