John,

Thanks for weighing in on this. You have a lot more experience that I do!

&gt;The synthetic oil &quot;truth&quot; is based on testing when? 197x? I assure you, oils

&gt;in oil temps, with other engine temps staying the same or dropping, PROVIDED
&gt;you use one of a couple brands of oil.

I agree. My own unscientific test was done on a  tired 1979 2.0 liter 
engine that always seemed about 10 degrees hotter than I like it. I 
picked a 10 mile stretch of 4 lane divided highway and ran the bus 10 
miles, took an exit and turned around and went the other way back. I 
kept the bus at a steady 60 mph and noted the oil temp at various 
uphill grades and especially when I was turning around to go back. 
Some times I would run the route 4 times.  When the rpm dropped and 
the oil pressure did as well and the oil temp went up quickly until 
rpm 60mph was reached and then the motor cooled down. These was done 
over the period of a week with temps about 90 degrees.

I would try various things to get the temps down. The most dramatic 
was when I witched from 20/50 Castrol to 5/50 synthetic. Temps went 
down about 10 to 12 degrees at highway speed. Oil pressure held up a 
little higher as far as I could tell. When I stopped at the top of 
the exit ramp with I never saw the oil light flicker with synth in 
the motor.

&gt;The benefits of synthetics are not utilized if you don't have good
&gt;filtration, since to remove the dirt you have to change the oil ($$$$).

So do you think a stock type1 setup without a full flow filter could 
handle the synth if oil change were done more frequently? If so what 
would the recommended interval be? You are not kidding the stuff is 
expensive :)

&gt;Otherwise we'll all be driving with Bias Ply tires, straight weight oil, and
&gt;AM radios.

I still the radio block off plate in the 68. AM radio would be an upgrade :)
