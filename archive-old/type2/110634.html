&gt; &gt; I have spent two days roaming wrecking yards from Eugene almost

&gt; &gt; The ones with engines in them I could not touch unless I wanted
&gt; &gt; to buy the engine. One place even quoted me $2k for a 1.7l engine
&gt; &gt; of unknown functionality (I think there must be some really
&gt; &gt; good crack going around these parts.)
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW, the 1971-72 411 had an almost identical 1700 engine and they are
&gt; interchangeable, and probably a lot cheaper....

That's good to know, but I believe the bellhousing situation will be the same
with a 411 or any other vehicle. The problem seems to be that when the
wrecking yard pulls the engine the tranny disappears with it.
Nobody had a tranny. I suspect that what they do is when someone buys
an engine the pull the engine and tranny together, sell the engine, and
pile the tranny up in the big heap of scrap that is off limits to customers.
Either that or they sell them to rebuilders as cores.  Either way, I don't
have access to them without buying an engine I don't need.
