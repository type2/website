Subject: ASAP!  Stick welding tips needed!

Well, the only thing I've managed to get ahold of to rebuild this 72;s
clutch tube is a good ooool' arc welder.  Stick.

I know it'll do the job, or, it hasta.

I know lots of the fundementals of welding, or at least for MIG and
such.  Dunno much of a damn thing about stick though.

Well, a little bit, but i'm looking for any tips tricks or other such info
you guys have got...It'll be showing up about the time I get off work
tomorrow....:)

'preciate it folks......david
