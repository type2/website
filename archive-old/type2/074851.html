Subject: Re: [T2] Re-blowing air up gas line line

On my Beetle the water settled (gas floats on water) to around the wire 
filter in the tank and rusted the wire until it came apart (30 year 
process) and everything floating about plugged up the fuel line.

Used a combination of a cable to run back and forth through the lines 
+cable tubes and air.

&gt;Last year I had a rust silt problem (lots of hesitation at full
&gt;throttle)-filter was plugged up, rust came out of the line when flushed
&gt;into a pail, then it ran clear.  New filter, ran fine.  Later (8 mo) I
&gt;changed my clutch and decided to
&gt;blow air up the (empty) gas tank line on my 78 as gas was run out, and
&gt;could hear the inlet screen happily tonking across the bottom of the
&gt;tank!  Presumably rust may have been sitting on the screen and resisted
&gt;the air flow. Still running ok but I'm watching the fuel filter- why
&gt;can't these be trqansparent??
