Subject: help with FI and running troubles

Hi All,

I've got the injectors working but still no fire in #3 and weak to no fire in
#4.  I have good spark and seem to have good fuel, so must be an air problem
right?  I did the cleaner/spray test for vacuum leaks and found no evidence of
a leak.  Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Sean
