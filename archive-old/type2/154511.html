&gt; I've just bought a CD/Mp3 player that I'm going to install into my 77 
&gt; Westy.
&gt; Our vehicles do not have an accessory spot on the ignitions, just off or 
&gt; on.
&gt; How are people wiring their players in?

Coutney
here is a circuit for the 77-79 buses.

If you use a spst relay,, like the VR-1 bosch.... you can wire it to create 
an accessory as long as the key is in the ignition.. no need to turn it on.. 
just place it in the ignition..  it works off the key reminder buzzer 
circuit

supply relay term 30 with fused power... connect relay term 86  to terminal 
SU on the ignition switch... which is grey/black wire .... ground relay 
terminal 85.. and connect your radio to relay terminal 87

when the key is inserted.. the buzzer circuit powers the relay... which 
supplies power to the radio.

I love it this way.. when I get gas.. I turn the engine off.. but leave the 
key in.. not on.. just in....and the radio stays on.. I have my CB radio 
connected to terminal 87 too...
