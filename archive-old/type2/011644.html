Subject: stainless exhaust and 009 dist

wow greg, thanx. i've been look'n 4 stainless for the longest, old volks home, eh?  stainless? definately. i hate the stock or aftermarket stock mufflers, my baffle holders would fall off and the things would crack, rot, blow holes any/everywere (went thru three mufflers on the last motor). dunno about porcelin for something that close to the road, 4 it will chip. hey, maybe porcelin coated stainless? 4 show, the everlast muffler 4 400,000 mls. the 009, i've been told, is best 4 hot rodded vws. vacuum advance, for the daily driver equals smoother acceleration &amp; fuel economy. maybe u wanna use an electronic kit 4 the distributer that u choose, pertronic is it? (always keep the original points 4 those falty kits/emergencies) there's also a super charge coil available by the same folks. then again, maybe i've gone off the deep end again. (boing, boing, boing goes the wingnutt)
