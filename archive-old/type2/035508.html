&gt; my accelerator cable on Stella decided to snap last night in the frigid

&gt; anyways...whats the easiest way to do an accelerator cable with basic
&gt; tools (in my bus :) and in the freezing cold.

in an emergency I have used a regular piece of electrical wire to run back
to my accelerator, worked for a couple weeks until I put in a &quot;real&quot; cable


and once out on the road I actually ran a string thru the open engine
hatch to the front and pulled it to go fasster.  (just to get off the
interstate and I am used to using hand controls)
