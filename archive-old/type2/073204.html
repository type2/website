This is a VERY frequently asked question. 90% of the time this problem will
go away if you scrupulously clean all connections at the battery and
starter, and pay special attention to the ground strap. Polish well the
place where the ground strap is bolted to the body. Unfasten, then hit
every electrical connection hard with a wire brush.

If that doesn't work, replace both battery cables. Even if they look good.

If that doesn't work, note that the wiring path for the ignition is very
long, and install a Bosch WR1 kit (instead of the Muir solenoid stunt). An
archive search will turn up lots of information, and here is the definitive
short answer written years ago by Steve Dolan:

The archive, which contains answers to years' worth of questions and which
Stephen Gutknecht goes to a good deal of trouble and expense to maintain,
is here:

&gt;The starter has been funny, when I first got the bus, I would turn the
&gt;key and it would click, but not start, after a few trys it always
&gt;cranked properly.  Then it started to struggle more and more every time
