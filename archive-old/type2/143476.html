&gt; got a chance to tear it down later and it was indeed a broken crank.
&gt; 
&gt; No one else had ever heard of such a thing at the time, so it was weird.

Hey guys  I have seen this a bunch of times. I had one break on me and it was 
the only ride I had at the time. Drove for six months like that 20 miles a 
day, totally trashed that case. Same old single cab started losing gears also at 
the same time , finally was doing the trip with just first and second , 
Really dont like thinking about some of the old days when I had only one ride and 
no money. Now I have 13 VWs and Porsches on the road and own my own business 
and we are doing very well , Thank you  . The last crank I broke was in my 64v  
356C  eruo  and that thing was costly to fix, do not want to have to do that 
again  LOL  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
