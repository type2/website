	well i think this might be my last post on this list....

me and some friends were driving my 72 bus to hardees for some lunch, right
before the last turn it died and i try to start it back up again, so i turn
the key....no-go. so we all got out and pushed it to the parking lot, ate and
got a ride back with a friend.

all accessories come on when key is turned...goes to the cranking part of the
switch, but the engine doesnt crank. there is power to the ingition coil,
starter solonoid, and everything else.    when put in the cranking position,
the interior light dims a bit. it is now in my garage...waiting....


one more- what do you all think i could get for this? a 72 bus,sorta made into
a camper(table, bed)  it's body is perfect, no rust, new paint, new front seat
covers, 6,000 miles on complete rebuild, i am in minnesota, near fargo, north
dakota.
