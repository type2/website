You will not find that dizzy listed on any VW application list [0 231 170 010]
because it is NOT a VW dizzy!  It is for a 72-74 Audi 100LS, GL......  Talk about mis-matching parts.

WOW nice catch! thanks alot!
soooo...i take it that i'm better off with my 009, for now.?.? or what should i do? i'm lookin at a 1800mile drive here in a few weeks. headin back to the rainbow gathering.(which is where i found our bussie, last year.) and i'd like to get all her kynks out, before we hit the road.
i was pointed to the oldvolkshome, for the correct distributor number. and found these listed. which would obviously be my best route to take. 
if anyone out there can help me and has an xtra distributor that will fit my bus? let me know and maybe we can work out some type of trade. these are the distibutors that the OVH listed for my 70Westy. 
VW 113-905-205T, Bosch 0231 137 035 or 036
Can Use: VW 113-905-205M, Bosch 0231 137 021

thanks always, for the time and attention u all have spent on helpin us. a gr8ful peace out to everyone on here. *shine on* -Chris
