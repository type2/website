&gt; According to my vague knowledge and to what I have read on the

&gt;
&gt; This applies to battery trays, stainless steel screws, etc.

even mufflers????   I have the SS muffler that Ron sells on my bus...

however the rust is such that I doubt if it could go any faster, trying to
make sure my welding is staying ahead of the rust.
