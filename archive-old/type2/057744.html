Subject: Dash brake warning light

My brake dash warning light is on all the time (with ignition on).  The 
brakes have just been done, and the switches on the master cylinder are 
new.  Is there some way to test the dash light device itself?  I don't 
really feel like paying $90 just to find out the problem hasn't been fixed.

P.S. The wiring is as it should be (per Haynes manual).

Thanks,

Adrian L.
