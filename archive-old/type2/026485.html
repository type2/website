&gt;The first question is, if these are 1700cc heads, will 1800cc cylinders 
&gt;fit on the motor without machining?

When I rebuilt my 73 Westy's motor 8 years ago, I bought new Mark Stephens
heads.  Of course, I ordered stock heads for a 1.7 since that's what I
thought I had.  Boy, did I feel stupid when I had to take my brand-new heads
to the machine shop to have them cut to fit the 1.8 P&amp;C's that had been
installed by the PO.  Don't worry, it's a pretty inexpensive thing to have
done.

The 1.7 heads' intake valves are slightly smaller than the 1.8 (39.3 vs
41.0), but don't let that bother you.  It will cut down slightly on your
upper-end power (like 4500 RPM and up), but will actually give you a little
better low-end grunt.
