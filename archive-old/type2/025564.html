&gt; At the same time, Germany, and most of Europe did not go to catalytic
&gt; converters and unleaded fuel.  I think it was the late 80s or early 90s that
&gt; Germany went to the unleaded and catalytic converted cars.

More like early to mid eighties. I got to Berlin on Veteran's Day 1986, and
catalytic converters were on German cars then.

Wild thing...remember when catalytic converters first came out in the
States, and people illegally took them off their cars? The muffler shop down
the street from Andrews Barracks did big business in putting catalytic
converters on cars that didn't come with them.
