Well, the legalities of bus ownership have been taken care of, and I traveled    across town with my friend Rick to pick up the '69.  Amazingly, we didn't have to do anything to it to drive it home.  My wife was less than thrilled to see another VW in the yard, as I just sold my Beetle the other day (she thought we were done with VWs for good).  She did comment that the Bus has more character than the Beetle did.  I take this as a good sign.8^)

Anyways, I did want to inform anyone who's interested that the Cool Breeze VW club from Cleveland,TN is having their annual Hanging' Dog VW campout at the Hanging Dog National Campground in Western North Carolina the 13,14,and 15 of Sept.  Anyone that's interested, the campsites are $4, and potluck items are welcomed.  If anyone is _REALLY_ interested, I'll give out more info.  Should be a good weekend, seeing as there's lots of nice scenery up there in NC.


FINALLY cruisin in a Bus,
