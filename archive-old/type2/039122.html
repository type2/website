&gt; After driving in  town, just a short trip, When shut down, this puppy
&gt; is hottr'n a popcorn, , , well, you know.
&gt; Actually it's about as hot as if you had driven a water cooled engine
&gt; without water.
&gt;
&gt; Smokin' hot!!

&gt; I suspect the carb is set too lean.
&gt; It's a '72 with single carb.
&gt; The tin has large gaps it it, also. Would that be a problem?
&gt;
&gt; Can any one help me out here?
&gt; TIA
