Subject: Bringing it all back (longish)

My first journey...

I had an eventful time bringing my newly purchased bus back home.   Seemed
fine for much of the journey - the first 50 miles or so, when I got 'Red
Light On' - so I stopped immediately suspecting a broken fanbelt.  And it
was (of course) and so I searched through the boxes of spares in the back to
no avail - so I had to use a roadside phone to get a friend to come out with
one.  When I got back to the bus my daughter (along for the ride) said, what
does a fanbelt look like ?  - and presented me with one !   (She'd found it
in one of the cupboards)   So with my minimal toolkit I fitted it and 10
minutes later we were back on the road and I phoned my friend to say that
&quot;false alarm - but thanks anyway !&quot;.   We carried on back to Cardiff and
then, just two miles from home the engine just died !   - ugh !  what now ?
- Well I coasted into a layby and checked things over...  NO SPARK !
Nothing I could do here,  it was very late by now, so we just had to walk
home, leaving my precious bus alone in a layby on a very busy road - with
huge great trucks zorching past just inches away.   

So next morning I didn't go to work, but went to buy a new coil etc...
Fitted it and still got no spark ?  .....  Ah !  well actually I did get a
spark from the coil, it just didn't get to the plugs,  so I looked at the
rotor and it looked pretty scorched and burnt.   So I went to get a new
one....  Didn't fit properly.... tried it anyway and it kind of worked - for
just long enough to pull the bus out of the layby before dying again - the
(wrong) rotor had mangled the inside of the distributor cap !   - So
eventually I phoned a (different) friend to borrow a whole distributor and
drive it home.

So it only took me 26 hours to drive 80 miles !   

But BIG thanks go to my friends Gareth and Roy - for their help.

And my bus is now safe at home.      And all those lessons I learnt a decade
ago about driving old VW's have come flooding back...  ALWAYS carry every
conceivable spare + as many tools as practical !
