I have a 1600 DP, with a 34 pict 3, and IM trying to get the carb adjusted
good..(followed Bentley, didn't help) .problem is that it runs OK but, runs
way better when the choke is on I rev the engine and it is smooth...I open
choke and when I rev the engine it misses a little at the beginning...so its
getting to much 02 ...which of the screws adjusts o2...the little one under
the idle right...I just cant get the two  right..I screw the little one in
like Bentley says and back out 2 turns...the bus wont run.or I let it out
and its a high idle..ive been messin around with this for a few days and
just cant seem to get the sweet spot...the biggest clue for the list that it
runs good with choke closed...even when warmed up...im not that picky...ill
handle a 950 to 1000 rpm for a good smooth acceleration


TIA Chad
