Subject: Ever try to close the sliding door by pushing it?  Don't.

At least not on my bus.  Doh, doh, double-doh!  For
some unknown reason I decided to close the sliding
door on my 77 Westy by pushing it instead of using the
handle.  Crack! That little plastic slider-thingy on
the rear hinge/roller broke!  Crap!!!!  I looked in
the Bentley manual which showed an early bus and it
looked like that plastic piece was bolted on.  I
looked at my bus and it's riveted on.

So, does anyone know if just that little plastic piece
can be replaced or do I need the entire hinge/roller
assembly?  Or is it worse than that and require an
entire door assembly?  It can't be that bad, right?

I was searching the Bus Depot, is this the piece I
need?  Ron?

guidepiece, hinge, sliding door (68-79 Bus)  $4.39 211
843 368

I hope so, cuz it's cheap!

Thanx as always,

Bob J.
