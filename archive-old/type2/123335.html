&gt; I need a cylinder head for my 78 2.0 l its got the square exhaust ports.

that would of course be 79 heads on your engine.  since 78 buses have the
oval ports.

&gt; Mine's got a crack running out of one of the valves. Is this machineable and
&gt; if so where should I go to do that?

the person doing it would have to be VERY good, I wouldn't trust it.  Ron
has rebuilt heads that are decent, I have em on my bus new for years
