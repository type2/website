&gt; 	I was curious what some of you guys use to insure your VW
&gt; Transporters.

before I got married I used Maryland Casualty, (now Farmer's
insurance) but after getting married they wouldn't insure my wife's S*turn
for a reasonable amount and her insurance wouldn't put full coverage on my
bus...(yes I know crazy) so now we actually found insurance from Met Life.

more than $170 a month but both cars have full coverage, including rental
car and mine has an assigned value policy on the bus (extra $200 a
year) and we have much higher than minimum coverage because we both carry
a bunch of kids in the cars occasionally.

  your paying (170X12) about $2040 a year, were paying more than that but
not much, and we live in the downtown area of a major eastern city.

how many accidents and tickets have you gotten recently????
