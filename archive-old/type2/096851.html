Subject: type IV flywheel question

seems i'm missing something as i attach the flywheel onto a type4 - there's
a component in the bentley manual fig. 16-2, part #23 and it is called the
felt ring for pilot bearing. what does this do, and is it essential?  -
steve, wondering while the parts store is closed
