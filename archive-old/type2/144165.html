Subject: Re: [T2]Higher oil Temp gauge?

so does this mean that when my light came on it was about 4psi?....
so should i be worried here ....? drove her yesterday and didnt get that hot but didnt drive long enough either.... she got up there though the few minutes i drove her... also she chugs a bit to shut off ..... deffinetly getting hot.... the carb has been checked so that the idle is right etc....
 
only chugs after the engine gets good and warm also at shut offs but funny thing is dont always chug when shutting engine down....
 
the oil light coming on has me worried though.....
will be chageing oil soona nd looks like i am getting a exteranl oil cooler next week sometime or the stuff to do it with anyways should bring that temp way on down...xing fangers

Guys, stock pressure sender comes on about 4psi and the dual vdo comes on 
at 11'ish.


I'm sure Karl or someone will correct me if the stocker is different for 
buses.

For temps over about 50 I generally figure 120 degrees + ambient....at 
least that has been my experience in the past with my engines(bug and 
bus).

I can see a 30 degree difference on my daily drive between morning(60-70) 
and afternoon(85-100)...oil temps come up on the way home almost exactly 
the ambient temp difference.

Don'f forget about the silly VDO oil temp non temperature corrected 
variation...see Richard's site for that info.



Cheers, dave
