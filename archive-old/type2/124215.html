Subject: Re: [T2] 70 bus front end sits higher than back end...what can
  it be

&gt; Im looking at a 70 bus, it looks pretty good, engine rebuilt not too
&gt; long ago except the front end sits higher than the back end (looks like
&gt; its going to pop a wheelie-not that bad but you get the idea). Is this
&gt; a major problem, what might this be?

My 70 of which I am the original owner has always been a little high in the
front - don't know why.
