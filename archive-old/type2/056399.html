Subject: Re: L-Jetronic help needed

&gt;Anybody very familiar with how the fuel pump gets voltage on the 
L-Jetronic system?  I have a 1980 Westy that was running OK when I 
bought it a few weeks ago.  Well, it didn't start up cold very well; you 
had to push the accelerator while cranking (I think I now know why, I'll 
mention that soon).  Cranks but won't start since I installed new engine 
compartment gasket.  I'm thinking electrical - connector loose or 
broken, right?
&gt;
&gt;I decide to get down and look at solenoid because I just bought it and 
was experiencing weak cranking.  VERY crusty.  Apply torque to nut with 
all of those crucial connections to clean them, and CRACK.  The whole 
bolt breaks out of the solenoid.  To keep this brief, I have installed a 
new starter/solenoid and replaced/crimped all new wire connectors to the 
solenoid terminals and installed the Bosch WR1 relay kit.  This is when 
I notice that a small ~20 gauge brown and blue wire is just hanging off 
of the old solenoid with a wire nut on the end.  It turns out that this 
is the wire that powers the cold start valve to squirt a little gas with 
cold engine. 

Nope, that's not how it works.  The cold start valve gets its juice from 
the double relay and is grounded when conditions are right by the 
thermo-time switch.  Now that wire on the starter could act as a signal 
for the double relay to hit the cold start valve with some 12v+ (since 
the cold start valve only operates while the starter operates) -- I will 
have to check the wiring diagram on that one...


 I connect it with a new T1 connector and feel virtuous.  Now it cranks 
beautifully, and will fart once and then die.  I think this is because 
of that wire.  PO had told me that it was normal to push the accelerator 
pedal to start - I knew I was right on this one.
&gt;
With a properly set up FI and ignition system, you should not have to 
touch the gas to start the engine.


&gt;Here's what I've tried:
&gt;
&gt;With the throttle valve open and the key in the &quot;ON&quot; position, the fuel 
pump does nada (maybe half a volt).

It's not supposed to do anything under these circumstances.  So far it's 
working normally.

  I've also tried bridging the two contacts of the TV connector to test 
whether it is mechanically bad.  While the starter is cranking, the fuel 
pump is receiving ~10 volts.  This is not enough according to Bentley.  
But still, the first test bothers me.
&gt;
Sounds like your battery is somewhat discharged.  The engine WILL NOT 
START if battery voltage goes below a certain point.  The FI needs a 
certain voltage to work.  Charge that battery.


&gt;The double relay.  I really want to understand this thing.  I've done 
the Bentley test where test light is used to show voltage during 
cranking.  All test OK.  Ground wire (85) is crusty, so I cleaned and 
tightened - even used alligator clip to attach to known good ground with 
no change.  I suspect that the relays might be the problem since it 
could have been damaged when I installed the seal, but can't fully test 
it without some help.  By the way, my relay looks different from every 
other photo I've seen (Bentley, Sean's tech articles, etc.).  Mine is 
one black plastic housing; most others look like two separate aluminum 
housings.
&gt;
The double relay is in one housing.  The pic you have seen on my page is 
probably the double relay (one aluminum housing) next to the series 
resistors (another metal housing with tubey things in it).  The double 
relay is simple, it's just two relays in one housing.  One relay is the 
fuel pump relay, the other is the FI system power relay.  

I think your fuel pump and double relay are working normally.  Here's 
how it works:

1) key off, fuel pump off, etc.
2) key on, power side of double relay closes, gives FI system power.  
fuel pump still off.
3) key to start, wire on starter solenoid triggers fuel pump side of 
double relay and fuel pump starts.  Fuel pump will remain running as 
long as the starter operates and will shut off if the key is released 
and the engine does not start.  If the engine does start, power to the 
fuel pump is sustained by a set of contacts in the air flow meter that 
close when the AFM flap deflects due to the incoming air.  But if the 
engine dies, the flap closes and the contacts are opened, fuel pump 
shuts off.

Assuming your ignition system is all OK, the fact that you have to step 
on the gas with cold engine indicates to me that perhaps you have a 
faulty auxiliary air regulator.  You might want to remove it and make 
sure it works like it's supposed to.  If it is not opening when cold 
(like it should) the cold engine may be hard to start.  May also have a 
cold start valve problem (i.e. not operating) but of course it can only 
be tested when the starter is cranking.  If the CSV is not operation be 
aware that the problem could lie in the CSV itself, but it is more 
likely that the problem lies in the thermo-time switch.  The TTS 
provides a ground path for the CSV when the engine is cold.  No ground, 
no CSV work.  

So, if I were you here's what I would do.

1) charge battery (should be ~12.5v if fully charged)
2) re-check wiring on starter -- often, when replacing the starter, you 
leave off one of the big wires that goes to terminal 30 (the big post 
terminal).  This wire hides up on top of the heater hose, and the engine 
WILL NOT START without it, and in fact it gives symptoms exactly like 
you are describing.  So crawl under there one more time and check for 
loose wires.
3) Check wiring diagram for FI and match this up with your system, 
especially connection on solenoid.  
4) Thoroughly check out ignition system, usually the cause for hard 
starting.
5) Check out auxiliary air regulator and/or CSV/TTS for possibly 
unrelated problem of hard starting when cold.

Hope this helps
