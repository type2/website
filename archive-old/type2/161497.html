Subject: air control box

I am slowly but surely getting my 73, dual carb, mostly stock camper road
worthy.  I am pretty sure I finally fixed the oil leaks with a new cooler and
seals.  I also but some Hankook RA08's on it and love them.  Now I am tackling
the small less critical things.  I plan on replacing the fuel lines tonight.
(yes this it small but not less critical) I have a few questions about the air
control unit.  It is my understanding that the control unit directs air intake
from the engine bay until the thermostatically controlled  switch tells the
vacuum from the right intake manifold to close the flap and pull air from
outside the engine compartment.

First at some point the right elbow on the balance tube was replaced with out
a tee to go to the control box so there is no vacuum to close the flaps. So by
default the air intake is from the engine compartment.

Is it better to pull air from the outside or inside the engine compartment?

Is there a way to test the unit to make sure it is working?

Did the 73 get its vacuum from tee on the elbow that connects the right side
of the balance tube to the intake manifold or from somewhere else?

Thanks for any help.

-Daniel
