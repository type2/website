Subject: Share your knowledge-need a good bus



I am trying to find a solid bus to do some travelling in. I live in London, 
Ontario (1-2hrs from Detroit Michigan &amp; Toronto, Ontario)

Please email me if you have any leads on a vw camper van in good shape. I 
prefer the more original ones. [?1971-1978?]

Can anyone tell me what year the green and the orange van were (with the 
matching plaid interior)

Can anyone recommend a particular year (better engine, more space, camping 
equipment or arrangement of the interior)

Anything to point me in some direction for my search would be GREAT!

Thanks Cj
