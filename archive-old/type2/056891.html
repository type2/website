Subject: 1972-73 only

While trying to dig out some 1974 1800cc pistons and lliners,

I found 2 NEW 1700cc pistons/rings/liners
1972 and 1973 only, I believe
I wold love to get them off the shelf, and make room for more 36hp stuff
I have had them more than 10 years and got them form a shop that had been
closed for morre than 10 years.  they are still in 2 separate boxes
NEW  
How about $50 for the handsome pair
BTW found a few other weird ones like 1300cc and 1500cc also
and a new 40hp head


Always making room for more 36hp stuff


while I am on a roll, found a 1968-73? POP TOP tent in a box, still new
$150   a few cots  also
