Subject: Fw: [T2] Engine woes

I wasn't blaming AVP necessarily and I know it is/was a design flaw, but I'm
not really happy with AVP and their heads as I know I've lost compression in
#3 and when rooting around looking for the current problem, found media blast
fragments inside the engine case.  Appreciate your advice and how to get a fix
on it, but I just want to get a reliable engine together that I don't have to
constantly worry about.
