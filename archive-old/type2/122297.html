Yep. A week is plenty of time for one of more lifters to bleed down. On my
bus they pump up after a weeks sleep in about 10 seconds or less.

&gt; Or should I first pull off the valve
&gt; covers and inspect the valvetrain?  Or am I just being too paranoid?
&gt; :-)

You could do that but you'll really need to remove the lifter from the bore
in order to determine it's the part that's out of adjustment.

I've got some sounds to share...

This clip was taken after the bus was fired up after sitting for 4 years.
You can hear the stuck lifters but it's hard to over the muffler that has a
gaping hole in the middle. We brought the bus to life using starter fluid
and new gas after replacing the fuel lines and making 7-10 attempts to get
the bus to run on it's own after the starter fluid was consumed. It was cold
in January when we did this and it's quite amazing how the engine finds it's
rhythm and starts to idle so soon.

This next clip was taken 6 weeks later after the engine was removed to
access the clogged gas tank and installed back along with a new muffler. The
ticking noises from the lifters that stuck over the 4 years are more
pronounced in this clip. When is there is lifter noise and I put my ear to
the intake vents the engine no longer sounds like big sewing machine.
