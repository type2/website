Subject: Re: [T2] need idle advice

Your  air flow may have been bad to getting worse all the time.  Now you 
may need to take it to a shop to get the CO screw set correctly.  You 
may be running way to lean or way to rich.  Way to lean very bad on 
valves. I had worked with enough FI systems that even though i knew i 
had both a bad double relay and a bad air flow On my recently aquired 
Westy, I sent it to a shop that i use for the stuff i dont have the 
equip for.  The new one when installed almost ran but not quite, until 
adjusted with the tester.   BTW how to mess up a tech. (not nice but 
fun)  signal shop manager and put good double relay in pocket and bad 
double relay back in when he tries to set the CO.

&gt; I tested the intake air meter today per bentley and found 2 specs that

&gt; Now the bus slows until it dies even if it is warm--unless I keep it

&gt; with the pedal.
&gt; How to make a bus idle so it does not require three feet at the stop
&gt; signs??? Oh, it also takes a lot of turning at startup...NEVER EVER 
&gt; fires
&gt; the first time...not in the 11 yrs I've owned it. Installed the bosch

&gt; kit which didn't help.
&gt; Any help appreciated if this condition rings a bell with you!
