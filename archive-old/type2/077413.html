&gt; Help!
&gt;
&gt; I recently replaced my windshield on my 71 bus.  I welded the usual
&gt; rusted-out area at the lower edge of the windshield, then put in a
&gt; brand new windshield with a brand new seal.  This evening, after about
&gt; 1 hour of light rain, I went out to my bus and, to my horror,
&gt; discovered about 1/4&quot; of water pooled on the dash board along the

The seal isnt sealing.  very typical, even on professional installations.

The only thing I've found to fix it is (yeah, some people swear by tar.
ug.) to take a nice tube of black silicone, feed it in the calk gun, take
a nonmarring something (little white plastic sticks are nice..), and lift
the edge of the seal.  cut the tip on the tube for a small bead, slide the
tip under the seal...and squeeze.  follow that white stick all the way
around the seal, getting the silicone way down under there as best you
can.

Now, clean it up, even back up under the lip of the seal a bit..you dont
want to glue that outer edge down, i suppose.

Remember, you want the silicone UNDER the seal, not above it!!!

I'm sure anyone that tries to replace a windshield after me hates me...but
damned if I've found any other way to stop the underdash downpour that
goes along with a brand new (but not german) seal.
