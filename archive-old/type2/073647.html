Subject: 1979 Turn signal Mechanism wanted

Hi Volks,

The cuff of my coat sleeve caught on the turn-signal lever of my 79
Westfakia this past weekend, and before I knew it the innards were busted in
two places. The metal arm is no more. :^(

Anyone have a 1979 turn-signal assembly in good working order they want to
sell?  Early bays have a clam-shell assembly that attaches across the
steering column into the wiper arm. This ISN'T that part. The 1979 arm is
integrated into the column below the steering wheel. And wouldn't you know
it, I have access to a 73 column... I'm just not all that interested in
swapping the works if I can avoid it.

Right now I have the whole works removed, so when I need to make a turn I
put on the 4-ways and get into hand signals. I need to get this repaired
before the bus goes to sleep for the winter, along with a new set of rear
wheel cylinders. Once that's in place it should be all ready to roll for
EveryBus 2002.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
