Subject: [T2] How to test engine??

Get one of those cheapy engine start kits from Harbor Freight Tools. They
are about 6 o 7 bucks. You just need the engine on the tranny (so you can
use the starter), a battery, and fuel supplied to the fuel pump. The little
cheapy starter kit replaces the ignition switch.

&gt;Allright Y'all, I have a 1600 DP engine I want to test. I also have a 66
Kombi with starter present but all
&gt;other electrical is really screwy (or screwed up, I don't know yet.)
Anyway, I put the engine in the 66 to 
&gt;test it but can't seem to figure out how I can start it up. There is no
key, no ignition switch, and the 
&gt;wiring up front in the cab is a spagetti twisted mess. The engine has an
alternator conversion with built in 
&gt;regulator. Is there a way I can wire the battery directly to the starter or
alternator just to get the engine 
&gt;started to see if it runs?
