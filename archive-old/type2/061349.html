Chad:

The number is 211 405 129A

I think that defines a set of four, and the &quot;A&quot; differentiates the
'68-on from the pre-'68.

I encourage you to call around - Bus Depot, Bus Boys, VeeDub, RMMW, etc.
and see if you can get 'em mail order - just because of that smart-ass
dealer.  Man, stories like that really p*ss me off.
