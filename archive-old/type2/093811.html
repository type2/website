Subject: Need help insuring Westy in Texas

--part1_82.20dbdb43.2ab28524_boundary

Hey, y'all...

...about 3 weeks ago I got a letter from my insurance carrier, Allstate, 
telling me that they weren't going to renew my policy with Allstate Property 
and Casualty &quot;because Property and Casualty has been losing money in Texas 
and we can't raise our rates because of the awful regulators&quot;, blah blah blah 
 - 

...so, to show their appreciation, they're wanting to throw me and the rest 
of their &quot;valued customers&quot; into their (unregulated/high risk) county mutual, 
and, in my case, bend me over to the tune of a 43% rate increase on my two 
vehicles, with no more defensive driving discount...  and this after I've 
given them my business for 20+ years...  Both my partner and I are 50, with 
no accidents/violations on our records. 

I've been trying to find insurance with other carriers, and while I've gotten 
quotes on my '89 S-10 Blazer (significantly lower than Allstate), I'm having 
trouble getting quotes on our '76 T2 Westy, and I'm afraid if I can't insure 
both together I'll end up paying as much as I would pay Allstate due to not 
being able to take a multiple vehicle discount.   One agent told me yesterday 
that our Westy didn't qualify as a personal auto because it has a sink, 
stove, refrigerator, etc., but it also doesn't qualify as an RV because it 
doesn't have a permanently installed, plumbed toilet - she advised me to stay 
with Allstate and take the reaming.

Can any of you (preferably in Texas - we live in Austin) tell me how you have 
your Westies insured, and (again, preferably in Texas), can any of you refer 
me to a decent company that won't gouge me?

Still (somewhat) hopeful in Austin
