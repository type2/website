I have a diz that I'd like to use on my newly rebuilt engine.  However, I
am Bentley-clakkenged, and have not been able to find any other info on
this diz in the archives.

The Bosch p/n is 231 167 049.

It looks amazingly like the revered &quot;205&quot; that comes stock on '71 busses,
what with the xtra big vacuum advance/retard biscuit on the side...

RMMW catalog lists it as a '71 beetle diz, MT and AT.

Anybody got any info on how close this is to the stock '71 unit, and if I
should use it on my bus?  Will it be an improvement over the crap-ball 009
that's on there now?  Do I have to use the retard feature?  WHy is the sky
blue?  Can ducks eat oranges?

Many, many questions.  TIA!
