Great description.

One thing I like about L-Jet is that it's just on the latter side of modern fuel injection.

Look into any european modern vehicle and you'll see a black intake boot made form similar material with similar accordian pleats. Of course, many aren't in the tight s-shape of 75-79 bus but they are essentially the same.

The engine bay is faily airy compared to other makes which may in fact counter the hot running air-cooled engine. The lifespan of the boot may depend on the shape more than the material it's made from considering that the cracks are usually in pleats.

So given that plastics have probably improved since 1975, can anyone state whether or not the durability of the boot can be improved without changing the shape?

I'm not sure if a modern boot has the PP, PS etc recycling code on it to give a clue to its composition but many plastic/rubber parts on engines do.
