&gt;So my ALT light came on while driviing on the freeway tonight. Very
&gt;light at first, increasing brightness while slowing down and when

That means you've got 12V on one side of the light powered by the battery and several volts less than that on the &quot;ground&quot; side of the bulb coming from D+ (blue wire) on the alternator. If you check D+ at the VR you'll probably see 1-2V or less.

This means that the output from the alternator that the voltage regulator sees is low. Possibilities include:

- bad regulator not reading B+ and powering DF correctly
- battery has become disconnected from alternator
- bad battery or alternator ground
- alternator brushes or slip-rings not making good contact 
- alternator had electrical failure (diodes/rotor/stator)
