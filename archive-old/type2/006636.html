Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Rebuilding...

&quot;top end &quot; only rebuilds have bitten one too many times....These engines are
approaching their 30th birthdays faster everyday....The only way to do it
right is to split the case, main reason being is that the cam starts to
really hurt after you lose some oil pressure to the rod bearings (the  oil
lubes the lobes quite a bit)so the cam wears like mad...take a peek and see
for your self..

Subject: [T2] Engine Rebuilding...


&gt; I need new rings, because my 77 Bus just burns too much oil, when
&gt; accelerating.  I have been told if you just take out the heads, you can
pull
&gt; the pistons out and put new rings in, then close it up.  Probably put new
&gt; bearing in it.  Is this a possibility, or will I have to tear apart my
whole
&gt; engine and replace lots of things?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the help
