&gt; Following Muir's book.  Except that one hole/threads looks to be messed up
&gt; at the beginning.  I tried other plugs and they get a few turns down by
&gt; hand, and then stop.  Tried once with ratchet, but that really did not help.
&gt;
&gt; Do I have to take the head off and get it machined?

Maybe, maybe not.

Sometimes the threads get gunked up.  What you need is a thread chaser
which can be had at a well-equipped auto parts store.  The chaser is a bit
like a tap, but it is designed to clean the threads, not cut new ones.
Put a little oil on the chaser, then thread it in and out, never using
excessive force.  It should clean up the threads without much effort.

If you do this and the threads are still bunged up, you have to get an
insert installed.  This can be done with the head on the engine, but some
like to remove it.

A small dab of anti-sieze on the plug threads is plenty. Be sure to keep
it away from the insulator as it is conductive.  Others will disagree with
me, as it is somewhat a religious subject.
