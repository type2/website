&gt; My 1.8 is leaking exaust from the joint between the head and the heater
&gt; box.  I have four newish never installed metal gaskets.  What other
&gt; products will I need to complete this repair.

I always try to have a couple new studs avaliable, they are cheap
insurance.  Replace any that are questionable or come out of the case.
also use new copper nuts to hold the header on.

be careful that bugger (heat box) is pretty heavy
