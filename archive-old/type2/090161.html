Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Removal Question

[...]
I had to disconnect the oil filter hoses because they penetrated holes that the original owner had cut in the body.  I had to disconnect the cooler hoses for the same reason.  After I disconnected everything and removed the engine (about a three hour job thanks to all the dried out hoses), I threw all this crap in the garbage and went back to stock.  The doghouse is fine and I change my oil every 1000 miles.  No more leaky hoses or fittings to worry about.

&gt;Ok, for those of you with remotely mounted oil coolers and/or oil filters, do you remove these too (still hooked up to the engine) when you pull the engine or do you disconnect the hoses?  I'm curious how other people handle this?  It seems like removing everything in a still-hooked-up condition might be a little more work but would be much cleaner than trying to disconnect the hoses and having oil everywhere.
&gt;
&gt;Any advice? I can take some pictures if you want.
