Subject: Re: My Bus runs, but then dies after a f

Karl von Salzen reminded me one can't clamp off the cold start valve on the
bus without stopping flow to 2 of the cylinders because it is in series,
not tee-ed off.   That's why I post to both the list and questioner- so I
can be doublechecked!
&quot;Perhaps the Bosch manual is refering to an injection system that doen't
have a cold start valve in series?&quot;
   True, the manual refers to a 411 AFC system, showing the CSV teed off
the ring main.  P. 3 of the Bentley manual for the late busses shows a t
off the fuel loop also.  Checked the 78, obviously one would have to either
bypass the cold start with a connector tube between the 2 ends of its
supply (venting presssure first) , or do the pull and watch it under
pressure, probably easier!  Personally, a true hosed t would be easier to
troubleshoot.  MB
