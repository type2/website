Subject: top dead center

hope this one makes sense! the swap of parts from old block to new long
block is going well...when i got my long block it was not set at top
dead center..it already had the distributor drive shaft in it so all i
had to do was swap the dizzy. set my old crankshaft in a similar fashion
to the new long block and swapped the dizzy over clamp and all. once all
was in place and tightened down, i rolled the motor over to tdc and my
rotor was not pointing to #1, sooo according to muir, i just loosen
clamp and rotate dizzy until it IS pointing to # 1 right???? notice all
the question marks! i hope i did this the right way. also in the karma
category, i would like to thank Karl for sending me the hoover piece of
tin and since i am new to the list and vw ownership, about all i can
offer is that we have a great vw only used parts yard called interstate
vw and they have just about whatever one might want. only one
drawback..they know which parts are hard to find..:-) if you are looking
for something let me know.
thanks, brian and the kreeper
 oh yeah almost forgot.. had a dream the other night that busses doubled
as hovercraft hmmm wonder which parts i would need? :-)
