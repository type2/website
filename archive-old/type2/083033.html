David,

Have you tried the 107i?

I would be interested in hearing from anyone about the difference between=

the 107i and the 91.

I am interested in the 91, but am going to use non stock fi(megasquirt).

Has anyone tried the 91 with stock fi?  Is the limitation for this
really that the afm that quits metering past about 4,000 rpm?

Cheers, dave
