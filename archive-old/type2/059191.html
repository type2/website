Subject: Re: disabling valves to stop oil leak

OOPS- replying to myself- I meant remove the pushrods, not pushrod tubes (:

Steve Dolan mentioned it would be a no-no to keep going with a broken valve
or wrist pin flying about- I agree- the sound should give you a clue if
it's still running on 3 cylinders.  A broken valve you should figure out
when you pull the rocker arm to disable the cylinder- you'd find the spring
and valve stem loose, with valve stem pulled into the valve cover?  If it's
still tight then suspect the piston, which indeed would allow a wrist pin
to fly around inside.  The fact that he (Fred) could drive that far
implies a cracked piston or one with the wrist pin still in the rod and
part of skirt?  I suppose if I really cared, I'd pull the 1600 (fairly
easy), take off the head, and remove the piston (if cracked), the rod, and
proceed- but then you'd have low oil pressure from the oil squirting out
the free rod journal supply?   Hmmm- cheaper to join GOOD SAM!  MB
