&gt;I've used cardboard as a template for making floorboard patchs out of
&gt;aluminum sheet metal.  You can fold, crease and trim it to just the right

Pat et al,

I had a 61 Bus that had plywood sheets that were behind the two
front seats.  They had been stained mahogany color and were
great - easy to make, too.  Then, when parked, just pull the
curtain and 'ya got privacy and warmth.  And you could put up
pictures and a couple of small racks or whatever.  Just another
idea.
