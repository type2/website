Snoop,

You cannot rekey the ignition lock cylinder,

make sure you are using the early style key

&gt;I have already cut a key by code.  It didn't work, but just because it 
&gt;didn't work, doesn't mean it is bad.  It is very likely it has already been 
&gt;rekeyed.  I just needed to know if the present key was needed to rekey the 
&gt;cylinder..
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the offer of the cylinder but that would still lead to the same 
&gt; problem I am trying to fix.  We are going for a one key bus.
&gt;
&gt; Looks like I will try impressioning a key and then see if I can take it 
&gt; apart once I have that.  If anyone knows how to take apart the cylinder 
&gt; without the present key, please let me know.
&gt;
