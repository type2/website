Subject: Re:  Sloppy Shifter???

Hey now!

Bite your tongue and watch what you say!!

Some of us girlfriends have successfully pulled, rebuilt and reinstalled 
running engines.

I know I have.

My father is horrible at car maintenance, and we have to take care of a lot 
of stuff for him that he just won't/can't do.  You don't see me (as a woman) 
dissing him (as a man) for this.

Loving and caring for a VW is a state of mind, not gender!

'78 2.0L Westy with newly rebuilt engine
and yes, I did it myself

&gt;BTW, letting girlfriends or others drive VW buses has been known to &gt;lead 
&gt;to engines being run out of oil, overheated and driven faster &gt;than they 
&gt;can take. I've heard too many stories of, it had a tick in &gt;the engine when 
&gt;I got it back.  Beware, check your oil!
&gt;BTW, what year is your bus?
&gt;
