&gt;&gt; &gt; After getting the old pins out, I had to push the

&gt;&gt; &gt; them in enough to have space for the new pads.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Mark, this is a sure sign that the flex lines in the front are swelled
&gt;&gt; shut on the inside.  the pistons should go back in with only moderate
&gt;
&gt;for sure!!

Not for sure. It could be the caliper pucks sticking as well. Do this. Jack
up the front wheels. Push the pedal hard, then jump out and give each front
tire a light spin with the hand. Do they both rotate freely?? If one
doesn't, open the bleeder for a moment then close. Does the wheel now spin
free??? Yes?? You have swelled flex hose. No? You have a sticky caliper. As
the sticky caliper and brake hose both deteriorate with age, if one has
problems the other will have within another month or year. When a closed
fluid system gets contaminated, the whole system is contaminated, and the
only way to insure safe brakes, is rebuild or replace all the hydrolic
parts. If the metal lines show any rust scale, pitting, them too. What you
risk is a sudden failure at the next instance you REALLY NEED TO STOP or
damage anything from a bent bus up to the point of LOST LIVES, your own
included, or worse, you just get bent but your or your neighbors child is
damaged.  

&gt;
&gt;swearing in German makes it easier for the bus to understand.

Bob, will you forward this to the type2 list for me. I cannot get a post
through for some reason, and am ready to get out the German/English cross
reference to pick some choice expletives.
