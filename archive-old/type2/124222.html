Subject: Weber tuning- low power uphill

Where should I look first in a low power uphill situation? Restricted
fuel delviery? I just installed 40 idf and am working out the tuning.

Is 55-56 dwell too much off the ideal? Anyother ideas to look at?&gt;

It is ok on flats, could have more power, and is anemic uphill.
Dizzy is a 009 as usual.
