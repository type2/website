Joe scribbled....

&gt;  She's had a string of
&gt; bad luck and now is fighting a &quot;bucking&quot; bus on the way in.

While i was driving to detroit from Milwaukee...this happened to me around the
start of the IL tollways... wouldn't idle... (try driving a bus through IL
tollways with a bus that won't idle!!)  and the day i left MI i found the
problem... the idle cutoff solenoid had come loose.  check this...  maybe its
loose...or theres a short in the wire?  check your grounds...do you have a good
clean ground on your ground strap?  battery connections clean and solid?  how
about your fuel filter?  is it clean?  Is your fuel pump pumping enough? 3lbs of
pressure should be enough i think?

its bucking between gears?  what about your wheel bearings?  are your brakes
releasing? are your CV joints good?  (a clunking should give that away)

I'm sure theres more...but just some of my thoughts...
