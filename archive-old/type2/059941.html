	Chris,
	We've got a '71 (I think- disk brakes) front axle that
the DPO was going to swap into our '70 single-cab... its yours if
you can get it to you. We live in Oakland CA and I can drive as far
north as Sacramento or as far south as Atwater to deliver it. If 
someone else is going your way they could haul it. 

	Bill
