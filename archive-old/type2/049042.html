Subject: Re: [T2] Westy owner's book?

 [...]


&gt; I found a link a while back to an early-bay-westy owner's book (maybe
72?).
&gt; It was a complete set of scanned pages.  I thought I found it at
type2_dot_com, but I don't see it there now.  Anyone know where it is?  I
searched the archives too, no luck.  It was in a section on a website that
contained lots of publications.
 &gt; Anyone have the same book for 1968?  I'd love a set of YOM books for my
 &gt; glove box, but copies would be fine too.

 Here are the 70 books.......at a different site:
