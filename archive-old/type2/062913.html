Subject: FS:57 Panel &amp; Bay Single Cab

Just got a call from a friend in Milwaukee.  Says he found his
&quot;old van&quot;.  He now drives an Astro, so I'm not sure how much
stock to put in his assessment.  Also, friend may be too strong a
word...just someone I know.

Anyway, his &quot;old van&quot; is apparently a 1957 panel and it's been
sitting for 10 years.  He describes it as no engine, no door
handles, no wheels but from California and no cancer.  I'm three
hours from Milwaukee, have never seen this vehicle, but hate to
see a '57 go to the crusher.  &quot;The lady&quot; wants $200 for it.

Not sure I'm up for another &quot;tow from hell&quot;.

Also, &quot;the lady&quot; has a bay-window single cab, probably shot, no
gates, probably '68-'72.  No known price.

Anyone feeling brave?
