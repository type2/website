Subject: Re: [T2] timing question

At 12:42 PM 4/22/2002, you wrote:
&gt;The bus has been running pretty well, but it would lose a bit of power after
&gt;driving on the freeway for about 20 minutes, and would idle roughly afterwards
&gt;until it cooled off a bit. I found that #3 exhaust and both #4 valves were
&gt;tight, and that probably explains the rough-after-warmup stuff.

Sounds familiar.

&gt;I figured that was fine, and went to set the timing. Muir swears that
&gt;all air-cooled VWs should be statically timed

Muir really didn't know squat about type 4 engines.  Use Bentley as your 
bible instead.

&gt;, yet his timing chart
&gt;shows that my engine should be timed at 10 degrees ATDC at 900rpm.

That's with the vacuum retard hooked up.  Can't set that statically.  If 
you don't have vacuum retard, then you need to set it closer to 7.5 BTDC.

&gt;OK, so
&gt;I get out my trusty timing light that I've been using for 20 years or so.
&gt;Except the timing light is dead. The bus was still rough idling, and
&gt;a couple people who have listened to it mentioned that timing was likely
&gt;an issue.

Timing will not cause an otherwise properly-running motor to run rough 
unless it is way, way out, like +/- 25 degrees from TDC.  Pulling plug 
wires at the distributor will more than likely reveal the real culprit of 
rough idle, which is one or two cylinders not firing.  Think about it - 
timing affects all four cylinders equally, so why should it make the 
difference between a single cylinder firing or not?  Dr. Spock told me 
that.  :)

&gt;So I started reading up on timing in the library, and one article
&gt;said that setting the timing to fastest rpm at idle is usually pretty darn
&gt;close, but perhaps a bit too advanced.

Perhaps is right.  Timing to the fastest idle will put you just shy of 
misfiring, or about 20 degrees BTDC.  Methinks that article should be 
removed from the library (jeez, I hope I didn't write it - I might have 
said something like that ten years ago when I didn't know better).

&gt;So I set it that way and drove around
&gt;a bit.  It wasn't pinging, but since I had advanced it a good 12-15 degrees
&gt;I thought I should probably back it off a wee bit, which I did (3 degrees.)
&gt;
&gt;The bus is running great now, has more power than it's ever had since
&gt;I've owned it, but I'm a little concerned that it may be advanced a bit
&gt;too much.

You are right to be concerned.

&gt;I'll go deal with the timing light issue ASAP, but I may have
&gt;a 250 mile drive to make (all freeway) before I can get to that. Is
&gt;this too scary to do? I can back it off a bit more, but I'm rather enjoying
&gt;the power I suddenly have. :)

If you fill the tank with 93 octane and listen carefully for detonation, 
you will probably be okay, but it couldn't hurt to back the timing off a 
little more.  If you back it off far enough that you notice a loss in 
power, you've gone too far.

&gt;BTW, there were *NO* timing marks on the front of the pulley,

Some don't seem to have the mark - I have a couple in my attic that don't 
have marks.  The ones that do have them, well, they can be difficult to 
see.  The mark is on the part of the pulley that's in FRONT (towards the 
front of the bus) of the fan belt.  Best to find it with the engine off and 
put some whiteout in the notch to make it more visible.
