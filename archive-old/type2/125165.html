Subject: I got the just ordered me some Kadrons was &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[T2] what dual
  carbs for a T4 2. liter

Thanks to every one who replied, I just cruised down to the buggy store and
ordered my new Carbs, a little more to buy them local then online but it's
worth supporting the small local guyes, (besides they promised to help me
adjust them if needed)  I'm so excited they'll be heron Tuesday!!!!!!!!
