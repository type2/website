&gt; Hi Listees;
&gt;    Art Lynch here in Texas attempting (yet) another long distance rescue
&gt; of Nikki Elko.

she has about the worst luck of any VW owner I know.  

&gt;    She's currently on the side of the road, IH 10, west of El Paso,
&gt; Texas, somewhat inside New Mexico (she has no real concept of distance,

boy that is some desolate territory

&gt;    She was experiencing probable distributor problems, backfiring and
&gt; stumbling, and pulled the dizzy to check out the points. The dwell,
&gt; which had been holding steady all the way from HCBF, was suddenly &quot;all
&gt; over the place&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt;    She says the dizzy is &quot;binding&quot; at several points around its
&gt; rotation.
&gt; 
&gt;    I told her I think the dizzy is dying.

probably right
&gt; 
&gt;    She does not have a spare.


if desperate, take the pin out of the bottom of the dizzy, MARK WHICH WAY
IT GOES. then pull the shaft out.  clean it up real good in there and soak
it in heavy gear oil-steal some from tranny if you have to this is just to
get one off the side of the road.  carefully put it back together and
hopefully the heavy weight of the oil will help it run true for a few
dozen miles.

&gt; on her printout (printed April '02) so maybe they can help, though they
&gt; are all upright engine guys, not a type4 among them. Nearest AIRS guy
&gt; with a type4 engine is in Las Cruces NM.

the dizzys can be used they are all close enough to get one out of the
desert.  heck find a .009 at least it will get her home.
