Subject: Re: [T2] towing question

I own a tow dolly and have used it ALOT over the years. I have pulled big 
and small with it.

It works well but be careful.

I like the trailer (if your tow vehicle is big enough) b/c you don't have 
to worry about flat tires on the bus. If you are retrieving a field queen 
bus - old tires make it exciting in the mountains. I don't like blow outs.

The tow bar gives you four old tires to worry about but the bus doesn't 
seem to be so tall and leaning so much in the curves (IMHO) but you now 
have four old tires to worry about and four sets of wheel bearings, etc. to 
worry about.

Lesser of three evils!

The best way is to pay a flatbed truck to get it for you and to deliver it 
but the cost can be prohibitive!

See ya!


&gt;This thread can become like religion with people weighing in on both sides.
&gt;Myself, I've pulled three buses by dolly this year, fresno to Van Is, Oregon
&gt;to Van Is, and from Hope to Van Is. One thing I've found is a dolly pushes
&gt;you and your brakes less than a trailer. Easy to see why,a dolly weighs a
&gt;fraction of the weight of a trailer and a good part of the weight of the
&gt;towed bus is on the ground. One thing I have to worry about that most people
&gt;dont is ferry cost, a dolly is shorter and a whole bunch cheaper to cross
&gt;with. That said, check your load and check your trans fluid and be carefull
&gt;of your downhills and you should be fine.BTW anybody remember the original
&gt;UHaul tow bars that clamped to the bumper, now those were scary!!

&gt; &gt; I've done a few hundred miles with a towdolly.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Disconnect the half-shafts if you like. I didn't but would in the future
&gt;to
&gt; &gt; be sure I don't ruin a tranny. There are things spinning in there that
&gt; &gt; don't normally spin much without the engine running. In other words some
&gt;of
&gt; &gt; those shafts might not get enough lube but what exactly I don't know.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Lastly - be sure your tow vehicle is big and heavy. A bus can start
&gt;pushing
&gt; &gt; you around on downhill slopes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I prefer a flat tow or all four tires off of the ground given my druthers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As far as disconnecting the driveline - it's a 30-45 minute job on a bad
&gt; &gt; day... 1 tool.

&gt; &gt; &gt;I need to tow a 74 bus from Ohio to NC. Assuming I have no

&gt; &gt; &gt;it? I called a rental place, and they said a tow dolly couldn't
&gt; &gt; &gt;be used because the &quot;driveline is too hard to disconnect&quot;. They
&gt; &gt; &gt;suggested a trailer (all 4 wheels off the ground). Yea, nay, bogus,
