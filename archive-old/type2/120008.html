&gt; Huh?   What do you mean by 'crook'?

From Dictionary_dot_com

Crook: adj. Australian

1. Out of order; faulty.
2. Not well; ill.
3. Of poor quality; inferior.
4. Not honest; crooked.

I think that the second definition is the operative one.  any improvment
is a step in the right direction.  My thoughts are with Jerry.
