Subject: Re: [T2] Bentley on CD ROM

I bought it here:

http://bentleypublishers_dot_com/

Richard has a link on his website explaining what the printed
equivalents are. I had real difficulties installing it on WinXP, but
customer service was great. I nearly asked for a refund to exchange
for print editions, but Stan Wohlfarth from NEATO works there, and he
told me there are things on the CD that are not published elsewhere,
so once tech support got me up and running I decided to keep it.

      Just where does one go to obtain this &quot;Bentley on CD ROM&quot;? Is it
 different than the big, green transporter manual?
