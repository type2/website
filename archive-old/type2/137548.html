I like the stock muffler.  A bus cannot sound &quot;studly&quot; IMO and a loud 
exhaust is nothing more than an annoyance to me in a vehicle that I drive 
to work and back and take on long road trips.  I can survive happily 
without the extra 2.1hp I would get from a cheap aftermarket exhaust 
system.  My original stock muffler finally rusted out after 25+ years - I 
replaced it with a Dansk stock-style muffler and I expect close to the same 
lifespan from it as well.  It fits, looks good and is quiet.  That's all I 
require from a bus muffler.
