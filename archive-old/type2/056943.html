Subject: '72-79 Tail Light HOUSINGS avail!
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

For the first time in years, tail light housings for '72-up busses are
available again, and reasonably priced!
If your housings are crumbling like most busses I've seen, this is long
awaited news!

I just got my first shipment, and they look great.  They are made from the
original mold (you can still make out the obscured VW logo), and include the
bulb sockets etc.  They are black rather than gray like the original, but
this is a minor quibble since they are hidden by the lenses anyway.

I had to buy a bunch of them to get a good price, and will offer a special
list member price on the first ten pair sold, in order to recoup some of my
investment.  You must mention list membership to get this price.

They are $25 a pair, or $15 for one.  I also have original style lenses,
also $25/pr or $15 each.  Postage will be roughly $4 to $8 for a pair,
depending on where you live, maybe a buck or so more including the lenses.

If you already have an account with me, you can just e-mail me to order a
pair.  If you don't have an account set up, and want to set one up, call me
at 215-234-VWVW with a blank check handy.  Otherwise you can mail me a check
(4801 Gravel Pike Perkiomenville PA 18074), or I can ship COD ($5 extra).

By the way, I do still have a pair of the '63-71 assemblies available, for
$45/pr including lenses and seals.
