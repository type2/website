&quot;why would they use elastic on these curtains but use rods on the back hatch? just curious. they probably didnt have a reason for it.&quot;

 

It is normal. I'm sure they did have a reason for it, although I don't know for sure what it was. My guess would be that nobody's likely to lean on the back hatch, but metal rods would be uncomfortable to people, and people would be dangerous to metal rods, leaning on them and bending them. May not have been the reason, but it seems plausible to me.
