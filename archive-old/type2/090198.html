This was fascinating!!!  Yes, they are my pictures; yes, the basic
thoughts are mine; but, no, it's not my page.  A while back, I bought a
digital camera and went nuts.  I took pictures of everything I did for a
while, intending on making pages, intending to write a Dolan's manual as a
GPL version of Bentleys.  Well, that never happened, my inherent inertia
overtook me before I even much started.  At the same time, I did put a lot
of the pictures on the web, along with posts on procedures.  A variety of
people wrote me asking if I was gonna write pages and I said &quot;yeah,
someday, when I get a round tuit&quot;  then suggested that *they* write pages
using my pictures.  I think this page may be the result of one of these
generous people actually following thru (which is more than I ever did)

Whoever did this, please step forward and take a bow!  Nice job!!  I
disclaim authorship and give credit to you!  The pics are public domain as
far as I am concerned and facts cannot be copyrighted (only original ideas
can be copyright :-)
