Subject: Heater duct

Hey All,

speaking of heater ducts,
What do you use for replacement??
my old ones are shot.

76 bus - paper &amp; insulated ducts

I put on some flexible metal dryer duct.  I have not insulated it, but I
did'nt like the way they fit.  The ducts were too big for the
vent connections on the bus.

And I couldn't figure anything for the 2 vents at the front &amp; back of
the storage area (inside the bus where the kitchenette or seats would
be).  Those vents are really small diameter.

appreciate any thoughts
