&gt; Got a quick question. I am diagnosing starting problems in a 1971
&gt; campmobile and when I turn the key all I here is a click from the engine
&gt; compartment. Does anyone know what may cause this? Do i have a bad starter?

It could always be a dead battery...

Start by crawling under the right side of the Bus (transmission in neutral,
parking brake set, wheels chocked, key in your pocket) carrying a jumper
wire. Find the starter; it's above the CV halfshaft at the very back of the
transmission and looks like two cans bolted together. The little can has two
wires coming out of it; the fat one goes to the battery and the thin one
goes to the key. Jump these two wires together. If the starter cranks the
engine, there's something wrong in the keyswitch circuit. If the starter
doesn't crank the engine, hit the starter a couple of good ones with a
hammer and try it again. Sometimes that helps.
