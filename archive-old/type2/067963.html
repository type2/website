&gt; What is your fantasy non-stock, modified bus?
I have to change this a bit, as the one I want could be ordered from the
factory, back in '67 if you had the $$$ to do it.
I want a highroof double door standard, with the opera windows around the top
part. I've seen pictures of a hair salon highroof that had the top windows.
Anyway, I want it to then be lovingly converted to a camper by those good
little Westfalia elves, who'll graciously throw in an early 60's tent as well.
Oh, it would be a walkthrough, with a gas heater as well...
:)
Anybody seen one around???
