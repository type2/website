Subject: Re: [T2] RE: hole in tin??


When I put my new head on the other day I noticed a hole in the tin of my
stock FI 2 liter right under the #3intake runner.  hole was obviously
stock or looked that way and was maybe a inch-inch and a quarter in
diameter.  ???? what goes there? any easy way to cover it, has gotta hurt
the #3 cooling

thanks
