Subject: Edisto Freez Yer Toe report

By Chet Fehrmann

Being that I'm writing this, it will kind of be my story of how things
went.  Some of it may be insignificant on the whole, but was a thriller
for my easily-amused self at the time.  No offense if parts of the
experience have been overlooked while writing- I assure you they have
not been forgotten.
It all started on Friday afternoon, with Dave and I running around
getting some last minute things- like gas and stuff.  We met Snoopy,
circled around him a bit, and the headed out to Edisto Beach.  The trip
was smooth the whole way, with only one near incident.  I was following
Snoopy and he saw the turnoff for Edisto a little too late, and my
brakes (or lack there of) had me swerve and pull off to the other side
of the road.  Lucky for Snoopy, because he just fixed his rear end from
a previous misfortune.  Upon arrival to the campsites we made a couple
of minute repairs while waiting for the others.  We let Rayl, my
greyhound, off is leash to run the beach, and he made a long trip of it
until he was a spec in our eyes, then jumped the dunes.  Another lesson
learned in my book.  We found that palm fronds make a good, but short
fire.  Many trips were made to find anything that would burn.  Late that

night Maddog and his wife showed up, and even later Derek came.  It was
cold that night, but it was toasty warm in our busses (at least mine
was).  We woke up to the taste of Mad Uncle Dave's Breakfast Burrito's,
then listened to Dave play his guitar.  Saturday morning Royce, Ben, and

Paige showed up.  We had a lot of fun in the cold just relaxing and
enjoying being out.  My wife Kelly found many cool shells to bring home
with us.  The meals were great- there's always good food at the Full
Moon Bus Club camping trips.  Early Sunday morning we burned the rest of

our wood, and it started to rain.  We all lined up our busses for
pictures, then commenced with preparations to leave.  We carabussed out
of there, and slowly, one by one, the carabus split up and we went our
separate ways until the next camping trip or when someone calls for
help.  That's what I believe bussing's all about.  Happy driving--Chet
