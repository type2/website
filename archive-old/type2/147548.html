Subject: Re: [T2] Green Westy Plaid 4 sale

I felt uneasy being the first one to give my experiences about David here,
so I thank Arnaud for being the first.

I paypaled David $80 for a step and a small welder in early march as well.
 It took until then end of April for me to recieve the parts.

The step turned out to be an aluminum one even though I was expecting a
steel one, that on the surface, seems ok.

The step came bent and not from packaging.  I wil have to take the step to
a frame shop and have it bent back so it will fit into the jack mounting
points.  I have been unsuccessful in trying to bend it myself.  I haven't
tried the small welder yet.

I had to make a paypal complaint it seems to get David to send the parts I
paid for.  Thats a real shame considering I am only 1 day regular UPS
ground from his City (Wilmington, NC).

My facts, no opinions other than the obvious are stated here.

Regards,

Mark

&gt; FYI,
 It took some serious time and
&gt; effort to have it shipped to me (got it April 13th). A fastener was
missing but the cleaner and boot were OK otherwise.
&gt;
&gt; I shared my anxiety about never receiving the parts with another member
on this list who was in the same situation.
&gt;
&gt; This is not a rant nor a flame, just facts

&quot;Nothing in the world is more dangerous than a sincere ignorance and
conscientious stupidity.&quot;
Martin Luther King, Jr.

&quot;The dominion granted to man by the Creator is not an absolute power, nor
can one speak of a freedom to 'use and misuse', or to dispose of things as
one pleases. The limitation imposed from the beginning by the Creator
himself.... shows clearly enough that when it comes to the natural world,
we are subject to not only biological laws, but also to moral ones, which
cannot be violated with impunity.&quot;
Pope John Paul II, The Social Concerns of the Church, 1987

&quot;..To choose life involves rejecting every form of violence: the violence
of poverty and hunger which oppresses so many human beings; the violence
of armed conflict, which does not resolve but only increases divisions and
tensions; the violence of particularly abhorrent weapons such as
anti-personnel mines; the violence of drug trafficking; the violence of
racism; and the violence of mindless damage to the natural environment.&quot;
Pope John Paul II 1999

What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans, and the homeless,
whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism
or the holy name of liberty and democracy?-- Gandhi

&quot;There were not sufficient reasons to unleash a war against Iraq. To say
nothing of the fact that, given the new weapons that make possible
destructions that go beyond the combatant groups, today we should be
asking ourselves if it is still licit to admit the very existence of a
'just war.'&quot;
