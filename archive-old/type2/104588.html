Subject: Alternator/fan tinware Q

Hey y'all
Whilst spending time not at work due to illness, I decided it was time to 
finish the Sp doghouse project, in between bouts with the nasty drugs I was 
given.  Before I just put the new fan on the hub, is there a difference in 
the tinware between fan and alternator?  I don't recall a difference but 
right now my mind's not exactly at it's sharpest...

Mad Uncle Dave
