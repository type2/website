Subject: Is my buss worth working on

Hello

I have a vw buss from 1973.
If I look at the buss from the outside it looks ok. But when I crawl under 
it I found a lot of rust, the problem is that I am not experiensed enugh to 
judge how bad it actually is. That´s why I´m now asking for as much help as 
i can.

I have made a homepage with a lot of pictures on my buss, the adress is: 
http://download.tripodnet.nu:81/Folkes_hemsida/index.htm
The page is in swedish but not the pictures:-)

There are a few things becides the rust that I need to fix on the buss so I 
want to know if the buss is worth working on, or if it´s better to start 
looking for a new one.
I live in Stockholm, Sweden and rust is a big problem here.

Thanks a lot for your help and I hope you understood my poor english.

Regards Johan
