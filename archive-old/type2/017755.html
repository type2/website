Well.....just a few words about the EveryBus Happening in North
Carolina.               

Executive Summary:  IT WAS GREAT!  Lot's of great folks and great talk.
Those who planned to go but didn't....kick yourself in the behind.
Those who just blew it off.....don't make the same mistake next year.

Details:

First...my hat is off to Chris....you put on a class event.  The site
was fantastic.  This park had very nice hiking trails and several small
lakes that people fished (or attempted to fish) in.  The only fish I saw
on a pole belonged to Doc Ric's daughter (or was it her friend?) and
word has it that it was on the pond's bank.....doing a dead fish
routine....and she &quot;caught&quot; it.

Nance and I didn't roll into the park until 2 am or so on Saturday
morning.  I was trying out my new yellow fog lights (I think they give
my 79 westy a distinctive John Lennon look....my wife hates them) so I
blinded Sean Bartnik as we rolled into the campground.  A few other
volks folks were still kicking around the fire so I said a few quick
hellos and hit the bed.

The next morning I awoke to the wonderful sights and sounds of 40 or so
vdub splitties, bays and vanagons and a cool, clear and bright spring
morning backdrop.  It really doesn't get any better.  Over the course of
the day we did the normal vdub routine......visiting with new
and old acquaintances, vdub show and tell, hiking, reading, music
playing, adult beverage consumption, napping, frisbee throwing, etc.  It
was good to see Sean Bartnik, Dave Easterwood, Doc Ric and his Dad (what
a great guy he is......I can't believe he is 85.....I should have asked
for some ID), Mitch Davis, Richard Palmer, Mike Benthin, Kelly (aka
Metalwizard), a couple...no several.... Johns (sorry.._dot_can't remember
last names), door prize Judy, Judy &amp; Don, Gene &amp; Diane, and many others.

On Sunday....most people made their way over to the Farmington VDub
Show.  It was sunny, but the wind was chilly.  The highlight for me at
the show was to meet Jim Thompson of OldVolksHome.  He's out on
&quot;vacation&quot; working VDub shows around the country.  I talked briefly with
him and bought a new water tank pump for my westy (mine crapped out that
weekend).  Jim says he'll be at the Manassas Bugout too.  

Make a note now to attend EveryBus 2000.  Hey Chris....what's the date
for next year?
