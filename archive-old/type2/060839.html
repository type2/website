Subject: &quot;Lets Talk Turkey&quot;

The Nov 15th car show in Phoenix &quot;lets talk turkey&quot; a benefit held by
all the food banks in Phoenix was a great success!!  over 125
turkeys--about 1000lbs of food--and almost $1000 in cash were collected.
just under 190 everything you can think of in cars showed up--most every
VW club in the valley was there.  ABC,AVC,WR,-brought their VWs---and
the Horizontally Opposed VW club handeled the parking and collected the
birds. a 1908 REO --DROVE to the show and was a great hit.  a 1954 Buick
was driven there by the original owner!! food--music--raffles--prizes,
kept everyone happy.  this was the 1st car show that the Phoenix Food
Banks have ever gotten together on, --and they did a great job!! this
show was just part of a 10 day drive to collect 50,000 turkeys for the
food banks.--next year they intend to do it again --bigger and
better--Again many thanks to the Phoenix area food banks for doing a
great event!!
