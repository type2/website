&gt; Exides are standard batteries, right? But you find it worthwhile to

&gt; &gt; I run twin Exide batteries in parallel and have for about 10 years in

I ski, getting up before dawn to get first tracks and hitting the starter
when the bus has sat out in 10below weather all night, I want PLENTY of
juice to crank that baby.,  these Exides are 950CCA batteries. far bigger
than stock, in fact barely fits the space.

as always YMMV
