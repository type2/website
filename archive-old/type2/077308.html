Subject: Re: [T2] heater boxes / part question

Chris, 

I wouldn't be messing around with those &quot;paper tubes&quot; with my 
bare hands if I were you - I did it myself 'till I read somewhere that 
those were made of asbestos - and that material, as you know is 
prone to cause cancer. At the time the buses were assembled it 
was the best heat isolating material around and it's downside 
wasn't yet on the public view. Use a mask too if you're working 
directly under the bus. 

I hope I'm not being too paranoid here!
Greets to all you guys!

&gt; I have been searching for whatever keeps my stock heat from really working
&gt; the way I have heard
&gt; others report it can if everything is both there and connected correctly. I
&gt; replaced those paper tubes and insulated them the best I could, they connect
&gt; down to the heater boxes nice and tightly, but when I pulled the heat sheild
&gt; from the bottom of the motor to continue following them, that metal pipe
&gt; that goes from the heater boxes to the next metal pipe (the part exactly
&gt; underneath the heat sheild) I found these two (on both sides, they appear to
&gt; be exactly the same) pipes to be rather crumbly. There is not any large
&gt; gaping holes in them, but I am pretty sure if I poked it with my finger hard
&gt; enough I could punch a hole right through with little to no effort. If I
&gt; touch them, rust/dust falls from them. In my tracing of this issue, this
&gt; appears to be the only major weak link (starting from the back, moving
&gt; forward anyway. I havent removed the guard under the front of the bus to
&gt; check those connections yet where the heat must travel up into the cab).
&gt; 
&gt; Now, are these pieces known as something in particular, if I was able to
&gt; order them from someone? Or any suggestions on how to fix them/workaround
&gt; replacements for this section?
&gt; 
&gt; It has been raining here in SF the past few days and really cold sitting in
&gt; traffic for an hour just because ppl leave their brains at home when it gets
&gt; a little wet out. I would hate to see a lot of them try and drive back in
&gt; Wisconsin in the middle of winter. Then again, maybe thier suv's would
&gt; finally have some kind of justification. (maybe!)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any help you can pass along....
