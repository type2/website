Subject: Looking 4 engine in Fla.

Hey volks!
          Well yall it has come down to this... I need a new engine for my 74 
westy. I went to my mechanics the other day and did a compression check and # 
2 has 35 compression.  This engine is not worth putting any more money into 
B/C it is an 80 vanagon case  put in by the po. So im looking for an engine 
for my mechanic to rebuild.  I would like to offer up maybe a trade to 
someone for a rebuildable engine. I have a 73 ;parts bus that I've stripped 
down but it has a 1600 an tranny still in it along with other assorted parts. 
I also have a 911 case  and heads i could trade to someone.  So hows bout it 
any takers on one of these? You can have the whole bus if you want I dont 
need it anymore, I just need an engine, soon, it sucks driving on 3 
cylinders!
