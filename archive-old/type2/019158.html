Subject: help engine won't start
Message-ID: &lt;382756AA.F5AEDDC3_at_gte_dot_net&gt;

hello all
	i have a 1600 engine in my 1970 bus. today i decided to not want to
start. one or twice i have been able to get it running for brief periods
of time but however this was short lasted (the engine just konkes out.) 
i am able to get the starter to turn over with no problem, so i don't
think i have a problem with it.  the day b4 today i was having a little
trouble keeping the bus running while i was idling at stop lights. this
makes me think that the prob. maybe with carb adjustments????? but i'm
not sure where to go from here. i can't even get the bus to start to try
any adjustments....

if anyone has any advice comments ect....it would be gladly appreciated/

i thank everyone in advance

later
ericd
