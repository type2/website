Subject: Re: [T2] the canadian border

&gt; They asked us to pull over, then come inside, then sit down and meet with
&gt; some guy that cross examined us. Once we got to the part asking us the
kind
&gt; of car we had, he straight up admitted &quot;oh, well that's why your up here
&gt; seeing me then.&quot;

Well you are in a VW BUS, like it or not they have a bad rep for carrying
people who like kind bud.

- and made some wise cracks about stickers all over the
&gt; back window, etc (hell no!)

What kind of stickers? Dead Head and Pot leaves, or just your average
generic VEE DUB stuff?


&gt; I made a crack about profiling,

They were, you should try living in the SOUTH and owning a bus......

&gt; then, when we thought we were free to go, TWO cops followed us out to the
&gt; bus and went through EVERYTHING. pretty deep to. smelled each of my eleven
&gt; rolls of film (the canisters anyway)

HMMMMMM I wonder why?

&gt; and took a few items inside to make
&gt; sure they were allowed.

Were you carrying illegal BACK BACON???????

&gt;
&gt; all in all, it was terribly annoying, especially knowing they were going
to
&gt; find jack sniff unless they had themselves a dog. and even then, just the
&gt; dog food stuck under the rear bench seat from the PO.

Whenever I get tagged and pulled over I just sit and grin while the cops
&quot;search&quot; for anything illegal in my bus, usually all they find is the mold
in the closet from those wet rags.

I usually wind up talking to the cops for 10 or 15 minutes about things,
usually VEE DUBS and they always let me go on my way.
