&gt; 2.  Now here's the weird one - when I make a left turn and step on the
brake, the turn signal goes all wacky.  It either slows down or stops.
Never happens when I make a right turn.  And it's intermitant as well.
Sometimes the left turn signal works just fine.

I'm having a similar problem, but I think I've got a handle on it.

Sometimes the turn signals will stop working when I hit the brakes.  But I
(finally) figured out that it's due to the battery (brand new) running down
to the point where it can't support both the brake lights and the turn
signals together.

Can't really figure out where the voltage drain is yet.  (Still getting back
into the mechanic thing.)  The only thing I've been able to find is maybe
the voltage regulator is shot.  I had the engine replace recently, and I
trust the mechanic's work, so I can't believe that he'd re-install a bad
alternator.  I've noticed when I shut the lights off at night and rev the
engine the alternator light on the dash dims somewhat, so I'm assuming that
the alternator is working.

When I check it yesterday I noticed that it's only held in place by one
screw, and will turn easily on the remaining screw.  I'm not sure if that
could be the problem, but I'm going out today and replace the missing screw
and tighten up the other one.

I have got to get back into the spirit of this thing!  It's sort of
ridiculous hooking up the battery charger every time I get back from going
out at night. :O)
