Subject: Re: [T2] Starter Recommendation

Be sure to verify voltage drop from batt + to the ignition terminal at the
starter. If poor, clean both ends of both batt cables and don't forget the
aux ground cable at the front tranny mount. If the voltage is still low,
you have resistance in the ignition switch and/or wires, which the relay is
supposed to work around. If good voltage is getting to the starter solinoid
from the ignition switch or relay and the cables are righteous, then the
problem is an old starter that has served it's full tour of duty. 

So get a Bosch Reman. Spend an extra $30 or so and get the SR17X. It's a
whole lot more robust than the SR15X that is stock. It is in fact the same
one that fits the early 911/912 Porsches for not much more money. You must
call around to find out who carries the genuine Bosch products. It is not
the real deal if it does not come in the Bosch corp. box. It will be black
and have the silver ID lable attached and will include the warrenty papers
you will never need.

&gt;I think I will buy a new high quality starter and battery.  Can I get some
&gt;feedback as to what is a good long lasting starter I should purchase (and
&gt;the best place to get one)?
&gt;
&gt;Thank you again.. this list is great,
