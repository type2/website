Subject: Westy for Sale

I'm not sure how much these go for because my Uncle gave this one to me when
he didn't want it.  I was wondering if you guys could tell me how much they go
for normally, and more specifically what mine is worth with the following
description:

Newly re-built engine, two years ago, stock 1600cc single carb, dual ports.

Recently repainted outside, all white, a year ago with only a minor dent on
the sliding and passenger doors.

Original Westphalia interior

CD player, four speakers (two in the front, two in the back)

New tires, and breaks (two years old)

New carpet in the front, new seats with covers, new canvas for the pop top.

Manza (I think thatbs what it is) exhaust, four tipped chrome muffler

There is no canvas for either the bed in the pop top or the one in the front,
but the poles are there.

That's about all I can think of.  Please let me know what you guys think.  The
problem is that I have to move to college, and I need the money, so I was
going to sell this and buy a cheaper car so I can afford to get my first and
last month's rent.  Plus I don't have the money to finish it up, like the
interior, and I want to make sure it goes to a good owner who will have the
means and knowledge to take care of it.
