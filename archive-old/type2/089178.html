Subject: Re: [T2] Do-well:

Everything fails, it's a chance you take. I perfer my &quot;whirly gig&quot; just for
the plain fact that even with a well tuned ignition system with points my
van does not perform as well as it does with the &quot;whirly gig&quot; - plain and
simple. Plus if it EVER fails I carry points with me so I can reinstall them
to help me get home. To each his own I say.
