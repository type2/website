Subject: [T2] JRMBBC II ...last warning

Hello everyone!!!

 Tomorrow is the start of the JRMBBC II at Turner Falls in Oklahoma. I'm
looking forward to seeing allot of buses there!!

To get there: From OKC and points north...I-35 South to exit 51, turn on to
US 77 South, go 1 1/2 miles, entrance on your right.

&gt;From Dallas and points south...Get on I-35 North to exit 47, turn on to US
77 North, go about 3 1/2 miles, entrance on the left.

The cost is $5 per person per day....make certain that you tell the at the
gate that you are with the Josh Rogers group to get the group discount.

See You There!!!!
