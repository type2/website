Subject: Front bumper things?

I have two front bumper things, what are they?
I believe they are for a '67 or earlier.

They fit on the front bumper. they are horizontal about 12&quot; long by about
2.5&quot; high with rubber centers and it looks like aluminum or metal trim.

Anyway i do not need them.
What might they be worth to someone?

thanks
