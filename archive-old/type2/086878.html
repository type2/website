&gt; I agree with most of the stuff you said except the
&gt; young hippie thing. I am 17, have longish hair, and a
&gt; beard, and plenty of dead stickers an my busses. My
&gt; main van that I have had for two years(71 panel) runs
&gt; great and gets a tune up(by me)every three or four
&gt; months and my new bus(74 westy) which had both dead
&gt; and phish stickers and a PO who said his favorite dead
&gt; song was touch of grey, will be great once I do
&gt; something about that out of tune, oil drenched beetle
&gt; engine with no filler plate in there. Another thing
&gt; you should ad to your stats is the number of pieces of
&gt; paraphanilia stashed in the bus for each dead sticker
&gt; on the back.
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; &gt; I have been doing a very UN-scientific, informal
&gt; &gt; sociologocal study over the last few years of
&gt; &gt; Deadheads, bus owners, and other totally trivial
&gt; &gt; stuff.  My findings are as follows:  1) Deadheads in
&gt; &gt; general are NOT bad bus owners, but the younger the
&gt; &gt; bus owner\deadhead, the worse shape they keep their
&gt; &gt; bus in.  2)If you are considering buying a bus from
&gt; &gt; a Deadhead, first ask them what their favorite
&gt; &gt; Grateful Dead song is or which GD song first got
&gt; &gt; them into the scene, If they answer &quot;Touch of Grey&quot;,
&gt; &gt; run away as fast as you possibly can and don't look
&gt; &gt; back. 3)Don't buy a bus from someone with both
&gt; &gt; Grateful Dead stickers AND PHISH stickers in the
&gt; &gt; window, it will almost certainly not have been tuned
&gt; &gt; up in the past year.  4)Don't buy a bus from a
&gt; &gt; Deadhead (or anyone else for that matter) who has
&gt; &gt; advertised the bus as either a &quot;Shaggin Wagon&quot; or a
&gt; &gt; &quot;Hippie Bus&quot; or &quot;Dead Sled&quot;, because they have
&gt; &gt; obviously missed the point. 5) When buying a bus
&gt; &gt; from a Deadhead, you can add five kharma po!
&gt; &gt; ints for every GD Show that the bus has been at, but
&gt; &gt; take away 2 points for every PHISH concert which it
&gt; &gt; has attended.  And lastly 6)When buying a bus from a
&gt; &gt; Deadhead, ask them for a beer, if they offer you a
&gt; &gt; mass produced domestic lite beer, be on your way. 
&gt; &gt; If they give you a nice full bodied micro or good
&gt; &gt; import, start talking about the bus, if they give
&gt; &gt; you a nice Amber Ale that they home-brewed
&gt; &gt; themselves, then take your new bus home and enjoy it
&gt; &gt; for years!!
&gt; &gt; Just 2 cents worth from a rapidly approaching middle
&gt; &gt; age tie-dye wearing deadhead who treats his buses
&gt; &gt; right!!!
