Greetings to everyone.
Well, I have a request. I would like just some basic info on what I can do to
improve my gas mileage. It has  recent tune up last month and it runs well
but I am still not sure I have it running effiecently as it should. My bus
is a 77 and is fuel injected. Any thoughts or ideas would be appericated.
Thank you
Aaron
