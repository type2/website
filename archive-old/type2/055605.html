	Sheesh! Let's watch the malice here, people... a lot of us can't afford
the expensive, highly desireable trinkets that give a bus a certain
originality. I might have two or three tents by now if I had not rescued
an extra bus or two from impending doom...

Are we all so  sensitive here that we can't rib each other bit?  Also note
that I gave reference to the availability of a inexpensive rear tent through
Cabela's.

I sell the new German tents because poeple want them, I go through a lot of
trouble to get these, and I have not yet made any money off this.
