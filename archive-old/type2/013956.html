&gt; &gt;I thought that hooking it up inline with the dizzy vacuum
&gt; &gt;lines would at least give me some &quot;first pass&quot; information on what is
&gt; &gt;going on, but with readings under 5 cm3 of vacuum, either i have a
&gt; &gt;huge leak or this isn't an effective test method.  The only other
&gt; &gt;place I can think of for a vacuum leak would be a carb bushing, or...???
&gt; 
&gt; I don't really understand your readings.  You should have somewhere between 
&gt; 12-18 in. of vacuum at the vacuum retard port (manifold) at idle with 
&gt; everything hooked up.  Don't worry about vacuum advance readings because it 
&gt; is also a function of manifold vacuum (but you shouldn't have any at idle 
&gt; OR WOT).

yeah, i'll give it another go when i get home, but i wasn't getting ANY
vacuum reading on the retard port of the carb.  I guess this would be
an indication of a vacuum leak on the manifold, but i'll try it again
just to verify.

&gt; A trip to the chassis dyno (with wideband O2 sensor hookup) would tell you 
&gt; exactly what is going on with the engine.  Might be worth the 50 bucks to 
&gt; just take it in and have it done.  It will also tell you exactly how much 
&gt; horsepower your bus is putting down to the rear wheels, which is kinda 
&gt; cool.  Mine makes 60.

i might budget that in...:)  I'll see if the shop next store has one.

thanks david!
