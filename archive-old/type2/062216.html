Subject: Re: Help with push rod tubes

&gt; The heads must be taken off in order to get the old tubes out and put the new
&gt; ones in. As far as sealant, all I used and was recommended to use, was the 
&gt; new
&gt; gaskets that come in your basic engine gasket kit. Of course I'm working on a
&gt; '65 not a '80 but the heads should still need to come off. Otherwise how are 
&gt; you
&gt; going to get the push rod tubes out from around the push rods? 

One way of doing it is to remove the rocker arm assembly and pull out the push 
rods leaving the heads just where they are.  Get a new tube, stretch it out just
right, use new gaskets and slip it in.  I understand that this may not work in 
the type IV engines? Is that so?
