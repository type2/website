I just popped open a brand new VDO sensor and at
boiling I got 0.004 / 0.005 with the meter bouncing
between those readings. Near sea level. BTW - where
are you going to mount the sensor so that it will tell
you anything about your engine? If only a single
sensor, better to go to exhaust temp sensor as it will
monitor all 4 and maybe help you catch a problem. -BaH
