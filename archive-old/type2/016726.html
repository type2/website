Subject: FI and Misc.

I pulled the engine (2.0 FI) out of my 78 Westy this weekend.  Had a
great time doing it too.  This is the first engine pull I've ever done.
After disconnecting everything, the motor pulled straight back and then
down.  The fun (interpret with sarcasm) part was removing the exhaust
system.  None of the bolts would turn, so I ground 6 off to remove the
exhaust from the engine.  The muffer shop will dismantle the rest for
$10 with a torch.  I only broke one stud which held the exhaust manifold

on.  To check some of the pictures, check out http://pete.anis_dot_com/vw

Here's is where I can use some help:  There are a bunch of rubber
grommets and seals that have disentigrated over the past 20 years.  Is
is possible to find all of them (e.g. the grommet that protects the
wires as they enter the engine lid to light the license plate)?

The fuel injectors have a 1 inch piece of hose attached to them whose
other end attaches to a piece of metal tubing (fuel line).  Is it
possible to replace this hose.  It appears to have a metal cap attached
to the inector end of the hose.

I inadverdently poked a hole in one of my heat exchangers.  Guess I can
get this welded shut.  Any reason I can't???

keep on busin'...
