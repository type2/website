Subject: Re: [T2] VW Tent question

---- Original Message ----- 
&gt; This cavaet was with a recent posting on the un-named auction site.  Is it
&gt; true (taller on the side that attaches to the VW), or just more work for 
&gt; the
&gt; MythBuster
&gt;
&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;Note: Look closely at the photo and you'll notice that the tent is
&gt; designed to be taller on the side that attaches to the VW. So please pay
&gt; close attention when erecting the poles. The red tape goes to the VW side.
&gt; If not set up correctly you will end up with a lop-sided tent. &quot;&quot;&quot;

AH,, I am not sure it is taller... as the corner seams on my tent are the 
same dimensions...

but I do know that the corners are not 90 deg..

the corner has 2 angles.. the gable, and the eave. wrt the leg

the eave to leg angle on the corners near the bus is less than 90 deg... 
this makes the legs lean ,, from the ground TOWARDS the bus rain gutter.
That makes the leg placement on the ground further away from the bus than if 
the angle was at 90..
I think you can see this in this picture
http://www.village_dot_org/vw/tents/clip1.jpg

once the tent is pulled to the rain gutter,,[drip rail]  the eave poles will 
be horizontal.. the picture sort of shows the eave poles slanting towards 
the ground.

I know most tents corners are NOT factory calirated any more.. so I am not 
sure which is correct.. but the best ones I have seen ,, from the side 
view.. like the picture.. the angle between the leg, and the eave is less 
than 90.. for the corners near the bus

the corners far from the bus are ~ 90 deg.
