Subject: westy options
To: Type 2 LIST &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Hello everyone,

Can anyone tell me what options a 76-79 westy could
come with.  I have seen sales brochures for these
models and the the 77 and 78 brochure dont say
anything about stoves, but I have seen stoves in
busses.  What year were stoves available.  Also the
fridge option, how does it work? AC/DC/LP.  I am going
to go look at a 78 westy it has the sink, stove, but
no fridge?  The owner says their is a cabinet for the
fridge with the vented door and a plug inside for the
fridge.  Was the fridge removable? Is it only
electric? was it just a fridge insert?  What else
would a 78 westy come with curtains, screens etc?

thanks
