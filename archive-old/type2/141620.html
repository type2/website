&gt; Can't get my headlights to work. Tried new bulbs, checked ground wires, no
&gt; help. Does anyone have any ideals. thanks, Bob

Bob ,, are we dealing with a 1967 Bus here,,

If  it is left or right headlight that isn't working,,, try rotating the
fuses,, sometimes the connection is bad at the fuse block....


if NO headlight has power.. check the wiring at the floor switch. and or the
dash switch


The headlight circuit in a 67 is pretty straight forward...
power leaves the battery to the starter,,
from the starter terminal to the fuse panel [does not go thru a fuse yet] no
power here, and nothing works
fuse panel to the headlight on the dash switch, bad connection, or no power
here and both headlamps both elements will not work
dash switch to the floor dimmer switch ,  ditto ,,bad connection, or no
power here and both headlamps both elements will not work
dimmer switch to the fuse panel along 2 circuits now.. high and low, bad
connection here will only effect high *OR* low beams
now it goes thru 4 fuses,,, left high,, left low,, right high , right low
then to the lamps
