That CR-V needs a bath inside and out.

I went to get some dirt on the utility trailer from a construction site and 
spent several minutes sitting almost still spinning the tires - thick, deep 
mud. It did crawl out - not a deficiency of the AWD - just slippery.

Otherwise it is doing a good job of being the family hauler to work and 
school.

Yeah I remember you... &lt;grin&gt;

Know where I might find some cheap Vanagon seats? Still trying to get the 
old Westy back on the road. Still riding the bottom of the priority list 
but progress is being made.

Got the rest of my Corvair conversion parts on hand finally.

See ya. Chris
