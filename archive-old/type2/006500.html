    I just thought I would remind everyone to make sure they know the
dangers of getting lead poising when using lead to do body work. Can't
inhale the fumes or dust, or rub the dust on your skin, change clothing
before going home, etc. READ THE WARRING LABELS very bad stuff!!!
    I worked with an old time body man, he was around before &quot;bondo&quot;, when
all you had was lead. I found it a joy just to watch him work, a true
artist. Lead was expensive, so you had to learn to &quot;hammer it out&quot; instead
of mudding it in. Of course there was a little more steel in the fenders of
the thirties and forties.
