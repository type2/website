Subject: solar charging aux battery...

Listees,

I want to set up an aux battery but want to keep my stock generator as it 
works great and I have a backup gen as well. So I'm thinking about not 
having the engine charge the aux battery at all and primarly use a battery 
charger to charge it up once a week for city driving or pre-trip/shore power 
on trips.

And also use a solar panel charger at all times to keep the juice up as 
well. Has anyone done this, I see them on ebay pretty cheap but not sure 
what to look for.

TIA!

-Daniel
