Subject: Re: [T2] Engine won't turn all the way

Hello Again, And thanks to those who replied.
 
I removed the flywheel, still same results, then
removed the fan, then got things to move again. What I
think happened was I put the belt on before the
flywheel and it put the crank in a bind, so once I put
the flywheel and fan back on and set the endplay so
the crank didn't have any movement and kept everything
in line. Tomorrow I will put the belt on and see what
happens again. Thanks Again, Shawn R.
