Hi Scott,

By adjusted the valves I assume you mean the tappet clearances...

The order of the sparkplug wires on the distributor is irrelevant to a
tappet adjustment in that if the crank is rotated to align the top dead
centre mark with the crank case join then the tappets for either the #1 or
#3 will be in their adjustment position. On looking at a cylinders rocker
arms when its ready to adjust the tappets you will see that the tappet ends
are both in the out position (the other cylinder of the #1, #3 pair will
have 1 tappet end of a rocker arm in and the other one out) on rotating the
crank pulley through 180 degrees you will find the either #2 or #4 tappets
are aligned for adjustment. Repeat rotation, repeat adjustment for the other
of the #1, #3 pair. Repeat rotation, repeat adjustment for the other of the
#2, #4 pair.

If you adjust the wrong set of tappets relative to the position of the crank
on all 4 cylinders its unlikely that you would get the engine to start as
the valve opening and shutting sequence would be really weird. In the
unlikely event that the engine would start it would probably sound really
bad such that you would turn it off straight away.

As you have run the engine OK it would seem unlikely that the tappets are
grossly mal-adjusted.

To confirm your lead position on the distributor (with the engine hot or
cold) once again align the crank pulley TDC mark with the crank case join
and remove the distributor cap and notice which way the rotor arm points -
replace the cap (make sure its the right way round) and see which lead is
above the rotor arm, this will be the #1 or #3 lead.
In a clockwise order from your determined point (as above) the leads should
be in a 1-4-3-2 order.
Confusion can arise due to the non-standard method of numbering the
cylinders which from the front (transmission end) to the back are in a
3-1-4-2 order. This means the front right spark plug is #1, rear right is
#2, front left is #3 and rear left is #4. The front is the end you sit at to
drive and the right is the right relative to sitting in the driving
position.

It is possible to swap two leads over (or leave them off) as even a 1600
will drive (but noticeably impaired) on the flat like that! (Done that -
that's how I know)

Good luck

Hello listies,
I adjusted my valves this morning however I noticed when I was done that the
books distributor-cylinder order and the order of PADME's(71' Westy) where
different, only problem is I didn't notice until after I warmed her up and
readjusted the carb. I was wondering if this is common, and if so can I
continue or do I have to readjust the valves? either way I really don't care
but if I do indeed have to readjust the valves how long do I need to wait
before I can do it due to the engine needing to cool?
Thank you all,
Scott Beaupied
PADME
