Subject: VW-&quot;Bra&quot; for a '71 Bus following stupid accident

I wasn't paying attention and for the first time in over 20 years of
driving a Bus, I whacked the rear of a car that stopped suddenly.  My
fault, totally, completely, unfortunately.  Since I've always driven as if
strapped to the front (which we really are given 20 years of rust to
already thin metal on a design that predates the benefits of products
liability litigation), I am ashamed.   Fortunately, no one was hurt.

Anyway, for some reason that escapes me, I had collision coverage with a
$250 deductable on this daily driver with nearly 300k miles so there are
some insurance benefits to be had.  Of course, the adjuster just called
and said that it would cost $2400 to fix my beast and that was way, way
more than the $1400 fair market value he was generously willing to give
me, but if I want to keep it, he'll give me $925.  I screamed that $1400
will not buy you a '71 with a young engine, rebuilt tranny, new CV boots,
young ball joints, gauges aplenty, lots of love, new brake lines, yadda
yadda yadda.  Further, I opined that the $2400 estimate was inflated with
towning charges and new bumper and all sorts of crap that isn't needed
(they want $38 for the turn signal light and heck, I've got boxes full of
them; and a new bumper? who cares about dings?).  We're going to run
around on this for a while but I suspect that they'll wind up giving me
about $1100 when all is said and done and they have &quot;bought&quot; my Bus for
peanuts and I have &quot;bought&quot; it back by paying the salvage value.  Isn't it
funny when they low-ball you on the fair market value and then in the next
breath tell you how valuable it is to a junk yard?  No, it's not funny.

OK, I'm assuming that with a couple of friends armed with $1100 worth of
beer and steel-toed boots, we can kick out the front panel into some level
of repair.  Problem is that it will always look hideous.  I'll need one of
those stupid-looking bras that are designed to keep bugs from killing the
paint job, even though they remind me of something Grandma might have put
over her new furniture to protect from both stains and the off chance that
anyone might want to enjoy the feel of upholstery (or something Grandpa
might have worn over his face when he starred in those 8mm S&amp;M loops back
in the 50s).

Anyone have one they want to sell that would fit a '71 Bus?  Doesn't have
to be in the greatest condition.  Also, I am going to cut holes in it to
deal with my spare tire mount so if you have already done this, that's OK.
I'm in the L.A. area and will pay UPS shipping, of course.

And never, ever take your eyes off the traffic in front of you.  Ever.
