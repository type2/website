&gt; Thanks to all you kind folks who didn't laugh too hard when it turned out
&gt; that my .086&quot; end float was *without* the flywheel in place :-) I then went
&gt; into the manuals and learned how the end float is controlled, which is what I
&gt; should have done before winding up the list. Sorry, folks.
&gt;
&gt; Engine is a 1.8 L dual carb. Now I have the flywheel on and torqued. The end
&gt; float is .008&quot;, repeatable, checked with a dial indicator.

Don:
I'd leave it alone. I've owned a type 1 motor with .125&quot; before and the big
problem was it would change timing, getting substantially retarded when the
clutch was pushed in. This would slow the motor down and damn near kill it at
stop lights. I drove it for many thousand miles that way! (Eventually took it out
and rebuilt it)
