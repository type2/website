Sean,

Right you are!  I've spoken w/ him a time or two on the phone since the OVH
days.  AFAIK, still on the road. (FWIW, I've always had excellent service from Jim...)

&gt; I think it should be clarified who we are all talking about when we talk
&gt; about Old Volks Home.  Not so long ago there was a gentleman on the list
&gt; named Jim Thompson who had a VW parts business called the Old Volks Home and
&gt; a web site at http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com  This is who I believe Nikki was
&gt; speaking of.  Last I heard Jim took his business on the road and you may see
&gt; him at various shows.  Jim also put up some good tech information,
&gt; especially a nice list of just about every air-cooled VW distributor and its
&gt; specs.
