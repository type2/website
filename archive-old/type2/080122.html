Subject: Re: [T2] front mounted tires.

&gt; I have never seen a nose that wasn't dented from a front mounted tire.

I have a front mounted tire that has been there since before the PO got
the car, more than 5 years in all, and who knows beyond that. There is no
dent on the front of the van. The paint is certainly scratched, but there
is no dent. There sure area lot of other dents though. One day I will fix
all those. :)
