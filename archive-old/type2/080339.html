Subject: Re: [T2] MegaSquirt on the type4

Please keep this info alive on the list (publically). I took a good look 
and plan to start educating myself on this topic and working towards this 
system on my Type IV Beetle and eventually my Corvair powered Westy.

I want to learn all that I can before I jump in.

Hoping to also update the ignition to at least Vanagon standards. The 
Corvair guys have worked out some of the details on adding knock detection 
to the ignition system too to retard the ignition using off the shelf 
parts. I'm seeking details so that I/we might apply it to the VW.

&gt;Hey Edward,
&gt;I think this is a great project and yes, I understand that it's a total
&gt;DIY project, which is fun in my book :)
&gt;
&gt;I have a question, though, on how you plan to integrate the unit into
&gt;your bus.
&gt;
&gt;The unit uses manifold pressure to detect the air flow into the engine,
&gt;correct?  So, for that reason it would replace the AFM.  Do you plan on
&gt;removing the whole AFM assembly and running the S-Tube directly to the
&gt;air filter.  I know there has been discussion before about the fact that
&gt;the AFM itself blocks a significant amount of airflow into the engine
&gt;and I wonder if this would increase power (ever so slightly) and/or
&gt;cause any problems (overheating?).  I guess the extra airflow would be
&gt;accounted for anyways.
&gt;
&gt;Next, I noticed on the megasquirt site that there is the throttle
&gt;positioning sensor.  Are you going to use one of these, or are you only
&gt;going to use the manifold pressure?  I don't know much about manifold
&gt;pressure systems so I'm kinda curious how that all works out...
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Mike
