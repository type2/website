Subject: Unknown gas leak

Hi Volks and Guru's
Today I pulled into a parking lot and looked behind my bus and saw a trail
of something. Got out and looked under my bus and saw a drip of gasoline
from the bottom of the heat exchanger on the passenger side. Formed a 8&quot;
puddle and stopped. Oh, thought I, fuel line problems, even tho they had
been replaced within 6 months. The fuel lines were dry as a bone. No sign of
a leak anywhere else but the heat exchangers.
As I first noticed it after a hard left hand turn, I thought I might have
sprung a leak in the tank filler tube or the tank itself so I went to fill
up as I had a 100 mile trip ahead of me. No leaks.
Drove to my destination (fire extinguisher in hand), checking frequently for
leaks and found none. Drove home with no leaks or even evidence of leaks.
This will drive me nuts (not a drive- a short walk) until I find out the
cause. It is a stock 1600DP in a '71 Westy. Ran fine all the way with no
unusual gauge reading.
Anyone have any ideas or suggestions as to what is going on and where the
gas may have come from? This has got me really worried so any help will be
greatly appreciated. TIA TBear
