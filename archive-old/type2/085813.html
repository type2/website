Subject: Re: [T2] BN4

That's exactly what I've been planning to do with my BN4, actually. I 
haven't yet looked into the practicality of this, but I suppose if somebody 
else did it, I can too. (Famous last words...) My plan is to make one of the 
stock heat levers control both left and right of the stock defroster, and 
the other control the BN4. Or, alternatively, I might leave those levers 
as-is and add another lever that will shunt the BN4 heat into the stock 
pipes for quicker defrosting.

As far as a real switch being preferable, I suppose that's really up to you. 
If you don't want it stock, you might rig something up that's better than 
stock (at least for your own purposes).

&gt;hi  all - i pulled a BN4 gas heater and ducts from a junkyard a few weeks
&gt;ago. it came off a 72 bus. i noticed it did not have a switch, but was
&gt;connected to a heater cable at the instrument panel - the stock
&gt;heater/defrost on off. how can this be? if a switch, part# 411 963 107 C
&gt;were to be available, would it be more preferable than setting it up the
&gt;way i found it? confused, i've never even thought about one of these units
&gt;before... and am still not sure what i'm looking at. THANKS!  - steve
