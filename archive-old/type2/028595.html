John Boyer says:
The next things I would check would be the vacuum lines (especially if you
have one running to the back of the intake manifold) and the exhaust
gaskets. Does it backfire when you back off the throttle? If so then its the
exhaust.

It does not backfire, idles pretty well. Timing is right (about 7 deg BTDC).

Since there are no vacuum lines at all, and since the rough running is
mostly
above 35 mph, I'll next swap out the distributor and plug wires. If that
doesn't
solve it, I'll check the intake manifold for leaks. Other ideas?
