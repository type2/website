Speaking of Mallory, I got a look at the unilite on the weekend. This one fits a Ford Pinto not a VW case but it's basically the same except for the shaft length and gearing at the base.

The body is very well made but quite tall and wide. This version had the vacuum can and I wonder if there would be enough room to clear the Type 4 fan shroud vacuum can or not. Does anyone have one and know?

Second, the spring kits...

There are a limited number of springs and I wonder how you can select spring combos and bend perches to get the curve match the stock curve of a late bus dizzy?

I've always thought of this as a high performance dizzy but the graphs don't show the advance slowing down after 3000 rpm. Say you had a high reving motor that went to 7000 rpm. How would go dial in a little bit of advance as the rpms creep up without hitting the advance stop early because of the steep slope of the advance curve?
