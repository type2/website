Subject: Need to jettison spare bus nose...
Message-ID: &lt;19990526024723.15782.rocketmail_at_web118.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

That's right.  Spare nose.  Originally bought a new
nose clip for my 77 Westy from Bus Depot but clip was
damaged in shipping.  Ron got (I think...hope)
reimbursed by UPS for the damage and shipped me a new
nose which I'm happy to say is now on my bus!!!  
Anyway, I've been using this other clip as a heat
shield for my gas grill but the SO does not have the
same free-standing sculpture tastes as me so it has to
go.  Located in Arlington, VA just off of I-395 and
King St. (Rt 7) for whoever wants it.  

Like I said, this one was damaged in shipping but is
certainly usable.  It got creased in a few spots on
the front which will always be visible no matter what
you do to it.  There were a few spot dings here and
there and the top sides were folded over.  It now has
some surface rust.

I may be going to the Bug Out in Manassas this weekend
but am not sure if I can fit the nose in the bus with
me, SO and 2 kids.  If somebody wants it badly enough
I can probably work something out.

To reiterate, I don't want anything for the nose just
to get rid of it.  If somebody wants to pay for it,
send some $$$ to Bus Depot.

Thanx,

Bob J.
