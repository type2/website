Subject: Re: headlight upgrade

I replaced the stock sealed beams with halogen sealed beams (Sylvania ,
I think) a couple years ago when one of the original lamps burnt out. A
noticeable difference! I love it when I hit a long straightaway and kick
the high beams on, they DO light up the night! And since I'm in a bus,
no problem with overdriving the headlights! I think they were about $14
each. As for the H4 lamps, I had them (Hella) on a '66 bug about  20
years ago. I was working at a VW dealer (parts man) and got a good price
on them, was able to get 6v H4 bulbs, and while it was an improvement,
it was still only 6 volt (squint squint). If ever in that situation
again, I'd convert to 12v. The parts manger had Hellas in his
squareback, they did kick A**!
