The gauge is a VDO dual sender. If you have one please let me know which wire
went where (G or WK to the gauge or idiot lite).  Would the full flow
hoses/oil filter effect this?  How much pressure can be delivered by just the
starter turning the engine?  I'm also using 10W-40, per the sermon for the
breakin oil.  It has been cooler here ~ low 70's for a high.

&gt;         3) The alternator/generator light won't go off unless the the
&gt; generator/alternator is making electricity and charging the battery, ie
&gt; engine is running.

I found the short in the GEN lite at the fuse.  It now functions.  The oil
lite still doesn't work.

&gt;         4) If the original sender with original wiring (?) says no oil
&gt; pressure then I'd be inclined to believe it

The light just didn't come on.  I'm going home in a few minutes to check the
bulb.

 5) Bet you a nickel &quot;G&quot; means &quot;GROUND&quot;, but the person who sold you the
sender ought to be able to tell you. No papers with sender OR gauge?

The instructions show only the connection of the gauge.  No paper work with
the sender.

Thanks.  I'm really getting nervous. I've spent too much time and money on
this engine not to have it run.
