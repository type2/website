Subject: Re: welding?

Dan Morris got the new welder.

I can't speak for Dan's use of argon; I myself don't like it for MIG work. I
have used CO2, argon, C-20 (80%argon,20%CO2),  and Star MIx
(82%argon,15%CO2,3%O) welding VWs with MIGs.

I find the StarMix (local name) works about the best. CO2 is *hotter* and
causes a lot of splatter. The time saved in cleanup is worth the difference
in the price of the gas. You also burn through easier with the CO2 when
welding thin steel. The arch is more stable and you get a good bead form with
the StarMix. IMHO.
