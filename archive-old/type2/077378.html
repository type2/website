Subject: Update on the beast and more on the abused bus.


So, I just visited the beast today. All the rust holes are gone and it's
back to it's sage aka baby poo green color. Next is the new axle beam, an
air flow meter and some mickey mouse things (poptop seal and power
washing, cleaning the seats, etc etc) and it's DONE. My roommate now can't
claim about all the unfinished projects I have since I've finally finished
one. :)

More on the abused bus in Virginia. I've been trying to contact this girl
with no luck. I have this bad feeling that she's going to ignore this
until the scrap heap :( I'll let the folks who emailed me know what the
deal is when i finally contact her.
