They are a brand of a CDI; MSD is another. From an operating standpoint,
they are all the same, with minor differences.

Cons:

MSD: Very voltage sensitive; jump starts can break the unit.
Universal: Slight whine when ignition is on. Because of this, do NOT mount
in passenger               compartment (it's annoying).
Jacob's: the most expensive.

They all work well; we sell the Universal (Tiger CDI) and the Jacob's. All
three work well (compliment) the points replacement units (compufire or
pertronix, for example). These units don't change the ignition power, only
HOW the spark it triggerred. The electronic units never need adjusting as
the miles go on (they don't wear), but some of the pertronix have
experienced hot-failures. Compufires often have a rotor clearance problem
that the Pertronix doesn't have.

There is no clear cut winner in this case, there are pros and cons to every
product.

I use the Tiger or the Jacob's (the MSD is too voltage sensitive for my
liking, and MSD takes their sweet time to repair em').
