[.....]

Hi Volks,
 
 I recently purchased a 72 Kombi with a 1.7. The PO installed an 050 Dist. I
 have no idea what cap and rotor to use on this unit. So far I have replaced
 and adjusted the points. I'm assuming they are pretty much all the same.
New condenser. New Bosch Blue Coil, New plugs and wires. All Bosch.
Initially, I had some very light spark arching in the points.
 
 I have 11.5 Volts to the coil. I have no spark at the plugs, and now have
no spark at the points. I did, however, hook up the battery backwards for
about 30 seconds as the wires were red ground/black hot. After that the Gen.
light came on with the key off. The manual (Blue Bentley) indicates that
this may mean a bad regulator.
 
 My question is:
 
 If the regulator is bad, would this prevent spark at the points? (I still
 have 11.5v at the coil.)
 
 Could I possibly have the wrong Distributor cap and Rotor? It did run with
 the current cap and rotor.
 
 The previous owner indicated that it just died about 300 feet from where it
 sits. 
 
 I have ordered the new regulator, and will try that tomorrow.
 
 Can anyone recommend the correct Bosch cap and rotor part numbers for this
 Distributor?
 
 Which fuse controls juice to the coil?
 
 The distributor was purchased from Claudes Buggies in 1980 and is listed on
 the receipt as an 050 Distributor. Part number 2012
 
 It has compression, and a new set of Webers. I know I'm close. Just not
sure how close. 
 
 Your advice will be much appreciated.
 
 Thanks,
