&gt;
&gt; Consider replacing the whole system with the heat exchangers and muffler
&gt; from the 72-74 or 79-83 Type 2.  These had exhaust manifolds integrated with
&gt; the heat exchangers.
&gt;
&gt; course, you may need to replace some sheet metal in the cooling system under
&gt; there, and there may be differences with the sheet metal heat risers going
&gt; to the flap boxes, and I'm not sure how the 72-74 boxes hook up with the
&gt; alloy cooling shoud.  If anyone knows, I'd be pleased to find out.
