 Hmm, that's the same symptoms I get Jack!

I have a spare pair of carbs that &quot;look&quot; newer than the ones on my engine,
so I'll swap them this weekend and then I can strip down the &quot;old&quot; ones in
the safe knowledge that if I break/lose something then I have a known good
pair on the bus!

BTW how to tell when a carb needs a rebuild when the history isn't known?

I'm heading the other way this week.

My situation: 1600 DP with a 34 PICT-3 and an SVDA distributor. 
Erratic idle and hesitation when one stomps on the pedal. No amount of
tweaking the idle screws or the accelerator pump lever adjuster has given a
satisfactory result.  I know, by the way, that my heat riser tube is
clogged, so icing in humid weather always makes driving the first mile or
two difficult.

After cleaning and rebuilding each of the four 34PICT-3s that I've
accumulated over the years and finding that not one of those will preform, I
stole a carb from my son's 1600,  and this one made my own engine run just
fine.

I am running dual Kadrons on another engine and have never had to adjust
them in three years of driving. So I just bought a set of 34 Solex carbs and
I intend to convert. At a minimum, I won't have to worry about icing in the
manifold.
