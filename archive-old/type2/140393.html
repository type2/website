Subject: oil from breather

I've done 5000 miles on a VEGE reconditioned engine 1600 AD type 1 and have
developed an oil seepage problem I am not talking about vast quantities but
enough to cause concern, it appears to be coming from the oil breather - some
is making it up to the cleaner element causing staining.
All the various connections are tight.
In order to help me eliminate various causes can anybody tell me which way up
the oil baffle plate between generator stand and crankase is supposed to go?

Thanks in advance,

John
