Subject: RE: [T2] tranny whine

&gt;Did you replace the coupler with the &quot;upgraded&quot; polyeurothane (sp?) 
&gt;coupler or the cheap rubber one.  I can tell you from experience that 
&gt;the cheap rubber ones shifts just as well and does NOT transfer nearly 
&gt;as much noise from the tranny through the linkage and into your interior.

&gt;mike - i didn't dive into it much. i fig'd coupler is coupler. my memory
&gt;tells it was opaque so i'm going to suppose it was poly. seriously, coupler
&gt;= noise? can you elaborate please.  - steve

The poly coupler is much harder than the stock rubber one - more like a hard
plastic block.  The rubber acts as a dampener (both for noise and vibration)
whereas the plastic one will transmit all that noise and vibration from your
tranny along the shift linkage and right up the gear shift lever itself.  

Want to try a simple experiment to illustrate this?  Take a pen or pencil
and hold the end of it firmly between your your thumb and forefinger.  Now
tap the other end of it with your fingernail and listen to the sound it
makes.  Now hold the end of the pen solidly against your desk or table with
most of the pen sticking out into space and tap it again.  See how much
louder and ditinct the sound is?  Same thing with the poly vs the rubber
coupler.
