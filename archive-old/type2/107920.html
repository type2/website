Subject: Re: [T2] jerricans

&gt; started looking for a proper can and found one in the &gt;Griot's catalog but
&gt;I'm don't want to pay their insane prices so I started &gt;looking for a
similar
&gt;can. I did locate this seller:

Try Army surplus stores I got three of them used but in good shape for $15.
I got two fuel and nod for water. I cleaned them out real good and put some
fuel tank sealant in them then painted them red for fuel and blue for water
now they are as good as new.
