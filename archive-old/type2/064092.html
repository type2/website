Allow me to share my families' philosophy as I grew up in Sacramento.
&quot;It's a great place to leave!&quot;
With the mountains so close one way and the ocean so close the 
other, and Sacto being so dull, one could leave and not miss 
anything ! There was nothing in Sacto so it was easy to go somewhere 
else.  Now that I think on it, same in Phoenix, AZ.
Living in Seatte was a lot tougher, there was always something going 
on in the metro area to keep one from leaving.  Same thing now that I 
live in the foothills between Sacramento and Lake Tahoe in 
Grass Valley.

&gt; I lived a year in Tahoe and 8 months in S.F. and would have to agree
&gt; that the cental CA valley is among the most &quot;avoided&quot; areas for
&gt; me...That drive from S.F. to Tahoe, even with its short run through Sac
&gt; and Davis areas...YUCK!  And north and south  I-5, agreed...but then
&gt; just a &quot;short&quot; ways off that road are beauties like Mt. Lassen,
&gt; Yosemite, Big Sur...but god how that valley is awful...
