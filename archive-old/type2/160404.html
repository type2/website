Subject: please help... dying at idle again...

Some of you might remember a couple of months back, when I had
problems with my bus ('79 2.0FI with CA emissions) refusing to idle
when warm. That problem was solved (at the time) by replacing the
temp2 sensor in the cylinder head, and all was well for several weeks.
Now, however, the problem has recurred, but with different symptoms.

Basically, the bus will fire up fine hot or cold (for the most part),
and will idle well. However, after a few minutes of driving, the idle
becomes erratic, and attempting to rev the motor only exacerbates the
problem and causes it to die completely. It's at this point that the
bus will be difficult to immediately restart (usually in traffic, of
course), but after less than a minute it starts up fine. Also, the bus
is &quot;bucking&quot; or flat-spotting during exceleration, which is something
it's never done, and trying to rev from low idle produces a sound akin
to a missing cylinder or two. Above a certain point, it smooths out
and runs fine.

Another bus guy and I thought we had the problem solved yesterday; he
unplugged the O2 sensor and the thing ran like a champ. I drove it the
rest of the day yesterday and most of the day today without incident,
until this evening. Then the same symptoms recurred. I've checked for
vacuum leaks and found nothing obvious, and the temp sensor and fuel
filter have less than 1k on them. What else should I be looking for
here? The bus is running great and has plenty of power above a certain
RPM range (I don't have a tach), and sounds perfectly healthy. Any
input or advice is much appreciated, as this is my daily driver! TIA-
