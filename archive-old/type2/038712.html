Subject: Re: something's gone

Don and I put our 1977 Westy into the shop last night with similiar woes.
Alas,
the achilles heel of the bus is valve #3, showing a 0 compression when
checked.
It seems the solution is replacing the entire cylinder head for a tidy sum
of $600.00
(ouch!). We don't have the time nor the tools to embark upon such an
endeavor, so
our friendly mechanic at Rick's VW in OB (San Diego) is handed the task.
From
the information we've been gathering, #3 is a bus problem, due to
overheating of
the valve seat.  If anyone has any suggestions on how to prevent this, we'd
love
to know!  We've been cruising in the bus for about a month with major power
problems.  We changed the plugs, checked the vac hoses (which have a
tendency
to come off), etc., etc., but were ultimately stuck with the above mentioned
repair.

I wish I could give advice on how to NOT get ripped off by a mechanic, but
honestly, we are learning as we go, this is the third shop in San Diego in
the
past year since we acquired our little 'Marigold'.  This shop came well
recommended
so we are keeping our fingers crossed!

Good luck with the 79'!

&gt; So I drive my 79 bus to and from work on Friday, 40 miles. Everything's
&gt; fine, it's
&gt; running sweet. On Saturday I check the oil, it's on low so I add about a
&gt; pint, nothing unusual. I start it up, knock-knock-knock-knock... something
&gt; is
&gt; very wrong. The noise is coming from the drivers side of the engine,
nothing
&gt; is visibly loose, it's something 'internal' (I'm a low tech user if you
&gt; haven't already
&gt; guessed!). It's quite a deep clacking noise. I turn the engine off and
worry
&gt; for a
&gt; while, then start tinkering around.
&gt;
&gt; To cut a long story short, I figured out (by pulling off spark plug cables
&gt; one by
&gt; one) that the engine is running on three cylinders. The cylinder that
isn't
&gt; working
&gt; is the one on the drivers side, towards the back. Also, I noticed that the
&gt; spark
&gt; plug next to it, on the drivers side, has engine oil on it. I didn't
remove
&gt; any of the
&gt; plugs, I'm just looking at the friendly non-sparking end! So now I'm
really
&gt; worried. It's obviously got to go into the shop.
&gt;
&gt; A few questions before I take it in:
&gt; 1. Do you think it's wise to drive it in (2 miles)?
&gt; 2. Is it odd that this happened when I started the engine cold, rather
than
&gt; during
&gt; a long journey?
&gt; 3. Could the knocking noise be caused by the cylinder failing to fire
(i.e.
&gt; is it worth
&gt; me changing the spark plugs and wires before taking it in?).
&gt; 4. The oil on the good plug and cable, it's bad isn't it? You can tell me,
&gt; I'm
&gt; ready for the truth! *sniff*
&gt;
&gt; Thankyou, thankyou, thankyou in advance for your thoughts. I'm hoping your
&gt; input will help me avoid getting ripped off by my mechanic.
&gt;
&gt; Sara.
