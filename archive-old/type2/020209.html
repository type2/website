From someone who lives here...

1.) seal it up.  Any air infusion will negate all attempts at creating warmth.

2.) wire the heater boxes open. If it gets too warm, open a window!

3.) Carry blankets and coats and gloves.

4.) If it's REALLY cold, find one of coleman's catalytic (white gas) heaters.

5.) Hang a blanket behind the seats to enclose the cab.

6.) Carry blankets and coats and gloves.

Electric heat is useless unless one is parked next to an outlet. 

Dress warm.  We use insulated Carharts, wool sweaters and GOOD thermal
drawers. Hooded sweatshirt to protect the neck. Snowmobile suits are
good.  So are motorcycle cold weather suits.
