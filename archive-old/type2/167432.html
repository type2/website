Subject: Brake lights not working

Hey guys,

     My brake lights don't seem to be working. Where is the brake light
&quot;switch&quot;? Is that in the back of the Bus? or the front by the brake pedal? My
wiring was trashed and I've replaced almost all of it, but that still doesn't
seem to be working. I assume that there is a brake switch that completes the
circuit to ground? Or is it positive?


Thanks...
