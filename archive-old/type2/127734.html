Subject: Electrical Issue Continued

THanks to everyone that sent me advice on my problem...I have yet to remedy it but I do have more information that might be of some use to someone with more experience than I. If I let the bus sit for a while, then everything seems to work fine (interior lights, warning lights, headlights). But when I try to turn the engine over, everything dies. Sometimes there is a click (I imagine that is the starter trying to activate). Then the bus acts as if there is not even a battery hooked up to it. Wait a few hours and go back to step one. I tested both batteries and they are both a 12 volts (so i get to return the new one). I live in Texas so I don;t imagine the undercarriage is exposed to any salt. The first time this happened I was able to jump it. I tried jumping it today and nothing happened. Any ideas? I am still clueless.
 
Many thanks,
Colby
