Amos, Ken is absolutely correct. Recent personal research (largely through
the list and archives) points to AVP as the current most reputable builder
of stock engines. They have a reputation for engines that are a little low
on power, but a little long on endurance (largely because they build with a
lower compression ratio, reducing heat AND reducing horsepower--you can't
have everything).

You might also check out the AVP engine prices at
http://www.sacbiz_dot_com/avp/engines.htm and perhaps consider purchasing
directly from them. I know Ron (at Bus Depot) would rather sell you one and
make his $3.00 on the purchase, but this will give you another option.

I have rebuilt about 5 engines now, including 4 1600s and a hybrid 2.0
liter. I'm about to purchase an AVP 1800 because I don't have the time to
build another one and my engine has spat a oil galley plug, requiring case
splitting for proper repair...that and I've got a problem with one of my
heads which will require more work and more time than I can spare right now.

Point is, lots of people who know how to build their own engines have
learned (in my case through the school of scuffed elbows) that they can't
do it as cost-effectively as those who do it often and in quantity. Don't
get me wrong, you SHOULD definitely build 2 or 3 engines...just not when
you're trying to get it done with the fewest dollars or in the shortest
time. Although you can, with patience and persistence, turn out a better
quality engine than a mass-market rebuilder, I'd refer you to an ancient
mechanic who once told me, encouragingly, &quot;you've got to build 3 to drive
one.&quot; His point was that few people really get it right the first time around.

BTW, with a hole in a piston, don't expect to get much (if any) of the core
fee back; the engine will be too damaged...and good condition engines don't
usually get holey pistons. With that $aid, were I in your shoes, I'd go the
extra money to buy a new Mexican engine from someone. Since I need a Type 4
engine for my bus, I'm *not* in your shoes, so a rebuild from a reputable
builder is in order. (Local shops want more than AVP and come with less
reputation; otherwise, I'd seek local assistance.)

Good luck! Joe

&gt;No, you shouldn't do that. Amos, I'm sorry, but you cannot rebuild a Type I
&gt;for $300 and have it run for more than a week--much less add dubious
&gt;&quot;performance&quot; mods to drive up the price and shorten the lifespan.
