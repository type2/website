Hmmm... that's where John got the ones I am running.  Check a couple
places and ask about injectors for an '82 Vanagon.  They are the same
injectors and a lot of places are dropping '80 and before under some sort
of 20-year rule on old parts.

&gt; About cleaning the current injectors.  Is this
&gt; possible? any commercial places do it?  What about
&gt; rebuilt injectors?  Is this a reasonable alternative?

Well, if you do a google search of &quot;fuel injector balancing&quot; it will turn
up lots of places.   Generally geared to the racing set and a bit pricy
for me.
