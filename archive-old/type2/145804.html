Subject: Re: [T2] acid rust removal

&gt;Home depot no longer sells it because of liability concerns.
&gt;got my most recent purchase from a brickyard and building supply wholesale
&gt;house

We use it a lot in the marine industry as well, we have it in 1 quart 
bottles.  Is very good at cleaning bronze props and thru-hulls .
