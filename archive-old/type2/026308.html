Subject: Flaps Flap - thermostat regulation
Message-ID: &lt;C51ED84B6F47D211917A0000F8BCBD110155009F_at_zcard00g_dot_ca.nortel_dot_com&gt;

	[Crick, Bill [KAN:0W40-M:EXCH]]  I've also seen my flaps partially
closed on cooler days.
	Another comment about this relentless drive to overcool the engines
- 
	I'd rahter have my engine operating it at the temps it was designed
to run at, 
	that way all the clearances are where they are designed to be. 
	Nothing like having a steel crankshaft that is too small becasue it
has overcooled
	oil running through it rattleing around in a case that has bog holes
becasue it is hot?
	I don't know how sever this effect would be, but know that air
cooled motorcycle engines need much
	sloppier piston/cylinder fits, becasue of the wide range of engine
temps

	Then Ken said:   
&gt; I do too, and it would surprise me if it worked that way with a thermostat
&gt; as well. The (limited) experiments we did with VW thermostats argued that
&gt; they depend for their opening on the boiling point of some sort of alcohol
&gt; which is inside the bellows, and open/closed is pretty much a binary state
&gt; with the thermostat. It cannot be made to sustain a half open state,
&gt; although in cold ambient temperatures it might cycle open and
&gt; closed--which
&gt; ought to cause swings in the head temp.

	[Crick, Bill [KAN:0W40-M:EXCH]]  Actually Ken, I believe that it
will sustain half open states, but
	am not sure how to easily explain why. Actually I know this, becasue
Iv'e sat and watched 
	my thermostat slowly ans smoothly contract as it cools off. I've
also heated it with a heat gun, 
	to see if it works OK, and that response is defintely smooth, and
you can hold it not moving
	half open by keeping the heat gun a constant distance from the
thrmostat. . 
	A liquid boils, because its partial pressure exceeds the pressure it
is being subjected to.
	As you heat most (all) liquids, the partial pressure vs temp curve
is a smooth continumumumumum (SP?)
	Now the pressure the VW thermostat liquid is being subjected to is
caused by the bellows springyness 
	being pulled against by the spring trying to open the flaps. If you
heat it slowly, the partial pressure of the liquid will
	increase, and more liquid will evaporate until the pressure of the
gaseous phase is in equilibrium with the 
	partial pressure of the liquid. The change in internal pressure will
allow the bellows to change size, until it is in equilibrium
	with the flaps spring, which shold be pretty linear (Hook's law and
all), so a smooth  progressive response would be 
	what is expected.
	NOTE: The pressure in the thermostat is negative, and it is actually
sucking against the spring, using the difference
	between atmospheric pressure , and internal pressure  acting on the
bellows end caps, and pleats
	to provide the pulling force, but because the air pressure is
relatively constant, and the bellows geometry relatively constant
	this just serves to reverse the sign in the above explaination, and
it seemed easier to explain having it 
	push rather than pull.

	Cheers Bill Crick
