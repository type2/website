Subject: Re: [T2] totally, totally ready for the closet

Stevo,


Whoa,  time to sit back open a cool one and think for a minute.

You knew the dots were there, right?  You checked them not once, but
several times during reassembly....yes, I bet you did.

Last thing you did before closing up the case was to check them again...I 
hope.

Rotate the engine as in normal rotation watching the valves operate and 
where the rotor is.  You know the drill, intake vale opens, you know you 
are sucking fuel and air, when the intake closes you should be close to 
tdc.  Bring the crank around to TDC and see what the rotor points to.

Go slow and think it over.  Tell us what happened.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; so confident i had everything right on the bottom end rebuild [connecting

&gt; last thing. so here i was ready to adjust the valves and install but i ran
&gt; into trouble. dizzy drive gear? sure enough. next morning, today, i
&gt; borrowed one and pulled and properly lined the gear up as per all our
&gt; manuals. dizzy back in and adjust valves.  at TDC with the rotor pointing
&gt; at the cut for #1, and the white mark on the dial at &quot;0&quot; degrees,  only the
&gt; exhaust valve is closed on the first cylinder. is my only remedy reopening
&gt; the case to quadroople check that the dots are lined up?  - steve, spirit
&gt; finally broken.
