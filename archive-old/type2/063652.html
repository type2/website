Subject: Re: Why adjust valves?

The sodium filled valves keep the heads and valve seats cooler; by moving the 
heat from the heads to the valve stems *faster*. The amount of expansion in 
the stems would be about the same;&gt;) VW did this for a while. To my memory, the 
gaps were the same. I have not seen sodium filled valves for a while.

&gt; So this begs the question, would the addition of sodium-filled or
&gt; mercury-filled valves, which have the ability to more efficiently channel
&gt; heat out of the combustion chamber, change the gap between stem and
&gt; adjusting screw?
&gt; 
&gt; I know the answer is probably no, but I'd be interested in why?
