Subject: Re: [T2] fan shroud flaps

&gt; So do these flaps have some sort of spring to hold them closed. From the
 diagrams that I have seen they seem to just ride on a pin that fits through the shroud.
http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/aircoolsystem.html  I cant see how they
 will stop the air flow if they just swing loose.

No springs, no stops, nothing but gravity. Air flow opens them as soon as you start the engine. They are only
there to stop reverse air flow when you run a gas heater up stream and the engine is off.
