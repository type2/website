&gt; In the next year or so I'll need to do some extensive travelling and I'm
&gt; curious to hear from list members if anyone has spent an extended time living
&gt; out of their bus.  I would imagine this is easier to do in a Westy but I'd
&gt; like to know of your experiences in any bus.  

&gt; How long did you live out of your bus?
Travelled for about 4 months in our '76 Riviera Camper.
Lived in our '80 Westi for about 3 months while looking for a job in 
Phoenix AZ.
&gt; What camping equipment did you use?
In the Riviera, used a $400 12v/120/propane fridge as a ice box, and
Coleman stove (no built in), sink with water tank.
In Westi, have ice box again as fridge not work, built in NICE stove &amp; 
sink.
&gt; What about showers and calls of nature?
Used campgrounds for showers about once a week while travelling.
Have a porta potty covered by a cushioned box, well worth it for my 
SO's use and sanity.
Been covered in previous posts, but there are some great cheap 
camping books out there, one of is &quot;Free Camping&quot;, great book.  
One can do a lot of camping and never be in a campground.
