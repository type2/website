Hey All~

I have just recently become the pround and smilin' owner of a beautiful 1974
orange
VW transporter bus (who is in dire need of a valve adjustment and overall
tune-up)..  :O)

Anyway~She's got a double carb engine but I was wanting to ask how to tell
if it's
a 1700 or an 1800??

One other thing, she is needing her engine compartment seal
replaced......this is going to require me dropping the entire engine to get
the seal 'round right?

any advice would warmly be appreciated. :O)

sorry for the naivity of my post but I am still just learning the ropes!

Thank ya kindly,
*Shannon*
and her orange '74 princess
