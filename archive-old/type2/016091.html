Ok, now we know what you are talking about... the support bar...  the
confusion is you said 1970... as there  is nothing different about 1968-1971
engine mounts... the real issue is _Bug engine in Bus_.

A 1974 case may have the bosses... does it have the place for the three
bolts?  If so, you can tap (drill holes) them pretty easily and that would
be the BEST solution.

I suggest you check the archives on the oil pump adapter... mixed issue... I
don't like it, but it does work.

Sorry for the confusion. Now I recollect my parents
getting this engine outta their 1974 beetle and
putting it in the 1971 bus. That's how come the motor
mounts are different. Do you guys recommend using the
after market mounting kits that mout to the oil pump?
