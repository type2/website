Subject: the craziest off-road trip you've taken in your bus

So, I was curious what the craziest offroad trail is that people have 
taken their bus on.  We're talking the standard loaf, 79 and down, 2wd, 
no syncros ;)

Got pix to show?  Let's see 'em!

Can buses get through sand or do they just sink?  Can they handle 
football sized rockbeds?  I guess a bunch depends on the tires, huh? 
There's a camping trip coming up and I'm curious as to what my 78 can 
endure.

later,
Mike
