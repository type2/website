Rob, I recently took the belts out of the back of my 76' Westy and plan on 
giving them the same treatment that worked on my Jeep a couple of years 
back.  Wash them in soapy water, (w/ a brush if needed) rinse, and let them 
dry out completely.  Then take some 303 protectant and wipe a light coat on 
your belts.  This will let them slide easier through the adjuster and give 
them a nice shine.  Make sure to use 303 and not Armor All, as Armor All is 
petroleum based, while 303 is water based...less chance of degrading the 
belts.  Hope this helps
                                                     -Mike

&gt;Hi listees,
&gt;
&gt;Anyone had any luck cleaning the rear seat belts in a bay?  I have the
&gt;originals and they do work, but are VERY hard to adjust.  I give many kids
&gt;rides home from school and they aren't always the same ones in the same
&gt;seats.  I would rather keep the belts that I have if I can make them safe 
&gt;and
&gt;easier to adjust.
&gt;
&gt;As always thanks for the assistance,
&gt;Rob
