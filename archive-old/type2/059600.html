Subject: Re: Idle problem when cold (2 litre / dual Solex)

&gt; When I start my engine (stock everything, dual Solexes) from stone cold,
&gt; it runs OK but has a habit of cutting out at the first couple of
&gt; junctions when I let off the gas.

 I think you need to adjust the chokes to reflect the
colder weather. I'd be interested to see a procedure, or 
advice on how to do this, as I am unsure of how
best to approach it, myself.

Cheers,
              W.
