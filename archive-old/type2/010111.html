&gt;The problem is that I can't align the distributor right because the vacuum
&gt;biscuit runs into the fuel pump and I think it would run into the manifold
&gt;too. This bus has an alternator, so different fuel pump than stock, I don't
&gt;know if that makes a difference.
&gt;
&gt;Has anybody run into this before? Electric fuel pump? Abandon the distributor?

Yes I have.  Last fall I installed an AVP rebuild in my '79 FI stock bus
with stock vacuum advance/idle retard distributor.  Before the rebuild, I
was able to time the engine to spec (5 deg. ATDC) only by rotating (advance
direction) the distributor until the vacuum advance biscuit was up against
the cold start injector.  After the rebuild, I could not time the engine
properly.  When advanced as far as possible (same distributor), with the
biscuit up against the cold start injector, the best I could get was 9
degrees ATDC.  Apparently something somewhere had changed in the lower end. 
The bus ran fine, but was lacking slightly in the raw power department.  I
tried rotating the distributor drive shaft one tooth to get enough advance,
but then I couldn't get enough retard due to the biscuit hitting the fan
housing.  I tried rotating the shaft 180 degrees and that didn't work
either.  Inquiries to AVP, archives and this list, brought no satisfactory
explanation or solution.  I ended up modifying the distributor shaft to
remount the drive dog at the bottom of the shaft such that it was rotated
(advanced) 15 degrees from the original position.  This is the equivalent of
one-half tooth on the distributor drive shaft.  To do this, I had to cut an
new hole for the interference-fit key pin in the bottom of the distributor
shaft at a 90 degree angle from the original hole, along with cutting a new
hole in the drive dog at the appropriate angle.  

I'm not sure its the solution you're looking for, but it seemed like the
best way to keep my engine stock.
