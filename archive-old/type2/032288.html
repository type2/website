ok....after some research, i think ive got this thing pinned.

Code: TO393604
with dual solex carbs PDSIT 2/3

im pretty sure this is a '66 Type 3 1500cc engine....
not a '67 Type 1, like I thought before...


either way, its obvious this is not a type 2 engine, despite how much the
PO insists on it.

Im debating wether or not to put this is my '74 westy. There seems to be a
sudden shortage of pankakes in the area :)

does anyone have experience with these..are most of the parts
interchageable with the '71 bus engine...the exaust system looks similar.

PLEASE PLEASE correct me if you know im wrong...

thanks,
Eddie

'75 Campmobile &quot;Belushi&quot;
'74 Motorless Westy
