Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck Gas Cap

Richard,

Been a long time since I looked at the filler set up on a 68, but i would 
say engine out probably...

If you do destroy it to get it off, use the tin can type approach where 
you literally peel the edges up and go slowly from there....i suspect a 
filler tube would be much harder to replace than the cap.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Dave, everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, pushing in hard was my _first_ reaction, but it's hard to push _and_
&gt; turn it with any force at the same time. Someone at the gas station I was
&gt; stuck at suggested using an oil filter wrench, but, since VWs don't ever
&gt; need those, I don't own that tool. -frown-
&gt; 
&gt; I'm hoping to save the cap as it's original and perfect - I'd rather loose
&gt; the filler neck. Tell me, please: Can I remove the filler neck from the
&gt; outside, or do I have to get into the gas tank compartment (remove
&gt; engine)?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks much,
&gt; Richard
