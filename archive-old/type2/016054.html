Marcus,
	that happened to me once, too. It turned out that the rubber seal
that went between the old filter and the filter screw-in thingy stayed on
the filter screw-in thingy instead of comming off with the filter. So when I
put the new filter on, there were TWO rubber seals.... and it leaked. I was
so mad until I called my friend and he told me to check for the extra seal.
He was right.
