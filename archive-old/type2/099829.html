Subject: Re: [T2] Mix in gas tank

Well--maybe it is something special.

If I am going on a long, hard ride in any of my vehicles, I drop a pint
of Marvel into my gas, in all of my vehicles

It not only lubricates the valve stems and guides it cools them down a
bit to keep them from burning up--

Read the back of a can of Marvel--

Straight oil will do the same---it's just all about how much you dump
into the fue.

Been using Castrol-R in all of my Brit bikes for years to do just the
same thing--works excellent.

Later,

TK

I think your friend is &quot;special&quot;. Putting oil in the gas would do
NOTHING for the engine, the gas is isolated in the area between the
cylinders and the heads, the only place it would come in contact with
anything to lube it would be the intake port guides. The oil would also
effectively lower the octane of the gas, and also lead to nice carbon
buildup in the heads and piston tops. This is a no win situation. I
can't think of anything postive to come of it except minimal lubing of
the intake guide. Courtney

You know... One time somebody told me to put in a little bit of motor
oil with each tank of gas, like a tenth of a quart of oil to a full tank
know that it's good for the engine. It'll help keep it lubricated
better. It may smoke a little.&quot; This guy is really good with VW's, but
