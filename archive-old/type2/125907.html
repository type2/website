&lt;&lt; Yeah, now that I think of it, I'd go the dececant route. Wal-Mart
probably carries the stuff too. I don't think they cost much either.
Like $10 - $20 I think. That or just leave it bare.

Calcium Chloride is the stuff...Small quantities are sold as basement
desiccants (driers) or in large quantities as ice melters...
There's also silica gel (same properties as above) but you've probably
already seen it as the little packets in the packaging of electronics,
or anything else that moisture might harm...
