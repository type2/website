Subject: Re: [T2] CV Joint what is this part called 

&gt;At the end of the CV joint I mean at the very end where it meets the
&gt;transaxle there is a thin metal sort of a dish or bowl that fits into
&gt;the depression in the side of the transaxle where the CV bolts up.
&gt;When i dissasembled mine this piece was dented on one side and missing
&gt;on the other.


Hello Mick,

Is this what your seeing?

http://home_dot_comcast_dot_net/~awisniewski/vw/CVjoint-cap.jpg

I'm sorry I can't answer you question but it does appear that Bentley
VW manual made for this item saying &quot;early models&quot;  Maybe it was 
thought to be unnecessary on later models???  My 77 bus doesn't have
these caps. And a '78 I worked on didn't have these either.

Someone please verify this for me.
Also Mick said in an early post his bus is a '69.

Alex
