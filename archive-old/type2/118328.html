Subject: RE: [T2] speedo repair

Hi Volks- I am a goldsmith.  One of the tools I use is called a
&quot;burnisher&quot;,  which is a curved steel pointed tool. Stick the point
under the rim of the bezel and slide around the bezel (gauge). It will
lift the bezel smoothly.  Then there is a tool called a &quot;bezel roller&quot;
that is half mooned shape that will roll the bezel back into position.
I will be glad to loan each tool to whomever needs it, keeping in mind
that I have one spare of each. Makes bezels a snap...... TBear
