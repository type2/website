&gt; This talk of Waxoyl makes me wonder about what our local mechanic swears

Cosmoline was the stuff that the military used to preserve metal parts
during WWII.  Anyone who has used surplus stuff from that era knows how
tenacious the stuff is, at least for stuff in long-term storage.

As far as situations where the surfaces are exposed to dynamic things like
thrown water and dirt, I don't know how good the stuff is, but for
interior panels it should be great.
