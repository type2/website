Subject: Fwd: Yellow Film - Engine Warm Up!

I think Gerald is from the same generation that
destroyed to Ozone layer.  Why would let your bug
idle so long?  
Why dont you burn a Styrofoam cup while youre at it!
  
 
Im sure in my manual for my bus it says that the
engine should be warm after 1 minute.
