Oops...  Should have read the label.  Yup, says here &quot;Can O' Worms&quot; big as
life.....

First, the cars I drive:

Though the body says '73, the drivetrain is out of the '78 and is a fuel
injected 2L.  It is the same one I been pushing about for quite a while
now (30K on GEX rebuilt engine, 160K on original tranny).

The other, new, one is the '76, also FI, I just bought which is on the
road with me for the first time tonight.  Runs good. (so far :-) but I got
no idea about engine condition yet.

OTOH, what I said is how I have driven all my VW's. Bugs &amp; Busses, 1200's,
1500's, 1600's &amp; 2000's.  I have never felt that 30 in second or 47 in
third is too fast.  It's revved, sure.  But too fast?  Not really.  If I
was forced to cruise between 45 and 55 for any period of time, I don't
know what I would do (probably a really unhappy fourth, but only under
protest).

On lean running downhill:

I may have been less than clear here.  If you just remove your foot from
the throttle as you crest the hill and start heading down, your mix will
go *way* lean and your bus will also start to decelerate from &quot;engine
brake&quot;.  I meant that I lessen the throttle to the point where I am
holding speed.  It probably still gets a bit lean for carbureted engines,
but I was under the impression that fuel mix on FI is independent of
throttle position, that the flap valve and head temp sensor (and O2 sensor
for later cars) would keep the mix from getting too lean. (Opinions,
anyone?)

Driving style is one of those infinitely variable and personal things, so
I am certain there are n+1 opinions out there.  In any event, my core
message is &quot;Keep those RPM's UP! VW's need them. Honest.&quot;

Thanks, Paul, David, Andy.  Nice Volley :-)
