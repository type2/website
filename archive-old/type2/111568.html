&gt; I've tried and tried to get my reverse lights to work, but nothing. The

&gt; back end- years and years of other POs fixes.

I don't have my bay here to check, but there should be a wire coming
off the + (or 15) side of the coil that has a fuse holder in line,
this gives the reverse lights the power, no power, no go :)
