Subject: Better cooling for Type-1?
Mime-Version: 1.0

I felt my single cab was running a little hotter than 
I liked on the highway. The OP switch in my Buscomes on 
between 0.75 and 1 bar whereas the original switch came 
on around 0.45 bar. I knew that it would come on every 
so often when I put it in, yet when I saw it come 
on I wasn't happy with it, I wanted the temp down a little 
so that even at this higher value of the OP switch the light 
would not come on. Going to an additional oil cooler was not 
the thing for me, I do have an HP-1 filter but I am not 
looking forward to having more hoses and an additional 
oilcooler.

I was browsing through the parts catalogs at work while 
thinking about the engine temps in the single cab ...  
and then thought of the fact that Porsche 356s have 
smaller pulleys than a VW. &quot;Hmmmmmmm....&quot; so I ordered the 
parts that make up the generator pulley from Porsche hoping 
they would fit. The idea was to let the alternator and 
cooling fan spin a little faster.

Yesterday I bolted it on and it made me very happy :) It 
bolted right on and I had a few fan belts in different sizes 
to try on. The nice thing about the Porsche pulley is that 
the pulley shims can be used behind the pulley as well so 
the pulley can be aligned with the crank pulley, I didn't 
need any shims behind it, but the flexibillity is there 
when needed. It looks factory, yet it is a clearly visible 
&quot;Porsche touch&quot; as this pulley uses the big 36mm pulley nut 
which threads straight on the existing VW generator or 
alternator. 

Of course I made a few runs on the highway right after, 
pushing the little engine a little bit more than usual. The 
sound of the fan changed, the wirring noise has a higher 
pitch now and the output from the heater has increased noticably. 
I made a 45 minute run at 120 Km/h, that's about 75Mph, stopped, 
looked at the gauge, and the pressure is clearly higher 
than earlier on the same day, even in higher ambient temps. 
Of course it would be nice to back this with data, temperature, 
oil pressure, extra air-volume etc. but I just don't have it. 

This pulley is much nicer than the VW part, it is machined 
in some areas and comes zinc plated, the extra cooling is 
really there, and looking at my little &quot;tests&quot; I am sure 
that some significant data could be logged if someone 
would install this in a bus with nice gauges and logged 
before/after data. More air through the heating system is 
not unwelcome, and a generator/alternator that charges a 
tad better when idling can't be bad either. 

Disadvantages: it costs about $60 in total, you'll need to 
carry an extra 36mm pulley wrench out of the tool kit of a 
356 or 912 Porsche and these are not available through Porsche 
anymore. It will eat some horsepower, I could not detect it 
though, otoh, if the engine compartment is lower in temp you 
might gain some power back there.

I think the parts themselves will be available for as long as 
there are 356s and 912s around. These are the parts you'd need: 

539 09 314      Shim (need 10)
539 09 315      Pulley half
539 09 316      Pulley half
547 09 303      36mm nut
547 09 304      Hub
999 192 200 50  Fan belt, 9.5x888

These parts can be ordered at your local Porsche dealer or 
from one of the many on-line Porsche parts suppliers. 

I am happy with it, and already decided that this pulley 
will be a standard item on any/every type-1 engine I might 
build in the future.


Brian.
