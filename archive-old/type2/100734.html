Attn: Richard Barker:
Well Bessie is always ready for another photo-shoot. But being Way Out here
in Phoenix,  The gig may not work out-- Just last week some visitors from
Germany spent about an hour taking photographs of Bessie--She does have a
lot of friends around the world. Also there are still some original
people in Jerome that were aboard her in her many travels--Bless you and
thanks TWWM, uj
