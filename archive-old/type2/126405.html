Subject: Re: [T2] Back From BusFusion! (Short trip report)

!!!!!

That's something I'd have PAID to ride along to see! 

Can't say I've ever driven clutchless. I freak out when my 3rd gear
grinds going in with the clutch working!

How do you start in gear??? Let the bus roll while you're turning the starter?

&gt; I decided it was best that I would do my best to make the remaining 150
&gt; miles of the trip sans clutch. Precision alignment of engine speed and
&gt; vehicle speed to match a desired gear ratio would be required, but I
&gt; have done this before and the worst traffic was already behind us.
&gt; 
&gt; Starting a bus in 1st gear isn't fun, but it can be done in a pinch. I
&gt; was able to time the traffic lights and plan my route such that I only
&gt; needed to shut the engine off three times... one of those was for fuel
&gt; and another was for a meal stop. The other was unavoidable traffic, but
&gt; it was not a problem to get going again.
