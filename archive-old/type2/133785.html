Subject: RE: [T2] bus

From: Neal
do any of you fellows know any one that converted a bus to a single cab? or
can it even be done


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I know someone in the Full Moon Bus Club by the name of Whitney Yales who is 
building a Crew cab out of one. It was a dormobile. No website that I know 
of, but I might be able to produce his email address to see if he has 
finished it or if he is having problems with it.
