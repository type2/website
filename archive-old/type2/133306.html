&gt; &gt; I got all excited the other week when I read an article in a
&gt; &gt; wheelchair-based magazine about a guy who drove a standard transmission bus
&gt; &gt; with German-made handcontrols.  Calls were made, emails were sent and I
&gt; &gt; tracked him down only to find that the bus was long gone and he had
&gt; &gt; purchased the controls in a tiny machine shop somewhere in Germany in about
&gt; &gt; 1973.  I was being born at about that time.
&gt;
&gt; Hand controls are very hard to get, mostly due to the liability involved
&gt; in their manufacture.

the hand controls made in Europe for manual tranny vehicles are &quot;Gudio
Simplex&quot; (sp) I think they are actually italian do a google or I will dig
up my files
&gt;
&gt; If you can borrow a set of hand controls, they can be reproduced by any
&gt; competent machine shop, for a reasonable price.  Just _don't_ tell them
&gt; what you are doing with all those odd parts they are making for you!

I would buy a set of comercial hand controls, there are 5-6 companies in
the USA that make em, I have &quot;Handicaps Inc&quot; hand controls in my bus and
have been driving it for 12 years or so now, there are some photos in the
2003 Everybus or the 2002 John Browns Buses files.

&gt; I have a friend who had hand controls made this way for his cars and for
&gt; his airplane.  Oddly enough, the airplane was much easier to adapt to hand
&gt; controls!

there are commercial hand controls for just about anything,  check the
website of Paralyzed Veterans of Ameraca they have links to a lot of this
stuff.  www.pva_dot_org.
