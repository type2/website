Hi gang!

Just thought I would add my $.02 worth before this thread gets killed.  The
parrafin/kerosene approach to waterproofing may well indeed work, but this
will make your tent very flammable.  You would basically be making your tent
into a giant candle.  Modern fabrics must pass flame retardant tests so that
they don't support combustion.  They will still burn, but when you take away
the flame source they go out.  If you apply parrafin to a canvas tent IT WILL
BURN!!!!  So, if you decide that this is still the way you want to go please
keep all flame and sparks far away from it!

Thompson's sounds like an economical alternative to the spray stuff that I use
on my ripstop nylon Eureka tent.  Basically it's just a silicone spray that
lets the water run off before it can penetrate.  The tent still &quot;breathes&quot;
after treated.

Sorry for the lack of bus content, but with the camping season at hand all it
would take are a few stray sparks from a campfire to land on a parrafin
treated tent to ruin someone's trip and possiblly their beloved type2.

Happy and safe camping!!
