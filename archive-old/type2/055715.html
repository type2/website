Subject: Eng Running Backwards
Content-Disposition: inline

Hey all,

        I know I posted this a while back but never remember getting any
explanations as to what causes an engine to run backwards after you cut off
the ignition.  Everyone agrees it is indeed dangerous!  

        One explanation is that such intense heat in the heads will ignite
unburned fuel and cause the engine to continue running.  I agree my fuel
shut off is not functioning and letting the fuel continue to enter the
intake.

        I am curious, though, why does the engine run backwards?  I know it
is going backwards because if the transmission is in 1st gear and I let the
clutch out while it is going thru its little routine I get thrown
backwards.

        The phenomenon seems to not be affected by engine temperature (cold
or warmed up) or distributor orientation (I completely replaced it).  '69
SP, SVacAdv 1600.

        Any ideas?

        Josh
