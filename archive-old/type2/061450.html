&gt;  I need help with your summary.  How can it be that a cam which has 0.010
&gt; removed from it ends up having &quot;factory specs&quot;?  What specs? Was not the
&gt; original cam designed to lift a rocker arm by a definite amount?  It
&gt; doesn't seem as though a reground one can possibly do this.
Jack:
Regrinders grind more off the base circle than off the tips of the
lobes. Old time hot rodders were able to grind the base circle
substantially smaller and leave the tips about where they were thereby
gaining quite a bit of lift. I think regrinding now is done mostly to
stock specs or by welding material onto the tips for  higher lifts and
durations. If anyone really wants to know I'll call Web-cam and ask em.
