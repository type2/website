&gt;do you have source for these Brosol Solex Carbs (Brazil?).  Do you recall

&gt;would like to find a pair of new ones.  I am not sure california smog laws  
&gt;will let me change unless they are the same ( are you running these in  
&gt;california?).

I got them from a local parts house that no longer stocks them. I really
can't recommend them. They are somewhat different from the original carbs:
no central idle system and they are jetted to run on methanol. They made my
bus run like a batoutahell but too rich to pass emissions in Seattle. I just
had an expert rework them to pass emissions and he had to do some pretty
serious surgery to get them to work properly. Oh yeah, they don't have a
vacuum port for the retard on the distributer. I have spent as much money
rejetting for emissions as I did on the carbs (~$300).  I recommend finding
someone that can replace the throttle shaft bushings on the original
Solexes--that's the only real obstacle to rebuilding these things.

If you do replace your original carbs, I'd be interested in buying them from
you. I also have a pair of Weber 34ICT carbs that I just rebuilt. We could
work out some sort of trade if you're interested. But, like I said, I
recommend keeping your 74 engine as close to stock as possible, especially
if you are subject to emissions testing.
