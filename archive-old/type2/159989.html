Subject: Re: [T2] Great North American Extreme Bus Race

It's a race, so you don't run 10 hour days and camp every night.  You  
run 20 hour days and sleep in the Z-bed.  Now we're down to a 9 day  
trip.  You can smell the roses on the way home.

&gt; Hi Rob,

&gt; Total Est. Time: 180 hours, 19 minutes
&gt; Total Est. Distance: 10,729 miles
&gt; Breaking the 180 hours into 10-hour days means 18 days travel. Might
&gt; as well plan the trip for 25 days to allow a week of stopover days
&gt; when you need to stop and smell the roses. Sure, it's a race; but is
&gt; it worth missing the once-in-a-lifetime experiences just to win a set
&gt; of tires, etc? Not in my book.
&gt;
&gt; 25 days of road tripping would require another $5,000 in expenses to
&gt; cover camping fees and meals, etc.
...

But seriously, just make if from Key West to Seattle.  Then it's  
doable and easier on the Moose.
