&lt;&lt;  There is often a problem getting them to fit tightly,
 too, especially if they are held on by studs and nus
 rather than wire bails. &gt;&gt;

This was my experience.  I had the aluminum valve covers with two studs.  
they leaked more than the stock ones and were more of a pain to remove and 
install.  They did look nice, but the only time I spent looking at them was 
when I checked them, once again, for leaks.  

When I put the new engine in I cleaned up a pair of stock ones and intalled 
them......Still no leaks 4000 miles later.

For sale: 1 pair of type 4 aluminum valve covers, bolt-on.  (make me an 
offer!)
