&gt;Is there a gasket between the halves of the 77 fan shroud? Is it 
&gt;available or would permatex be a replacement?  Is separating the 
&gt;halves as easy as it looks?(worth it just to degrease?) Thanks!

No gasket.  No permatex.  The halves mate up so well that there is no
appreciable air loss.  

Taking one apart for cleaning is pretty simple - just a bunch of 10mm bolts
and maybe a few sheet metal screws.  When I did mine, I made a simple
drawing of the shroud and marked on it which bolts came out of which holes
so I'd be sure and get the right length ones back in the right places.  Then
I taped my drawing inside my manual so I'd have it for next time.
