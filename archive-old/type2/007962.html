John,
Several years ago my son asked to borrow my '73 Westy, (the pumpkin), to
take a road trip from here in Va.  to southern Mississippi &amp; visit his
in-laws.  They'd been gone about 24 hours when he called to say that they'd
had a break down. I asked what happened &amp; he said &quot;I heard some strange
noises from the motor &amp; didn't know what to do, so I prayed to Jesus &amp; kept
on going.&quot; They were in northern Miss. &amp; some local goober gas station
mechanic said &quot;it done blowed up&quot;.
Well, after they were safely home (by air), my son &amp; I went to rescue the
pumpkin. I borrowed a Ford 3/4 ton crew cab diesel pick up &amp; a tow bar. 
The tow went beautifully, The pumpkin tracked behind that pickup  like an
obiedent puppy. The tow bar was a standard clamp-to-the-bumper type mounted
on a 2&quot; ball on the truck. We were within 60 miles of home when I felt a
shimmy thru the rig in a sharp left turn. I found that the  LF tire on the
pumpkin was low, after inflating all  4  tires to 40 psi I found that she
pulled even easier for that last short leg.
So,  bus towing advice, 1. a heavy tow vehicle (so the bus won't push it
when you brake) 2. a first class tow bar (stop &amp; check the tightness of the
clamps &amp; chains often) 3. check the tire pressures 
The problem with the pumpkin turned out to be the carb gaskets, I had
recently installed dual Dellorto carbs, &amp; apparently the gasket compressed,
allowing an air leak under the right carb &amp; frying the pistons on that
side. Moral; for all our Saviors'  wonderful traits, he's no VW mechanic.
                                                                           
                                    Ron Komoroski                          
                                                                           
                                                             orange '73
Westy w/ penthouse poptop
