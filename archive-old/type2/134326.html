Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trends - Compilation

&gt;    I just got through reading about VW Trends on here.... it's a real 
&gt; shame,
&gt; I was actually JUST considering subscribing to it with some of the money 
&gt; that
&gt; I was going to get back from my tax return.

How are we sure that VW trends in going under?, do we have any evidence 
besides rumor?

Matt
