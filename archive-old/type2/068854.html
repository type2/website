Subject: Bigger bed in 68-73 poptop???

Folks,
        I have a '72 Westy with the little tiny cot of a bed in the poptop.
This thing is painfully small and uncomfortable, basically it sucks.  I'd
love to have a bigger bed up there so when my girlfriend kicks me out of
the lower bed I have someplace decent to sleep (or vice-versa).  Or when I
go fishing with my buddy we don't have to fight for the lower bed!
        Has anyone ever put something bigger up there that will fold up or
be put away so as to allow one to still stand up when the top is popped?
Will the later style beds retrofit?  If yes, where could I get one?  The
cot appears to be easily removable so that probably isn't a problem but I'm
not in a hurry to drill a bunch of holes anywhere to mount the thing (a
couple clean ones maybe but I don't want to get crazy).  Any insight would
be great!

Regards,
Eric Pickering
