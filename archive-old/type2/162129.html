Subject: Re: Missing third (?) cylinder

I was missing on third cylinder with the same symptoms last year.  I  
found that my injector wiring was going bad, and it would lose  
connectivity to the third cylinder after the engine warmed up.
So, check your fuel injector wiring as well.

&gt;
&gt; Could be that the valve seat has separated from the head - at low  
&gt; temps
&gt; no compression - after it warms up perhaps it expands enough to seat.
&gt;
&gt; Have you done compression - cold and hot?  That's probably where you
&gt; should start.
