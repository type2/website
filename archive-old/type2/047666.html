Subject: Re: [T2] Correct Tires (and back window)

That movie was in fact &quot;Electraglide in Blue&quot; in which the blue Electraglide
had about 5 minutes of movie time.  The bus had about a one minute lead on
Robert Blake, who realized he hadn't given back their driver's license and
was trying to catch up with them.  That bus makes two appearances in the
movie.

The PO of my bus bought Firestone F-560  185/70R14 tires in February 99.
Oddly enough he bought 5, the spare being mounted on a bent rim.  I FIND
these tires to be inadequate.  The fact that they are Firestones not
withstanding, they look puny on an otherwise pretty big car, and they seem
to have too much flex.   The 72 Bus I owned years ago had the next higher
sidewall size and it rode a lot nicer than this 76.  I think they were
Pirelli's.

My humble advice is get something a little bigger than 185s.  Just my .02c.

76 Bus
