yeah, and all parts tehy sell now are equal quality to the originals.

&gt; &gt;  Breakdown cover (AA, RAC, AAA etc.) insures against failure.

i dunno about you, but i think carrying spares AND properly maintining
makes the best sense from a financial and convenience perspective.

lets say my ECU on my 82 vnangon goes out in the middle of new mexico.

if i have a spare, i diagnose the problem, pop it in and im back on my way
in 60 minutes. Since i planned ahead i got it at a resonable rate, say
$100

Now lets say i tested my ecu and it was good so i didnt carry a spare.  it
still goes out.  Since i didnt plan ahead i have to wait 2+ hours for a
tow since im in such a remote location.  I have no idea where to get towed
so AAA tows me to some mechanic that charges $35 per day for storage.

Now i am under the gun to find an ecu *NOW*.  Since i didnt plan ahead i
cant scour boneyards and squirrel it away and i end up paying $600 for one
from rmmw AND i have to wait a day while it ships.  If i dont have $600,
im screwed and i have to abandon my van.

yah, carrying spares makes absolutely no sense. 

(i used a vanagon ecu here, but insert any bus specific part that would
most likely have to be shipped from somewhere other than where you broke
down, and that would be more expensive to order than to have scouted out
used ahead of time.  CV joints and carbeurators come to mind. new 34 pict 
$150, good used $50-75 or less  new cv $49.95 good used $15-25 or less.
Plus even if you dont break down, you might make someone elses day....)

peas,

Steve
