&gt; &gt; Be really careful of the little springs that hold the stars in place.
&gt; &gt; If
&gt; &gt; you break them it's and adventure to fix!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; How do you do that, BTW?  My splitty has at least one broken spring,
&gt; with what look like rivets holding it to the adjuster housing.  Is
&gt; there a source for new springs?  Does one then tap the hole and
&gt; locktite a small screw in there, or what?

After reading about the trials of others, I'm really careful!  Solutions
include such things as drilling out the rivets and tapping, welding the
springs to the adjuster block (which must do wonders for the temper of the
metal!) etc.
