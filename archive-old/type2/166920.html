Subject: F.I. problem, won't idle

Suspect: 78 Fuel Injection-
  Problem: With throttle plate at normal fully returned (idle) position and idle screw at any position- including totally open, WON'T IDLE.  Must hold throttle plate slightly more open in order to idle. Idles well and at idle speed when throttle plate held slightly open manually.  It's like with the throttle plate closed even with idle screw totally open, it still is not getting enough air to idle.
   
  Runs well otherwise (lacking a little torque in 3rd and 4th gear), timing is on, advances well, All F. I. components tested (except ECU and harness but it runs well), 2 different throttle bodies tried and 3 different AFM's tried, with same problem.
   
  Ideas? What am I missing? I'm stumped.
   
  Thanks, Chris
