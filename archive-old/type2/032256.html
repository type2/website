&gt; At the VW Classic last week I saw a bus with a type IV engine surrounded 
&gt; by tinware that had the appearance of baked enamel -- like a camper's 
&gt; water kettle. Gray fleck. It was pretty cool. Does it belong to anyone on 

Mark,

I got my tinware powder coated to look like stock, solid black.  They had
a number of color options, including some which were spotted, so maybe it
is just a powder coat job.  Maybe.
