Subject: turn signal trouble

Fellow listmates and esteemed bus pilots,
A few days ago someone wrote in about turn signals not working when they applied the brakes.  I had a similar problem on my 69 and thought that I might find some answers.  My right turn signal would not work when my parking lights were on. The left worked just fine.  With the lights off the right would blink correctly but the left would blink simultaneously,  only faintly.  That was two days ago. I checked grounds, cleaned contacts checked bulbs, everything I could think of.  Now  I have NO turn signals - with parking lights on or off.  My hazards still operate.  If I engage my turn signals, my radio quits working. Turn the switch off and the radio comes back on. I pulled the signal switch out to check for foreign matter and found a loose wire (white with brown stripe) traced it to the headlight relay.  My frustration runs pretty high right now.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
