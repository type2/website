Subject: Re: [T2] Portable DC Heater

Hey there-
&quot;Caframo&quot; makes a reasonably priced,
reasonably effective 12v heater. I don't know Portland very well, but you
can get them online for about $30 at
www.westmarine_dot_com ,(search &quot;ceramic heater&quot;), or from an RV supply.

 I don't want to always sound like an Amp-Nazi, but ever the small 12v
heaters draw over 8amps. Put in two or three, and we are talking a major
load for our anaemic factory charging system, especially if you want happen
to want heat at night when you also want headlights! And that is just while
the engine is running!

Ensure that you have not only sufficient battery capacity (deep-cycle, not
starter battery), but sufficient charging capacity as well. Pmail me if you
want to discuss 12v systems in more detail.
Cheers, and Happy Heating,
Matthew

PS-On my '73 Campmobile, the gas heater is in the engine bay, on the left
side. It fits well.
Cheers!
