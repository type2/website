I always run mine type II westy to about 4k rpm, and in the higher gears to 
almost 5. I have found that I get better fuel consumption( gas mileage ) and 
'blue' seems to like it better. I never run hot, and after 22 years on my bus 
and never a rebuild (she didn't seem to need it with only 125,000 original 
miles on her) she still runs great and has compression ranging from 120 to 
130. your not alone!
