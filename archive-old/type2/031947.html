Subject: Well, let's try a deck height question!
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.91.990508123020.1285A-100000_at_Sherlock.SIMS.Berkeley.EDU&gt;

As someone once said, &quot;a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.&quot;  I 
appreciate that more and more.

In my life I've done 3 or 4 complete or partial rebuilds of engines, 
just trying to be careful and clean, but not necessarily knowing too much 
about the &quot;why&quot; of what I was doing, and not having the tools and 
knowledge to take careful measurements.  All these rebuilds have been 
sucessful.

Now, having read the list for 3 or 4 years, having read Watson's book, 
having amassed a few more measuring tools, I'm having a devil of a time 
doing my two Vanagon engine rebuilds.  That's because although I know a 
lot more than I did, I don't know it all and those &quot;gaps&quot; in knowledge 
are causing difficulties.  Also, I've learned that any source of 
knowledge and information can have flaws, mistakes or omitions, so I'm 
especially cautious.

The question for today is &quot;deck height.&quot;

Watson states that deck height, with the barrel shim in place, should be 
.04&quot; or more.  This is a blanket statement without qualification for 
various &quot;styles&quot; of Volkswage engines.

Measuring the deck heights of one engine (with the standard barrel shims I 
received with the new P&amp;C's) I get .017&quot; and .015&quot; on one side and .017&quot;, 
.024&quot; on the other for an average of .01825&quot;.

Measuring the deck heights on the other engine I get .021&quot; and .022&quot; on 
one side, and .026&quot;, .033&quot; on the other, an average of .0255&quot;.

If I shim these sucker up to something closer to .04&quot; I sure knock my 
compression down, unless I make other adjustments.

So, is Watson wrong about the deck height required for Vanagon engines?

Did the manufacturer of the P&amp;C's send the wrong barrel shims? 

Any ideas, volks? 

Once again, TIA.
