Subject: RE: [T2] &amp;*%^$#$$  Heater Boxes, U-Pipes and exhaust leaks.  
  Gotta be  something better.

&gt; &gt; Except, alas, the stainless muffler. We do have very high
&gt; &gt; quality OEM mufflers in mild steel (MUCH more substantial
&gt; &gt; than any of the aftermarket extractor systems), but the
&gt;  &gt;manufacturer of the stainless ones went belly-up.

&gt; bummer, maybe they were selling it too cheap


Entirely possible. They were a very good deal (nearly the same price as mild
steel). I'd gladly have paid much more to assure ongoing availability. Oh
well, hindsight is 20/20. :-(
