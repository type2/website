Subject: RE: [T2] Troy's engine problem of the day.....Update

While looking for any possible sign of stupid mistakes I may have made,
I found that I was actually able to rotate the rotor by hand in either
direction.  So is it not grabbing down at the bottom of the shaft?  Or
is it supposed to do that?  Thanks.
