Subject: RE: [T2] getting sink to work....?

If you have the old dtyle (mine's a '72, and I'll call that old), its a
hand-pumper sink. The vent is related to the sink's ability to drain
quickly. Considering that later busses didn't have the high vent, I
would argue that the pipe stopping at the counter top should suffice.
Don't forget to check the pea-trap / u-bend for blockage before you get
water in the sink :)
Good luck,

btw, you can get replacement hand-pumpers at a few of the on-line
vendors.

thanks paul..... as far as i can tell this is all out of a 70 bus.... only reaosn i say is i pulled the water tank off and it says 70 campmobile engraved(printed) into the tank...from vw...

so what you are saying is that the pipe should be ok if i dont run it out the top..? its job is just to let the water drain out of the sink faster?

i checked the u trap and it works fine or seems to and no leaks which was a good thing...... the water went out of the sink fast enough for me as well... and would rather not add the pipe to the top of the sink for a vent if i can get by without it? just one more thing sticking up in the way behind pasenger seat,.... but if it has to have it so be it will install it....

i just cant get the faucet to pump the water from the tank....once tank is filled though.. soooooooooooo hmmmmm i know its a basic science but that was never my major lol....that is if the faucet it'self works.. ?

peace and love
