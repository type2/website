&gt;Really, the toughest thing about passing smog every two years is the 
&gt;price of the EGR filter, and the hideous quality of this part.
&gt;
&gt;If the revision passes, I would feel little guilt from installing the 
&gt;EGR system to pass the test, then disconnecting it and storing it for 
&gt;two years.

I'm sure I can get my bus to consistently pass. What I object to wrt your suggestion is the hassle, finding the parts, installing them, removing them, dealing with red tape in future when they aren't available anymore, getting mods/omissions certified by the smog ref, paying the $70 smog fee, multiple trips to the smog test station, etc etc.

This is a hassle that a 75 FI Bus owner doesn't have to endure and I stink up the environment no more than he does.
