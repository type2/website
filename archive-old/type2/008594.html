Subject: re valve noise and hyd lifters
Mime-Version: 1.0

If the noise is occasional and goes away after oil thins (drive, say 15
min), then you likely have lifters bleeding out oil (air comes in) and they
must pump up first.   To me the sound is more of a clatter than a &quot;ticking&quot;
noise, and is heard easily when you put your ear near the valve cover- the
sound of a lifter clattering against the valve stem and itself (as the pist
on in it is pushed up and down).  If the little hole in the side of the
lifter happens to point down this can happen next day; more likely it
happens when you park for a few days.  This happens to me commonly (lifters
have at least 100K on them in an engine with over 199K on it!  (Never
rebuilt, out ONCE to just replace a clutch plate + seal.
  The piston in the lifter has a certain amount of free play (about 2mm as
I recall) and conventional lifter wisdom says to adjust to the center of
this play (hence Bentley's 3 full turns).  Because the engine tends to
reduce valve lash with warming up and valves tend to &quot;stretch&quot; (seat
pounding in or valve burning) more than pushrod, adjustor, and valve ends
seem to wear, people try to get a longer life out of the lifter by using
just one turn.  Personally I believe this can cause stress against the snap
clip that holds the piston in until engine is hot and a valve that doesn't
fully open enough if you only drive short distances in winter!   I check
the lifter adjustment every year- it gives you a good clue if things are
happening to the valve train (keep track of the number of turns to back off
the adjustment to contact point).
