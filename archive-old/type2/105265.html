Subject: Re: [T2] CV Joint noise?

&gt;getting a &quot;horrible&quot; sort if grinding trani sort of noise,

i did a cv job on 2 buses recently, it's hard to imagine that heavy grease 
settling, but.... hard to say until you get into it eh?
maybe last time they were done there wasn't enough extra added to them 
before locking the boots down.

good luck,
m.
