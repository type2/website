&gt; Bob do you mean that the non FI buses do not have the slot/hole for the

both and a few other things like wiring.

&gt; with yours and make 2. Besides the flywheel and the others, the fuel tank
&gt; will not have a return line for the FI system. This can be remedied with a
&gt; few minor fittings that will allow it to work properly. The slot/hole for
&gt; the ECU could be cut into the body if not there, I guess. To answer the
&gt; question is not as easy as black and white. But yes you could &quot;throw&quot; that

Well Gregg just did it and I know others have so it is not impossible.
and if he has two vans or both engines he should be able to put his hands
on all the pieces.

of course short of changing the tranny too he will still have the slower
gear ratios

&gt; IT JUST DEPENDS ON YOUR WIND UP. Think breath release. You can do it.

yup
Bob
