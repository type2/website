Subject: Re: [T2] Starter continues on

Frank,

The ignition switch is most likely hanging &amp;quot;on&amp;quot;.  In other words
you are still supplying power to the starter motor even though
you released the key from the start position.

Wrong wires someplace....get and VOM from radio shack and check it.

Yes, probably wrong wires someplace.

Look at the bentley wiring diagram.

The least you should have at the switch is:

Battery power into the switch.
You should get positive voltage on the starter wire only when the key is 
in &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; position.  When you release it, positive voltage goes away on 
that wire....it will be a &amp;quot;larger&amp;quot; wire.

The other wire should go to your coil and should have positive voltage on
it only when the switch is &amp;quot;on&amp;quot;.

I'm betting that you have the battery feed and the starter wire reversed.

Cheers, dave

&amp;gt; Hey Folks,
&amp;gt; I had a 60 DC with 1600 DP hotwired and taken for a joy ride.  I just got
&amp;gt; the wires re-connected to the ignition switch, and I have power, and it
&amp;gt; starts.  Problem is the starter will not quit once it starts.  This is a new
 issue.  Is it related to the wiring?
 Anyone have thoughts or ideas?  This has been converted from 6v to 12v, and
 yes as a novice mechanic, I do have wires left over, no clue where they
 go...
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Thank You in advance
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Make it a Great Day!!
