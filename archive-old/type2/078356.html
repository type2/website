Subject: Re: [T2] torque wrench

Do it yourself.  Clamp the square drive in a vise, hang a known weight at
the handle end.  Multiply the weight by the distance from the drive to the
handle and compare the value to the reading on the wrench.  +/- 5% is
normal for new wrenches.

&gt; I think it's probably a good thing to get my torque wrench recalibrated
&gt; before putting my engine back together.  It's a craftsman wrench and
&gt; it's at least 5 years old so it's probably a little bit out of
&gt; adjustment.

&gt; Where do I go to get this done?  Does Sears do this or are there special
&gt; shops that'll do it?
