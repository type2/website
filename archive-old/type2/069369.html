Subject: 009/carb question

OK, so I've watched numerous dumpings on the ol' 9, which never gives ME any
trouble except this:
I have a 1600 singleport w/ doghouse, 009, monza exhaust and a Brosol Solex
H30/31PICT1 carb. Timing is set at 10.5 on the pulley. I seem to run cool,
no pinging except REALLY steep hills, idles at 950, decent power, small
 stumble at second, 18 mpg. Which is low. And I suspect the mpg is low because
no matter WHAT I do, the thing runs pretty rich - to the point that gas fumes
outta the exhaust will set yer eyes ta burning. Which makes tinkering a joy.
I have also had a german solex (34 pict 2 if i remember) and a JAPANESE
solex(?!)(dumped it fast - LEAKED), so I don't think it's a carb-specific
prob, but maybe a synergy thing? Is there a carb/distributor combo that
would be better for my 71 Salina?
Or is it something else entirely?
