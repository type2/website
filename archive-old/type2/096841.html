Subject: 1st time white stag tent install

i'm wondering about the boot of the white stag tent as it hitches to the
chassis. using the tent page link i found some instructions for set up.
http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/images/wstag.gif
i don't understand the last instruction about the nylon chords since i
don't see any eyelets for them. anybody have different experience with this?

along those lines, there are two snaps in the lower corners of that boot.
is there someone that can p-mail a photo where the male part of the snaps
go. i'll find some and screw them in.  last, instructions mention a strip
of magnet for along the top for the gutter. can the dimensions of that
magnet be described. i think that's all i'm missing. with a little help
this could be bug/rain proof. thanks,    - steve
