Hi Chris,

1. Adam survived his &amp;quot;Open Door policy&amp;quot;, by virtue of an excellent  
sleeping bag.
2. I had heard that same story, but it was told to me as Kubelwagons  
(or was it Tiger Tanks???) in Russia during WW2.

Happy trails,

&amp;gt; 1) Did you have to defrost those dudes with the &amp;quot;malfunction door&amp;quot;  
&amp;gt; van in the morning ?
&amp;gt; 2) I've been told that some Canadian folks were making a (small  
&amp;gt; controlled) fire wood under  their engine to warm it up during  
&amp;gt; extreme cold, Is is true ????

&amp;gt; Your pictures really remind me the call of nature to go skiing in  
&amp;gt; Tahoe (CA) with my Westy , no hookup to run any  heater thought ,  
&amp;gt; candles and extra layers of anything worm will make it.
