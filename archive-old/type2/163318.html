Subject: Re: [T2] More 30 PICT 2 questions...

For the &quot;plug&quot; that Muir refers to - for 30PICT-1 (Round Bowl) and 30PICT-2
(Square Bowl) Carburetors, VW did sell a &quot;manual&quot; Pilot Jet to use in place
of the Idle Cut-Off Valve.

VW # 113 129 415 D, size is G55, although other sizes (from G45 thru G65)
were available too.

Many VW shops in biz for the past decade or so should have an assortment
laying around.  I still have a small stash of some myself, mostly new, a few
used ones too.

&gt;
&gt; Now for my second question.  The 30 PICT 2 from my '69 Westy has never had
&gt; an idle cut off valve
&gt; on it (or at least I've never seen it).  It just has this fitting in the
&gt; port:
&gt; http://images.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/pix/287164.jpg
&gt; Which looks like someone just cut off the threaded end of the valve.  But
&gt; I've also read (and seen
&gt; in the Bentley) that on this carb, the cut off valve was combined with a
&gt; pilot jet.
&gt; Do I need to get a cut off valve to fit into this port to plug the
&gt; hole?  Or can I just make up
&gt; some kind of plug to fill it in?  Muir makes some mention of VW selling a
&gt; plug to replace cut off
&gt; valve, but I've never seen this referenced anywhere else.
