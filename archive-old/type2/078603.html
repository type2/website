&lt;&lt; the torque from the T1 is not enough to destroy the tranny mounts which is 
the reason the T4 has a rear hanger. &gt; 
 
 Do you knowledgeable volks agree or disagree with this assertion? &gt;&gt;

I don't know how knowledgeable I consider myself to be, but I sure wouldn't 
do it unless I could determine that this is how VW mounted the 1600 in late 
bay european buses. 

Based on the specs of the two engines is there really enough difference in 
torque and weight between the 1600 and 1700 to render the hanger unecessary?

Find out how VW mounted the 1600 in late bay buses and carefully compare the 
rear trans mount &quot;fork&quot;, bracket and bolts of a type 1 to the bracket and 
bolts of the late bus before you make a final decision.

Based on my engine installation experiences with a 74 and 79 bus I'd say the 
rear &quot;hanger&quot; does more than just dampen torque.
