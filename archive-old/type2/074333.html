&gt; &gt;&gt; (It's a 76 Bus, 2 liter fuel injection, with the dreaded two barrel
&gt; carb.)
&gt; &gt;&gt; My electric fuel pump rattles like a can of spray paint, though I have
&gt; never
&gt; &gt;&gt; had fuel delivery problems, nor does it leak.  It is sort of loud, and
&gt; the

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I guess what I should have said was it was originally a 2 liter  fuel
&gt; injected motor, but then some dumba$$ went and changed it to the 2 barrel
&gt; progressive, a generic one at that(no names or good part numbers, anyway).
&gt; 
&gt; The present fuel pump  is mounted just below the gas tank, is square, and
&gt; has no numbers on it, so I have no clue what the pressure is.  The carb
&gt; doesn't flood or anything, and Bentley says it should be 35psi.  That's a
&gt; bit much for a carb I would think.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess I'll just leave it for now, since it still runs.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks you guys.
