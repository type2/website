&gt; I can't imagine my 78 being any different....
&gt; 
&gt; I bought 2 4x8 3/4&quot; at Lowe's and slid them right in thru the back 
&gt; hatch...
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't take out the center seats and just folded the back one down.
&gt; 
&gt; On mine, there is more than 48&quot; between the back hatch sides...I didn't 
&gt; even scratch anything.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, dave
