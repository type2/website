I think that's the key. A factory engine has no trouble trouble running at
speed but the crapola rebuilds w/ half-assed repair work and missing parts
can't perform long term under the same conditions.

&gt; It may be true that VW designed their vehicles to
&gt; perform at full throttle all the time, but it
&gt; hasn't been my experience that they ACTUALLY meet
&gt; that performance criterion.

The original beetle was designed, or so I've read, to run all day long at
100km/h on the autobahn of the 30s. Headline grabbing: yes. Practical? Maybe
not. History has shown that the engine required decades worth of
improvements to correct the original flaws.

&gt; I think most of the
&gt; consumer magazines agree that aircooled VW were
&gt; far short of reliable because of those
&gt; overheating/valve issues.

Even the high priced high tech Porsche engines suffer similar head failures.

&gt; I know for a fact that VW heads run hotter under
&gt; full throttle.  Oil temps rise too.  Oil pressure
&gt; lowers, especially if you are running thin 5W30
&gt; or 10W30.  T4 engines run even hotter than T1
&gt; engines.  I think everyone who has a set of
&gt; guages can verify this.

It's a design that history has passed on, that's all.

I like what Bentley has to say on the matter...

&quot;Because of the extreme conditions under which exhaust valves operate, many
experienced mechanics routinely replace any exhaust valves that have been in
service for 25k miles&quot;.

Amusing, eh?
