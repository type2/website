&gt; &gt;The 72-74 type 4 motors (and maybe slightly later) had really nice METAL
&gt; &gt;timing scales with white backgrounds and numbers painted on, so if you
&gt; &gt;see a 72-74 bus being parted out that's a nice part to rescue!
&gt; 
&gt; But if you hit them with carb spray....the numbers go by-by and you are left
&gt; with a white strip. The plastic ones have raised numbers that don't wipe off
&gt; :)

That's your penalty for being anal-retentive. No one has ever accused me
of having an engine that was too clean!!
