&gt; They are car tire's.
&gt; But they are rated at 1648 lbs._at_ 36 psi.
&gt;
&gt; And doing the calculations --subtracting for the DOT requirements--etc.
&gt; they still fall within the safety limitations that is required.
&gt;
&gt; I think each wheel is supposed to have something like 1400 lbs rating
&gt; minimum per tire--these fall in at 1428 lbs per wheel.

The manual for my '71 specifies 1520 pounds as the minimum load rating
for the proper reinforced tires.

Passenger tires must be derated by 9% to determine light truck load
capacity.  Doing the math  backwards, this means that a passenger tire
has to be rated at 1670 pounds to meet the intent of the 1520 pound
reinforced tire specification.

I used to use passenger tires too, until two of them decided to have belt
separations in the 100 mile stretch between Olancha and Bishop,
California.

Since then it has been 8-ply 185R14s!
