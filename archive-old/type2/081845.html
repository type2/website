Subject: Bus Body

Hi all,

My Bus has a reasonable sized dent in the panel right behind the drivers
door, which I thought would be easy to push out.  It ain't.  When  I do get
it pushed out and finished off, I was thinking of beefing up the brace that
runs inside the center of that panel.

My concern is of defeating the structural rigidity.  Is the Bus body
designed to crumple in a certain way in an accident?  Will added strength
cause an abnormal twisting, which could put occupants in added harm?

Now I of course don't expect to have to test out the matter, in fact the way
my Bus looks, people give me plenty of room, but I'm trying to look at the
bigger picture here.  The Bus is pretty well built in itself, but while it's
apart, I thought, what the heck.

Anybody else ever try something like this?

Thanks much.
