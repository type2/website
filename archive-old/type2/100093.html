Subject: Re: [T2] rollin' rollin' rollin' got that bus a rollin'

Great job Chris, your dad is right, as long as you have things apart, might
as well fix it right.  Like the old boy says, you can either fix it now, or
fix it later, but next time it might be beside the road in not so nice
conditions.

Really glad to hear you had a big hand in replaceing your rear wheel
bearings, there are many people who are afraid of that job.

&gt; well, my bus is finally rolling again... and i dont hear the droning
&gt; noise!!! WOO HOO! of coarse that could be just because the CV joints are
&gt; fully greased now, muffling the noise. the bearings in one joint were
&gt; very nasty looking, so i will have to replace that soon :(  so... after
&gt; 10 days without a wheel and replacing just about EVERYTHING on it, i
&gt; finally have my bus back!! YAY!!!
