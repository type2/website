Subject: [T2] friday posting

I came across a military surplus aircooled engine. they go for $299. I'm
sure it is not vw compatible but for those looking for gas powered
welders, compressors and such i though this might be interesting to the
list ... and its friday so i figured what the hell.
this is a military standard engine and parts are readily available.

the same store has cheap metric wrenches and other fun stuff useful for
the bus driver
