Subject: Thanks: Rear hatch -- interior latch?

Thanks to all who answered. What a resource this type2 list is!

The comments about fashioning an inside latch reminded me of an E.B. 
White essay published years ago. It was about the model T F*rd, but it 
applies to the transporter about equally, so in the extract below I have 
substituted the latter for the former:

	&quot;There was this about the Type 2: the purchaser never regarded 	
	his purchase as a complete, finished product. When you bought
	a Type 2, you figured you had a start--a vibrant, spirited
	framework to which could be screwed an almost limitless
	assortment of decorative and functional hardware. Driving 
	away from the agency, hugging the new wheel between your knees,
	you were already full of creative worry. A Type 2 was born
	naked as a baby, and a flourishing industry grew up out of
	correcting its rare deficiencies and combatting its fascinating
	diseases.&quot;
