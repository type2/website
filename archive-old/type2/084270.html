Subject: Re: [T2] Too tall for your Westy??

Does it fit for storage in the gap behind the folded top?

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; After about a year worth of camping in our new westy, one thing that didn't
&gt; exist in the z-bed that does in the westy is the lack of room for my feet to
&gt; really stretch out. Granted, I am 6 foot 2, but I would be willing to guess
&gt; I am not the only tall guy with a westy out there that would love an extra 5
&gt; inches of space either on the bottom bed or the top.
&gt; 
&gt; When sleeping up top im always afraid I will kick my feet through the
&gt; canvas, or I end up pushing my pillow over the edge. If it were just me
&gt; sleeping in there it would be fine, but with my more attractive half next to
&gt; me I don't have the room I need.
&gt; 
&gt; Solution :
&gt; 
&gt; Supplies are simple. I went to home depot and grabbed some scrap wood over
&gt; by where they do cuts and had em make me a piece 45 x 12 inches.
&gt; Cost : 21 cents
&gt; Next, I went to JoAnn fabric and got some foam, about an inch and a half
&gt; thick at 45 X 24 (they wouldn't cut it down the middle for me)
&gt; 
&gt; hint : a automatic knife cuts perfectly through that foam. sadly, I don't
&gt; have one at home and this is why my foam isn't quite perfect.
&gt; 
&gt; Fabric - you can cover it in whatever you want really. I found a yellow
&gt; westy at the yard and pulled some of the original fabric off of it to use
&gt; for my extension.
&gt; 
&gt; So I cut the foam to fit the wood, stapled it on the back and went to check
&gt; out how it was going to work.
&gt; 
&gt; See all the pics here :

&gt; 
&gt; I can't wait for the next camping trip when I can really stretch out my legs
&gt; and not worry about kicking the hatch door open or punching a hole through
&gt; my canvas top.
