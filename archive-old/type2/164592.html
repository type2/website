Subject: Re: [T2] Roger Daltry of the Who loves Buses!

I went to see The Who in Reno on their latest tour and they didn't play the 
bus song, Going Mobile!  I was so bummed because it's my fav. song to crank 
when I first leave home on a Westy trip!

However, Daltrey did make mention at the concert that in the 60s he once 
took his family all over the Sierras in a little camper (but I'm not sure if 
he referenced the Bus, but that's probably what it was).  Said it was one of 
the most precious trips of his life.

&gt; Great article:
&gt;
&gt; Did you know the song &quot;Going Mobile&quot; was about a VW Bus?
