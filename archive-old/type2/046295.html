Tom and Dana Cates sends:

&gt; A new paint will soon be available that will make insulation as we know it
&gt; obsolete. R-Paint, manufactured by Sherwin-O'Brien Paint Company, promises
&gt; an R-value of 26 with one coat of paint. R-Paint is expensive at just over
&gt; $50 a gallon, but there's no question it's worth every penny. The building
&gt; world is scrambling to prepare for the consequences.

Sounded like BS to me...and when you go to the site it turns out to be just
that. There is a real paint, which doesn't have to be pink, with insulating
properties, but it's only R-1.5, which is equivalent to the blue styrofoam
panels you can get at any decent home center.
