&gt; Volks,

&gt; I just started noticing when I turn the steering wheel left to right (at
&gt; a stop light, or in my garage) I hear a &quot;clunk&quot; coming from under my
&gt; feet.  It's worse when turning the wheel left, but you can hear it in
&gt; either direction (all of this is while the bus is not moving).

Check the rod ends on the drag link.  That is a more likely source of the
clunk than the steering box.  Also check the bolts that hold the steering
box in place.  It is helpful to have someone sit in the driver's seat to
recreate the &quot;clunk&quot; while you look for the culprit.
