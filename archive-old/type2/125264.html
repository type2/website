Subject: Re: [T2] Type 1 engine Alternator Wiring instead of Gen

Karl,
Say it isn't so... Is there no way around this??  I currently have no
vehicles running (have had 3 different engines die in the last 3 weeks) and
am stuck at the house, so a drive to the salvage yards is not an easy task.

Several people mentioned wiring up with a regulator from a 72 bus so I
bought one yesterday as someone gave me a ride home from work.  I just can't
figure which wires go where and how to incorporate the regulator in to the
mix.

:(
Snoopy



&gt; This is true IF you use a Bosch alternator with the internal regulator.
&gt;
&gt; Snoopy, unfortunately, is not.......
&gt;
&gt; He has a bug Motorola alternator that needs the external regulator.
&gt; He needs to go to a wrecking yard and find a bug that used the Motorola
alt and hopefully
&gt; still has the Motorola regulator under the rear seat on the left side AND
still has the harness between the
&gt; regulator and alternator..... good luck!!
