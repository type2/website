Subject: Re: [T2] solenoid trouble

FYI for all folks having starter switch problems....

It has been reported that the ignition switches that are generally 
currently available are just crap....If you get a new one, look over the 
crimps and other parts before installing it.

Kinda like I learned from an ex girlfriend who was also a very good 
seamstress...I learned from her to look over the clothes that I was 
purchasing and look carefully at the seams and such.

I can't tell you how many times I have looked thru several of the same 
item I was planning to buy before I found one that wouldn't come apart the 
first few times I washed it.

Caveat Emptor------Let the buyer beware.


What I *really* want someone to find is and entire VW warehouse left over 
from the 70's chock full of &quot;real&quot; original vw parts(only the good ones!).

Tom, one size larger than original would probably be more than fine...I 
might suggest that you buy a 25' roll and then put a connector on it and 
just unroll it on the ground and up to your ignition switch *before* you 
spend the time to actually route it under the bus...see what happens after 
that and make a decision.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I think I need to replace the wire running from the ignition switch to my

&gt; My newish ignition switch does make the solenoid click, but it rarely turns 
&gt; over. This with a strong battery, clean connections and a new starter motor. 
&gt; My auxiliary start button at the back(which connects to the same crimp on 
&gt; terminal the other wire does) fires it up like lightning every time. It 


snipped for the list police
