I absolutely concur.  The compression test will tell all.  I wouldn't worry
about re-using the old pistons and cylinders unless they were really worn
(and I've never seen a really worn set).  I would probably have re-used the
rings too.  I know they seem like a wear item, but if you were not burning
oil and your compression was strong and even then they were probably okay.
If you replaced the rings without honing the cylinders, that could easily
be your problem.  The rings and cylinders sort of wear into each other to
make a good seal.  New rings with &quot;old&quot; cylinders will mess that
relationship up.
