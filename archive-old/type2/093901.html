&lt;&lt; Find out how much you speedo is out.  Have a friend in
a new vehicle drive beside you at 30, 50, etc etc.
 &gt;&gt;

If your friend's speedo is accurate, pace him/her at 20, 30, 40,
etc. and just use press-on numbers from the stationary store
on the face of your speedo for your &quot;real&quot; speed.
