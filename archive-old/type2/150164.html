Subject: Re: [T2] Mr Heater Buddy

Hi Mark,

We camp with 4 or 5 people sleeping in the bus.... At EB2005 at night  
the windows steamed up even with an electric heater in the bus.

  IIRC it's typical for most people to exhale about a pint of water  
overnight. More if they're active. ;-P

&gt; We just cracked a window 1/2&quot; and put the buddy on the floor  
&gt; between the
&gt; seats, heat rises, so my wife and I and baby Sofia stayed nice and  
&gt; warm.
&gt; We did have problems with the water accumulation on the windows,  
&gt; but that
&gt; was really a minor nuisance really.


Happy trails,
