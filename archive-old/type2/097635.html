Subject: VW Bus Calendar(s)

The response to the VW calendar that I did for the www.Buskatiers_dot_com has been
great  .http://204.26.80.78:8084/buskatier2003.pdf    I would like to offer my
services to the Vintage Bus group and the Type 2 group.  If you have some very
photogeninic VW busses I would love to see them  captoaster_at_cox_dot_net  and see
if I can work them into a calendar.  The calendar would be free for the
download but I would like you to think about donating to the list through
here.
 Vintage Bus and Type 2 donations here......
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/donate.html   Hope the Admin's don't mind!!   I am
hoping they will host it for me!!??
Thanks and Happy Holidays
Rob Laffoon
