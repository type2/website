Subject: Steering Box

    New they run about $700. No, seriously. Rebuilts range from $250 to
$300. One guy told me that there's a crucial gear in there that no one
makes any more that may or may not be replaced in the rebuild; if the
problem in the box is that little &quot;lost&quot; spot when moving (or a nasty
clunk turning the wheel when stationary) you may still have a problem.
The VeeDub yard gets about $75 for used.
    I found one on a parts car for $50. Bloodied some knuckles swapping
it (that Pittman arm is a whole subject in itself) and the &quot;new&quot; box was
only marginally better than the old one. What are ya gonna do.
