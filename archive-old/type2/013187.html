	Years ago I used Dupont Chroma-one paint to paint (of all things) an
electric guitar. Now in the next few weeks I plan on giving the still
unnamed 79 bus a good coat. Can anyone recommend/not this dupont product
or suggest any others that come to the market since I did this? I was
very happy with the results and the urithane finish is very tough. Seems
there might be some better paint developed over the past 5 or so years.
