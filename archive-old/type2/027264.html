Have him comitted :).

Is it out of gear with clutch in? If so, you might be able to start it..then 
ease clutch out and pop the lever out of its &quot;stuck&quot; position. Or if he used 
too much muscle on it..might have just mechanically jammed it...in which 
case you may be able to (check Bentley)uncover the floorboard shift linkage, 
loosen the bolts, then use a screwdriver to lever it into neutral.Then 
readjust it to spec. Just a thought..good luck in getting back on the road..
