This reminds me of a white late 80's model DC that was at the VW Classic in
Irvine, CA.  This guy had an outrageous V8 in it.  For a minute I thaught I
was at the Winter Nationals.  I'm talking like 450 HP of rumbling chest
pounding thunderous, aluminum heads, huge carb, fat header, American
testosterone type stuff.  NUTS!!!
