Subject: RE: [T2] Please advise on a weird hot starting problem

Marc,
I had the same problem... You don't say where your from but here's what my
problem was.  I live in Northern NJ.  It gets somewhat cold here.  Anyway,
would start right up after sitting for a week or more.  Drive to the store,
engine is mighty warm.  Go to start it again and nothing.  The problem with
mine was the choke got cold and closed...while the engine was still warm.
The electric chokes cool down really quickly.  Adjust the choke about 1/4&quot;
clockewise to open the butterfly a bit.  It worked for me.
