&gt;From: &quot;Chris M.&quot; You know the PPM measurement seems a bit misleading... 
&gt;Okay my VW is allowed xxx PPM, and the new 4WD SUV whatever is allowed 1/2 
&gt;that. However, how many million parts does that SUV put out in 10K miles 
&gt;and how much does the VW?


Exactly! But I don't know how to check on mileage like that most analizers I 
have seen only have about a '50 Hose for the sniffer  =D
