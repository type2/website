&gt;Yuk! Gail, With all due respect, I wouldn't buy that one at any price.

&gt;1- 1972 is the first year of pancake engine with dual carbs and smog
&gt;equipment.

Just to clarify, 72 does not have much smog equipment.  No EGR, no air 
injection (both started in '73 in the US).  That makes it my favorite year 
engine in the 72-74 range.

&gt;There are throttle linkage parts that are no longer available
&gt;from any source.  Smogging it, esp. in CA, could be tough.

I won't argue that except to say that aftermarket carbs would probably pass 
California smog if the inspection station was not familiar with VW busses 
and the manifolds were drilled for manifold vacuum for the vacuum retard.

If you're looking for a very low cost beater bus, this could be it.  In 
this case I would offer somewhere in the $100-$500 range depending on how 
well it runs.  If you're looking for one to sink some money into, forget 
about this one just because of the RUST.
