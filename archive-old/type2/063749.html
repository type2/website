I don't know if Permatex anti-seize compound is good at such
high temperatures, but I imagine it would work.  (What good
would anti-seize compund be if it didn't prevent seizing at high
temps?)

I always use &quot;copper&quot; self-locking nuts, but never bothered with
the anti-seize stuff.  I don't think the nuts really are copper,
which would be too soft, but they're copper colored and seem to
stay on when they're supposed to, and come off when you're ready
to take them off.  I never re-use old nuts since the
self-locking feature only works once.  (BTW nylon-insert type
self-locking nuts don't work on the exhaust system--the nylon
part melts out.)

Independent VW shops up and down the west coast seem to carry
both Permatex anti-seize and the &quot;copper&quot; nuts.  (Donnsco VW
Parts in San Carlos, CA, for example.)  If you can't find them
in Australia, I can probably pick some up for you and put them
in the mail once I get back from Fairbanks (it'll be a couple of
weeks, though).

If you install new studs and &quot;copper&quot; nuts, I bet you won't have
this problem next time you need to remove the exhaust system.

Happy Drilling,
Dennis
