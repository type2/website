Subject: GER: Late Bay RHD Camper Panel Van, anyone?

Hi Volks!

A pal of mine found an RHD bus for sale here in Germany.
I haven't seen it myself, but from his description it's
a Panel Van, walkthrough, with one aftermarket window
opposite the single left sliding door and a supposedly
nice homemade interior finished in dark wood.  Late Bay,
exact vintage unknown (to us), 2 litre engine.  Normal 
rust.  Has sat for years, but was driven there.  DM 600,
that's around EUR 300 for you Euro listees (I don't think
anyone would want to export it to the US, huh? ;-)

Now you know as much as I do.  Contact me if you want
me to check it out.

Airhowlingly yours, 
    Erik.
