Subject: Rebuilt/Remanuf. VW Diesel 

My sister in Illinois said she blew a lower radiator hose and immediatly fried
the engine in her diesel rabbit.

Other than the following 3 sources any of you have any recommendations or any
comments on the three that I list (dealer obviously is expensive, and money is
tight for her)

o  VW dealer - Canadian rebuilt engines
o  GEX
o  Parts Place Inc (formerly Recycled Bugs)

Any inputs would be appreciated, Thanks
Harvey
