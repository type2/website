Subject: Re: [T2] Re: front brake trouble

I just finished my front brake job ('71 - Fr. disk brakes) Saturday. My
symptoms were similar, but did not lock the wheel up, but at high speeds, in
hard braking the bus would dive to the right, then due to the warped rotors,
would kinda pull to the left, and back to the right.
 When it pulls to one side when braking, I believe whichever side it pulls
to, is the caliper that is not braking enough (I often get this backwards,
so please those of you who know, correct me).
 Either way, if one of the calipers has blown a seal, or has pitting (you
cannot see this until you pull the caliper apart) therefore breaking the
seal which makes the piston close the shoes...ack I think I am getting to
technical this early in the morning...Basically if one caliper is bad,
replace both. You can get rebuilt calipers at your local vw store, or
online. I'm pretty sure bus depot has them.
 There are also rebuild kits, but if you decide to do this, you need to make
sure the inside of the caliper where the piston rides is NOT pitted, you
will just end up in the same situation.
BTW you can NOT hone the piston area in a caliper.
 If you get new calipers, get new shoes (I have been told PBR's are organic,
don't dust, and last longer than regular shoes) and if your rotors have not
been turned before get them turned! Usually rotors can only be turned twice,
after that they get to thin and are more prone to warping.
 Here is an approximate on prices for a full front brake tune-up:
Turning rotors: $15/each (can be done at your local napa or tire store)
New rotors: $30/each
Rebuilt calipers (x2): $40-50/each
Rubber brake hoses(x2): $5-10/each
New shoes(set=4): $10-20/set
 Also make sure to get a bottle of (IIRC - If I Remember Correctly) Dot 3
brake fluid, and get a friend to help you bleed the brakes, if you have the
idiots guide, there is a good explanation of how to do this. This is
definitely worth the effort and the money, it is waay to scary to have bad
brakes in emergency situations.
 Good luck!!!
