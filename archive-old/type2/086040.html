Subject: Points keep frying...

Hey all...

I'm usually pretty good at figuring things out myself, but I'm stumped on 
this one. My points keep fouling after 50 - 100 miles.

Here's what I have...

(71?) Mexican 1600 w/Pict 30/31 Carb (new carb)
009 Distributor

What I've done...

1. New plugs, points, condensor, coil, wires, cap, rotor about 5 months ago 
with less than 2000 miles since.

2. Broke down last month, replaced points (fried) and plugs (black) -- 
everything else looked good. Plugs were black due to old carb problems -- 
didn't replace plugs w/new carb install.

3. Broke down last week. Thought it was a fuel issue, but turned out to be 
points -- replaced. Checked plugs -- beautiful condition.

4. Broke down yesterday. Points had a little of that solder-looking stuff, 
filed it off (didn't have a new set on-hand), re-installed and she ran fine.

Other info...

1. The coil is not the Bosch Blue -- it's a black one from the local FLAPS.

2. Plugs are Bosch (regular, not &quot;super&quot;).

3. Rotor, cap and wires are from FLAPS.

4. Points are Bosch

5. When she runs, she runs great -- smooth idle and acceleration, no 
backfiring, no hesitation. When this happens, she basically just cuts out 
without warning -- no sputtering, etc.


What am I missing here? I know that points are a regular &quot;wear&quot; item, but 
they've always lasted at least 5000 miles for me. Any ideas or suggestions 
appreciated...
