Subject: Hoover Oil temp sender Install?

Volks,
Has anyone actually used the oil temp sender install as recommended by
Brother Hoover in an AS41 case? (In the oil return galley).  Ron Van
Ness shows the location and gives a brief discussion in his engine
rebuild notes (BTW thanks Ron!) Any problems?  Did the J.C. Whipme
adapters fit well?

Gotta have one on my new engine.
TIA
Shawn Clark

P.S. Rebuild update
Ordered a new AS41 case....for $275 (seems the Brazilian Economic ruin
has one advantage)
Waiting on balancing and parts order from Bus Depot (those guys are
awesome!)
more later
