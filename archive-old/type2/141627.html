Subject: Re: [T2] Westy tent?

I have a tent, I like it. But, I will only set it up if I know I will NOT be 
moving for at least 3 full days or so.

They are not really a drive-away tent.

Yes, it is a pain, but I love having a floor and I love the smell of it...

  Does anybody here really like their tents? Responses on The Samba
  appear to be about 50/50.
