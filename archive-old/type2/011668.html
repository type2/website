what year bus and how fast do you want to go?

The 4.57 is the highest or lowest depending on your POV ratio
for the '68-'92 type2 vehicles.  It is the common ratio in 091 boxes
built '76 to '83, and the '76-'79 version will fit in about any '68-'79
without too many issues.  It gives fair cruising rpms and the ability
to spin OK revs with a stock 2.0 to about 75 mph or so.  IF YOU
HAVE THE POWER.  As in at least a stock 2.0, or for instance
a reasonably built 1776 Type 1 or better.

I have a www site up on T2 with a ratio versus rpm versus speed
thingy.

If you got excel it should open a spreadsheet automatically and allow
you to tinker.
