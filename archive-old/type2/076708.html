Subject: re:Snake oil cooling info???

Bill asked:
&gt;2. On an older topic of cooling - I recently read 
again (somewhere I =
can't remember) that the cast aluminum valve covers 
will help keep the =
engine cooler than original covers.  I also remember 
in a forum that =
someone said the original valve covers worked just as 
well and that the =
cork gaskets served to insulate the cover from much of

the engine heat.
&gt;Any thoughts on this?
______________

What I remember reading/hearing about the subject of
shiney aluminum valve covers is that they lead to
higher oil temperatures as the do not cool the oil
that splatters into them like the black stock ones do.
 There is often a problem getting them to fit tightly,
too, especially if they are held on by studs and nus
rather than wire bails.  
Sounds like something I may have read in the Idiot
Book years ago.
