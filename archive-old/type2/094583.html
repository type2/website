Hello all.

I know this has nothing to do with the normal list stuff...But I am besid=
e myself. I am angry. And this has nothing to do with my bus, except if T=
unes had been parked where she normally is, this could be about her. Why?=
 Because tonight, as I sat in the pool at my condo, right before my very =
eyes, three punk kids jumped down off the second floor landing right on t=
he hood and roof of my 1992 Ford 'Bug' Festiva (earlier in the day we had=
 noticed a new dent along the back and someone had broke the back lock on=
 the hatchback). These kids had jumped the fence earlier and we observed =
them go up stairs to somewhere on the second floor...
Anyway, I chased after them, but they got away...We called the police, an=
d they can't do much; they gave me a case number for my insurance.

They smashed the hood real good. The roof is beyond repair. The sunroof a=
ctually stayed firm. However, the rain gutters that run the length of the=
 roof are cracked, and water now flows into the car. It is totaled. Oh, t=
he car will run, but not over 55 MPH now (the aerodynamics will make the =
car shimmy and shake so bad it won't be safe)...

ARGGH! I want to shout, scream , I dunno. Just furious about this, but th=
ere is nothing I can do about it...

It's just punk kids with no supervision, no parents that give a rats butt=
. I hope I never see these kids again. Oh I know, I know, if I did anythi=
ng, I'd be blamed. So that's why I hope I never see these kids again.

So Charlie Brown, The Ford Bug Festiva (so named since it lasted like a V=
W Bug) , the car that just crossed over 151,000 miles, and I have had for=
 FIVE years, is beyond repair. And not by another car, in some dumb accid=
ent.

Just humans being jerks.
