&gt;I had a European-spec '71 that included a type of hook under the pop top

===============================&gt;
My 69 camper does not have one of these front hooks, and I always cringe
when a semi goes by.
My 70 camper does have one of these hooks, and I feel lot more secure (no
pun intended) knowing that the front of the fiberglass top is snugged down
a bit more securely.

The difference as to whether or not the front hook is on the camper might
be a function of the 69 being a &quot;camper conversion&quot; and the 70 being a
true Westfalia conversion !?

Correct, Wrong, Comments?? ......................

Having just gotten the 70 Westfalia, I notice other differences between it
and the 69 camper, that leads me to this rather lightly researched
conclusion.

&gt;The hook/eye arrangement used hardware very similar to what fastens the 
&gt;top back of the passenger seat in bay window buses. The trick was that 
&gt;as you lifted the top up and back, the angle of lift caused this hook to 
&gt;disengage with the eye (the eye was on the bus side; the hook on the 
&gt;top). Placement would obviously be of the utmost importance an would 
&gt;have to be determined with the top down, but matched so the top would 
&gt;lift as well. I do not remember exactly how the hook was attached to the 
&gt;top, but I suspect it was connected to a wooden brace as well as to the 
&gt;fiberglass top.
&gt;
&gt;Chris Venema (cvenema_at_uafsysb.uark_dot_edu) owned this bus after me if you 
&gt;want to see if he knows more about this hook.
&gt;
&gt;Have fun! Joe
