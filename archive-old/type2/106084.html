&gt; I have to disagree here...  The plastic bits inside of these decay over
time and use, so in my opinion you're better off buying one new and never
having to mess with it for the rest of your life.  ;-)  I don't like pulling
the dash apart.

I agree.  I was going to recast the plastic parts (already did the little
hook things that hold the wavy spring in place), and cast a new arm, but
decided that a new switch wouldn't hurt.  The brass thing that completes the
horn circuit by rubbing against the bottom of the steering wheel actually
has a large hole completely through it anyway (about half the width of the
thing is missing).

On a bright note, I installed a prototype of the ergonomic shifter knob last
night, and it's very nice.  I've got another of the prototype sitting next
to me at the moment, and that one will become the master for the production
version.  It's great to be able to spread that &quot;reverse gear shove&quot; across
the entire palm of my hand. :O)

Granted, I was shifting without any knob at all before that...
