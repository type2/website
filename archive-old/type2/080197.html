Hey Scott,

From what you, and everybody else has said it sounds like you may have an 
exhaust leak being sucked into your bus, just to be safe you should look 
into a carbon monoxide detector.  You wouldn't want you to pass out from the 
fumes and wreck the bus :)

I know that this is normal, but it smells awful.  My concern is that the 
burning paint smell is coming through the heater system anytime I turn the 
heater on.  Is this normal?
