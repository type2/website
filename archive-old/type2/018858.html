&gt; So, my question to the list: What should I do here? Should I go to a brake
&gt; shop and see if they can bust the axle nut loose using pneumatic impact
&gt; wrenches? Or perhaps order one of those special tools from J.C. Whitney
&gt; that are supposed to be used with a hammer and a 1/2&quot; breaker bar? Or
&gt; should I go to Wally Mart and get a propane torch and cook the axle nut and
&gt; then try to wrest it off using the El Cheapo breaker bar? I'm open to
&gt; suggestions.

Robert:
Either the hammer-wrench thingy or as someone suggested the other day
(can't remember, but I liked it a lot): call the mobile truck tire
repair guy with the 175lb compressor and spline drive air wrench that's
probably good for 600 ft-lbs!
