Subject: Re: [T2] VPC Air Conditioner for Station Wagon

Sherwin,

Here are the pics.

http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/78busac/

If some don't make sense, let me know.  Obviously, I did not folow the 
standard hose layout exactly and probably need to get another shot of the 
relay set up.

BTW, the VPC power supply setup is **far** superior to the DPD one.

BEWARE!  The pics are large...folks with a 56k connection can expect to 
wait on them.


The last 3 pics shown as best I could where the compressor *is*&lt;grin&gt; and 
where it isn't.

Bring on the questions!

To the other folks wanting the compressor shots, you have to wait till 
after this weekend cause this is the bus &quot;daily driver&quot; week....all 
week...and the list of things that I forgot to do and put off doing is 
starting to fill my 3X5 card for the bus.

You can also check the pics and see how I installed the nice 
retractable seatbelts from my 81 vanagon parts bus.

Cheers, dave


Cheers, dave

&gt; But since I'm planning to use my Kombi as a daily driver after I've fully
&gt; restored it into stock, I really am considering the rotary compressor for
&gt; practical reasons. So please, keep your inputs coming. And maybe someone out
&gt; there who has had experience with air conditioning a bus with a type-1
&gt; engine, share their knowledge.
