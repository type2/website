&gt; &gt;Buy it now so you'll be ready... My Facet only lasted a few months. Grr...

&gt; I see them for sale in the aircraft catalogs labelled &quot;for experimental
use only&quot;! Of course that's in regard to TSO etc but would YOU fly a plan
with that pump installed?

I would, but remember that airplanes either have gravity feed or a
mechanical pump.  The electric pump is a backup and only runs for short
periods.  It is tested every flight with a fuel pressure guage.

Years ago I had a Facet pump, ran it for years, and it was still working
well when I sold the vehicle.  Considering the simple nature of these
pumps, I wonder what causes them to fail?  Is it something VW-related?
