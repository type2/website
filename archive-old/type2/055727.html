&gt;4) bad/missing enrichment/lean-out resistor unit (Jim Thompson)
&gt;
&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt;  I can’t figure out where the squarish resistor unit Jim was
&gt;talking about would go, exactly, but i don’t seem to have it, and I’m
&gt;not sure from which years the pairs I have are (any tips on this?) he
*********************************************
Just to set the record straight, I was in error on that post in regards to
year applicability of the Enrichment/Lean-Out Resistor Unit.  It only fits
on 1972 32PDSIT applications.  73-74 did not use this unit.  I believe I
made a follow-up post on that when questioned by a few list members and
they were right.  My apologies.  BTW, I have a couple of NOS Carb Tops with
these units still for sale for that hapless 72 owner who needs one. - See
the Oddball Page on my website.  I also have a NOS Right Side 32PDSIT
Carburetor for the Man Trans 74 - again see the Oddball Page.
*********************************************
&gt;The manifolds for one pair are longer than the others, apparently to
&gt;make room for the EGR piping mounts -- which reminds me, do I want to
&gt;keep this piping, minus the connections to the heads, as a balance tube?
*********************************************
You shouldn't have to IF you still have the factory balance tube that
mounts to the Firewall Tin.  This balance tube also has the connection port
for the Power Brake Servo Hose and Tube.  If you're missing that, I have
them good used for $10.00.  That way you can cap off the EGR ports and
remove the piping.
