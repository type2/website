Subject: CV / axle work San Fran/Bruno

Hello,

My 76 westy has developed a clicking/popping sound coming from the rear, I
think right, but hard to say from inside, and it comes and goes and changes
with the speed at which im travelling. It did stop for a while, and I was
unable to make it do it again, but started back up after letting it sit for
about a week and I need to get it taken care of...

Can anyone suggest any shops in the bay area to have this type of work done?
I used to do everything at Glen's aircooled but with high rent he finally
packed up and moved elsewhere.... I know of Fred's down in Redwood city, and
hes great and everything but its hard for me to get rides down there and
back all the time...

I know someone suggested a place in Daly City once before, but I do not
remember the name of the place...


Thanks for any suggestions you can pass along....
