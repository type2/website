Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor Grease

Hiya Jay,

IIRC the Bosch distributor grease is built on a wax/parafin base.  This is 
supposed to prevent it from running all over the place.  And you definitely 
wouldn't want grease to go flinging around inside your distributor.  On the other 
hand the fiber &quot;rider&quot; on your points needs some sort of lubrication if it is 
not to wear down or just outright break/crumble.
My guess is that you can probably get by with using a THIN coat of lithium or 
moly grease for a SHORT time.  At least until you locate some of the Bosch 
stuff.
