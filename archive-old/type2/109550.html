Subject: Re: [T2] UPDATE::Re: [T2] Valve not wanting to adjust !!

New springs will have the same valve stem clearance to the rocker
as an old spring. The stem heights were the same before and after.
What was the valve adjustment clearance error ?
New springs can be installed without removing the cylinder head.

&gt; I have solved the problem valve:
&gt; the valve was weaker then the rest of head #1.
&gt; Ichecked the valves to make sure they were level, they
&gt; were, I then removed head and took it to my local vw
&gt; house (Car Craft), had them install 4 new springs, 
&gt; reinstalled head, checked for clearance......... BINGO
&gt; !!
