Subject: 1978 T2

Hello Friends,
I'm new to the vintage VW scene and need a little
assitance. I'm looking at and have put money down on a
1978 Type 2 with the 2.0 engine. The body is fairly
good with minimal rust and the driver side door
replaced. Chassis rust is non existent and over-all it
looks like a pretty clean vehicle. I did give it a
test drive which went well, tranny seemed fine and
although it drifted a little it drove fairly well. (I
don't have anything to base that on since it was the
first one I've driven.) The one thing that I neglected
to do that's worrying the heck out of me was a
compression test. There was also a small leak out of
the left side of the engine which I'm told is probably
the oil cooler. No leak while idling but after running
on the freeway for 1/2 hour it dripped for about 3
min. a puddle a little larger than a quarter, then
stopped. 
  Is there any way that I can figure out from driving
it how good or bad the compression is? It seemed to
have fairly decent power took a little while to get up
to sixty but like I said I don't have anything to base
that on. Should I be worried and do a compression
test? Any advice on the oil leak? 
Thanks, peace,
Giles
