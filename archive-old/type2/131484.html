Subject: Re: [T2] RE: '77 Manual tranny and engine into a '73 Bus

&gt;From: &quot;Snoopy&quot; You will not be able to shift.  You will have to adjust the 
&gt;shifter linkage
&gt;at the front of bus.  IT is under the cab section towards middle of bus in
&gt;center.  Untie the safety wire (hopefully it is still there)  undo the 
&gt;bolt.
&gt;adjust linkage, drill new hole and install screw.  See if it works.  Adjust
&gt;moe if neccesary until shifting is right.  Saftey wire it back on.
&gt;I had to drill about 4 holes to get it right.


Thanks for the tip Snoopy. Did you have to change the nose cone? If not is 
that why you had to adjust the linkage?
