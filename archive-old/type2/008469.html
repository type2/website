Can anybody provide with input on what are desirable gauges for my 81
Westy?
Sorry if this topic was in the archives, but I don't have web access

A PO put an oil temp gauge in : ), I was wondering if a cylinder head
temp gauge made sense too.  What are expected oil temp and cylinder head
temps?
In addition to the oil temp gauge and the possible cylinder head temp
gauge, I was planning to add a volt meter. Was also thinking of oil
press., but a couple of people had voiced opinion that the idiot lite is
fine for this application - comments?

P.S. if anybody knows where I could get a sensor for my Mallory oil temp
gauge, I'd appreciate it.

(names we were considering, but were seen on the list - Pokey, Gumby, and
putty-putty-putt-putt, but Putty seen on list - You guys have taken all
the good names! Wish I had thought of The Lorax, then again, I only would
have been disappointed again - IDEAS?
