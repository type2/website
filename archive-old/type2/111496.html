&gt;My 76 isn't idling like she should be.  She has a 2L FI (GD code) engine.
&gt;I've checked the dwell (48) and the timing is right on the money at 7.5 BTDC
&gt;and doesn't fluctuate at all.  I checked all of the valves and they are at
&gt;.006.  I also checked my compression and I have 1-123 2-122 3-121 4-123.
&gt;The spark plugs look fine.  With the dwell meter hooked up and the engine
&gt;warm the idle fluctuates from 780 to 950.  Turning the idle adjustment screw
&gt;will raise the numbers, but the fluctuation is the same.  I've looked
&gt;through my Bentley and there are multiple causes, but I thought that I would
&gt;ask the list to narrow it down before I begin testing everything on my
&gt;engine.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks so much,
