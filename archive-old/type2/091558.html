Subject: 009 Distributor Advance / Carb Jetting

I have two topics that the list might be
able to help with.

68 Westy w/ a 30 Pict 1 carb and 009 dizzy:

My 009 distributor is only advancing about 10 degrees
at 3000 rpm (I'm checking this with an inductive timing
light at idle and at 3000rpm).  I have to set the idle 
timing at 19 degrees to get 29 degrees of total advance.  
From reading the archives, I am under the impression that
I should be getting about 22 degrees of advance and 
should be setting the idle timing at about 8 degrees
to get 30 degrees of total advance.  Will this lack 
of advance have a negative affect on my engine 
performance or mileage-wise?  Should I consider 
replacing the 009?  I'm not really asking about 
replacing the 009 w/ a vac dizzy, more just about 
replacing it with a newer 009.  The engine seems to
run quite well once warmed up.

I live at 7400 feet and do most of my driving
in the 6000-9000 foot range.  Should I consider
changing the jets in my carb to alter the air/fuel
ratio?

Thanks for the advice,
Brad Baker
