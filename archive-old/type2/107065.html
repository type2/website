Subject: Re: [T2] bad tire news  

&gt; &gt; 14&quot; commercial rated tires have always been a minute fraction of the
&gt; &gt; commercial tire market. I can't name another vehicle that calls for 14&quot;
&gt; &gt; commercial load rated tires.
&gt;
&gt; Toyota pickup trucks and cab/chassis (used by U-Haul).  Apparently that is
&gt; why Bridgestone/Firestone continues to carry them.

I think there is a USPS vehicle that uses them.&gt;
