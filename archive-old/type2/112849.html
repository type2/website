Subject: Re: [T2] seattle /west sound area parts

I don't know the severity of your problem, but if you just need to start
the car, plug up the hole in the intake manifold and also plug the hole
in the &quot;S&quot; tube.  Then, if you're having trouble starting the engine,
hold the throttle open a little when you start the car to let it warm
up.  That should get you by...

Otherwise, check any FLAPS because they might happen to have a similar
elbow.

HTH,
Mike
