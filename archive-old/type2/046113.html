Content-Disposition: inline

Something is wrong with this thing!!! If it is supposed to hold 15 gallons, then why does my 1973 fill up with only 8.5 gallons?? After that, it overflows!!! The gauge shows full, when I fill it with 8.5 gallons, then it goes, after driving a while, down (Obviously, duh!!) In the process, it will leak fuel  from the right side, when I turn a sharp left,  and it will leak fuel after I fill the tank and turn a sharp right!! Is this bus doomed to be a likely candidate to be a rolling torch??

The fuel tank in my 1973 passenger bus holds 15 gallons. I know this because
I ran out of gas and then filled in all the way up. It is possible that a PO
replaced the fuel tank in my bus but I think it unlikely.

I'll let other more knowledgable answer the second question.
