Subject: Re: What Distributor Do I have

Janyce,

The Bentley manual lists various distributors by part number and shows the
advance/retard settings for each. This is on page 73 in the Engine chapter.

Also, check www.type2_dot_com; Library; distributor; Ignition Parts and
Specifications. This is the stuff that used to be on Jim Thompson's site
with all the specs on which distributors were used in which years and such
as that. There's quite a bit more on dizzy's and ignition timing that may
be useful with your current pursuits.

Thanks! Joe
