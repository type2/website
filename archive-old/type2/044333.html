Subject: [T2] Re: [VB] junk yard cutting tools?

I took a sledge as well as other hammers,  a cordless sawsall, a hacksaw
(with extra blades for both), cold chisels, a big bolt cutter and different
sixes of good metal shears. And what I forgot was GOOD gloves. I knew I
needed gloves the minute I started bleeding..
