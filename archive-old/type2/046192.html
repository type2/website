Subject: Re: [T2] 1970 owners manual

That would be great if you could post it on your site.  I've scanned and emailed
to those who requested it from me, but the file size is large (bitmap) as I don't
have the capability to convert it to .pdf.  So, emailing it is a major pain in
the b*tt.

&gt; I am leaving tomorrow for  a three week trip driving from Ca to Tennessee and
&gt; back. But when I return I can scan my 1970 manual, the westy supplement if
&gt; anyone wishes. The 1970-2 brochure is available somewhere on the web. I you
&gt; want, I can put that up on my site.
&gt; Let me know in three weeks.
