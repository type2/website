&lt;&lt;The change in the law will do _nothing_ to have your bus &quot;run better, get

time regardless of the law.&gt;&gt;

And doing these things as a result of or inspite of the law will allow your 
bus to pass the regs, run better, get better gas mileage and pollute less!!  It 
is my fundamental suspicion that the new regs will result in more bus owners 
enjoying said benefits from their buses.
