Subject: Subject: [T2] Friday: a small problem &amp; question
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

One of the early symptoms that my shift coupler was going
south was that the thing started popping when I shifted
into reverse. I took a while but degenerated to the point
where I could only find 3rd and 4rth.... I dont know if
this is your problem but it is pretty easy to check. First
go under an find the thing then clean it off real well
(WD-40 helps) then grab the &quot;cage&quot; assembly and work it
around ( have the bus in nuetral first). On mine, once I
cleaned it off, it was obvious that the shaft that goes
into the tranny was not following the cage that the shift
linkage mates with. My tranny shaft followed fine foward
and back, hence 3rd an 4rth gears, but didnt follow when I
rotated it. The sleeve with the set screw that is on the
tranny shaft appears to be press fit into the cage and
finally had broke free so it became a free rotation joint
as opposed to what it is supposed to do.
   Any free play at this point in your shift linkage will
generate. wierdness in shifting!

  Worth a look,   Dan
