Huh.
I am new to this conversation, but not new  to enjoying the benefits of the 
archive.
 From what I can tell, the admins have cold feet about copyrights in 
relation to the release of CDROMs, but why does that affect the archives 
that have been online as long as they have without copyright infringement 
incident...

May I suggest that the policy for new subscribers to the list be that they 
have to &quot;click through&quot; a page that clearly states that their posts are the 
intellectual property of the list and its adminstrators. That will at least 
clear things up for the future of such an archive project.
The archive represents one of the most valuable resources for type2 owners, 
its absence is substantial and its administration is not to be taken lightly.

If this matter is not soon explained / addressed on the list by the admins, 
may I suggest that a new listserv be started, complete with intellectual 
property disclaimers and a &quot;gentlemans board of directors&quot; where several 
people have to confer to make decisions like this.

&gt; &gt;I don't fully understand his reasons, but I understand what he is asking.
&gt; &gt;So I will be taking down the archives.
&gt;
&gt;Hmm. I think I can tell you why. Quite some time back there was
&gt;discussion of selling cds of the archives, to fund the list. Quite a few
&gt;folks pointed out that A: they owned the rights to what they had written;
&gt;and B: they hadn't given anybody permission to sell them for financial
&gt;gain-even for the non-profit support of the list. As I recall, Bob Hoover
&gt;was one of the louder ones of the bunch-and his comments were arguably
&gt;some of the most valuable. The fallout of all this was the removal of
&gt;Hoover's sermons from the t2 website. Not because Hoover didn't trust
&gt;Ken, but rather because other websites were stealing the content and
&gt;providing it without attribution. At the time, the general consensus was
&gt;that there was no way permission could ever be gained from all of the
&gt;persons whose work would be in the cd. Since the job of trying to get
&gt;permission from all of these people was not possible, there were two
&gt;options. 1. publish it, and risk being sued or some such on down the
&gt;line, or 2. don't do it. Obviously the choice at the time was #2.
&gt;
&gt;I don't think it's anything personal. I'd say it's more a case of Ken
&gt;trying to cover his ass in an extremely litigious society. Because of his
&gt;historical involvement with the list, were the archives published in some
&gt;sort of non-free form (I know your time and DB skills aren't free, but
&gt;you're not charging visitors for them, that's the key), Ken would likely
&gt;be named in a lawsuit. As for the issue of them being an online
&gt;searchable archive, I'd expect it's ok because of the precedent set by
&gt;internet newsgroups. When you post to a public place, you are assumed to
&gt;know that your posts could be included in a free online collaboration.
&gt;
&gt;Disclaimers: IANAL, and my recollections could have some factual errors,
&gt;as I believe all of the events I'm mentioning occurred something like 5-6
&gt;years ago. I do however think the above is relatively close to historical
&gt;fact, close enough to gain a general 10,000 foot view...
&gt;
&gt;
