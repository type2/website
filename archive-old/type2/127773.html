Subject: wifey no trusty

I've been personally making repairs on the bus since I bought it 13
months ago (no mechanics used in the making of this bus). My wife and I
are planning to drive up to Timothy Lake in the Mt. Hood National
Forest in a few weeks with our 2 kids, and she'd like my handiwork to
be eye-balled by someone else before we leave. (Ahh... nothing like the
trust of your wife to keep ya all warm and fuzzy while you're laying in
a cold rainpuddle changing the oil..) Is there a Portland OR area shop
that is well trusted by the list? If there's no recommendation, is
there someone out there that would like to check the work in exchange
for, say, helping me through some Mirror Pond or as an extra pair of
hands on your next effort? I'm not done with all the work, but I'll
need to be by the end of the month.

I've done tune-ups, oil changes, swapped out the ALT &amp; dizzy, installed
cooling air flaps, reconstructed the pre-heat system (not used right
now), new seals... stuff like that. I'm in the process of replacing the
fuel lines and the fuel tank venting lines. Once completed, I'll be
checking/maintaining the brakes and replacing the wheel bearings
(unknown age, unknown condition, date/milage of last greasing unknown).
Me like stopping and vehicle control in general, so this will be the
more important of the stuff to be scrutinized. 

TIA, and have a pleasant weekend under or maybe even driving! your
respective type2's. Guess which one I'll be--
