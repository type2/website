Subject: Re: LiMBO/NEATO TTT Directory - anyone use?

I have never used it, and have never had anyone call up, either.   

But if you want C&amp;C (but I don't make coffee), a place to stay the night, a
place to work on the bus, or splitty parts, and you are in the Oly, WA area,
I'm listed in the TTT.

I have rescued a few straggling usually hippy type bus people who passed
through town.
One was a guy with major engine problems in his 68 bus.   Due to time
pressures, I just washed, taken out, stripped, shimmed, and retorqued the
motor, and  replaced the throw out arm of the trans. (In one greasy day!)
  The motor is marginal due to overheating (there were paper towels stuck in
the fan), but could happily run for quite a while.   He just passed back
through Oly last week, stopped by, got his headlight sorted out, and we did
ye olde bumper swappe, as for some reason he has a 66-67 rear bumper on it,
and I had one appropriate for his bus.    And in the meantime it had seen
some serious back road action up in B C.

Another was a guy from India who had a 65 bus that was seriously cr*pped out.
 I forget what it needed.

And sometimes random people stop by as they saw the buses, or heard of us
from someone in town.  I like seeing a cross section of the mobile
transporter nation.
