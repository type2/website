Subject: Re: [T2] Since it's Friday

I had a PETA sticker made up from CafePress. I was thinking about putting it on my Bus, but I really don't like bumper stickers on cars, especially classic vehicles, so I'll probably just tape it to the window.

PETA:

People for the 
Ethical 
Treatment of
Automobiles
