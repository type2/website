Subject: Please help me start this old bus!

what's up list,

I just purchased my first bus ('77 bay) a few days ago and I'm really 
anxious to bring her back to life. The problem is she hasn't ran in half a 
decade and has been sitting as a lawn decoration ever since. I was just 
curious to know if there are certain things I should do to the gas tank and 
the engine (oil change, etc.) before I crank her up...any help is 
grateful...
thanks,
-Aaron
