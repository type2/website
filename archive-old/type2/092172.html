Subject: Re:high oil pressure at op. temp

Quoth Mill M&gt;: &quot;I've got a 9000 mile rebuilt engine and I'm still
running 20-27 Psi at idle, 45-50 at 2500 rpms, 50-65 psi at 3300 rpms,
all at full operating temperatures of 350 CHT and 210 (f) oil temp.&quot;
I've got the &quot;ready to die&quot; 237,000 mi unrebuilt engine- my oil pressure
is 50+ at cold warmup (80 degr), and exactly at 190 deg oil it drops to
30- (oil is split to cooler?) and my pressure at 240 degr is 20.  Scary-
but as a biologist who thinks of &quot;pressure&quot; as &quot;resistance&quot; I also feel
that real high pressures at operating temperature like your rebuild show
aren't necessarily good as it signifies DIFFICULTY (resistance) of the
oil to get on through the bearing clearances and back to the pan.  The
volume control valve at the rear of the galley  of later cases opens as
a bypass to limit max pressure and I wonder if the bearings could be
starved if clearances are too tight.  Did you plastigauge your
clearances of mains and rods?
