Subject: Propane regulator for Westy

The regulator on my 81 leaks. I assume that there must be some sort of
diaphram that has ruptured allowing the gas to escape through the vent. Are
these repaired or simply replaced? I believe Busboys has them, are they the
best source? Am I correct in thinking that it is a simple wrench job to
replace?

Thanks,

Weston
