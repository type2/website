&gt;my 78 with auto tranny, mostly stock FI 2liter
&gt;have been having a problem with intermitent missing at random speeds.
&gt;next on the agenda.
&gt;.  swap out AFM

With respect to Bentley, Muir , Fisher and Wilson, et al., you will
at least pop the cover and look at the trace ?
Voiding all warranties and recalls and other repair procedures in their
proper order ( i often use &quot;random &quot; selection when luck is on my side )
if the circuit board is trash, you can bypass the VOM readings and get
on with the other stuff.
