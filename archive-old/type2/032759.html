Craig -

Are you talking about the fire/heat barrier material inside the engine bay
above the engine? If so, a West Coast Metric salesdude gave me the name of
somebody in Pennsylvania that may have them, but I have long since lost that
name/number.

Remember that this is a firewall, so I'm not sure that I'd put
rubber/wood/combustibles there.

By the way - mine was sagging real bad 'cuz it wasn't clipped in by all of
the funky clips. I drenched it in water, put some plywood over it, and ran
over the plywood with my bus overnight. It's straight and true now.

Call WCM and see if you can get a lead from there.

Good luck -

&gt; busses
