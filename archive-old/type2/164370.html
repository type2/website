Subject: Recommendations for a digital advance timing light...

Hi all,

Thought I'd upgrade my timing light and was looking around for a digital
timing light that you can set the advance and read the tachometer, etc.  There
seems to be lots of 'em out there, and the ones that list a voltage range seem
to be 10 to 16 volts.  I want one that can somehow be used on both my 12 volt
and my 6 volt cars.  Any ideas or recommendations?  If it has to have 12
volts, can you supply power from a portable 12 volt battery but use it to
time/work on a 6 volt system???

Someone out there has encountered this and has a solution...
