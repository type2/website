If your interested in a carb overhaul,, 
Denmiester has been rebushing and then setting up the carbs. I believe he test
fits them to a running engine to dial them in,,

I am pretty sure he can work you out a good deal on Carb re-bushing and/or
rebuilding... He is in Ontario  CANADA..  and you can contact him at

&gt; Haven't a clue where they get them, or what the site was.
&gt; 
&gt; Throttle shafts can be rebushed for around $150 each with a complete
&gt; rebuild. Risk is you don't know how they will perform until you mount and
&gt; try to adjust them. Sometimes no matter how you clean them there is still a
&gt; little piece of grit somewhere that won't let go, and you will suffer
&gt; forever and never get clean running.
