Subject: Yuma Show

Hi Jerry, my name is mark b. (#460 in the az bus club) and I am planning on going to the
yuma show. Unfortunately my system
here at work will not let me post to the type2 list. And I am looking to see if there is
anyone heading down there that may want to
caravan to Yuma. Is there anyway you could ask the list for me? I would greatly appreciate
it. By the way, me and my wife were at
the Corona De Tucson event overnight and just love your hippie bus man, she sooo cool, my
wife wants one like her bad!! :)
Anyways if you could find out if there is a caravan headed there that would be fantastic!
You can post my e-mail for anyone to
respond back to me.  Thanks again, Mark B.  '77 bus 1600cc upright.
