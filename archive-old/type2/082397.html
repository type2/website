Subject: RE: [T2] Engine removal question.

&gt; Yes!!  I've always wondered how some people can claim they removed/
&gt; installed their type4 engine with the tranny in place and fan housing
&gt; attached.  I've NEVER been able to do that.  Back before I started

Hmm, I didn't have any problems after I removed the oil filler
tube, which wasn't fun, so I think next time I'm going to either
removed both the engine and tranny together, or loosen the tranny
to let it sag.

&gt; Tyler, I really doubt that the transaxle's input shaft is coming out -
&gt; you just need more clearance, clarence.  :)

Um, Roger Roger!
