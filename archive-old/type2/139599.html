Subject: Re: [T2] Mallory pics

Gerald,

The pics are good-enuf!  So, can you add anything to what John C. said 
about the &quot;unilite&quot;?

This one appears to be mech advance only...I don't see a vacuum can...

Looks like it has the optical pickup as well.

Was it worth $289 in terms of power..._dot_can you &quot;see&quot; the difference when 
you timed it over a bosch(old or new, I don't care)?

Better gas mileage?
Does it have the grey springs like John talked about?


Why did you spring for it rather than some other dist?


Cheers, dave

&gt; I tried to show how much it blocks the oil pressure sender location but I
&gt; was &quot;shooting blind&quot; just holding the camera inside the engine compartment
&gt; from the back and pushing the button.. You can sort-of see it in a few
&gt; shots but none really shows it from directly above -- and the angle on some
&gt; shots is enough to make you seasick &lt;grin&gt;.
