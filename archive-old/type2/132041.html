&gt; I have one to top that--
&gt; 
&gt; At the local Ryno Hyde dealer he has picture's of a F-150 PU tuck that a
&gt; guy who worked in the woods had them cover the whole outside of the
&gt; truck in it--

there is a guy on the thing list who painted his entire thing with it,
inside and out. i think he used something like 5 gallons of the stuff. then
he painted over it. the whole car is, like, bumpy.

if i can find the link to his site i will post it, it is something to
behold.
