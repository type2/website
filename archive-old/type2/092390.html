&gt; Pull the piston circlips and tap the wrist pins out.

Chris, Thanks for the reply.

*That* is the problem; if only I could pull the circlips and pins. As I wrote 
in my initial post, the cases are split and separated by nearly 3&quot;. This 
means that the pins are down inside the bore where they are inaccessible. 
And, the cases won't rejoin, so I just can't get to the clips and pins.

If i can't get the case halves to rotate back into alignment, I'm going to 
have to hacksaw the rods... all of them, to get the cases apart.

I've taken a break from the job and will wait until I have help tomorrow. I 
think if someone else holds the cases up on end (one set of pistons down) 
maybe I can find what is causing them to lock out of alignment. Then, if i 
can get the cases to rejoin, I can get to the pins.

Cheers/Don
