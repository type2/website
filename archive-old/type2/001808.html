&gt;    On the subject of the poptop seal, anybody have a solution to the
&gt; vibration you sometimes get at highway speeds?


This is caused by a slight gap between the luggage rack and the roof.  You
have three ways that I know of to close the gap.  One is to push the luggage
rack seal just slightly lower on the luggage rack, so it fills the gap
better.  A fraction of an inch may be all it takes, or this solution may not
work at all. Second is to slightly loosen your luggge rack bolts, put some
weight on the luggage rack (get someone to sit on it, for example) and then
tighten them back down again, thereby snugging your luggage rack.  Third is
to replace the seal with a section of poptop seal, which has an insulation
bulb on the inside.  I can provide this inexpensively, but recommend it only
as a last resort, as using an insulation bulb on a luggage rack seal may
somewhat interfere with rainwater drainage, allowing water or moisture to
accumulate between your luggage rack and roof.
