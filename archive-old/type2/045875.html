Hope I am not asking too many ;-)

The pins in the flyweel that line up the pressure plate, there are none in
my new flywheel. Do I pull the old one's? Should these have been supplied?

I seem to remember a tool that goes in one of the trans mounting holes on
the case that interlocks with the flywheel so that bolts can be torqued.
Does any one know where they can be found????? Or another method.
