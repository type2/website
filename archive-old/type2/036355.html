Subject: oil

Heres a dumb question I'm sure, changed the oil the other day looks like
the po used the stuff you put on the case when your rebuilding it to seal
the gaskets around the strainer. I scraped this off but now have the leak
I'm sure he had too. The drain bolt doesnt seem to tighten up all the way,
any ideas on leak stoppage?
