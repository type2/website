Did a lube job on the front axle beam and steering swing arm at the weekend.  Two nipples on the top half of the beam ends.  Two nipples on the bottom half of the beam ends.  One nipple in the centre of the swing arm lever pin housing.  Five in all.  I checked Muir and Haynes books, but they do not state how many grease nipples.  Have I missed any?
Also, when turning the steering wheel and listening close to the column, (bus stationary!) there is an audible rubbing/friction noise from the column by the  indicator/wiper arms.  Is this normal?  I notice a gap around the steering column below the indicator/wiper arms.  Could/should I pour oil in here to lubricate the column?
