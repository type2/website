&gt; Robert,
&gt; 
&gt;     Follow your speedo cable up from the inside of the front wheel. I'm not
&gt; sure where it is on your model, but you will come to a square black box with
&gt; a multi pin connector on it and a white button. Press that button, the light
&gt; will go off. It is a EGR maintance reminder, so it will come back on in
&gt; 30,000 miles.

	On my cars, these boxes have a way of getting disconnected,
bypassed, or thrown away.
 
	which leads me to think, I've never actually seen a working EGR
system on an older car in Iowa. I suppose they are more important in
states that actually test emissions?
