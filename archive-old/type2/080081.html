Subject: 1800 thermostat

Hi All,

I am in the process of assembling the engine in Clementine, after
replacing the heads, and have found that the thermostat that controls
the cooling flaps in the ductwork is fried.

Anyone have a good functioning one that they would be willing to sell?

This is the last hurdle I have and the engine is done.

Thanks Much,

            ______________
