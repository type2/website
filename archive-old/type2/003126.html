.  The
&gt; next place I was going to look was a motorcycle repair
&gt; shop because non of the auto parts stores around here
&gt; (Arlington, VA) have a clue.

Bob,

   One easy place to get any kind of fuel system part including fuel line
and high quality valves is a company called Aircraft Spruce and Specialty
Co. I know this because I am into airplane building. They have a catalog an
inch thick! They have a web site at www.aircraft-spruce_dot_com .
  I have often thought it would be a great idea to install a fuel valve
between the tank and the fuel pump and filter to avoid getting another fuel
bath.
