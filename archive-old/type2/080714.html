Subject: Re: [T2] Locking filler door

Makes since. I have seen many a split bus gas flap bent by a thief who was
to dumb to know he could stick his screw driver in the &quot;key hole&quot; and open
it a lot more easily than he could rip the flap back. They aren't apposed to
doing body damage to your vehicle.

&gt; If you really want to use a locking gas cap rather than modifying your
door,
&gt; just take your tank to a radiator shop or welding shop, with the neck to a
&gt; tank that will accept a locking cap.  A reputable shop can handle this
kind
&gt; of modification, and you won't have to put a hole in the sheet metal.
Plus,
&gt; IF someone wanted in there that bad, at least they'd screw up a cheap cap,
&gt; rather than tear up your fuel door and fender.
&gt;
&gt; Just a thought.

&gt; &gt; &gt;This leads me to my next question. Has anyone ever fabricated a lock
for

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sure, I've seen lots of clasp hinges with padlocks.  I can't believe
&gt; anyone
&gt; &gt; would be so crude.  If you must have a locking door, you can get nice
lock
&gt; &gt; mechanisms for a few bucks at the hardware store that only require a
small
&gt; &gt; round hole be cut into the door and perhaps a small L-bracket mounted to
&gt; &gt; the body inside the door.  I'd still rather not have a lock - I'd rather
&gt; &gt; have someone steal all 15 gallons of gas than take a screwdriver to my
&gt; &gt; locked filler door and do $200 worth of body damage.  As for people who
&gt; &gt; like to dump stuff in gas tanks, they are rare enough that I don't worry
&gt; &gt; about it.
