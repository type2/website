Subject: Electrical Problem

Hello Everyone.   With the help of various list members I reattached the
left side running light and replaced the broken plastic clips with
plastic nuts and bolts.  (thanks to all who replied)  Now I have a
strange electrical problem.  Before I started the above task I noticed
the right side rear running light was out so I bought a bulb to replace
it.  Unfortunately the new bulb does not work either.  I put a volt
meter on the contacts without the bulb and got a 12V reading so I know I
am getting juice.  I then put the bulb back in and  connected the
voltmeter to the contacts from the back side and it reads zero.  As soon
as I take the bulb off the contacts it reads 12v again.  I then took the
bulb out and placed the positive and negative wires to the respective
contacts on the bulb itself, no dice.  I know the bulb is working
because I tested it on the other side and it lights up just fine.  Also
the bulb is definitely making contact with the plates in the socket.
Any suggestions??
Thanks in advance,
