&gt; Well, boat folks have tanks in all sorts of sizes and shapes.  Check out:
&gt; Click on Engine Systems and then Fuel Tanks.  It will yield dozens of
&gt; different plastic tanks, one of which might fit the tank space of a bus.

yeah I have been playing with their tanks with the idea of putting in a
larger sized tank, there is quite a bit of space in that recess that is
extra.  but I suspect that space is for safety reasons and the hassles of
putting in a guage and the fill tube etc etc sort of pushed this to the
back burner......
