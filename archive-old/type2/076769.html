GEX also seems to be the master of the &quot;service limits&quot; rebuild.
Basically, if a part is less than 100% worn out it is good enough for
them.  They give a 15K warranty and hope that the engine lasts that long
or that the teenybopper will sell their VW before the motor goes.  On the
first and last GEX engine I bought I managed to get 40K miles in a very
well maintained bug with a perfect cooling system.  The engine had low oil
pressure from day 1.  The &quot;new&quot; heads had mismatched valve stem heights.

Jake and Boston Bob are the people to talk to.  If they weren't around,
I'd put a Subaru in my bus before I'd buy anything from GEX.
