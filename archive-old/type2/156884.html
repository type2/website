Subject: Re: [T2] starter problem?

Well, I don't have a relay.  And it's only done that one  time.  But in the several years that I've owned the bus, I've  never had the hot start problem I've heard everyone talking  about.  Wonder why?  I'm going to keep an eye on it.   Cheers...KR

It was rare, rare in the Bus. I did have a hot start relay. It would 
click so I knew it was working but no starter action.
