Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical problems 70 bus

On Tue, 09 Dec 2003 15:44:06 -0600 
Martin Van Tassel said something about [T2] Electrical problems 70 bus:

&gt; The next day, I turned the key and the warning lights in the dash come
&gt; on in 
&gt; the first position, but in the start position I get 1 click from the 
&gt; soleniod and nothing.  Then I can't get the warning lights or interior 

&gt; I've removed the stereo completely, removed the added wiper switch,
&gt; removed the instrument panel and cleaned and inspected all wires and
&gt; connections.  All the fuses are intact and I've studied the wiring
&gt; diagram checking each wire for damage.  I even pulled the ignition switch
&gt; when I could get the warning lights to come on and with the battery fully
&gt; charged put a jumper from the red wire to red/black wire going to the
&gt; starter.  The starter did then give 1 click and all the lights went out
&gt; again.  

You're working on the wrong end of the bus.

Go back and remove/clean the ground strap from the battery where it
connects to the body.

Now, crawl underneath (maybe jack up the passenger side a bit for easier
access) and check the tightness of all the wires on the starter solenoid.
If they're loose, remove them, clean them, put them back on. Use a spider
washer under them to hel get good contact.

**DO NOT** over tighten the nut on the starter solenoid. It is not attached
to anything inside the cap as it is just a contactor point. It is simply
embedded in the bakelite cap. The cap WILL break if you wrench on that nut
too hard. Then you get to pull the starter and replace it.
