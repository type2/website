Subject: Re: [T2] misses on acceleration + water from the tailpipe

Part of the result of burning gasoline is the production of water vapor which 
condenses in the exhaust pipe and drips out.  Some mufflers have a small hole 
so water can escape.  This is normal.

&gt; On my way back from NJ to NC my bus was missing. It was like it would 
&gt;  sputter. It would only happen at high speeds and only when I was giving it 
&gt;  gas. The more gas I was giving the more likely it was to happen. It 
wouldn't 
&gt; 
&gt;  do it non stop, but every couple of seconds. It was not evenly spaced.
&gt;  Also, I noticed that water keeps dripping from my tail pipe. I have seen 
&gt;  this on other cars before and was not sure what the deal is. Does it have 
to 
&gt; 
&gt;  do with humidity, or is it something to be concerned about?
