Subject: misfire testing results

Ok, so I did some more testing on the car today.  Btw, during these 
test, I would throttle it up to around 2500 to make the thumps more 
pronounced.

So, I pulled the #3 injector, bump kinda went away, but still every now 
and then.  Put #3 back and pulled #4 injector.. bump kinda went away, 
still a few here an there.  Pulled both, ran smooth as butter even 
though it was running only on 2 cylinders.  Then I put #3 and #4 back 
and pulled #1 and #2 and it ran kinda crappy on that side (not as well 
as running on #1 and #2 and there were a few thumps here and there.

So, I'm thinking maybe an exhaust leak on the driver's side?  Any 
thoughts on what to do next?

thanks,
Mike
