Here is an even better site that talks about heat and polymers.
http://www.vtr_dot_org/maintain/lubricants-redline.html
Click on 'Viscosity Index Improvers' and then remember all the people that
say ''my engine runs at 250 etc''.

This site almost echoes what the 2nd site below says:
http://www.eskimo_dot_com/~dalus/bmw/all/misc/all_oilfaq.html


&gt; First,
&gt; it is a misnomer and unscientific to say oil breaks down. Remember, it was
&gt; tremendous heat and pressure that made the oil in the first place. It's
been
&gt; around in one form for millions of years and remains as it is.  In use,
&gt; engine oil becomes contaminated and sludge-like in direct proportion to
the
&gt; initial quality of processing, combined with heat and combustion
byproducts.
&gt; In the 70's thru the 90's, I could always tell the Castrol 20W50 customers
&gt; when they came in...and they claimed 3K-mile oil change intervals.  Those
&gt; and the Pennsoil users all had the most sludge built up on the rocker
area.
&gt; More paraffin left in the base oil during the refining process was
&gt; supposedly one of the culprits. Inferior additives/polymers (by today's
&gt; standards) that break down under heat complicated matters.  Valvoline 30wt
&gt; users were among the cleanest motors as evidenced by internal components
&gt; upon rebuilding.  A/C VWs are probably one of the best measures of an
oil's
&gt; true quality.
&gt;
&gt; Many newer oils hold combustion byproducts in better suspension, but I
still
&gt; like changing the oil at 3K-mile intervals. Under normal use, that remains
&gt; the best guarantee your oil is doing its job.  With quality filtering,
&gt; synthetics are a better option than additives.  Jeff Raven's reference has
&gt; interesting info on additives and lawsuits
&gt;  http://www.geocities_dot_com/chrislonghurst/engineoil_bible.html
&gt; http://www.repairfaq_dot_org/filipg/AUTO/F_oil_facts.html is another good
&gt; resource that states: &quot;The wide viscosity range oils, in general, are more
&gt; prone to viscosity and thermal breakdown due to the high polymer content.
It
&gt; is the oil that lubricates, not the additives. Oils that can do their job
&gt; with the fewest additives are the best&quot;
&gt;
&gt; 20w50 simply cannot protect as well as 40wt in hot climates.  The 40wt has
&gt; NO multi-viscosity polymers to break down under heat.  Again synthetics
are
&gt; an exception here. Your test might prove something if engine oil just sat
in
&gt; one place over a stove burner, but it doesn't do that.  My base oil
&gt; temperature never gets above 240.  I cringe at the thought of 280-degree
&gt; oil.
