Subject: Re: [T2] re: solar power fridge

just a brief note.  i don't know anything about the draws etc.
at bbb8 a guy showed up in a vanagon adventurewagen. had the stock adv. wagen fridge 
which i believe is bigger than the westfalia version.  had about 6 assorted size 
solar panels on top of his roof and around it. they could be adjusted to get the max 
sun manually. with hinged supports.
he lives in his bus about 5 months of the year and has for about 10 years.  he runs 
his fridge and what ever else he wants. low volume tunes and a regular electric 
toaster every day.  he goes to the southwest for the winter and this is where he 
maintains this usage.  he didn't know how much wattage he had on the roof or the draw 
or really anything except 'it was enough'.  i think the panels were at least 50 and 
no more than 75 each.

mostly it shows that you don't have to be an expert or have the most matched sets or 
highest priced or most efficient units to make it all work.

joaquim if you are interested i probably have pictures of his bus, let me know.
