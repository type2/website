&gt; anytime that i rev my engine up real hi, it sounds like their is a

&gt; rev's. I have a stock 72 with the 1700cc type4 engine. Thanks

is this the same sound you heard before? What have you checked since
your last post if it is. Check the valves &amp; compression. Also try to
use a screwdriver (like Ben said) to find where the sound is actually
coming from.
