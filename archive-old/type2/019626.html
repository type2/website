I know this sounds crazy and simple, but check your battery terminals. 
My terminals were badly corroded on my 76 2.0Fi and I couldn't use any
accessories or start.  I changed the starter (then changed it back),
checked the wiring, ignition.. got a new battery, everything.  I
couldn't figure it out for about a year.  Sometimes, especially when it
rained, the electricity would go out on me, then come back.  Then, when
I replaced the terminals harnesses, it was all back to normal.

Later,
Mike

&gt; I’m going to try to explain my problem, but please forgive my ability to
&gt; describe it better.  I have a 74 Transporter (no FI) that has been subject
&gt; to visits from the very scary Lurch.  Lurch first attacked us only hours
&gt; after meeting.  We were on the Interstate during a 5 hour trip (3 hours in).
&gt;   My headlights would dim, and I would lose nearly all power until finally
&gt; having to shift into first to rev the motor out the roof.  After hitting
&gt; first, I was always able to get more speed and return to normal speed for a
&gt; while until Lurch joined us again, always near an exit where I would usually
&gt; pull off with a 100% dead bus.  The motor usually wouldn’t start again until
&gt; after a long sit.  Well, I:
&gt; 
&gt;      Bought a new AVP longblock (1800cc with hydraulic lifters!) I have not
&gt; yet installed
&gt;      Installed a Pertonix ignition
&gt;      Replaced the starter and solenoid
&gt;      Replaced the battery
&gt;      Replaced the spark plugs
&gt;      Installed a hard start relay
&gt;      Used Chemtool to clean my fuel system,  AND
&gt; 
&gt; I already had a:
&gt; 
&gt;      New distributor and plug wires
&gt;      New fuel pump
&gt;      New Weber progressive
&gt;      New alternator, BUT
&gt; 
&gt; Lately the bus has been sputtering on acceleration (while making a chirpy
&gt; sound through the exhaust) and LURCH joined us once again tonight on the way
&gt; home from the grocery (note: coldest night since spring).  Oh it was
&gt; frightening.  The Lurch was truly dreaded this time.  I put the bus into
&gt; neutral, and revved the motor to high rpm’s for a while, and then Lurch
&gt; left, but the sputtering continued.  It always feels like the engine is
&gt; badly flooded or something and that by revving it I’m unflooding the system.
&gt;   Does that make sense? Anyone have any hints?  Do I have to install the
&gt; longblock to eliminate all mechanical possibilities?  Help me keep faith in
&gt; my VW addiction. Oh please! Oh please!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Dustin
