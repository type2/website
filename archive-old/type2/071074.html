Dear Electrical Wizards,

I was not aware that I had any electrical problems except that I need a new 
relay for the high beam.  Tonight after dark when I went to park my '68 
crewcab, I noticed that the high beam indicator light and the dash lights 
were on (actually only 1 of 3 since the others are burned out), with the head 
light switch all the way in.  When I put it in the parking light position, 
the dash lights went out, but the high beam indicator light stayed on, and 
the parking lights came on normally.  With the switch in the fully out 
position, the headlights came on, the dash lights stayed out, and the high 
beam indicator stayed on.  When I started it, all was normal, including the 
turn signals, except for the above.  I was able to turn off the dash lights 
by rotating the dimmer, but the indicator light stayed on.  At least that 
shouldn't kill the battery.

The bus was in the shop a week ago.  Among the things the mechanic checked 
were the turn signals and high beams.  He replaced the relay for the turn 
signals, and ordered a new relay for the high beams.  I don't think I have 
driven after dark since then, so this condition may have been since them.  I 
will probably pull the instrument panel this weekend and unplug the high beam 
indicator light.  Other than that, I don't know where to start.  Any 
suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks, David Hunt '68 Crewcab &quot;LugBug&quot;
