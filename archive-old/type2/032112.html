Subject: Re: [T2] Re: seat belts

&gt; I too used vanagon belts from a junkyard, but did not make any l bracket
&gt; behind the driver- just mount it right to the bulkhead wall behind the
&gt; seat, bolt at the bottom, belt outlet up.

Let me recall... That is how they are mounted in a Vanagon, isn't it? Not
at floor level, but halfway up the bulkhead? I've wondered two things
about that:

1- Would they be long enough, if mounted on the floor with a bracket in a
Westy?

2- If I mounted them to the bulkhead too, how would I make the point of
attachment suitably strong? I didn't want to get into a welding project,
but it seems that the point of attachment on the floor has a welded nut
beneath it or something to give it extra strength. I was afraid of just
drilling a hole in the bulkhead (into relaitvely thin sheet metal maybe?)
to mount them in the Westy.

What do you think?
