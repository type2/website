Subject: Re: [T2] She doesn't want to go camping?!

Hiya Todd,

Boy!  Do I sympathize with you.  My wife is the same way.  Roughing it for 
her would be a Motel 6.  Camping in the Bus - No way.

However,  eventually she will go camping and in the Bus.  You see, the 
solution to this little dilemma is to plan carefully and not rush the question.  
Notice the word in the first sentence of this paragraph - eventually.

Planning carefully?  Think of ALL the complaints she might have concerning 
camping and the Bus.  Have good (for her) solutions in hand before she voices 
those complaints.  For example, my wife is really picky about showers.  In my 
state (Oregon) we have a great state park system with really nice showers in 
many of the parks.  Solution for this problem?  I'll take the better half to a 
few of our nicer state parks and let her take a look at the shower facilities.

Yep, it'll take time.  And my wife will have a lot of other complaints.  And 
each one will take a while to resolve.  But we'll get there - eventually.  One 
just has to be patient and persevere.

By the way, I really liked a couple of previous ideas.  The camping in the 
driveway is really good as a shakedown kinda experience.  But I'd still go 
through with my advice above before I attempted it.  And emphasizing the 
&quot;togetherness&quot; is a strong motivator.  I'm going to have to incorporate both of those 
ideas in my &quot;game plan&quot;

Best of luck Todd!  Maybe I'll see you and your wife at a campground sometime 
in the future.

Mike
