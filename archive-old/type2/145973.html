&gt; I recall that these would fit on a bus, does memory
&gt; serve me right? I found a set of 4 with tires locally

&gt;    It's not just a bolt-on...The M-B rims are set up for
lug bolts (like the wide-five VW's) so you've got to
1. Open up the lug holes in the rims one step up with
     a drill bit or reamer.
2. I used a ball grinder to create a depression in the
     face of the lug holes. The M-B lug bolts seat flat
     to the hole; the VW lug nuts are mushroom shaped.
3. Unless you mark the two rear rims, a bit of the back
     face hasta be hogged out to clear the 10mm bolt
     head on the face of the brake drum. Mark the rim
     with something (I used a dab of paint) so the little
     gouge in the back of the rim lines up over the bolt
     head.
4. Luckily my buddy's a mechanic and had a bunch of
     lug bolts on his &quot;why-am-I-keeping-all-this-stuff&quot;
     shelves...We found enough lug bolts to replace the
     stock VW ones. They were about a half inch longer
     than the stock ones. Unless you use longer lug bolts,
     there isn't quite enough thread for the nuts. I have
     no idea where the lug bolts came from, tho'...
5. Unless you go for chrome lug nuts or plastic caps,
     a cheap alternative is 1/2 inch pvc caps painted in
     your choice of color. About $.05 at your local plumb-
     ing supply house.

6. I'm still looking for someone(s) who have four or five
     broken VW hood emblems from a type 1 they'd like
     to get rid of... ;-)
