Subject: cooling system for 78 Westy

&gt;&gt;My &quot;significant other&quot; insists that I don't need all the cooling tins; he
suggests mounting fans in the engine compartment would keep the engine cool
and help the hot air exit out of the compartment.&lt;&lt;

With all due respect, your SO hasn't a clue.  Your bus already has a fan
that is properly engineered to keep the engine cool...provided that the
cooling tin and thermostatic controls are in place.  There is no need (or
expertise from the sound of it) to re-engineer a perfectly functional and
effective design.
