Subject: Re: [T2] TRW Steering Box

Actually &quot;Worm &amp; Peg&quot; Steering Boxes are what was originally installed on
the 68-72 Bay Window.  You can use the 73-79 Worm &amp; Roller, but a bit of
modifying is needed I believe.  Upgrading to the later Pittman Arm is one
thing you have to do (the output shaft is larger).

Check with Walter at Bus Boys.  I believe they were the only ones to offer
new 73-79 boxes, but that was awhile back.  Or get a fresh rebuilt from
them.

&gt; &gt;Is there a logical reason why TRW hasn't made a steering box for the
&gt; 'soon
&gt; &gt;to fail' worm and roller steering box for the '68-'72 baywindow bus?
&gt; Probably because they are available new and are fitted to the Brazil
&gt; buses.
