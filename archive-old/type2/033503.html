Subject: Looking for something to do to your bus?

Hello List,

If you're afraid of your windshield rust or if you're tired of being
nauseated while setting your timing read ahead..  I just completed a few
projects on my '77 Westfalia that I'd like to share.

Windshield rust good bye, I cut the old windshield seal out from the inside
and the windshield just fell out.  Then I sanded, applied phosphoric acid
(Naval jelly, eats rust), and did body filler (Bondo) all around the rusted
parts of the windshield channel.  Primered it, put my new windshield seal
(busdepot) on the windshield and preformed the windshield trick: lay a
strong piece of nylon string in the channel of the seal (now on the
windshield) that lips around the ledge in the body (the channel does, holds
the windshield from falling out) and wet the seal, in that channel, with
soapy water to lubricate it.  Overlap the string about 6 inches.  Hold the
windshield to the car and zip the string out from the inside thus pulling
the seal's channel over the ledge in the body.  Took a day and the
windshield didn't break!  I called Safelite glass to do it for me and the
guy said I could save some steps by doing it myself.  Uh, okay.  Well, it
worked!

The other thing I did was install a $99 catalytic converter (busdepot, the
kind that goes on Vanagons) between my Y-pipe and muffler (original exhaust
system).  For me it was worth it just to not have to smell noxious exhaust
fumes.  With the cat the exhaust smells like a clear summer mountain.  And
my power seems to have increased, I guess my old one piece muffler must have
been clogged up!  Call me 'Friend of the Environment'.

I'll answer questions if anyone has any.
