Sounds like it could be the fuel regulator. Check the vacuum hose that come
off the regulator.

Subject: [T2] Gas in the Oil


&gt; Hello All, (Happy New Year too!)
&gt;
&gt; I have been working on this problem for a little while with help from the
&gt; archives and my Bently manual.
&gt;
&gt; I have a poor sense of smell but the oil leak under my car and the full
&gt; dipstick means that either the oil fairies visit me at night or I have gas
&gt; entering the system to make up for the lost oil.  The oil also seems thin
&gt; too.
&gt;
&gt; After reading the archives and the manuals I have done some testing on the
&gt; fuel system.  The diagnostics that I have done (or not done) are:
&gt;
&gt; A compression test when I bought the van about 7 months ago (it was good
in
&gt; the 110-120's) but I have not rechecked.
&gt; Tested the cold start valve for leakage.
&gt; Got a fuel pressure tester and the results are that the pressure in the
ring
&gt; does read around 35 psi after a cranking the starter.  If left, the
pressure
&gt; drops to about 32-30 PSI in 10 minutes and 20 psi in maybe 25 minutes.
&gt; Maybe a bit less.
&gt;
&gt; I pulled all the injectors, operated them, and looked for leaks.  I did
not
&gt; find any drips at all on these, which makes me a bit suspicious that I was
&gt; not doing them right as the manuals both say 2 drips a minute are OK.  Or
no
&gt; drips the ideal anyway?
&gt;
&gt; Then I checked the cold start valve again because I like the torture of
&gt; taking it off.  Still no leaks.
&gt;
&gt; Finally, I put the injectors back in and the cold start valve and started
&gt; the engine with the gauge still hooked up to the ring.  It flutters from
&gt; about 36 PSI to 42PSI.  This is with the vacuum hose connected AND
without.
&gt; To be honest I did not check the connection that well as it was getting
dark
&gt; and cold by then. The hose that I connected was from on top of the air
&gt; intake to the fuel pressure regulator.  It had a T connector at the
&gt; regulator but the other hose has gone so I eliminated the T while I was
&gt; testing it. It is at least a tight as me other connections but that is not
&gt; saying a lot at this point.
&gt;
&gt; The last test seems like very high pressure readings for the ring. It is
&gt; supposed to be around 28 PSI right?  Could a highly pressured ring cause
the
&gt; gas in the oil by causing the injectors to inject too much gas?
&gt;
&gt; More background:  The car is a 79 westie, with a 2.0 liter FI and I use it
&gt; mostly on short city trips (10 minutes to and from work).
&gt;
&gt; Any advice of other strategies for testing?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Graham Facer
&gt; 79 Westy
