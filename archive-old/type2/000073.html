Subject: Carver P4 Propane Furnaces on the way.
Message-ID: &lt;0.64d1b662.2538fc13_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have a shipment of Carver P4 propane furnaces on the way from the UK.

I will have these ready to ship within 2 weeks, and I'm now taking orders.  I 
already have most of them sold.

Check out my website for more information, and let me know you're a 
listmember to receive a discount.
