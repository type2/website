Subject: RE: [T2] Pertronix installation help

Hi Jason,

I had a similar problem on my 1979 Westy, but managed to push the sleeve 
down the last 1/4&quot; that makes everything fit well.  Granted, I'm probably 
using a different distributor, but I DID have a problem getting the sleeve 
down all the way.  It was a REALLY tight fit, but I managed to push it on 
without ruining anything.  With the sleeve as far down as I thought, my 
rotor would not fit.  With the sleeve down as far as it should be, there was 
no space between the bottom of the rotor and the sleeve.

One thing to try is to mark the top of the sleeve on the dizzy shaft when 
it's pushed down as far as it will go. Then, measure how thick the plastic 
is on the top of the sleeve.  If the &quot;pushed down&quot; measurement is more than 
the thickness of the plastic, it's not down all the way.

If that doesn't work, you may be SOL with that dizzy.  If so, I hear that 
Bosch makes a great dizzy called the 009 that will make your bus run like a 
dragster....  :-D

Good Luck!
