Subject: Anyone need a diesel head?

I'm not sure if the head of an 81 Jetta Diesel would fit the diesel engine
in a vanagon, but if it does and anyone needs one (or for another VW
application), I'm cleaning out my garage and have my head and cam from my
old car that got totaled in an accident, but the engine was still running
like a charm. For some reason I took the head off it, thinking one day I may
use it, but it's been like 8 years and I haven't used it. So anyone need
one? It's free but you gotta pay shipping from 06095.

Thanks!
