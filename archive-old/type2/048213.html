Several years ago the cooling fan on the 1600SP in our '68 Campmobile died,
and took a long time doing so.

We'd go for days and days with everything just fine, and then conditions
would be just &quot;right&quot; [or wrong, actually] and we'd suddenly get an unholy
racket from the back that'd stand your hair on end.  If the bus was pulled
over for a frantic inspection nothing could be found amiss and the racket
would be gone before we even got stopped.

This went on for several weeks, and we finally found that pulling hard in
2nd gear on a really steep hill would trigger the commotion.  Apparently
just the right combination of harmonics and gravity was necessary.

When we pulled the fan housing apart we found that the cooling fan was
completely free of its hub.  Most of the time the 2 parts had hooked up
enough to shove the air around.  Only when the bus was angled up a steep
incline, at relatively low engine revs, would the 2 parts lose their
connection and allow the main part of the fan to rub on the inside of the
fan housing.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  When my fan hub was cracked it seemed fine when turned by hand and
sounded scary when connected. The only way I was SURE it was from the
fan/gen area was to run it with the belt off. It really wont do any harm if
you do it for a bit.  &lt;&lt;
