Subject: Need new/rebuilt 2 liter engine for '77 Westy

I am the proud owner of a 1977 Westfalia whose 2 liter engine has decided to
wear out 25000 miles after a rebuild.

Before going the rebuild route again, I want to see what my options are,
i.e., is it possible to buy a new long block (hecho en Mexico?) in the US
and install, or what.

Given that I live in Hillsboro (Portland) Oregon, I have a bias in favor of
Northwest suppliers.

Anyone have any good ideas as to where I can get a new long block or good
reliable rebuild.
