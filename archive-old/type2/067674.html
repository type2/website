I totally forgot about checking the price on that....sorry... I'll find it next
time I go in (Aisle 54, Row 2, Shelf 6) and get the price... If you're in a
hurry you can give me a call at work (810)373-2300 and I'll look it up right
away, if I'm not there you can ask for Glen, who is the biggest bus freak
I know...

&gt;I believe that we sell trailer hitches for all buses 72 and up...
&gt;I send you a part number and price next time I go into work...

Brian,
Please post to the list when you find out; There's a lot of interest right
now.
BTW, don't forget that a hitch that fits a '73 won't necessarily fit a '72,
especially if it's attached to the bumper.
TIA!
