&gt; can anyone give me a ballpark value of an all original 80,000 repainted
once no rust not hacked up 1971 westy. has been owned by second owner
(little old man) since 72'. the westy is in toronto (in rust belt) so i
would expect to pay more than say Cali. regional price comparison's would 
be interesting

I would go to $3000USD if I liked it enough
