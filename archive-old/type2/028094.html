Subject: Re: Oil temp sender under pressure relief valve?
Message-ID: &lt;KDFCMIIEFAEKCAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

I had a sender under the pressure relief valve in my '64 bus. I also had one in the sump plate. I wired these to a toggle switch and then to the same gauge so I could compare readings. The sender under the pressure relief valve consistently read hotter, but I believe it gave me a more accurate reading in terms of general case/oil temperature. If I recall correctly, it was consistently about 8 degrees higher than the sump plate sender. I reported on this to the vintagebus list, so an archive search might reveal the exact numbers.

I removed the pressure relief valve sender before I sold the '64. Unfortunately, it will not fit in the pressure relief spring fitting in the Type 4 engine I'm building, so it's a surplus part. I haven't figured out how I will add an oil temp sender to this engine, but I consider an oil temp gauge and an oil pressure gauge essential additions to any bus I own.

Good luck! Joe
