Subject: Re: [T2] Hard Starting When Cold

Jason,

ok, this points out why it is difficult to do help over the net&lt;grin&gt;.

If someone actually &quot;heard&quot; the engine start, they might 
say...Whoa!...your starter is just *not* turning th engine over fast 
enough to really get it going quickly....Had this problem with a 
F**d...replaced the battery and it started in about 1/2 of a crank.

Obviously, you have already replaced your battery, so that is probably not 
the cause...what about the wires and cables going to your 
starter?...cleaned/tightened?

The test I suggested yesterday(the starter fluid) will tell you a whole 
lot about what is going on very easily....

If you use it and the engine starts &quot;more instantly&quot;....then the 
starter/battery is probably not the cause....something on the fuel side is 
probably not working well.  So, with one or two squirts, you can diagnose 
a whole lot of stuff.

You **did** see the very nice link to how much battery power is required 
thru bad cables vs. good cables that Richard posted last week???

Sample scenario...starter is pulling so much from the battery that the 
fuel pump can't push fuel correctly.  The test?  Pre-load the fuel ring by 
using the pencil on the afm flapper trick.  *Then* try and start.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Richard,
&gt; 
&gt; The battery is new (about 4 weeks old), and I make sure to drive the Bus 
&gt; long enough to charge the battery well.  The spark plugs, wires, cap, and 
&gt; rotor are all new (also 4 weeks old).  The fuel, oil, and air filters are 
&gt; all new.  The gas tank was drained before the Bus was put up for storage.  
&gt; The alternator was replaced 2 years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; It's been about 30F here in WNC the past several days, and I've noticed no 
&gt; difference in harder starting than when it was warm.  That is, my engine had 
&gt; the same problem 2 weeks ago when it was 50F in the morning.  Incidentally, 
&gt; even before this rebuild, it took 8 pulses to start.
&gt; 
&gt; That's the thing that's frustrating me -- the engine makes great power, it 
&gt; doesn't stumble or bog, the gauges read correctly (oil press &amp; temp, CHT &amp; 
&gt; vac, volts, tach), the heads are brand new, and the bottom end is far from 
&gt; used up (only 26k).  I just can't get it to start easily.

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks anyway,
