Here's my opinion on that bus..
If you can buy it and get it to your place for $250, buy it.
If nothing else, you will get parts off of it, either to sell or to keep for
the next bus. You may well be able to sell some for enough to pay for the
project, and still have enough left over for the project that you will do
later on, maybe on another bus. You did say that it has all the camper
guts.. right?
Miracles do happen, and not infrequently, dreams do come true. If you
believe you can do it, and you want it bad enough (but have the patience and
sticktoitiveness to put it all together), it can happen. There is nothing
that can be imagined that cannot be done.
If you want the bus, buy it, as long as the price is reasonable. As you get
into it, you'll know better what you want to do and where you want to go
with it. If nothing else, you can learn on this one and probably break even
on the money.. just don't pay too much.
