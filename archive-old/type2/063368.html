Hey People,
    I have a problem. When my '68 bus is idleing sometimes the oil 
light comes on. If I rev up the engine it goes off, but it has me 
seriously nervous. I have plenty of oil in the case. Is this a sign of a
bad oil pump? Or is it maybe a sign that I should replace my oil sensor?
It doesn't seem to do it after the engine has warmed up a bit, but I
think it's getting worse.
