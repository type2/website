At 10:14 AM 7/9/2002, you wrote:
&gt; &gt;Of course, your other option for the heads would be to replace them
&gt;with bus
&gt;2.0 heads and sell the 914 ones on eBay for more than enough to cover
&gt;the new
&gt; &gt;bus ones :)
&gt;
&gt;Of course, there goes all your power. Those 914 2.0 heads had huge
&gt;valves and were killer. Be glad to trade you my Type4 2.0 heads if you
&gt;decide to go that way ;&gt;)

How do you know that the larger valves made more power?  The dynamometer 
showed that I picked up power by going to smaller valves in my 2.0.  The 
Porsche valves also have larger stems than the bus valves.  The stems are a 
major hindrance to airflow in general, and bigger stems are a bigger 
hindrance.  If I had to guess, I'd guess that the larger valves and stems 
were put in more for reliability than power.

I think the Porsche engine makes so much more power primarily because of a) 
higher compression and b) more aggressive camshaft profile, but I have no 
proof of that either so I put it forth as opinion only.  :)
