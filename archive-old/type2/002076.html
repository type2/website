Unless you have California emmissions (which requires a cat), you can just
replace your stock setup with the similar-to-stock-looking Pacesetter
exhaust system.  This system costs $79 complete, has the port for the egr
filter, and does away with the crossover pipe completely.  Not quite as
substantial as the German system, but not too bad for the price, and roughly
equally quiet.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hello!
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have an exhaust crossover pipe for a '77 bus?  I
&gt; believe it was
&gt; the same for years 75.5 through 78.  This is the pipe that connects the
&gt; right heat exchanger box to the elbow where the EGR and muffler
&gt; hooks up on
&gt; the left side.  The local junk yard gave me a blank look.
&gt;
&gt; TIA,
&gt; Christopher
