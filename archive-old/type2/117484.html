&gt; The best thing for rain is to bring the Blue Sky with you... I now own 
&gt; a HUGE custom 15x20 awning we call the &quot;Blue Sky&quot; that sets up quick 
&gt; and it's tall enough to park a bus underneath with the roof up if you 
&gt; wanted to. When taken down the poles ride in a carrier mounted on the 
&gt; jack posts and the connector brackets half-fill a milk crate.

Yeah I got one of those, not as big as Gregs but a lot easier for me to
handle alone

&gt; The other indispensable item in my campsite setup is the westrailer. 
&gt; It's a small box trailer with a shortened bus pop-top that has an 
&gt; integrated kitchen with 10 square feet of countertop plus about 45 
&gt; cubic feet of storage space. This means we only need to keep the 
&gt; lunch/beverage cooler in the bus and all the other camping gear can be 
&gt; kept in the trailer. The bus stays a lot more organized with the 
&gt; westrailer following behind.

now the Westrailer is one slick item,  gotta get me one of those,  wonder
how it would look in Metalic Blue???

&gt; I couldn't get my own inventory under control, so I built the 
&gt; westrailer. Your milage may vary.

LOL  know the feeling
