Subject: Re: [T2] Oil - I give up

On 7/26/02, perring_at_pdq_dot_net thus spake:

&gt;I have lost my listing of recommended SAE/API oil viscosities as they 
&gt;relate to outside temperatures.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody got a web URL ??

Here's the text and a scan of the image from Bentley:

&lt;http://www.hintz_dot_org/oilfaq.html&gt;

But to be honest I believe that the info is a bit out of date-oil
manufacturing has come a long way since the Bently was written from what
I understand. But you can't go wrong with their specs I guess.

Peace,
