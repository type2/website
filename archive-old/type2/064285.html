Subject: 74 bus: removing ignition lock 

I'm having trouble with my ignition lock, it hangs up and won't move to the
start position. The trouble is in the lock, not in the electrical switch.
After much consternation, I got the lock housing (the cast metal piece that
houses the lock as well as guides the steering shaft) out of the bus and
took it to a locksmith. They said they would replace the cylinder for $50.
How do I know if the problem is in the lock cylinder or in the steering
column locking mechanism? The dealer wants $125 for the lock mechanism w/o
the lock cylinder. Don't want to spend that much. Plus I can't see any way
to get the lock mechanism out of the housing. I've removed the two screws
(per Bentley) and the geomotries of the pieces are such that something else
has to be removed to remove the lock mechanism. Anyone done this before?
