&gt; ... Some PO took off the fuel injection and replaced
&gt; it with some single carb.--you haven't told us what...

I'll try to ID it tomorrow morning.  I picked up a Haynes Manual for the
bus, which is how I managed to notice the engine enigma after having been
out of bug/bus ownership for so long.

(Whatza &quot;PO&quot;?)

&gt; If it were my bus, I'd go back to the twin 32/34PDSITs.

I'll probably have to stick with the existing carb setup until I can afford
to replace the carb and manifold with the twins.

Thanks.
