Subject: VDO oil sender install trick

List, for those of you who have installed a VDO oil pressure gauge, along 
with its sender, I've found a way around  cutting your tinware or shelling 
out 20 bucks for a &quot;pig-tail&quot; from Bus-Boys or another FLAPS that deals in 
VDO products: While lubing the front end the other day, I happend to notice 
that the flexible extension on my grease gun looked remarkably like the afore 
mentioned 20.00 &quot;Special VDO Adaptor &quot; that I ordered along with my gauge. I 
yanked an old pressure switch out of the spare parts bin and compared the 
threads to a 12inch (double male end) flexible grease gun extension that I 
got at the local Ace Hardware for 3.95. Yup. Same EXACT threads and tubing 
(16,000psi rated) as the super-duper VDO jobbie. Go figure.
