Subject: To break or not to break

Type 2 gurus,             In reference to my '77 2litre with 12000 miles on 
complete new rebuild. (remanufactured heads, not new) (formerly &quot;#3 intake 
tightening&quot;)  I've adusted my valves now probably 6 or 7 times over the last 
12000 miles.  Most often the # 3 intake has eventually tightened down, and 
once or twice I've adjusted the #3 or #4 exhaust valve also, but it only 
needing normal adjusting (not real tight).
          My question: I want to head into the mtns. for a backpacking trip 
next weekend.  The trip will be a total of not more than 800-1000 miles 
roundtrip.  I'll be driving not more than about 65 mph.  Given the previous 
circumstances with this rebuild...do you think that if I check and adjust if 
necessary the valves each morning that I would be ok to do this trip, or to 
the contrary, that I more than likely will face valve breakage or some other 
catastrophic failure?  I will weigh all answers and make my decision to take 
my bus or not take the bus.  I noticed that the last 150 miles of driving 
did not tighten up the # 3 intake...  Not sure why it didn't tighten-maybe 
not enough miles?  Pmail me with your take on this problem and to weigh in. 
Thanks!!
                                                                 Kevin  Snow
