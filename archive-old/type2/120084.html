Subject: lugg. rack &quot;trim?&quot;

OK, thanks for all replies..
one more question on this pop-top project then I'm done!
 
73 Westy..
I know there is no seal for the luggage rack due to drainage....
but, GoWesty has a &quot;luggage rack trim&quot;
Is this OK to put on, was it &quot;stock,&quot; or is it just supposed to be plain, will it prohibit drainage...is this just for looks to match the pop-top seal?
thanks in advance for helping me finish this up!  
-Chris
