Hi all
I stripped the interior out of my bus and found the rust
to be worse than first thought, but still not that bad.
I took a wire brush and my drill and began to remove the loose 
stuff. The PO obviously had no idea what it ment to clean
so I also swept and vacumed it out.
        So I get all the loose stuff out of the way and what

I am left with are a bunch of small holes ranging from the
size of a pncil tip to the size of a quarter. Almost all the rust
is concentrated in the floor just behind the front seats. I purchased
and used some naval jelly that was supposed to eat the rust away.
IT did some but not what I expected.
        Ok so here I am, with ZERO body work experience, and even
less money to pay someone else. My desire is to prevent further 
rusting and stop what I have from spreading. This is my plan and
I would like some feedback and opinions on it. I first must
say that I am not going for a complete resto, just a good solid
family car.
1. Remove all surface rust.
2. Sand around rust to give metal texture.
3. using fiberglass tape, tape over all the rust holes.
4. use body filler to build over the tape.
5. sand and sand and sand
6. prime surface for painting
7. paint surface with rust resistant paint.

        I hope to put down some different insulation, maybe Mylar,
on th floor anf then carpet it. My thought is that maybe the floor
of my bus (Which will be hid by carpet) is the best place to 
start my experience in body work. Thoughts, ideas, suggestions?????
Thanks.........Chip
