Subject: Re: [T2] Smelling Gas on Mtn Passes -- Going Down


&gt;As an addendum to the previous post (Re: I Smell Gas Fumes on Mountain
&gt;Passes), I have noticed a similar occurrence while roadtripping in my
&gt;girlfriend's 77 FI bus.  Whenever we climb a hill or mountain (or any
&gt;significant incline, for that matter) there are no noticeable fumes present,
&gt;but when coming back down that same grade the gas smell really becomes very
&gt;strong.  It always gives me the willies and makes look to make sure that the
&gt;fire extinguisher is still mounted back in the cabin.  Can anyone pinpoint a
&gt;source of gas fumes that only rears it's ugly head when the nose of the bus
&gt;is pointing down a hill?  Thanks!

Fix it before you have a uniquely burnt bus...

Do you have raw fumes coming through the heater or through the rear door 
seal or real window seal?

Does the engine hatch above the engine leak?

I bet you've got a fuel leak that only happens on downhill curvy roads and 
this is not exhaust but gas fumes.

Fix it!

Check all of the fuel lines, the vent lines, and the filler neck. The 
repair will cost less than $50 but will save you the cost of a replacement 
bus.
