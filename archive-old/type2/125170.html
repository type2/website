Subject: RE: [T2] Another Excellent Custom Canvas Vendor

&gt; http://shop.1usa_dot_com/aabest/merchant.ihtml?id=221&amp;step=2


I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;custom&quot; canvas vendor, but the one you
linked is selling the exact same canvas that pretty much everyone else
sells (myself, Go Westy, West Coast Metric, etc.)  My prices are a
little lower, though (especially with your listmember discount).  The
standard 3-window replacement shown in their link (and the one that I
have) is a cotton material, &quot;rougher&quot; in texture than the original.  It
does not look &quot;stock&quot; but does a good job. It is available in tan, gray,
or yellow, as well as some custom colors. Their yellow is brighter than
the original yellow. Their &quot;tan&quot; is almost more of a mustard color, so
it actually looks fine as a replacement for original yellow canvas, and
is what most people buy. 

The same factory also offers replacement canvas in Sunbrella, an acrylic
fabric, at a higher cost. Sunbrella's biggest advantage is that it won't
fade after prolonged exposure to sunlight, which is why it's primarily
used for marine applications (where it is continuously exposed to
reflected sun from the water). On a VW camper I am not personally
convinced of the advantage of this, as a poptop is not likely to be kept
open all day long every day (enough for the color to noticably fade). It
does have a downside in that this material is harder to fold, making it
more difficult to close the poptop. While we do offer the acrylic
optionally, few people choose it.

In about 2 months, we will begin exclusively importing a different
replacement canvas from Europe that has more of an &quot;authentic&quot;
texture/look as opposed to the rougher textured cotton material. It is
still a 3-window canvas and will be about the same price as the
currently-available cotton canvas. I wouldn't say that it's functionally
either better or worse than the currently available cotton replacement,
but it does look more &quot;stock.&quot; This will be available only in tan. 

For those who want an actual OEM German replacement canvas, we also have
a SMALL quantity of genuine Westfalia ones as well, at a bit of a higher
price. These are the highest quality you can buy. At this time these are
only made in 3-window thru '73 and 1-window from '74 on. I believe that
we are the only U.S. supplier of genuine Westfalia replacement canvas. I
have to import them from Germany myself because there is no U.S.
distribution. They are available only in tan.

One note about color: Although yellow, orange, and green were offered on
various U.S market Westies, the original German fabric supplier
discontinued those colors years ago, so no exact match is available.
However, in Europe, tan was also available throughout the years. So even
if your original canvas is one of those other colors, your bus could
still be considered &quot;stock&quot; using a tan canvas (although not technically
&quot;U.S. spec&quot;).
