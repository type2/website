Subject: Re: [T2] shaky brakey

Michael,

I wrote the following in response to a p-mail question from another list
member, but it applies to you as well, so here it is:

I would bet that your tight wheels are as a result of clogged flex lines.
The pulling *may* also be, or it may be a leaking wheel cylinder.

My position is that brakes are vital and if there is anything suspect
about the brakes on my bus, i stop driving it 'til it is fixed.  When I
get a new bus, I tend to replace the brake system a little bit at a time
until it is all new, or at least all inspected. If you want a priority
list of things to fix on brakes, mine goes like this:

4 new flex lines (just because they are *all* suspect and not inspectable.
*new  front calipers or cylinders;
new front pads or shoes;
*new rear cylinders;
new rear shoes;
*new metal lines;
*new rotors;
*new drums.

The * items require inspection and replacement if bad.  The general rules
are that the flex lines are *always* original and toast; the front brakes
are more important than the rear brakes; and anything you do to one end of
an axle, you do to the other end as well.
