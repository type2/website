Hi,
&gt; The problem is that here in the Youess we are relatively free to put
&gt; any tires we wish on our vehicles.

 Yep, same here. I suppose technically you'd probably be in breach of road safety legislation but you'd have to kill someone to get caught.

&gt;  Most bus owners outside of the
&gt; list are really unaware of the unusual tire requirements of their VWs.

 Maybe this is the root of the problem- in the UK the Transporter is recognised as not being a car (ie basically a van).

&gt;  If you go to a garden variety tire store they will happily sell you
&gt; 185R14 passenger tires or 195/75R14 LT tires, since these are the
&gt; tires they have in stock.  They don't know (or care) that these tires are not suitable for buses.  

 Hmm, here they'd know (it's on the computer after all) and sell you the appropriate tyres because they'll make more money on a £80 van tyre than a £40 car tyre (and because it's the right thing to to). 

&gt; I habitually check out every bus I see and only one in ten or so has
&gt; correct tires installed.  Most of the rest have passenger tires.  

 I've seen quite a few here with underspec tyres but I think that's mostly from people being cheap: Jeez! How much? Don't you have anything cheaper?/Well you'd probably get away with xxxxx if you take it easy and don't carry much weight./ Yeah! that's fine! gimme those!

&gt;  No tire store
&gt; is going to devote storage space to a product that sells so slowly,
&gt; particularly if they can talk the customer into buying a faster-moving
&gt; alternative size.

 OK, but Harmon was talking about tyre dealers who didn't know what the correct fitment was and couldn't find the right tyres in their catalogues. Lots of listees have posted reports of tyre dealers not being able to find 185R14Cs to order them etc.
 THIS is what I think is ridiculous- not bus owners not being able to find tyres in stock (that's silly, but not ridiculous :-) but tyre dealers with databases of fitments and manufacturers catalogues claiming that they arn't available. Maybe this has been going on so long that the tyres arn't imported much anymore but still- There is absolutely NOTHING bizarre or weird about the tyre size that's used on a bus. Michelin, Continental, Uniroyal, Goodyear, Dunlop, Pirelli, Semperit, Viking, Firestone etc. all sell thousands of these tyres all over the world every year (probably every month).
 They are made by the big label brands, by budget brands, in all-season and in winter types and for light and heavy duty usage.

 I hesitate to make any assertions about why it's hard to get these tyres in the US- There _are_ many more US based listees than elsewhere  and you probably have a much better understanding of the way the US works than I do. But still: the problem isn't that they arn't made, or that they are in any way rare, it's entirely down to importing them to the US.
If your tyre dealer assumes that what's right for America is right for the rest of the world then he's doing no-one any favours.

 (sorry if I'm ranting...   :-(   )
Cheers,
             W.
PS &quot;It's funny: you're the third guy today that's been in asking about those tyres but we don't stock 'em- there's just no demand...&quot;
