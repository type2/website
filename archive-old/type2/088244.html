Subject: Re: [T2] Drive it really far, it just might make it

 In the summer of 94' I drove my 75 Westy from Halifax, Nova Scotia to
Vancouver, British Columbia and back without any problems. The 75 westy is
gone but the engine is now in my 79 westy and still runs great!

&gt; Chuck,
&gt;     In a recent post you said........People, take your bus out on the
road.
&gt; Drive it really far, it just might make it.&quot;.......
&gt; A couple of summers ago my wife Kathy and I used our '71 westy for a 1
week
&gt; vacation from Long Island, NY to lower MI and back again.  In those 7 days
&gt; we drove over 2000 trouble free miles.  Does that count as really far?  We
&gt; slept in our bus every night, even when we were parked in the driveway of
&gt; friends.  And not only do we use our bus for trips, we use it as a daily
&gt; driver too, day in and day out.
&gt;     Happy friday everybody.
