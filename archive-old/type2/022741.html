&gt;&gt; any other suggestions on where to mount front speakers will be
appreciated as well. &lt;&lt;

Tesa, When I installed new speakers in the PO's old holes in the front
doors, I found the vapor barrier to be unsalvageable.  It didn't look that
easy to replace it so I protected my speakers with the pre-formed baffles
from www.crutchfield_dot_com that enclose the rear of the speaker.  This will
also help the lower frequencies get to your ears, but it will not address
the problem of moisture getting to the door panels.  Anyone have a good
suggestion for gluing new plastic in there?  I'm handy, if not totally
mechanically inclined but that seems daunting.  I farmed out my upholstery
and curtains too.  =(
