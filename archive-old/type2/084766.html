&gt;Hi Bob:
&gt;
&gt;Nice (and sad) story. Did you notice that your rear bumper is from a split
&gt;window bus? It looks pretty straight in the photo. If so, it is worth about 3
&gt;good bay window bus' bumpers, at least!!
=========================&gt;
Yes, I know.
In fact, I found a complete splitty bumper with over riders in Whitehorse 
for $20.00 Canadian money.
The guy insisted he did not have anything for me, but way up on an outdoor 
shelf I could see what looked like a bus bumper protruding over the shelf 
ledge.
Bingo, I found what I wanted on further poking around up there.

Sad part is.......... I did not need the bumper, so left it behind in the 
junk yard.
I told the guy if someone came in and wanted it, please remember I paid for 
it, and they could give it away to the guy doing the asking. :-)

All I needed were the over riders, as my splitty rear bumper did not get 
bent or hammered by some miracle.

So, on Casper, I have the splitty bumper mounts, splitty bumper, and the 
splitty over riders are in a box waiting to be painted and attached as a 
last past of Casper's rehab.

The good part for someone, maybe.............. I'm willing to trade all of 
the splitty rear bumper stuff for clean proper ones to fit Casper, but I 
like the splitty rear look, so I'm not too keen on busting myself to find 
the proper bumper components for Casper. As is, I am happy with the older 
layout and look.

One thing getting smacked taught  me is that there is a lot of bus stuff 
way up North. Buses have been driven up there, broke down, and got left 
where they died.

If you travel up North, bring your want list and parts removal tools.
