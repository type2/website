Hi Volks,

&gt; Yeah, well VW has a vested interest in selling more cars. And in
&gt; keeping their dealers busy fixing old ones. VW doesn't tell you the
&gt; correct scoop on lots of stuff, like how often to adjust the valves on
&gt; solid lifter engines. Muir does. 

FWIW, the German book &quot;Jetzt helfe ich mir selbst&quot; (Now I'll Help 
Myself), actually a sort of enhanced operating manual and about as 
widely believed in here as Muir is across the pond, also suggests 
driving off immediately and going softly the first few minutes 
during warmup.  And it does make sense - engines do warm up faster 
under load, you can't deny that; and the longer you take to warm it 
up, the longer it runs cold, which is a Bad Thing.

Apart from which, ignoring VW's operating instructions is akin to 
leaving out parts of the VW cooling system in believing that you know 
better than them.  It certainly can't hurt to do some maintenance 
items more often than VW suggested, but to do *opposite* from what 
they suggested sounds like a bad idea to me.  I wouldn't believe in 
everything VW told me - but much less would I believe in everything 
some book author told me... when in doubt, VW knew better.

Yours,
    Erik.
