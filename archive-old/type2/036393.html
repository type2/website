Subject: Re: Jumped a lady.Weak urban myth

Actually it isn't an urban myth but a fact. the fact is that if you jump a 
car with your car running the alternator voltage can spike high enough to 
damage some electronic components. As far back as the early '80s this was a 
well know and common occurance. The solution is to only give a jump with your 
engine off. No alternator no voltage spike. The problem is that people have 
such short attention spans they hear part of the instructions but not all. 
It;s just like people not reading signs. 

So the moral is don't run your engine if you have an alternator.
