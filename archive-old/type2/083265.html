I'll try that again. :)

[tune up Parts for any /common/ distributor are readily available at every
FLAPS i've checked with.  That is, any t1/t2/t3/t4 since the 1500cc engine
started going in to them.  The late 40hp parts are pretty available as
well.

Oriellys, Advance, Autozone, Discount, NAPA, PepBoys, to name a few, all
carry tall AND short caps (and short wide caps too), as well as the
required variety of rotors.  And, for those that dont like Wells or
Standard parts, Bosch still makes all of these new as well and are
available from your favorite VWFLAPS.

They also have the many styles of points and condensors for these, as
well...just be sure you know what year/model your distributor SHOULD be
on, and ask for parts for that year.  (for example, my '66 distributor
uses a short cap, but the '69 unit I actually use uses a tall cap. Both
use the same points and condenser (through-the-bottom, not
through-the-side).  So I ask for parts for a '69 vw bus when I get'm, NOT
for a 66.  If I've swapped over to the 66 unit (it's in the spares box),
then I'll request 66 parts.
