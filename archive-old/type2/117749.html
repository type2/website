Subject: Re: [T2] ignition help/mechanic problems

Meg,

I have never seen a pertronix get &quot;intermitent&quot;...if it is going to 
die...it should just fail...other may have different expierinces.

Meg,  Fuel injected??  First thing I do on a &quot;new&quot; bus is go thru *every*
electrical connector and clean and wire brush and reseat.  Sounds to me
like you have something loose somewhere.

If the connectors don't fit tight, then gently squeeze them for a better 
grip or buy a kit and start replacing them.

So, the first time this happened, what fixed it??

Cheers, dave
