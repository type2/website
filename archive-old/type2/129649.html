Subject: POR-15 and TK---

One thing that I have done with the POR 15 that I have at my house was just
seal it with plastic wrap over the can, then put the lid on. I have several of
those little cans lying around the shed and one that I just opened the other
day was still fine. I am not sure if the paint was ok since it was frozen all
winter, but it was not dried up.
