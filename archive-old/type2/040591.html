Well, I'm not taking sides here, but I don't think that it's a matter of &quot;discrimination&quot; at all.
One guy has a store (or a public event) and it's HIS money that's paying for it,
Then It's HIM that decides who can and who cannot come in. PERIOD!
The reason that one guy is a jerk is sufficient not to allow him in, even if he isn't a jerk.
This is purely a golden rule thing here. It's HIS gold, and HE makes the rules.
It has nothing to do with the color of his skin or his sexual persuasion, It has to do with HIM!

I know that if I was paying for an &quot;event&quot;, that there are a couple of people that I would ban.
That's MY right. It has nothing to do with constitutional rights at all.
