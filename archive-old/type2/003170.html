Boy can I identify with that one.  The Bus I just bought, which I thought
had slight Bondo in the Nose, turned out to have about 3/4's of an inch of
filler.  The cargo doors had a crease in them and instead of working it with
a hammer they filled it in.  I plan on taking the filler out and working the
doors with a hammer and dolly.  See if I can still do Body work.  The Nose
on the 66 is getting a 60 Nose skin with Bullets.  Can't wait to finish
that, since I like the Bullet look.

&gt; You guys are rite bondo and filler are good if used rite, BUT 9 out of 10
&gt; people that use it have no idea of the way to use it. I have some pics in
&gt; file from the last 4 years of restoring VW's alone that will show you what
&gt; i'm talking about , I have a 57 and 55 both here now that were major bondo
&gt; wagons and each had fiberglass in them to, in addition to newspaper, spray
&gt; foam,wire mesh,(various sizes), window screen wire,steelwool pads, this
&gt; among other stuff i have forgotten about. On the 57 the front nose and
BOTH
&gt; rear corners were sculpted from bondo, as well as the drip rail and all
the
&gt; skylights on the drivers side. These owners will tell you bad bondo work
&gt; will cost you in the long run. I'll be posting some pics first of July on
my
&gt; pages of Kents 56, in these it will show the use of metal to metal filler
&gt; and another type of filler used to do the smoothing of the 56. i'll post a
&gt; notice when i update, later and as always this is the way i feel about
bondo
&gt; , but most of my experinces with other peoples work is bad. Sorry if this
&gt; offends anyone.
