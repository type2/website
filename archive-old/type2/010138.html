	Its not Friday but I have to wiegh-in. I was barely out 
of my teens, 21, when I bought my first bus. It drove great with the 
smog-illegal carb the seller had on it, but he swapped the legal item 
before turning it over to me, at my request. It had a broken right-rear 
window which we  replaced together the day I picked it up. I loved driving 
it. I loved driving it even after the throw-out bearing exploded three days 
after I bought it, adding $150 (1978) repair to my $1200 purchase. (No time,
no tools, no-one to help me. I was a college student living in a
rented room. It was the right decision.) 

	I changed the oil, set the valves, adjusted the fan-belt, 
rebuilt the carb,  adjusted the brakes. I painted the worst rust spot. 
I didn't set the point gap and it took only 1500 miles or so running for 
the rubbing block to wear down to naught, stranding me and my brother 
half way home from the Sierra. A friendly gas station attendant in Stockton 
found a set of points in his shop late Saturday night and put us back on 
the road. A great adventure with a happy ending. By then I'd bought and 
used chains for it and driven in the snow too.

	I had the Muir book, most of the Phase 1 tools, and the
Haynes book for good measure. I didn't have the throttle positioner/
decel widget needed to pass smog, so I never completed registration 
before the engine gave out at about 2500 miles of ownership. A complete
mort- the oil looked like settled-out silver paint from all the metal
particles, the knocking sound was #2's intake lifter rocking in its
bore- somehow the lifters were underside, wore, bent, banged up the
bores. I pulled the rockers, pulled out the pushrod and the
lifter fell out of what was left of the bore, going 'thunk' into
the oil pan. All the lifters were junk. What happened? I'll never know.

	At $100 or so a month for 12 months, financing, I still owed
$600 when it died. I kept making the payments, moved, talked to the local
shops, removed and disassembled the engine and gave up. A friendly
family paid me $660 for the pieces, which paid-off the balance of
the load and supplied some of the down-payment for a 2-year-old
Rabbbit, bought at a dealer for $4400, which took me 184,000 miles 
over more than a decade with reasonable maintenance.

	I bought the wrong bus, was in the wrong state of mind to
learn to be a mechanic, though I wanted to learn. I had no help, no
time, no money. As a teenager I certainly had the time, and possibly
even the friends to help. But no money, and no real place to work.

	By contrast my friend Bill Dopson bought a number of splitie
junkers when we were all in highschool and combined them into one 
functioning bus, with rattle-can red spraypaint, rims painted 
different colors. The body he kept was one with a rectangular hinged 
hatch in front of the side doors- some kind of camper conversion of
a van, with vent louvers at the top of each side. I'll never forget
helping pump gear oil into the reduction boxes in the middle of
winter :)

	Conclusion: Teenagers and busses DO go together. Time and 
a place to work are important. A job or other supply of money is
VITAL. Friends or family who are willing to help you learn are
VITAL. No doubt better folks than I would have succeeded where I
failed. Would have bought a different bus, fixed the motor, persevered.

	I had a terrible experience and learned a lot from it. Bringing
our single cab to life- starting engineless- seems to be the poetic end
to the story, 17 years later. Money, time, a place to work and the
help of friends made all the difference.

	If our son wants a bus when he grows up, I'll help with the place
to work, loan my tools, even supply a little money and personal help
if its wanted. I'm willing to help make a bus, or anything else he
develops a passion for, possible, if he wants to do the work. 

	Thanks for listening.
	Bill
