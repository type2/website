Subject: Re: [T2] rumor mill

Here's what I found on a website:

14.  WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MYTHS ABOUT BATTERIES?
14.1. Storing a battery on a concrete floor will discharge them.

A hundred years ago when battery cases were made of porous materials
such as wood, storing batteries on concrete floor would accelerate the
discharge.  Modern battery cases are made of polypropylene or hard
rubber.  These cases seal better, so external leakage-causing discharge
is no longer a problem, provided the top of the battery is clean.=20
Temperature stratification within large batteries could accelerate the
internal =93leakage=94 or self-discharge if the battery is sitting on a c=
old
floor in a warm room or is installed in a submarine.

&gt; Hey VeeDubbers,
&gt; I got another rumor i want to have debunked. Thanks to Jim Hood for
&gt; dispelling the last one, in which a neighbor told me &quot;a car battery set=
 on
&gt; concrete will lose its charge quickly.&quot; NOT TRUE says Jim.
&gt; The other one I had, notably from the same neighbor, is that &quot;the wire
&gt; around your pushrod tubes (retaining wire) doesn't need to be there, ju=
st
&gt; throw it away when you take off the valve covers.&quot;
&gt; Uh, i have seen a number of busses without this wire, probably because =
it is
&gt; a pain to get in right, but are folks without this wire headed towards =
some
&gt; kind of disaster?
&gt; Okay, also, if anyone else has VW oldwive's tales, lets discuss 'em...
