Subject: RE: [T2] Empi nylock engine nut kits

  Made in Taiwan, really soft nuts and the washers, well!. I have used them
and they did work, I just didn't like the feel, thats just a personal thing
to me. I also have had German nylocks that stip out at 16 ft lbs of torque.

ronnie  use what you need

Subject: [T2] Empi nylock engine nut kits


Is there any reason to NOT use the Nylock nut kits from Empi on my Type1
1600 engine case? At 6.95 for a complete new nut set, I'm very tempted to
use them. Would appreciate any reasons pro or con about using them, from
those who have.
