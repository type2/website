Hey gang,
Thought I would pass on some info from DEAD.NET reguarding Mr. Phil
Lesh as posted yesterday:

&quot;Dear Friends, 

As I write this Phil is getting ready for surgery which should take
place at approximately 3:30 PM West Coast time. I spoke to
him briefly: he sounds great and both he and Jill feel very positive. 

Please join his family and friends in a prayer/thought/wish for his
well being in the hours and days to come. &quot;



&quot;May the gods bless Phil and speed him back to good health. May there
be better days shining through. 

And I am visualizing Phil, on stage front and center, real soon,
playing … 

Blessings to you all and I will keep you informed. 

Tom &quot;
I was hoping everyone could say a prayer for him in addition to
prayers for Josh. 

For those who don't know Phil needs a new liver.  

On happier notes I will be in Phoenix for the Holidays, any listee's
want to have a beer (A BEER FOR JOSH, I AM BUYING!!) and talk busses,
a little show and tell? 

Everyone have a happy &amp; safe holiday,

Patrick Flynn
