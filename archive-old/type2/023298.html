Subject: Re: [T2] Now what?!?  69 bus tire/ brake issues

They warped your rotors by overtorquing the lug nuts.

At least this would be my first guess.

Loosen the lug nuts and re-torque - even a basic torque wrench or even a 
calibrated mechanic will work.

Hopefully this will fix it. I don't know if this will release any warping 
they might have caused.

I had this happen to a Honda I used to own - each lug nut was on about 45# 
too much.

Now I won't even let a shop tighten the lug nuts on my car (different shop) 
with an air ratchet. I request permission to torque the nuts myself when 
the wheels go back on. They think I'm crazy but instead of a 12 year old 
Honda I am driving a 2 year old Honda with 40K miles versus 140K miles and 
I am a little more picky... &lt;grin&gt;

Every - every - time I check they have missed the shop manual toque spec on 
the tight side. That includes when they use those little colored extensions 
on their air ratchets.

One fellow didn't believe me and asked to let him try with his little air 
gun. He did and still missed by 20#'s or so.

By the way I use a click type torque wrench - worth it's weight in gold to me.

I'm really curious so post any answers you might find.

&gt;I finally got the new tires on the 69 camper today 185R14 D rated.
&gt;
&gt;They say  65 pounds maximum pressure, and that is what they put in them, but
&gt;what pressures should I run?
&gt;
&gt;The tire place had a hell of a time getting them balanced due to an
&gt;adjustable adapter that was not working right, so I am not sure they are
&gt;balanced correctly. Anyway, as I drove off there was no roughness in the
&gt;ride. They seemed very smooth until I touched the brakes. When I touch the
&gt;brakes, the petal does that vibrating up and down thing like I have a warped
&gt;drum. What the?
&gt;Why would this start right after the new tires were put on? It does not make
&gt;any sense to me.
&gt;
&gt;I'm ready to set the thing on fire, and be done with it. Please help.
