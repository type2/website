&gt;&gt;One of the editors was complaining 
about his bad custmer service experiences when dealing 
with &quot;large corporations&quot;. He went on to say that he 
much preferred to deal with the small businesses that 
support the acvw hobby.&lt;&lt;

maybe this guy should look in the mirror.  i could tell
you some nightmare customer service stories about
VW Trends.

i've been boycotting that publication for some time now.

just my .02
