Subject: Another ext. oil filter question...

Stupid question #1254 (and you though no one was counting):

I recently saw a buddy's bug with an external oil filter and cooler that
was hooked up via an adapter plate bolted where the stock oil cooler
used to be.  This time I DID check the sermons before asking and
couldn't find any mention of such a thing.  Anyone using one?  Good
idea?  Bad idea?  Anyone wish I'd stop asking questions yet?

Thanks.
