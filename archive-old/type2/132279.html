I used a Victor Reinz seal from German Supply because I like the look of the
gasket set. The first half of it went in easily but the second was a real
bear and the seal was starting to look like I was going to damage it from
the blows. I used a sanded block of wood and a deadblow hammer with a new
face.

The seal was a great fit though: just the other day I poked my finger
through the hole in the case to feel the back of the flywheel and it's dry
as a bone inside. Quite a change from what I had before:
