&gt; Even if I do sell the current van, I would like to get one that I can handle

it has often been postulated that if you want an old style doghouse engine
the best year is probably a 71
want a little more power and a type 4 engine and the 78 is probably the
best year.

now condition is everything or at least a whole lot so that takes
precedence.   be sure and look at it before you plunk down your hard
earned $$$ and if your not sure drag someone who knows a little more with
you.....the old axiom is that you will spend $5,000 on a bus is probably
not too far off.  if you get a $1,000 bus be prepared to put at least
$4,000 into it,  of course there are as many exceptions as there are rules
so as always YMMV.

 depending what you want out of a bus you might draw up a list of what you
want, what you need and what you can't live without, and consider your
level of expertise and time to sink into the bus

me and rust were running neck and neck...but I think rust may be pulling
ahead......
