Subject: RE: [T2] R.I.P. 'Rocky Mountain' Motorworks

&gt; Hey Ron, is this gonna affect you and other smaller 
&gt; distributors of RMMW parts?  Hopefully not too badly, you 
&gt; guys are the ones who are the real heros, RMMW was too 
&gt; expensive anyway, but Real source is OUTRAGEOUSLY  
&gt; expensive.I hope there isn't a huge ripple effect that makes 
&gt; parts even harder to get.


I wouldn't expect a huge ripple. To quote T.S. Eliot, Rocky Mountain
Motorworks went out not with a bang, but a whimper. The Motorworks that
closed yesterday was already a small shadow of the Motorworks that
existed a few years earlier. Motorworks had been &quot;up on the auction
block&quot; for a couple of years, and in the meantime had severely
downsized, both in terms of inventory levels and number of employees. In
fact, over much of the last year, having found a buyer, they were mainly
just selling off remaining stock. Therefore any impact on Bus owners in
terms of parts availability had already occurred gradually over time
anyway. And often other vendors such as myself had already been &quot;filling
the gap&quot; by stocking many of those items.

As for any effect on Bus Depot, it will be negligable. While we bought a
lot of parts from Motorworks' wholesale division in our early days, over
time we started buying less. This is partially because we're much larger
now, and buy directly from many of the same companies that they bought
from. And partially because as Motorworks' stock dwindled, even when we
placed an order they often couldn't supply most of it. I'm sorry to see
them go, as they were good to deal with, but recently we hadn't been
dealing with them nearly as much anyway. We'll see a handful of parts
get harder to find for a while, but nothing dramatic.  

As for any long term impact on the VW community, I guess that all
depends on what Real Source does with the brand. As for parts
availability, I'm sure they plan to stock much more than Motorworks did
near the end, so that's a good thing for Bus owners (assuming that they
continue to sell Bus parts; right now Real Source mostly sells Bug
parts). In terms of pricing, neither Motorworks nor Real Source are
heavily price-driven retailers, and I wouldn't anticipate any huge
changes from that standpoint. 

It's a tough economy right now, and the spiraling U.S. dollar isn't
helping when it comes to imported parts. (Yesterday the U.S. dollar
reached all-time lows against the Euro. That, not Motorworks' sale, is
what's going to drive VW parts prices up across the board.)  Motorworks
was not the first to fall and probably won't be the last. If you look at
a VW Trends magazine from a year or two ago, most of the biggest
advertisers are no longer in business. Even the big auto parts chains
are feeling the crunch; Pep Boys, for example, closed about 40 stores
and laid off 1000 people last year. On the wholesale side, a large
import parts distributor recently went backrupt.  It's times like this
that our strictly low-overhead, no-frills approach really pays off, as
it allows us to stay &quot;lean and mean.&quot;  Without a big expensive
infrastructure to maintain, we're more qualified than the &quot;fat cats&quot; to
weather the tough times, and in fact we had our best year ever in 2003.
