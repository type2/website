Subject: Re: [T2] decorating the bus for Xmas

I might put the wreath on the front. Regarding the fake snow on the windows...
I have real one when the it gets cold here in Boston, inside and out of the 
bus....
Two nights ago I couldn't clear the frost using the windshield liquid and 
wipers until
I realized the frost was on the inside of the windshield! I better figure 
out how to
boos my heating system, otherwise a snowman would be driving that bus soon...

Happy Holidays and Happy New Year to you all

&gt;A wreath looks great on the front of a bus! -Better so than on the front of a
&gt;SUV or the like.
