&gt;Some neat goodies on it...

It's been years since I rebuilt an air cooled engine, either a 40 horse or 
the 1600 bp so this line from the ad got me wondering.

 &gt;&gt;Of course, if you want to rebuild the engine, you'll be back in business 
with the bus... dont let me discourage you from that (but i dont think it's 
a good long term strategy, but then again another ~$1000 and you've got a 
van that will run for a few years &lt;&lt;

$1000 to rebuild an engine? What does it cost to rebuild an air cooled 
engine these days?
