Subject: Pacesetter muffler

Bob, great to hear that SOME ONE ELSE has seen this flaw in the pacesetter 
muffler!!!

Now, I bought a pacesetter muffler last July.  I picked it up at Bus Depot, 
and drove it to a High Performance Coating shop in Maryland.  A week later, 
it was ready.  $79.99 from Bus Depot, $70 for the exhaust coating.

Three months later, I am under the Westy and I grab at the muffler tail pipe 
to pull myself out from under, and the tail pipe almost ripped off in my 
hand!!!

What a bozo I felt like!!..  I put my old muffler back on, and cried.  I was 
just about ready to return the muffler, but my VW mechanic suggested that it 
could be welded.  If it was not for the HP Coating, I would have returned 
it.   But I got it welded for $30.  This was $30 to repair a near new $80 + 
$70 muffler, probably the limit of economical repair.

Well, the problem with your muffler, Bob, is that the tail pipe WAS NOT tack 
welded to the exhaust pipe which it is adjacent to!!!  Just like mine.

I my present 4 year old muffler IS welded right where the exhaust pipe 
touches the tail pipe, giving the tail pipe some support, so I am keeping it 
on.

So, be warned, you of little faith.  If you have a RECENT paceseter (I don't 
even capitalize that name anymore), and those two pipes on the right side of 
the muffler are NOT weleded together, be prepared for the tail pipe to come 
off in you hand, and DEFINATELY if you back into something, like a snow pile 
this winter, or a high curb stone.

Alternative to pacesetter??  S &amp; S muffler has a comparable product to 
pacesetter.

I called  S &amp; S and ordered their muffler because I saw another S &amp; S 
muffler in a VW store, and it was a good piece of pipe  It has been hanging 
in this store for over 4 years, probably much more.  The price is about 
$167.  It is quality between the thin pacesetters of today, and the ANSA 
mufflers of yester-year.

But I bought the S &amp; S from S &amp; S. Got a 10% discount, too! Now I can look 
at my silver (aluminum coated) pacesetter, and my brand new S &amp; S (never 
been put on!!) and compare quality.  [[But let me tell you.  The best 
muffler I've experienced was my original J C Whitney muffler, (also a 
paceseter) which was an old, heavy, solid type that only lost the battle 
after I backed into a high curb. This muffler would have won the comparrison 
battel hands down.  Even over Midas, which I also have in my garage!!]]

S &amp; S said that they get their muffler bodies from the same place that 
pacesetter does, and S &amp; S just puts on their own pipes and flanges.

Still, the S &amp; S muffler does not have the tail pipe welded to the exhaust 
pipe, and in fact, they are not even close...

One more rant and I will go home:  I am STILL running the muffler I  got 
(paid for) from a local listee some 4+ years ago.  It came from some outfit 
in Tampa Florida, but I did not catch their name.  $70, and another light 
weight muffler, but it is 'tack' welded, tail pipe to exhaust pipe.  But it 
is about half the weight of the J C Whitney muffler I broke.

Anybody want to come up with the name of the main VW store in Tampa?? 
Perhaps stop by, and check the muffler, see if it still has the suport 
weld???  It could be just a point better than pacesetter, if it does

Barry sends  '78 Westy, with more mufflers than motors.

&lt;&lt; Quote below &gt;&gt;

&quot;&quot;&quot;about 2 weeks ago I put a pacesetter muffler on my 78 2l (got it from Ron 
at Bus Depot but this is not about his service which was fine).

&quot;&quot;&quot;today I had to get some welding done on another part of the exhaust
system, and while under there grabbed the tailpipe (not very hard) and it 
broke off!!  it wasn't the weld either but the metal of the end of the 
muffler just cracked!

&quot;&quot;&quot;Hey Ron is there anything better actually avaliable?????

&quot;&quot;&quot;Bob
