Hi Jonathan,

I assume you didn't have time at the weekend (with putting in carpets and 
stereo) to play with anything at the back end of your bus. Also I assume the 
fuse didn't blow before the weekend.

What you have done is installed your stereo and run wires around under the dash.

If I were you I would take a look under the dash to see if any wires have come 
out of the connector block between the indicator stalk and the main wiring loom.
Also have a look at the connector blocks where the right and left indicator 
wires split in two (one for back and one for front).

With age the connections in these connector blocks become tired, slip apart 
when jiggled, and cause strange happenings - short circuits, head lights not to 
dip etc, etc...

Bob
