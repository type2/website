Subject: Re: [T2] California/ federal vanagon hybrid??

You have a basket case. It may have started life as a Calif version but it is not now. If you have points, you
no longer have a Cal version..
Do you have a single or dual vacuum unit on the distributor?
Single means it times at 7.5 before.

If it had a dual unit [Cal electronic] then it would time at 5 after AT IDLE with vacuum CONNECTED AND
WORKING. You CANNOT static time a dual vacuum unit dist to 5 after. You would need to subtract the vacuum
retard and time it at 7.5 before.

I cannot believe the guy you went to calls himself a mechanic when he does this:  &quot;(5ATDC, statically timed,
is also
where the mechanic appeared to have left it before I swapped the rings;
I had no need to loosen the distributor for that)&quot;.
This yahoo does not understand basic timing and vacuum advance.
Are you sure the sign over his shop does not say &quot;2 weeks ago I could not even spell Mekanic and now I are
one&quot;.

NOx is controlled a lttle by EGR, but Cal versions do not have EGR, They have O2 sensor and cat. You need to
replace your catalytic converter.

I am a little puzzled when you say the EGR fittings are capped. &quot; but the filter itself is not there and the
connection points have plates sealing them...)&quot;
You should not have any! Maybe someone put a Fed engine in it?
Does your exhaust look like this Cal pic?:
