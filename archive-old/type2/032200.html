i'll be an engineer sometime soon (see the signature).  im kinda surprised
that more people on the list arent engineers.  my dad got me interested in
VW's, and he has a masters in civil engineering (although we are farmers
in north-central illinois).  

i always thought the VW was a good engineers car because they are simple,
basic transportation.  the whole point (in my opinion) in engineering is
to make a product as simple and easy as possible while still performing
a given task well.  what other kind of car could you have and be able to
drop the engine in less than half an hour?  or buy an overhaul gasket set
for $5?  and given the fact that most of our vans (bay-windows, in this
case) were designed and built 30 years ago and still provide easy,
reliable transportation says something about the VW engineers.  they
werent perfect, but they did know their stuff.  its possible that in 30
years, the same could be said about a toyota camry, but i doubt it.  not
enough character.  VW made a business out of making odd (by American
standards) cars, and doing it well.
