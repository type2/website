Certainly this is a solution but is it economically sane?  Probably
not, even though anyone would gladly take the rarer square port heads
as cores and sell you rebuilt round ($350 a set Stephens), now you
got to scrap all the exhaust even if some of it is OK and hope to
sell it used to someone, so 2 new heater boxes anohter $350 or so
and a 1 piece exhaust at $100 or all the factory stuff for easily
another $350, all in all a big outpouring and you don't have a cat
if you need one.

BUT California Import Parts lists the '79 boxes for $220 EACH, oof
but available, as well as the rest of the cat system.  So if you get
a great deal on a '79 by all means go for it, but I'd buy and powdercoat
or jet-hot coat a nex exhaust system now while you can.

BTW I'd take a '77 in a heartbeat as well, hydraulic lifters will run
you only $100 the set, pushrods anothe $40-$50, and will drop in on
the car in a couple of hours, or you can just keep doing adjustments.
For that matter '76 or '75 OK as well, the f.i. really didn't get any
better, as long as its 2.0 they are about the same, the early ones
have the different floor layout of course but all are still the ultimate
in air cooled Westy IMHO.
