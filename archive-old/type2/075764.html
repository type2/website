Subject: Re: [T2] Upright in a late bay. How about the flipside?

Hiya Jamie,

If you go with the cooling shroud from Oregon Performance be prepared to shell out some bucks.  More than $500.  

However, the product is first rate quality.  Jake wouldn't be associated with anything else.  And I happen to know Joe L. the owner of Oregon Performance.  A stand-up guy who knows his VWs.

Mike
