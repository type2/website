Subject: Re: [T2] horsepower question


Jeremy,

Sounds like the vac advance is not doing it's thing properly.  Or the
accelerator pump/s are not actually getting any gas thru them.

Had the same thing happen on a 65 double cab in NYC in 1969.  Accelerater
pump tube got stopped up with 1 grain of sand about 6 blocks inside nyc.
It would start and idle perfectly and sound like revving up well, but
could hardly pull itself along a flat street.

Just my guess...

Cheers, dave

&gt; Ok experts, here's your puzzle:
&gt; A 1973 day camper (no poptop) with recently (professionally) tuned dual 
&gt; carbs, vac advance dizz, 1800cc motor and timed to 7.5 ATDC (like the shop 
&gt; manual says). Runs great, idles fine, revs excellent in the driveway, no 
&gt; wierd sounds or anything. Clutch is good, adjusted well. Bus sat from 1992 
&gt; to 2000, but brakes are loose now and seems to roll without much resistance. 
&gt; It won't go normally. It limps along. Tops out at about 35mph and barely has 
&gt; the oomph to start out from a stop. on a SLIGHT hill, it will not go 
&gt; forward. Am i looking at a tranny issue? Is there any other possibility?
&gt; Help!!
