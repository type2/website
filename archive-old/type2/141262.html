Subject: New engine, no fire

Hello

I was helping a friend to install his new engine a 1600 SP after the engine 
start I found the cylinders #1 &amp; #2 where not working, I did verify the 
timing, the dwell angle, firing order and the valvles, I also replaced the 
wires and spark plugs and dizzy cap, the spark in every cylinder is strong 
but the engine only fire in the left side (cylinders 3&amp;4).
I do not know what I missed but any help will be appreciate.

Thanks


Roberto
