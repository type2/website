X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Marcus,
  Try calling:
206-938-3868
This is Bry's VW/Audi yard in Seattle.
They have a barn full of windows.
If you cant get a coherent reply via fone. Let
me know. I will be going over there after Christmas...
maybe before... anyway! I have a 74 also and will
poke around some for you and get a price etc etc.
--------------------
Hello All, I'm planning on putting slider windows in 74 
bus.  Does anyone 
know of a source to obtain these?   Marcus
------------------

 With regard to the starting on hills thing.... here in
Seattle it is pretty hilly. Most people leave room tween
their front bumper and yours here. If they dont than I have
to assume they are being kind and offering a place for me
to rest against while I wait for the light to change.

My dog is usually pleased with what I do, 
because he is not infected with the concept of what I &quot;should&quot; be doing.
