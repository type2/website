&gt;Rotors can be hard to find and $$$$$ in good shape; calipers are fun, but

I bought new German rotors through Mofoco (Wisconsin) for my '71 last year
for $36 each.  Rebuilt ATE calipers (rebuilt by King calipers) go for $58
from Autopalace (a cheap FLAPS) and include 2 new pins and pad retainer.
Don't let the RMMW catalog or dealer prices mislead you--for these parts you
can spend less and not sacrifice quality or reliability.

Some of the more pricey replacement items on a '71 (for which there seem to
be no cheap rebuilt/new alternatives) are a new power booster ($220) and
rebuilt steering box ($300-$400).  Most other items can be had rebuilt or
new at a reasonable cost.  

Strictly out of curiousity, has anyone purchased a NEW front axle beam for a
bus?  I've seen the 68-79 bus beam for _at_$400 in the RMM catalog.  Can anyone
comment on the fit/finish of these?
