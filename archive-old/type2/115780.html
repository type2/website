&gt; Hey Listees, does anyone know if the &quot;skin&quot; or &quot;face&quot; of the dashboard is
&gt; replaceable on a bay?  If so, how difficult?  Mine has a big gash between
&gt; the radio hole and the glove box hole.  I've tried to figure out how to
&gt; repair it but was wondering if the entire black skin could be
&gt; replaced.  TIA,  gt

I believe the skin is glued to a dense foam which is glued to the metal. If
you managde to carefully remove the skin I don't think it will go back
smoothly. I'd try to get another dash in good condition for a low price or
go creative if the stock look wasn't an issue.
