&gt;&gt;Sorry for the waste of bandwidth but can some kind soul please direct
&gt;&gt;me to a website that allows me to date my bus? &gt;&gt;

&gt;Sounds kinda sick to me.  I like my bus, like her a lot, be we don't date,
&gt;were just good friends.

What 'll be next?? A bus that swings?

(sorry listmasterr, could not resist the temptation)
