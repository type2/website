&lt;sure that I maintain airflow and drainage.  I've seen the bulley-hewitt
bus project, but I also saw the pictures of what happened to that bus so I
will sacrifice the soundproofing for having the bus last.&gt;

Could you provide further details? We THINK we saw it on the Samba but are not sure. I am going to look around and see if I saved any pics. If it was the same one it was in really bad shape from rust.
