&gt; Wire it into your electric fuel pump, stock or
&gt; aftermarket(remember, 75-79 have FI pumps and no shut off).

Wrong about 75-79 FI pumps......
The fuel pump will run only if you are cranking the engine OR the engine is
running and the flap in the AFM is moved by air passing across it.
If the engine dies or stalls, the air movement thru the ARM stops, the flap
moves back to its rest position, the contacts open, the double relay opens,
and the pump stops.
