&gt; Hey Dan   1   no you dont have to pull the motor to install a helicoil or 
&gt; timesert   If you do rethread just flush the case with kerosene or such  also

&gt; unless a dire starit situation , hell a wooden plug would work almost as well.

Mark / Volks,

When you say flush the case with kerosene do you mean put kerosene in the
oil filler tube and let it run through the engine and out the drain hole?
This is all really new to me, so assume i know NOTHING :)

If I use a helicoil wouldn't the case have been rethreaded so another
helicoil should drop right in?  Any change a timesert would?
