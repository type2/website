Subject: 76 Bus FS

Hey all,

76 Bus for sale, south side of Atlanta.

Good body, a couple bad places but not too bad.  Runs pretty good, though
the actual mileage is unknown.  2 liter two barrel carb, both seats, air
conditioning that doesn't work but has all the parts, 4 speed.

It's just sitting, and I won't have time or money to work on it for quite a
while, so someone should take it that can put it to good use.  $800 seems
reasonable.

Pmail me if you are interested, I have a couple pictures I can send out, and
I'll try to get some digital pictures soon.  I can send you a long and
tediously accurate description.

Mike Clark
Stockbridge, GA
