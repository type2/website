 Who knows for sure, but maybe next
&gt; time our busses wont start or break down at an
&gt; inopportune time, there are helping us out instead of
&gt; being a PITA.   Just a idea to think about the next
&gt; time your lovely bus doesn't go:)   It just might save
&gt; your life.   sorry for the rambling.

Sorry, I still just think mine's a PITA ;-)
have a good Friday.
Dave
