Steve,
The more experienced will no doubt reply, but here's my .02 - gathered mostly
from this list and my own experience over the past three years and one type4
rebuild. I will never cut corners again on a rebuild.

The shop is the best source for what to and not to do to it. Ask them if
they'd hop in it and drive the trip you're talking about. If they say yes,
then ask if they'll pick up the repair tab if  the engine breaks down on the
way. VW would.

The main question is how thorough was the rebuild?
If everything but the case is new then - no, you can't hop in it and drive to
cali unless the shop will OK and guarantee it.
Other questions - are the fuel and electrical systems also 'rebuilt'? If not,
then have them at least checked. Replace all old rubber and have some fuel
filters on hand.
Did you/they replace all of the rubber in the brake booster line?  If not,
then she may run with a vac leak on that line, which will run it a little lean
and hotter than it should. If you have good power assisted brakes, then you're
probably fine, but that is a big line (1/2&quot; ID) and it runs a heavy vac - I’d
rule it out as a leak source if I could. Clamp all the connections and check
all of the other rubber in and around the engine.

I would break it in like this (if the repair shop hasn't done it already):

Start the engine, bring the rpm up between 1500 and 2G and hold it there until
the thermostat opens, then hold it another few minutes. Watch for oil leaks
while it is running. Try to ballpark the source and let the shop know if you
find any.

Shut it down, let it cool and change the oil and filter.  
Study the 'oil plate' for signs of metal shavings.  With all of the new parts,
you may see some - don't be alarmed unless you see alot or unless the shavings
are big - like pieces of fingernail...that would be a bad sign.  Even if you
did find some big ones, it may have been a 'one time cut' of something against
something and may not be cause to go back to the shop - unless they say it
is.
You may see some tiny bits of cloth or rag - this is because the builder used
cotton shop rags during the build. Hopefully (and most likely not) it won't
clog an oil passage or the cooler. Again - don't be alarmed unless this is
excessive. I have heard to use paper towels during building to prevent this.
The engine will eat paper, but not cotton.

Check the valves at this point - if they're all still at .006, then -

Start it up again and bring it back up to 1500-2G and hold it till the t-stat
opens. After it opens, hold it a little longer than you did the first time,
then shut it down and repeat the oilchange/inspection procedure.
If you don't see any 'chunks' (shavings) in the oil, then you're ready  for
the maiden voyage.

Be nice to it - accelerate moderately and don't see much over 50mph for the
first 2-300 miles, at which point you'll be doing another
oil&amp;filterchange/valve check. Listen for funky noises and report anything
alarming to the shop.

Some recommend that during he first few minutes of driving (or at some point
during the first few hundred miles) you accelerate (moderatley) up to a
certain RPM (maybe 2G?) in first or second gear and then let off the pedal and
allow the engine to brake the vehicle back down to idle speed.  Repeat this
procedure several times. The idea is to get the rings to seat against both
sides of the piston lands.
After the first 300 miles of moderate driving, you're ready for the first
3000-mile oil run.

The new engine may run a little hotter than an older one. This is to be
expected as everything gets use to itself and (some don't like this phrase)
'machines in'.
Treat it like a normal VW engine - if it starts to run hot, back off, coast
down a hill or pull over and let it cool off.  It shouldn't continue to run
hot unless something is wrong.

I personally wouldn't take it cross country till after the first 3000 mile
oilchange, but opinions differ - as do scheduled vacation times.

I hope that more experienced/scientific/meticulous minds will counter any poor
or add to any incomplete info here, as I am a neophyte(sp?) myself.

good luck and congrats!

I have been equally as long curious to
know what I can expect out of a rebuilt engine. I will, of course, talk with
the repair shop and try to get an idea of what I can expect out of her, but
I am curious to hear from those who have had an engine rebuilt. is a rebuilt
engine basically as good as a new one, minus the luster?
Is there any proper way to &quot;break in&quot; a rebuilt engine? Is there anything I
should be on the lookout for in the first weeks of driving it? is it
reasonable to expect some sort of mileage guarantee out of a rebuilt engine?
And, lastly, can I drive it from NY to California without worrying about
anything more than an oil change? =p



Thanks!
