Subject: Re: [T2] I think it's seized

Yes, if the engine is seized, you can still use the heads as long as they weren't badly overheated in the process. You can use alot of the other parts as well if they were not harmed... Assuming the crank and 1 rod seized, you can possibly clean that same rod and crank up and have the crank polished or turned. The rod MIGHT be okay too. I had a Corvair engine that was seized but was fine after broken free. 

If the parts that seized are discolored (blue) then you might be faced with tossing them. Ask a machinist. 

Assuming that rod and the crank seized you can prob still use the block, other 3 rods, heads, cylinders, pistons, etc. etc. etc. 

I fthe crank seized to the bearing in the block it might have spun the bearing which leads to line boring the engine. A company that specializes in VW caes could answer whether you could save the case. Yes I suspect if you want tos pend the cash. I have seen light seizes where the crank needed polishing and the bearing was toast but replace the bearing and reassemble and drive many more miles. 

I haven't followed this thread very carefully but have you torn it down? 

Chris
