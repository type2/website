Subject: Re: propane conv.

I too am interested in this. I think our British Bus
Brothers might have some practical experience with LPG
Busses. Anyone? IMPCO makes an air-heated
regulator/converter for small engines. I'm not sure if
it would be large enough for a Bus. There used to be
money out there for alt-fuel conversions but it's
mostly dried-up except for new vehicle purchases.
Everything's going toward fuel cells now. Fleets are
still doing alt-fuel stuff and there's still a little
conversion work going on but the EPA's &quot;memeo 1-a&quot;
pretty well stopped most of it. It seems that a lot of
conversions were actually running dirtier that
gasoline, mainly due to cheap conversion kits and
sloppy workmanship on the installation.
