Subject: Leaky Auto Transmissions

Hi Volks,

I've had opportunity to get underneath several Auto-tranny bays and all 
of them that I've seen suffer from leaky trannies. My wife's new 77 
Sunroof is no different. In the last 4 days since I washed the driveway 
down it has dropped about a tablespoon of fluid, and I'm not even 
driving it yet!

At least one of the Auto-Bay owners I know replaces the gasket every 
spring, but it still leaks by mid-summer. Is this a design flaw in the 
tranny or a problem with the gasket?  I'm told the gasket is just 
paper, but I haven't seen one in person.

I work in the printing industry, and have access to a rubber blanket 
material that would make an excellent gasket for this application. If 
the problem is the paper gasket, then I would be glad to test-run a 
rubber gasket in it's place.

If anyone's got any input on this I'd be glad to hear it. I've looked 
in the library but I found zilch on automatic transmissions.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
