Just make sure your on the engine side of the mount so you don't stress the
pipe.  Show us pics!

Subject: [T2] progressive carb/filter pump


Does anyone have any thoughts on hard piping an external oil filter?
I'm considering using copper tubing and brass fittings to run oil from
a CB Performance oil pump to the full flow filter. I can't think of any
problem this might cause but I've never seen it done before.
I would use 5/8&quot; tubing and the filter would be mounted to the
engine mount so that vibration should not be a problem.

 Also, I'm running a Webber prog. on an EMPI manifold.
The problem is that the linkage is a little higher than that
of the original solex linkage, and creates cable length and interference
problems. I've seen manifolds with a built in linkage, and I would
like to make one like this (maybe I could mount it on the front stabilizer
bar). Has anyone seen a setup like this? Got any pics?

Thanks, Jak
