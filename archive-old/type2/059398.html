&gt; Just keep your foot flat on the floor 'til it stops accelerating, then change

...it's hard to detect sarcasm in netscape... do you seriously drive
like that? I usually shift around 3000 RPM, which is barley moving in
1st, 25 in second, 40 in 3rd, and i still barely get 15mpg...

I have a 78, BTW
