  I don't believe I've read too many posts about the
joy of having your bus up and running.  It took me
about three years to get my bus towed out of a
pasture, have the engine rebuilt, put new tires on it
and actually use it.  

  It is great to have it fully packed and sitting in
the driveway ready to go at a moment's notice, knowing
that there's better than a 50/50 chance that it'll get
us there and back.

  It is worth it.  These buses are high maintenance,
but they are the greatest camping vehicle ever
designed.
