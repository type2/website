&gt;Does someone have a link to an article that explains how they fail in

&gt;but I sure can't find it now.

The thermostats you're referring to are based on wax pellets, which 
expand when they melt. That makes the thermostat lengthen, opening the 
flaps. They fail when they don't seal anymore, so the expanding wax 
doesn't push the thermostat open (fails closed).

The traditional thermostat works a bit differently, it's natural state 
is expanded. At cold temperature, a vacuum is present. At warm 
temperature, some liquid (alcohol?) inside vaporizes, reducing the 
vacuum. The normal failure is that they develop a leak, and the bellows 
expands (fails open).

I suspect VW just found that wax pellet ones could be made much 
cheaper, since it's the same technology used by virtually every water 
cooled engine thermostat.
