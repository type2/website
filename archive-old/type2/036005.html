Subject: Christmas lights under da bus

I suppose a post this goofy should be reserved for Friday. But it is so 
type2 specific that I cannot resist. 

Under the floor of a bus, in the middle, where there is nothing (a/c and 
eberspacher folks are out of luck) is a great place to permanently put a 
zig-zagging string of Christmas lights. Plug them into an inverter when 
you're working under the bus, and under-the-bus becomes an enchanted land 
unto itself. (It already is, but now you can see!)

Plus, when some smug young day-trader in a BMW passes you briskly on the 
right, you can think: &quot;I've got something that you haven't got.&quot; In a 
sing-songy voice.

And imagine what your bus would look like to mere humans with that soft 
glow coming from beneath!

Maybe this is a bad idea for those among us who don't live where the sun 
shines every day.

Mark
