That's magic smoke, and is contained in all solid state devices.  And if it

&gt;          Ah, they were probably just smokin' Jah herb, and only thought
that
&gt; it was running. Or maybe it was demonic spirits trying to drive them

&gt; Have you ever studied the smoke theory of electricity -- goes something
about
&gt; the electrons flow thru the pipe (wire) and intermittently there are holes
&gt; filled with smoke, etc. Or maybe it's that the smoke is flowing thru the
pipe
&gt; (wire) and intermittently there are electron paritcles floating along with
it
&gt; in holes in the smoke and --- whatever, something like that, I can't
remember
&gt; at the moment
