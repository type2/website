Hiya Peter,

Sounds like you're doing a lot of the same things I've done with my Bus.

For instance, the tires.  Bought mine at Schwab about two months ago.  I got 
Jupiter 185 x 14s.  Your price of $270 sounds about right.  I bought five and 
the total came to $330 plus change.  Be aware of the load ranges for each 
tire you are considering.  It is the critical factor in choosing a tire for a 
Type 2.  Definitely go with Load Range C at the very least.  This tire is 
also available in Load Range D.  My Bus (a transporter, not a camper) was 
fitted out with Load Range C tires.  I have been very happy with these &quot;new 
shoes&quot;.

Of the shops you have listed, most are actually salvage yards which do VW 
repair work on the side.  I have done business with all of them except 
Trafton &amp; Maier.  And you should know that there are some very good 
independent mechanics out there.  However, if you want a quality job you'll 
go to Heckmann &amp; Thiemann over on Powell.  Chances are you will get charged a 
little more but you are going to get a quality job.  Depend on it.  Most of 
their mechanics are old-line, factory trained, dealership people from the 
air-cooled days.  They have forgotten more than most of us will ever know 
about VWs.  What's more, a couple of the guys are German natives with their 
training in Wolfsburg.  If I had a serious situation with any of my VWs, 
that's where I'd go.  Heck, these guys still work on Auto-Sticks.  How many 
VW places will do that?  

Best of luck,

Mike
