Subject: Voltage regulator

List,
In my eagerness to get my newly installed engine ('72
Westy) running, I neglected to hook up the voltage
regulator.  I have driven it for roughly 10-15 miles. 
I haven't driven as I am trying to find the cause for
the &quot;GEN&quot; light staying after ignition.  My question,
Could I have done any major damage to the alternator
(or anything else) while running the engine w/out the
regulator in line?

Before returning to work (on my bicycle)I hooked up
the regulator and started the engine and the light was
still on.  I didn't have the time to fully study the
situation, but I did notice that there are some leads
that aren't hooked up yet.  I will investigate further
this afternoon.  

Any advice and/or comments, as always, are very
appreciated.
