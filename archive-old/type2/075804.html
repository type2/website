Subject: Re: [T2] '76 FI engine?

Please remember that just because they are hydraulic lifters and that the
rockers do not move does not mean that all is well..   most of these vans
have excessive preload on the lifters and the stuff is flat worn
out...........this is shown in the Bug Me video that is done at Jake Raby's
when he shows the hydraulic camshaft.........all that preloading puts a lot
of strain on the contact surfaces.

&gt; &gt;You should be able to tell quickly by popping a valve cover, and looking
at
&gt; &gt;the pushrods.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hydraulic pushrods are more or less pencil thick, where as the older
solid
&gt; &gt;type are about 3/8 thick not to mention that both are made of different
&gt; &gt;material..........
&gt;
&gt; Actually hydraulic lifter (steel) pushrods are closer to 3/8 sort of like
&gt; a big thick grade school pencil and solid lifter (aluminum) pushrods
&gt; are closer to 1/2&quot;.  The solid lifter rods have steel ends pushed into
&gt; aluminum tube and this is one of the best easiest way to tell them
&gt; at a glance, if right behind the end at the rocker the pushrod gets
&gt; bigger and changes color to a grey/whitish aluminum rod, the valvetrain
&gt; is solid lifter.  As to how often to adjust, certainly every 5000 with
every
&gt; oil change is wise but in point of fact was the VW factory rec every
&gt; 15,000 for the type4?  Anyway do it more often, learn to adjust your
&gt; valves if you can't.  I think Steve's point is real good as well, just
wiggle
&gt; a rocker that is at TDC, hopefully all and certainly most on a solid
&gt; lifter will have a gap and little click, on hydraulic hopefully all but
&gt; at least 1/2 if you are lucky will still be holding oil and have no gap.
