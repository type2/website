&gt; The way I heard it was this:  In California, you can put a later model

&gt; later year in the US.  For example, you could put a '79 bus engine into a
&gt; '72 bus, and after some paperwork the smog stations would smog the '72 bus
&gt; as a '79 for smog purposes.  This means that from that point on, you would
&gt; be *required* to have all of the '79 bits, such as fuel injection,
&gt; catalytic converter, etc. in order for the '72 to pass the California Smog
&gt; Check.  What you could NOT do is put in a '76 type I engine from a European
&gt; type II, because that model was never sold in the United States.  You
&gt; cannot put in an engine from an older model year.  I often wonder how
&gt; strict they are with that &quot;same model&quot; requirement - would it be legal to
&gt; put a '93 Eurovan engine in a '72 bus (assuming it could be done)?  I don't
&gt; know the answer to that one.

What an odd law. I wonder what they do with all the street rodders who 
drop 90s engines into their 30s model cars. I suppose that explains why 
they'd have to retrofit them with converters.
