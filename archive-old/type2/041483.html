Subject: vw newbie...

howdy.
    i just got my first vw, a 73' transporter with a straight no-rust
unpainted body, no interior and what is turning out to be a very nice
engine.... all for a cool thousand... new brakes and tires too!  im gonna
redo the interior with this custom widdened westy rear seat someones selling
me... full queen size bed!
    it has been sitting for 3 years... so i went to get parts to tune it
up.... and suprise! the air filter and intake manifold gaskets wouldn't fit
cause it apparently has weber carbs on it and some aftermarket intake
manifold.... theres no telling what else cause the engine sounds like its
been hotrodded(idles like a big block..)and my buddy who's into vw buggy's
was drooling over it... it does 70 on the highway easy(75-80 max)... and
sounds like a race car accelerating... what fun! BUT........

               I GOTTA BUNCHA QUESTIONS.... THANKS FOR ANY ANSWERS YOU
HAVE!!!!!

    1.  is this tough on the engine to have it modified like that? what
about gas milage?
    2.  where can i find or make gaskets for where the pipes to the carb
attach to the intake manifold..?.(not the boots...got those..)
    3.  how much and what kind of oil do i put on this aftermarket guaze air
filter?
    4.  how do i get the cover off the engine to adjust the valves? (took
off all the inside screws and it seems to still be attached by screws and
some part on the other side of the firewall?  maybe its one whole part?)( or
do i even need to adjust the valves if its running so good with only a
slight tickety tick tick..)
    5.  there seems to be something wrong with the tranny... the clutch
cable has just been replaced but if you try and shift from 1-2 or 2-3 with
any resonable quickness it grinds a bit ...AND it grinds ALOT if you try to
downshift while moving... my buddy mentioned syncros going out maybe?
    6.  the throttle is REALLY touchy.... is there any way to change the
linkage and make it more smooth? ...i dont need a race car... im only using
up 1/3 of the travel in my accelerator peddle....
    7.  im going to redo the interior myself....i found a webpage explaining
in detail how to sound proof and insulate a vw van.... has anyone acheived
happy results soundproofing and isulating thier van? im interested in a
solid feeling van and improved climate in the hot texas summer.... i was
thinking of painting with a bright reflective based paint (pearly white on
top.. champange or the same orange-red on bottom) and trying to find that
window tint that is almost like a mirror on the outside... do they still
make that? can i do it myself? i dont care if its illegal.. ill take my
chances... i must have it.
    8. does anyone like the VWoA side tents distributed by vw a while ago...
canvas w/ white duffy... i found one but i want a tent that makes a
watertight boot to the van... and has a waterproof floor... would i just be
better off modifying a regular tent?


THANKS AGAIN!!!!
