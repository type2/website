Reasoning it
through, ideal resistance of earth strap = 0, resistance of ammeter = 0, so
ammeter
could read from 0-full current flow!!!!!

Your reasoning is not correct. Actually this method is very clever.

First: nothing in this world has a resistance of 0 ohms. The resistance may
be very low but zero is impossible.  So there will always be a (small)
voltage drop across the ground strap. Using a sensitive voltmeter you will
be able to measure this voltage which is directly proportional to the
current flow. In other words you can measure the current without interfering
with the circuit.

Second: Ammeters are just what I described above. A resistor (shunt)
combined with a voltmeter. Ammeters actually measure a voltage and a minute
amount of current passes thru the meter itself. The bulk of the current
passes thru the shunt. Ammeters for high currents need to have a shunt that
can handle these currents. That makes them very bulky and you would not
easily fit one under the dash.

Come to think of it. Using the ground strap method and a cheap digital
voltmeter one could probably build a device that measures voltage AND
charge/discharge current for the battery very easily. The only thing to work
out is the calibrating because it all depends on what the actual resistance
of the ground strap is. Hey this sounds like a nice winter project!
