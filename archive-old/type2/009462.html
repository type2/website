&gt; Please let me know if you have ideas. I'll check the injectors right now.

To see if the fuel pump is even turning on, you remove the filter and 
intake from the system so only the air flow meter (AFM) is there and
it's piece of the air filter housing.  Turn the ignition to run and
then carefully move the flap in the AFM.  You should hear the fuel
pump start working.

One of the main reasons that the engine starts then immidiatly dies 
is a vacuum hose off someplace.  Like the one between the block
breather and the big rubber goose neck or the break booster line
off.
