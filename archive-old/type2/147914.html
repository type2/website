Subject: Re: Question for those with dual 34 webers...

 &gt;What distributor are you running?

The stock SVDA for my 76 2l

 &gt;I'm about to put dual 34 ITCs on my otherwise stock
 &gt;1700 type 4 engine in my 72 camper.

 &gt;I just had rebuilt my dual vac-advance dist. and I'd
 &gt;like to keep it if possible.

Should be no problems. I have connected the vacuum to one carb only, as 
advised by others on the list and it seems to produce the desired amount of 
vacuum advance.

Cheers,

Martin.
