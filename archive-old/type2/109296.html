&gt; Is there a different hold down for the stock dizzy on a 69 than the 009
takes?
&gt; When I put the stock dizzy in it seems there is these little nubs that
protrude
&gt; from the bottom of the housing that prevent the dizzy from seating all the
way
&gt; in.

Grind those nubs off and &quot;you dizzy&quot; won't turn :)
Turn the rotor shaft until they seat in the drive gear
shaft. They are offset and only go in one way.
Don't forget the spring.
