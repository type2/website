Subject: Re: [T2] Poptop window and southern England trip

Timo asked:

 does anyone know where to get a poptop window for a '78 westy
(helsinki-interior)? Mine is badly cracked and I doubt that it can be
repaired. I can't seem to get one in Germany, so any help is
appreciated. I also thought of fabbing one on my own, but I thinkt it
will be hard to make it seal properly. Any suggestions?

Here in the USA, all bay Westfalia pop tops are solid. Only the 86? and up Vanagon Westfalia pop tops had a
plastic vent window on them.

Do you have any links to pictures of the Westfalia poptop windows in Europe?
