&gt; Find a COSTCO warehouse store.
&gt;
&gt; Give them $150.00 for one of their excellent vehicle shelters.
&gt;
&gt; Erect the shelter in your parking space, staking it down if you prefer.
&gt;

    DEFINITELY stake it down...

    I've had mine up for a month or so (not staked),  came out Sunday morning
after a fairly vigorous wind storm overnight to find it completely upside
down.  Kinda looked like the dead horse from &quot;Animal House&quot;.  What was
unbelievable is it was still intact with no rips or tears.  This is a very HD
shelter, as long as you anchor it down...
