Subject: Re: [T2] '76 FI died - update

&gt;Sounds like the battery died. Load test it and it will probably fail 
&gt;instantly.

Karl, it isn't the battery.  I went to the '76 with a fully charged battery 
[I put the battery charger on a 'new' Sears DieHard, and the battery charger 
indicated 'full charge'.  I was using this battery in another situation, so 
I also know it is good by experience.]

Nothing, no different response than with the original battery.  The '76 
would not even kick over. [starter will not rotate the engine, nor even 
indicate that it had a mission]

Situation: Cold weather, but '76 started immediately and warmed up for 5 
minutes, unattended;

I drove the '76 1/2 miles and then it stalled 3 times, one after the other  
[top speed 25 mph, caught in gear each of the 3 times but it would not 
continue running.  This was over about a 200 feet distance];

I coasted to a stop along side the curb, and then the '76 only briefly 
started 3 times [like just the cold start valve kicked in, only seconds each 
time.  I could not get it to keep the run going];

Finally,the '76 will not even kick over, even with a fresh battery.

If it is the starter system, why did it continue to die on the road??

If it is a fuel pressure problem, why won't the starter kick over??

If it is a low CCA powered / low voltage battery, why didn't a fresh battery 
do something??

And even with no vacuum, the starter should kick over, right??


OK, any thing else??  Like the FI system dual relay, [but why NOT kick 
over??]

TIA  Barry sends
