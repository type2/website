&gt; Type 4 describes the engine you have in your bus stock, also known as 
&gt; the
&gt; pancake engine. Also its probably a good idea to just plunge into the 
&gt; type2_dot_com website and look up westfalia and
&gt; riviera to see the differences.

brief summary:

pre-68: split window, type I engine, bus still called a type ||
68-70: bay window, type || engine (1600cc single-port (1600SP) a 1600DP 
also fits)
71: bay window, type || engine (1600cc dual-port (1600DP))
72-&gt;: bay window, type IV engine (1700cc, 1800cc, 2000cc, ???, aka 
pankake or loaf), bus still called a type ||

&gt; In addition a weekender is commonly known as a bus that doesn't have a 
&gt; pop
&gt; top, but does have a camper interior.

some people also call this a &quot;campmobile&quot;
