Subject: Re: [T2] Gauges A newbie Question

I have seen that also but it was done with &quot;mini&quot; guages.  These are 
almost impossible to find any more except in cheapie versions.  check 
flaps. the units were made by sun all you can get now is a triple set 
that has voltage, water temp, and ammeter i believe.  The oil temp gauge 
is no longer available in mini nor is the oil pressure gauge or the 
ammeter.

&gt;&gt; In the dash is a place to the right of the Speedometer that is a

&gt;&gt; in my old Mercedes of the same era.

&gt; The only thing VW put there was a clock. There was a VERY rare optional 
&gt; tach
&gt; that went there also. But it is almost as rare as hens teeth.
&gt; In order to put gauges there, you would need to spend a few days walking
&gt; around wrecking yards and looking at other cars dashes. But then you 
&gt; might
&gt; have a compatibility problem with sending units.......
