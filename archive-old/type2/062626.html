&gt; Here's a question for everyone... what kind of mileage do you get with 
&gt; your VW van? Our '65, from the day it was new, never got better than 17 
&gt; MPG (1500cc). Granted, it was driven 70mph on road trips (65mph after 
&gt; the rebuild, 'cause it wouldn't do 70 any longer)... but I'm reading 
&gt; some vans are batting down 25 to 30 mpg?
&gt; 
&gt; My '73 had dual carbs, but they were changed out when they went bad. 
&gt; When properly adjusted, the originals gave good mileage and power, but 
&gt; that faded off when they weren't balanced. When I went to a single 
&gt; Weber, the engine ran stronger, but was a bear to get started when temps 
&gt; dropped below 40.

I have twin Kadrons on my 1776 upright in a 72 bus. They are great and 
require little or no adjustment. I had balance, accelerator pump, etc 
checked last week and no adjustmnt was required. The last time they were 
adjusted was when they were installed about 6,000 miles ago. On two recent 
trips I got US 19.5 &amp; 20 mpg over hilly country (but only two 3rd gear 
hills).

The power of the vehicle, compared to the old single carb 1600 is bloody 
fantastic. 

Hope this helps.
