Subject: 34 PICT-3 Problems

Im working on a 71 westy bus for a friend, and it has a 1600cc dualport
with a 34 PICT-3 carb on it. The carb is really hard to adjust, when
adjusting the bypass screw to attain the correct idle, then engine seems
to jump from one extreme to the other (~1200rpm to ~700rpm) and when it
reaches around 900rpm the engine shakes badly. Today I noticed that
there appears to be gas around the throttle shaft, which If I remember
right is a bad sign for a carb, meaning its time to replace it. Does
anyone have some insight on this matter?

Jonathan
