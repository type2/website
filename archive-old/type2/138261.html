Subject: 74 westy for sale, Chico, CA.

Hey everyone,
       I recently purchased a 74 westy. I now need to move and do not have a 
place or the tools to work on it. I am looking for someone who would be 
willing to buy it and give it the restoration it deserves. $800, I need to sell as 
soon as possible. Its currently located in Chico, CA. If interested please 
email me at the address below and I will give you more details thanks.
