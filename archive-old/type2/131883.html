Subject: How many miles can you get on a tank of gas (fi motor)

Just trying to see if i have my 76 dialed in...................I got 90 on a
half tank, car seems to run great, but my vw fi book states i should be
getting around 28.5 mpg!  That seems like one heck of a goal with today's
gas prices.

Let me know...........
