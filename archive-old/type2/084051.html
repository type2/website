Subject: Limp Shifter

I had a drive around in that '70 bus I mentioned yesterday, and it seems
pretty cool to me.  The one thing that I thought was weird was how the
clutch engages with the pedal barely depressed.  Is that normal? 
Instinct tells me the clutch might be going out, &quot;but the guy said&quot; that
the clutch was only about 1000 miles old.

Aside from that, the shifter really flops around, and it's difficult to
tell if the thing is in gear or not...I never did manage to get it to go
into reverse because the shifter felt so sloppy.  I figure I need to get
more familiar with this vehicle, but it would be nice if the bus met me
half-way.  

Is a floppy/vague shifter normal?  If not, how could one [ahem] get a
stiffer stick?  I must say I'm used to my old '80 Saab, and my dad's '62
Chevy pickup...both of those cars had very positive shift-feel.

Thankie,
