Subject: Re: [T2] Rear door screen?

hey ray.
I dont know about the Riviera but on my 79 Westfalia I have snaps 
that the screen fits into. They are clearly visible when I open the 
door. Maybe the Riviera wasnt outfitted for the screen?


&gt;I just received a back screen-net for the rear door on my 1977 Riviera, I
&gt;now need to install snaps but looking at it I realize it's not as obvious as
&gt;I thought where they go? Do they go on the outside of the bus or the inside?
&gt;Can you close the door when on or not? Does anyone have a picture or
&gt;diagram, I hate to start drilling holes to install snaps till I'm sure where
&gt;to put them. Are they really mosquito proof, do people use them?
