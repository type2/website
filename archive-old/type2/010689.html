Anyone out there that has a RMMW catalog look at the muffler page. The one on my '71 transporter looks like part number 111 
251 051L. It's on an engine from a '70 bug and the air tube for the heater interferes with the prewarmer tube that goes to the 
manifold.

The question is this. Would the proper muffler, 211 251 051EBR, fit on this engine? What is the &quot;fresh air heater&quot; for?

thanks, Joel '71 transporter
