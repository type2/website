Subject: basic question

I want to replace a couple of body panels on my 78 westy this summer.  I
have no clue what this involves.  Is it generally cheaper to get whole
panels removed and welded back on by a body shop than it is do to other
body work?  It is something that is really not to difficult that I might
be able to attempt my self and if so does anyone know of any good
resources where I can find detailed info about body work?
Thanks all
Sean
