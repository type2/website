Subject: CA smog exemptions

A few months ago, I had to smog my 75 westy (PITA).
Had to locate a EGR filter box and everything. Anyway,
the guy at the smog place had mentioned that all cars
72 and older are now exempt from smog requirements. I
know that the year of exemption changes from time to
time, but does anyone know what methodology the state
uses to determine the year of vehicle exemption? In
other words, Can I look forward to having my 75 exempt
in the near future?
