Subject: Re: [T2] Oil out the exhaust-Troublshooting advice needed.

Hello John,

Is the engine missing at all? If so, check to see if
you have a spark plug that is fouling out. I don't
know much about these engines but my brother and I had
a similar problem with his beetle. It appeared that
oil was leaking out the exhaust from cylinder 3. It
turned out that the carburator was bad and was dumping
fuel in the cylinder. The fuel washed the oil in the
head and cylinder out the exhaust causing a black
liquid to drip from the exhaust. Needless to say, that
cylinder did not fire. That would explain why you have
good compression all the way around. Like I said
earlier, I don't know if this is your problem but that
is what happened with the beetle I worked on. Good
luck!

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; Need an educated opinion. Symptoms: one dual carbed
&gt; 1700 (T4) dual carbs.
&gt; Grey smoke when running, slight sputtering, not
&gt; quite backfiring at revs
&gt; above idle. Oil residue at the exhaust pipe.
&gt; Compression chack performed per
&gt; Muir with 115 plus on all cylinders and with 5 psi
&gt; of each other. 
&gt; 
&gt; The cause? The only thing I can even come close to
&gt; causing this is worn
&gt; valve guides or something. Am I on the right track
&gt; or what? Similar
&gt; experiences? Any advice welcome. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; TIA,
&gt;
