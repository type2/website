&gt;Steve,

&gt;Thanks for the info on the AFM Wheel direction.
&gt;
&gt;I confirmed that turning the wheel clockwise tightens the spring, which
&gt;would reduce the volume of air.  So when you go to sea level, the air is
&gt;denser and so you would want less volume to achieve the same mix, right?

Its not the air that you want to increase (if you could?) its the fuel
mixture to make up for the increase in density of the air.  You want to
turnit counter-clockwise (looser) to increase fuel mixture (richer).

&gt;I plan to install an O2 sensor in my exhaust so I can measure it myself.

You can borrow mine if you like.  I also have a spare 18 mm socket you can
weld on if you can find a place on your hybrid exhaust.

I don't recommend this change for just a trip to the coast but as you say
if your going to be there for a while it might make sense.  The adjust ment
should be made at the altitude you think your going to be at for awhile.
An 02 senssor or C O sniffer should be used to calibrate this correctly.
If you use a O 2 sensor, I'd try for around a 600-750 mvdc reading as some
of the information I've seen lately suggests  the VW run better a little
rich and not at &quot;Stoich&quot;(450 mvdc).

Have fun
