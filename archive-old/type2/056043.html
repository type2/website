Subject: Re: Is anyone collecting the digest posts?

Hi Steve &amp; all

I have the type2 digest from number 1 to 136 (of 1998), and then again from
402 onwards. If someone has 137 to 401, and the bandwidth, please email them
to me.

Also, I need the vintagebus digests from 1 to 67, if possible.

Thanks

Wouter
