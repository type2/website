Subject: Clutch Cable Help

I jumped in my bus this morning, pushed the clutch, something popped and
the clutch pedal dropped to the floor.  Great start to my day.  I look
under the bus ( it's a 65) and the cable has separated from the pedal
assembly.  I slacked the cable nad reattached it only to have it pop off
again.

Here's what I see:

             |___________________|
cable			connecting piece

Okay, if this &quot;illustration&quot; gets through the mail correctly, you can see
what's going on.  What I need to know is if the end is broken off, or is
something wrong with the pedal assembly?  If that piece is bad, where do I
get a new one or a new cable?  Do I have to order one?

Anyway, I'm going out to fiddle with it some more.  I'll check back soon.
Hope to have it back on the road for Sevierville this weekend.
Grace &amp; Peace,
Lucas
