Subject: Grinding the Crank
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.5.32.19991019191722.007a6880_at_rockisland_dot_com&gt;

&gt;I'm the one building a 1.8L to a 2.0L. Do you know of a 2.0L crank and rod
set or &gt;do you think I should have my crank offset ground?

I would't let anyone grind my crank unless she was not too hard to look at,
sincere, loyal, intellegent, faithfull, kind, tolerant, and thought I was
Gods gift to her. This explains why I am not married.

But all seriousness aside, crank grinding is an art, unless it's a Pinto
crank.
When you grind a type IV German crank, you remove the spezial very thin
hardening and
if it isn't replaced via a relatively spendy, spezialty process, it's risky.
Only an artful master machinist/metalurgist can be expected to do a job as
good as or better than a GOOD USED CRANK. But that's just my opinion and I
could be wrong. I do know that the quality of the type IV motor parts is
way better than the type I. You can whip up a decent type I with a file, but
why bother when a new one costs less than one rod for a type IV.

&gt;I would still need some rods, and new p&amp;c set. I live in Mount Vernon so
you're not &gt;to far from me. I was wondering what type of shop you have out
there, maybe &gt;sometime I could come by to see it.

Sometime is ok as long as it is not the weekend, unless your coming over to
buy
the 77 2.0 type IV motor sitting in front of the shop. It is a factory
assembly,
meaning it has never been torn down. Shroud and block carry matching numbers.
It came out of a chassis with 125k plus or minus. I did a leak down test on
no. 1 and 2 at less than 3%. No. 3 is leaking through the crankcase which
means
scoured cylinder and or warped rings. Having confirmed the problem, I haven't 
checked no. 4. This is a motor complete less FI gear and a few other pieces.
Could be a danged fine motor with just a piston and cylinder.

If that sounds interesting to you let me know and I will check no. 4 tomorrow
in 3.56 seconds and let you know.

If you want me to tear it down to VERIFY condition, that will cost $62 per
hour.

To pull the number 3 rod and inspect the rod bearing and journal would be
about
half an hour. To split the case and see the mains figure about 1.5 hours. 

Think what you would have. Spare heads, spare heat exchangers, spare heater
valves, about 80% spare tin, spare alturnator, spare space for me, and
enough remaining spare parts for a danged descent boat anchor.

The client who abandoned it here left $350 unpaid but I'm not sure I would
sell
it for that. I got a 72 kombi with a medium good 1.7 with original dual carbs
I been thinkun a puttin it in with dual Webers, a 3/4 race Ford flathead V-8
cam profile (loooong rod motors can make big low end torque dontcha know) and
then I could start a stump pullin business. 

If you think you would rather work with what you got, contact NW ConRod in
south Seattle. Let them know what your after. They would know better about
swapping parts between motors and if it is reasonable to grind that crank.

Regardless, we have Guiness on tap at the only tav in town and I would share
one with you any day, including weekends.
