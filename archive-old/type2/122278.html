Subject: Electrical problems 70 bus

Hi,
This is my first time posting here so hopefully I'm doing it right.  I have 
a 70 bus with electrical problems.  I removed the stereo that was installed 
by the PO and replaced it with another one with a working tape deck.  The PO 
had it wired rather unusually, but it worked so I used his wires.  He also 
has a switch he was using to operate the wipers so I'm assuming the switch 
for the wipers in the steering column went bad.  Anyway, I got the new 
stereo in and everything worked fine.  I drove it to the store, shut the bus 
off and came out about 15 mins later.  It cranked up fine and I drove home.  
The next day, I turned the key and the warning lights in the dash come on in 
the first position, but in the start position I get 1 click from the 
soleniod and nothing.  Then I can't get the warning lights or interior 
lights to come on.  Now I have charged the battery and can only get the 
warning lights to come on occassionally when unhook and rehook the negative 
terminal on the battery multiple times.  Once I get the warning lights to 
come on either turning the key to the start position, operating the head 
light switch or the emergency switch all cause the warning lights and 
interior lights to go out and the starter wont operate.  I've removed the 
stereo completely, removed the added wiper switch, removed the instrument 
panel and cleaned and inspected all wires and connections.  All the fuses 
are intact and I've studied the wiring diagram checking each wire for 
damage.  I even pulled the ignition switch when I could get the warning 
lights to come on and with the battery fully charged put a jumper from the 
red wire to red/black wire going to the starter.  The starter did then give 
1 click and all the lights went out again.  I tested the battery about a 
month ago and it tested ok, so I believe it is getting charged.  I'm not 
sure what to try next and am stuck here out in the country until I can get 
it running.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Sorry for the long 
message, I just wanted to make sure I included everything.  If it isn't 
obvious, I'm pretty new to all this.
Thanks,
Martin
