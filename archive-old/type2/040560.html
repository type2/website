have never heard of a half shaft going bad from use, I'm sure it has
happened but in 35 years of VW's I have never seen a bad one

&gt; I'll probably go ahead and replace the cv joints (about due according to
&gt; maintenance schedule).  Does the price quoted for CV Joints usually include

&gt; looking at buying 4 joints?

you will need 4, but they can be done one at a time

&gt; While I have the CV Joints apart, would this be an opportune time to go
&gt; ahead and replace the wheel bearings?

makes no difference they are independent of each other

you don't mention the year I am commenting on a late bay
