Dear list,
  I  have just joined the list, and I already have a problem. I have a 77 bus
with an Eberspacher BN-4 heater, and I'm trying to get it to work. I read Ron
van Ness' treatise on it in the archives, but I'm still unclear on where to
start fixing it. It has the timer switch in the dash, and it does tick when
you turn it. But the heater just doensn't do anything. Should I start by
checking the glowplug, or is it more likely that the problem is electrical???
  Any help appreciated,
Nicole
