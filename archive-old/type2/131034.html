Subject: Re: [T2] re work Eurovans

There are some diesel panel eurovans here in Canada with the turbo diesel
motors.
I heard through the shop they get crazy good gas mileage. Something like 36
mpg
(remember canadian gallons).  You can't get them in a passenger van and now
even
getting the current ones in a panel is nighimpossible.  Someone told VW that
no one in NorthAmerica is concerned with gas mileage.

Go figure

James

&gt; (sp), I have heard through the grapevine that he is going to, or is trying
to
&gt; import a few of the stripped Eurovans to
&gt; the U S. I just wonder if they are allready available in Canada.&gt;
