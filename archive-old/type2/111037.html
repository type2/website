Subject: Re: [T2] oil filter removal tool

as a previous post mentioned, you shouldn't need one.

however, i have used a scrap of sandpaper in a pinch before
&amp; it helped me get a good grip on the filter.

in fact, i just used this trick on my bus last month. i had to change
the oil filter from the PO.

i've also had to use this on my A*ura after it came
back from the dealer. needless to say, they won't be
changing the oil again - at least while i own the vehicle.
