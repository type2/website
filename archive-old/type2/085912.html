Subject: Re: [T2] Is my buss worth working on

&gt;There are a few things becides the rust that I need to fix on the buss so I 
&gt;want to know if the buss is worth working on, or if it´s better to start 
&gt;looking for a new one.

Hi Johan,

If you want a perfect &quot;show&quot; vehicle, you might want to find one with a 
little less rust. However, if you just want a solid daily driver, I'd say 
your bus is definitely salvageable.

The pictures do show some advanced rust problems, but most of it looks to be 
surface rust which is easy to fix. If you're going to try fixing this one, I 
would definitely recommend replacing all the window rubber -- especially 
around the windshield.

As long as the main beams are solid (they don't look too bad from the pics) 
I would say &quot;go for it&quot;!

Sean,
1970 Microbus (a work in progress / daily driver)
