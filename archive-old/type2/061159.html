Robin-
    I just got past the first stage of such a project. I bought a 72 Westy
(camper) with a blown engine and now have it on the road. It took longer
than I expected due to a bad but cheap engine. I ended up with an AVP
rebuild. But now it runs and it is great fun to drive. I think it has been
worthwhile.
     You must try and add up what it will take to pass inspection. Heat and
looks are optional, that depends on what you will put up with. You may
need: tires $250-350, an engine $800, (put it in yourself) shocks, brakes,
etc. Go to  busdepot_dot_com and add up some prices. Do you want to spend that
much over the $600. ?  If yes, then it's great.
   Oh, I forgot, you had an MGB... never mind.
    Take a good look at the front axle beam, the up and down braces and the
rest of it can rust out, then you replace the entire front assembly.
    This all is just my opinion, I'm glad I got the Westy, it was summer
and I had the time for it, but you have to be realistic. Pay attention to
what your VW mechanic friend says.
   Good luck, let us know if you get it.
