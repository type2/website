Subject: Rust-B-Gone &amp; Pious Panels

How about leaving the old floor and pop-riveting in some sheet aluminum over
the entire front floor area?  You could also add in a piece of felt on top
for some extra sound proofing.



They should rolls of aluminum sheets at the auto part store, and perhaps
even at a better price in a major hardware store.
