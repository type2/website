&gt; You get the picture. To make a multi weight oil say, 10-40, you use a
&gt; straight low carbon 10w and add polymers and other alchemicals to provide
&gt; the characteristics of the high weight rating. The lesson is, the lower
&gt; weight the base oil, the less carbon, and the less carbon deposit buildup
&gt; on pistons and combustion chambers.
&gt;

&gt;From http://vtr_dot_org/maintain/lubricants-redline.html under the section
titled Viscosity Index Improvers:
Rubber and Plastic Polymers
Start with a base of straight weight oil. Then add a polymeric thickener.
When hot, the long polymer chain is really moving around, causing the oil to
flow less. When cold, the polymers stick to each other, essentially coming
out of suspension. The polymers are stable up to about 210 F, where they
start to break up. The drawbacks to VI polymers is that they can cause
engine dirt because of their low shear strength.
* a chart is shown*
What this chart shows is that straight oil has the same viscosity regardless
of shear rate. However, as the shear rate increases, the shear breaks down
the VI polymers, and multigrade oils have less actual viscosity at the
localized high shear rate area. [in other words, when the polymers break
down, the oil becomes the base weight: 10/40 becomes 10 weight, 20/50
becomes 20 weight]
The weak link is the rod bearings and cam, in terms of rate of shear. There
is less friction at the piston rings. Anti-wear is much more important at
the cam.

&gt; Mercedes publishes a listing of brand name oils in the weights that are
&gt; approved for their cars and updates it every few years.
&gt;

Mercedes stopped listing name brands about 5 years ago. Now the 'approved
oil' sheet only specifies the oil grade required. As long as the brand of
oil meets or exceeds the S* or C* grade, you can use it.

BTW....the S and the C in the grading system stands for type of ignition
system. A gasoline engine uses spark to fire the mixture....the S stands for
spark. A diesel engine uses compression to fire the mixture... C stands for
compression.
