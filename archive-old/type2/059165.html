Subject: Re: disabling valves to stop oil leak

&gt; Instead of polluting the  highway with oil,
&gt; why didn't you try disabling the valves in that cylinder by pulling the

&gt; (2 nuts), and yanking the 2 pushrod tubes for the bad cylinder?  Then the
&gt; valves can't open, and the oil happily stays in the engine!  

First, pushrods - yes; pushrod tubes - NO! :-)

&gt; This assumes
&gt; you didn't break the valve, or you'd still get oil sloshing down the
&gt; exhaust port....Yes the followers get slapped a little (you'd have to
&gt; remove the hydraulic kind?), but it should work?? 

I haven't done it but, in the case of a burnt valve or piston, it ought to
work.  The danger is that in the case of a snapped valve, it is certain
death for the case.  Obviously in any circumstance where there is 0
compression on a cylinder, what you *want* to do is tow it home.  *BUT*
that is not always a realistic option, so what we are faced with is a
series of desperation moves, of which the one you outline sounds very good
to me.

Before this list existed, I had taken a number of cross country trips. 
One of things I was very aware of was that I might wind up walking away
from the bus and taking public transportation home.  Before I did that,
however, I had a plan very much like the one you propose in mind. 
Desperation is a mother of an inventor and some of those stretches of
highway are long and lonely enough to encourage really inventive thoughts
:-) 

Please note that part of the bet you are making is that no damaging bits
(valve head, piston rings) are floating about in the case.  If they are,
or if the piston is destroyed and the wrist pin is smacking the case,
then you will not be going more than another mile or two before something 
exits the case at high velocity and your trip is *over* :-( This is a bet
you may be forced into making, but not a pleasant one.

&gt; I'd pull the plug wire also.

Definitely! :-)

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
