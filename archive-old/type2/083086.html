Subject: RE: STOCK DUAL CARBS TO PORSCHE 1700 L-JET FI CONVERSION QUESTIONS???

Hello List,

Thanks you for all the advice so far. As far as what
type of system it is, I will read the description:

&quot;This is a complete working Porsche 914 L-Jet FI
system. EVERY part of the FI system just taken off a
working car - injectors, ECU, throttle body, intake
tubes, fuel pressure regulator, brackets, resistor
pack and everything else needed to convert your 914
1.7 or 1.8 back to factory specs if you have the stock
wiring, and get the most power out of your car!
Everything works, so save yourself THOUSANDS over the
cost of a new replacement system.&quot;

This is what I know about this system. How does it
sound?  Thanks!

David Kelly

&gt; &gt;chance to acquire a complete Porsche 1.7 L-Jet FI
&gt; system.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm assuming you're referring to a 914 FI system? 
&gt; The 70-74 1.7 used d-Jet, 
&gt; the 73-76 2.0 used d-Jet, and the 75-76 1.8 used
&gt; L-Jet.  So you need to re-
&gt; evaluate what you're looking at.  The 914 L-Jet is
&gt; virtually identical to the 
&gt; bus L-Jet.  The d-jet is an entirely different
&gt; animal.  Either can be used, but 
&gt; you need to know which one you're dealing with. 
&gt; Technically speaking, the L-
&gt; Jet is a newer, more advanced system than the d-Jet.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;what else would I need to convert from the stock
&gt; dual carbs 
&gt; &gt;to this FI system?
&gt; 
&gt; You'll need a gas tank with a fuel-return inlet.  So
&gt; you'll need to find one 
&gt; from a 76-79 bus (maybe Steve Dolan's recent
&gt; acquistion??).  You'll need to tap 
&gt; your cylinder head above #3 for the head temp
&gt; sensor.  Other than that, you 
&gt; just need EVERYTHING from the donor FI - wiring
&gt; harness, all 
&gt; sensors/senders/relays, brain, fuel pressure
&gt; regulator, fuel rails, injectors, 
&gt; distributor - everything.  You'll need seveal yards
&gt; of FI-rated fuel line in 
&gt; the correct size.  You'll need various lengths/sizes
&gt; of vacuum hose.  You can 
&gt; tie the whole system in with a few electrical
&gt; connections here and there.  And 
&gt; of course, you'll have to figure out how/where to
&gt; mount the other components.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Will the stock vacuum advance dizzy work with this
&gt; FI?
&gt; 
&gt; If you're looking at a d-Jet system, you HAVE to
&gt; have a distributor from a d-
&gt; Jet system.  There is a set of trigger points
&gt; mounted low in the body of the 
&gt; dizzy that sends signals to the ECU to fire the
&gt; injectors.  If it's indeed an L-
&gt; Jet FI, you'd still be better off using the correct
&gt; dizzy for the FI system, 
&gt; but you can get by with your old one.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I have an electric fuel pump from a F_at_RD Pick up.
&gt; Can I just 
&gt; &gt;use a regulator with this fuel pump?
&gt; 
&gt; There's been talk that a particual Ford (Ranger?) FI
&gt; pump will work just fine 
&gt; as a replacement, but you'll need to use the correct
&gt; pressure regulator from 
&gt; the FI system.  The old d-Jet systems use a fixed
&gt; regulator that you adjust to 
&gt; 30 PSI.  The L-Jet, if I'm not mistaken, uses a
&gt; vacuum-controlled regulator so 
&gt; you have more pressure when your engine is being
&gt; asked for more power (a better 
&gt; setup if you ask me).
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line, find out what kind of FI you're looking
&gt; at and you can get more 
&gt; precise answers.
