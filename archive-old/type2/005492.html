Subject: elec rebuild

Well after consulting the archives and getting several recommendations,  I
shall be sending my '77's engine to AVP in Sacramento this week.  Close
seconds were Boston Engine and Mark Stephens, but for longevity's sake AVP
got the vote. I'm especially pleased to find they were also the least
expensive-though that was low on the list of concerns. Shipping was
especially reasonable and they pick up the engine at your doorstep, so I'm
having mine shipped for the build so my numbers will be correct.
    What do you gurus recommend as to making such things as the alternator,
distributer, etc worthy to grace the &quot;new&quot; engine?  My alternater is 3 years
old, dizzy reblt with eng 8 yrs ago, starter 5 years old, coil-3years,
regulater-3 years.
    By my book, all electrical problems are nightmares, so I want all of
these pieces to be in order.  There is a local auto elec shop where one old
guy rebuilds lots of these and is widely respected, but it is probably very
rare that he sees a vw in these parts.  Now the Question:
    Do I need them rebuilt, tested, cleaned and oiled, or anything in the
way of attention  or should I &quot;dont fix what aint broken.&quot;
Also- anyone have engine tin?  My factory a/c will not be going back on the
bus as it was a foolish idea when new.  This will leave a large hole in the
left rear corner eng tin about the size of a large coffee can
top..(lightbulb)HMMM...nope-its stock or parked, so can somebody help here?
Please overwhelm me with input!  Thanks kind people!

The bus came by and I got on. Thats when it all began.
