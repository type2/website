Subject: Re: [T2] Spark plugs for 1977 Bay

I missed the start of this thread but,
Wow, I have always re-gapped my plugs and keep them in spec, I even used to
file them flat (I'm not that desperate anymore). I must say that I've never
noticed much of an improvement when I put new plugs in though? I normally
expect 25-30K out of a good set of Bosch plugs.
What you say makes sense though, and they are cheap relative to other
running costs!!
Richard,

&gt;Negatory. At 0.2mm wear over spec, replace them. Never regap worn plugs.
&gt;Rounded electrodes do not offer nearly as good a spark as new plugs with
&gt;sharp edges. You can expect 2 or 3 or more miles per gallon better with new
&gt;plugs.
