Subject: early engine in 72 bus

Thanks for all the info.
I guess that I will investigate the curre nt engine that is in the 72
It is a pancake and the owners mother does not know what is wrong, she says
that it runs but everything looks dissassembled.

If I do not buy this I wil post it to the list as it seems that $400 asking
for a running rustfree 72 bus is not bad.
