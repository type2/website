WOOPS! I be disinformed!

&gt;Those volvo seats sound convincingly comfortable, though!  But if 
&gt;you put leather seats in a bus, doesn't the VW chassis reject a

Surprisingly not, but after all if VW had any idea of the weird types that 
would be driving their busses in the '90s, they would'a put heated 
leather seats in 'em to begin with!  So there! :)  

AND those poor old leather Volvo seats just LOVE moving UP to a
fine classic German wheeled-box.
