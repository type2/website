&gt; Er, never say never, last westy I bought had a red ground wire, went to

Amen to that!  Often the parts place will have a red wire that is the
correct length for the ground or a black for the positive.  The electrons
don't care about the color.  I have a black wire on my
positive lead for that reason, with the stock ground braid on the other
side.  I never really thought about it before!
