Subject: RE: [T2] New bus....

&gt;So I just got a bus off ebay for 1000 dollars
Very cool. What year is it?


&gt;First, the battery is constantly going dead on me. My guess is the 
&gt;alternator
&gt;or the starter, but I can't tell cause it's so
&gt;inconsitent.

If your lights and other electrical work but the starter doesnt' turn over 
then it might be the starter. When they go out the are finicky and sometimes 
spin and sometimes don't.  I know with generators there's a really easy way 
to test what it's putting out but I don't know how to do that with 
alternators. Maybe with the bus running disconnect the battery and if it 
dies the altenators probably toast. Also there is a procedure to test the 
starter as well.

&gt;Second, the gas guage does not work.  That's pretty
&gt;straight forward.

Actually this really sucks if it's the sending unit. It sucks to get to the 
gas tank and while you there you might as well treat it for rust.


&gt;Last, I am planning on putting a couch in the back. Does anyone know the 
&gt;legality of that

I don't think there would be a legal problem as along as it was bolted down 
and had seatbelts.
