Shelby,

I used to ride motorcycles back in the early seventies (when I was, er,
negative 8 years old). It was considered rude not to throw a wave to another
motorcycle rider, regardless of the make/model of his bike. I mean, even the
Hells Angels dudes would at least nod their heads back to me.

These days, it's a much more select group of folks that'll muffle their
machoness for the moment to acknowledge another person.

Recently, I was on the way home, and saw a red bug stopped by the side of
the freeway, so I stopped behind him. As we were doing some basic debugging,
up walks a guy from behind us to check if things are OK. I look back to see
he was driving a Karmann Ghia! We didn't get the bug running (bad coil), but
I at least got the guy off the freeway to a comfortable restaurant where he
could make all his phone calls.

So, the &quot;magic&quot; still exists, it's just practiced amongst fewer &quot;magicians&quot;.
Shhh - don't tell anybody the secret.

Shelby, who's frustrated with humanity, blurted:

&gt; until finally another jeep, bound by unwritten law,
&gt; stopped and picked me up, no questions asked.   thats
