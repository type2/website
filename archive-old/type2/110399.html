Subject: Twin Cities Volkswagen Show

Hi All!

It's time again for the Annual Twin Cities Volkswagen show!  This year It 
will be held on Sunday 1 June at the usual site, Westside Volkswagen in Saint 
Loius Park, Minnesota.  Start time is 9:00am and should end at 3:00 pm.  
Westside is just off of County Road 100.

Last year there were quite a few Type IIs in attendance, more than I had ever 
seen before.  Let's make it more!
