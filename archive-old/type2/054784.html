Subject: molybdenum vs. moly-graph

ok folks, I got a bently, and found that I need molybdenum  grease on the 
throw out bearing sleeve(also found out the sleeve means I have a later 
tranny) But when I went to the flaps all I found was moly-graph, molybdenum 
grease with graphite added. And ever since I found out about the whole GL-4 
vs. GL-5 thing, I've been a little paranoid. will it be ok to use the 
moly-graph in any aplication on our v-dubs calling for molybdenum?
thanks
Ronnie
