Your gas mask idea is good, but you need to attach a vacuum cleaner running
backwards to the fresh air end of your hose, otherwise you will just be
rebreathing the first couple of feet of air in your hose.  Or, if there are
valves in the system you will be working too hard just to breathe; let the
vacuum cleaner supply the air.  A good 3/4inch wqter hose will supply plenty
of air from a vacuum cleaner.  Used firefighting breathing apparatus will do
well, too, -- for the masks and such.  There may be places near you that
stock the used stuff, cuz the fire depts have to replace it on a schedule
regardless of whether it is working OK or not.

&gt;&gt;breathing apparatus is the way to go (not one of those .99 dust masks). Why
&gt;&gt;not error on the side of caution, it is your brains, lungs etc??? I can't
&gt;&gt;understand why people would wanna breathe that stuff in?? If anyone wants
&gt;
&gt;Buy a respirator now or you'll need a more expensive one later, right?  I
&gt;agree with safety first, I think what stops people is the $$ or $$$ for a
&gt;good unit and the intangible rewards for the investment (i.e. longer life,
&gt;less health problems).   
&gt;
&gt;Here's a hairball idea I've had (I currently don't have a breathing
&gt;apparatus aside from my own lungs, that is):  I was thinking of taking one
&gt;of those army surplus gas masks and fitting it with a long hose that I could
&gt;place outside my workspace near a clean air source.  It seems like an
&gt;affordable way to avoid paint fumes/sawdust--I don't know how large the hose
&gt;would have to be or the limits of its length for safe breathing--I figure
&gt;after passing out a few times for lack of 02, I'll eventually get it right
&gt;;).  I haven't tried making one yet, just thought I'd &quot;throw the idea in the
&gt;air.&quot;
