Subject: Re: Propane Conversion

I have been mulling this type of coversion myself for some time,  What I
have seen from my internet research, is that comparably sized motors (say
2L to 2L) one would get about a 20% power loss from using propane versus
gasoline,  Soemthing about the BTUs (I am not a chemist or a physicist).
Can we afford a 20% power loss on a 67 hp engine?

I plan a subaru conversion at some point in my almost rust free 78.  The
subaru ea-81 is an almost bombproof carbed engine, also a boxer. No timing
belts.  The only concern is - can one use a spfi (single port, like a
throttle body) injection with propane? or, does one have to use a mpfi?
The subie guys on the USMB have had success with swapping both from the
ea-82 to the ea-81, but the wiring and other stuff is obviously simpler
for the spfi.  With gas, they claim the spfi on an EA-81, one could get
about 90hp, take the 20% loss (72hp) that propane could cause, and the we
are still more than the type 4 stock made.

So many ideas, so many questions, not enough money, nor time.

&gt;
&gt; The key difference between water cooled and aircooled engines is that the
&gt; propane (which is a liquid in the tank) must be a gas when going through
&gt; propane carburetors.  In water cooled engines, this is accomplished by
&gt; devising a heat exchanger with the coolant.  It does not take much, but
&gt; one must address this.  The tank is more sophisticated, the propane is a
&gt; liquid at high pressure at normal temperatures, something like 120-150
psi (temp dependent, of course).   I suspect that one could get a used
storage tank, like those seen frequently in rural areas (god's gas is
propane), and tank you bus from home.  One could also plan to use the
small &quot;blue rhino&quot; when desperately in need of fuel.

&gt; I believe that one could inject liquid LPG, must like a gasoline fuel
&gt; injection, if one had a completely tunable fuel injection system (like a
&gt; Megasquirt).

&gt; I have read that most motor vehicles in the Netherlands run on LPG.  There
&gt; is a company that imports new A/C busses from Brazil to England and
&gt; converts
&gt; them to LPG fuel.
