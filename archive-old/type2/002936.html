Hey Burnaby Joe!

I too am from Vancouver BC....I own a 74 Westy who is sadly not on the road
at this time :(
The best place I've found in the area is a shop called Hansig in Burnaby.
His number is in the yellow pages. He's great but a little more expensive
and ALWAYS busy. The other place I've taken my  van is to VanWonder in North
Van. The guys name is John and he has helped me out a few times. As for
parts and yards I haven't found or heard of any really good ones but I
haven't looked that hard either...
Good luck!
