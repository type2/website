Subject: Difference between 78 and 79s..

Is there an easy way to VISUALLY tell the difference between a 78 and
79?  I know they have different exhausts, but is it an apparent
difference?  There is a bus I'm purchasing and it's a 78 and I just want
to make sure it's not a 79 engine.  I checked the engine codes and it's
a GE, and Unca Joel Walker's FI interchange lists a GE case as used on
both the 78 and 79 engines..

Any insight would be welcome..

Thanks!
Mike
