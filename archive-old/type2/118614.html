Subject: Broken braking?... resolution.

Volk-a-maniacs,

Well it seems that consensus is that I need to replace the rubber brake lines.
I'll order a set and swap them out.  I've seen people chatting on the list
about swapping out all 4 when you do it, so I will do all four.

As for the other hints, tire pressure and suspension, they appear to be ok,
but I will certainly give them a good going over while I am swapping the brake
lines.

Thanks,
Greg
