I inspected all the lines before I drove it the 1000 miles home.  

The only line I didn't check was a short rubber hose on the fuel tank 
breather.  I stopped for gas in New Jersey and the attendant overfilled the 
tank causing gas to run into the engine compartment for 20 minutes.  The gas 
dripped down into the driver's side battery tray and I just pulled the rubber 
plug out and let the gas run onto the ground.  I flushed the area with water 
and was unable to move the bus for over an hour.  

I pulled the rotted hose off the line and replaced it with a hose I had 
brought.  I didn't have enough tubing with me to be able to siphon off the 
tank.  I did bounce on the rear bumper to get as much gas as I could out of 
the filler neck.  

I refused to pay the full price the pump said, since at least a gallon or 
more was now on the ground.  The attendant claimed he didn't top it off.  I 
learned my lesson to never ever get gas again in New Jersey, where there is 
no self serve.
