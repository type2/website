Subject: Pushrods for hydraulic lifter motors

Was disassembling 2-3 1.8L and 2.0L type IV motors over the last week
or so and discovered that they almost all have the same pushrods in them
regardless of lifter set-up (solid or hydraulic)...

	can this be correct???

	Luckily, I kept the original pushrods from the 2.0L separate...

	if these are all the same, I'll put them away to use in some other
project...

	On another note: does anyone need a couple of 1.8L
crankshaft/connecting rod/camshaft sets??  Free to good home, WILL NOT
SHIP...  Must be picked up in Nashua, NH...

	Take Care...
