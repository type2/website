Subject: Wheel stud information sought.
Message-ID: &lt;7uev93$rllf_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Hi Volks,
	  I'm looking for some information on the sizes of the wheel
studs on busses, and how they changed for later years. If anyone can
offer any measurements part numbers or catalogue information, I'd
appreciate it.
 I have a '77 camper and I'm looking for longer studs (my new wheels
are thicker). I have read that Vanagon (T25/T3?), synchro and even LT 
studs are longer and can be used as relacements and was wondering if
anyone can help with more information.
 Did the T3 vanagons use bolts instead of studs? I get that impression
from the archives...

 My current information is:

	Application		Part No.	length

 T2 ('70-) stock front stud:	211-405-591
 T2 ('70-) stock rear stud:	211-501-627A	35mm

 Any contributions gratefully received.

Cheers,
	W.
