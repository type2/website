Subject: Re: [T2] Which engine should I use for my 73 Westy?  Found a 2 L I think?

Looks like I may have answered my own question here from looking at the
type2 library.  According to that if it's a 75 engine it's a 1.8L.   If it
is a 1.8 does that engine use the same injectors, manifold, harness and
brain as the 2.0?  I'd like to end up with a 2.0 so it might be worth
picking this engine up to get all the other parts I need if they will
interchange.  I'll check the case codes to try and get a better idea of what
the engine is when I see it.

&gt; Thanks to everyone that replied to my questions about an engine for my 73
&gt; Westy.  I still haven't been able to catch the person at home that's
selling
&gt; this type 4 engine but I did find out more info on it and will get to see
it
&gt; tomorrow.  The engine is complete, pulled out of a 75 bus. It has all the
FI
&gt; parts, brain, harness, etc, also complete with all tin and exhaust so it
&gt; should be just what I need for my bus since I don't have any of those
parts.
&gt; The person selling it said he drove the bus and has the engine on the
ground
&gt; now but I can see it run.  If it's the original engine from a 75 then it
&gt; should be a 2 liter shouldn't it?   Also will the 75 engine mate up with
my
&gt; 73 tranny/bell housing?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; John
