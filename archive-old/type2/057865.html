Subject: Another Bus

Bill Keeting and I went down to Art Long's in OKC. We towed
back an organ donor for my 79. I am going to pull the engine
for a spare, pop the windshield, gas fired heater and a few
window handles and what have you to finish up my bus.

The deal went smooth the bus was just what I expected and
a little more. Art's a little richer and on better terms with his
wife. I was tempted to make his wife happier buy buying the
motor cycle in his yard but I have to live with my wife so I
declined. Thanks to Art for the bus and thanks to Bill for moral
support. Fortunately I didn't need any of his VW expertise.

Most of the sheet metal is ok and there is very little rust. Art
told me he got it because the transmission went out. It appears
to have a complete airconditioner.

I will be passing it on to the next guy that needs what's left.
I will keep it in rolling so you can tow it. Any one interested?
It is in storage so there is no real rush to get rid of it. I am
going to wait until it cools off to do much. It would rebuild
pretty well it some one had and engine and transmission from
a wreck needing a body.
