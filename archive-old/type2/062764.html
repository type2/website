Subject: Re: Porta-Potti Help, Suggestions

To John Brown re portable toilet:
   We use the PakaPotti from Sears; it's narrower, fits between front seats
or between rear seat and Sink cabinet in 78 Westie- a little smaller than
PortaPottie, but easier to lug bottom part to any toilet and dump it in.
It can smell &quot;chemicallly&quot; depending on what holding tank stuff you buy; We
use the dry packets because they don't have that formaldehyde smell of the
liquid stuff.  They have a sliding valve that seals off most of the smell;
it's less smell if you sit on it BEFORE opening up the valve, but then you
risk changes in air pressure blowing a cloud of wet gas on your butt, so
remember to crack valve once before you lift the lid &amp; close it, then sit
down and OPEN!!!  Use the dissolving paper or toss it into the garbage or
it will be harder to drain the tank without a hose and lots of flushing; If
not at a campground, I've done it in the bathtub (fill to flush) and pour
into toilet.  Fun but beats the poison Ivy in the bushes or take your risks
rest rooms....MB
