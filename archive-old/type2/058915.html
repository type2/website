&gt; I just heard that letting a bus sit with the ignition switch on, but

&gt; Can anybody confirm this? 

Well, I don't know about the points, tho I believe it might.  The thing I
*am* sure it will damage is your coil!  When the points are open the
battery is feeding 12V to the coil. Normally, this lasts a fraction of a
second and the coil builds up a tremendous charge which is fed to the plug
to cause the spark.  If the engine is not turning and the points are in
the wrong position, the energy feeds in, but is never discharged to the
plug.  Instead it builds up as heat, which will cook the coil! 

&gt; 
&gt; I've been trying to track down the cause of a really strange surging
&gt; idle and a loss of power overall and a mechanic friend asked if that
&gt; might be the problem. 

Probably not, for the surging idle; definitely yes, for the loss of power.
Have you checked the spark color?  You may need a new coil!

&gt; 
&gt; Is replacing the points a tough thing to do? 

Nope, one little screw and one push-on plug.  Re-adjusting dwell and
timing afterwards are a bit toughter, but not too hard.

&gt; Anybody got any helpful hints? 

Don't drop the screw into the dist!!!!!!! :-)))

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
