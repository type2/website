Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Seating Question

&gt; trying to make up my mind on if you get more in a 74 - 75 westy, than a
&gt; 68 - 73 and  76-79. Also, Do seatbelts come for the Jumpseat on a 68 -
&gt; 73 and if not, is it a good idea to fit them, and have someone ride
&gt; there. OR, is the jumpseat just for when people are eating in the back?

76-79 have seat belts for 4, and I doubt a 5th person could sit 
comfortably (if at all) on the rear bench, since it's only 3/4 width 
(fridge/closet are on the left side of the Bus).

That said, I personally think the 76-79 Westy interior layout is the 
best of all of them because the room isn't broken up, and you have that 
groovy captain's chair on the passenger's side.

Regarding seating a passenger in the jump seat -- I'm not sure that's 
such a good idea.  Even if it was safe (which I'm not sure it would 
be), that's serious car-sick material facing backward in a moving car 
:-)  I'm pretty sure there is not a seat belt there in the stock 
configuration.

&gt; I know I have been throwing a lot of questions out to this group, it is
&gt; just that I want to get one, and I want to get a good fit with whatever
&gt; I get.

Personally, I would get a '76-79.  They have the best interior layout 
(IMHO :-), the large pop-top that can sleep two adults (even a one 6'4&quot; 
like me!), and the 2.0L fuel injected engine.  I would avoid a '75 ... 
lots of 1-year-only parts on that year, IIRC.  I think the best years 
are 76-78 ... many of the parts for those years are interchangeable (of 
course, the exception is the &quot;early 76&quot;, like mine, which seems to have 
some stuff in common with '75).  '79 is another 1-year-only parts year 
... well, it shares some with the Vanagon, like the cylinder heads and 
the electronic ignition (California model).
