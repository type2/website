Subject: [T2] Top end problems, 2liter motor

Ok folks,
    Trying to dial in my 2 liter with dual 34 Webers.  Spoke with Ronnie at
Kymco, and he recommended looking at the plugs for lean mixture did that,
and began to increase main jet size.  Started at 140, and am now at 165.
Great bottom end acceleration, through 3 gears ( for vanagon westy), but
when I hit 4th gear about 55mph, acceleration comes to a standstill.  It is
pretty flat where I live, and it is a slow climb to 65.

The dizzy is an 009, set at 28 degrees total advance.  New rebuild, 1000
miles on it.

I do have jet drills..  Any ideas?
