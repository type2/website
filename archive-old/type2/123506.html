Subject: It runs! 

I finally found the time and good weather to try running the
re-rebuilt engine in my '82 aircooled Westy.

And it RUNS!

The improvements over the time before my re-rebuild are:
a. Engine starts immediately. No need to crank and crank and crank.
b. Manifold vacuum of 15 inch Hg compared to 10 Hg
c. The idle screw actually results in changing the idle speed

Now I need to tweak the mixture screw on the airbox. I just bought an
air/fuel mixture gauge in order to tap into the O2 sensor circuit. I
 am hoping that this will allow me to see if the mixture is too lean
or rich. Does anyone think that this will not work?

For the folks who don't know. This is an AVP rebuilt engine I got 2
Novembers ago. It had never run right with compression of 60 in two
cylinders. I finally pulled it several months ago to put in new
hydraulic lifters from CB Performance and new Spanish heads.

The real test will come next week when I change the oil and actually
take it for a drive. I did the usual cam/lifter break in today,
bothering all the neighbours ;-)
