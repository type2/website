Hi Laura,

Not only do the windows fog up, but with continued heavy use through 
the winter you can develop a deep layer of frost covering the entire 
interior of the bus.

This happened to me the winter of 99/00 when I ran my 73 camper through 
the winter heated only with an extremely rusty set of heater boxes and 
a large catalytic propane heater. I was working the midnight shift at 
the time and most of the drive's home in the morning were accompanied 
by much ice-scraping to remove the frost from *inside* the windshield. 
By March it looked like it had snowed *INSIDE* the bus, with a heavy 
layer of ice crystals everywhere.

If the temperature of the interior gets warm enough to allow the 
moisture to evaporate, great. But if you're going to be driving the bus 
through an extended period of near-zero fahrenheit  I would strongly 
recommend looking for a dryer heat source, like a furnace or better 
heater boxes.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; products
&gt; is water vapor so plan for your window to fog up! Laura :o)
