&gt; &gt; Actually, the best antenna is a quarter-wave on 11m, which is a
&gt; &gt; straight whip 108 inches long.  This is 9 feet long, and
&gt; unfortunately
&gt; &gt; when you put this on top of a bus you end up with an overall height
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; 15 feet, a bit more than the 13-1/2 feet allowed.  This is why I
&gt; &gt; recommend the 6 foot helical Firestik.
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen the 9-foot whips mounted on rear bumpers or even low on the
&gt; side of a bus (e.g., near the rear side marker lights), which keeps
&gt; the
&gt; height down.  

Yes, but the problem is that the close proximity of the antenna to the
sheet metal of the side/rear of the bus will play havoc with matching. 
Even if you do get it matched, the antenna waving back and forth and
inch or two will mess things up.  It _can_ be done, but the results
won't be good.
