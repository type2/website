Subject: Odd power loss

On my FI '76 Westy, I am experencing an odd problem. The bus is losing power
every so often, and it's becoming more frequent. At first I suspected it was
electrical, like I turned the key off. But I now suspect it is fuel
related - almost seems like fuel starvation. The first thing I checked was
my fuel filter. Had an extra one, so I just changed it out. I still have the
problem. Could my fuel pump have something to do with this?

BTW, the power loss is very brief- only twice has it actually stalled...
even then it starts right back up. Most often, though, it's at speed that I
lose power.. only for 5 seconds or so, then I'm alright.

Any ideas?

Thanks!

Jeff
