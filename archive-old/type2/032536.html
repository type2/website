Jim and All;

Camper conversion interior layout and equipment are a matter of personal 
preference -- some like the early baywindow Westfalia layout, others prefer 
the late baywindow Westy layout or the Riviera design.

But if I had my &quot;druthers&quot;, I'd go for a Riviera poptop every time.  I have 
considerable experience with the &quot;patented Martin Walter Dormobile sleeping 
top&quot; and both baywindow Westfalia poptop designs.  None of these can hold a 
candle to the Riviera poptop.  Not only are the sleeping arrangements 
&quot;upstairs&quot; the best of the bunch, the engineering and hardware used on the 
Riviera top are much more robust then those used by Westfalia.

I've driven Westfalia Campmobiles for 20 years, and have camped all over the 
Northwest in Westys with both poptop designs.  I still wish my Campmobile had 
a Riviera poptop.  Purists will shriek when they read this, but when you spend 
a lot of time actually camping in your camper there's simply no contest.

All in all, my Riviera probably isn't &quot;worth&quot; as much as a similiar Westy, but 
it does the job just as well, if not better than a Westy.  (And the Riviera 
easily sleeps four adults. The Westy, two adults and a couple of small to 
medium sized kids.)
