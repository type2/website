Subject: F-Birthday parties anyone?

  Next February my van turns 25.  It seems to me that there ought to be
some kind of celebration after a quarter century for the little blue beast.
And I see by the stats that there are 27 others on this list who own '72
vans (is there numerical significance in these reversible numbers?  So does
anyone owning a '72 plan to celebrate?  How?  Or is this just the dumbest
thing you ever heard of?
  And how about the 42 listers who have '71 vans and this year passed the
quarter-century mark?  Anyone have a little party or hang a banner from the
antenna or anything?
