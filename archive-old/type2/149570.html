Subject: Friday post: Corvair for sale in MD

     I know the Corvair engine is a pretty popular conversion for the 
busses.  On a local classified site I found a corvair for sale for $150.  I 
spoke to the guy that's selling it and he says it's a rust-bucket without a 
title, but it runs quite well and the tranny is good.  I'm not selling it.  
Here's the ad info:

1967 Corvair Monza 2dr ht, it has a good 6 cylinder engine and
powerglide automatic transmission, and four new tires. But the
body is rusty and it has not been on the road for many years. It
is complete and would be a good parts car. I am not going to try
to restore it because it needs so much work.

     For an additional... oh let's say $200 to me, I would pick this car up 
from the guy and pull the engine and tranny for you, and store it at my 
place for an few extra months until you can pick it up.  I'd also want to 
keep any other parts I can strip off the car to sell on ebay.  Yeah, I know 
that's kind of high, but I don't really want to fool with it so that's the 
amount that would make it worth it to me :-))
