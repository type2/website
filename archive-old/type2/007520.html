Subject: Oil everywhere: from where?
Date: Sat, 31 Oct 1998 22:24:05 -0600

I have a 1982 aircooled westie. I have had this problem of oil loss while
doing highway driving. 

I recently drove to Atlanta from Little Rock, Arkansas and used 2 quarts of
oil along the way. I stopped for gas and noticed white smoke rising and
much oil dripping from under the buss... I note that there is oil ON TOP of
the engine... and it is gertting into the fan and being sprayed around
inside the engine compartment. The engine otherwise operates fine... just
getting sick of having to clean oil off of the back of my vanagon where it
sprays all over the rear window. 

Note: the following things have been done in an attempt to fix this
problem: rear main oil seal replaced, pushrod tube seals replaced with
Viton seals, oil pressure switch replaced. 

I think it might be coming out of the Breather Tube because the top fitting
always seems to be soaked with oil... also the dipstick always seems to be
slipping out. Might this be piston blow-by getting into the crankcase and
causing the oil to squirt out of the dipstick tube and crankcase breather
tube?
