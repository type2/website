Subject: Progressive Solex Carb C34TCIC13 air filter needed

I recently bought a 73 Bus that is missing the air filter.  By searching the web I have found out that it is a fairly rare Progressive 2BBL Carb that tried to compete with Weber but never made it.  Does anyone have a part number for the filter?  It is about a 6 inch oval filter, I have the bracket so am looking for a paper or whatever material filter.  The local part's store was no help and I couldn't find anything on the web.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  

Thanks,

Kevin
