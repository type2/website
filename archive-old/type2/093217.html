Subject: Re: [T2]  A junkyard motor

Since it is so complete do a compression test before you give over some 
cash. If it is VERY complete then run it.

Beware that the engine may be thrashed badly or built so with such wild 
modifications that it is not usable on the street (wild cam, wild heads, 
etc.).

Good luck.



&gt;Well yesterday I was at my local junkyard and I came a cross someones old
&gt;drag bug, looks like it was in an accident, I pulled off the deck lid and
&gt;what sits there is the motor and tranny still there! and they look way to
&gt;clean ,there is oil in it and it looks like it was just changed too, the
&gt;motor doesn't have the cooling shroud or a alt mount(its blocked off with a
&gt;chrome plate). I can turn it over buy hand , the owner of the yard says the
&gt;old owner says it runs. My question is what are some thing I should look for
&gt;that might cause some problem . ohh yea they said I could have the motor and
&gt;tranny for $350, so Im sure I can talk them down to $250:)
