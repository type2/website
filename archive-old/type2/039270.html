Subject: Re: Exhaust Wrap Good Idea?

Gentlepersons-
                       I've cross checked the exhaust wrap on a couple of 
other lists, and the
general consensus is, yes, the wrap does &quot;work&quot; but you lose the manifold as 
a result.
J. C. Whitney sells the wrap, if that is any indication of a recommendation 
to you...
                       The one coating I found with the most +'s was a 
ceramic coating at
&lt;http://www.hpcoatings_dot_com&gt; No idea as to pricing, but since it's in the 
racing arena,
my guess would be not cheap. Might be worth it in the long run though.
                       Any thoughts from the more metal-familiar list members?
