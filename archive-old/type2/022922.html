Jason:

My 69 Westy has an elastic net with a wire frame that hangs above the rear 
bed.  But my Westy has a poptop, and from what I know, the poptop Westies 
have the net; the hardtop Westies have a shelf (I have a 74 hardtop Westy, 
and it has a shelf, and shelf is made from and looks identical to the 
material the cabinets are made of).

My Westy manuals (1968 and 1970) say otherwise.  The 1968 manual only 
mentions the net, and my 1970 manual only mentions the ceiling 
cabinet.  The 1974 Westy manual I have says that only hardtop Westies have 
the ceiling cabinet.  Go figure...

I'm 99% sure what my 1969 Westy has is correct.  The only thing I've messed 
with is adding an electric pump to the sink.  I kinda wish I had the rear 
cabinet so I had somewhere nice to mount some rear speakers.  But the net 
is handy for storing stuff at night when you're sleeping back there.

I'd go snap some pictures, but my Westy is 300 miles from me right now..

&gt;Hi Joe.
&gt;
&gt;I recently bought a 69 hardtop Westy. (sorry, no manual) but I was 
&gt;wondeirng if you know wether yours is unaltered, what is above your rear 
&gt;bed area?
&gt;Mine has a plywood shelf, but no front on the shelf, and the wood is wood, 
&gt;not laminate like the cabinets. So I eckon it was put there by a PO.
&gt;Someone else said there is a net that goes over there instead of a shelf, 
&gt;but VW had the shelf in 67 and I remember it in my dad's 72.
&gt;
&gt;Whatcha got?
