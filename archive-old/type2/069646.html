Subject: Historical changes 62-63

I think it was Thom F. who was uncertain of when the small window/big window
change occured. I just flipped the month on my very cool officialized
NEATO/Bulli Catel/SSVC (UK) calendar. The &quot;History:&quot; text (with apologizies
to the clubs) reads:

August 1, 1962: Divided front seat replaced bench type seat (VIN 971 550)
August 1 1963: large rear window replaces small window, larger tailgate
fitted (VIN 1 144 282). High Roof models continue with small rear windows
until 1967.

More historical blurbs are mentioned but you'd know that if you were a
member of any of these clubs and were enjoying this excellent calendar!

Contact Tom Brouillette at neato_at_rt66_dot_com regarding membership of any of
these organizations!

Unofficially, I have always been under the impression that the corner
windows were last seen in the 1963 model year. 21 windows were
&lt;unfortunately&gt; the *(US) max starting in '64. So much for the '66 23 that
was recently FS.
