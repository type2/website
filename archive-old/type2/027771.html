Subject: Help!  Motor Starts and dies
Content-type: text/plain; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I found a motor that had not been running for a while.  Cleaned the carb, 
filed and gapped points, changed dist. cap and rotor, plugs, wires and 
adjusted the valves.  When I installed it I got it to run by choking 
it(by putting my hand over the carb).  It ran for a few seconds, say... 
5-10 secs. and died. 
Even if I try to accelerate it it dies.  
But if when it's going to die, I choke it again... it will run for 
another 5-10 seconds and dies.  In conclusion the only way I can get it 
to try to run is by choking it over and over.
I checked that the fuel pump is pumping... which it is.

Any ideas on what I might check?
Could the coil do this?
Any help is greatly appreciated,

Thank You,

Joe
