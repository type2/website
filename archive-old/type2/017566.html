Third reply in a night ! - Someone tell me if I'm boring you...

I did this last Sunday!

The top edge of the cover (1971) is wedged into a channel under the window. The
plastic beading strip wraps around the edge of the cover and helps jam it in. I
managed to loosen one end by pounding the lip of the cover upwards with by hand,
but couldn't get any further like this (it hurts, for one thing!). Eventually
resorted to using a hammer on a length of lath inserted up inside the cover.
(there are ~3/4 inch gaps in the retaining channel where you can get the wood to
bear directly on the cover. I didn't do any damage like this, despite having to
hammer until the wood was splintering, and weilding a hammer in *very* close
proximity to the bodywork. The damage came when the cover pinged off and I
didn't catch it - just a few paint chips on the cover. I don't know if you can
still get the beading strip (mine is intact), but it appears to be different to
the one on the other side, and looks fairly cruical to getting the cover to fit
back on.

Out of curiosity, why are you removing it ? (My reason was to fit the window
glass above it.)

I'll shut up, now.
