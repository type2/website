Jack...and &quot;the list&quot;

FWIW...I bought one of these a few weeks ago to help me sort out a fuel delivery
problem on my SOs Golf...didn't cheap on the quality, considering it's gasoline
under pressure we're playing with...$53 at CTC here in Canada....worked like a
charm.

Manufacturer is:
Actron Manufacturing
Cleveland, Ohio

Model CP7818F

Good luck all..

Den.
