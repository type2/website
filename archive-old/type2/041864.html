Thanks Ian,

I think my readings are just about the same as yours.  I see 425 only under
load up hill.  I found that 375-400 was typical in 90+ degree heat.  My flaps
are disconnected and are in the default position of open, so I don't see any
change.

Curiously, though, after about 3-4 hours of driving the engine cools down by
about  25-50 degrees.  This happened 3 days straight. I am not sure why, the
ambient changed but not more than 10 degrees. Hmmm....

&gt; I have a 82 vanagon with a 78 engine.  I just installed a VDO head temp
&gt; guage under the spark plug and am seeing 375-425 readings on the highway at
&gt;  65 in 90 degree heat.
&gt; I've been watching my gauges for the past couple of weeks, since someone
&gt; asked about temps.  I have an 82 Westy with automatic and a rebuilt engine
&gt; with about 10,000 miles on it.  I use 20-50 oil.  Ambient temps here in
&gt; Victoria are about 75 -80 these days.  My oil pressure at speed is 55 lbs,
&gt; 25 at idle.  Oil temp max is 215.  Cylinder head runs up to about 385
&gt; before the flap opens fully and drops the temp back to 350.  On long trips
&gt; up steep hills in hot weather I THINK I've seen 425, but not so far this
&gt; year.  My bumper gets hot because it's right over the muffler (non-stock).
&gt; The dipstick is hot, but bearable.
