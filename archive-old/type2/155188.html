Subject: Body Shop Referral Needed Maryland

Haven't been able to connect with Tommy, per earlier discussion on this 
subject; but my neighbors Fred &amp; Sue had a Ford Aerostar painted at Bob's 
autobody in Queenstown.  Price came in around $1000 and the result looks very 
good.  They were satisfied.  Tel# for Bob is 410 827 3100.  Shop is located 
behind R. B. Baker company, 509 on mailbox.  From Annapolis, across the bridge, 
then ~12 miles take the left fork on 301 for Wilmington; within ~1 mile look on 
left for Queenstown veterinary clinic, grey frame building; flashing yellow 
light at intersection.  Turn left; look for Bakers within first mile or so.

If I can help further pls p-mail.
