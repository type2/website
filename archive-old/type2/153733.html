Subject: Re: [T2] Can I switch Vacuum cans on these distributors? No, I
  can't!

Removed the old vacuum can on the Federal distributor and went to remove the 
can on the California distributor when I realized the two vacuum cans are 
attached differently on the two distributors.  Although the cans are held in 
place with two screws in both cases, the position of the screws is different 
on the two cans, meaning I'd have to drill and tap the Federal distributor 
body to get this to work, which I can do.  Of course, before I drill and tap 
I'd have to remove the guts of the distributor to give me room to work. 
Maybe I'll just order one from BD.

Subject: [T2] Can I switch Vacuum cans on these distributors?

&gt; I believe the vacuum can on my 1982 (Federal) Vanagon is bad.  I happen to 
&gt; have a good vacuum can from a 1981 (California) Vanagon.
&gt;
&gt; Looking just at the advance specs in the TypeII library I read:
&gt;
&gt; Vacuum: 9-12deg Adv _at_ 8.2 In. Hg (Cal)
&gt; Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv _at_ 7.9 In. Hg (Fed)
&gt;
&gt; Is there any reason why I couldn't just put the good California vacuum can 
&gt; on the Federal distributor?
