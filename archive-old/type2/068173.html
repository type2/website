Subject: Westy owners, where are your jalousie window handles?

As I said yesterday, I have bought a replacement sliding door for the '76. 
In looking it over and stripping it for painting, I notice that the handle
for the jalousie window is toward the front of the bus. I know that the
jalousie windows come in &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; versions, as you face them
from the inside.  My '73 has two right hand windows, the drivers side
crank is at the front and the passenger side is at the back.  My '76 has a
right and a left with both handles at the back of the bus.  The addition
of another left hander from the new door , and the spare right I have in
storage give me the opportunity to install any combo I want in any
position I want, but bring me to the question of how they were installed
when new.... 

As a point of minor curiousity, and because I have seen them in pretty
nearly every position, if you own a &quot;box stock&quot; Westy, where *should* they
be? If you don't, but have played with your window locations, is there a
favorite crank position?
