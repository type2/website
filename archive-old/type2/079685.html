Subject: Re: [T2] 1981 Diesel Rabbit

Chris Mills sends:

&gt;&gt;&gt; i am unfamiliar with the diesel, other than the fact that &quot;people say&quot; they
&gt;&gt;&gt; are supposed to be super durable.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The diesel fuel is more of a lubricant instead of a solvent like gasoline.
&gt; Keeps the cylinders and such happier longer.

Also count the lower RPM of a diesel into the longevity factor. Best power
in a diesel engine is under 4000rpm--with diesel you're looking for torque
more than HP (torque is good, m'kay?).

Check out http://www.yachtsurvey_dot_com to see what that guy thinks of small
diesels. (He's coming from a marine diesel point of view.) Basically, he'd
go with gas up until the time you *have* to run diesel to get the power you
need. And a Rabbit ain't that time.
 
&gt;&gt;&gt; also, my superviser at work told me (he used to own one) that you have to
&gt;&gt;&gt; plug them in during the winter months, because the feul will freeze.
&gt;&gt;&gt; something about a glow plug??
&gt; 
&gt; If there was any water in the fuel it could freeze. For some reason diesels
&gt; have more problems with water in their fuel. Most have water filters in
&gt; their fuel system.

There is a diesel antifreeze you need to put in the fuel tank in the
wintertime. Diesel also has a problem with paraffin formation.
