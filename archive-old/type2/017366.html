       What David just said didn't sound too clear to me, so I'll try to
clarify. You don't tighten all the way. You back off all the way, or
until they are not touching. Then tighten until they just barely touch
-- then one turn more. Bentley says two full turns more, but one full
turn more is apparantly enough.
