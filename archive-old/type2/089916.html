Subject: Fuel Shutoff Valve

Greetings Esteemed List,

	I found a cheap gasoline rated (with Viton seals) manual fuel
shutoff valve listed in McMaster Carr's online catalog.  If you go to
http://www.mcmaster_dot_com and search for &quot;fuel shutoff valve&quot; you will get
directly to the page.  My first guess at the best part # to order is
7910K82.  My plan is to mount this in the hole where the fuel line passes
thru the firewall with large fender washers embeded in RTV on each side and
brass hose barbs on each end (one inside the engine compartment, one behind
the engine compartment).  Hopefully this will eliminate the problem of
getting doused with gas when changing fuel filters and also make a safer
connection thru the fuel line cutting (fire causing) area where the fuel
line comes into the engine compartment.  Does anyone see any problems
inherent with this approach?  Hopefully this will solve several typical
maintenance problems as well as add some security when parked overnight in
sketchy locations...
