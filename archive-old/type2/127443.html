Dave, I've already setup/tore down this one a few times. I have found
the easiest way to just have one person on each end grab the topmost
section of the arch and use that and the bottom rings as the hand
holds, folding it in half. Then 2 more folds and it rolls up nice and
neat.

&gt; Everyone that saw it was very impressed(me too!) and wanted to know where 
&gt; I got it...I told them...good ole busdepot!&lt;grin&gt;

I got a lot of compliments at Naturalbus for the tent as well. I
really like it, and 100% glad I waited for it.
