pretty close to how I put together my 78, 2L FI engine...only real
question is why the switch to solid lifters...?? Hyd was stock and work
much better in my opinion

only other thing I did was smooth the intake/exhaust ports in the heads
(not polished)

like the way it turned out, got about 20k on it so far

&gt; I am currently putting together a 2.0 FI type IV motor for my 78' Westy.
&gt; 
&gt; I am using new MAHLE pistons (stock size and balanced), the crank and
&gt; everything that bolts to it including the bolts have been balanced. I had
&gt; the rods checked,balanced and notched per a spec for additional piston
&gt; skirt cooling. I eliminated the paper head gaskets and am using a steel one
&gt; between the jugs and the case. I have a new cam from Web cam that is .426
&gt; lift and 262 degrees duration, (224 degrees at .050). New cam gear and new
&gt; solid lifters all from WebCam meant for this cam. I have drilled out,
&gt; tapped and plugged with brass plugs the oil galley plugs behind the
&gt; flywheel. The case was inspected by machine shop who advised that it did
&gt; not need align boring, old bearings looked great.  All new bearings,
&gt; gaskets, and seals. The heads have been rebuilt with all new studs,valves,
&gt; guides and seats, new valve adjusters as well.   I am using the stock fuel
&gt; injection with new seals. (Web Cam advised this cam for use w solid lifters
&gt; and stock FI) I am also replacing the thermostat and cylinder head temp
&gt; sender. All cooling tin is accounted for and in good condition, and heat
&gt; exchangers and exhaust is in great shape.
&gt; 
&gt;      I will be assembling the beast in the coming weeks and am wondering
&gt; about all this talk of compression ratios. I plan to use a deck height
&gt; measuring tool and assume I may have to shim the barrels some to acheive
&gt; the proper compression ratio. I am shooting for 7.5:1.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Does all of this sound right to you?
&gt; 2. What is the best way to calculate compression ratio from deck height and
&gt; w/dished pistons?(whats the equation)
&gt; 3. Can you think of anything I am missing here?
&gt; 
&gt; Most of the changes/ideas here cam from advise of Bob Donalds of Boston
&gt; engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Best Regards and Thanks for the advice,
&gt;
