&gt;With all the past discussions on the &quot;hidden&quot; fuel tank, troublesome gauge
sender unit, and cracked fuel lines, has anyone tried mounting a Vanagon (or
similar - maybe even no-rust plastic!) tank under the belly and routing a
filler neck to the panel behind the right front tire (again, like the
Vanagon)?



Having had both a Bus and a Vanagon I don't think that a Vanagon tank could
be mounted to the Bus.  Maybe some sort of custom tank, but it would be far
more trouble than just replacing the fuel sender in the existing Bus tank
:-)

The top of the Vanagon tank is custom shaped to clear the Vanagon shift rod
and heater tube plus some other stuff.  Additionally, it has a bizarre and
complex overflow and venting system, with an overflow tank in each front
wheel well.  Not to mention having to cut a hole in the right dogleg area
for the fuel filler.  Given that the Vanagon has such a different suspension
and undoubtedly different positioning of the frame rails, I don't think it
could easily be done.  Of course anything is possible if you have enough
time and money, but I don't think it would be worth the trouble to do it.

Now I'll get an e-mail from someone who says that he or she put a Vanagon
tank in his or her Bus and it bolted right in :-)
