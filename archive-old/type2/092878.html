Subject: Re: [T2] PAINTING?????? WELDING?? GAHHH

I did the same with good results. My paint job is about 2-3 years old now. 
The bus lives outside on the sunny side of the house in the carport. The 
Paint is holding up well except where I have damaged it with my little 
one's toys or my toys, etc.

You can pay someone to do it for you, or spend a bit less money to learn to 
do it yourself (and buy some tools) and have a skill that you can use on 
every vehicle to need to paint in the future. The first one may not be 
perfect but with some care I think most of us will get a good driver paint 
job.

Be warned though - it is alot of work. It is hot, noisy, and dirty work. I 
would not spend the money on the best materials for the first paint job - 
just average materials. Yes the best materials are the best BUT for me the 
best materials would not have looked any better than the economy stuff.


&gt;I very recently painted my bus all outside and some inside. I think that 
&gt;you should either do it the right way, which is terribly expensive to get 
&gt;a sprayer, a good sander, paint etc etc....and you have to be very careful 
&gt;on mixing and doing the hardener and all that....or you can do it the 
&gt;cheap way.
&gt;
&gt;I decided there was no way i could afford to do it the right way so i did 
&gt;a spray can job and am very satisified.  Mind you, I don't have a show 
&gt;quality bus and it will never be a show bus nor would i ever want it to be 
&gt;a show bus....but i want to to be rust free and in good mechanical shape.
&gt;
&gt;First I took everything off and out of the bus.._dot_used a drill with a 
&gt;cirlce wire sander thing and blasted away all rust inside and 
&gt;outside....was some holes inside and used fiberglass to patch the holes, 
&gt;nothing was so big that I needed to section it.
&gt;
&gt;Primed outside, sanded primer, 2 coats of paint. Maybe a little over a 
&gt;hundred dollars in paint, primer, sand paper etc etc, rust is gone and bus 
&gt;is one color instead of a tiedye red and primer look.
&gt;
&gt;I think it took about two weeks or so. I would be hesitant about taking it 
&gt;to a &quot;professional&quot; because they are not likely to know much about buses 
&gt;and not value your bus like you do, also as you are taking everything off 
&gt;you will see things that you want to replace or fix.
&gt;
&gt;I don't expect my spray can job to last long but figure I might want it 
&gt;another color in a year or two anyways or maybe next time i'll do it the 
&gt;right way.

Ciao!
