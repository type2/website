Subject: Totally Dead 1974 Deluxe Westfalia

My Westfalia is totally dead - no power to anything (i.e. no lights,
no start, even the second hand on my clock doesn't click).  Battery
seems to be fine.  We can jump it and it will start but will not keep
running.

The worst part is that I'm a complete novice at working on cars, so
I'm not sure where to start other than checking the battery, and I
don't have anyone to help me right now (and no extra $ to spend to pay
someone to look for the problem).

The &quot;hot&quot; wire to the battery seems odd to me, as actually 3 wires
were sort of screwed together on top of the post, and one appears to
go to the other side of the engine compartment for the aux. battery,
but then is screwed to the side of the engine compartment along with
several other wires.  There is also a skinny red wire that was
attached to the post along with the thick black wire that seems to
come from the front of the vehicle.

I appreciate any suggestions.  I have the Muir book along with the
Bentley.  Thanks very much and Happy New Year.

Donna
