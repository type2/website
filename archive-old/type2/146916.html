Subject: Re: [T2] Westy gas hose connections

I changed out my hoses on my 78 and I had a new hose made for underneath 
at an rv shop.  For the bulkhead fitting, I bought a few different 
pieces from ACE because they didn't have an exact match.  If your 
fitting is still good, keep it.  For inside the cabinet, I think that's 
just a standard gas pipe, but I also reused that one as well.  I used 
gas-rated teflon paste on everything and then used soap to test for leaks.

For othe tank, make sure all your valves are working properly.  I 
actually pulled everything off, blew out all the gas for about 20 
minutes and then wire-wheeled the old paint off.  Then I used the 
rustoleum grey hammer finish paint and it looks great.  I bought a new 
little filler valve for a few bux from an rv store because mine was 
really hard to open.  I was able to reuse all my major fittings as they 
still worked fine.

that's about it... Relatively easy job as long as you don't blow 
yourself up ;)
