&gt; &gt; I think that the distinction here is between &quot;tight&quot; but movable CVs =
and
&gt; &gt; incorrectly assembled (locked) CVs,  If the CV can be moved (even =
with
&gt; &gt; some force) when new, it is not incorrectly assembled.  The use of =
dry
&gt; &gt; moly lubricants by the manufacturer can make new CVs very stiff =
until
&gt; &gt; they run a bit.  I've never received an incorrectly assembled new =
CV.
&gt;
&gt; It's a matter of articulation. If a used cv joint is assembled =
incorrectly
&gt; it will malfunction in short order.This is noted in the original post
&gt; where two used cv joints were locked up. And yes, even a new joint
&gt; should articulate, stiff as it is.
&gt;
&gt;the original post asked about new CVs, not used CVs.
&gt;
&gt;It would be very difficult even to install a incorrectly assembled
&gt;&quot;locked&quot; CV, as it wouldn't articulate to match the flanges.  Something
&gt;would break if you ran them, but I doubt that anyone could even get =
them
&gt;installed without knowing that something is very wrong..

Well, I've had a good look at the 'tight' new CV's. They are definitely =
not locked, they do move, I just need to put a screwdriver handle =
through the spline to turn them. There doesn't seem to be any build up =
of dry lubricant/packing grease so I don't think that has any affect. I =
took Dave's advice and turned them 'one ball' each way, this made no =
difference so I put them back to how they came (tough job!). My local =
supplier assured me this would not impact on the life of the CV's I was =
just surprised at the inconsistency of the 4 CV's. I was more concerned =
about the ones that move freely, they move easier that the old warn ones =
I put back in!
