&gt; The gas pedal is your basic strap hinge so look for crud build up

&gt; And yes, I've gotten a bus home with a real strap hinge, duct
&gt; tape and some foam rubber for a return spring...

I was coming off the NJ Turnpike at the Palisaides just before the GW
Bridge (if you know the area you know the hill) when my accel linkage
broke (less than a year old too!)  wasn't sure I was going to get to the
fast food joint parking lot.  

  now I'm from Baltimore and was headed on a ski trip to vermont?!?!  I
opened the rear hatch of my 78 and used a pair of vice grips to get a
lever arm. tied a piece of wire to it, ran the wire through the grab
handles over the windows to the front door handle where I tied it off,
pulled wire to go faster.  now I have an advantage of being used to hand
controls but I drove it like that for 800 miles......finished the ski trip
and then got it home!  was a &quot;bit&quot; noisy because of the hatch being
cracked but I was getting pretty comfy with the accel by the time I got
home....;8*}   

  this is NOT a reccomended prochedure but an illustration of neccesity
being a great driving force for ingenuity.
