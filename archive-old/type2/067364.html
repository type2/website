&gt; &gt; By the way, I was wondering, what is the proper way to 
spell Westphalia,
&gt; &gt; I have seen it written both ways, with a &quot;ph&quot; and with a
&gt; &gt; &quot;f&quot;...      Dallas
&gt; 

FWIW the &quot;official&quot; camper converter of VW's  spell's it 
&quot;Westfalia&quot; and I am _reasonably_ sure that the state in 
Germany is spelt the same way.
