Subject: Replacing Wheels

Hello All:

We've bounced around the subject of putting alloy wheels on baywindow busses before, and I know that many Mercedes and Audi wheels will fit on a bus, but there's something bothering me to the point that I want to ask our list before I buy any wheels.  My question is, since most late model Mercedes and Audi's have four wheel disk brakes, they don't have a huge rear wheel hub nut sticking out like our busses do.  Does this mean that I could put these wheels on my bus, but have to live without the center caps on the rear wheels, therefore seeing the hub nuts sticking out of some otherwise nice wheels???  

Thanks!
