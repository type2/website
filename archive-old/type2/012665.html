Hi Courtney,

Yours is probably a DPD system.  You can get them
working, but in my experience the compressors leak
slowly and have to be recharged yearly.  I'm looking
for a source of Freeze 12 to make this process cheaper
(R12 is costly).

Places fix them.  One place is European Cooler Air in
Dallas, Texas 972-771-3791.  They will replace the
leaky compressor with a better one for $525.

If you decide to get rid of yours, I would like to
purchase some of the parts to keep mine working.

Rob
