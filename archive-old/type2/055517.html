Subject: pop top seals?

I have a 1970 bus that was modified into a camper by Riveria Motors in 1970.  The pop top needs new seals, and I was wondering if any one knows if Westfilia seals will work for my camper.  The pop top lifts straight up, and there is a luggage rack in the front above the cab.  Any input would be great.   Thank---Jack D.
