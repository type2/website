Subject: honeymoon trip report

Hello,

Well, I made it. San Francisco to Reno to Winnimuca through Idaho to Hungry 
Horse MT (glacier NP) to Calgary to Banff through British Columbia to 
Vancouver to Seattle to Mt Hood/Bend (OR) to Lake Shasta to the grizzly 
redwood state park in northern CA and back.

3600 miles in all.
Averaged 19 MPG
broke a fan belt.
battery died, replaced.
nose mounted spare tire developed large buckle-crack along sidewall, 
replaced.
changed the oil twice along the way, desperately needs it again.
did burn up some oil along the way, not much though. (pushrod tube seals 
REALLY need to be replaced)

bus basically runs like crap now though. all kinds of odd new sounds, 
especially from the drivetrain when at high rpms. the shifter sounds like 
its vibrating against something, makes a loud rattling sound. had less and 
less power going uphill toward the end of the day.

Gene Berg oil temp sender started going off all the time, so I disconnected 
it to stop worrying. I may have done some damage when going through NV as a 
result. ran it no faster than 50-55, but still seemed pretty damn hot.

Freaked out about the heat once and ended up replacing this and that till I 
made it so it wouldnt start again. ended up 'arcing' the damn points, but 
didnt find that out till we lost nearly a whole day in the middle of noplace 
NV. oh well, I drove all night to make it up, and it never came back to 
haunt ( i think) but I think the mech that helped in the end just filed them 
down, so I should probably replace.

all in all, the bus ran really really well. I just felt bad putting on so 
many miled in such a short period of time. my little buddy needs a wash, a 
tune up, and lots and lots of assurance that we wont be drivingup and down 
the rockies anytime soon. =)

oh, and im a married man now to. weird.
