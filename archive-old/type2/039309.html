Aha!

The semi's are regulated to the rightmost two lanes here in shaky California
and are usually speed limited to 55 mph (at least, that's what the signs on
the side of the road say!). So, there's a real tense relationship between
them (the semi's) and us (the bus owners), seeing as we're going about the
same speed using the same lanes.

I'll tell 'ya, some stretches of road are downright unpleasant in the slow
lane because of the wear and tear that the semi's produce. I've also noticed
this going &quot;up&quot; the Interstate 5 (a main drag going north/south in Calif.).
The slow lane is wrought with potholes, cracks, and the such, whereas the
fast lane is smooth as a balanced crank. What a difference 10 feet to the
left makes!

&gt; &gt;I do all of my highway/freeway cruising in the lane to the left of the

&gt; &gt;1)    The semi's are usually in the &quot;slow lane&quot;, which causes that
&gt; &gt;lane to
&gt; &gt;undergo more wear and tear, thus usually a much rougher ride.

&gt; Semis in the slow lane ???????????????
&gt; You gotta be kidding.
&gt; The only thing faster than a semi here in Texas is a cop car when the
&gt; &quot;Hot Now&quot; sign is flashing at Tasty Kreme.
&gt; Then, No lane is safe !!
