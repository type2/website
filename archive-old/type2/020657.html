&gt; Your problem is not the flywheel.....it turns all the time the engine is
&gt; running.

&gt; If adjusting all the freeplay out does not correct it, you have a bad clutch
&gt; pressure plate. The travel of the diaphragm spring is not enough to release
&gt; the disc.
Karl, Troy:
Or, an almost-totally-broken clutch cable. When the cable frays down to
its last few strands, it does a lot more stretching that pulling. Also,
I've seen quite a few failed clutch discs that, when the lining wore to
the point of failure, it FOLDED over some of the rivets and actually
would not totally release (nor would it hold from slipping).
My bet is on the clutch cable.
