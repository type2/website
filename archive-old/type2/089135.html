Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone know any further info about these campers?

Hi Chris,

I see you got the pic from one of my sites. The VCT2 site you were on is a
new baywindow club that has started in may. I am the secretary and
co-webmaster.

The depicted camper is originally a bus conversion that was made by the
company of Kemperink in Almelo-Harbrinkhoek in the Netherlands. It was
designed as a small truck for light goods and big volume. The trucks were
offered thru the Volkswagen dealerships making it a VW-Kemperink
cooperation. They were also sold in Germany and the UK.
Alot of these trucks were delivered to a Dutch biscuit factory called
Bolletje. The nickname of these buses became thus Bolletje Bus. But also dry
cleaning companies embraced this type of van.

The Kemperink company received single cab buses directly from the Volkswagen
plants. They cut the car in half and placed an extra segment in the bus
making it a lot longer. Then they placed a lightweight structure over it
making it a panelvan.
You could also order a long singlecab this way, but the closed panelvan was
the big succes. Big problem was that these buses were all underpowered by a
1600cc engine. There are split and baywindow versions of this van. The
company still exists making car conversions of today.

These Bolletje Buses were later converted to campers by alot of people.
Making the original vehicle a very rare find. I can send you more detailed
info and pictures offlist if you want.

The bus on the picture was camperized in 1975 and above the driver the
sleeping area was created. Originally the roof started behind the cabin.
Also the windows were cut in the cargo area. When you look at the position
of the air intake you can see it is originally a singlecab.

For more info type the term Kemperink in a search engine and your flooded
with infos and pics.

Aircooled greetings from Holland,
