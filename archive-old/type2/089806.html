Subject: Re: [T2] painting muffler

Craig,

Good Deal.

Now give us an idea of how many miles have passed since you applied the
paint.
If the bus is sitting it don't mean much.

If in the term you mentioned you have put 20- 30 k on the unit then the
paint is well worth the effort.
If it has been siiting in the driveway--this is another story.

The heat off them pipes will cook just about any paint known to man.

Later,

Terry

got a bus muffler from bus depot a while back, along w/ 2 nos heater
boxes for the 1600... degreased them &gt;not stripped, just degreased&lt; and
then painted them all with a total of SIX CANS of rustoleum barbecue
paint, the expensive cans. six. 2 per item. let each coat dry 1/2 day,
then resprayed. then installed and idled gently for 20 minutes -
repeated next day. 
paint is still there on each item. even the muffler, tho the exhaust
pipe is a pebbly surface, and not smooth, it is still green. heater
boxes have some chips where i bumped them during engine removals, etc
but are fine otherwise. 
took a while, a lil pricey, but worked well for me. 2 years and
counting.
