Subject: what happened...update

hey volks,
just thought id update you on lizzy.   i got home from
work yesterday and took a look.  oil was at correct
mark after i added a quart yesterday, i checked valves
and they were fine, #1 exhaust was a little loose, now
in spec.   I fired it up, it turned over fine, and
started right away, i couldn't see any more smoke
coming from passenger side pipe.   there was still a
very slight pop in the exhaust but otherwise ran like
normal.   problem however is when i take off spark
plug wire to #1 there is very little, if any change in
how she runs.   im gonna pull the plug, clean it and
reinstall today, and take it for a quick spin.   no
expensive noises, a little oil drippin still.  no i
havent done a compression test yet, but i'll get to it
by the weekend and post what i get.
have a great day!
