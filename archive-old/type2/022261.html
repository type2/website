It depends the 1600,1700 #'s are typically stock displacement.  The 1641cc 
1776 are afte market build ups.  I personally have both a 1776 and a 
2110cc.  Are you thinking about pumping up a stock motor?

&gt;Okay, I admit it. I've spent the best part of my 18 years as a &quot;pro&quot;
&gt;information gatherer, working in my parents bookstore and scratching my
&gt;head through hundreds of new and exciting computer problems. But today, I'm
&gt;stumped, despite a number of books and a huge long list of VW internet
&gt;sites to rifle through with unrivaled vigour. I don't give up easily.
&gt;
&gt;I know this is something rather basic, but I was embarased to realize that
&gt;I don't know. Now, usually I see the engines in these busses refered to as
&gt;1600cc, 1700cc, etc. Seems straight forward enough. But in a number of
&gt;places I also see them refered to as 1641, 1776, whatever. Are these just
&gt;common oversizes? or is the nice round number (1700cc) an approximation?
&gt;What confused me the most is that my Haynes manual shows both numbers on it
&gt;as well.
&gt;
&gt;Help?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.
