had done the same thing to my bus, cutting open the firewall into the

passenger area.. Well, I guess that will tell you that we're not the only

lazy people out there! LOL. To me, that is not much of a mechanic, though.

That firewall is there for a reason. &gt;&gt;

IIRC, there's a VW service bulletin describing this procedure... ?-)
(Trivia note: Same thing on some old Buick Skylarks...With the V8,
the inner fender needed a circle cut out to r'n'r the rearmost 
sparkplugs...GM sent out sheet metal circles to fill in the cutouts.)
