Volks,
  A huge thanks to &quot;Karl&quot; _at_
                 &lt;aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;
For the slider roof cables ..... a hard to find item
and one I had about given up on... 
I would like to offer up to anyone in the PACNW a middle seat and
the rear bench seat from my 74... both are in good condition and
would only require you bolting them down.... the middle seat
is for two.
  Thanks again!
