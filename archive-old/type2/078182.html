Subject: Relay power to coil?

When I installed driving lights on my '73 bus recently, I ran power directly
from the battery to the light relay at the front of the bus.  In doing so, I
started thinking about some other accessories I run from existing wiring
that might do better running directly from the battery through a relay
energized when the coil is hot.  In my case, I also run the electric fuel
pump and an engine hour meter from the hot side of the coil.

So, my question is, would it make sense to run power directly from the
battery to a relay, which when energized by the ignition wire to the coil
would provide power to the coil, fuel pump and hour meter?  The power should
be full voltage for the coil, not having to go all the way to the front of
the bus and back.

Opinions welcome.

Also, has anyone done any other wiring cleanup in the engine compartment of
their bus?  I remember a picture of Bob Hoover's bus once and he had done
additional wiring cleanups into terminal blocks, etc.

Thanks,
Dean
