Subject: Re: [T2] Bay Window Westy interior into a split window?

Sorry, That was a really VAGUE MISLEADING answer I
sent (I realized that after I read it on-list) To
clarify, the Split window interior is wider than the
bay, the rear seat is longer from side to side)
However, the interior as a whole is LONGER front to
back in a the Bay window than in a split...

Peace, John Baker
