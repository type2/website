&gt;Bentley advises .008 (.20 mm)  for exhaust valves on a 74 1800cc. Is
&gt;that what y'all do? I haven't noticed this figure in the lists or
&gt;archives, so I thought I'd ask.
&gt;
&gt;And honestly, I'm not trying to start a fight here...
&gt;


Off the top of my head I'll stick in that I feel the .008 rec is for sodium
filled valves, I've always wondered that a bit.  Superior in heat transfer
but apparently expanded more?  Anyway a couple things to consider, the
chances of sodium exhausts still residing in your heads in your bus at this
point in its life are rather remote.  Furthermore, a lot probably always ran
at the .006 clearance.  Myself, I favor a little looser clearance on the
exhausts by nature, and since this is so damn subjective anyway as to how
worn your feelers, adjusting screws, valve tips, etc. are, and then the pure
subjectiveness of the measuring technique itself, I wouldn't sweat the
difference so much.  I like my exhausts to pass a .006 &quot;relatively&quot; easily,
I would probably do the same if I had sodium filled valves.  I like my
intakes to be a &quot;snug&quot; .006.  Do whatever you feel is correct, as long as
you watch them carefully and mentally note any variation, you'll probably be
OK.  If you want to rid yourself of lifter noise, retrofit hydraulics on
your next rebuild, or maybe right now.....

(although there is good evidence that the occasional engine has left VWoC
rebuilders with hydraulics running just fine on solid profile cams, that one
may cause arguements.  I personally can garantee no metal parts will hit
because of such a change assuming pushrods, rocker spacers, etc match, but
beyond that I simply note the possibilities, the ramp angles on the cam, may
not be &quot;ideally&quot; matched for hydraulics, and new lifters on an old cam (over
50k or so) are probably wasted anyway)

YMMV
