Subject: First time points adjustment...

Hey, I'm trying to tune up my bus for the first time, having no previous experience or knowledge.  I'm using Mr. Muir's idiot's guide.  So I get to the points adjustment, and after I figure out what's what, where the points are and how far they need to be, I reassemble the distributor, and everything seemed fine.  But now it's not starting.  It turns over, but it doesn't fire up.  

I checked all of the wires, spark plugs, rotors, caps, everything is where it should be, and the points are adjusted .016&quot; from the lobes.  Does any one have any suggestions what this could be.  I apologize for my lack of knowledge, but I'm just learning.  Thanks for you're responses in advance.

-Rob
