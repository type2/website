Subject: [T2] One more with starting problems

hey...the starter and battery seem to be fine on my bus, the problem is the
engine has resistance when the cylinder compresses. if I turn the engine by
the flywheel nut, its fine until the upstroke on any cylinder, and I can
hear a 'squish' sound when it reaches the top of the stroke but then it
kinda hangs there..now if I hold it there or slack off just a bit, the
pressure goes away enough to turn the engine to the next upstroke...and the
process starts all over...and every once in a while it will start right up
and purrs...no valve clatter, no hesitation, seems to be timed
perfect....what am I missing? is it possible the valves are TOO tight, what
would cause that binding effect? I looked in chilton's and it talks about
hydrostatic lock, wuzzat? I'm lost, any ideas?
thanks
-Rich
