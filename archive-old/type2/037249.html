Ok my bus is going in the body shop really soon and i have a question. I am 
getting the nose replaced on it what would be a good price to get this done 
my bus is a 71. With all this talk about getting rust fixed around the 
windsheild fixed for around 1000. I don't know what a good price would be for 
getting the nose fixed so if anyone that has experience doing this please 
drop me a line. Thanks
