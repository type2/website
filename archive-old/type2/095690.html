Subject: 77 bus disc brake bleeding

Volks,
Just searched the archives and could not find the answer i'm looking for. 
The disc brakes have 2 bleeder valves. Do i bleed them both? just the top? 
the top first?
Aslo, the sears vaccuum hand pump i bought says i should start with the 
bleeder valve closest to the master cyl (left front), but the idiot book 
says start with the one furthest from the master cyl (Right Rear). Which is 
correct?
Thanks,
Jeremy
