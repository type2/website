Subject: re: [T2] Is this happening to you?

Part of my reason to look for a Vanagon camper (80-83) is because
of this, I got to feeling harassed.  It seemed every town we'd drive
through we became the hippy parade, with everyone looking and 
pointing and giving peace signs.  At first it felt like a real mission -
spreading the peace, but after a guy in El Paso gave us a peace
sign on the highway while pretending to toke something laughing
with his head up and down I got to feeling like a clown.  This may 
be because I'm only a few years older than my bus, but I felt 
gawked at..  It was then that I started really missing being 
inconspicuous.
