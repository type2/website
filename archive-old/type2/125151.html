Subject: Re: [T2] Seat Questions

&gt; What do I use to attach the seat stand mats?  Has anyone used other
materials?

The ones in my bus seemed to have been held with glue. I would use Spray
Adhesive myself. They also have a thin layer of  foam under them.

&gt; Also within the seat stands is a large opening.  I was wondering if there
were any  coverings that are supposed to cover this area.  Or is this just
large open storage space?

I have an akward space between my seats as well. But I believe the PO
removed the 2/3rds seat that used to be their in an attempt to make a
WalkThrough. Do you have seatbelts for the middle seat up their like I do?
Maybe your bus's PO converted from bench style seats too. Or I've HEARD
Westfalia's have a removable middle seat. Is yours a Westie (camper
conversion)?

Hope it helps
Chris
