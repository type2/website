It is the Omaha VW Club that is having their show on June 12th at Westroads
in Omaha.  The Lincoln Nebraska club(Our brothers) is the club that is going
on the Black Hill Cruise.  We both picked our dates at the same time by
mistake but maybe next year we can do things together but on different
dates.

&gt; &lt;&lt; Interesting that the Volkswagen Club of Nebraska would be heading to
Mt.
&gt;  Rushmore the same day as their show! &gt;&gt;
There are actually 3 events (semi-local) on that weekend.  The Rushmore date
was set in January before the others or at least before I new the dates of
the others.
