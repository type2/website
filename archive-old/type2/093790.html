Subject: Re: [T2] Pop top order fiasco

I just got my first order from busdepot.  Very nice until i realized one 
item wasnt in there.  A gauge pod that i was told was in stock.  I got 
no invoice in the package saying it wasnt shipped.  Finally after 2 
emails asking if it was a mispack or arriving separate,  i get the note 
that oh.. that item is NLA and would i like the underdash version 
instead.  Not happy...Put me a week behind schedule.

&gt; big snip for the robot,,,,

&gt;   I was told that they were sold out of the grey, and it
&gt; would take 2 to 3 weeks to get it to me, so I asked to switch to tan, 
&gt; and I
&gt; was told that they just sold out today... had I been told yesterday that
&gt; they did NOT in fact have enough grey to cover my order I would have
&gt; switched to the tan then... So now I'm told they have plenty of the 
&gt; bright
&gt; yellow in stock... or I can pay 3 day shipping from CA to have them drop
&gt; shipped from their supplier... which is just way too much money for me 
&gt; to
&gt; pay right now...
