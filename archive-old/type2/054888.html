Subject: Re: buying a replacement jack....

There's a company called Lincoln, makes a floor jack, honest 2 ton, 2 feet 
long, lifts 24&quot;... it's not cheap, either, but it's worth it's weight in 
gold...I put it under my back seat, and it has saved my life numerous 
times...  And it's good enough to drop an engine with.

Hugs,
Susanne
