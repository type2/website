&gt; What kind of glue do I want to use for repairing light lenses for
&gt; marker, signal, and brake lights?  Glue packages sometimes indicate
what
&gt; kinds of plastic for which they are suitable for; but identifying
these
&gt; lenses as plastic is as far as my knowledge of bonded polymers goes.
&gt; They are plastic, right?  :  )

  You might want to check on the price of a replacement lens or ask
for a used on from the list, the price of the replacement may be less
than the cost of the right glue. I have a good set for a '73-'79, what
do you need.
