Subject: Re: [T2] Riviera tops

&gt; Does anyone know if Riviera tops can be retrofitted with Westy tops?  I have
&gt; an 80 Riviera, and the top is cracking badly.  I was hoping the hole in the
&gt; roof would be the same size, since the Riviera vans came from the factory
&gt; with the hole already in them.  Thanks, Nik

I know that a late Westfalia (ie. 79) hole was wider &amp; deeper so that
basically the entire roof of the bus was cut out to the drip rails.  My 72
Riviera has a hole cut towards the front &amp; it does not run completely to the
rear of the bus, the bed was built basically on the roof.  I cannot comment
on the 80 but maybe this will start some answer stimulation.
