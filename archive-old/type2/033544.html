Subject: Re: propane stove

I'm sure others will have advice on this, but here's my experience:

I was really nervous at first with mine. I had these nightmare visions
of a rock kicking up a spark from the highway and exploding my LPG tank
and blowing me to kingdom come. I got over it. :-)

You can go to RV places that dispense the propane and they can do a
pressure test of the tank to check it for integrity. I didn't do this,
since the PO said the stove *had* been used, just not by her (it made
her too nervous). I live life on the edge. ;-)

If it's leaking, you'll smell it when you open the valve to let the gas
from the tank go to the stove. That's why they make the gas smell like
it does. And it won't cause a fire without a spark. If you want to test
the connections: Make sure there's no spark or flame around for, like,
50 feet. Make sure the burners on the stove are turned OFF. Turn on the
main valve at the tank. You'll smell gas if there's a leak. YOU SHOULD
NORMALLY NOT SMELL GAS AT ANY TIME -- IF YOU DO, SHUT OFF THAT VALVE.
You can spray soapy water or household cleaner (my father likes 409)
around the joints to check for leaks -- it'll bubble if there are any
leaks. 

Of course, if there's no propane in the tank none of this will work! And
that is a possibility if it's been that long since anyone's used it --
it may have just run out and they never refilled it.
