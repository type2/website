X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

There seems to be a lot of people on this list that have bad rusted out
beams on there buses. Of course most are on the east coast or mid west. Over
here on the west coast, we have salvage yards full of Buses with good solid
beams in them. Its too bad we could not find a way to ship them at a
reasonable cost. Any Idea how much a stripped beam weighs? What would coast
to coast shipping cost? I do not mind going to the yards, get them, stipping
them and sending them off, but I know cost is an important factor in the
whole thing.
