I am considering getting a welder for x-mas and would like to know what
the best kind to get is.  I have no real experiance with one and would 
probably not use it all that often.  Anyone outthere buy one lately and
like it (or hate it).  Any good brands to look for?  
Initial cost plus cost to maintain the welder would be interesting to me.
So what kind of welder should I buy to work on my Bus (there, bus stuff 
included) as well as other things?
Also saftey is pretty important as well as ease of opperation.
