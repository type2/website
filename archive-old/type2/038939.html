&gt;I've got a similar problem with my '72 bus.
&gt;The guy I bought it from told me that he disconnected the vacuum hose
&gt;to the Brake vacuum booster, but he didn't tell me where to look for it.
&gt;I checked the boost at the brake master cylinder and all the way under
&gt;the bus, but I can't find WHERE it plugs in to the engine.
&gt;This bus has a single carburetor. Does anyone have a photo or a sketch
&gt;of the connection at the engine?

On a stock 72 engine, the connection goes through the front (Front Is
Front) engine tin on the lower right (passenger) side.  My guess is that
you'll find an open, 1/2&quot; diameter hole in this area.  With an aftermarket
carb, there's no telling.  The PO might have simply disconnected it because
there was no place for it on the manifold.  If that's true, you might have
to drill and tap a port for it yourself.  The area it will need to attach
to is the plenum beneath the carb, before it goes off into the four pipes.
Check this area for plugged ports - maybe you'll get lucky.
