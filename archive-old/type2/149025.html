Subject: Distributor-coil conundrum

Hi Folks,

I thought this was going to be easy, but it seems I'm missing some 
basic knowledge about the way a distributor and coil work.  So now I've 
got myself in a mess.

Situation: 1970 bus with Mexi 1600DP.  I was running a 009 with 
CompuFire.  Finished a major tune-up last night, and the bus ran fine.  
This morning I tried to switch in an SVDA distributor.  Got it all 
hooked up fine.  Went to do a static timing before starting, and this 
is where I had trouble.  I usually listen for the little &quot;click&quot; rather 
than use a light, but I didn't hear it.  So I hooked up the light.  I'm 
getting 12v constant from the negative side of the coil.  That can't be 
right.  I disconnected the green wire from the SVDA and the main coil 
wire to the distributor; still 12v.

You'd think that after 15 years with this bus I'd be able to understand 
what's happening here, but there you go.  I feel like an idiot, and for 
once Muir's idiot guide and the Bentley are not helping.  I don't want 
to go further (or return to the 009) before I get some advice.

Care to set me straight?

Thanks,
Jerry
