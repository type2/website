Subject: Tent

I got an unsolicited catalog today from &quot;Sportsmans Guide&quot; which had an
interesting tent designed to attach to the back of a truck or van or serve
free standing. It's about 10' square with an 8' center and an alcove that
attaches to the rear of your vehicle. Supposedly on sale at $150 which sounds
about right for a tent of that size. Beats the hell out of the prices I see
for Westy tents on the 'net.

The catalog number is 800-888-3006. I have no experience with these folks.
