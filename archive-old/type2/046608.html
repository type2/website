&gt; I'm not sure that this will be a big help, but you be the judge.  My 70 Bus
&gt; is Savannah Beige (L620) and Cloud White (L581).

Wow, &quot;Cloud White&quot; that's new one I guess. Probably one of those white's
that was only available in combination with another colour.

I would like to have all the codes on the metal plate. I keep a database
of the codes so I can compare them and figure out any unknown codes. Now
I am wondering: what colour-code is mentioned on the m-plate to point
out &quot;Cloud White&quot;?
