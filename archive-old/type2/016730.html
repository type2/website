Subject: BBB3 &amp; POMONA REPORT

Just want to say that IT WAS COLD in Pomona!!  But Ronnie &amp; Terry were
there doing their BBB3 thing!!! They even had a splitty with all the
details printed on the side about BBB3!! Ronnie spotted a way kool set
of bucket seats for Bessie--after 2 seconds of bargaining i bought both
of them for $10!!! they are in perfect shape!!  I also sold the interior
panels for a double cab to Rex Eastman for $$!!! complete.--I think Rex
got a deal!! not all of them were original---but nice!! Best find was an
early VW christmas ornament--3 early VW bud vases--there was a 1963 VW
westy SO33, i think???-with a FLIP seat!! that went unsold at $2500--i
know i would have bought it --if i had the room!!
BBN#3--will be the place to be in 1999!!! jan 22.23.24--Lake
Havasu---by--
--LBB a new NEATO chapter!!
OCTO  was also out in force at Pomona--their next show is in Feb 1999
A set of heart-shape tail lights DID NOT make it thru the night in the
cars for sale area!!
Lots of sticky fingers around--you really have to watch it!!
This time the prices on the VWs for sale were within reason--it did rain
fri-night &amp; sat-night--but the days were clear!!   Magoo &amp; I are always
there --right on Bus Row-
road #33--come and visit!!  uncle jerry
PS Ronnie says Bessie the hippy bus will make her debut at BBB3 !!!!!
BBB#3--&lt;ronnie_at_ctaz_dot_com&gt;---ask him if Bessie needs parts?? and tell him
uncle jerry sent me---Vintage VW??---drive-um!!
