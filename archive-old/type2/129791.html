&gt; &gt;&gt;I'm confused as to why the rust is an issue.
&gt;  I have ALWAYS just let the pad rub the rust off.

Rust is normal &lt;shrug&gt;. When you get it running see how the brakes work, if 
after a few stops you are not happy with them then either turn or replace 
the rotors.
Don't sweat the little stuff....get it running is what you need to do.
