I am back on my recurring rough idle, heisitaion problem.  I had changed the
points &amp; condenser about two weeks ago &amp; the van ran great.  Went up to
central Oregon &amp; back. All of a sudden the cutting out, rough idle &amp;
heisitaion came back.  I really do not want to buy another set of points &amp;
condenser.  I checked &amp; after 2 weeks there is already some sign of burning
on the points.  Is this normal?  If you look at some of my old posts you
will see I have replaced or tested almost everything.  I am getting a little
discouraged here.  Camping season is upon us &amp; I am spending most of the
time working on my van instead of driving it.  Any ideas?  Would I get 2 bad
condensers in a row?  Would installing a Pertronix help?
