Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel filter woes

Oddly enough, that is good news. I have heard that access doors came stock
on some bay models (Brazil? S. Africa? Other?). Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?

With the hole, the job is a snap. And, the filler neck is not an expensive
part. CIP1 has them, and they ship quick (at least here on the West
Coast).
