Hey again
    Anybody have a use for a Bosch GR17X generator? It supposedly fits buses 
from midyear 69 thru 71. Here's the story- I ordered this unit for my bus 
when my generator died. Had it half installed when we realized that it was 
the wrong unit. (I have an early 69 bus, I ended up getting a GR15X) So it 
has been partially installed but never ran. Engine was still out when we 
realized it was wrong. 
     It would be more hassle than it's worth to return this thing, and face a 
restock charge. Make me a reasonable  offer- it's useless to me. Plus 
shipping of course.
    Email me if interested
