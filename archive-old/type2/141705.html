Subject: Re: Goodbye type2... 79 Westy for sale

Mike:

Sorry to hear that you are giving up on your bus.  I can relate.  I 
also have a '79 CA Westy and have had beaucoup head problems ever since 
installing an AVP rebuild after the original heads crapped at 147 k 
miles.

I noticed from your ad that you installed AVP heads back in 2002.  I'm 
guessing that your problem is with the AVP heads.  I've pissed through 
three sets of them before I finally realized that the quality of AVP 
heads leaves a lot to be desired.  I've had no problem with the lower 
end of the engine, but their heads are lousy.

I'm now running new AMC heads with stainless valves from Boston Engine. 
  So far, so good, but I'm still crossing my fingers.. and toes.. and 
anything else that I can think of.

Anyway, I hope you find a good owner for your bus.

Tim
'79 Westy
