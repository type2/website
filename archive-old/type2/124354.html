Subject: Re: [T2] Generator and fan from a SP engine in Doghouse
  shroud??

&gt; Hello List,
&gt;
&gt; Quick question: Will the generator, generator stand,
&gt; and fan from a 1600cc SP engine work with a 1600cc DP
&gt; dog house fan shroud? I am getting a rebuilt 1600cc DP
&gt; engine to put in my 68 bus. I wanted to use the
&gt; generator, stand, and fan from the old SP engine with
&gt; a set of dog house tin and shroud, but I wanted to
&gt; make sure they were compatable with each other.Is
&gt; there anything I should be aware of when doing this?
&gt; Any suggestions?

I converted my 70 bus to doghouse recently. Used original 70 generator and
stand and tin at end of generator. Fan housing and wide fan and doghouse
tin were from a later type I. If the DP engine is a Type I you will need a
larger/bus tin piece at the front (flywheel side) to fit the bus body.
