Subject: Re: servo stuff

&gt;Does anyone have a source for brake servos? I looked in my JCW,
&gt;RMMW, MOFOCO catalogs and did not see them listed. HMMMmmmmmmm

Chip,

Try your foreign FLAPS.  A good foreign place should be able to track one
down for you.  They aren't cheap, though--I paid (you're sitting down,
right?) $220 or so last year for one for my '71.  I think it came with a 1
year warranty from the manufacturer (ATE?).  At this price many people
choose to hunt a used one down ($50-$75 try Busboys or local junkyard).  As
far as I know, nobody rebuilds VW gasoline engine brake power
boosters/servos.  I've seen ads in Hemmings Motor News for a company that
rebuilds servos for old American cars, though. 

Good luck,

Ron
