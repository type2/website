&gt; It looks like some kind of map light that you stick someplace, I 
&gt; thought 
&gt; maybe that wierd hole under the glovebox, but it doesnt fit.
&gt; any ideas?

Based on pic 3 it looks like a map light you put in a cigarette lighgter
plug.  My 68 doesn't have a 12v outlet for a cigarette lighter.  I doubt
it's a Bay Bus part, unless it's a late Bay Bus part.
