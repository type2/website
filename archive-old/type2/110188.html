Subject: Re: [T2] My Kid's New 74 Bus

Somewhat unrelated story about fuel filters.
Someone removed the fuel filter from my ugly 68 beetle to be a malicious 
pr#_at_k and when I moved it for the street sweeping day I smelled gas aplenty.
I found the problem right away but if I had been going to work I would have 
been toast.
I never found out who tried to kill my car with me in it but they are still 
out there and many others like them.
Protect yourself from the malicious pr#_at_ks of the world and when you lock up 
your Bus at night lock your engine hatch.
Unlock it in the morning and check your oil.
My 2c worth.
