Subject: Distributors

Hi Volks, 

Matt here,

I have 2 distributors that I am considering using on my type I 1776, Dual
Kadron, 68 Westy. Oh yeah, Engle 110 cam.

I looked the carbs up on the web site and found that they are

An 050

And 

a 231 173 007 which is a 1973 1700cc auto trans.

I also have an 009.

I would like to get some opinions on which to use on the type I 1776 (above)
in my Westy.

Looking forward to your responses.

Matt
