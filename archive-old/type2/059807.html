    Also I don't want to slam the bus, but have seen some that have been 
lowered a little and like the look. Is the torsion bar front end like 
the Bug and require adjusters or splined like the type III?

It's a torsion bar front end like the Beetle with a pack of torsion leaves
(well, two packs). It can be easily lowered in 3 ways (actually, compared
to other suspensions, this is a PITA to adjust ride height):

1. Fit an adjuster in the top beam (good welding needed).
2. Cut 'n' turn (not recommended, basically because you may as well weld in
an adjuster and get the adjustability).
3. Dropped spindles (said to give better ride/travel, etc.)

I'd go for option 1 or 2, alternatively you could buy a beam with the
adjsuters already fitted, but there are problems relating to getting exactly
the right width beam (you have to pack it if it's too wide, if it's too 
narrow you're stuck). If it's a gentle lowering (eg. 3&quot;), then ride and
suspension geometry are uncompromised and you can use stock tyres, wheels,
shock absorbers, etc.

I fitted an adjuster to my camper, its lowered about 3&quot; and it looks 
completely level now, quite subtle, just about noticeable (if you saw it
before). Since it's level, not nose-up, the non-VW world just think it's
okay and don't give you a second glance.

One day I'll slam it to the max. on the adjuster, fit lower profile tyres
on 15&quot; tri-spoke wheels, then people will look and stare. But not yet.

PS If you need any advice/tips on the job, pmail me and I'll give you some
detailed advice. I believe there is a good article in the library, but my
article has a few noteworthy points to add to this.

Are you planning to lower the rear as well?
