Subject: RE: [T2] FS: 78 Bay Parts

Bob,

It is an auto tranny, but the tranny and linkage have already been spoken
for.

I'm really trying to make a trailer out of it at some point, so I wont be
cutting it up.

But the entire interior is there, and the under carriage steering etc.  

Dave

&gt; If you have anything that you'd like from it, I'll be able to bring the
&gt; parts to JBB.

is it an auto tranny bus??

&gt; Some of whats there:
&gt;
&gt; Lots more. Just ask.

are you cutting it up??

I need a right rear clip seam to seam &amp; roofline down??

how about a decent sliding door??
or at least the parts off it.

you need anything for a 78 could swap from my parts stash.

Bob
