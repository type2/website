One can also install adjustable air shocks to help the rear end. It
comes in handy in leveling your bus when hauling varying loads.

Below, I've copied and pasted an email John Baker sent me concerning air
shocks.

&quot;I just replaced the rear shocks on my 71 with adjustable air shocks
from NAPA auto parts. The part number is #MA758. They are regular stock
items. The biggest issue is that you are going to have to get longer
mounting bolts for the top of the shocks, you stock ones are too short.
BTW, these bolts are hard to find, but I ordered mine from mdmetric_dot_com
you need to get 12mm bolts with a 1.50 thread pitch that are 110 mm
long, other than these bolts, mine bolted on fine and I am very happy
with the results after about 6 months of driving on them.&quot;

Blake, Phil, and the List:

The rear height can be adjusted via the spring plate on the torsion bar.
The
Bentley manual chapter 6, 10.3 and 10.2 outlines the procedure. It's not
really that difficult. I pegged it on the first try by following the
instructions to the letter. Get the bubble protractor at sears or harbor
freight, and don't believe that the brake lines have to be disconnected;
I
found that there was a slot cut out in the spring plate that allowed its
removal without opening the hydraulic system. Buy new bushings to
install,
they're cheap. Be sure to use talc and not petroleum based lubricants.
Unless it is a broken spring, it can be adjusted out.

&gt; &gt; Im looking at a 70 bus, it looks pretty good, engine rebuilt not too
&gt; &gt; long ago except the front end sits higher than the back end (looks
like
&gt; &gt; its going to pop a wheelie-not that bad but you get the idea). Is
this
&gt; &gt; a major problem, what might this be?
&gt;
&gt; My 70 of which I am the original owner has always been a little
&gt; high in the
&gt; front - don't know why.
