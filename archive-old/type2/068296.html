Subject: Re: Aux. Battery inst. in '72??

&gt;I'm new to the list so forgive me if this information has already been
&gt;given!!  I've seen the archives on putting an auxillary battery in a
&gt;Vanagon but what about an earlier breadloaf Westy??  It seems like there is
&gt;such a nice place for it on the left side of the engine compartment.  Would
&gt;it be as simple as hooking it in-line to the existing battery with a
&gt;shutoff so as not to drain the starting battery.  I'mm rambling but I
&gt;really want to do this so I don't keep running down the main batt. !!
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
 

 Yes, it's that simple but maybe you should tell us why your battery
is being run down.

 It's kind of necessary to know, to determine what kind of &quot;shut-off&quot;
switch.

 It may even be that this will not cure your problem.

 So come clean and reveal all. You got a 200 amp stereo in there?
