Subject: timing advance problem-throttle pos. or stuck distr weights?

Tracking down sluggishness-
When I noticed the timing would not advance beyond 28, I found the hose
to the distr canister on the 75 cracked and fixing that let the timing
advance to 43-45.
Now it has this oddity of not coming down to idle/7.5 deg vor TDC after
revving it up- (or taking a long time) and it is not a stuck gas cable-
yanking the small vac hose to the throttle positioner (and plugging the
leak) lets the rpms drop- what gives- and will running it on the highway
cause too high an advance?  I could drop the timing, and it will drop
the rpm's, but then later, it can/will drop to retarded and hardly
idle.  We have noticed no pinging- in fact it is sluggish (no
hesitation, just has poor accel. and must go up a hill a gear lower.  No
hesitation like with bad gas flow.  The compr on this recent rebuild
(about 4K) has a problem on #3 (1=155, 2=135, 3=110, 4=135, but that
should not be enough to cause the sluggishness?  Adding oil for a wet
test boosted #3 only 5 lb, about 15 on the others.  Hydr. lifter valves
are adjusted fine.
