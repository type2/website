Subject: Re: [T2] Installing a 1978 2.0 into a 74 westy

----- Original Message ----- John said
&gt; I put a 2.0 into a 72 that the PO also had a 1600 in. I didn't fool
&gt; with any of the things discussed in archives. All I had to do was
&gt; clearance the bellhousing for the bigger flywheel and switch to an A/T
&gt; starter.

That is strange John

The automatic starter,,, SR17 ,, will NOT mate with the &quot;bigger&quot; flywheel
&lt;228mm&gt;
The input shaft needs to be shorter for a 1600cc,, than a 2.0 liter,, so I would
have thought that would need to be changed back as well....

Can you clarify what parts were actually used in this conversion?


The 1972 Trans is supposed to be a 002.  this bellhousing accepts 215mm and
smaller flywheels.. 200mm , 210mm and 215mm flywheels will work with the SR17
starter &lt;A/T&gt; .. or the SR15 &lt;M/T&gt;

The later model 091 trans uses a deeper starter ,, the SR87.. which only mates
with the 228mm flywheel.. and 091 bellhousing

you can not put a SR87 starter in a 002 bellhousing
I have never tried to clearance for a 228mm flywheel in a 002 bellhousing, but
the starter is tooo long and won't fit the 002 bellhousing even if you did get
the 228mm flywheel in .... afaik
