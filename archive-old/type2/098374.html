&gt; or the other way around?

The bolt pattern on all type 4 engine heads was the same from '72 thru
'78, so you can match the earlier heater boxes to your heads without
changing the studs.  At the same time, if you have any studs that are less
than pristine, now is definitely the time to change them.

&gt; The other thing I wanted to know is.... does ir matter which heat
&gt; exchangers I use F.I. ,carb , 1700, 1800, I have an engine from '76
&gt; Carb. which is more c.c. than either one of the 72-74.

The heater boxes will interchange without problems between the '72-74 dual
carb and '75-78 fuel injection engines.
