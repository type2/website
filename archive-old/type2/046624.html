&gt; Volks,
&gt;    My bus (79) has a rear defogger window and I was stupid and was trying to
&gt;  remove old stickers and I scraped a wire (I guess)that goes from one side 
to
&gt;  the other, and I was wondering if anybody knew a fix for this problem.

Hi Brad,

A good auto shop will sale a very little bottle of paint with a brush in the 
cap - a bit like a touch-up paint bottle but smaller.
This is quite expensive because the paint is SILVER and you use it to paint 
over breaks in the rear screen demister.

If you can't get any in your local auto parts store then try an electronics 
shop as they sale similar paint for repairing printed circuit boards.

Good luck
