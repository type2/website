Scott teased:
&gt;&gt; All the discussion about split E-brake handles puts me in mind of how i
set my bus up for &quot;set speed'  or throttle hold&quot; I think i will try and let
everyone figure out how i did it.  No additional equipment needed. &lt;&lt;

Well, the way I used to achieve &quot;cruise control&quot; in my '73 181 was to put a
brick on the gas pedal.  Would that be considered additional equipment?  =)
