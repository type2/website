Subject: Re: [T2] Aurora Super Mag Plus wires

&gt; &gt; Seems like a lot of work just to replace some spark plug wires...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think I'll stick with the correct Bosch ones until I hear a real
&gt; &gt; killer benefit to those &quot;Super Mag&quot; wires.
&gt;
&gt; The reason I went with them was my new CDI ignition ... I was worried
&gt; about radio noise because of the non-resistor rotor, and these wires
&gt; were described as the ones to use to suppress that noise.

There is a better reason. The oem wires are not insulated enough for CDI
with the plug gap open. You can get arcing from the wires to the tin and
case.
When I ran a cdi I never opened the plug gaps. Doing so increases the
spark voltage because it takes more V to jump the bigger gap.

Do you have a modified rotor with the resistor jumped out? The resistor
will break down in time with the cdi running. You can modify it yourself
or I think Aircooled sells them already done.
