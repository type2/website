&gt; Wait, you can pass a minivan with your bus?  :-)

Not only can I not pass a minivan. On the highway Im surprised when I pass
anything.
I even got passed by a house once.
Yes, a house, on 2 huge trailers with 2 small trucks as chase vehicles.

I was going uphill and a state trooper came alongside...I thought he was
gonna stop me but he just kept walking... :-)
