I posted a while ago about a trip I was going on, well now I am back minus
my bus it is in Reims in france.
This is what happenned the bus was eating fan belt's like no tomorrow as
there was wear between the pulleys and because I was on a busy motorway I
had to drive 10k to a service station to get off the motorway anyway she was
smoking when I got there and I turned the key off and it was still running,
got it recovered to a VW main dealer in Reims and they said the engine was
Kaput no compression does anyone know what sort of damage I have done or are
there any list member's in northern France who could help me get it to
Calais and on to the boat so the AA could recover it to my home address
because AA Europe doe's not cover France.
And to make the best of this I done 4000 mile's all through France, Italy
and Greece with no problems, I only had 200 mile's to go to Calais she did
all the Alps the lot.
Anyway it was quite a trip I saw some really nice thing's.
Cheer's Banny.
