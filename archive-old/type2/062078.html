Jeffery Carver asks:

&gt;Lisa -
&gt;How did you peel the vinyl off?  Mine is shredding into small pieces. 

I guess I was lucky. The van had been sitting closed for 6 to 8 months
and the vinyl was just hanging off. It peeled easily. Heat would 
probably be a better idea than what I used to get the reluctant
pieces off. I used a paintbrush and Bestine rubber cement thinner and
would paint the thinner on the leading edge of a part that was still
glued on. Peel until it stops, then paint on more Bestine. Bestine
is available at art supply stores. I tried paint thinner, acetone, and
alcohol but none of these would dissolve the adhesive. I would try
heat first, if it doesn't work, go with the Bestine.
