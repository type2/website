X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL


Hello All,
  I am needing some help. I found an automatic trans for another listee and
I need to ship it to him. The problem is that the trans and converter weigh
175lbs with no box or wrapping, just bare trans. I know this has been
discused before, but I don't really remember qhat was said. I searched the
library (type2_dot_com) and the archives but I did not find much. It will be
going from Tacoma Wa. to Colorado. I need sugestions. UPS has a limit of
150lbs, US post office is around the same. Anyone going to Colorado? I think
money saved is more important than time. Please help.
