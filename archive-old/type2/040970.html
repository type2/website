Subject: Re: Converting Rear Brakes to Disc Brakes

&gt; The better investment would be to add
&gt; 73 and up front brakes to your 71, they are a little bigger.

No....they are not &quot;bigger&quot;. The pads are the same size. They are thicker.
This will give you more miles between pad changes. You can use the early
71-72 pads in a 73 up, you would not like the mileage on a set.
