Subject: VW Vacuum Ho$e

Hi folks,

I dropped by my local VW dealer yesterday and innocently asked for a bit of
braided vacuum hose.  I learned that the price recently increased from
$11.95/meter to $19.95/meter!!!  I didn't find out why the increase, but I
did ask how vacuum hose could be so expensive to begin with.  The
sympathetic parts manager told me that the VW braided vacuum line (the only
type they carry) is rated for both gas and diesel engines.  Apparently the
rubber is formulated to resist deteriorating effects of diesel fuel. 

I've been through this sort of thing before with the large ID brake booster
braided wire reinforced vacuum hose (that was selling for some godawful
price/meter), for which I ended up substituting with Gates wire reinforced
heater hose successfully.  

It's too bad that VW doesn't buy back used parts at commesurate prices--I
could part out my bus, sell it to VWoA and retire a millionaire!
