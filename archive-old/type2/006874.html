Biagio,

Thank you very much for your kind words. The Wayback and our web site was,
and still is, a labor of love. She is in good loving hands in Portland (and
much better off in cooler climes). She was part of our lives for 8 years. It
was a sad moment to see her leave, but circumstances left us little choice.
No regrets and great memories! 

Again thanks to all of you on this list. It has been a grand experience!

Scott
