Sounds like preignition, a.k.a. detonation/knocking/pinging.  Don't let
your bus make this noise as it will destroy your engine in short order.
First thing I would try is running higher octane petrol.  If the problem
goes away, then you just learned something new about your engine - that you
have either too much timing, too much air (relative to fuel), or too much
compression.  You should continue running the higher octane, or take other
steps to alleviate the detonation, such as retarding the timing, richening
the fuel mixture, or reducing the compression ratio of the engine.

As for accelerating up a hill in 4th gear with a 1641 type 1 engine in a
campmobile, well, you can just forget about that.  ;)  I'm happy if I just
don't have to downshift!
