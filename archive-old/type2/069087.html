Gregor,

my first reply to you was undeliverable, so I'm sending this to the whole
list instead.

The reading should be constant for Volkswagens, at least that's my
understanding from reading Ben Watson's &quot;How to ... Bosch FI&quot; book, p.81.
According to him, you should be getting:

40-300 Ohm between terminals 6 &amp; 7
130-260 &quot; &quot; 6 &amp; 8
200-400 &quot; &quot; 6 &amp; 9
100-500 &quot; &quot; 7 &amp; 8
70-140 &quot; &quot; 8 &amp; 9

You may also want to check the wiring harness by measuring resistance at
the harness connector from the ECU.

Hope this helps :)
