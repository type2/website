Volks,

well, I wasn't, then I was, then ....I am torn on this one.  On one hand,
it looks like a lot of work and totally impractical, on the other hand,
there are a *lot* of wasserboxer blocks out there and it *might* be
do-able....  What do y'all think?

A wasserboxer engine converted to AIR-COOLED!

A wasserboxer is really a watercooled T1 engine!  Remove the watercooled
part and you have a durable engine that is 2.1L STOCK!!

It can easily be converted to air cooled!  Simply cut the water jackets off,
and add an oil cooler sandwhich at the oil filter base to add an oil cooler,
add all the T1 parts to finish out the best choice for a &quot;Bullet-proof&quot; T1
based engine.
--------

ADD: 044 heads, extractor exhaust, cam, Rhino 1.25 ratio rocker arms, dual
carbs, 94mm strocker aircooled p/c set, external oil cooler, full balance
and you are looking at  120hp plus easy.
---------
The engine is based off the Universal case so it will fit most EVERY THING
STOCK from a T1 engine: fuel pump, heads, exhaust, cam, cylinder tin,
mounting locations, oil pump, generator stand W/gen. or alt, rocker arms,
valve covers,
It will fit into a stock engine bay with minimal modifications!!



Pros:

:The accessories are cheaper than T4 parts
:The case is 100% ALUMINUM,

:Uses T4 hyd_dot_cam followers or can be sleeved to run T1 followers.

:Crank has 228mm T4 flywheel.

:Stock crank can be welded &amp; offset ground to 78.4mm.

:The STOCK stud pattern allows you to use Porsche 911 Pistons &amp;  Cyl. or 103
&amp; 105mm T4!

:Can VERY safely be punched out to 2978cc 86x105,

:Can useT1 AIR-COOLED Cylinder heads!

:Has FULL FLOW oil built in w/filter.

:CAN USE MANY T1 Performance parts NOT expensive T4 parts.


**Use cases that have the water jackets that are pitted and unusable to be
used in a watercooled engine, should be able to get cheap.

CONS?
