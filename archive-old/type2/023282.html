Subject: Re: [T2] Power steering on an early bus

I'd like to hear of the details when you succeed.

You need to examine how the smog pump was attached on the 70s buses and 
modify these mounts to fit your power steering. One fellow I spoke with one 
time had mounted an a/c compressor on top of the Type IV shroud and 
suffered stress cracks fairly quickly. You may have to get creative. Also 
checkout how the OEM style VW bus a/c systems mounted their compressors - 
lower driver's side of the fan shroud.

You should also take a good look at the Ford system and power steering 
systems found on other VW products --- Rabbits, Vanagons, other model cars. 
See if the steering box is a bolt on replacement -- many other parts are.

The Ford push-ram style is probably the best solution.

Another direction is checking around with the hot rodders in your area. 
Many of those folks are retro fitting power steering to these cars. Model 
'A' Fords are notorious for lacking space for a large domestic style power 
steering box. I have seen the ram style power steering systems on these 
cars. (We've built several but stayed with manual steering).

Also - take a look at the electric assist systems used on some of the 
hybrid cars now.

Lastly - be sure to take a good look at the Asian imports. They have very 
compact and durable systems and may be able to be converted for use on the VW.

Hope I sparked some ideas. I don't have a perfect solution but these are 
the areas I would investigate.

&gt;I posted this when the list was down , so I will try again.....
&gt;
&gt;an old friend called the other day asking if I knew of a way to put power
&gt;steering on his buses,
&gt;
&gt;he has a 66 Kombi and a 73 Westy
&gt;
&gt;He hurt his shoulder badly and even at the best it will never be strong
&gt;again,
&gt;he needs to be able to parallel park where he lives and works, and the hard
&gt;steering of the bus is too much for him.......
&gt;
&gt;SO.....any ideas ?
&gt;
&gt;the pump on the motor is not the problem , and I know some old Ford Mustangs
&gt;had Power assist which was an extra hydraulic ram to push - pull the steering
&gt;arms
&gt;
&gt;He really wants to drive his buses , I hate to see him have to sell them
&gt;.......
&gt;
&gt;thanks for your collective help.......
