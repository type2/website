Oil cooler seals or the cooler itself.
You can do it all with the engine in-situ.

You don't even have to remove the fanshroud from the compartment -just unbolt
it all and sort of set it up out of your way to the left.

Put a new cooler on it just-to-be-sure- costya 40-60 rocks i think.

Cooler seals might still leak - anybody know sure-fire on preventing initial
cooler seal leakage?

The leak also might be the pressure switch, but unlikely - only bad/poorly
installed switches leak.

&gt; Hi guys,
&gt; I am working through the various problems on my 76 Kombi purchased 2 months
&gt; ago. On the weekend I pressure washed the engine in preparation for
&gt; roadworthiness inspection on monday (surprise, it passed!) and afterwards I
&gt; saw oil dripping down the engine case just in front of the oil filter and
&gt; the oil filter itself was dripping. Thought it might have been the filter
&gt; seal and as it was due did an oil change and filter change.Couldnt see
&gt; anything untoward on the filter mount face.
&gt; Oil is still dripping. Is this likely to be the oil cooler seals? can they
&gt; be replaced without pulling the motor?
&gt; I have already done pushrod tube seals and fan hub seal.
&gt; thanks,
&gt; Jeff
