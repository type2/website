&gt;The Continental looks pretty good, an all season tire with a comparable load

&gt;our needs in that regard.  My question would be whether I should choose 
&gt;something with a higher load range to accommodate a well loaded camping 
&gt;Westy.  The price is pretty good too.  So I guess it comes down to weighing 
&gt;which variable is the most important for my needs and contributes most to 
&gt;performance and handling.

I have the Continental tires and they are superb but if you truly load up your bus to 5000 lbs I would get a tire with a heftier load rating.
