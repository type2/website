They do carry them. They told me its the ONLY thing they carry for the
pancake engine. Its like $19.95 and worth it. No holes to drill. Just
replace your old dipstick with the new one and it comes with an easy splice
in to your existing temp sensor.

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; From looking at the Gene Berg website, I am uncertain if they make
&gt; one for a 76 baywindow bus or not.
&gt;
&gt; Is my only pre-manufactured option (I don't think I want to tackle
building
&gt; my own, 2 months later I will still be sitting around with the parts and
no
&gt; progress) the one where you have to drill something?
&gt;
&gt; Any tips, info, or insults are welcome and looked upon favorably,
&gt;
