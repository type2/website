Subject: 80 Westy Fuel Pump Relay Troubles

Hey ya'll

Thought I would post my latest experience with my fuel pump relay.  I was 
tooling down the road towards Reno when the van just died.  Pulled over and 
started troubleshooting.  I found that when I turned the ignition on, 
activated the fuel pump switch inside the air flow meter, the relay could 
be made to be intermittent by tapping on it or wiggling the connectors. 
 Aha, I thought, bad relay.  Removed the relay and opened it up.  Sure 
enough, I found several cold solder joints and the tabs connected to the 
relay solenoid were loose.  Soldered them up and we ran.  However, since I 
was in Reno stopped in at J &amp; R VW Vans.  These guys work a lot on 
Vanagons, Synchros and Westfalias.  They had a new relay in stock so just 
to be on the safe side I bought it and installed same.

Don't know if the new relay is the cause, but I noticed immediately a 
smoother idle and an increase in mileage from an average of 17 to an 
average of 20.  I changed nothing else.

Thanks for listening.
