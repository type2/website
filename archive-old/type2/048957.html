Subject: Re: [T2] 73 Orange Bus made out of gold

Asking price and selling price can be very different. For instance there is
a 1978 Champagne Edition bus listed for sale on www. traderonlie. It was
first listed for something like $15000 and the ad made a big to-do about the
unbelievably low mileage of 120,000. After being on the market for sometime
the asking price has dropped below $8000. I suspect it will go for much
less.

&gt; Mike-
&gt; One can ask whatever one wants...Keep an eye on the ad and see if it
&gt; sells at that
&gt; price.
