Subject: FI AC VW shops NJ to Fla??

(to list also, bear with me!)
 Kevin, Seeing your  Fla residence made me wonder.....We are planning to go
down to Fla (Sanibel, Keys, and are debating whether to take our 78 Westie
(good body), which has been riding on the &quot;luck of the sloppy fairies&quot; to
its current 170,000 miles.  (Sloppy fairies let you into scrapes, but keep
them from being severe!)  Never an accident while running, but TWICE it's
rolled down the steep hill from garage to (1) hit the house, but right
where a plywood piece was, totally missing a window and in ground
basketball pole within a foot of either side!  This was just before our
round the country trip last summer (150K mi then), so we did a fasty (pull
out and bondo job) to fix rear taillite.  Been that way ever since; haven't
seen a non-rusty van to cut entire rear corner out of (body shop said you'd
have to cut outside of roofgutter, hatch frame, below battery tray, and
outside of welded seam behind sliding door of a parts van to get entire
piece suitable for welding in...(2) Now, it rolled again, but missed house
and ran into gravel pile in front of our aboveground pool, just grazing
side of pool and cracking other rear corner lens- that looks easier to fix,
since area above the &quot;tray&quot; section is ok.  Anyway,  we are vying for the
show class (will it ever exist) MOST MILES LEAST FIXES, since the car's
engine is still original,  ONLY failure requiring outside parts was one
heater box (flange rot), axle boot (big deal),  pushrod seals (easy fix)
heat assist fan, and usual muffler and brake pads.- oh yes, I should count
the tape I had to put on leaky air hose in FI??   Since I was concerned
about clutch lining before our big trip,  I went thru effort of pulling the
engine and finding it still had at least 25,000 mi on it, but replaced it
along with clutch cable and gas cable; old ones looked ok.   It has been
giving that rattling sound (in engine) when &quot;freewheeling&quot; at high revs
(when you let go of gas), but it's been doing that for 10,000 mi now and
sounds great otherwise.  Now I know this attitude requires much
wood-knocking and carrying of spare parts (all that FI stuff is still under
the bench), so if we take it to Fla, I'd like to be prepared- we have Good
Sam protection (will take it to ANYWHERE where it can be fixed, even if
it's 300 mi!), and would like a network of places that will touch a Type2
FI engine (make that REPLACE it if necessary)- so how many of you are there
near Rt. 95 in Fla or nearby states of Ga, Carolinas, and Va?   I'll make
this public to the list so others can give addies for help?      Mike
Benthin
