Hi everyone,
    I just installed a new solex 34pict3 in my bus and when I started it up,
it coughed and sputtered and basically ran like crap. I couldn't get the
idle to smooth out no matter which screw I turned. What could this be?
Adjusting the air/fuel mixture makes absolutely no noticeable difference to
the way it runs. At least these new symptoms have helped my bus name
herself: Weezy.

TIA,
Jeff
