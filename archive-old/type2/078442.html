Subject: Re: [T2] torque wrench

Whether I am using a very high quality Sturdevant, Sanp-On bar type or a
less expensive clicker (not knocking clickers) when I pull the head bolts
to torque I notice that with both types (bar or clicker) that the nut
will rotate as much as a half flat after you reach the torque if you hold
it there. In an effort to equalize torque settings I bring all of the
bolts to approximately 75% of the specified torque and then follow the
sequence one more time and they seem to draw up smother and in effect set
at the final point without the little bit of final slippage.
I don't like to be a stickler for details and I really don't think that
final little SET actually changes the ultimate torque but I've gotten
accustomed to my method and I figure its like cutting the bottom off a
door &quot;Measure Twice, Cut Once&quot;.
