Subject: AIRS Update: Dave Ireland is now back on the road.

Hi Volks,

Dave is now back under way; he just called me from upper NY state. They
tapped the hole and put a bolt in with LOTS of loctite and got rolling by
2:30 PM.

He stopped in for a visit at AIRS-member Dave Wolfganger; DW had fresh
cookies waiting and gave Dave a tour of his impressive stash of air-cooled
goodies. I'll leave that story to Dave when he gets back.

Thanks to all who emailed their concern and advice. AIRS is really a special
thing to bus ownership and today I'm especially proud to be on the roster.

Happy trails indeed,

Greg Potts
