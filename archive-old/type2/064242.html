&gt; Can any CB-ers out there advise me on the relative merits
&gt; of different CBs?
&gt; I just want 2 cheap second hand ones for occasional use
&gt; in our 2 buses. Is there anything I should know? (I know
&gt; nothing).
&gt;
Actually, I'd be interested in this as well. Having a CB would have made
multi-bus traveling a lot more pleasant, so I'm planning on getting one one
day.
