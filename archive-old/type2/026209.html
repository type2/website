	&gt; I know that buying off the truck is convenient, but geeze, does
the Matco
	&gt; guy sell crack too?

	List,
	If you've never been on a tool truck before, hop on one some time if
you 
	get the chance.  Its like a big kids candy store :)  Except its more

	than 50 cents for a candy bar.

A few years ago I was getting desperate for a uni-syn so I could balance the
dual carbs on my Type 3s and I ended up paying nearly $50 from a Matco
truck.  Not long after that the VW parts houses started carrying them for
$20.  I hate when that happens.
