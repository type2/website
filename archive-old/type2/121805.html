&gt; After some lengthy cranking last night I got it to start and run.  
&gt; Once it warmed up it runs fine.  I think I have a bad thermo-time

&gt; what it is doing (I have the bentley manual procedure for testing 
&gt; this).  My current question is: do these things (the thermo-time 
&gt; switch) go bad or is it likely just a grounding issue?   I have seen a 
&gt; couple of sources for these so I guess that someone is replacing them.

I had a &quot;cold start&quot; problem like this on my '76 FI.  It started 
happening after I had a rebuilt engine installed.

In my case, the problem turned out to be a bad (almost non-existent, 
really) connection of the battery + strap on the solenoid (it was 
mis-installed long before I bought the bus when the PO replaced the 
solenoid; I guess the engine replacement work must have just jarred it 
loose.. the eye wasn't even over the post on the solenoid).  In the 
process of tracking down the problem, I also replaced my ratty original 
battery ground strap with a nice new insulated one.

Once the electrical problem was eliminated, my &quot;cold start&quot; problem 
went away completely.  I guess the poor connection was simply causing 
weak spark that was mitigated once the heads warmed up.

My suggestion would be to eliminate all electrical possibilities first 
(like ground and + strap).  I suspect the ground strap is more likely 
to go bad after 25 years than the thermo-time switch.
