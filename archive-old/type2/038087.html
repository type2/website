Subject: Small Electrical Connectors?

You all tired of hearing from me yet?

Anybody know where I can find some really small female electrical
connectors?  The ones that attach my wiring harness to the rear side marker
lights on my 73 Westy have rotted off (on the side where the battery is - go
figure!).  Now, I know I can fabricate something by cutting some regular
sized ones in half and such, but surely that particular size is available?

Thanks!
