Subject: RE: [T2] Windshields-to-go

Jim,

I did get the quote from the site below. I even responded that you had got
yours for $80 and asked how I could get a similar price. I even offered to
pick it up at the local warehouse as you did. Their answer was. . .

&quot;I'm sorry Robert, but that is the cheapest windshield available for your
windshield.&quot;

My buddy at the body shop can order me one for less than their quoted price.
I guess they won't be getting my business.


&gt; Go to:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.windshieldstogo_dot_com/index.html
&gt; 
&gt; and fill out the quote form.  They'll get back to you in a 
&gt; couple of days with the price.  When I called their 800 
&gt; number, I was quoted a higher price, so I tried the website 
&gt; just for reference, and when that quote was cheaper, I used 
&gt; it when I called to order my windshield.  As far as the $123 
&gt; charge goes, it could include shipping, which I was quoted as 
&gt; being in the $45 range.  I actually drove to a near-by 
&gt; warehouse and picked up my windshield in person.
