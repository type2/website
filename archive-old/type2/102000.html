&gt; &gt; I agree with Robb that they really improve the handling of a bus and are

&gt; This is odd.  I have found my bus to be next-to-impossible to stick, even in
&gt; a foot-deep sticky mudbog that stopped three 4WD American trucks cold!  When
&gt; it snowed the other day, I noticed that when I spun the tires, I left two

well some comments
 I have Michelin 205/70R14 all season tires on my 78 
 and with an auto tranny I deffinately don't have a limited slip rear end

But this week up in the mountains near Somerset PA, I got out every
morning in the snow and up the &quot;hill&quot; to the ski slopes at 7:30 am couple
times passing on the steep parts stuck front wheel drive and even a 4WD
vehicle,  now if starting at -7F would be as easy....But it did start
every time (so I helped a little with a shot of ether)
