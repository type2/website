Subject: Re: RE: Fuel Neck - Possible fix?

I'm dealing with this fuel neck thing, and I have not figured how to remove 
it. Can it be removed and put back on without pulling the tank? I can't tell 
if there's some type of clamp holding it on, but I can't seem to remove it 
(in one piece) from the filler hole.

Any help on this is greatly appreciated!
