The Amazon Snowbird escapes from Devon Conversions

The bus is dead, long live the bus!

Well my long awaited adventures in my NEW 1998 Brazilian T2 camper have
begun...

Tuesday morning the phone rings and it's Beetles UK to say the camper
conversion has been done and when do I want to pick it up from the
converters [to save my self £300(UK)/$500(US) I said I would deliver it
back to them myself]. I replied &quot;tomorrow&quot;. Then hastily arranged
for it to be on my insurance, got myself a one way train ticket, and a day
off work.

The alarm roused me from a fitful sleep at 4am, and I was down to the
railway station for a 5am train. Five hours later I pulled in to Durham
station, Where I was picked up by Steve from Devon Conversions
and driven out to their workshops.

There were 20 or so campers of all shapes and sizes in the workshop but my
eye was drawn to the white T2 in the corner. MINE. So hop inside and check
out the camper conversion. The rock and roll bed glides into position and
all
 the
cupboard doors open OK. The tap works (10 imperial gallon tank) and the
 interior
lights come on. All the other camper bits present and correct. The absence
of bulkheads behind the seats (as on the late European production delux
minibus T2) makes the interior seem bigger. The higher roof gives a couple
of
 inches more head room across the full width of the bus compared to a
European
 T2 with no pop-top.

No windscreen wipers - but they are in a box in the back. Find some nuts to
hold them on and I'm off.

The first thing I noticed (well after the hodometer reading of 28km) when I
got in is that the speedo is km/h ONLY; mph does not even appear in little
numbers so I have to convert all the speed limits in my head as I go.
Another oddity is that there are no tenths of km on the hodometer)

It's wierd driving a left hand drive - I keep trying to change gear with
the window winder - and the road position is very odd (remember we drive on
the left so right hand drive is the order of the day here in the UK). Fill
up with petrol and onto the motorway

The lower gears on this bus seem to be &quot;shorter&quot; than on my old one I'm
having to change gear at lower speeds. First gear is very low definitly only
 for
pulling away. The gear box is very positive; several times I missed a
gear because there is a final resistance when moving out of the gate and
into a gear, but its a good feeling when you're used to it as you know that
you have the gear.

The seats are comfortable, with shaped squabs and headrests. Both passenger
and driver seats are adjustable in position and rake of the back; no
num-bums sliding forward off the passenger seat in this bus.

The steering wheel is smaller than my old '73 but the rim is thicker so is
easier to hold; steering is light but positive.

So here I am cruising along the motorway at 100Km/h and this bus wants to
GO, I'm only at half throttle with ACCELERATION availlable for overtaking.

Someone once asked what the difference between a Type 1 and a Type 4
engined bus was - I replied that a Type 4 engined bus would accelerate up
hills but a Type 1 engined bus would slow down. Well I publicaly eat those
words. This engine will out run the heavy lorries. I took it up to 110Km/h
(our national speed limit) and it did not seem to be labouring, This
aircooled 1600 FI engine is a flyer. On hills where I would expect my
carburetted 1600 twin port to slow down I was able to hold speed and
accelerate.

After 320km(200miles) at 100km/h(60mph) when I stoped for petrol I applied
the dipstick test and I could not only comfortably touch the top of dipstick
 but I
could comfortably hold it; so even on warm summers day it seems to be
running
 cool too. The fuel consumption was about 25mpg (imperial) / 20mpg (US)
which
 is 10 to 15% better than my old bus at that speed; its unleaded petrol
 (cheeper than leaded) too so I win on the swings and the roundabouts.

This VW Digifant (Bosch L-Jetronic variant) FI engine is good news; with its
 pulsed injectors, lambda sensor, and catalytic converter its both mean and
 clean.

Well those are my first impressions of MY new Brazilian T2 and I think
I'm going to like this camper. The only down side is that after 5.5 hours
and driving it for 300 miles I've given it back to Beetles UK for conversion
 to righthand drive, undersealing etc. and it could be a month
before I get it back.

Any way I shall report more about VWs lastest aircooled Type 2 when I get
it back and have used it a bit more.

For the UK &quot;guys and gals&quot; going to  VANFEST '98
 (http://members.aol_dot_com/vanfest/index.htm), if I
have the bus back by then it will be there in the DEVON conversion display
and
 you will recognise me because I will be the guy going round with the grin
so
 wide I will have to walk through doors sideways. If not I will be the guy
 trying to hide a Fiat 126 behind his tent.

Please note that I know nothing about how to import these busses into any
 country in the world - not even the UK. No E-mail on subject of the import
or
 export of busses will be replied to
