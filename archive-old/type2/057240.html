Subject: Re: New 1.8 in 73 Westy

&gt;I just had a rebuilt 1.8 put in my westy. It was running okay, but some
&gt;backfire (more like a sputter) on downshifts.

Sounds like an exhaust leak to me.

&gt;Also dieseling after shutdown.

I've never been able to get rid of that.  I just let the clutch out right
after I turn off the key (in gear, with my foot on the brake).

&gt;It's running dual mini-webbers.

I wonder how many 73 busses there are left with stock carbs?  Am I the only
one?

&gt;Checked all exhaust connections took it back to mechanic that
&gt;installed/tuned &gt;it. He rejetted the carbs, but still sputter and still
&gt;dieseling. Any &gt;suggestions? (Fuel/air mixture was also set by mechanic)

Idle mixture may be wrong.  Did he set that too?

&gt;I lost some faith in this mechanic when, in place of what I believe is
&gt;&gt;supposed to be a cooling flap (A hole in the tin that runs underneath
&gt;near the &gt;oil cooler) I found A COKE CAN CUT AND PAINTED BLACK TO MATCH
&gt;THE TIN.

It's not a cooling flap, it's where a heater pipe is supposed to come
through the tin.  If the heater pipe is missing (it should go to your heat
exchanger) then it would leave a big hole which would let hot air in.
Since you can't just walk into Chief Auto and buy that pipe, I'd credit
your mechanic for using his noggin and sealing off the leak the best way he
knew how.
