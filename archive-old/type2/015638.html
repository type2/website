&gt;&gt;I simply disagree. The AFM units cannot be recalibrated anywhere except on
&gt;&gt;a Bosch bench. They hold the procedures to do this and the data as secret.
&gt;&gt;Anyone else is guessing. It's a glorified practice of poking screwdrivers
&gt;
&gt;BS, nothing at all is &quot;secret&quot; about any of it.  If someone were so inclined
&gt;they could easily chart the data themselves off of a new or Bosch rebuilt
&gt;AFM on a flow bench. 

Certainly, if they have a flow bench handy. That's what, maybe 1 in 100
shops?? But the bench alone won't do it. You also must have someone skilled
to operate it. I warrent that a new AFM is less costly, and certainly a
whole lot faster, as regards billable time, and most certainly longevity of
results.

 I'd warrant it would take about 20 minutes or so
&gt;to generate the curve at sufficient flow points.  I could run down to my old
&gt;aero department and do it myself if I was so inclined. 

So, if anyone needs engineering skills, please apply to John. Be sure to
verify the rate required to hire this level of skill. An aero department is
even better than a flow bench, but I don't know anyone who could afford to
hire Boeing to recalibrate their AFM.

 From there is would
&gt;be an easy matter to recalibrate other units assuming no parts are needed
&gt;because those certainly will be unobtainable. 

When wear is the problem, the assumption must be that parts are required.

 Regardless it isn't really
&gt;necessary because the real world test of the AFM is whether or not it
&gt;can maintain a proper air/fuel relationship under load across a suitable
&gt;range of rpm/air flows.  Anyone with a dyno and an emissions tester can
&gt;verify that easily enough. 

And if it doesn't and you don't have the aero department available,
replacing it is far more wise than dinking with it.

 For our mini formular cars we did just that
&gt;all the time, recalibrating AFMs to our liking and application either on
&gt;the dyno or on the track with portable emissions and data aquisition
&gt;equipment. 

That's just superb. That's what I would do if I couldn't live with good
results from factory procedures, and had the extra money laying around or a
benificent supporter for a race team.

 More than a few companies do it for high performance
&gt;applications.  Now as I've alluded it isn't going to necessarily be
&gt;economically practical for a stock application or worth even your own
&gt;time or effort. 

Indeed, stock ist best. Doesn't require specialized equipment or procedures.

 The only reason Bosch written FI manuals say to keep
&gt;that lid on is because Bosch will be happy to sell you a new AFM.

That's not the only reason. Another is that it opens the door to
contamination. Another is any tweek you do to a spring that is out from
having lost it's temper has nothing whatsoever to do with recalibration.
You can't recalibrate, by definition, if the parts aren't spec. Have you
seen the spec for the spring loading?? Just one of many things you would
have to reverse engineer to KNOW what your are doing, as opposed to guessing.

&gt;But if you let an idiot fool with it, expect the consequences, I admit
&gt;nothing scares me more than looking at a new to me bus running
&gt;poorly where that wonder silicone has been scraped away and the
&gt;lid pried off.  

Couldn't agree more, particularly if I don't have the data and record of
the engineer who was in there tweeking and 'recalibrating'. At the very
least I want to see his/her resume so I can deterime if he/she has the
credentials required of someone who could be expected to honor the title of
engineer and is competant to expand upon criteria of the factory team
he/she follows.  

However, I'd be willing to bet that the original vanagon list
&gt;saved 100's of people the cost of new Digifant AFMs over the years by
&gt;telling people to simply move the circuit board or bend the brushes a bit
&gt;to restore worn resistance tracks.

And the one's who tried that then had to replace it anyway with another
weekend or two of futzing around less than a year later are generally
disinclined to advertise there foolishness by reporting the poor results
and additional lost time/money.

I have no problem with owners experimenting on their vehicle in whatever
manner they deem appropriate for their intended purposes. I draw the line
when someone HIRES someone to fix the problem and then this vendor ignores
given procedures 'cause they think they know better, then bill it as an
effective repair.
