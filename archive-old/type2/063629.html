Subject: cv joint socket size and ?s

 hey now,

 well, i took a look at the halfshaft i have to take off and started spraying
 liquid wrench on a couple of the bolts. i got two off real easily. one i think
 i might of stripped. ack.

 okay i've done cv joints before but i seem to have lost the socket thingy i
 used to have. the one i bought today works but doesn't seem quite right.
 what exactly is the thingy i need call and what size is it supposed to be?
 the sockets are star shaped.

 what can i do for a stripped head?

 jonathan
