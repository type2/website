Subject: Re: Cooling - 1600Sp vs 1600DP

Because I mostly travel in very hot weather, i'm
curious about the benefits of diverting the fan
housing air.

does it keep the engine cooler to BLOCK the clean-air
ducts, putting more air through the cylinders or to
keep them hooked up in the stock configuration
(blowing the heat off the heat exchangers?)

Normally, I try to keep everything stock, but i'm in
the middle of a fresh-air hose hassle right now and am
looking for an excuse to put it off until winter.

Tony in NJ sez :
On my 71 1600, I capped off the air ducts from the fan
housing
...snip...If you live in a very warm climate ..snip...
the air ducts might not be used and the &quot;extra&quot;
air better used to cool the engine...
