A few people have asked me about my cruise control since I mentioned on
the list that i installed one in my bus.
It's an Audiovox and I bought it from JCWhintey. It was like 100$ in all.
I also purchased an extra vacuum canister that they recommended for
vehicles with four or less cylinders.  In the Type2 library someone gives
detailed instructions on how to set it all up. I followed them (and the
instructions that came with the cruise control) and it all works great.  
The cruise control worked best for me in Florida because there are no big
hills there.  Usually the cruise control would just cut out if the hill
was steep enough that the engine wasn't able to maintain the set speed. 
Traveling at 65mph, the cruise control cut out alot more than when I was
traveling 70mph because of the higher rpms it takes to travel 70 as
opposed to 65. I didn't really notice a change in my gas mileage for
better or worse since using the cruise control. 
I have an 1800cc engine in my bus, and I suppose that with the extra
200cc that a two liter would offer, you might be able to keep the cruise
control on over more hills.   I know that all this about hills and not
downshifting brings up overheating the engine and lugging it and whatnot,
and I won't get into that. You just need to know when to turn the cruise
control off and when is a good time to  use it. It's mostly common sense.
