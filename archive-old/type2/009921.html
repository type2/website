Your tin pieces should include:

- deflectors between cylinders and pushrod tubes, one each side, 
  one symmetrical, one assymmetrical
- front top (FIF)
- front bottom (left and right)
- covers (left and right)
- bottom tin (left and right)
- pieces between fan shroud and cylinders (left and right)
- three pieces of rear tin: left, right (through which the oil 
  filler tube passes) and center
- a piece that encircles the front of the alternator
