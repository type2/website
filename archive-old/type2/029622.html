&gt; the 32/36 is a weber carb, but the license to manufacture and sell it was
&gt; given to Holley (bought, I presume). There are Weber carbs, and Holley/Weber
&gt; carbs.

And, there are lots of permutations of Holley-weber carbs out there!
Everything from simple &quot;replacement&quot; carbs to nasty water-activated chokes
and lots of smog variations.  I had one of these on a stock P*ntiac Astre
(their version of the Vega) that couldn't be tuned for love nor money!
