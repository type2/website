+AD4-recommended using the sheathed steel brake cable sold in bicycle shops

I'm not sure whether this would work. The original cable has a stiff centre
wire which exerts a push on the lever on the control box. There is a spring
on the control box lever which ought to take up the slack but I don't think
it's strong enough to pull a multistrand flexible cable through. A bike
cable makes a good replacement for the thermostat cable though.

I've had the same problem of the cable bending at the cab end though and I
figured you've got to make sure everything is fully greased up to allow the
inner to slip through the outer. I even considered putting some assist
springs on the control box levers.

Anyways, the cables are readily available  - in UK, Just Kampers have them.
