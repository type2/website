Subject: Re: Brake Booster Hose Replacement

&gt;Hmmmm.... did the '72-on buses use a brake booster like the '71? If they
did, then it would reason that in order to retrofit a Type II case to a
post-71 bus, you'd need the '71 (one-year) manifold?

Hi Joe,

Well, it's fairly simple just to use an adapter (if the engine's installed)
or braze the correct fitting on the manifold (if the engine's out) to make
the commonly available bug parts work.  Using the smaller bug port with an
adapter won't affect booster function.  '71-'79 US buses had a power
booster.  I should clarify that I was speaking about US buses when I made my
&quot;one year only&quot; manifold comment.  I'm not clear on the availability of
power brake booster on '71-up buses elsewhere in the world, it's possible
that these manifolds were used for many years on '72-up 1600cc equipped buses.

&gt;Thanks Joe (sitting on a stash of one 71 manifold; hoping to fund my kid's
college edjukashun with it.)

Sounds uncomfortable.  ;)

Ron
