&gt; Hence the '68-'78 manual would be a real nice piece if it has color

&gt; you ask about color diagrams.  Also the covers are thicker, as are all
&gt; the pages I think in all original manuals compared with the reprints.

The color diagrams extended to the '68-78 manuals.  My '68-'79 manual has
color diagrams for '68-'78 and B/W for 1979. I have never seen (and have
looked hard for) a color '79 wiring diagram.  The color wiring diagram at
vintagebus_dot_com is color because I brought it into Photoshop and had at it.  
AFAIK, no color wiring diagram was ever published for a Vanagon.  Maybe
one of these days when I have *way* too much time on my hands... :-)
