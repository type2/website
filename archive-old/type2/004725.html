Has anyone used http://www.timesert_dot_com/howtosp.htm for repair of a stripped
out oil plug?

I suspect I'll be needing a fix next time I do an oil change on my Westy.
Oil plug did not come out easy this change and even though it torqued back
up, it didn't seem right and there were some fillings when I removed it. I'm
using those one time copper washers and think I'll go to the aluminum ones
next. I'm using the crush aluminum one on my GL and I've been having no
problem. PO might have over torqued it as it was a bear getting off the
first time. 18ft-lbs isn't very much. The plug is not original so I suspect
it was redone at one time in the past.

I would like to do it right and not have to worry about it. Timesert is
steel on steel and should last longer than the motor itself. If anyone has
tried this method, drop me a line and tell me what you think of it both pro
and cons.

TIA
Bill
