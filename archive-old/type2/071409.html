Subject: Removing Rear Axle...that big nut

I've 46mm axle tool works best for me. Plus you walk into any hardware store
with your Cracksman breaker bar, and buy 3 feet of black pipe for $6 bucks.
They'll cut it right there for you, stick the breaker bar in the end so you
know you got the right pipe first. Then get some good big heavy chocks for the
wheels. soak the axles with wd 40 a couple nights in advance and again 15
minutes beforehand. position your 46mm tool at 11 O'clock on the wheel, use
your 1/2&quot; to 3/8&quot; adaptor to your breaker bar, have assistant hand you the
length of pipe, slide it into position on the breaker bar with your left hand
as you hold the tool snug on the nut. Slide backward holding the bar/pipe
assembly steady, now grab hold of the rain gutter one hand at a time as you
carefully stand up on the pipe with feet positioned a foot apart and keeping
your balance bounce gently up and down as your assistant steps in with a 5 lb
hand sledge and gives the pipe a couple of good whacks to your right, on the
pipe just before it meets the breaker bar. That should crack it, if it
doesn't, shift the pipe and then your weight to the rear and/or have the
assistant recommence whacking further in. In my vision both people where a
crash helmet so if they fall the person who told them to do it is named
'Timmy' and he said he wasn't really a mechanic at all, just thought he knew a
few things and doesn't want to go to Jail for it.
