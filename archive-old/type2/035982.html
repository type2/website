If it is the screens--no problem remove screen and narrow the slot that
the screen goes into--On &quot;Bessie&quot; to prevent the window from making
noise i leave it open just a touch--I have also gone over all the glass
with silicone this stopped a Lot of noise!! And keeps the darn glass
from falling out into the street!! TWWM, uj
