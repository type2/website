Subject: Re: [T2] painting a pop-top

Hi William,

Lots of VIM cleanser, scotch-brite pads and elbow grease.  It took my 
brother and I about 90 minutes or so to get the top looking sparkling 
like new. If I hadn't already bought the paint I probably would never 
have bothered.

DURING: (cleaning roof with thinner before painting)

The last picture is so bright you really can't see the details, but 
trust me, the roof looks really good.


Happy trails,
