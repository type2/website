Subject: Type 4 conversion-MSHP knows how to do it

Say you have a really great looking loaf...(like mine)or you lived
in Calif. where you have smog regulations ...
Then rather than try and find a later bus that might not be so nice
or needed to be smogged you would take the trouble to do the conversion.
