&gt; Quoth Lyle:
&gt; &gt; No physical problem running any number of shims, but you have to ask why
&gt; &gt; the play has opened up so much that you need to add a 4th shim.  Is the
&gt; &gt; wear on the aft side of the thrust surface or the forward side?  If it is
&gt; &gt; on the forward side, you will be forcing the crankshaft to run further aft
&gt; &gt; than it was designed to do, perhaps causing misalignment to the other
&gt; &gt; bearings.  

Minor correction:  I should have said &quot;forcing the crankshaft to run
further _forward_...&quot;.  FIF and all that rot.

&gt; &gt; Another possibility is that the thrust bearing is loose in the case, so
&gt; &gt; you are measuring the play between the bearing and the case, not
&gt; &gt; the clearance between the shim pack and the bearing.  If you put in enough
&gt; &gt; shim thickness to fix this, you'll find your crank locked up as the thrust
&gt; &gt; bearing will be trapped between the shims and the crank.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I reduced the play from 10 to about 6-7 thou using 3 thicker
&gt; shims- and you were right about it locking up when I tried to reduce
&gt; play to .004 using a stack of four that only measured about 2.5 thou
&gt; thicker.  Watched the thrust bearing as I push pulled the crank via the
&gt; flywheel bolts or the fan, and you could see it moving in and out a
&gt; bitr- does this mean my &quot;measured end play of about 7 thou is actually
&gt; about 4 thou??

Yes, 3 or 4 thousandths.  I'd be more comfortable with a couple of
thousandths more than that.  If it's too tight it will lock up and spin
the bearing when the engine warms up.  Better to be a bit on the loose
side.

&gt; I'll leave it alone at that. Rotated the crank, which
&gt; tends to reduce the free play as it turns counter to normal rotation,
&gt; increases it again when yo reverse that, but noticed no spinning of the
&gt; bearing.

The bearing is pinned in place,

&gt; Tried to pry up the crank a la Muir, couldn't notice
&gt; movement.  The rearfacing side of the bearing doesn't look worn by the
&gt; shims.   Gotta ask -the bearing has to be softer than it steel it faces
&gt; on the flywheel side or the crank/rod side, but harder than the saddle
&gt; it sits in?  So is it saddle wear or bearing wear?  I assume any inout
&gt; play is due to saddle pounding or wear of bearing sides facing saddle?
&gt; 

Probably the saddle is a bit worn due to thermal cycling and the resultant
movement of the bearing.  Technically, there shouldn't be any movement
between the bearing and case, but anytime you put dissimilar metals in
contact and change temperatures something has to give...  That's why they
do align-boreing
