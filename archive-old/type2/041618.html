Subject: Re: Re: Do two thin wires = one thick wire

and good luck figuring out any wiring problem if every &quot;wire&quot; consists of
2-3 wires. I once had a customer that thought he was clever (saving $, of
course) when he rewired the ENTIRE CAR in white wire. He had an electrical
problem (of course) and was &quot;having a tough time&quot;. Needless to say I passed
on that job!
