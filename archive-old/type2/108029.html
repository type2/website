Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor Drive Shaft is Stuck - How to Remove?

The &quot;tool&quot; you need is a dowel, just slightly larger in diameter than the
round hole in the center of the drive shaft that holds the spring.  Whittle
a slight taper in the last inch or so of the dowel and jam it down into the
hole (spring removed, of course) and then carefully lift up the drive shaft,
rotate it, and set it back down.  You then wiggle your &quot;tool&quot; free of the
hole.

Subject: [T2] Distributor Drive Shaft is Stuck - How to Remove?

&gt; I need to lift my distributor drive shaft out just a hair to rotate it
&gt; and get it to its proper alignment at 12 degrees off centerline.
&gt;
&gt; My magnets are not strong enough to pull it out.  The Bentley calls for
&gt; an expansion tool.  I can visualize what an expansion tool is but still
&gt; have not found a store that sells one that will do this job.  Puller is
&gt; perhaps a better term.
