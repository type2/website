Subject: Shrinking Headliners

Hi Guys,

I installed a headliner in my '74 Micro and it doesn't look so great :-(

I've done a couple Type 1 headliners and one early bus headliner, but this one
isn't cooperating the same.  On the other models, I used a hairdryer to
tighten the loose sections when the project was complete.  On this one, the
hairdryer isn't working... There are loose pockets here and there and the
whole thing looks kinda crappy.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Tom
