&gt; I have a '71 bus that is giving me some electrical problems.
&gt; 
&gt; 1)  Whenever I put the parking lights on, the fuel gauge pegs to max.

Wires are crossed somewhere.  Wiggle the wiring loom under the dash
and see if that has any effect.  This sort of thing is danged hard to
track down!

&gt; 2)  The left turn signal blinks fast, even though both bulbs are good.

Dirty or worn contacts in the turn signal switch.

&gt; 3)  All 4 side marker lights don't come on.  Shouldn't they come on
with
&gt; parking, normal, and brights?

The front &quot;marker lights&quot; on the doors are just reflectors.  They
don't come on at all.  The rear marker lights are connected to the
tail lights.  These tend to have bad grounds.  I've added a ground
wire to the rear markers

&gt; 4) PO disconnected the brake master cylinder warning light.  I have
only the
&gt; brown center wire identified.  Anyone able to tell me which colored
wires I
&gt; need to find disconnected for the other two connectors?

The other two wires are red (which goes to center terminal of the two
brake light switches) and black (which goes to one of the side
terminals on the brake light switches and should be hot when the
ignition's on)  The brown wire is the ground for the push-to-test
switch.
&gt; 
&gt; I have disassembled the front gauge cluster and even swapped it out
with a
&gt; '70 that I had.  ((Identical)).  No difference.  I also replaced the
left
&gt; rear turn signal / brake light housing ... as I knew it had some bad
&gt; grounding.  However, I still get fast blink on left turn signal.
&gt; 
&gt; As you know, there are two &quot;lights on&quot; indicators on the lower of
the fuel
&gt; gauge.  I think I figured out that one says &quot;parking on&quot; the other
indicates
&gt; &quot;brights on.&quot;  I find that if  disconnect this lead, the fuel gauge
does NOT
&gt; get screwed up when parking lights are turned on... and parking
lights still
&gt; work!

Perhaps this is where the crossed wires occur.  Make very sure that
all of the wires on the back of the instrument cluster are plugged
into the correct terminals.  It's very easy to make a mistake here. 
The Bentley manual has a diagram that shows which wire goes to where.
