Subject: RE: [T2] A/C belt Question

Wayne,

From a june 2003 post...

The one I cut off of my 78 Champagne Edition last year is marked

Dayco 15465  and is a little over 46 1/4&quot; long about 1176mm.

Beware that it may have stretched some and also be aware that
different A/C manufacturers may have compressor mounts that
would actually change the length required.

My unit was a DPD overhead unit with a york compressor.


Be aware that if you have the unit you referenced, that your belt may be 
different as the mount is different.  The place where you get the belt
will trade out if it is too long or short.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Thanks for your reply!  
&gt; 
&gt; 1) I have a '79 Bus. 
&gt; 2) Yes, the pulley is behind the fan (at least I think so, 
&gt;    as I've not yet taken the fan off).
&gt; 3) I think I have a VW A/C unit - it looks just link the one
&gt;    pictured on Rob's(?) site http://www.baywindowbus_dot_com/literature2.htm
&gt; 4) Yes, it looks like an old York compressor.
