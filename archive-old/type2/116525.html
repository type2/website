I guess what it all comes down to, Tony, is,
are we talking FRESH oregano or DRIED?

Knew a guy who sold grass clippings to 8th graders while he was living with a teacher. Needless to say he ran into continuing lifestyle problems for several years.

Got his first DUI in his squareback on Acid driving around with a loaded bong between the seats. Not a pipe in the glovecompartment mind you, a whole bong with water and packables.

When the cop came up to his window, the girl he was with started screaming, &quot;We're on acid, We're on Acid!&quot; 

The squareback made it to the yard shortly thereafter.

&gt;If I sold it to them for twenty-five bucks, I'd make &gt;a profit of twenty-three bucks...My dilemma: Does &gt;the list think this is a 'fair' 
&gt;profit margin or not... ?-)
