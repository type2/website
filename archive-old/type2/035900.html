It's tough to find a suitable and affordable puller.  For the 5-bolt,
drop-centre
pattern, you may already know a puller with 2 legs or 3 legs just won't
work.
I made my own ~37 years ago (good heavens!), based on pictures in an
Australian workshop manual, the best available popularly in the US at that
time.

If you have or have access to:  acetylene torch; drill press; bandsaw; and a
good hardware source like HomeDepot, then.... p-mail me and I will describe
an easy (updated) way to make a very good puller.  Also pls say where you
are geographically.
