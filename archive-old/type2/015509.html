&gt;Of course oil brand is a hot topic over there as well as well as secondary

You can use 10k change intervals to make the warrenty period without a
problem. Very comforting if you trade-in for new ever 7 years. But that
engine will not last near as long if you make your lubrication changes
based upon inspection, not milage, which takes into account the way you use
the vehicle. Even changing oil/filter by a 3k rule of thumb is a less
efficient process than by inspection, if enhanced engine life means the
best chance for lowest cost per mile long past warrenty period.  

Regarless what you put in there, verify it meets specifications as to
weight, composition and grade. Inspect it every month or 500 miles. Monitor
the transparency, color and feel. BEFORE it goes opaque, darkens beyond
heavy brown, begins to show a milky tint, feels too thin or feels like
grit, or smells of fuel, record the milage and change it. 

If your motor is filthy inside from 10k interval lubes, check it at 100
miles after change to new oil with new unloaded detergent package. It will
be black already from the new detergents disolving the heavy buildup of tar
deposited by rule of thumb notions of prolonged maintenance based upon
assumptions, rather than factual inspection.

Results?? How do you know?? I had a Mercedes minor overhaul a while back. A
factory limited 4 cyl 16 valve 2.3 liter. 100K miles. Valve guides worn.
Carbon bui1d-up  The insides of the valve train and crankcase were as clean
as the day it was assembled, not even a light tan varnish. The cam lobes
were brilliant. All the valves were in spec. but for the carbon on the
seats and faces and the guide wear. The soft guides saved every $80 spezial
silicon core exhauset valve and every $45 common German metalurgy intake
valve. Indeed, this vehicle can show documented maintenance inspection
intervals that prove where these excellant results come from, on a motor
worth the price of a very nice T-II in better than average condition. You
can buy alot of T-II's needing 'TLC' for the replacemant value of the
valves alone.

Don't do oil changes at all. Do Lubrication Inspections. Inspect every
fluid in the vehicle at regular intervals determined by written records.
Monitor with paper and pencil, or set up a maintenance file on your wizbang
PDA and print out a hardcopy for backup. Keep records. Documented history
is essential to continuouse indefinate use without unnecessary failures.

Record what the eyes see, the fingers feel, the nose smells, the ears hear,
over time. Adjust your maintenance schedules according to the facts
documented with the suggested schedules kept in mind. This is how you
determine the proper intervals for your vehicle the way you use it.
