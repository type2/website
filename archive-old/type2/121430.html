&gt; To answer your question:  An isolator prevents the aux battery from
&gt; draining the starting battery.  A relay will not do this.  If you leave
&gt; your key on with the engine not running the starting battery will 
&gt; charge
&gt; the aux battery on it's own until they reach equilibrium.

Only if you wire up the relay incorrectly.  I believe the stock wiring 
configuration is to use alternator output as the signal input to the 
relay, which means the relay would only close if the engine is running.
