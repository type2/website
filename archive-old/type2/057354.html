Subject: Shims, sealing rings, etc.

Just got a pair of rebuilt heads for my '81 2.0L from BusDepot, they
look good and came quick. However, one has a pair of cylinder shims and
a pair of head shims -- the other has just a pair of cylinder shims and
a note *NOT* to use head shims.
    I'm a bit confused. Don't have a Bentley for this engine, only a
Haines, but it talks about &quot;sealing rings&quot; on the heads. So is the head
shim in addition to the sealing rings from the gasket set? Seems like
that wouldn't give the greatest seal. OTOH, the earlier air-cooled
engines had no head gasket at all, and they did fine.
