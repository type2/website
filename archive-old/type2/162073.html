Subject: Re: [T2] Removing Tail Lights (78 Westy)

&gt; I'm trying to take the crumbling tail light assemblies off a 78. I can
&gt; see that the embedded bolts are held on by 4 nuts on the inside of the
&gt; engine compartment. The problem is actually getting these nuts off. I
&gt; used an 8mm wrench to get a couple of them off, but the others seem
&gt; pretty inaccessible. I can't get a socket over them because the bolts
&gt; are too long. 

You need deep well 8mm socket. I have some Taiwanese deep wells for general
work and the socket was a hair too short to reach where the nuts are
buried. I spent about $7.00 on a single socket from the higher end lines
that CarQuest Auto Parts carries (the ones that stay behind the counter)
and it worked fine. The &quot;behind the counter&quot; sockets at most FLAPS should
be similar. Measure with a ruler and check before you buy if in doubt.

&gt; Also, on the right side, do I need to remove the black
&gt; cylinder that connects to the air filter (not sure what this is...)
&gt; Did anybody else have this trouble or have any tips?

Not a clue -- I was working on a '74.
