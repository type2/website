Subject: Georgia Bus Campout September 7-8

Just a quick note to tell everyone that Peach State Transporters 
will be holding their late summer/early fall campout at Duckett 
Mill State Park on Lake Lanier this weekend.  This is a nice 
campground with the campsites directly on the lake - swim right 
from your campsite!

So bring your bus, friends, family, etc. (but if you bring your 
dog, bring a leash).  Hope to see you all there.  I will probably 
go Friday night to nab one of the best camping spaces.  :)

Dave
