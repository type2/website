Subject: Difficulty Shifting into 2ND Gear

About 20% of the time, when shifting into second gear I wind up in
fourth. Please no comments about my shifting ability. This happens
weather going from 1st or 3rd to 2nd. I suspect this problem comes from
slop in the shifter linkage. Bently doesn't say too much here, How far
can I go on refurbishing the linkage without pulling the transmission?
This is a 75 bus. I intend to change the gear lube this weekend with
gl-4, but do not expect this will have any effect on shifting
difficulty.
Thanks,
Tom
