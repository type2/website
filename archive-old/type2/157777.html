Subject: Re: [T2] Brazilian VW Bus - racist term??

Hey Y'all! Dat Robert Mann - he aint from around these
here parts. He's waaay down under where &quot;political
corectness&quot; is in itself no more than a joke about all
of us! I do suspect that Robert knows better, but I
also suspect that he doesn't comprehend how ridiculous
we have gotten about it and that some people actually
have injured their morals reading it. Lets just keep
moving along, folks and I'm sure Robert will either
ignore us on the subject (I doubt it) or add something
of the sort of an apology (...) or add something to
make it worse. That's Robert. He's over there in a
place that most of us would love to be. And you know
what they say about, well, it's kinda like if you
pronounce my sig, &quot;BaH&quot;
