&gt; I have called 3 bookstores, the library, and a friend. No one has Tom
&gt; Wilson's 'How to Rebuild your Volkswagen Air-cooled Engine.' Does anyone
&gt; have an extra copy, or know where i could find one? Maybe someone could
&gt; photocopy the important parts? Thank you.



I sell this book.  Its on the website.
