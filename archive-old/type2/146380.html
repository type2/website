&lt;FWIW, I saw Stanley brand work shoes at Pay-Less...Same company
&gt; in China probably makes both... ;-(&gt;

I'm working on a project for a local company that makes oil filters. Apparently names mean very little: Fram, Wix, John Deere, Fleetguard, and Cummins filters were all going down the same line together... All had the same insides including same number of pleats, end caps, glue, springs, etc - just different label. Guess the brand name doesn't indicate much anymore. These filters fit large diesel trucks and heavy construction equipment. Don't know if this means much but on my Honda with Honda brand filters I found a tiny manufacturer's mark on the end next to the threads. Was a DANA mark who also owns Wix. Maybe other filters also have the manufacturer's marks that will indicate different origins than what the label indicates. Will be looking next oil change.
