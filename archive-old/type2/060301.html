Subject: BUS / VANAGON Tires (Tyres?)

I may, or may not, have made an interesting discovery today.

I visited SAM'S CLUB for the first time in over 3 years, and while there I 
checked out their tire department.  After dinking around for 20 minutes trying 
to locate an actual &quot;person&quot; (now I remember why we dropped our membership) I 
dug into the tire catalogs on the missing tire person's desk and located the 
Michelin section.

After working through a few cross-references I located an entire page covering 
a single model and size of tire.  The model is XC4S, a 185R14/C size and load 
rating.  It was listed as applicable only to VW Vanagons in certain years and 
models/configurations.  None of the listings in the catalog went back any 
further than 1980, which explains why Type 2s/Transporters weren't mentioned.

The tire is described in terms that fit Transporters/Vanagons right down the 
line, has a  mildly aggressive tread design quite unlike the old &quot;X Stop&quot; and 
&quot;XZX&quot; designs, and is rated M&amp;S / &quot;All Weather&quot;.

The load capacity is given as 3,420 lbs. per axle, or 1,710 lbs. per wheel.  
Maximum inflation pressure is 55psi.

I was very tempted to simply &quot;appropriate&quot; that particular page, but us old 
folks have worn out our larcenous inclinations in the process of achieving 
advanced age.

When I got home I located the Michelin home page on the 'net and searched the 
online tire catalog.  Nothing even close to the XC4S was listed, so I sent 
them an e-mail describing what I'd found and asking for detailed information, 
pricing, etc..  In the e-mail I mentioned that a few hundred VW 
Transporter/Vanagon owners, members of an internet-connected &quot;community&quot; would 
be very interested in Michelin's response.  

If this tire is as good as it looks in the catalog we may have a winner.  Stay 
tuned.....
