&gt;     I like to also grease where the bale slides over the valve cover.  I

&gt; a bear on my 78,

Mike Benthin said he uses a brake spoon,,, 

So far I have heard  different tools of choice for doing this job..
and i guess the T1 engine is easier to get at the covers than the T4 

What is your favorite tool to remove rocker covers?

On the T4 engine I use a pry bar, some call it a crows foot, some call it a
heeled pry bar, It is about 11&quot; long and has a point at one end, and a bent foot
with a heel at the other end.. the bent end lets me lift the bale over the
detent bumps in the cover , then the point end to walk it the rest of the way
off 
I use the bent end to replace it, till it is lifted up part way,, then i change
to pry using the other end against the rocker cover, and the bale..to pop it up
the rest of the way
I usually use a hammer to tap the cover forward and back a little to ensure it
is seated
I forgot this tapping check twice now, and it has haunted me 2 miles down the
road
