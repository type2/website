Subject: [T2] Can this Carburator Be Saved?
Content-Disposition: inline

&gt;The 71 I just acquired had a bunch of tape around the carburetor (Solex 34
&gt;pict 3). Naturally, I took the tape off to see why it was there. Bingo, this
&gt;round piece about the size of a dime came falling off the carburetor!
&gt;So, is there any safe way to reattach this, or do I need a new carb?
&gt;Sue

Sue, Sounds like this might be leftovers from your 1971 emissions set-up -
either
a dashpot or throttle valve positioner. You might have some luck sealing it up
with
a dime and some appropriate adhesive. My friend sealed his with a dime and it
worked well, but it still had some of the hardware attached.If you can't seal it
up, you should buy a new carb, or have a solex rebushed and rebuilt.
