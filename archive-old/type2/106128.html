Subject: Re: [T2] Silver socket wattage

It,s not a 12 volt, it's for the
&quot;shore power&quot; plug in
from the outside, the breaker
shuts it off

what's weird about page 9 is the
3 bulb flourecent light, that was only
on euro models.


And Richard, go to page 9. It shows the circuit breaker area on USA Westies.
We never had a 12v outlet there.
Sounds like something that was added. [I put a cigar lighter socket in my
fridge panel on my 77 Westy, it is
direct to the aux battery.]
