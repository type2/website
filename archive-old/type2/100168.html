Subject: w8cc plugs?

Richard wrote to me:
 
&gt;From what I've read the best plugs are copper and have only one &gt;electrode.

That's what these are.

&gt;According to this page, it's the right plug to use which is why I &gt;put it in:
&gt;http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm#B7679

I did check out that page, but it conflicts with the Bentley and with Doktor Tim, which makes me have trouble sleeping at night.

&gt;Steve Dolan told me he runs W8CC in Virginia all year long.  Where &gt;has he got to lately?

Good question!

&gt;See this library article to see how the numbers fall into the range:
&gt;http://type2_dot_com/library/electrip/spabos.htm

Looked at this page too, but neither this one, nor J. Thompson's article say what the difference is between the plugs....
