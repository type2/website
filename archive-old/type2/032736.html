Subject: Re: DRAG LINK: NYLOCK NUTS

physicshelp_at_rocketmail_dot_com WROTE:

&gt;Don't be afraid of these nylon locking nuts, they...
&gt;they are actually more reliable than the cotter pin kind...

No way, as in never will be more reliable than nut and cotter-pin

Been at VW's Porsche's, Audi's since 1967 and NEVER seen a castled nut with
cotter-pin come loose. I HAVE seen NEW NYLOCK NUTS COME LOOSE!!!

And not just once. But to me once would be unacceptable!!!
