&gt; Didn't the Bricklin come with a mid engine 351 FOMCO in it Anthony??

&gt; I blew one of these Bow Wow's off in my  73 LT-1 Vette back in 74--75.
&gt; The guy thought he really had something--
&gt;
&gt; Neat looking car---but slower than molasses in January.
&gt;
A brief history of Malcolm Bricklin enterprises:

Imports Subaru 360's, a micro car with a motor-
cycle engine that Consumer Reports calls &quot;the
most dangerous car sold in America&quot;...

The famous gullwing &quot;Bricklin&quot;...After getting
Canadian financing, a few are built but many
quality problems finally sink it...

After Fiat decides to stop selling cars in America,
Bricklin imports X1/9's under the &quot;Bertone&quot; badge
and the Spyder as a &quot;Pininfarina&quot;...

The infamous Yugo is imported and sold in America.
Based on a Fiat, but built in Yugoslavia for lower
labor costs, the Yugo lacked even Fiat's quality
control...
Bricklin is/maybe trying to bring the Yugo back as the
ZMW - Zastava Motor Works. BMW is not amused...

The Chery is a local car company (to China...)
Bricklin is currently attempting to bring them to
America...Chevy is not amused...
