Subject:        WCM Satisfaction?


I am _thinking_ of getting some WCM rubber for my 65 Westfalia bus =
(primarily=20
because I would be buying it from a guy that is selling it at 50% the =
going rate :)

However I recall people posting to the list about their dissatisfaction =
w/ WCM=20
(&quot;hardness&quot; of rubber the  fit/finish etc.)

I know that people have been unhappy w/ WCM windshield seals but what =
about=20
front door seals?If I get this rubber it will include the &quot;deluxe&quot; (i.e. =
everything) kit for=20
the front doors as well as the grey &quot;rubber&quot; that goes around the cargo =
doors.

Anyone's thoughts on the fit/finish/quality etc. of the cargo door =
rubber or any of=20
the rubber that WC sells for the fron doors would be appreciated!
