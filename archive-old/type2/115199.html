. I swear I put it all back

&gt;just the way I found it when I R&amp;Red the engine. The last person to touch 
&gt;my
&gt;cv's was a mechanic in Orlando, when I needed them fixed up on the road. He
&gt;wasn't really oozing scruples...

They are easy to loose.
&gt;
&gt;So anyhoo, BD lists the bolts, but no spacers or washers. Does anyone know
&gt;if the dealer would have these? Are the spacers necessary (I can probably
&gt;answer that myself)?

I bought a set of washers and a couple of spacers from my local VW dealer a 
few years back. They had to order them from the warehouse and they came in 
the next week.
