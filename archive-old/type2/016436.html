Yes, Bob, the URL for that specific model is
http://www.espar_dot_com/htm/Specs/D1LCspec.htm

Unfortunately, I suspect that, because of those who would save us from
ourselves, it is not available in petrol-fueled configuration here in
the U.S.

However, if one were to install one of these complete, it would not be a
bad idea to use the diesel-fueled version.  I'm sure a place could be
found in the bus for a small supply tank.

I have no idea of the price of the diesel D1LC, but I'll bet it's
considerably more than your UK cost.  I considered one of these (diesel)
for my boat at one time, and the cost of components alone was in the
range of $1,700 - about 8 years ago.

Looking at Espar's dealer lists, I'm wondering how much of a price
difference one would see between those that are clearly catering to the
marine user versus the truckers.

Giff
