Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Good wipers? Buying a Thermostat?

I am planning on stopping by Halsey Automotive after work to pick up a few things, do they sell a decent wiper, any suggestions?

Where can I buy a clay bar?

I am going to try buying a thermostat from Halsey again, last time I went they wouldn't sell me anything because they said they didn't have the right thermostat for my 77 bus, I have read Ratwells directions for putting a Type 1 thermostat on the bus, so my question is, if I go in and ask for a Type 1 thermostat am I quickly and easily going to get the right thing?  I am cold and I know that the thermostat I have doesn't work.  Maybe I will call Traftons, I can go there during lunch.
