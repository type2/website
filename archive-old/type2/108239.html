Subject: Re: [T2] rear brake pad retaining pins

&gt; I'm having a terrible time getting the replacement brake pad
retaining pins/springs to go back on the rear brakes of my 71.  I've
just about come to the conclusion that the pins are too short.  I
tried and tried and tried and tried to make the new pins and springs
go on, but they just won't.  I also tried to put the old springs back
on with the new pins and that won't work either.  All I can think of
is that the new pins are too small.  Has anyone else had a similar
problem or have any tips for getting these darn things in place?


Brian
Lay the new pins next to the old ones and make sure they are the same
size.  The new springs will be longer than the old ones as the old
ones have taken a set in the compressed condition.  And make sure
you've got the brake shoes going in properly.  If the middle flange on
the brake shoe is too far away from the backing plate it will never go
together right.
