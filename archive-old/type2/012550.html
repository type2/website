&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;     This maybe long but I have to get some help here.  I bought my first
&gt;Vanagon Westy in October I think.  It is a stock 82 FI 2.0l westy camper.
&gt;It is very underpowered in my opinion.  

That is the biggest understatement of all time 8-)  Try an automatic on
for size like mine, it makes yours seem a speedster.

&gt;I am floored most of the time just to do 60-65.  I am getting only about
&gt;14MPG.  Freeway on ramps make me downshift to 3rd.  I also have a unsteady
&gt;idle of about 200RPM while at idle.  sometimes when I downshift for a corner
&gt;to 2nd &amp; give it gas, there is a hesitation.  The car just goes flat for a
&gt;second or two.

Mileage, should be a HARE better but maybe not depending on how many
miles on the thing.  With the brand new rebuild I can see 16mpg or 14
with the BA6 fired up.  I recall Sean B used to do about 14 in his stick
'81? and I did about 15 in my stick '81 with a new ultra low and ultra varied
compression AVP engine.  Floored to do 60-65 on the level?  That isn't
right, I
can push mine to at least 60 on mild grades most of the time, to 70 on the
level if I don't mine high oil temps.  The idle problem and hesitation aren't
right either.  Even though stuff looks OK I would replace the head temp
sensor 1st, and if at all possible swap out the dizzy and the AFM
independently
to see if you get an improvement with either of those if you can't get to
a dyno or don't want to pay for one.

As Rob D. alludes to the problem with the vanagon and the 2.0 engine is
it has a BAD power to weight, about a 1200 split probably.  It gets less than
100k on an engine, and is slower than sin.  Rebuild is a hairy line,
compression
and power (and not lugging it all the time) versus the extra heat of the
higher
compression.  110 all round if on a newer engine would have been a 7:1 or
so assuming about a stock cam.  That is right on the late VW reccs but isn't
enough power in a Vanagon.  I wouldn't build one less than stock again.
Steve D has one I did to stock 7.4:1 or so and he thinks it is OK power
wise but he doesn't see more than about 15-16.

I'm taking your solution myself I think, long live the baywindow, you didn't
really want that gas fridge that much did you?
