Subject: Fuel Filler Hose - Thanks
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Thanks for all your assistance in the hose situation.  Just to share, I
purchased straight 57mm fuel hose (Gates).  It does bend, but not enough to
work in this bus, so off I went to Builders Square (like Home Depot or Lowes).
There I purchased a PVC bend with an outside diameter of practically 57 mm.
Slipped in nicely to the hose.  I made the measurements, cut the hose, clamped
in the bend and, voila', a fuel filler hose for a '73 bus.  The PVC pipe is
the heavy duty stuff, not the standard you use with minor plumbing jobs.  It
is very sturdy with a highly gloss finish.  There was another acronym
following the PVC in the description but unfortunately I don't remember it
right now.  

If anyone knows any problems that I may face with this installation, please
reply.
