Dear Craig.

I'm at my local public library (my only access to Internet and e-mail 
facilities), at the moment, so I shall see what information I have when I 
get home. Hopefully, I will be able to contact you again on Sunday afternoon 
GMT.

I personally have no knowledge of the Quaiffe differential, but I should be 
able to find contact details for Autocavan, who sell them in Great Britain.

Regards.
              Nigel A. Skeet
