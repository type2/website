&gt; I believe that one of the conversions available for Type 2's was a van that
&gt; could be expanded(?) to show movies or at least public
&gt; information/instruction films.

no photos, but I did see one many years ago.  it had a rear projection
screen and showed the movies onto it from the back. the screen was inside
the rear hatch and the hatch was just raised up, unfortunately I was at a
fair where I saw it and didn't get much of a look, because the woman I was
with &quot;just wanted out of there&quot; so we were rushing.

don't know any more, or even if it was VW or homemade aftermarket setup

&gt; I have looked through my various books and never been able to find out
&gt; details of this conversion apart from the fact that it existed. Does anyone
