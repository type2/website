Subject: 78 FI 2.0lt dies at higher RPM's

20lt. fuel injected bus  runs and idles fine but as soon as it hits  about 45 
mph it dies out.
 
compression checks out fine, it looks to have new fuel pump. has also had  
complete tune-up 
 
Any thoughts to what would cause this would be appreciated.
 
Mario
