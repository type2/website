&gt;&lt;&lt;As the retailer/seller of these seat-belts, you assume some pretty
&gt;&lt;&lt;serious liability here. I can only assume from your post that you've
&gt;&lt;&lt;done none of these tests to prove the safety of these seat-belts. True?&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;False, I assume no liability for these.  You use at your own risk... These
are
&gt; made by VW not me.  If you blew a tire because
&gt;of an internal defect and it caused an accident, would you sue the company
&gt;that installed it?

&gt;&lt;&lt;As I said, it's a matter of liability. If that weren't the case, I'm
&gt;&lt;&lt;quite certain that the bigger companies (BusBoys, etc.,) would be
&gt;&lt;&lt;selling them.&gt;&gt;-------



Personally, I would probably trust new Mexican seatbelts at least as much
as, if not more than, used Vanagon ones.  The fact is, they'll both probably
hold you in place, whereas in a really horrible crash neither is likely to
save your life.  Of course, this wouldn't stop a hungry lawyer and a
grieving family from suing anyone they could get their hands on in the event
of a tragedy.  It seems that in this day and age, common sense and legal
judgements have very little in common.

I'd love to import swiveling seat bases from the UK, poptops from Germany,
or any number of other parts that I drooled over in Europe.  But frankly, a
fear of lawsuits and governmental red tape does stop me from importing some
of these items.  If someone were to be seriously injured in a crash in a bus
that had a seat swivel in it that I brought in from Germany, would they sue
the manufacturer, who has no US presence (and no US bank account), or would
they sue me?  Regardless of the lawsuit's outcome, it would cost me months
of time and hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend myself.  If someone
were to cut a hole in the roof of their bus to install an aftermarket
poptop, and not use the common sense to reinforce the roof when they did it,
and then roll their bus, would they sue me for selling them the poptop
without providing concise instructions on how to reinforce the roof?  It
goes on and on.  I can import spoilers for Vanagons, but if I import seat
cushions for them they have to be specially inspected by the DOT to ensure
that they meet safety standards.  I can import heat exchangers if I call
them heater parts, but if I call them exhaust parts they have to get EPA
approval first.  If a purely cosmetic rocker panel molding is fiberglass, it
goes through one set of governmental regulations on import; if it's metal it
goes through another.  It goes on and on.

So I won't import a stash of NOS seat upholstery I found, as much as I'd
like to.  I won't bring in those seat swivels either.  It isn't worth the
huge expense of hiring lawyers to figure out what disclaimers I'd need
everybody to sign, and what governmental hoops I'd have to jump through, to
give you new German seat upholstery for your bus and a swivel to put it on.
It just isn't worth risking my money and my baby's college fund.  It's a
real shame.  But it's reality.

In many countries, the laws are slightly different.  If a judge determines
that a lawsuit was groundless, the plaintiff is required to reimburse the
defendant for his legal costs.  This keeps people from suing when they don't
reasonably think they have a legitimate case.  For better or for worse, we
do it differently here, fearing that the risk of having to reimburse
defendants' legal costs would discourage people with legitimate gripes from
suing.  You have to be a pretty flagrant abuser of the courts, suing your
neighbors 30 or 40 times a year, to be charged with filing frivilous
lawsuits.  So everyone can, and does, sue for anything.

Of course, our laws are theoretically for our own protection.  But for
better or worse, they have one hell of an impact on the choices of products
we have here in the US, and what they cost us.  Yes, a brand new pair of
Mexican seatbelts is probably safer than a pair that was used for 15 years,
and then got rained on while sitting in a windowless bus in a junkyard for
another five years.  But then again, perhaps a lawyer could convince a court
otherwise.  Common sense takes a backseat to law.  And our freedom of choice
is often the first victim.
