Subject: [T2] setting valve clearances

Landon:
No, you should not have more than .006&quot; clearance (unless engine has
been retrofitted with sodium cooled exhausts, which are set to .008&quot;
clearance.)
Do you understand that there are 2 tdc's per cycle? 
1. TDC at end of exhaust/ beginning of intake cycles at which point both
valves will be slightly open (depressed- NO CLEARANCE), exhaust closing,
intake opening (sort of a rocking motion).
2. TDC at the end of the compression stroke/ beginning of the power
stroke at which point both valves are closed (not depressed- HAVE
CLEARANCE). This is also very near the firing point for this cylinder's
spark plug at idle.
 I find it easiest to determine  the rocking point for cylinder number
3, which is when to adjust cylinder number 1 (if in doubt, pop off the
distributor cap, make certain the rotor is pointing to the plug wire for
the cylinder you're about to adjust.
The feeler blade should have a firm, even drag between the rocker arm
and the valve tip. To check your work, try a thousandth smaller and a
thousandth larger. After a while, it'll feel right. Also, when changing
the screw setting and tightening the locknut you'll sometimes (usually)
make it worse on the first few tries. Don't despair, keep at it till
each valve clearance feels right. Many times, you'll only have to change
2 or 3 clearances, but if this step of maintenance has been missed for a
while, they'll usually all be a little tight.
When just randomly checking valve clearances, you might find one
measuring a few thousandths too much clearance. This is caused, I
believe, because the shafts slightly deflect when the other valve is
open (depressed).
A first time valve clearance job could take you 2 or 3 hours, but when
you get it done correctly, it'll idle better and be relatively free of
valve clatter noise.
Good luck,

&gt;I'm adjusting my valses on my '72 Riviera for the first time and
&gt;have a question.  I got cylinder 1 to TDC and both valves were tight, &gt;no gap at all.  I adjusted it to 0.006 and moved the engine to cylinder &gt;2 TDC.  
&gt;While adjusting them, I noticed that the one of the
&gt;valves for cylnder 1 was open and so I checked it with my feeler guage. &gt; The gap was bigger than it was when I had the cylnder at TDC.
&gt;Moving the engine back to cylnder 1 at TDC I checked the gap again
&gt;and it was 0.006, so I looked at the valves of #2 and one of them
&gt;was open farther than 0.006.

&gt;So, I'm assuming that's normal, but wanted to check with the list
&gt;to be sure.

&gt;TIA,
