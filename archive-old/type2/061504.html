Ooops that last didn't happen.

Those factory phenolic style are stock for vans with FI, should be available
from any of the mail order places, maybe local if you really really tried.
A Weber kit I picked up uses them unmodified, its runners are joined in a
casting at the head end pretty much like a regular FI runner.  I typically
reuse the phenolic ones in a pinch if they aren't too beat up, there are two
styles one with paper gasket on both sides of the phenolic and the paper
usually tears off on ghe heads and runners, other has graffoil, a sort of
greyish pounded carbon foil, they last pretty much indefinitely but do loose
their squish.  Either way if you have a set to reuse I find an ever so light
coat of your favorite non hardening black gasket goo will pretty much make
them reuseable at least once maybe twice in a pinch.  I'm not real sure what
dual carb T4's came with, seems the full engine gasket kits might have some
extra thick paper only gaskets but I'm not real sure, a well cut by hand
gasket with an X-acto out of a thick gasket stock with thin coat of goo on
both sides would be AOK as well as long as it doesn't affect the other end
of the tubes too much if they needed the thickness from the phenolic.
