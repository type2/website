&gt; What I forgot to say (and thanks, guys, for catching this!) is *not* to turn

&gt; 
&gt; I still stand by the stopping every hour or so, tho... just don't stop the 
&gt; engine until it's cooled down!!!  

through some trial and error I found my engine (78 2L, FI)runs coolest at
about 50-55MPH even cooler than just standing still at idle.  So on the
hot days when I am trucking on the interstate I will drop down to 55 for
about 10 minutes every hour or so.
