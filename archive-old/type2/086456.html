Subject: Re: [T2] Gaskets on the head of a VW motor (was: Should I buy?)




&gt;/&gt; On T4 head gaskets, when you get a set of rebuilt heads, you will
usually
&gt; get two sets of gaskets that are different diameters.  One pair is to seal
&gt; the head to the cylinder, the other is a shim that goes between the base
&gt; of the cylinder and the case to make up for material that was removed from
&gt; the inside of the head during flycutting.

I am referring to the Type 4 engine

This is the way things used to be.  Since the early 90's VW has done this a
different way.  You use only a barrel shim on the bottom of the
cylinder...and se no head gasket or sealing ring in the head itself. None.
VW found that this gasket did not help seal the chamber at all, but it
warped when heads got hot and caused leaks.
