&gt; Okay, can someone tell me how the heater air and fresh air is routed behind

&gt; I know that the heat comes from the engine and through the long tube where a
&gt; portion can be routed to the rear floor vent. The rest of the air goes over
&gt; the front axle and up the tube up front where I have a lever. What does this

&gt; lever do? Where does the air go past this point? Are the fresh air vents a
&gt; totally different disconnected system of ducts?

yes, different set of ducts
