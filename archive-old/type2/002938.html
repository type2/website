ORIGINAL POST:-
&gt;&gt;This is our first post.  Six months ago we purchased a 1970 Type II
&gt;&gt;1600CC Kombi Camper from some English backpackers in &gt;&gt;Cairns, Australia
&gt;&gt;and our heart was stolen - we are now dedicated VW lovers

HA-HAR!

Revenge _at_ last. British Back-packers, WITH VW campers, in Australia! About
time too!

(You have to live here in the UK to understand, or do they get every-where?
Must only be 2 people left between 19 &amp; 30 yrs in all of OZ!)

Tell me, had they thrashed the nuts off it &amp; left traces of spliff?

I didn't find mine till a trip to France, on the way back &amp; being a VW (UK
Customs officers see's us all as drug running retrogrades) we get stopped
driving through Customs. I smugly expect to get no problems, as I don't
indulge in the &quot;Wacky-Baccy&quot;. Sniffer dogs go absolutely APE-SH*T!, van is
torn limb from limb, until they find 1 solitary butt end behind the fridge.
Result? £100 fine &amp; formal caution! Grrr,

Hope your van brings lots of joy, but look for secret compartments stashed
with Tea!
