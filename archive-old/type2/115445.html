Subject: Re: [T2] Overhead Consoles

&quot;I mounted an Audiovox flip-down LCD-TV between the front seats on
Itch ('69 Westy). A Lasonics 8090 CD/DVD player fits nicely between
the &quot;roof&quot; and the pop-top. The wiring between the DVD player and
the LCD-TV &quot;sneaks&quot; along the driver's side tent base, down the
front-left corner of the sunroof opening, and into the &quot;ceiling&quot;,
coming down thru the ceiling panel where appropriate for the LCD-TV.
All very stealth.&quot;

Got pics?
