&gt;WOW

Mr. Collie has been removed from the list and banned permanently. In
addition, if we learn that he has been sending UBE to the addresses he has
so proudly harvested, we will work with his service provider to have his
account cancelled (at _at_home, which is admirably cooperative at nuking
spammers, this usually involves the forfeiture of a substantial setup fee).

This is in addition to the seven (count 'em) people who have got themselves
moderated in the past 48 hours for posting twaddle with no information
content and the three who have been unsubscribed (but not banned ) as a
shot across the bow.

I believe maybe they have put something in the WATER. In any case it is
really irritating to have to spend all this time at babysitting lately. I
know my own record is not spotless but really, &quot;legitimate bus content&quot; is
not a difficult phrase to understand IMO. Please cut it out.
