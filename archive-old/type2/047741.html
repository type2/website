Subject: [T2] Costco's Kirkland Tires - Any experiences?

Hi All:

At the risk of another tire thread, I have to ask this question. Does anyone
have experience with Costco's Kirkland tires on their bus? I recently
purchased a set of their LT195/75R14 Load Range C tires for my 71 Westy and
they seem to make the vehicle terribly unstable, much more so than the
passenger car tires that were in use before. The wind sway is far worse and
makes it very hard to control the bus. Nothing else has changed on the bus
and I'm running proper pressures (40/45 front/rear), KYB shocks, good
steering system, etc.

I couldn't find any specific info in the Archives or Tire FAQ so if anyone
has direct experience with these tires I'd be appreciate it being passed
along. These are a two-ply sidewall tire and I'm especially curious to see
how they compare to the Yokohama Y-356, which I believe is also a two-ply
sidewall.

Many thanks.
