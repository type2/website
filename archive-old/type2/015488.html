Subject: Cross Country Tranny
Mime-Version: 1.0

Driving coast to coast anytime soon?? Evaluate that tranny before you leave.

Check your maintenance schedule. How long has it been since you've seen
what the tranny lube looked like?? Last checked CV's for slack??? Preparing
for 2500 miles travel away from home mostly in parts you don't want parts
to break down at is different than preparing for 10 mile commutes from home
base for the next 6 months. But I'm sure you knew that.

Fact. A serviced but aged tranny can be function nominal with nothing more
than sleight weapage, lube changed recently with no evidence of other than
normal hair, and reach it's service life and fail in a few thousand miles,
within the distance of a cross country trip. Frankly, that is the natural
death of a maintained T-II tranny at 200k to 300k miles, depending mostly
upon whether you shift gently with light foot on the throttle or force the
syncros a bit with more right foot poundage. 

If you rebuilt the tranny within the last 100k, no worries, unless you
bought a Californicated special. How do you know?? If the ad was full page
and multi colored with an amazingly low price, that's it. But if, as so
many of us, you have no maintenance history back to original PO, you don't
know if the speedo is telling you 70k or 170k or 270k, or if the speedo has
been replaced. Some of these T-II's don't need their first tranny till they
are 30 years old. They were reasonable maintained most of their life, even
if you don't have the history to prove it.

I evaluate these old original undocumented bulldog trannies thus. We
talkin' natual weapage here. Weapage of the lube past the seals and seams,
not leakage. It wicks out over the case slowly over time. It takes several
years from new to cover most of the case with a thin film. Dirt adheres to
it. If the lube weapage/dirt layer all over the case has built up more than
10mm thick, consider reman before taking off cross country or you may be
disappointed with results short of your destination. If it's 5mm thick it
should be no worries if it has had the lube changed from time to time
(history), and the proper spec lube every time it was changed (history). If
the lower gears sycros will take a quick shift with no clash, that's a very
good indication of a basically good tranny. Let those syncros take a breath
between gears for normal driving and they will last MUCH longer. Quick
shifting is for rare testing only, unless your dialed in at less than 25
seconds at the drag strip. 

Leakage is not a problem as long as it is monitored and topped up as
required, unless adding a pint from time to mile is considered more hassle
that the cost of a reman now. Before you buy any T-II candidate, do observe
the thickness of the grunge on the tranny case. It's a quick rule of thumb
for remaining tranny life speculations when no factual history is
documented, the usual case. And definately service that tranny if it hasn't
been done in recent memory before you head out on a long range holiday or
multi-state run from the law.
