Subject: New York Area bus club

Happy Friday list,
    Calling all bus owners in the Long Island, New York area.  I'd
like to take this opportunity to tell you about the Bus Alliance, a
club for those interested in VW buses of any year or generation.
    While most of our active members live on Long Island, that doesn't
mean that you can't join if you don't.  We have an active e-mail list
at http://autos.groups.yahoo_dot_com/group/busalliance/   that you can
subscribe to and a monthly meeting at the Spartan diner in
Farmingdale.  For the past 3 years we've sponsored a campout called
LiMBO on Long Island, which is open to any and all buses.  A fair
number of our members also use their buses to travel to other campouts
and shows here on the east coast.  There are no dues or other member
requirements, although an interest in buses would seem logical.
    Consider this your personal invitation to join us.  Whether you
drive a spliitie, bay, vanagon or eurovan you are welcome,  our
members have them all.  If you enjoy camping, showing your VW or just
using it as a daily driver you'll be in good company.  Join the e-mail
list and then send a message introducing yourself.  Then join us on
the first Monday of any month for our diner meeting, if you can.  Hope
to see you soon.
