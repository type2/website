Subject: My new bus
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

My search for the perfect bus has ended. I purchased a '71 Westy today. It
is said to have a &quot;perfect interior&quot;, childs cot, rear screen,and a few
other accessories. It is white with no major rust although there are 3
places that need attention. New tires and the front end seems tight. The
only problem is that the engine is blown.

I have a friend who has SalemVWs in Salem, VA. Mark Dearing, the owner, has
30 plus years in building Vw's. He is putting together a 1641 with
counter-weighted crank, balanced pistons, rods, clutch and flywheel.New
heads with slightly larger valves. Stock dizzy ,carb and a header
exhaust.Any comments, suggestions, or opinions would be greatly appreciated.

To all those who have helped in my search for a '71- a great big THANK YOU.
I will return all pictures ASAP.

The adventure of it all is that I have never seen this bus or any pictures.
It was bought on the strength of friends trust and a very low price. The
karma is good. I'm excited. Build time is about a month. I can't wait- I
hate being busless. No more.
