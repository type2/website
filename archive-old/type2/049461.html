Subject: [T2] RE: Heaters, burning bus festival

Ceramic heaters thread, questions about gas heaters:

Gas heaters only draw a few amps. The only noise is the fan, and
a quite roar of the fire which you won't hear over the engine.
They use about 1 litre of fuel per hour at -25F. Much less in
warmer temperatures. 
They have separate combustion chambers with an exhaust pipe 
like a furnace(they are a furnace) so there is no chance of 
poisonous gases unless the thing has rusted out just like 
your home furnace.

Electric heaters won't work. You only have a few hundred watts to spare. 
Try heating your bus standing still at -20 with a 100 watt light bulb. 
Now imagine 60MPH of extra windchill, and air leakage.

Burning Bus Festival thread: 

The AFM stops the fuel ? - only after the engine stops!
Just because it is on fire doesn't mean it stops!
I drove almost a mile with a burning engine - had to find a safe place to
stop.

Dr. Tim has the best point yet. 
The best fire fighting system in the world 
is a system that prevents the fire from starting. 
Spend the money replacing your fuel lines regularly. 
Speaking of which mine are 5 years old again??????
I've never heard of a bus catching fire that didn't involve old fuel hoses 
breaking, or the brass fuel inlet pipe falling out of the carb???
Fix it first, and don't worry about Halon systems.
