Subject: Re: [T2] 6 rib trans into 74 bus.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;even more of a concern is that you want to put this in an auto tranny
&gt;bus.  there are significant differences between the buses, it can and has
&gt;been done, but it is not a bolt in fit..
&gt;
&gt;the auto tranny body does not have anything for the clutch, the shift mech
&gt;is different. even the accelerator linkages are different.  also I believe
&gt;there are slight differences in the tranny mount.

  While we're on tranny's, I injured myself and need to put an auto in 
my 68.  I talked to one guy who says he can do it, but he's in AZ.  I'm 
in CA, and no one seems to do that kind of conversion here.  Any thoughts?

TIA
