Dana-
How much material did you take off the OD of the clutch disc hub?  How did
you do it?  Was yours a Sachs?  Mine are, both pp and clutch.

&gt;Jeff this is exactly the problem I discovered with my new PP and Disk
&gt;installation. My symptoms were vehicle trying to move with clutch pedal
&gt;depressed and in gear.  It turned out my new Sachs disk was not machined on
&gt;the outside of the hub so it could slide into the hole in the PP without
&gt;contact.  I &quot;adjusted&quot; that myself and the problem went away. I don't know
&gt;the specs for the outside of the hub but it should not contact PP hole.
