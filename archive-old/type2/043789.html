Subject: Re: [T2] Here we go again: Glowing red light

You hit the nail right on the head.  Bad ground at one of many places,
corroded wire connectors, etc.   Slow process to clean, but do one light
assy. each weekend for a while and you will have it cured.....Very possible
the ground wire for the rear lights that grounds in the engine compartment.
Gets gooey in there sometimes.

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt; The subject line tells all.  I have read all the archives and gotten
&gt; some great info but...
&gt; I am stumped.  The red light in my '70 westy used to glow all the time
&gt; at night with the lights on. I replaced the generator with a Super 75
&gt; by Kymco and deleted the possibilities of a faulty generator and
&gt; regulator.  Now the light only glows when the turn signals, and brakes
&gt; are applied.  My guess is a bad ground, but I am a clueless math
&gt; teacher.  What do you all think?  Thanks
&gt;
