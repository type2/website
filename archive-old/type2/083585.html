Subject: kadron tuning

I just rebuilt my dual kadron carbs on my 74 1.8. I
have been tweeking with them and I got it running,
then last night I got it idleing right. It sounds good
just sitting there, but when I try to drive it flames 
start shooting out the left carb, and it dies
immediatly. How do you tune these things right? I do
not own a sycronizer currently so I just want it
running good enough to get to the shop about a mile
away. There is a screw in a recess on the front in a
recess near the top, a screw on the right side near
the bottom the is at an angle, and one on the right
side near the top that has an 8mm head with a hole in
it. Which screws do what? What might be causing it to
die?
Thanks,
Tyler
