&gt; &gt; if you are &quot;buying it back&quot; from the insurance company you will probably get

&gt;
&gt; Since this is just a financial transaction with the insurance company, you
&gt; still have the same title you've always had.  The check you get from the
&gt; insurance company is just smaller since they deducted what they
&gt; considered the &quot;salvage value&quot; from the total.

George,

This varies tremendously by state!  It is very local and something that
each individual should inquire about locally.  Some states require a
salvage (or other name implying really bad prior damage) as a cunsumer
protection, others do not.  The threshholds vary as well.  If you have a
bus &quot;totalled&quot; inquire locally before you sign anything!
