Subject: 74 Rust Free Bus in CA for $80?

Hey guys,

    I'm scanning eBay for parts for my Bus, and came across this:

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/74-volkswagen-bus-parts-car-bug-transporter-vw
_W0QQcmdZViewItemQQcategoryZ6783QQihZ019QQitemZ8072580807QQrdZ1

It's a 1974 VW Bus and from the pictures, it looks like it's rust free. Just
thought I'd post this. There are no bids and it's only at $80 bucks. I'd hate
to see a perfect shell like this get crushed.


Todd
