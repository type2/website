&gt; Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; Well, while this is accurate and technically true, I know that EVERY
&gt; single automotive editor and publisher in the business will continue
&gt; to use the vernacular (motor) instead of the technically-correct term
&gt; of engine.
&gt; 
And in the land of the mother tongue, one &quot;motors about&quot;; one does
not &quot;engine about&quot;...Which leads to the famous quote from the Prince
of Darkness, Joseph Lucas...&quot;A true gentleman does not motor about
after dark.&quot;
