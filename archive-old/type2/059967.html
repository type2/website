Subject: oil pump cover gasket

Yesterday, I was installing the oil pump on a 1600DP case that I'm
rebuilding as a 1776.  From the vast supply of gaskets that I've
accumulated during previous rebuilds, I picked out about five that had the
correct shape for the cover-to-pump gasket. Thicknesses of these gaskets
ranged from 0.004&quot;  to 0.020&quot;.

I have never seen a spec on this.  Bentley says the end play of the gears -
measured from top of gear to face of pump body - should not exceed 0.004,
presumably to insure that enough oil pressure is present.  Given the
extreme range of gasket thicknesses,  the  total gap between top of gears
and inside face of pump cover can vary a lot.

What is the correct gasket to use here?

Thanks, Jack
