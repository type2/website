Subject: Re: [T2] Tight Motor

If this is a recent rebuild ........... watch the oil pressure
carefyully. I've found two recent engines with mis-aligned pins on #3
main bearing. Its an engine killer, about 5,000 miles and you're done
for. Next be sure that there is a spacer ar A/C pulley between the fan
and the hub. Other than that it could be crank shaft end play not
properly set.

 Any suggestions on what it could be? I do plan to re-build this 
motor, but want to know what to watch for.
