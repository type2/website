Subject: Re: New Dakota Digital CHT Gauge Installed - Temp &amp; Mixture
  Questions

Normal on my VDO CHT gauge is 350F on the open road (a bit higher uphill) 
and 300F or thereabouts around town. I like to have the gauge up a couple 
of notches before driving away b/c I don't have the flaps/thermostat (don't 
tell anyone!).

As I understand it, you should just get used to what is a normal operating 
temperature for your engine and watch for aberrations.
