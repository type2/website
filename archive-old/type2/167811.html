&gt;
&gt;&quot;If webbing-grabbers are so effective,
&gt;why doesn't the government make
&gt;them compulsory when older cars'
&gt;seatbelts wear out?


	This joker is the same one who condemns the T2 as a mere 
'lifestyle choice', not a practical vehicle.  I view him as a mixed 
bag.
	But thanx for notifying us that there are improved versions 
of 'inertial' belts.  I hadn't known this.
