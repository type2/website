Joe,
All paint, be it automotive, or house paint is actually oil
based.(excluding latex)
The only difference is, house paint lacks the flow characteristics, uv
inhibitors, and driers.

If you go ahead and blow this SW, house paint on your bus, the tack-up
time is so long, you best have a vacuum chamber to have it dry in, for
if you don't, the bus will be so full of bugs and dust, it will look
like a &quot;Chea Pet.&quot;

Maybe K-tel, or who ever makes the Chea stuff, is missing the boat!

Perhaps the Chea-Bus will be a new Christmas time fad !!

Cool !!----Go for it !! :&gt;)
(LOL!)

Later,
