Subject: Gas Heater: Q's and BN2 fuel pumps required

First off, a couple questions about BN2 gas heaters:

1.  What type of switch turns on the gas heater?  Is is a simple on/off switch?
    Does the switch have a thermostat in it?

2.  Does the fuel pump meter the gas?

Now, I need some stuff:

I now have 5 BN2 gas heaters, and 1 fuel pump.  I don't know if the fuel 
pump is functional.  

I need at least 3 functional units (no, not all for my '66 bus, altho...)
and I'm hoping to piece them together from the units I have.

Any info, leads would be greatly appreciated.

We are planning to drive to Florida in Febuary, from Ontario.  Brrrr.....
