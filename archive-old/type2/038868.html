Hi Karl!  You wrote.. 
&gt; The correct box will be
&gt;  the same level as the seats. Both boxes have the same side dimensions: 11
&gt;  1/2&quot; x 13&quot;.

Hmmm... My 77's box was shorter than the seat, and it came from the factory 
like that...

I'm wondering if maybe VW or Westy had different vendors for these, and they 
used different dimentions?

Anyway, I wish I had the trash bucket.  *That'd* be cool.  Also, I lost the 
tabletop that goes on the pole next to the sink (Thrown away by an ambitious 
garage cleaner post-split up), so eventually I'll be looking for one of these 
as well!
