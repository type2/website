Subject: Re: [T2] headlight useage question

Greg,

Good point!...wonder how much shorter though?

My life might be worth $10.00 a year instead of $10.00
every 4-5 years if it saves me from hitting something.
I can't remember the last time I actually had a sealed beam bulb burn 
out....but, I guess I don't do much driving at night either.

I might have to hook an old one up to a battery with a charger on it
with both hi and low burning and see how long it runs...or if it self 
destructs due to heat...

Thanks, dave

&gt; Hi Dave,

&gt; Bulb life might suffer as well, I wouldn't think that the bulbs would 
&gt; be designed for extended use with double the current and heat running 
&gt; through them.
