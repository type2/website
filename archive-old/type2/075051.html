&gt; does the f.i. system need to be removed as specified in bentley? not

&gt; &amp;4 fuel rail.

On my 79 2 liter I just removed/reinstalled no i didn't have to remove
any of the fi system. I disconnected the fuel lines on the trany side of
the engine tin. then removed the other electrical lines connected and
voila pulled it right out of there. I was able to keep the engine as a
whole together untill on the stand. of course YMMV

&gt; 
&gt; also: cable from ECU - 12 inches out two disconnected wires with female
&gt; tabs split off the harness. any idea? note, vehicle is a january 75 bus
&gt; with quite possibly 77 or later fuel injection (7 prong AFM). not right off
&gt; finding thermo-time switch for cold-start valve. BIGthanks     - steve

I looked at mine (i know different years) and i have one split off wire
from the ECU brain that goes to the coil. hope this helps.
