Subject: Re: Torsion arm removal

Now that I've got the arms off what should I be looking for as far as damage to 
indicate that an arm might need to be replaced, everything look a ok to me. The 
bus has been apart for some time now and I don't remember there being much of a 
problem with the front end although I didn't drive it very much because it's 
top speed was only 40mph.
