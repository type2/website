Hi all

I recently purchased a heater fan from J.C. Whitney.

Installation was pretty easy. I located it towards the very front
of the long heater tube under the bus. Some have cardboard
duct under your feet, but not my 71'. A power saw with a 
metal cutting blade cuts hack saw time by a bunch, but
I think a &quot;sawzall&quot; would be the perfect tool for cutting
the metal tube.

I also am pulling power from my defunct rear window
defroster. I would have liked to get to the fuse box, but
my hands are too big, my eyes are too old and my body
won't contort that way any more.

I discarded the original cover (asbestos lined?) and opted
for a combination or self-adhesive water pipe insulation,
nasa insulation and then a final layer of aluminum tape
to add strength and rigidity.

I did a quick test drive this evening and its miraculous.
My windshield defrosted before I even moved. Heat,
glorious heat, was being blown on my feet while I 
putzed along in our mild rush hour traffic here, going 
about 35 mph.

One downside: I noticed a slight glow from my GEN light.
Off it when I shut off the fan.
One other downside: Sounds like a Hoover vacuum. The
heater duct act as a sound tube. Turning up the stereo
a wee bit more seemed to work, though.

$78 and change delivered to my door, about another
$20 in insulation, install was accomplished over
a lazy weekend with beer. Could have been a one day
project easy if you really know what you're doing.

Well worth the investment in my opinion.

Pete
