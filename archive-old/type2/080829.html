   Hi All.=20

    Just got the 1700cc engine top end done and installed. Now I'm =
having probs:(

  I tried to start it last night but wasn't getting gas to the =
carbs.(mech pump)
I disconnected at the pump inlet.....No Gas! Before adding gas to the =
tank I thought I
might as well replace the fuel lines from the tank to the filter. Pulled =
it off at the tank and I got a nice gas bath! Plugged fuel line!? =
Replaced the lines and buttoned it up.

This am I fired it up for the first run up. Started good and after =
adjusting timing and idle and checking dwell I go to take it for a spin. =
Slight hesitation in first gear, shift to 2nd and It's like hitting a =
wall! I feather the gas but the engine doesn't want to take it.=20
If I floor it, it sounds like it will back fire through the carbs. Can =
only get about 15-20mph in second.  don't know what to proceed with. =
Shit in the fuel tank?
I've never had a rusty tank prob before and the fuel filter looks clean =
too.

Please Help!

Thanks
