Subject: IC-706 Mk II G in Casper
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Finally jumped in and bought a new ICOM IC-706 to install in Casper,
http://www.icomamerica_dot_com/index.html
and have come up with some really great ideas on the installation.

What really looks like it might work out well is the many options I 
have for installing the remote faceplate of the radio. It would fit 
just perfect in the VW bus dashboard  where a normal radio installs, 
but, of course, then I lose the depth of my righteous tunes from my 
boom box sound; so necessary for us old hippy bus drivers.

For one thing, I discovered that the faceplate for my ashtray is bolted 
to the ash tray assembly on nut, affixed to a bolt coming out of the 
back of the ash tray faceplate.

So............
If you can envision this (pictures later) .............
The faceplate of the ash tray is affixed to the ash tray slide assembly 
by one small nut.
Removing that small nut allows me to remove the ash tray faceplate, 
bolt the radio faceplate mount in it's place, and then have the radio 
faceplate available right at my finger tips, looking as though it was 
designed to be there all along.

This will place the radio faceplate almost as perfectly as possible, 
and even will allow me to bend necessary hardware so as to tilt the 
view of the faceplate right towards me as I drive down the road.

The main radio box is small enough that it can be installed in so many 
places such that my making the optimal choice almost becomes an n 
factorial selection process.

Am hoping to install this week as best I can given our Houston heat.
Maybe I can get some pictures up soon on how I make out.

Also, maybe one of these guys to go in the back of the bus next:
