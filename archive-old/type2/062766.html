Dean,

As an ex-tire mechanic, make sure the wheel brgs don't have any play etc.
Most older steel wheels are not perfectly true.  If want to go that
route, get some alloys.  We used to use a 5 lb sledge to 'true' up steel
wheels to an acceptable tolerance.  8-)  14&quot; bus wheels are fairly common.
If you have some extras, try them for trueness while bolted to a drum.
Use a 'bad' one for a spare if you're short on rims.
