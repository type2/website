&gt;  My turn signals on my 73 camper don't work.  The only thing is that my 
&gt;  emergency flashers do work.  I don't know why one would work and not the 
&gt;  other.  This problem has been going on for a long time. It used to be if 
my 
&gt;  turn signals wouldn't work that I could turn my emergency flashers on and 
&gt;  then off and my turn signals would work again, but now it even quit that.  
&gt;  Any suggestions?  Also my bus won't start (again) and it doesn't even make 
a 
&gt; 
&gt;  clicking or a clunking or a thud when I turn the key.  If I listen very 
&gt;  carefully it makes a very quite sort of buzzing noise, but thats all.  It 
&gt;  can't be the battery because the radio works, and the lights all come on.  
&gt; Is 
&gt;  it my starter?

Hi Amelia,
The two problems could well be related, as the things you describe as not 
working are all ignition controlled.

After disconnecting the battery (VERY IMPORTANT) undo the screws that hold 
the steering column onto the flat part that goes back under the dashboard, 
swing the column to the side and examine the wires going to the ignition 
switch.

VW placed a metal tag on the end of the wire which is inserted into a metal 
ring on the end onf the ignition switch. The ring is then squashed to make 
the connection, and its possible that one of these connections has come 
loose. If so just resquash the metal ring - which should be possible in situ 
- otherwise you will need to remove the electrical end of the ignition switch 
and solder the connection.

On my old 73 I once had a complete electrical failure of all ignition 
controlled electric's due to this happening.

Good luck
