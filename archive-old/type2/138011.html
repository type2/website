Subject: Re: [T2] Paint color?

Yes, but it has to be an exact color. I'll essentially be painting the 
whole bus three times: once to change the color, once (per section) 
each time I do some work, and once at the end. The final color could be 
slightly different from the first two &quot;coats,&quot; but they have to match. 
I'll probably buy all of that all at once, blend it, and re-can half. 
(Since I have everything I need to paint with a good paint gun, I 
probably won't rattle-can it.)
