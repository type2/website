Subject: Re: [T2] 75 FI Vac Lines

&gt; A couple questions about vac line routing on a 75 FI Bus

&gt; 1. Where should the vac line(s) from the press relief valve go?

Do you mean the fuel pressure regulator? On the right front corner of the engine, forward of #1?
It gets manifold vacuum. But normally, the manifold vacuum nipple is on the right side of the plenum, above
intake runners 1 + 2.

&gt; 2. There is a small vac port on the manifold right beside the brake booster line what should this be
attached too?

I cannot picture this one..... sounds like it may go to the EGR valve, but that should be ported vacuum, not
manifold vacuum.

&gt; 3. There are two vac ports on the throttle body - one by the firewall and one just under the idle screw -
what should be going to these?

The one by the firewall is ported vacuum. It goes to outer nipple on the dist vacuum unit, the advance side,
and is tee'd to the EEC valve on the back of the air cleaner.
The one below the idle screw is dedicated manifold vacuum that only goes to the inner nipple on the dist
vacuum unit, the retard side.

&gt; The diagrams available are slightly different from the 75 - want to confirm as bus is running extremely
rich -

May be caused by no vacuum to the fuel pressure regulator and the pressure is too high or you have an open
circuit in your cylinder head temp sensor.
