Volks,
Next month going to take the Westy to Niagara Falls........_dot_can anyone
recommend good, cheap, quiet camp grounds nearby?

Also, after spending a day or so there, would like to go into Canada and
camp...put have no info about up there.   Figure my money might go farther,
and show the wife a little Canuck hospitality!!

I do not want to venture too far into Canada, maybe a hundred  miles or a
little more, but looking for peace and quiet, maybe a little fishing for
Northern Pike, etc.   Any one with recommendations and/or personal
experiences would be helpful.
