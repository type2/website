&gt;I went out Junkyarding yesterday. I found EIGHT busses in one yard

&gt;going to get the bumpers from a ’72 for my bus at $35 bucks a pop.
&gt;Is that a good price?

If they're straight, put on a poker face, be cautious of offering less and
blowing the deal if the owner is Japanese and don't like his time wasted,
pays your money, take 'em home and paint 'em, and take note of all T-II's
and how few have straight bumpers.

If they're not straight, not worth that much to me. Half that much? No.
Half 'that' much? No. Half that.........................
