&gt; &gt;Here's what I think about AAA: to put it politely, they suck.  Unless your
&gt; vehicle isn't properly maintained, you'll pay less over the long run if you
&gt; take care of your towing needs in cash.
&gt; 
&gt; That's always been my policy, so we dropped it when we got married.
&gt; Though I've been reconsidering after going exclusively air cooled vw,
&gt; with the long trip to BBB alone this weekend getting me thinking about
&gt; it again.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; What's better, using the cash method,
&gt; you'll be at the bottom of the list when you call for a tow, *and* you won't
&gt; get left stranded in the middle of the night by someone who couldn't care 
&gt; one
&gt; iota less sitting in a call center somewhere thousands of miles away.
&gt; (Anyone with an &quot;AAA showed up in 10 minutes and towed me 150 miles for free
&gt; even though they didn't have to&quot; story, speak up now!)
&gt; 
&gt; I think it depends on the contracting tow station. Ours was fast. But
&gt; when I told the driver the owner's manual called for it to be towed on
&gt; a car carrier,  he said it would move it to the front wheels when he
&gt; got off the freeway. When I got home I found the odometer rolled back
&gt; 180 miles.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for reminding me not to get AAA! I need to think ahead and
&gt; print out AIRS before I travel....

Hello Guys  Sorry but I disagree    Thje first tow will cover your cost , 
also you get better discounts on motels and rental cars thur AAA  than say ARP  
ask this old fa*t how he knows  The problem is the over mile tows then there 
will be crooks. Also they will not pick up your car unless you are with it . But 
as much traveling as I do I'll keep AAA   Use the AIRS list first then AAA    
later and have fun  Mark Dearing
