Subject: I need a stock Solex PICT 32/34 Carb (passenger side)

Anyone have an extra one for sale or know were I might find one of these (Bus 
Depot only has a Weber dual-to-single carb conversion kit)? It's the stock, 
passenger-side carb for a 1973, 1700 cc bay.

I pulled both carbs last August and put new carb kits into them, but the 
passenger side carb leaks gas (a slow drip from the bowl) and has a steady 
drip (about three drops per second from the brass tube (whatever it's called 
-- I'm a computer tech, not a mechanic :) that sprays gas into the carb) 
while the engine is running. I'm not sure if there is any way to fix this. I 
figured out something was wrong with the carb after I noticed that my oil 
level was going up. Yes...I did an oil change  :)

Speaking of the carb conversion kit, would there be any benefit to switching 
to a single carb? I've heard that single carb engines are hard to start when 
it's really cold because of the long intakes...thanks.
