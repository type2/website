Karen It sounds like you have a leak in the fuel pump. I would bet money 
that if you replace it your leaks will stop along with the gas i oil smell. 
Don't forget to change that oil. If and when you buy a new pump, make sure 
that you have the correct push rod length for the new one. I ruined a brand 
new pump installing the wrong rod that was too long.

Good Luck,

Michael Knight



&gt;From: &quot;Karen I. Eblen&quot; So my bus is a 1969 with stock 1600 and everything 
&gt;is the same except for a 009 distributor.  Was my daily driver from 1987 to 
&gt;1997, then was having trouble with the idle (drives and dies) and was 
&gt;leaking from the small circular ?? (Yikes, I don't know what it is) near 
&gt;the base of the fuel pump. After being stored for 5 years  I just recently 
&gt;towed her from Texas to Boulder, CO and having checked the valves, plugs, 
&gt;points and other simple maintenance stuff, it still has the same leak (of 
&gt;course!).  She started right up this morning and I drove her about 10 
&gt;minutes, then to an appt, about 10 minutes, then on the way back home she 
&gt;died when I let off the gas.  Also, when I check the oil it smells a bit of 
&gt;gasoline.  OK I am getting to my point-- I don't have the tools and knowhow 
&gt;to change my fuel pump and have an appt. for tomorrow to take it to a 
&gt;repair shop (only guy I talked to that I trusted in a 40 mile radius), 
&gt;which is about 40 miles from my home.  I was going to have my AAA tow it 
&gt;there, but now am wondering if I'm being a &quot;wus&quot; to tow her and should 
&gt;drive her instead?  Aside from the occasional dying, could this really foul 
&gt;something else up?  Thanks a bunch for any advice.
