Let's see, you said...

Meredith,

My advice to you is to keep the Odyssey or trade it in for a larger 
late-model vehicle if you must.  With three little ones you will not have 
time to give the bus the attention it requires.  Even if you found the 
time, the bus would still be a risk.  It is an old vehicle with few modern 
safety features.  Compared to a modern vehicle like your Odyssey, it is 
relatively unreliable (even if properly maintained!  Yes!), and relatively 
unsafe.  If you must get a bus, go ahead by all means, but don't rely on it 
as your daily driver.

I will probably get flamed for saying this, oh well.

-David
