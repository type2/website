Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield Washer Switch - was pump

My question (the Bughaus picture and details are
unclear, see snip below for link) is, does this
wiper/washer switch have push-on connector that will
operate an electrical ww fluid pump when pulled
forward? I understand perfectly how the air pressure
system works (not very well!), with its hoses and such
on the switch . My bus is a '74 and I'd REALLY like to
convert to an electric pump, but not if it means
putting a momentary switch somewhere else. Any help
here?

Does anyone know the difference between these two
parts?
