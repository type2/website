Subject: Re: [T2] No 3rd gear?

Hi Tom,

It could be the linkage.

Inspect all the components.Get someone to work the shifter through the 
gears while you watch the action at the transmission nose-cone. Watch 
to see if the linkage is working properly. It may be that the sift 
coupler is worn out and getting sloppy so that it does not align the 
shifter properly. It's a $15 part that can be found almost anywhere 
since it's used on the beetle as well.

Next, loosen the safety-wired square-headed bolt on the linkage and you 
can remove the shifter coupling.  Then try shifting the bus manually. 
If it can't be shifted manually through all the gears then you do have 
a transmission problem.

If the problem is not the transmission or rear coupler, have a look at 
the front shifter plate under the stick shift.


Happy trails,
