&gt; Great shape. NO rust, couple dents.
&gt; runs well, with no leakage.
&gt; HUGE inside.

&gt; I know this is an aircooled list and I've owned
&gt; several aircooled VWs, but are wasserboxes a really
&gt; bad idea?
&gt;
&gt; if the engine goes bad, Is it possible to drop an
&gt; aircooled engine into one?

Even better, you can drop a 2.5 liter Subaru into one and already have the
cooling system, etc. set up.  165 torquey horsepower in a bus would be
quite fun!  Kennedy Engineered Products makes the installation kit and
it's even california smog legal!  I'd get it if I were you, but talk him
down to $1k first :)
