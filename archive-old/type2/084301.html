&gt; Subject: Re: [T2] engine mounts
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Is it possible to put new rubber mounts onto the engine bearer without
&gt; removing the engine on an early(removable rear valence) Bay window-TIA-Martin
&gt;
&gt; Yes it is, barely.  Loosen bolts, jack up one side, remove mount using
&gt; appropriate blue words.  Putting in the new one is a bit harder as it
&gt; isn't as beat down.

What I was describing is to take the 3 bolts off the engine so the whole carrier is free.  Then you pivot one end of the carrier back until the mount drops out.  Due to the U shape of the end of the carrier I've never been successful getting the mount out without
unbolting the whole thing from the engine.
