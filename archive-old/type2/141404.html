Subject: Re: [T2] Frapper Maps

Hi Eric,

That's a BRILLIANT idea. Then we can tie it into the PhP driven MySQL  
database we haven't got up and running yet. :-(

But it would be a lot more useful to Canadians if the maps could use  
our postal codes.

Happy trails,

&gt;
&gt; Do the Admins think it would be a good idea? I'll leave it up to your
&gt; discretion.
