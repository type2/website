Subject: generator nut backing off

i am running one of those 'made in germany' pulleys that folks like 
ispwest sell, ad am having a strange issue... which may have nothing 
to do with the pulley, but it hasn't happened before.
every so often i hear a horrible clanking rattle from the engine bay 
- thought the gen bearings were going, but it was too 'ring-y' a 
sound. finally realized that the belt was loose, and that the 
generator nut had backed off, letting the pulley halves separate and 
rattle around. tightened, and drove on. happened again recently, and 
continued off and on during a trip - had to stop every 5 miles and 
tighten :P  oddly, running at high speed sometimes 'fixes' it for 
some distance. go figure.

i'm gonna dig up a new nut to eliminate it as the prob, but i was 
wondering if anyone else had encountered this with these pulleys. or 
if there was another cause that comes to mind.....

HOPEFULLY the threads on the gen shaft aren't buggered, as that's the 
expensive answer :P :P
