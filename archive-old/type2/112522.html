Subject: Starter Grinding

My starter is grinding on my 69 and a buddy told me I could take it off and 
lube it up because it was probably sticking. I took it off (first time, really 
easy) first thing I noticed was a sticker on it that said made in Japan. Second 
was that the teeth on the gear at the very end (about 1mm) were slightly 
gnarled looking. Other than that the wire that exits the rear and atteches to 
the solenoid is a bit tattered, looks like just the shrink tubing or whatever 
it is. I did notice that the bottom nut on the starter was loose. I have not 
yet looked to see if the flywheel is damaged in any way. Any suggestions on why 
this was happening, remedies and any maintenance to perform on the starter 
while it is out.
