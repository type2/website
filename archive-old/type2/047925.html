Subject: [T2] Re: 78 Sunroof question 

Your sunroof may have stripped gears or more commonly the plastic covers on
top of the cable guides are flexing and allowing the cables to move up and
over the gear, causing the clicking sound you hear and the roof not to open.
Find a nice person on the list with access to a few sunroof buses in the
midwest or west coast and replace the worn of broken plastic covers on the
cable guides. I had this problem until I replaced mine and now it opens and
closes perfectly. The screws that hold the covers on may be stripped too...

Pop the cover off that holds the crank, pop the cables off the rear guides
and slide the roof back by hand.....check the guides and gears to see how
they are moving...it will be quite obvious....

&gt; Subject: [T2] 78 Sunroof question and gas heater removal
&gt;
&gt; I can't seem to get the sunroof on my 78 to open, when i turn the crank
&gt; it just clicks. Does this mean my sunroof is stuck or the gears inside
&gt; are stripped? If the gears are stripped, how do i go about fixing it?
&gt;
&gt; Also, I have a gas heater mounted to the underside of my bus. It doesn't
&gt; work, so i want to remove it. How would i go about doing this? I can't
&gt; find what is holding it to the body. I found the fuel lines are all
&gt; rusted too, can i just replace the metal lines from the tank through the
&gt; firewall with rubber lines? Is this safe?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance for any help.
