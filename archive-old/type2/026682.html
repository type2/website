I have rubber seals running along the inside of the windows- I'm missing the

It fits in a groove in the top piece of the window when the top piece is
off. Do RV stores sell parts for Jalousie windows? 


I completely restored my louvered windows a couple years ago.  I started by
buying a very nice unit from the salvage yard that had a broken window pane.
I completely disassembled all three units and block sanded and clear coated
all the aluminum pieces.  I could have polished them instead, but I figured
they would just get corroded again.  I also could have painted them with a
nice aluminum paint if I didn't want to go to as much trouble.

I selected the best pieces from the three windows to make the two I needed.
It is not important to assemble the pieces together matching the other parts
&gt;from the same units as they are mass produced parts.  However, I recommend
you make a drawing of how everything fits together first.  

I was able to order new gear boxes, turn knobs, the top outside
weather-strip, and the star shaped rubber strips that seal the bottom inside
of each pane out of a catalog from a local RV shop.  However, I was not able
to find the correct size of U-channel rubber that holds each glass pane in
its frame.  A local custom glass window fabricator/installer had, like, two
dozen types of U-channel, most of which were &quot;almost&quot; but not quite the
right size, so it was very frustrating.  I finally settled for black RTV
silicone.  I used several little pieces of the original U-channel rubber to
hold the glass in the frames correctly until the silicone hardened and then
trimmed off the excess with a razor blade.  Came out really well.  I also
was not able to locate the rubber trim that fits around the aluminum frame
on the interior, but this doesn't appear to have a practical function
anyway(?).  

To remove the original rubber strips, you have to carefully pry open the
aluminum channels on the ends as the rubber is held in by pinching the
aluminum tight around the rubber.  You might also have to cut some of the
aluminum to open up the tracks enough to slide in the new stuff.  You have
to swedge or pinch the aluminum again to lock the new rubber in, so don't
overdo the prying apart stage.   The rubber strips shrink with age, so glue
or silicone is not enough to hold them in. 

I used stainless steel pop rivets for the brackets and hinged bars that
activate the panes.  I pre-lubed them and used a piece of heavy paper
between the moving pieces to prevent the rivets from setting up too tight.
The screws are available from any hardware store. The tips of the screws
used to hold the pane frames together need to be ground down a little to
prevent them from touching the glass. After assembly, I coated the screws
with the same clear coat to lock them in and prevent rust.  

The screen  material is easy to replace, but the frames are special so be
careful with them.  I kept the extra screen as a spare.  I think the black
vinyl screening looks better than gray or the aluminum.  Use pieces of self
sticking 3M felt in key places around the screen frames to prevent rattling.
Same stuff works great for the cabinet doors too.

One thing I learned the hard way is you have to be really careful handling
the glass panes.  Tempered glass gets very brittle as it ages so it will
explode into little cubes if you use bad language around it or look at it
the wrong way.
