Subject: Re: [T2] wont go into 3-4 78 bus

Hi Ray,
    When all is  proper the shifter in the late bus is nice, 
 firm, precise and tight. (^_^). Actually it will never be
 a hurst shifter but it can be pretty firm. With your  problem 
like most any other, you need to diagnose before you fix. 
Crawl under the bus, watch the shifter shaft and shaft coming 
out of the transaxle nose cone while someone operates 
the shifter. You will soon determine if the shifter shaft
 and transaxle shaft twists to and fro as you go from reverse 
to 4th. You should be pointed in the right direction rather
 quickly. A little CV grease on the sliding surfaces/ linkage 
works wonders.    
      Having 220k, (engine swap, transaxle rebuild, transaxle replace)
on our 78 westy  I have adjusted the shifter several times I feel the bentley 
is terrible if not wrong when it comes to adjusting the shift plate
inside the bus. The haynes manual procedure works better for 
me. Keep in mind I like the bentley and have had one for
 all our audi and vw. Bentley is far better in most areas.
    Best of luck to you and your bus.

Darrell
