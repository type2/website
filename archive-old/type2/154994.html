Hi Mark,

I have that conversation sometimes... it involves a quick lesson on  
cost of ownership.

Suggestion: Instead of paying $3K down and $400/month on car  
payments, invest that $3k in a bus and put HALF the monthly payments  
into upkeep. After a year, you have $2400 to spruce up the interior  
with all new upholstery, sound system and propane or gasoline  
furnace. All the creature comforts should be attainable within that  
budget. Maybe 18 months down the line you repaint and rework the body  
as required. At month 42, you have $5K to spend on a complete new  
engine. By then you're sitting in a vehicle that has cost you $8K,  
but you have a NEW engine, good bodywork, and a nice comfy interior.  
You own it outright; no payments are due and it's already given you  
three years's service in that cost. Compare that to a $400/month SUV  
payment, you'd have 18 payments left to make and if you sell it off  
you won't get much more than those 18 payments back on it.

Modern cars &amp; vans are built to be disposable and need to be replaced  
every 8 years or so. A bus can be maintained almost indefinitely with  
a much lower upkeep cost.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
