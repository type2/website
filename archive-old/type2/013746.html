Well GM is working the hell out of nostalgia and I've seen ford do it
too. VW too when they introduced the new Beatles.
Toyota was giving small awards to people with record mileage on their
small pickup trucks.
It all comes down to *if you throw enough money at it, then you can make
it last almost forever*. The exceptions are 79-81 GM Diesel engines
converted from Olds 350 gas and Datsun 300/#000 Turbos that had a 69K
self destruct timing belt and a 7M engine overhaul, any Jaguar of any
year had bad rear mains and seals.

I  still like my Westfalia although my first car, a 1934 Ford coupe had
better ventilation and heat provisions. The 60 horsepower V8 was a great
little engine if they had just taken the distributor out of the bar
ditch.
