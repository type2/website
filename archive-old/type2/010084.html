Subject: Cheap, strong roof-rack design.
Message-Id: &lt;199907091330.IAA14172_at_ux12.cso.uiuc_dot_edu&gt;

Hello everyone,

  Awhile back I wrote the list with a question on obtaining a roof-rake,
and failing that making one.  Got a few responses - thank you - but my
father and I opted to just design our own.  We finished it last night, and
we're so proud of it that I thought I would share the design.

  Essentially, it cost us only ~$60.  We got 11 pieces of 3/4&quot;, 10 ft.
long electrical conduit, an appropriate # of bolts and nuts 17/64th's
size, on 8 ft. long 2x4, 6 1.5&quot; C-clamps, some old carpeting, 9/32th's
drill bit, 4 &quot;thing-a-ma-bob's&quot; that can attach conduit end-to-end
(sorry, can't remember name) and some screws. Also make sure to have a
conduit bender for 3/4&quot; conduit. (We had to borrow one.)

We made two 7ft long rectangles our of the conduit, standing approximately
14&quot;.  These we setup in the rain-guards on either side of the bus.  To
attach conduit together, we took those &quot;thing-a-ma-bob's&quot; and tighted two
ends of conduit together.  So, we got something looking like this:

  /-----------------------------------------\
  |                                         |
  O &lt;-- thing-a-ma-bob! ------------------&gt; O  SIDE-VIEW
  |                                         |
  \-----------------------------------------/

So, each of these are sitting in the rainguards.  The next thing we did is
attach a piece long ways, to act as a guard in the middle.  To attach it,
we flattend out the end, and rounded it around so that it could fit ove
the conduit, then we drilled through it and put a bolt and nut in.  So,
then we had two things that looked like this:

  /-----------------------------------------\
  |_________________________________________|
  O                                         O
  |                                         |
  \-----------------------------------------/

Believe it or not, it is very strong.  So, the next thing we wanted to do
was make sure that the center of the roof-rack would be supported.  So, we
decided that we would run a 2x4 longways down the roof, and we would cut
it to fit the contour of the roof, and still be relatively flat.  After it
was cut, we then cut thin slices of carpeting and attached it undernearth
the 2x4 (after we painted it white:), so that it didn't scratch the roof
up.

With this in place, we had 3 spots to fix conduit strips that would be the
base of the roof-rack.  The next thing to do was start making the conduit
crossmembers that would run from one side of the bus to the other.

So, we measured them out, flattened and rounded out the edges to that we
could fix them, then drilled and attached.  At the end of this, the aerial
view looked like this:

F /--------------------------\ &lt;-rectangles made first on a vertical view
R |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
O OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO &lt;-shaped 2x4
N |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
T \--------------------------/
     ^
     |
   conduit crossmembers

Okay, so this picture is not the best, but I'm trying.  Once we had this
all built, we had this strong roof-rack, but it wasn't attached to the
bus.  We didn't want to drive through the rain-guard, and couldn't find
any places to screw it in, so we decide to use clamps.  We bought 6
C-clamps, each 1 1/2&quot;, and fixed 3 on each side - in the front, middle and
back.  And the side with the sliding door we had to move it a little more
front than middle, but it still worked.

So, now I have a cheap, strong roof-rack.  I'm going to scan a picture of
it tonight and put it on my website, so when I do I'll send another email
with the link, and you can see it.  It looks very professional, and should
survive me trip to Alaska. :)

  Wade
