&gt; Courtney, it is possible but depends on your risk and economic 
&gt; factor. Mains
&gt; can be good but you dont know what little pieces might have worked 
&gt; their way
&gt; thru the oil galleys. The right way of course is to take it all 
&gt; apart,
&gt; inspect and mic all pieces. But sometimes when you dont have enough 
&gt; time or
&gt; money you can risk pulling p&amp;c's and replaceing rod bearings 
&gt; without
&gt; splitting the case and start saveing money to do the job right. 
&gt; Your
&gt; probably on the right track, if the noise is there at idle and goes 
&gt; away
&gt; with rpm your looking at big end bearings.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was sure I'd heard a rod knock at idle with my 1 yr old purchase 
&gt; 79
&gt; Westy,
&gt; &gt; but couldn't quite decide if it was an exhaust leak or whatever. 
&gt; Last
&gt; night,
&gt; &gt; in preparation for the Puyallup VW show, the oil was changed, and 
&gt; lo and
&gt; &gt; behold, nice big flakes (one almost 1/4&quot;) of bearing material were 
&gt; lying
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; the sump. :-( This engine had just had a top end rebuild, and the 
&gt; P.O.
&gt; dork
&gt; &gt; must have not done the bottom end. It's an automatic, so guess 
&gt; what I get
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; do this winter? What fun. :-(
&gt; &gt; Any comments, suggestions, opinions on doing this ? Any chance the 
&gt; mains
&gt; are
&gt; &gt; gonna be ok and there is a way to test them? I thought maybe I 
&gt; could luck
&gt; &gt; out and just redo the rod bearings without splitting the case? (Ha 
&gt; ha,
&gt; what
&gt; &gt; wishful thinking). Sorry guys and gals, just had to vent.
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt; Courtney
