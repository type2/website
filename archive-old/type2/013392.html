To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Everyone,

This e-mail is by way of introduction.

My name is Mariana, and my fiance Goran and I are the
new and very proud owners of a 1979 type 2 vw camper
van.  We look forward to reading about whatever
comments people have about VWs type 2s in general, and
of course 1979 motors in particular.  Any help you
provide in the future is very much appreciated, since
we are bound to have a lot of questions.

Thanks in advance,

Mariana and Goran
