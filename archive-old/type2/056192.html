Subject: Re: Converting Bread Loaf Hardtop to Pop Top
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt;In process of fulfilling 25+ year dream of having VW camper and
have been
&gt;reading this list for the past few months.  I'm considering a
'78 or '79
&gt;Westy as my ideal candidate based on their engine and interior.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;Hope this isn't blasphemy, but some
&gt;of the Westy features are must-haves (e.g. pop-top for
&gt;standing room, upper/lower berths) and others aren't (e.g.
indoor stove and
&gt;sink).  Comments supporting or diagreeing with this idea are
welcome.
&gt;
&gt;TIA

I have a 77 camper body. The sink is practically useless. The
water storage is nice but
performance of the sink is pitiful. It is nothing more than a
spittoon and garbage bin.
I tend to use a bucket for dishes, you can get water easily, and
do the dishes outside.

A camping stove works great for me also.
