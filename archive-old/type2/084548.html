&gt;Oh Yeah, they also use ea-81's in experimental
&gt;aircraft, you won't see our beloved type 4 in those.

Uh, not to start a war or anything, but... &quot;yes you will&quot;.  I was having a 
conversation offline with a listmember a couple of days ago who is putting 
a type4 in his home-built aircraft.  He provided me with references to 
others who have done the same.  And of course the type 1 engine is in many 
more.  If you want to bash the type 4, kindly do it on another list.
