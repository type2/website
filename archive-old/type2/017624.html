Bob;

I think your problem could be a plugged up PCV valve.  That's the little
device that regulates how much of the crankcase vapor is sucked back
through the intake manifold and then mixed with the incoming air fuel
mixture to be burned, hence reduced crankcase pollution.  They are
usually cheap and wont be a waste of money since it probably needed to
be changed anyhow.


original message-----------------------------------------------

I've got a nasty oil leak in the rear end of my '78 Westy's engine. I've

got nowhere to work on my bus this year, so I'm relying on a mechanic
for
major work.    :-/

He tells me my rear main oil seal is fine. He says I've got positive
pressure in my crankcase that is blowing my dipstick up and blowing oil
out of the dipstick hole. Then it runs down into the fan and gets slung
all over everywhere. When I run the engine and look, this appears to be
the case.

I had a kink in my crankcase rebreather hose. Hoping it would really be
that easy, I replaced the hose with one very kindly provided by a fellow

listee- and my leak just got worse.....................
