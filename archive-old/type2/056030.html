Subject: Engine/Tranny Compatibility

Hey Volks-
I have recently acquired a '73 Westy that is in great shape, except
the tranny is stuck in 3rd(the gear-shifter is in 2nd) and I know the
engine has seen its share of miles. With this in mind I would like to
drop a 2.0 in it, when the time comes. I am going to(probably,
hopefully) get a used tranny from a junkyard. What years should I be
searching for??? I do alot of highway driving, so I like the idea of
the later tranny's different gear ratio. Will a '76 or later tranny
bolt up to my '73 engine? and down the road bolt up to a 2.0?
I, once again, bow to the great wisdom of the almighty list ;-)
Cheers,
   -Kent
