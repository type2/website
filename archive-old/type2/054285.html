Yeah, where you at?  I'd be most interested in the trans and maybe an engine.
But if you're in Florida, it's a long drive!
However, the trans can be shipped UPS! (BTDT!)

&gt; I've got a couple of spare '77 engines lying around, with all those
&gt; weird exhaust parts, plus a set of heater boxes in respectable
&gt; condition. I also have a 77 transmission, steering box and both front
&gt; doors. I'm moving in a couple of months, and they aren't coming with me.
&gt; The dumpster seems a sad fate. Any takers?
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone confirm if the alternator and starter from a 77 will work on
&gt; a 72?
