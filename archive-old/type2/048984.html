Here in Oregon its the presence of sleeping AND kitchen/eating facilities 
(refrig/stove/sink/propane gas) that get it the RV classification, at least 
thats what they told me.  

A lot of &quot;conversion&quot; vans do not have these, thus not getting them the 
classification.

I'm sure its possible to get it registered as just about anything with some 
lies and  persistence.  So, you DO manage to get it registered as a passenger 
van in a state that really considers it an RV. What happens, then, if you get 
hit (heaven forbid) and the insurance company establishes value on a straight 
transporter model instead of a camper conversion?  We could be talking 
thousands of $$ difference.  Could you even get a stated value policy like 
State Farm offers on a westfalia/riviera/adventurewagon/ if you have it 
registered as a passenger van??

Seems to me a risky deal to save a few dollars on tabs IF it could threaten 
an insurance settlement.  There are just too many drunk/cell phone 
using/careless drivers on the roads!  A fellow out here on the &quot;wet westy&quot; 
list recently went through a real struggle with his insurance company over 
the value of his vanagon Westfalia after he got hit pretty hard.

&gt; I've seen plenty of American-made conversion vans with non-RV plates on
&gt;  them. A Westfalia or Riviera is also a conversion van, so it should be
&gt;  treated similarly
