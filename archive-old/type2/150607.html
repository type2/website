Subject: Re: [T2] Re: electrical connector corrosion

&amp;gt; My feeling: bad practice!  I don't know about latter-day VW wiring, but the
&amp;gt; earlier buses and bugs used un-tinned, stranded copper wire.  It corroded
&amp;gt; quickly inside the crimp lugs, resulting in voltage losses, especially if
&amp;gt; moisture was present.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Dim headlights made it easy to identify on-coming VWs :-((
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; It's not difficult to obtain #14 tinned, stranded wire; it's just a bit more
&amp;gt; expensive than solid, untinned.  FWIW older cars, even British cars, were wired
&amp;gt; with stranded wire -- soldered where we now see crimp-connexions.  Surely a
&amp;gt; matter of &amp;quot;value engineering&amp;quot; since the problems do not surface until a couple
&amp;gt; of years have elapsed and the warranty has timed-out.

Properly done crimp connections are airtight and are as robust as a
soldered connection. good crimpers are expensive though and usually handle
only one or few specific connector types. the typical crimper does a
mediocre job of it.
I dont think the degradation of old vw harnesses is usually the crimp
itself but the connectors corroding.
