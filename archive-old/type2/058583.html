Hmm.  My 1600SP in Itchigo, stock single vac distributer, timed at 30
degrees total, 30 Pict 3 with 112.5. 140Z air, g65 pilot, and stock (not
original..:) muffler with bad gaskets, was clocked at 68 mph on the flat,
speedo sat just at 80.  running about half throttle.  She's got a strong
little engine in her, well balanced, good compression, (but not high
compression!:) more or less properly jetted for our altitude, etc.

I've gotten her to almost 100, actual speed, but that wasnt on the
flat.........(running down a mountain with this one truck......i could
have went a hair faster, but that would have put me NEXT to the truck, as
we were swapping lanes to get around the slower traffic....i'd rather be
behind, wher i can flash him clear, then be beside him!)

later...david
