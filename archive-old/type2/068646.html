Subject: Re: The type2 mailing list members site... (map)

&gt;&gt;This site present to you the north america map, where all the members of 
&gt;&gt;the type2 mailing list are registered.
&gt;
&gt;What are the moral and ethical ramifications of &quot;outing&quot; a couple
&gt;listmembers?  We have 2 lurkers from the Sacramento area, with 2 barndoors,
&gt;a '62 double door, '67 camper, '64 21-window, '59 mango standard, etc.
&gt;amongst them, and another lurker who just didn't pipe up and say anything,
&gt;who has a '63 single cab and a SuperLagWagon camper.  And thats all within
&gt;bicycle distance from my house...
