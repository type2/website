Subject: Re: [T2] Dumb Clutch Question.

&gt; Today  went for a short drive (three miles), and on the way back it
&gt; happened again, the pedal went to the floor, and I was not able to
&gt; get into or out of gear. I pulled over, shut the van down and noticed
&gt; that suddenly I could shift into and out of gear.  Underneath the
&gt; tension on the cable was where I had adjusted it to.  I took off and
&gt; made it the 1/2 mile back home before it got hard to shift again.
&gt; When I pulled into the garage, the clutch smelt like burning hair.


Your cable is broken.  You need to replace it.  Sometimes the cable breaks
a few strands, allowing you to adjust it back to function, then breaks all
the way the second time.

Use lots of grease while installing the new cable.  This keeps it working
easily and corrosion-proofs the tube through which it passes.
