I had the very same problem with my 1970 Campmobile - definitely no disks to
warp or servo to get sick.  My VW &quot;specialist&quot; insisted that it was a warped
front drum despite the fact that all 4 drums checked out fine for
eccentricity.  This was ~1500 miles after this guy did a complete rear brake
rebuild.

I finally found a left rear brake shoe's lining had come adrift and a large
chunk of it was intermittently being trapped between the steel shoe and the
drum.  The brand new drum was gouged far beyond salvage.  And it never made
a sound that was discernible inside the bus.

&gt;&gt;  A bus that a friend of mine owned did this.  The pulsing was
inconsistent, but VERY noticable when it happened.  Turned out that the
lining on one of the rear brake shoes had freed itself from the shoe.  Most
of the lining anyways, not all, as we would have heard a grinding if all of
it had freed itself.  When braking, it (the broke away lining) would
sometimes get caught between the shoe and the drum and throw itself around
in there.  &lt;&lt;
