Subject: painting my bus

Hi, 
it's me again.  i once again again changed my mind as to the color of my
bus--i'm gonna do it white over red, and i'm wondreing if anybody knows the
name/ model number of the red and white that was originally on busses.  i'm
trying to get it as close to original as possible.  thanks, bye
