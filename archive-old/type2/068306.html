Subject: Re: Busses and horns...

Hi. Back in New Jersey I learned how to drive with one hand on the steering
wheel and the other hand on the horn button. My bus has a honkin' loud
horn; it's at least 100 db (somewhere between a jet engine and a Who
concert). Unfortunately, it is currently broken, although I didn't use it
much when it was working. I worry that I'll honk at the wrong person;
someone that has one hand on the horn and one hand on the trigger :0.
