after you remove the valve cover and check to make sure that your valves are
adjusted correctly to .006,  and the valves on that side are not all
completely closed.  Check the intake manifold where it connects to the head
on the left side.  Sounds like you have a vacuum leak.

to verify it's leaking*sucking air* -- with the engine at idle spray some
WD-40 around the manifold &amp; carburetor connections, on each connection one
at a time.  If the engine changes speeds or speeds up at a particular
connection, you found your problem......

Subject: [T2] Half my engine not working


&gt; Hello all:
&gt;
&gt; I'm a first-time VW owner, and am quickly learning all about my '71 panel
&gt; bus.  Recently, I started the engine, only to have it run for about 2
&gt; seconds, then die.  It would not start after that.  I diagnosed the
problem
&gt; as a dead condenser, and since I had some free time on my hands, decided
to
&gt; do a few &quot;upgrades&quot; to my engine.  I put in a new 009 with a Compufire
&gt; module (which is not quite as easy as advertised, I can go into this if
&gt; anyone asks), and put in a new Weber Progressive carb.  I finally got the
&gt; engine re-started, but it ran very poorly.  I can't seem to get it timed
&gt; correctly, and it runs rough until it's warmed up.  However, after it
warms,
&gt; the engine idle starts to go quite high, probably at least 2K RPM.
&gt; Yesterday at lunch, I asked a fellow employee at work, who happens to know
&gt; alot about VW's, if he could look at my engine.  Within minutes, he
&gt; diagnosed the problem as my left-side cylinders are not firing.  There's a
&gt; spark going to each of the left-side spark plugs.  I'm basically running
on
&gt; only the right-side of my engine.  Since it's been raining here in NorCal
&gt; since Tuesday night, and I don't have a covered space to work on my bus, I
&gt; may not be able to pull the left-side valve cover until the weekend.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone out there ever had this problem, and does anyone have any idea
&gt; what to look for once I take off the valve cover??
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!!
&gt;
&gt; Jim Hood
