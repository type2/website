&gt; Hi Adam
&gt; Ya gotta trust me with this one.  WHen you go to the FLAPS, buy about 6
&gt; feet of 1/4&quot; OD metal brake line, new clamps, and about a 1/4&quot; ID foot
&gt; of rubber line.  Use the rubber to make the connection to the tank, for
&gt; connections to fuel pump and filter if you have one installed.  I
&gt; realize the metal line can be a bear to work with (hint - cut the flared
&gt; ends off) but you end up with much less rubber ready to spring a leak.
&gt; Yes, you have more joints to tighten BUT the tradeoff is well worth it.

A couple of thoughts here:

1/4 inch brake line is 6.35mm in diameter, which is larger than the stock
fuel line tubing.  You should use a smaller OD tube to avoid stretching
the rubber line.

Rubber line is appropriate wherever there is going to be relative movement
between the connections.  If you use steel line in a place where it flexes
it will fail.
