Subject: solex 34 pict 3 tuning/timing

Hey bus brothers!!!!

Could anyone be of assistance in setting up the proper timing and carb
adjustment on my 71 camper?
I'm having difficulty getting the timing right in order to properly adj. the
carb.
The motor is an AD1 series which I believe is a vw factory remanufactured. So
I'm not really sure which timing to go by, for the most I can tell the book
calls for 7.5 degrees BTC. at 800 to 900 rpms
I have been following the instr. on the bypass/volume screws.and the rpms are
a bit erratic. the bus just does not seem to have the power it should, maybe I
should leave well enough alone?

Any help would be appreciated,
thanks,
