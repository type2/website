If you are like us (have limited time, limited knowledge, and 
limited space to work on your bus) get your checkbook out 
and be prepared to spend a lot getting your Westy where you 
want it. We love ours, but it has cost us dearly.  Like you, we 
are learning a lot from this site and really appreciate all
the help we have gotten from this list.

Thanks to all!

'77 Westy

Subject: Pulling the gas tank???


&gt; 
&gt;   Hello everyone.  I've been reading this list for
&gt; about a month now as I've been searching for a vw
&gt; camper and you have all provided me with a wealth of
&gt; knowledge.  This is my first post.  I just became the
&gt; proud owner of a 76 westy that's going to need a
&gt; little tlc to get roadworthy again.  Someone snagged
&gt; the gas cap and it's been sitting with the tank
&gt; exposed for about a year and a half.  How do I go
&gt; about pulling the tank to have it cleaned.  Do I need
&gt; to pull the engine?  Also this thing hasn't been
&gt; started in about two years.  Are there any seals or
&gt; anything I should change in the engine before I try to
&gt; start this thing up?  Other than oil change and
&gt; general tune up stuff.  Any help would greatly be
&gt; appreciated.  =)  Thanks in advance.
&gt; 
&gt;                    Shawn
