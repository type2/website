Subject: GL4, Redline?

Tom,

No worries...Redline is GL4.  In fact, I looked my bottle of MT-90 and it says 
specifically that it's NOT compatible with GL-5, so you're safe.  

Great stuff isn't it?  My Vanagon 091/1 shifts MUCH better in cold weather with 
the Redline &quot;cherry cough syrup.&quot;  :-)
