&gt; play again.  Is there something I can do to keep the adjustment from
&gt; loosening?  There was something in the Bentley book about this (something
&gt; about &quot;engaging the recesses of the wingnut somewhere...&quot;), but the choice

What they are refering to is on the wingnut, and the lever that the cable
pulls.

If you had the wingnut in your hand, you would see that it has a square
sort of bottom, and the whole in the lever is the same way.  This is what
keeps the nut from vibrating around.

When you adjust it, you should feel it sort of &quot;click&quot;, 4 times per full
turn.  That is the wingnut dropping back into the hole, then as you keep
turning, it lifts back out, and drops in again...Hard to describe,
really.:)


I would suggest taking a look at your cablle up near the pedal assembly,
and seeing if it is frayed, and about to break the rest of the way.:)

Unless, that is, you DONT feel the little &quot;clicks&quot;...then your nut has
rounded off to the point it may well vibrate loose.  Pull it off, and take
a look at it.  Does it look worn down? Yes?  Go to your favorite vwflaps,
and get a new one.  Same as a bug, if they look at you like your stupid.:)

Good luck!
