Subject: Re: [T2] Unknown Timing


&gt; Does anyone know the timing at idle for these distributors:

I don't have a 'tune-up book' handy but perhaps you do or someone else does.
Maybe having the year &amp; model instead of the dist. #  will help? I will list
that after each number below.

&gt; From a 412 - #0 231 172 019

Not a 412, this dist is for a 1973 411 w/1700 EA and EB engine.

&gt; From a 914 - #0 231 172 021

Yes, this one is for a 1975 914 1970cc [2.0L] engine.
