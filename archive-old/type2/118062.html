Hiya All,

I'm outta my element on this one and I need a helping hand.

I picked up a couple of old Bus horns at a recent VW show.  They were 
practically free, so what the heck, if they didn't work I could mess around (which I 
am doing!) with them.  They are both 12 volt models from (I'm guessing here) 
either a 68 or 69.  
So I wired 'em up (directly to a DC converter) - no beep.  Then I opened each 
of them up.  And now the questions.......

1.  What are the points for?  Seems to me that pressing the horn button and 
making a ground is all one needs.  So, just what do the points do?

2.  Basically a horn is just an electromagnet.  Right?  No moving parts 
(other than the vibration of the diaphragm and the above mentioned points).  So, if 
the points are cleaned why would I still get no beep?  And I reset them to a 
gap of .008.

If anybody out there with an electrical background (or anyone who has gone 
this particular route in the past) could enlighten me, I surely would be 
appreciative.

Thanks!

Mike
