&gt; Now just to make sure I'm not being dumb again, the Heat Exchangers are
&gt; their ONLY for passenger comfort right? So taking them off, shouldn't
&gt; cause any problems for the engine right?

well they also defrost the windows, and other assorted and assundry things

&gt; See, I'm going to install electric heaters/blowers off my aux. battery.

waste of time and money, forget it they don't work enough to count

&gt; So I'm thinking to remove the heat exhcangers, and have my headers

I removed my heat exchangers years ago, (but keep reading)

&gt; Ceramic coated (to keep heat down).

highly recomend you not coat them, the heat still has to go somewhhere so
it ends up in the muffler, head etc

&gt; Their ARE normal headers under the heat exchangers right?

well yes and no, there are headers INSIDE the heat exchangers, it takes
some surgery to get em out.

&gt; Or if I take off the heat exchangers will I be
&gt; left needing to find some headers that fit.

if the ones inside are ok then you should be fine with them.

&gt; Also, I see a lot of headers and mufflers for Type-1's. Will those fit
&gt; onto a Type-4?

NOpe, the heads are very different, I ended up making my headers


now the catch.  I totally removed the heat system because it was totally
rusted out, BUT I installed a gas fired heater and heating system under
the front of the van and plumbed it into the defroster and heater ducts.
