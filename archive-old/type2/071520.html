Greetings to the Esteemed List,

I was wondering if there was any kind soul out there in Listland who might be 
willing to share one of Bob Hoover's sermons with me.  I'm referring 
specifically to the one covering the making of a fuel line protector for the 
spot at which the fuel line passes through the engine tin.  I remember seeing 
this a few years ago.  I checked the Library and both George and Jerry 
(excellent articles!) make casual reference to this little device.  I believe 
lamp parts were an essential ingredient in the recipe.
At the very least, I have to change the fuel line.   It looks like it was 
last attended to during the Carter administration.  And I'd like to take care 
of that &quot;sore spot&quot; at the engine tin.

Thanks all!

Mike
