&gt;My car kept stalling on my way to school today.  When I hit the brakes,
&gt;it stalls, when I am idling it stalls, and when it is not stalling, it is
&gt;running so slow, that it is dangerous...I was having to stay around 40mph
&gt;on a 65mph highway.

It sounds to me like it's most likely a vacuum leak, possibly with the
power brake unit because of the stalling while braking.  You mentioned you
did some wiring work, so let's rule that out first.  Turn the key on and
measure the voltage at the ignition side of the coil (the set of terminals
NOT connected to the distributor).  It should be around 13 volts.  While
measuring it, have someone step on the brakes.  If the voltage drops a
little (like a volt or 2), the problem probably isn't the wiring.  If it
goes way low when the brakes are applied, then you've got something
wrong.  Most auto parts stores sell manuals made by the Haynes company
for around $12, and the manual for your bus has wiring diagrams.

If the wiring seems okay, check the vacuum hoses to the distributor, and
the big hose which runs up front to the brake booster.  For that one, you
might disconnect it and plug the fitting on the manifold and see if it
still stalls.  You can also spray WD-40 around where the carb sits on the
manifold, where the manifold joins the heads, etc.  Any change in engine
speed (up or down) indicates a vacuum leak in that area.  Be careful,
though, because of fire hazard.

Hope this helps some.
