it works well IF you get the good intake (most outfits sell the budget
intake manifold, which is fine when it's 100 degrees out, but NOT if it's
below 70). Obviously, we only sell the good one.

&gt; Has anyone ever run a Single IDF center mount on a 68-71 Bus? Is there
room
&gt; for the carb and aircleaner? Did the carb work good in the Bus? The reason
I
&gt; ask is that they are the same price as the Kadrons and you get a Weber
with
&gt; dual 40 or 44mm. The one concern I have is the hight, I do not know if
they
&gt; will hit.
