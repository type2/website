Subject: running engine with no muffler

My muffler and my heater boxes are removed for repair. While they are 
removed the bus is just sitting. I know you are supposed to periodically 
start the bus if it is just sitting. Should I start the bus and allow it to 
idle with no heater boxes or muffler, or should I just let it sit til the 
repairs are done.
(My neighbor is doing it as a favor and I'm not sure how long it will take 
him.)
Thanks,
Kyle
