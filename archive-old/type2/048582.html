Hiya Scott,

I purchased a 70 Bus just recently and one of the first things I noticed was 
that the speedo was &quot;off&quot; considerably.  Since I had monkeyed around with the 
speedo in my Bug and I had another speedo as a donor, I decided to give Bus 
speedo repair and calibration a shot.
&gt;From the get-go you need to know that there is no adjustment screw or 
anything of that sort with which to adjust one of these things.  After I got 
the little beast apart I found that the placement of the indicator needle was 
what did it.  The needle needs to be placed on the mainshaft so that it 
returns to the resting peg on the dial face, but will not go much further if 
the peg were not there.  In other words, the needle needs to rest lightly 
against the peg.
I reassembled the speedo and installed it and then tried it out against our 
local radar trap speed sign.  Dead on the money at 25, 35, 45. and 55.  I 
didn't go any faster than that in a semi-residential neighborhood.  This 
actually took about three tries to get it &quot;just so&quot;.  You'll probably need to 
do a little experimenting.  It's been a couple of months since the 
&quot;adjustment&quot; and everything is working just fine.
