One more thing-beams rust from the inside out, so while the outside may
look fine, it could be about to rust through from the inside. I don't know
of a sure way to tell if one is in this condition, although if you roll it
around you may hear bits of rust shaking around inside (and turning one of
these things around isn't easy, they are HEAVY!) How do you stop one from
rusting from the inside? My idea was to drill two small holes, one at the
top and the other at the bottom of each upright where the tubes pass
through. Plug the lower hole, and using an old pump style oil can filled
with POR 15, pump it into the cavity, remove the plug and let it drain. I
would think this should coat the inner areas and stop it from rusting
further. I thought about it, but never did it to mine. I think this should
work-any other ideas?   Jeff
