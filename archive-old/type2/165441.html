The front braket is barely enough to hold the spare tire.  Don't tickle
the dragon by asking it to do more.

If you want to carry bikes on the front, visit a trailer hitch shop.  They
can fab a removable rack that meets your needs without risking stressing
the spare tire bracket.

On my bus, the solution to all such problems is the roof rack, but on a
poptop westy that option tends to go away.
