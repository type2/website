Subject: overheating

I have noticed my engine seems to be running hot.  It is a 68 campmobile
with a 1600 in it.  I have recently switched out the vaccume advance for a
009 distributor, and had the timing adjusted correctly and the engine seems
to be running smooth, except for climbing hills.  I have also noticed an
exhaust leak right at the muffler.  Is this leak enough to cause my power
loss uphill?  I used to be able to drive up the Canyon where I live in 3rd
only going to 2nd briefly.  Now I have found myself going to 1st ad 2nd
often.  I don't know if this is related to the overheating.

As far as the overheating, my light does not come on, and the fan appears
to be working.  Granted it has been 100-105 degrees here in Colorado, but
it still seems to be running hot even at night.   I have also noticed smoke
coming out from where the oil cap goes.  It has been in a good local shop
recently, and they felt as if it was a good engine, they did a valve job,
the emisions are low- so does this overheating mean a rebuild?  An advice
on the overheating and powerloss would be appreciated.  Thanks.

David
