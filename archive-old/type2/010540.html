Hey Volks,

    I ( Yucel Kuday ) am currently restoring a 73 BUS with a poptop and I am 
looking for some interior parts. I have the bed/bench but this is all.  It 
is awfully hard to find these parts around here (south Jersey) and I am 
asking the list for help.  Maybe somebody knows of a good salvage yard near 
me (NJ&lt;NY&lt;PA&lt;DE)? I am a college student at Rowan University who is low on 
cash but will find some dough for good parts.

wish list:   Sink/IceBox/Stove
             All Cabinets
             Jumpseat?
             Table?

Peace,

Yucel Kuday
73 BUS (BAM-BAM)
74 Super Beetle (Pebbles)
