Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.9905072029290.2037-100000_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net&gt;

Well, I gotta weigh in on this, not to support or bang on Bus Depot, but
to make it clear what the list policies are.

First,  We welcome the participation of Vendors.  We *really* welcome
vendors who participate in the list discussions and are helpful.  

Second, they have to be able to stand a bit of heat, however, as one of
the genuinely open topics is complaints and kudos for and about vendors.
Not just the ones participating in the list, but all of them.  The
function of the list is to make it easier to own and drive a bus.  Good
parts, promptly and reasonably supplied are vital to that goal.  If you
are not happy, let the list know.  If you are happy, also let the list
know.  I promote the vendors I have found reliable (Bus Depot, Olympic
Auto Parts, etc.) and complain about the ones I have not found to be so.  
You should too.

Third,  one of the &quot;mortal sins&quot; in my book is an &quot;ad hominem&quot; attack
(it's latin, look it up, or ask me).  The original post was a reasoned and
accurate description of problems.  Some of the later ones were much less
so.  The statement &quot;X sent me the wrong part/shipped me a head with a
broken valve guide&quot; is something others can use to evaluate whether to
deal with a certain individual or vendor.  The statement &quot;X is a jerK&quot; is
not.  In addition, it will certainly draw my ire.

Fourth, remember that &quot;good&quot; is spelled with two &quot;o&quot;s, not one.  Everyone
is going to make mistakes occasionally.  Please try to work out the
problem with the dealer before you complain.  On the other hand, a pattern
of mistakes is a sign that there is a problem that needs attention. In the
case of delayed shipments, I know this is hard to make up, time being
irreversable (so far).

Sixth, I pray mightily that vendors will regard complaints as valuable.  
I once read, I know not where, that for every customer who complains, 9
others silently take their business elsewhere.  Now, as vocal as this
group is, I doubt the ratio is that high :-), but it is still something to
think about ( or, of course, it could be mere managementese :-)
