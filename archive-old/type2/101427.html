&gt; Bought a BN4 last spring and bench tested, got it working and
&gt; everything seemed to work just fine. I let it run and run on
&gt; the bench and had no probs, functioned as it should. Then 
&gt; after installing it, it would only run for a few mins and then
&gt; shut off. Like it wasn't getting any fuel and the safety 
&gt; features kicked in and shut her down cause of no ignition.

IANAEHE (i am not an ebaufauser heater expert) since my small
experience is with the stewart-warner brand of heaters. Hopefully some
of this will apply but not sure. When testing &amp; running the first time
did the heater cycle on and off? If not perhaps the thermostat is set
so high that it is trying to raise the temperature to such a high
degree that it simply cannot without getting so hot it trips the
safety devices. hopefully it's a simple as that.
 
&gt; I have a '76 FI westy and was wondering the best way to route 
&gt; the fuel line to the gas heater. I assumed it would not be 
&gt; wise to &quot;T&quot; into the FI ring since it is pressurized at 
&gt; 30 or so psi so I &quot;T'd&quot; into the line coming out of the tank
&gt; before the FI fuel pump, but when I tried to run the heater 
&gt; it acted as though it wasn't recieving fuel.

I hope this is ok, since I'll be doing the same thing when I finally
get around to installing mine.
