Subject: Propane conversion?

Guys,
I would like to convert my 1800 bus to LPG. I have asked everyone here in
Australia, but all mechanics said it can't be done! However, the idiot
manual says it can be done, and has referred me to IMPCO. Has anyone done
this propane conversion? Does it work OK? Apparently, you add a regulator
which is heated by either the exhaust or oil. Seems simple enough.

My primary objective is to save money, as unleaded petrol (91 Octane) is
approx. 75c/litre, and the LPG would work out to approx. 55-65% cheaper!
