Subject: Re: [T2] Mini skirts

Interesting, that looks like my number 13 then
13) buy new pistons because in my ignorance and reading Muir I destroyed one.

Grandfather would have commented &quot; the best is the enemy of the good &quot;

- Arnaud


 Are you saying that you removed material from the skirt of the piston?

yes

 Did
 you take away any of the material that would have been in contact with the
 cylinder wall?

yes the complete skirts flanges


 You can't disturb the piston skirt, that is what keeps the
 piston running straight in the cylinder. Pistons are not cylindrical, they
 are conical. The skirt of the piston is larger in diameter than the top and
 this slight cone shape helps to keep the piston from cocking inside the
 cylinder. If you cut material away from the skirt you will disturb this and
 the piston is ruined.
