&gt; 1978 2L FI Automatic Stock (this bus was bought in CA when new.)

I got a 78 2L FI auto bus
&gt; 
&gt; I recently replaced my AFM due to bad testing specs per the Bentely manual after ruling out the fuel pump as a problem, checking all the vacuum lines, adjusting the mixture,timing is correct, plugs are new.
&gt; 
&gt;  After I installed the AFM and set the mixture again, I'm having the
&gt; same exact problem.
&gt; 
&gt;  When I take my foot off of the gas pedal, or even just let up a little,
&gt;the engine just shuts off. Stop and go has just become stop and get
&gt;frustrated, then restart. It doesn't always start right away after dying
&gt; 
&gt;  Whats going on? Have we missed something? I'd really like to hear all
&gt;possibilities from you guys, then I'll rule things out one by one. I'm
&gt;hoping its some stupid little thing.

do you have the FI trouble shooting manual?? it is in the T2 library
have you checked your double relay??
I had a similar problem once and it was a broken connector on the coil?
have you checked the egr? is it still there?
have you checked your fuel filter?

hope this gets you started,
