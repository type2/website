Subject: More info on &quot;Good tire price in SFBA&quot; tires

I've had a number of people ask me for more details about the tires I 
posted yesterday.  Here are all the specs:

Size: 185R14
Load rating: C (6 ply)
Load index: 99 (1710 lbs)
Speed rating: S (112 mph)

As for the complete brand / model name / quality of ride / road noise / 
tread info, I'll snap some photos of them on Monday after they're 
installed and describe how the trip back across the Bay Bridge went 
(lots of bumps :-)
