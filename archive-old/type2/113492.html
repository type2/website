Subject: Re: [T2] friday topic..

I have a few videos that show snippets only. A whole bunch of factory VW 
and Porsche photos can be found in &quot;Excellence Was Expected&quot;, the 
definitive history of Herr Dok. Ing. Ferdinand Porsche and his sons. 
Original editions in good condition go for $100 or more. The current 3 
volume updated version is way spendy. My brother has many VW books showing 
inside factory pics, so start cruising the local book stores, or search at 
Powells_dot_com. Super service and huge inventory used and new books. Full 
downtown block, 3 stories, and several mall stores in the area of Portland, 
Oregon.

&gt;Folks,

&gt;Does anyone know of any video's that show more than just a brief snippet
&gt;of any shots inside a vw factory.
