HOWEVER I have my t-stat and the flaps are set up correctly but they are
disconected with the cable off because I do not have the stock heat system
so there are no exchangers and tin under the cyl.  the lowest piece of tin
on the engine is the &quot;forgotten&quot; piece above the push rod tubes.

without all the containment I am concerned that it won't get hot enough in
that area, moving air flow and all.  I don't have any way to effectively
test it, so I have erred on the side of caution leaving the air flow at
max.

 the heating ducts and tin were removed over 5 years ago so it hasn't been
very high on my priority but if anyone has actually performed accurate
tests without the heating system installed I would love to know how it
worked
