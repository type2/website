Subject: Alternator power output problem?

Well, I solved the bucking, missing and no turn signal problem that I
mailed about last Friday.  It was nothing more than a fuse.  (Oops)
Thanks to those of you who mailed me with suggestions.

I've noticed lately that when I turn the lights on in the evening the
engine really idles down.  I think this is normal as it idles back up
fairly quickly.  The thing that I don't think is normal is the cycling
that occurs after that.  The engine idles down and almost dies and then
idles back up again.  This cycle repeats itself until I turn off the
lights, accelerate or the engine dies.  I have my idle (RPM's) set
correctly (maybe even a bit high) so I don't think this is the problem.
I checked the alternator belt and it doesn't appear to be slipping.
Maybe a little belt dressing would help me to make sure it's not
slipping?  The voltage regulator is new so I don't think that is the
problem but I'm not sure.  Does this problem sound familiar to anyone???

As always any help will be greatly appreciated.
