Subject: Re: cops in the PNW

Must throw in my similar story.....The only time I've been pulled over in my
bus was in late 1998 on the tail end of a 4500-mile road trip to Baja
California, Mexico, and back.  After a month on the road and all the trials
&amp; tribulations of driving a bus (or any vehicle for that matter) all the way
down there, it seemed pretty funny -- after the fact, that is -- that I get
pulled over before 9AM about 15 miles south of Portland (my home at the
time) as I'm on the &quot;last leg&quot; of the trip and and nearly home.  The wind
was howling that particular November morning, and I was naturally all over
my lane on I-5 -- par for the course for a bus owner but obviously a big
deal for this state trooper, who was on me out of nowhere and had me over to
the shoulder in a jiffy -- probably licking his chops for an early-morning
DUII.  When he appeared at my window, it was obvious to me that this had to
have been his 1st or 2nd solo patrol, he was SO young; I think it was
obvious to him that I was totally sober and hadn't done anything wrong.  He
looked inside thru the window and then, he pulled out the &quot;stickers&quot; card --
told me it was a violation to have so many stickers on my rear window -- it
was obstructing my view -- and then took my license &amp; registration back to
his cruiser for a futile Wants &amp; Warrants check.  However weak his attempt
at finding a violation was, I remained friendly and patient and didn't ask
him to go into the finer points of the &quot;Sticker Law&quot; I was supposedly
violating.  This guy seemed so new on the force that I was positive he was
trying to write his first ticket or something.  Of course, he let me off
with only a warning.
