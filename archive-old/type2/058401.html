Subject: weak link in your gas lines??

Well Volks,
   I was at a gas station/Mcdonalds/supermarket last night
on my way to work again. Whilst talken to a V-Dubber in a
93 Jetta (was nice) I looked over at Gunter and noticed a
liquid leak behind the driver's side rear tire,,,hhhmmm,,
we went over to check it out and it wuz gas!
  Now I pop open the deck and dripping down from the vent
area is a nasty leak. How the heck did the gas get up there I thinks?
  Upon getting my head in there with a flashlight I see a short
length of rubber hose connecting the vapor tube from the tank to
the cooling tube that runs up into the vent-scoop area.  It wuz
leaken like crazy! I didnt even know that there was a break in this 
metal tube untill this moment. Duh!
  I toweled it up and, leaving the hatch open I ran the mile or so home
and replaced this section of hose. Although I was in one of those
super-stations, they of course dont carry anything automotive other
than oil.
  Now I have been noticeing a gas smell for awhile but have checked
all the hoses,,,or thought I had anyway. BTW the reason I saw it is
because I hand crafted a drain in the engine compartment because
my slider roof drain dumps water there. Turns out that this is right
where
this short section of hose is too. Also, if I hadnt taken the time to
talk to
the V-Dubber I would have just tooled on down the road without knowing
a bad thing was brewing!

  Moral of this story, say hi to your fellow V-Dubbers even if they
arent
in a Type II, this is how good Karma is created!
(An check this hose too! }:-[)
             Peace
