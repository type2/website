Subject: Need '77 era fuel tank part

Hey, I'm in dire need of a part from a '77 or so fuel tank (any fuel-injected year will do). It's the piece that goes at the base of the tank so fuel can be pumped from the tank or returned to the tank. Required for fuel injection, but not for earlier bays.

If anyone knows where I can order this part or if you got one you'd sell me, **please** drop me a note. My future as a mobile volksnut rests in your hands...as they type on your keyboard.

Thanks! Joe
