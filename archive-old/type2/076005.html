Kooky Math won't do, Jamie. You must use real math. The bottom line on the
time/space/money/skills/tools to do it anything like &quot;right&quot; costs far more
than the resulting value, unless you value very highly the skills learned
and acquired with lots of hours invested for the bargain. By the time you
get the motor and tranny mounts sorted, you may not have the price of a set
of spark plugs left. And the mounts will take the skills of a Shaman to do
with a great deal of custom fitting and stitching of metal.
Most Shaman qualified by experience in metals I know get $70 an hour or so.
Neither novice nor apprentice can be expected to create other than a
hodge-podge monstrosity that will not sell out well as a project in
progress, and pretty much ruins the chassis and condems it to the crusher.

A hex on backward swaps of T-IV engines into T-I motored T-II's. It is a
can of ravenous time/money/space eating worms.
