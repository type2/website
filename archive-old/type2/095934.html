Subject: exhaust and exhausted

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C2198E.52650DC0

Good evening all,
Well I finally got around to replacing my exhaust.  I pulled off the old =
muffler (this was a muffler from an earlier year) and realized that it ha=
d been leaking because the stud on the top of one side is missing and the=
 stud on the top of the other side is broken in half and the half is stuc=
k in there.  =20
So, I decided to put on the proper exhaust parts.  I put on a crossover p=
ipe which has all of the studs.  But one of the studs on the bottom is no=
t screwed into the pipe far enough.  As a result it sticks out too far an=
d hits the heater box.  So the crossover pipe cannot be pushed flush agai=
nst where it connects to the heater boxes.  Also, I can screw the bolt on=
, but not all the way because there is a break in the threads in the stud=
.
Now the exhaust is louder and smellier than before, although the bus driv=
es like it has more power.
But, the leak must go.  What can be done.  Is it cheaper to try to fix th=
e crossover pipe or the old muffler?  What is the better way to go.
I am really tired from this as I changed the canvas and the exhaust in th=
e same day.  What was I thinking.  But man that new canvas looks great.
Thanks for all your help.
Peace
Kyle
