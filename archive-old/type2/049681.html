Subject: RE: [T2] Roll backwards on a hill ??

You don't even always need the handbrake. Just let the clutch out until the 
engine begins to slow down.

I can usually hold the bus if I am careful with only this and it's plenty 
long enough to give some throttle to take off.

I have had to learn this because only my Honda will hold itself and my 
little utility trailer on a backwards roll. When I tow with my bus, I have 
to use this method.
