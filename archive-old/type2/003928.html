I've asked this on RAMVA as I somehow got unsubscribed to the list. No help
so far but one of you will know.

I've renewed the cables and flapper valves on my 79, but cant get the cables
adjusted right. If I set them so the valves are fully closed when the lever
in the cab is up in the off position, the valves won't then fully open when
the lever is pushed down to the on position.  I've been testing it with the
electric fan running on override so I don't get burned. You can feel the
draught on the flappers so you know when they're fully open or closed.

If I set them with the lever down and the valve fully open, that is no air
leaking out underneath, when the lever goes up, the flow won't shut off.

I would think one way of correcting this would be to have a shorter lever on
the flap valve. Do they in fact come in different lengths?

Another thing is that the cables dont readily slide back down the outer.
I've got some ones made of single strand solid wire. Are original VW meant
to be like this or are they multistrand?. Mine tend to bend at the cab end
when the lever goes to the off position and tries to push the cable back
down the outer.

Can anybody help?
