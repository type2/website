Subject: Re: [T2] hyd. valve adjustment question

Remove the distr. cap and turn the engine crank counterclockwise with a
7/8 wrench on the alternator belt bolt.  When the rotor points to #1
spark plug wire, you are at TDC for 1 when you line the mark on the fan
edge up with the 0 on the scale.  Loosen the nuts on the adjustors for
#1 valve rockers and unscrew the adjustors to verify they are backed off
and can TURN FREELY by 2 fingertips.  Screw in one adjustor until you
just feel it touch the valve end.  It must be screwed in further to set
the piston play  so as to not hit the snap ring when valve play is
loosest- according to Bentley, 2 turns, to others, 1.5 to one full turn
in, on the theory it will absorb more tightening due to any lengthening
of the stem or seat pounding in.  I personally use 2 turns and check it
every 20,000 mi, on the theory that a hydraulic system is designed to
have the piston in the middle of its range as to best accomodate a
lifter pumping up or loosening of the valve train say, by wear of the
adjustor end.  Hey, mine has run for about 250K mi now! To go to #2,
turn the crank counterclockwise 180 deg (if fan is not marked, do it by
measuring each side with a tape measure).
