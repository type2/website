Type 181s (VW's model number for the &quot;Thing&quot;) used the old bus =
transmission with the swing axle/reduction boxes through 1972. From 1973 =
to the end of the production, the 181 used the CV joint transmission =
from the Bug. However, the bug transmission was given a different final =
drive ratio for the 181.
