Subject: Overnight sort-of survey: Type 4 engine stands

Just to get a sense of what people with the larger engines do, I would 
appreciate hearing from listees who have rebuilt Type 4 motors. Did you 
use an engine stand to test/tweak the engine before installing? Or 
install, then start/test/tweak? Would you do it that way again?

Please reply to me, and I will post numbers and observations tomorrow.
