&gt; &gt; Until the situation arises, owners won't know.  If one goes to a VW

&gt; &gt; given.

&gt; &gt; BTW, if VW ever used a non-resistor coil, FLAME ME big time, but post
&gt; &gt; to the list to inform all.

&gt; &gt; Only vehicle I ever had with a external resistor was a Sunbeam Alpine,
&gt; 
&gt; The reason you use a resistor with a coil is so that you cut down the
&gt; voltage going into the primary windings. MY Datsun Z car has a nice
&gt; cermaic resistor (external) below the coil. It knocks down the
&gt; input voltage so
&gt; the output woltage is not too high, and does not tear up the plugs or
&gt; points as fast. When you first start up the Datsun Z, the starting switch
&gt; bypasses this resistor and feeds the the full 12volts to the coil. 

Exactly how I recall them from my early training. It feeds 12V thru the 
coil during starts to make up for the drop in voltage caused by 
cranking, then, when the starter solenoid kicks out, it feeds power 
thru the resistor, dropping voltage to around 6V. Bypassing the resistor 
will also cause the coil to run hotter, as well as shortening point 
life.

12V American cars use the same system... at least prior to electronic 
ignition. In Fords they commonly used the ceramic resistor, but many of 
the early Chrysler cars used a resistance circuit. Mechanics would get 
complaints of hard starting, so they'd ask the owner how they started 
the car. &quot;Well, I turn on the ignition, adjust the mirrors and seat, 
then start the car&quot;, was always a sign of trouble. If those cars weren't 
started in 15 seconds, it was best to turn off the ignition for a 
minute, then try again.
