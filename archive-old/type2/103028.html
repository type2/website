Subject: Re: [T2] fuel cutoff solenoid

It was just a reference in my earlier post. On my '77 2L dual carb I have
fitted a fuel pressure gauge at the carb, and the fuel cut off at the tank.
What I have noticed when turning off, the fuel pressure will rise from
3.5psi up to 12psi over 1-2min, and drop to 0 over another 3-4min. I guess
the fuel locked in the lines between the cut off and the float needle is
locked in as it heats up the pressure rises.
The big problem of course this extra pressure (3-4 times what it is intended
to see) makes the chance of a fuel line bursting/popping off MUCH more
likely, just the thing I'm trying to avoid.
