Subject: HCBF:  VW Family Feud Survey

In preparation for the VW Family Feud to be played live at this year's High 
Country Bus Festival I am now sending out the survey to all you bus owners.

Please copy and paste the questions into an EMAIL and reply to me only, not 
to the list.

One answer per question please,   try to keep answers as short as possible.  
Think back to watching the Family Feud;  when the game is played,  each 
question will begin: &quot;We surveyed 100 bus owners and asked 
them................&quot;

Have fun with it,  please remember to reply only to me and not the list.  
After the game is played live at HCBF, I will post the results of the survey
