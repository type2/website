Subject: Canvass Installation Woes

Hello All,
In the last week, there were a few of you that posted your canvass
installation woes.  I am considering having an Amish canvas shop custom make
one for my 71 HapyBus.  Is it possible that you could send me any
documentation that was included in your purchase?  I am thinking of
something like any installation instructions, and ideally measurements.
Anything like this come with your new canvas?
Thanx in advance
