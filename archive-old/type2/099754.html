&gt;engine can answer these questions: Does the crankcase have to be machined to
&gt;accept larger cylinders?

No, up to 96mm will simply slip in.

&gt; Replace the crankshaft with one that has a longer
&gt;stroke?

Yes.


&gt;How about hydraulic lifters? Is a hydraulic camshaft needed? Or just hydraulic
&gt;lifters?

The debate is in the archives, you'll have to judge for yourself.

&gt;Valve sizes?

Different, 2-liter heads have smaller valves.  Not a big deal.

&gt;Anything else?

Yes, but nothing major.  Just use 2-liter crank and rods, and 94mm pistons/cylinders.  The valvetrain is an independent decision.
