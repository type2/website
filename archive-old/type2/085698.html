Subject: Re: [T2] thermostat

From what I understand, some people remove the thermostat and flaps b/c they 
can malfunction and cause the engine to overheat.  In warm climates, people 
remove thermostat and flaps b/c they feel they don't need them to keep the 
engine warms enough. (the thermostat operates the flaps in the fan housing). 
  Having them gone however will not allow your engine to run warm enough in 
the winter, causing even more problems.  You can get a thermostat for about 
20 bucks in a parts store that sells VW stuff. Look for the flaps in a 
junkyard.

That's what I know.
