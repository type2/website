&gt; I understand your feelings about engine swaps. That's cool. We can all
&gt; have an opinion.
&gt;
&gt; #1: My frustration with some mechanical issues (notice that they're
&gt; NOT engine related, but mostly electrical, suspension, and carb
&gt; problems) nearly led to my leaving the bus community.

happens in all vehicles, so you wouldn't escape that just change it

&gt; #2: My wife asked me to keep trying.

all other reasons are surplus

&gt; #3: My wife stated that she really wanted to be able to drive the bus
&gt; when it's ready for her.

can't convince my wife to even try

&gt; #4: My wife can't drive a stick without lugging the engine badly.
&gt; She's always in a hurry to get into 4th (in the Z I had) or 5th (in
&gt; the S10 we recently sold). This is NOT a good thing with an ACVW.

so get an RPM guage and mark a green area for shifting, up/down when it
gets out of the green area.

&gt; #5: My wife has lupus. Anything that stresses her out (including
&gt; worrying about whether she is going to destroy the engine by her
&gt; driving) aggrivates the disease.

great vehicle to relax while driving

&gt; #6: I worry about her getting stranded somewhere due to #4.

get triple AAA and a good cell phone

&gt; #7: There happens to be a perfectly good Toyota engine (and car)
&gt; setting in my in-laws driveway that they were going to send to the
&gt; crusher.

send it to the crusher

&gt; #8: KEP has a kit that allows mounting of that engine to the VW
&gt; transaxle with little trouble.

famous last words

&gt; #9: I have done strange engine swaps in the past and am aware of what
&gt; is involved with mounting a non-native engine properly. I've never had
&gt; to come up with a way to put a radiator in a vehicle that didn't
&gt; originally come with one, but I've got some ideas on that. Plus KEP
&gt; has some experience in that field as well. At least I don't have to
&gt; buy a custom drive shaft for this... heh

well then take and put an auto tranny in it, next to impossible to lug or
overrev...

&gt; As you can see, there was a syncronicity of all this happening within
&gt; a 1 week period. And me being the doting husband that I am, anything
&gt; that pleases my wife pleases me.

your a well trained husband, welcome to the club

Bob
