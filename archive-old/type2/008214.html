&gt; I dripped ethanol over every (intake) joint and, sure enough, the
rpm shot up when I

seems to
&gt; indicate that the throttle shaft needs to be rebushed.  The effect
is quite
&gt; reproducible.
&gt; 
&gt; A year ago,  I was set back about a month for the same problem. 
That time,
&gt; I found a source of just the throttle plate assemblies.  Now even
these
&gt; &quot;new&quot; ones seem to be leaking.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to my venting here,  I do have a few questions:
&gt; 1. Has anyone experienced continuing intake leaks through these
shafts?

Just about everyone with an original Solex carb.

&gt; 2. If I find a shop to rebush these, can I count on the fix lasting
&gt; more than a few months?

The bushings are brass, which will be more durable than the original
metal.  Rimco is noted for doing a good job on these.

&gt; 3.  Could my symptoms be caused by something other than the shaft
&gt; bushing.

Of course!  If your test shows that the shafts are leaky then they
probably are, but that doesn't rule out other leaks.
