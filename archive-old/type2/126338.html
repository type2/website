Subject: vacuum can numbering

Hello-

I was rooting through a box of dizzys I've acquired in the past few 
years and recalled that someone on this list is a wizard at identifying 
the vacuum can by the little number on the connecting rod (which, in 
turn, is the third set of digits in the full Bosch part number).  I 
couldn't find a cross-reference source through Googling, so I brought 
my numbers here to see what you can make of 'em...

dual vac #995
single vac #2447
single vac #533

I was able to verify through the archives that my dual vac #953 is the 
07 115 (1974 MT), and my single vac #581 is the correct part (07 060) 
for my '78 MT (based on the picture of the box Richard posted a couple 
of weeks ago).  Hopefully, one of the single vac's listed above is the 
correct can (07 024) for my '69 Bug.

As to whether any of these vacuum cans are any good is another question 
entirely...

Thanks.
