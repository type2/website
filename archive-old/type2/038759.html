power (but, in my experience, gets slightly worse fuel economy) with FI. 
However, that doesn't help you much *now*.  What you have is what's
generally referred to as a &quot;weber progressive carb&quot; on the list.  It's not
a stock item, but an aftermarket retrofit.

There are only two adjustment screws on your carb.  The &quot;tweak sheet&quot; that
came with mine is 450 miles away, but if I remember right, the procedure
is something like this: 

- Adjust idle speed screw (the one on the throttle arm) to about 900 rpm.

- Turn the idle mixture screw (on the face of the carb facing the rear of
the bus) clockwise slowly until the engine rpm peaks, then turn it a
little further until the idle drops 50 rpm.  Then turn it counterclockwise
1/4 turn. 

- Re-adjust the idle speed screw.

It's been a while since I did this, so someone please correct me if my
memory is faulty.  I think this should get you in the ballpark, at least.
Incidentally, if the carb hesitates badly coming off of idle, it usually
means the idle jets are too small -- swapping them for slightly larger
ones made a big difference on mine.
