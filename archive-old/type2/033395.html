Subject: Fwd:  alternative penetrating oil

Hi,

&gt; I am &quot;allergic&quot; to WD40, Liquid Wrench, and the Wal-Mart brand spray 
&gt; lubricant.

&gt; What is another option for me to free rusty bolts?

 I don't know Liquid Wrench (I think it's a US product) but prefer a
can based liquid penetrating oil (I think my current one is from 
Holts), maybe one of those would be OK?

 Alternatively a friend recommends Diesel as a good alternative to
penetrating oil.

Cheers,
	W.
