Subject: It's cold!!
Date: Thu, 5 Nov 1998 08:30:00 -0600

Well it's finally getting cold here in Tennesse and after a hundred mile
trip yesterday, I 'bout froze.  Guess it's time to fix my heat situation. 
Couple of questions for the list......

I have an accurate oil temp gauge on my 72 and when the weather is warmer
normally runs between 180 and 210.  Yesterday it never got above 170, even
when driving a 70mph.  It has a huge oil cooler on it and a custom made air
scoop to deflect air over the cooler.  Should I wrap the cooler in
preperation for even cooler weather?

By bus came with the aux. fan in the engine compartment.  The PO had
removed to do some engine work and never reinstalled it...which knob on the
dash controls it?  I believe it runs through a relay, could I not put a
simple toggle switch and run the power direct to the fan?

Last but not least(for now :-))....the wind was blowing pretty good
yesterday and as usual my bus was all over the road.  It has good shocks
and tires though the tires are passanger.  The steering is good and tight. 
Would LT tires really make that much difference?  Would it not help if the
bus was lowered all around a little(flame suit back on)?

Thanks to all....again a very fine list!!
