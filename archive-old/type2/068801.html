Clara,

Just my $0.02,

I agree with you. I like great bodies too (no pun intended) but I really
like daily drivers too. Kudos for all you efforts!

good spirit,

tony

&gt; beautiful; well, maybe that's just me...?
&gt; 
&gt; If you keep your bus lloking like shit, you obviously don't take a great

&gt; then why do you subscribe to this list...?

&gt; first of all, I don't have a beautiful vintage bus, if you mean shiny
paint
&gt; and perfectly straight and rust free.    I have a number of somewhat
tatty
&gt; old vws.    Not a one that a non vw head would say &quot;great bus!!!!&quot; about.
&gt;    The 53 looks like it's been driven through h*ll and back, as virtually
all
&gt; the paint has been eaten off by acid rain.  I think it's beautiful.  The
65
&gt; camper, Nellie, has a b*tt ugly paint job.  I admit it.  I would rather
it be
&gt; the original velvet green and white.  Really I would.   But I decided to
save
&gt; it anyway, it was a ACSAR bus. Bugster, my indestructable, faithful,
(touch
&gt; wood) 69 bug with great heat and no rust, has a $15 rattle can job on it
from
&gt; 6 years ago when I first got it, to cover up the rattle can camo job he
came
&gt; to me with.   I do have pride for, and respect for my vws, but not enough
&gt; money to have the bodywork and paint done, yet.  The 53 will be a show
&gt; bus.... when it is done.    The 65 will need rocker repair and a bit of
dent
&gt; work and paint to LOOK nice, but I am still getting it mechanically
sound.
&gt;   I also want to get the steering lock sorted out.   (Ha, steal it now!!)
&gt;    I plan to drive it, prolly through the snow (it is snowing in Oly, WA,
&gt; right now) to California for the Christmas holidays.  Not that I would
MIND
&gt; having a nice shiny split, and would be happy to accept any donations.
&gt; 
&gt; I have never yet had anything stolen out of a car (I have only owned
&gt; aircooled vws), and I only lock them in a big city.  BTW, only 2 of the
vws I
&gt; have had (the first two) were drivable when I got them, or when Mike and
I
&gt; got them together.   
&gt; 
&gt; I subscribe to this list because I like old VWs, and like to see what
other
&gt; people have to say about them.
