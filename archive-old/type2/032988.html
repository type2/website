&gt;Should I buy larger pistons and cylinders? New high
&gt;performance exhaust system?

No, you shouldn't do that. Amos, I'm sorry, but you cannot rebuild a Type I
for $300 and have it run for more than a week--much less add dubious
&quot;performance&quot; mods to drive up the price and shorten the lifespan. I wish
you could. I wish *I* could. But it's not the case.

IMO your best bet is to beg or borrow another $800 and get the BeetleMex
longblock, which is a brand new engine made by Volkswagen of Mexico. It's
made of all new parts and it has a very low compression ratio, which means
it is less likely to overheat when driven with a lack of love. =^ )

Another possibility is a rebuilt longblock from AVP. Mr. Salmon of the Bus
Depot will tell us how much one of these costs if we but glance his way. =^

Please do not buy anything whose advertisement features a buxom young lady
in a bathing suit. It means they want to distract you, don't want you to
look too closely at their work. There's a good reason they fear exposure.

Ask if some listee who lives near you can come over and poke his finger
through your piston and tell you about the Muir book.
