Subject: Voltage stabilizer? What's that?

'78 Transporter
I'm trying to get my fuel guage hooked up, and the schematics say that one 
side should be hooked up to a voltage stabilizer. What's that? Where is it? 
What does it look like?
I have a theory that it is that small strip of metal held to the back of the 
speedo by two bolts and has two electrical poles on either side, but I cant 
say for sure..

Thanks for any help!
Dylan
