&gt;Hello all,
&gt;I am trying to locate one of the VW interior light switches.  This is a
&gt;push-pull switch that mounts on the dashboard and controls the rear interior
&gt;light in early bay-window Buses.  I'd like to get the switch and make sure
&gt;it's also got the little light icon insert in it.

I have an assortment of the same switches, knobs and inserts. They were the
same type on the early 901 series and 914 Porsches. I will check my Porsche
electrical misc. drawer and see if I don't have a fog light insert and
switch. 

&gt;
&gt;So, looking for the switch, the knob, the knob insert, and the little screw
&gt;thing that holds the switch to the dash.  Let me know what you want for it.
&gt;
&gt;Also, does anyone know where to get an externally mountable rear fog light?

Porsche, again, made a rear fog light for the 911 starting mid 80's or so.
Perfect for your application. Check with Performance Products, Automotion
or any dealer. Perhaps just a backup light from an early Bug will do? I
believe PP sells reproduction Hella 128 fog lights. That also would be
trick in the singular with yellow lens for the rear.

&gt;I haven't had a lot of luck finding them but I know they are out there.

Check the salvage yards in the area for any Euro vehicle. Bosch and Hella
have made many things for these cars that could be adapted for your use.
