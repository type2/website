Subject: Rear Bumper on 72 bus

I am the proud owner of a 72 bus, original blue and white color scheme.  I purchased this bus one year ago for the low price of $850.  I have not had any major problems mechanically with the bus and I have already been offerd 4 times what I purchased it for.  However, I am not interested in selling it because I have dreamed of owning one since I could drive.  What I need now, because i am in the process of doing the exterior renovation, and prepping it for paint, is the rear bumper.  I have one now but I do not think it is the original one...  Also it is very banged up and seems that I would be unable to straighten fully.  Thanks again and from someone that loves his bus,
          Keep Buuuuuuussssssssssssiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnn
