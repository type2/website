&gt;thanks, but i am rather broke at the moment.

If your broke, you probably won't be interested, but I did recently review
all Bosch Genunine Remanufactured distributors that are of utility for the
T-II/T-IV motor series run and found about 5 that are suitable from the
stock numbers currently available. They list from $450 to $550. Though you
pay for a reman and must return a core for value, sometimes the box has a
NEW part at the same price. Any Bosch Authorized Parts Spezialist can
supply them. I sell them for 15% off list at the rate of less than one per
year servicing 200 or so vehicles, the vast majority having their original
Bosch distributors from the factory still function nominal.

Just did a nice custom rebuild of a very spezial Westy T-IV motor. Early
replacement case with provision for the stock dual carb mechanical fuel
pump, 2.0 liter, solid lifters, balanced to the max with Webber 40 IDF's
28mm venturies. I fired it up, checked and set initial timing. Set the
motor to run at 2500 rpm for initial running in, then rechecked the timing
off idle. Timing is jumping around willy-nilly from 20 to 30°. 

I shut it down and informed the client that breaking in this motor with
this distributor is unwise. That's when I did the research on a
replacement. This particular distributor was a stock housing no. with the
vacuum can and point plate removed and an 009 or similar point plate
replacement with aftermarket electronic trigger. He went searching for
something used with the numbers and references I gave him. This is going to
be one of the fastest 72 Westies on the road with little sacrifice to
reliability, depending on how heavy a mass is applied with the right
footsy.   

As an aside, just found out this week that Bosch has evidently abandoned
the idea of supplying parts for the earlier CIS systems. The last fuel
distributor I ordered was a coupla years ago for a Rabbit. It retailed for
$500 or so. Looked up the current cost on same for an early Volvo. $2200
compared to a dealer price of $650. Those are current list prices. And not
just the Volvo, ALL the CIS cars fuel distributors were near or above
$2000. Those I could sell at 25% off, but still not rationally marketable
at that price unless it's a very high value Porsche or Mercedes and the
dealer goes NLA.  

What amazes me is the fact that in servicing many hundreds of Bosch CIS
vehicles, I have only replaced three fuel distributors. One from
contamination from sitting too long, one from contamination due to a
non-Bosch filter and one for plunger sticking from wear. In the case of
contamination, you also MUST replace the warm-up regulator which is
constanly swapping fuel with the fuel distributor or you risk instant
recontamination of the NEW fuel distributor. OUCH!!!! Not good on cost per
mile ratios. Not spending enough time/money to do the job right in this
case can have a very steep downside. No less so than breaking in that new
engine with a wholly out of spec non-stock ignition distributor.
