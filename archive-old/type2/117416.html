&gt; I'm undoing a mess the PO left behind on my 1977 Auto Sunroof when he 
&gt; converted it to a single weber, replacing its messed-up engine with a 
&gt; 2L VW of Canada reman pre-configured with '75 FI.
&gt; 
&gt; The starter occasionally refuses to engage, but if I wait a few minutes 
&gt; it will be fine. The starter wiring from the key is intermittent at 
&gt; best so I have a jumper wire from the battery that I use to start the 
&gt; bus. Once I have the engine running I will resolve this.
&gt; 
&gt; I have replaced the weber's low-pressure electric fuel pump with a 
&gt; stock FI pump from a 75 westy. The pump gets voltage temporarily when 
&gt; the starter is engaged but as soon as the starter is disengaged the 
&gt; test light goes out. Wiring the pump direct to the coil gets me a nice 
&gt; flow of gas at the cold-start valve connection, so I know the pump is 
&gt; good. All the fuel lines are brand new. I checked injector #4 and it is 
&gt; delivering a nice spray pattern. The double-relay tests OK according to 
&gt; Bentley.

there is a double relay that controls the Fuel pump, the starter engages
the double relay until the engine starts and then it shuts off and the AFM
triggers the relay to keep the pump running.  it appears that your double
relay is not triggering the fuel pump when the engine is running.

double relay is usually mounted on the firewall abovee the #3 cyl  quick
check, with ignitiion on slide a pencil into the AFM and slightly push the
flapper in there, as soon as it moves the fuel pump should start...if it
doesn't there is a problem in that circuit...
