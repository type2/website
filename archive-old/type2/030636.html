&gt; i have a 72 sunroof, but no seal at all....i have tried the archives and the
&gt; bus depot but couldnt find anything on the subject, (or a seal) can someone
&gt; explain to me how the thing seals up?and where i can find whatever it is

Sure.  Whadaya need to know?:)  It's basically a double size bug/rabbit/a2
golf/audi/volvo roof.  All mechanically similar.

The seal?  I dont know if the bus-specific seal is available anymore, but
I suspect one could use 2 or so rabbit seals (all of the above roofs, even
some BMWs, use virtually the same seal.  assuming metal panels, of
course...up till the late 80's early ninetys)  

I havent had opportunity to look a a bus roof close, so I may be wrong on
the seal.  It is possible it is a bit thicker, but I doubt it.  

To replace the seal, you will need to remove the panel.  see the bentley!

Once on the table, be careful about scratches!  Lay it on a thick blanket.
And also be careful about warping the panel.

To install the seal, once you have cleaned up the lip very well, you will
need to run a medium bead of silicone alone the inner edge of the lip.
the seal will then slip onto the panel.  It's obvious once you have one in
your hand..:)

Try to put your seams towards the front of each side.  About 1/3 front the
front is fine.

When you install the seal, resist the temptation to pull, and stretch the
seal.  You need to compress it back into itself on the panel.  If you dont
compress it, you'll get a gap at the seams in a few weeks.  When it comes
time to cut the seal, leave ~1/4 inch or so extra that you can work in.

Be careful about the silicone, to keep it on the inner edge of the lip,
not on the bottom or outside edge (the bottom will be towards you!).  this
helps to keep it from getting all over the outside of the panel, and
whatever you are laying it on (from where it will spread....:)


Flip it over when your done, and make sure it is leval all around.  May
require a bit of fiddling to get it done right.

A panel this big, you may wish to silicone a few feet, then work the seal
on, silicone more.....

Before installing the panel, let the silicone cure fully.  A few hours
should be good, overnight would be great.   Be sure you clean it up while
it is still wet, though!:)


Once you have the panel back on the bus, you may find that the seal makes
it to tight to slide through the opening properly.  Get the panel seated
in the opening properly, and leave it for 4-5 days, without opening it.
this will let the seal break in, and fit properly.

Note that these seals DO NOT seal out all water.  Internal sliding roofs
just cant do that.  So you have a pan into which the water runs.  Then it
drains out your draintubes....if your tubes are clogged, you'll get
leaks......

i digress.  If you are uncomfortable doing this yourself, find a good
sunroof shop.  (I can suggest one in the Augusta GA/SC area....:)


good luck!
