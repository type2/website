&gt; Need help......
&gt; Tried many things but to no avail.
&gt; Bus won't start unless I pour fuel into the top of the carb!!
&gt; so far:
&gt; Replaced fuel pump
&gt; Replaced plugs, leads, contacts, condenser, distributor cap, rotor arm...
&gt; Replaced auto choke
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is only evident on cold start.  Once used, the bus will start
&gt; all day, stopping for up to 6 hours.  After that...more fuel in the top of
&gt; the carb.  Outside temperatures here during the day vary from + 15 celcius
&gt; down to 0 celcius.  Nothing too outrageous.
&gt; 
&gt; Bus is a 1975 bay window, 1600cc no mods, Solex Pict 34 carb.
&gt; Anybody got any ideas?

Could be gummed up needle valve in the carb.  I don't know the history,
but if it sat for a while that is a definite possibility.  It happened
to me, and once the fuel pump got up enough pressure, which it wouldn't
do during cranking, it would force the needle valve open, filling the
float bowl, then it would work OK until it sat for a while, gumming up
again.  Cleaning out the carb did it for me.  

Also could be that the carb is emptying out for some reason, like too
hot or a leak around the drain plug on the left (FIF) side.  You might
never see a leak if it's slow and the gas evaporates as fast as it
leaks.  

HTH.  :&lt;)
