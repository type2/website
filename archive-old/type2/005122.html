When Mr Whipy (who will be renamed with a new colour scheme) goes back on
the road, I would like to fit a MPH Speedo since my KPH one is a bit off &amp;
I'm fed up with all the mental calculations for speed cameras. With a baby
weeks away, I cant afford much. But anyone with one in their parts bin going
spare would be doing me a GREAT favour.
