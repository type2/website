Subject: Squeak, squeak cure?

Howdy -
I have been noticing a distinct *squeak* sound from the front end of my 
'80 lately. The sound is definitely related to vertical movement of 
the front end.  I can wiggle in my seat at a stop and hear it. While
doing a front disc replacement yesterday I was able to locate a
culprit.  The anti-sway bar goes through a rubber bushing as do
other bits and pieces of the suspension system.  I can see black 
residue (rubber?) next to where the metal bar goes through the rubber 
on a small portion of the bushing.

Query: What nasty things are happening and what can one do about?

Thanks all.
