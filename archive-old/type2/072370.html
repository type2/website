Hey aaron.
check w/ elmar at streetsboroforeignauto_dot_com, he's the guy to talk to 
here in NE Ohio.

todd.

&gt;     I'm looking for a good used tranny (three rib) to put in my '70 
&gt;Sportsmobile.  I've been able to locate one in Oshkosh, WI, but I'm 
&gt;in NE Ohio.  The cost of shipping something so heavy isn't too 
&gt;feasible for me.  I travel to most all the shows in the area, MI, 
&gt;PA, OH, etc.  Maybe if you have one we could hook up at a show?  All 
&gt;the local shops won't sell me a used one, just a rebuilt unit with a 
&gt;rebuilt price tag.  As far as junkyards...  Finding a bus in a 
&gt;junkyard around here is next to impossible and if you do find one, 
&gt;some Buggy guy already got to the tranny.  Let me know if you can 
&gt;help.
