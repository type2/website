Subject: --- where are you living??? ---

Hi everybody!

I am making a map of North-America to locate all the members of the type2 
list. I will put this map on the www.

I hope you think it's good idea. I hope you want to help me!

I want to know:

Where you live: State, city, and a nearest big city (to help me locate 
you on a map!)
What is you van: year, model
What is your name:
What is the name of your van:
What is the URL for your home page: (if you have some)

Do you think I can answer how old are you?? Or it's not appropriate?? :-O 
Tell me!

And give me your suggestion!!
