&gt;&gt; &gt;I will accept the flack on this...... You don't need no stinking second
&gt;&gt; &gt;solenoid. Its a patch not a fix.
&gt;&gt; &gt;------------------------------
&gt;&gt; Just as the relay kits are a panacea for old wires.
&gt;&gt; Wires/terms/switches/solinoids/armatures/brushes/bearings get resistant
&gt;&gt; with age, just like us. &quot;click-click&quot; for start is many times a synergy of
&gt;&gt; weaknesses throughout the circuit.  The closer you are to stock, the better
&gt;
&gt;and then there is the one that drives you nuts!? 
&gt;
&gt;about the only thing that keeps me from being stranded is the &quot;mechanic's
&gt;bump switch&quot; I mounted in the engine compartment 

Consistant with DM. My 912 Porsche came from the factory with an insulated
but loose connector in the motor compartment that is just long enough to
jump a terminal on the regulator for maintenance and emergerncies. An
axillary starter solinoid provision from the factory. Very handy, indeed.
Way better idea than cutting a hole in your dash for a button.

&gt;it appears to be a voltage drop because when it doesn't start or crank you
&gt;can hear the starter sort of hum a little.

Then just confirm the circuit with your multimeter. Check drop across batt
+ and big bolt solinoid, then solinoid to switch, then through switch, then
back to small terminal at the solinoid, then to ground through the
solinoid. Anyplace your dropping more than 0.2v is weakness adding to the
problem. Just do the voltage drops with a trustworthy meter.
