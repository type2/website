Subject: Will it fit??

Out of necessity (and a little bit of cheepnis) we drove the '72 Bus to a
major appliance store for a new fridge.  I took the middle seat out before
we left home and Diane took the Squareback so we'd all (2 kids) have a way
to get home.

We ended up picking out a 25 cf side by side floor model.  As the loading
guys hauled it out on the dolly I said - &quot;Here's your challenge for the day
- it's going in that bus!&quot;  They didn't seemed impressed....

I had to remove the rear seat as well, but fortunately the Squareback was
there to bring them home.  The guys still didn't think it would fit.  But
with unfailing confidence on my part, we  pushed, lifted and twisted the
huge appliance inside the bus.

So, save that $30 delivery fee and take it with you in your bus!
