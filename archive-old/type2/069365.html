Subject: battery problem

I think I broke my deep cycle battery.

Last year, I bought (used) a deep cycle battery and added it to my bus.

Late last year I broke my engine and the battery sat, discharged, all through
a very cold winter, in the bus, outside.

This year, the battery isn't doing much.  Voltage never gets very high,
and current is very low.

Does anyone know of any way to get this guy a little more active?
Would jarring the battery do anything?  A blast of juice?

Thanks,
...Markus
