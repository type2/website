Volks,

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.... I used to hang with a guy
who did a lot of scuba diving.  That was back when powder-coating was
first coming in to fashion.  Now scuba tanks take a *lot* of abuse and
are very subject to rust (dipping metal in salt water occasionally is not
recommended!)  As a result, the divers were at the front of the line to
get their tanks powder coated!   The problem is that those same tanks
thereafter displayed a disturbing habit of exploding when being refilled.

Part of the process of powder coating is the heat cure.  This *may* have
negative effects on pressure vessels!!!!  I would advise that you *NOT*
have your porpane tank powder coated!  If you do/have, I advise that you
take it in and have it tested.  I am not sure the materials are the same
between scuba and propane tanks, and I am quite sure that the pressures in
a propane tank are much lower, but I would still have it tested!

&gt; The powder coater charges $40 per hour. She said they could do about 15-16 
&gt; wheels per hours - same $40. Take this into consideration is you have other 
&gt; parts that can be done in the same color. New color = new hour = another 
&gt; $40. I powder coated two sets of wheels, some trailer fenders, and a couple 
&gt; of misc. things at one time. Did the same with my black items - trailer 
&gt; parts, 

&gt; propane tank,
