Subject: Re: Getting Crushed

My shop teacher, on the first day of class (my junior year of H.S.) showed us a
video.  It was Faces of Death, and he wasn't supposed to show it to us because
it's banned in the US or something.  It showed in graphic detail what happens
to your legs when you don't use a jackstand.  The man in the video used two
tire rims on gravel to hold the car up.  TIRE RIMS ARE NOT MADE TO STACK!!!
The backing plate of the car he was working on neatly cut his leg off just
below the knee.

    Also, those little jacks you buy at sears or valu or any other &quot;fine&quot; tool
store, are not very good to use.  Go online, search for used tools, and get
yourself an old truck jack.  I've used one all my life, and my dad before me.
He had the seals replaced before I was born.  It's a heftier, and longer
version of the sears brand one.  I wouldn't think of lifting a car without one.

    just a little ramble.  go shop safety, go.

&gt;
&gt; I have heard of so people who have removed one wheel to adjust brakes or
&gt; change wheels while the vehicle is only on a jack.  Then while they are
&gt; sitting on the ground with their legs stretched out under the vehicle only
&gt; to have the jack slip off and the vehicle come crashing down crushing their
&gt; legs.
