&gt; Hey Folks,
&gt;     While driving down Route 1 yesterday from Baltimore to Washington DC I spotted a late 70's Bay which I believe to be a Riviera, it certainly wasn't a Westy. The place is called &quot;Crazy Rays, and it is right on route 1 in Jessup, MD. I stopped, and asked if it was available for parts, and was told no, it runs and was for sale whole. When I asked if I could take a closer look at it the said &quot;I don't know&quot; and disappeared into the back. I didn't have time to wait, so I went out and walked by it, has the usual cancer in the rockers and dog legs, but not the worst I've ever seen. The interior looked &quot;OK&quot; from what I could see, which wasn't much. If it really does run, and the front beam isn't bad, easily worth a grand-BUT, I have no idea what they want for it. Also, be forewarned these did mot appear to be the friendliest nor the brightest folks. It may be worth a look. I wish I had room for it!     Jeff

Crazy Ray doesn't keep stuff long, they are &quot;Strange&quot; but the prices are
right
