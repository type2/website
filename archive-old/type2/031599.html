&gt; So, I hop in the '78 Riviera bus yesterday a.m. to go to the airport and she fires up, then promptly dies.  I tried a couple of more times, and it sounds like it is being choked out.  I look in back and all the hoses had become disconnected!  Wierd!  And I was just driving it the previous night, albeit fast (70mph).  I reconnected the hoses and all is well.

some kids were goofing around??
backfire??

&gt; So is this hose problem something to take note of?

if it happens again I would spend more time searching
