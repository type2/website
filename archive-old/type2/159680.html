Hmm... well, if that's true, which wouldn't be a huge deal, I guess it's 
down to WW or the OE Mexico seals - I'm ruling out WCM because I've 
heard too many issues w/ them already.

Jim,
How would you rank the quality of the seals that you have vs the WW 
seals?  I don't know if you're a vendor or an individual with an extra 
pair, but I figured you might be able to comment on the quality of the 
seals.  I don't mind spending more one way or another, I just don't want 
to do the job twice, ya know?

Thanks,
Mike
