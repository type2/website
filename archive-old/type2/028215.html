Hi Mike,

Although it sounds like a system that's been cobbled together from many 
different parts, it sounds like it has all of the required components.

The parts that the kits and the experts have are as follows: oil filter 
adapter (attaches to stock location and allows for aux. cooler), remote oil 
filter, thermostat, oil cooler.  The hoses sound like they'd be up to the 
task, and the fittings sound right as well.

I've been researching an aux. cooler for my '79, and yours sounds like a 
pretty complete kit.  I'd avoid putting the aux cooler in the engine 
compartment (excess heat), but someplace under the van is fine, as long as 
it doesn't interfere with ground clearance.  If it's in the air stream 
enough, you can probably get away without a fan, unless you're in a really 
hot climate.

Good luck!
