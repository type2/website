Subject: New Westy in the Family: AC for Sale

Hi Volks...I've been looking for a late bay Westy for a while and I've
recently purchased a very nice 79 (yes....I know.....one year only stuff
on it, but.....sheesh....it's only money).  One unfortunate aspect is
that it doesn't have the catalytic converter, crossover pipe, etc.  So
to pass N. VA emissions inspection I have to get that stuff.  Good news
is that Bus Depot can get it all for me; bad news is it'll cost (see
comment above) and it'll take a couple weeks to get here.

Anyways......this westy has the dealer installed air conditioning (also
have the operator's manual insert for it).  All components seem to be
present and it blows air but needs freon.  It's in the way (as far as
I'm concerned) so I'll make a good deal on it for someone who wants it. 

I hope to see a good many of you at Tom Forhan's Mid-Atlantic Holiday
Bus Fest.  It was a great time last year!

Bob
