Hello listees,

My Ignition switch seems to be giving me intermittent problems. 
Sometimes it works, other times....
I can always jump the solenoid directly to start the bus, so 
it's not the starter. The VOM tells me the battery has 12.25 volts, 
but the output from the ignition to the solenoid is 11.75 volts. 
Is this a normal drop to happen between the battery and the 
solenoid (15 feet of wire, through the Ignition switch)?
