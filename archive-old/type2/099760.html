Subject: Re: [T2] orbital sanders for nose work

I like DeVilbiss (sp?) air tools.  Available at Lowes.  Not much more expensive than Campbell Hausfeld and much better quality IMHO.  I bought their professional impact wrench and have only found one bolt that it wouldn't loosen, and after my friend's Ingersoll-Rand wrench wouldn't remove it either I felt pretty good.  Ended up needing a breaker bar and 4' cheater pipe for that one (91 Supra turbo crank pulley bolt).  Anyway, A D/A sander is not very expensive and they will take down paint and bondo VERY quickly compared to any electric sander (at least any one I have ever used).  I bet I could take the nose of my bus down to bare metal with it in 20 minutes.  Big time saver even at 50% duty (have to wait for my 20-gallon air tank to refill).  My DeVilbiss air chisel was also a bargain at $17 - I have chiseled up a LOT of ceramic tile and thinset with it with no problems whatsoever.
