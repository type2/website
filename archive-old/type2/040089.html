&gt; Anyone here ever buy a new 60's bus from the dealer, what were the selling

well I  bought a new 71 from one of the oldest VW dealers in the USA at
the time (Maryland VW) the one I bought had been used as the &quot;Shop
delivery van&quot; for about a year, I got a great deal on it because it had a
few minor dings in it, but had no major problems on it for over 100,000
miles that I owned it. 

&gt; Did the friendly VW salesman give it the old strength test a few hundred
&gt; times before selling it to the owner?

not really, he handed me the keys and said &quot;Take it out for a ride&quot; I
pretty much took it where I wanted and tested it the way I wanted, don't
remember him saying much.

&gt; P.S.S. fiance' forced me to buy a new VW. Wouldnt take &quot;restored bus?&quot; for
&gt; an answer. Im still workin on her.

shoulda bought a new Eurovan!  (assuming you are far richer than I, they
are outragious!)
