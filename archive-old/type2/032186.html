Subject: end play and bad things
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.3.96.990323162411.1333A-100000_at_ux7.cso.uiuc_dot_edu&gt;

exactly how much endplay is tolerable?  i learned the hard way that too
much endplay is really, really destructive.  the engine in my 69 westy got
a little to sloppy, and broke the crankshaft in half and also cracked the
case.  i wish i had pictures to post on the web to show this and scare
people.  so now i am an endplay junkie.  not hard to check or fix.
everybody should do it.  

to bill:   i would go with a beetlemex engine.  about 1000 bucks for a new
vw longblock delivered to your house.  cant beat that.  otherwise, do the
rebuild yourself.  its not that hard.

and has anyone tried bob hoovers method of mounting an oil temp sender?
the one where you put a plug in the relief valve on the rear of the engine
that is threaded to accept a sender?  thats most likely a project i will
do this summer, so i am curious to know if anyone has tried it.
