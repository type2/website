Subject: Alternator Squeeling like a Pig

My alternator started squealing bad. I thought it might be something worse
after my 1st engine pull this summer. I figured I did something stupid upon
install. But I disconnected the belt and squealing stopped. When I turn the
alternator by hand it has a tight squeaky spot. I really sprayed the engine
down w/ engine cleaner and water really saturated the alternator this
summer. Could this have caused the squeak? Could it be just lack of
lubricant on the bearings or is a squealing alternator a shot alternator?
Bentley suggest I can pull the alternator out without removing exhaust. Is
this a tough procedure? Because I want to get this fixed soon I'll probably
look for a rebuilt one in town. Any advice on purchasing one or the
installation snafu's I might run into?
Thanks,
