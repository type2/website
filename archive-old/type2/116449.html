You can talk to all the truckers &quot;good buddy&quot; and listen to them all cus you
out, &quot;that dam slow bus I almost hit going up that long grade&quot;. At least
you'll know when to get out of the way with a CB.

Subject: [VB] cell phones cross country


Currently I am in somewhat of a panic not really ready to leave Wednesday 
evening for eastern TN.
Someone suggested getting a CB
I have a cell phone with nationwide calling, does a CB offer anything much 
better?
