&gt;Hi Dok,

Hi, Mike,

It ain't so Tim.

&gt;And when I buy that long block 2.0L rebuilt, or used, engine do I have to
find
&gt;the specific fuel injection system for the CA manual trans, auto trans, 49
&gt;state manual trans, auto trans, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, GD or GD, hyd or
&gt;mech lifter engine?

Only if you want to be able to follow the Bentley with regard to settings.
If your vehicle is your hobby, and you don't have to rely on it as a daily
driver, do with it as you please. That's what hobbies are for. Experiment
all you want with your disposable income.

If you want to get in and have it start and idle and drive reliably every
day, stock works best. Every step away from stock is an experiment, and too
many times done by someone not qualified. Since these people rarely if ever
write down their data, all they have to offer is seat of the pants
testamonials and claims justifying their wizdom in parts mixing and
time/money spending. They rarely report when the motor goes clunk in half
or less the life of a stock setup.
