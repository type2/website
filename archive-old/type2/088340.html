Subject: RE: [T2] Thermal Electric Bus????

&gt; 
&gt; I asked a similar question and was told: they are energy hogs. They
cool
&gt; to
&gt; 40 degrees lower than the external temps - - that means if your
vehicle is
&gt; 95 degrees your drinks will only be 55 degrees. 120 degrees in the van
-
&gt; equals only 80 degrees inside the cooler.
&gt; 
&gt; Never heard of anyone trying to cool a space with one.
&gt; 

The efficiency is dependent the temperature differential. With a 40
degree temperature differential the efficiency is less than 25%. So to
move 1 watt of heat you have to supply 4 watts of electricity.

Not sure how much AC a bus requires but let's start with the size of a
single room home unit. They are about 5000 BTU/Hr, which is equal to
about 1500 watts of heat removal. So with the 25% efficiency the
thermoelectric module would require 6000 watts (12V at 500Amps) to cool
as much as a home unit using only using about 500 watts.

I would like to mount one of those small Honda generators (EU1000) in
the engine compartment with a custom add-on electric start and connected
to the buses fuel system to run a small RV roof mounted AC unit. AC
without loading or even running the engine, that would be the life.
Since I will be moving to AZ next year I might just have to make this
happen.
