Thanks to those who responded re the vw caps fitting the vanagon wheels. I
picked up a set for $20, buffed them up with steel wool and snapped them on.
Aside from not rattling down the street anymore, I think the plain look of
the vw caps suits the rather utilitarian nature of the air cooled vanagon.
