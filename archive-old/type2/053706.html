Subject: RE: Flywheel end play

&gt;From past experience I'd lug the motor to a reputable VW mech and have them
check it. Cost me all of $12 bucks at Autovise in Lynnwood, WA. Good value
since I didn't have the gauge. I too couldn't see any disernable movement in
the endplay... but the gauge DID.  (C8

&gt;
&gt;The new block has the shims in place but I don't have a gauge to
&gt; check it. It doesn't seem to have any movement at all. Is it possible to
&gt; not have enough play with the shims in place? Seems that with shims in
&gt; place and old drive plate that it would be to much play instead not
&gt; enough.
