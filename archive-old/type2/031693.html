&gt; The Bus Depot lists an 050 mech adv dist for 72-79

&gt; any advice/comments will be greatly appreciated

on the threat of excomunication I will toss caution to the wind and wade
into this quagmire

VW saw fit to put a number of different dist's on the type 2, most ran
reasonably well. but they all wear out.

rather than maintaining a stock of all these different dizzys the folks at
Bosch and VW started marketing the 009 and  the 050 mech adv dist. as a
universal replacement.

the 009 and less common 050 do indeed work. sort of.
most buses will run with em. but again the advance curve is not right on
and there is a lag or delay in advancing.   

the amount of destruction this will do is highly debated and I will not
touch that.  BUT suffice it to say that in almost all circumstances the
stock dist. will run a stock engine better and more efficiently than the
aftermarket generic dist's

IN my case finding the correct Dist and replacing a 009 that the PO had
installed caused a noticable improvement in acceleration and
performance..not sure about the gas mileage though.

so IMNSHO  I say that if at all possible run the stock dist, but a 009
will work if neccesary.  in other words don't stop driving your bus
because you can't find the stock dist.
