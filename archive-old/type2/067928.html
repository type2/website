Subject: Weatherstripping for '66

I was wondering if anyone had some alternatives to the repro
cargo door seals on a '66.  The repro stuff may be nice, but
its really ni$$$$$$$$e.

Now that I've got my funky cardboard&amp;duct tape (tm) partition,
its not as big a deal, but it might keep out some noise as
well.

Thanks,
...Markus
