If you check out REI online (and I have no affiliation w/REI and rarely shop
there), they have some folding chairs/camp chairs that are pretty cheap.
We've got something similar and 3-4 of these will tuck underneath the rear
luggage portion of the fiberglass top (71 westy).  I think they're less than
$15 each, but maybe even less now.

Cheers,

At a ham radio get together in Dayton last weekend, I saw some really cool
camp chairs.
I liked the recliner especially well, and thought other might like to take
a look.

Looked nice for sitting around the old burning logs at night.
