Subject: Re: [T2] shifter

Just finished this yesterday (rebuilding the shifter that is).  I suppose it
depends on far you plan on going in response to how easy is it.  I pulled
the motor/transaxle/tranny to get the rear rod out and replace all the
bushings, install new boots and clean out/regrease the carrier tube.  Only
took about half a day for the whole job.  You can do plenty to help things
without taking the rear rod all the way out.  It was convenient for me since
I cut out the rear torsion tube and rewelded it to get about 5 inches of
lift!

Good luck,
Bill

Subject: [T2] shifter


&gt; being new to the bus scene i have a question about my
&gt; shifter.  i took it out when i was por-15ing the floor
&gt; and when putting it back in it seem to pop out and get
&gt; all loose when i go to shift into 4th like it is
&gt; missing the little pin on the end of the shifter which
&gt; it is not, i think it is just comming out of the hole.
&gt;  any ideas?  i think it needs a new shifter bushing,
&gt; is this an easy fix in a bus.  i have done it several
&gt; times in bugs and things but never a bus.  thanks in
&gt; advance.  o' btw, it is a 72 westy.
