Subject: Funtime.  And Cable Q.

Hi folks. 
    Got to participate in our first VW cruise.  What an awesome thing. On 
June 22nd, after we all drove our VWs to work, we held an after work meeting, 
and a cruise afterwards. I live in a medium sized town, but up north here 
there are relatively few Vdubs. What great fun to be cruising our local strip 
with about 20 VWs or so!! 

    Unfortunately, the next day, while cruising in da bus, I suddenly started 
losing clutch. It was grabbing closer and closer to the floor in a hurry. To 
make a long story short, the clutch cable was literally falling apart in the 
rear. I made it home with about  3 strands of wire left, I think. 
    Thanks to the helpful guy at Bus Depot, a new one is en route. It looks 
like a straightforward install, even for a novice like me. But the question 
is,  what type of grease should I lube up the cable with when I install it?  
A white lithium grease? Or is there a better solution?  Thanks in advance.
