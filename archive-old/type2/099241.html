Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder rebuild questions (long)

Hi Jeff, my time to help! I done so many heads and cylinders rebuilt on
motorcycle engine that I can give you a few hints. (Answers below you
questions)

&gt;&gt;1. Is it common for the VW heads to drop seats this easily? I was
hoping
to just replace the one head as the compression is fine on the other.&lt;&lt;

- Well, I don't have enough experience with air-cooled VW engine to tell
you yes but it look like VW engineer were drunk for 20 years (separate
valve seat!!!) By looking at your picture I would assume that this
engine is at the end of is first life (top end at least)! The carbon
accumulation on 1 of the cylinder in particular shows heavy oil
consumption/carbonization.

&gt;&gt;2. Is it OK just to replace the one head?&lt;&lt;

NO, never. (Unequal compression = vibration = unbalance = oscillation) I
could do a full-page post on this subject, and I will one day.
Especially on opposed cylinder configuration (BMW and Honda motorcycle
experience)

&gt;&gt;3. Any suggestions (sources) for a good cheap pair of ring clamps for
VW's?&lt;&lt;

I can easily put a 4-cylinder section on 4 pistons (2 at the same time)
without any tools or clamp. This is a lot easier on a single cylinder
(VW as 4 separate one). Use your finger and a friend! If you really want
to use a clamp, you can use an oil filter tool/clamp with a strip of
slim rubber to protect the ring. Putting back one cylinder at a time can
easily be done by hand and without any tool, one ring at a time.
Remember the 1/3 or 1/2 turn rule when putting the cylinder back on the
rings. I just did so on my spare 1700cc.

&gt;&gt;I have never honed a cylinder. Is this necessary if I keep the
existing rings? Or should I just replace the rings.&lt;&lt;

If the picture you showed us are your heads and cylinder, Replace the
rings for sure, period. (I would personally replace cylinders and
pistons also if money is not a problem) It is not necessary and you
shouldn't hone the cylinders if you don't change rings = change at least
the rings!!!!!! Wile your there! And honed the cylinders if you do so.

&gt;&gt;Will a shop hone thecylinders?&lt;&lt;
Any shop can do that

&gt;&gt;Where is a good source for VW cylinderhone tool?&lt;&lt;
Don't do that yourself the first time, look at the mechanic and learn!

&gt;&gt;If I replace the rings, what happens if I do this on only one side?
Will this unbalance the engine?&lt;&lt;

Same answer as above, DON'T.

&gt;&gt;In the process of dropping the seat, the valve put a small ding in
the piston. Should I worry about this?&lt;&lt;

Sorry to say, but yes.

&gt;&gt;I notice a lot of carbon deposits under the valve cover and past the
cylinder head seal. In addition the seal on # 1 cylinder was warped.
This indicates that the valves and cylinder were leaking. The worst
carbon deposits are on #2 cylinder. It's seal looked fine. What causes
this and how do I avoid the problem when I rebuild the engine?&lt;&lt;

What you got in the combustion chamber area (right cylinder on the
picture = #2 Cylinder Blowby) is the result of a bad / worn rings, you
got burned oil deposit (very advance oil consumption). On the left side,
it's an uneven head seal caused by an uneven/broken head gasket and/or
uneven head mating surface or/and by uneven head bolt torque. You also
have worn rings on this side also. This engine was very badly maintained
with rare oil change, the valve cover picture shows clearly that. This
picture (Valve Cover Combustion Residue) also shows that oil residue (=
old oil!!!) cooked on the head, this is caused by overheating or poor
maintenance (rare oil change).

&gt;&gt;When I had adjusted the valves (about 300 miles before problem) the
lifters appeared soft. Looking at the lifters they look almost
brand-new? They have been in the car for 20 years. Should I 1) bother
trying to rebuild the lifters (clean them) and then purge the air, 2)
just purge the air, or 3) buy new ones?&lt;&lt;

I guess you have hydraulic lifter!!! they pissed me off. I spent 2 full
days trying to bleed those on my Vanagon. Look at Boston Bob web site,
he as a good article on those suckers:
http://www.bostonengine_dot_com/articles/hydraulicll.htm

&gt;&gt;The neighborhood we live in gives us problems if they see a car
disabled. They threatened to have the van towed when I was replacing the

gas tank. A tight budget means that I must do the work myself here. Thus

I have stripped the tin, exhaust, etc. with the engine in the car to
remove the problem cylinder. Other than making this task slightly more
difficult, is there any other reason why I can't complete the repair
with the engine in the car?&lt;&lt;&lt;

NO, but for sure it's always easier to work on an engine when it's on a
stand.
I found that if you got that far with the engine in the car you can
rebuilt the top-end without removing the engine, you just need a little
more dexterity!

&gt;&gt;The cylinder head studs and heads were rusty. Should these or all
the studs be replaced?&gt;&gt;

Soak them in fuel or any other strong solvent for a day or 2.

&gt;&gt;In the future what is the best way to lock the studs into the case so
that they do nott come out when I am trying to just take of the head?&lt;&lt;

Locktite my friend, the red one.


I am sorry that my English suck that much, I would have some more
technical stuff to tell you but &quot;words&quot; in the Shakespeare language are
missing from my poor English vocabulary.

I also feels that you are on a tight budget and I fully understand,
change the rings and have the cylinder honed by a pro. Please do that
for both heads. Have the head rebuilt by a pro also. This implies the
new seats (be carefull about that!!! Not all machine shop knows about
the VW valve seat system), new valve guide, head mating surface
machined. I guess that new exhaust valve will be needed too.

I sincerely wish you good luck.
Cheers, Ben
