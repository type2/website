&gt;Correct, as stated in my original post. What I'm trying to determine is
&gt;whether or not this will have a detrimental effect when running with carbs.

I think big valves are overrated, and therefore I think that the smaller 
valves of the 2.0 heads will not cost you much hp, and may possibly improve 
low end torque due to greater velocity.

&gt;No. The cans are the same diameter. The stroke is longer on a 2l. I confirmed
&gt;this yesterday at the local VW FLAPS by comparing head gaskets for 2l and
&gt;1.8l heads. They are identical. (Different part numbers, but identical.)

The bore is larger on a 2 liter - 94mm vs. 93mm on the 1800.  I'm not sure 
if the outside diameter is exactly the same or not, but it is close enough 
that you can use the same gasket for either one.
