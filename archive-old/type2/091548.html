&gt; &gt; The problem isn't the shroud, it's the finning on the heads and barrels.
&gt; &gt; The doghouse fan already moves lots of air past the cylinders, but the
&gt; &gt; fins can only transfer so much heat to the air.  I doubt that the 911
&gt; &gt; shroud will move that much more air past the cylinders, and the air isn't
&gt; &gt; as well directed inside the open plenum.
&gt;
&gt; I think on Jake Ray's site he says the 911 fan can move air at
&gt; 3000 cu.ft./min. In other words it can move enough air to cool a 400HP 3.6L
&gt; Turbo 911.

This is with the fins on the 6-cylinder Porsche engine.  I would also like
to see that Porsche engine pull 400HP for a half-hour straight without
melting.

The fan may well move 3000CFM in free-air conditions, but I doubt that it
can force that kind of flow through the fins on the VW cylinders.  If the
air doesn't go through the fins, it doesn't do any good!

&gt; He states that the real trick is to match all the parts to your
&gt; engine so you aren't over or under-cooling the engine.

Absolutely true, and very difficult to do without some major investments
in time and expense.

&gt; One of the possibilities he mentions is using Aluminum finned cylinders to
&gt; make real use of the 911 fan and radiate the heat better.

Of course, we could change the cylinder spacing to allow bigger finning,
and while we are at it we could increase the number of cylinders to
increase fin area.

Oh, dear!  I've just invented a Porsche engine!

It would be a lot easier to just swap in a stock engine of the desired
power.  Making big power out of little parts is a racer's game, not one
for a daily driver.
