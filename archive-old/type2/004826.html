Hi everybody!

If you missed EveryBus and/or Merlefest here is another chance to do some
camping and listen to some Bluegrass Music.

May 15th and 16th at Hagan-Stone Park in Pleasant Garden, NC will be the
host of the 2nd annual Pickin' in the Park. This is a free event that offers
workshops and performances put on by members of the local Bluegrass
community. Campsites are available with hooks-ups and hot showers for $12.00
per site(one vehicle and 4 adults.) You can call ahead and reserve a site by
calling the park office at 336-674-0472. Ignore the message about having to
reserve 6 or more sites.

Even if you are not a big bluegrass fan load up the bus and come on out. HSP
is a beautiful 425 acre wildlife refuge with hiking and walking trails,
playgrounds for the kids and even a few small lakes for fishing( no license
required if you use live or recently deceased bait.)

If you need more info call the park on send me a p-mail to
