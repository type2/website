Subject: what the kids are doing these days

a few months ago i heard about a young boy who had come through the
neighborhood. one day he had stopped around the corner to check out george
with the 59 beetle project. george's wife told him no and she told my wife
what had happened. later in the day the boy had come to my house to see if
one of my buses was for sale, so my wife said. hmm, remarkable, i just heard
about him.  two weeks ago the boy makes his way to my wife's garage sale. my
wife points him out to me as the kid without a vw. he introduced himself to
me then scanned the buses inside-out, of course asking if either was for
sale.

he was all about air-coolds. during a brief chat he asked if i heard of the
idiot guide; that he was going to buy one. i told him i always find them in
junkyards, and i could nab one for him. so, off he went with muir up to
2.0L, psyched.

couple days ago he came into my studio while i was glazing pots. he came to
thank me because the book had made a huge impact. turned out he was on a
highway with his family in their vanagon. his story goes - the vanagon was
choking on itself and conked out. fantastically, he was reading his idiot
guide at the time. he did some quick reading on the subject and realized he
had to hit the cylinder head with a hammer. sure enough he unstuck an exhast
valve. he went on to explain that the catalytic converter was getting fouled
and was running rough due to this stuck valve. a mechanic had since looked
at it and properly tri-cut the heads, etc, etc..  eleven years old.

i have a mint 75 nose in my backyard and wants to buy it. i told him he'd
better ask his parents...it's not exactly a project.  steve
