Subject: Re: shipping costs

 I ship bus parts everyday!  A little red, white, and blue truck picks them
 up at my front door. *who goes to the post office ?*
 try click and ship on-line.

 Priority flat rate boxes are for up to 50 lbs. max. but according to my
 post-master they will ship any thing in that box if you can get it in
there,
 regardless of the weight, and if it will fit into their machine.

 First class is usually more than priority for any thing near 1 lb.
