&gt;Seems like I read somewhere on the list that the timing for #3 cylinder is
&gt;detuned (redarded) by design relative to the other cylinders.  If I rotate
&gt;wires 90 degrees, wouldnt this detune #4 instead of #3?

I heard about something like that on type I engines, but I have never seen
reference to it on a type IV.  This includes ALL of the manuals and written
documentation I have ever come across, and my own experience with the type
IV.  Therefore I am reasonably confident that there is no retard built into
any cylinder on the type IV.  I can hardly believe that VW would even do
such a thing - it is a ridiculous way to &quot;solve&quot; an overheating problem.

&gt;This weekend I advanced the drive shaft one tooth in an effort to get the
&gt;advance I need.  

How did you end up doing that without risking the washers falling out?

&gt;With the engine at idle, I get no reduction in idle speed or timing retard
&gt;when I remove the vacuum advance hose from the distributor.  Is this
&gt;normal?  

Yes.  The advance hose will have no effect at idle.  My distributor is a
dual vacuum unit that retards the timing at idle but I don't know if the
'79 has that.  Maybe it's done by the computer?
