&gt;     If I wanted to buy a &quot;crate&quot; longblock, preferably an 1800 or larger

Given the large amount of information out there regarding GEX and their 
inability to produce a quality product it's very easy to just assume you 
got a lemon. However, since a longblock is a major investment are you 
sure this is the problem. All that aside I have heard good things about 
Boston Bob should you require a new engine.
