&gt; Are you in a cold climate? I once had a 76 with a
&gt; Weber carb on it and it ran like a scalded dog when
&gt; the weather was warm, but as soon as the temp fell to
&gt; below 35 degrees, it would not idle.  At the time
&gt; other listmembers told me it was caused by &quot;icing&quot; in
&gt; the intake manifold.

Allow me to agree and expand.  You will experience carburetor icing
anywhere between 32 and 60 degrees fahrenheit if the relative humidity is
high enough.  Where and when you experience this will depend on local
conditions.  In dry climates this will not be a problem and in very cold
or hot climates this will not be a problem but at cool to moderate
temperatures with moderate to high humidities it will very definitely be a
problem.  The cures on a type4 engine are either dual carburetors or move
to a desert.

                             OOK!
