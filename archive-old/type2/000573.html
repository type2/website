+AD4-Typical of a bad sender in the tank. The facts are either good, bad or
+AD4-ugly. But they are still the facts and the panel to the tank will have to
+AD4-come out after removal of the motor, or after you pretend you can get it
+AD4-out and back in with access to the sender with the motor still in for 2
+AD4-hours before you admit the need to remove the motor.

Seriously, you don't need to get the motor out, well not the type 4 with
carbs, though I'm pretty sure you would have to on the upright engine.

I don't know about the FI, but if you take the carbs off and the electric
fan, you can be in there in 20 minutes. Getting the tank cover panel on can
be a struggle though, but I did the whole job in 2 hours.
