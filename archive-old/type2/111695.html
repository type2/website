Subject: Re: [T2] Custom Wheels

lets see...first of all...the audi 5000/ 100/200 are teh
5-112 pattern...just the 4000 and the 80(lesser models) are
4-lug
read on..
&gt; &lt;&lt;  regarding hogging out the holes for teh acorn nuts? 
&gt; I
&gt; say stay away from that, get the nuts/studs that are
&gt; designed for the wheels(mercedes/audi and life will be
&gt; easier(AND SAFER!!!) &gt;&gt;
 
&gt; Perhaps I should have said dished...The Mercedes uses 
&gt; lug bolts that sit flat against the wheel's steel insert.
&gt; The Bus uses lug nuts with a convex face. A ball grinder
&gt; bit used on the Mercedes wheel insert gives a concave
&gt; face to it. 
how about using flat-faced lug nuts! DUH?  ;-)
We've been going over this all(in theory, and buying
lugs/studs etc...) for the vanagons for a while...not
hooked up any of the wheels as the centers on most need to
be enlarged for the sychro hub to fit...but soon. the
mercedes fit right away if I recall...not remember ing the
offset info right now....some of teh aftermarket bbs style
ones we have have large centers..there's lots of stuff out
there on mercedes and audis to look at..go to pick-n-pull
or similar and have a loook-see

&gt;Using the stock Mercedes lug bolts would
&gt; require
&gt; pressing the VW lug bolts out of the drums and calipers.
&gt; I've no idea if the holes would/could be tapped to accept
&gt; the Mercedes bolts...
not sure of this...on vanagons tehy are threaded in...are
they presse infrom teh back on the loaf?
