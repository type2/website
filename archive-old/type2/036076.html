Subject: Dormobile top window seal

Salut tout le monde, (hi everybody)

My good friend Marie-Louise the Dormobile needs new window seals for her 
poptop windows.  Dormobile people know what I'm talking about but for the 
rest of you, there is 2 large fized windows and 2 sunroof windows on a 
Dormobile top.  These 4 window are in a flot horizontal spot and are realy 
sensitive to water.  Also, they never get in the shade and UV slowly 
destroy them.  As a result, water in comming in by this way.  My sunroofs 
has been changed once for american standard car sunroofs, so I easisly get 
replacement seals in a window shop I guess.  But for the fixed window all I 
know is that Just Kampers have the seals for 17.25 Pounds and shipping and 
custom and canadian taxes.... this will rise to 100 $can each. &quot;Non, non, 
non, non, non, pas question!&quot;

Who did ever change these seals, and where can I get them.  Do you have a 
american size reference, a DURO number.  My concern is that I dont want to 
remove a window to get the seal and then be unable to find a replacement 
one....more rain in, you know...
