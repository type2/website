&gt; Anyone see the three part series on adding AC in VW

&gt; think the Sanden 508 was supposed to be a good unit,
&gt; anyone know if they are used as oe on any vehicles?

The Sanden 508 is a very widely used compressor.
you can find it almost everywhere and in many different
frame configurations.  Used in VW Rabbit
I have Two of them of slightly different mounting brackets
that I'll use one of, to put AC into my '60 Double Cab.
