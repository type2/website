What year is your bus?  In 73-74 at least, there is a valve that allows air 
to be either drawn in from the front of the engine, as you state, when it 
is cold or from the side vent when it is warm.  The valve is controlled by 
a vacuum switch in the air filter housing.  I don't know what the cutoff 
temperature is.  I don't know for sure about other years but I expect that 
they also draw air in from the vents when it is warm (likely most of the time).
