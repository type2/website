Gary: 

That's good news.  I try to avoid going thru the dealers whenever I can because 
they tend to be so pricey on a lot of items. I'm surprised they're so reasonable through VW.

 Thanks for the info.

Vanagon stabilizer bushings (presumably all the same for at least
'80-'84) are readily available from the dealer.  $14 or so for
all four.  Also buy the all 4 washer-like objects and the 2 spacers
the bar goes through.  Maybe $40 for the whole thing (I've been
trying to salvage the non-rubber parts, but on  my van they were
all beyond hope -- rust rust rust).

My stabilizer bar was hanging free, completely rusted through
at both ends!!!!
