Subject: 78 Westfalia interior for sale

I have the old interior out of my 78 Westy for sale. This is the 
interior that has a ice box and sink. I switched it out for one that has 
a stove and fridge. It's in fairly decent shape. It's basically 
everything but the front seats. It is missing a handle hear and there. 
Does have a few chips and stuff in the laminate. Would make a great 
start to a &quot;Westfakia&quot;. I really need to get this out of my way in the 
garage. The rear seat is covered in green/yellow plaid. I would like 
$100.00/best offer/trade something?? LOCATED IN MYSTIC,CT.
