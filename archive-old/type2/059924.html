What is a $$ estimate for such a conversion?  Is a 2 litre Bus tranny a
good way to go?  Would it be cheaper/better to have the reduction gearbox
trans re-built and the use of a different ring and pinion (for hiway use)
installed?
Anyone having done this, could send me private E-mail with pros and cons,
and any little secrets of the swap they have learned from a hands on
experience, would be appreciated.
Thanks
