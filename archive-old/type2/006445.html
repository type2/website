&gt; which promptly stripped a friend of mines plug hole on a brand new
&gt; &gt;$1200 racing HEAD (not plural).
&gt;
&gt; Did he not know that plugs that can't be turned to the seat with finger
&gt; strength shouldn't be forced in with a wrench?????????????

doesn't matter if there are burrs on the threads. He didn't check it, and it
bit him.

I have seen this on several occasions, and this is what made me drop them
(selling them)


&gt; The only prob I have ever seen with a Bosch plug was a batch of platinums
&gt; that had electrodes with a tendency to creap. It was an anomaly. Must
agree
&gt; that half a buck is chump change. At $2.00 a pop, Bosch is still the right
&gt; plug for the great majority of the European engines, more especially air
&gt; cooled German motors.

NGKs are $2.25ea or so.

And, last time I checked, the NEW longblocks from VW had NGKs in em'.
