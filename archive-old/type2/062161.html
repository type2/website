Headline: Virtually anyone can travel north with these real Volkswagen
          vans

By Peter Wilson &lt;pmwilson_at_wimsey_dot_com&gt;

If a month on the road from Vancouver to Inuvik in a caravan of
Volkswagen buses sounds like heaven, then do we have the virtual
vacation for you.
        Okay, it's not the real thing.  You're a tad late for that.  The
caravan left on Monday for points north.
        But if you want to ride along in a virtual way while some 20
vehicles--from a 1966 microbus to a 1996 Eurovan Camper--make the 4,200
kilometre trek north this summer just point your browser towards the
Inuvik website at
http://www.chaco_dot_com/inuvik/
        There you'll discover that not all internet users sit through the
best weather of the summer staring enviously at the surfing avocado on
the California Avocado Board home page.  No, they're out there on the
road fending for themselves and having a great time of it.
        Or so the trek organizers--Tobin Copley of Vancouver and Ron Lussier
of Cupertino, Calif.--hope.
        The trip, says Lussier on the web page, will take the buses and the
27 people signed up for it not only along highways but also along &quot;dirt,
gravel, and shale roads.&quot;  Eleven vehicles headed out from Vancouver and
will be joined by others, coming from such places as Oshawa, Ont., and
Anchorage, Alaska, on the way.
        Adds Lussier: &quot;The folks making the trip will all share a love of
Volkswagen buses and not much else.  One driver is a flautist who was
the voice of Woodstock from the old Charlie Brown specials and another
is a conservative from Orange County, Calif.&quot;  [TTC: Neither Martha
Rubin nor Steve Maher were able to make the trip.]
        The group got together for the trip through the Internet's Vanagon
mailing list, which is a virtual club for the drivers of Volkswagen
buses.  Anyone can join the list by sending an e-mail message to
listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu and include the message subscribe vanagon
your_email_address.  For those not familiar with the terminology, this
simply means that the words &quot;subscribe vanagon&quot; are followed by your e-
mail address.
        Details now on the website include a news release on the trip, a map
of the journey, and a complete itinerary so that even if you're not on
the road with the caravan you can be there in your imagination.  There
are plans for those on the trip to file details as they travel to
Inuvik.
        As well, those who have only e-mail access can follow the trip by
joining the Inuvik mailing list by sending a message to inuvik-
request_at_chaco_dot_com.
        The body of the letter should include just the word &quot;subscribe,&quot; but
without the quotes around it, of course.
        If all has gone according to plan the group should be camping
tonight at the Liard River Hotsprings provincial park after having left
the Husky RV Park at Fort Nelson this morning.
