&gt; yes, i think i was stuck in the exact portion you are stuck in.
&gt; 
&gt; i think i found the answer about the spot welds in the archives, but it took HOURS of searching.
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW...the person who did the welding for me used a wire-feed type of welder, if that makes any difference??? (i'm not a welder &amp; i dont play one on tv). from what i remember the actual welding took less than 10 seconds for each side.

Bingo,  I have a MIG welder so a went out there and cleaned the ends up,
grabbed the welder and put a line down the center, when I was sure they
were straight.

zap.

much banging and &quot;encouraging&quot; language.  also found it makes it easier to
get em started if you take off the upper rubber stop. (of course then you
have to get the bugger back on)

in any case, fought with it for 6-7 hours before posting, after finding
the &quot;Trick&quot; took about an hour after welding.

only have one spindle back on but it is moving along

THANKS big time

Bob


&gt; 
&gt; when the arms are removed it breaks the old weld. mine just crumbled &amp; left hardly any evidence that they were there originally.  once i knew they were supposed to be there i could see where it had crumbled.
&gt; 
&gt; good luck,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; BTDT &amp; yes, you are right. the manuals are really no help on this one.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; we used a small section of 4x4 wood along with a hammer.  work one side on
&gt; &gt; (which you have already done) &amp; then try to get the other side on. you might
&gt; &gt; have to go back &amp; forth from side to side &amp; keep working them on little by
&gt; &gt; little until they are both secure.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; also, did you replace the spot welds on the ends of the torsion leaves? until
&gt; 
&gt; SPOT WELDS???? they have spot welds!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; we realized we needed to re-do that weld, we had no luck whatsoever in
&gt; &gt; getting the new arms installed. the leaves wouldnt line up with the notches in
&gt; &gt; the arms until they were welded together.
&gt; 
&gt; time to dig out the welder,!  Thanks!
