&lt;&lt; I usually drive about 62mph on the highway but occasionally go a few mph 
faster if the road is clear and I have a tailwind or slight downgrade.  I 
don't generally slow down for 55mph zones in the hope that one day I will get 
a speeding ticket in my bus.  Sometimes I even speed up when I see a cop.  
When that day comes, I am going to frame that puppy and hang it on the wall.  
It will be worth going to traffic school for the lifetime of laughs it will 
bring.  I don't speed in town nor do I want to receive a citation for doing 
so, but I think it would be amusing to get a speeding ticket on the highway 
in an old VW bus.  Anyone ever gotten one?  Mike &quot;Porsche-boy&quot; Gensler need 
not reply.  :)  Let the flames commence!

Try movin' that fast in Joisey...Not only do we pay the highest initial 
insurance
rates in the country, but the &quot;surcharge&quot; for moving violations tacked on your
insurance bill is fast approaching mortgage proportions. And will probably get
lots worse as the state and municipalities scramble for &quot;new&quot; sources of
revenue to replace the lost revenue from investments...Unlike a marked 
state trooper or local cop car cruising the road to keep everybody &quot;honest&quot;
and safe (the reason for the laws in the first place),an unmarked car or 
radar-
trap is an invisible tax...;-(

Tony in NJ (NYC at least makes no bones about it and includes parking 
violations
                 in its general revenues and budgets accordingly...But no
