&gt; you can't really thoroughly clean/rebuild injectors because of some of
&gt; the internal parts.

I had all 4 of my injectors cleaned two years ago by Cruzin  
Performance for about that price:

These were my test results:

Immediately after running the engine again, I found I was able to rev  
much higher in each gear. The cleaning process was inexpensive, turn  
around was fast and the results impressive. Spray pattern matters.

I recommend cleaning to anyone especially those undertaking an engine  
rebuild. Just pay for the cleaning and put on the hose yourself to  
save money.
