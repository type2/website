you would think.  you might try skimming your idle down to 800 or 850
with the idle adjust screw and then playing with the mixture screw, but,
given that it won't hold a steady idle...

&gt; Also,  the carb won't hold a steady idle, it lopes from about 850 
&gt; to 1000 rpm's and occasionally saunters  up to 1400, 1500 rpm's. 
&gt; What's up with that??  Vacumme leak? 

sounds like a vacuum leak to me.  I had similar problems with my
34pict3 and it was a vacuum leak in the throttle arm of the carb. 

I would sort out your vacuum leak before you worry about adjusting
the carb.  I say this from experience, as last month I thought, despite
a *slight* bounce in the idle that i had everything else adjusted, carb
included.  Needless to say, the test drive went poorly and I'm
still sorting out some of the issues as we speak.

ugh.  I'm actually seriously considering moving to the 30pict because
it's apparently a lot more stable.

good luck!
