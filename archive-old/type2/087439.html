Subject: Re: RE: [T2] Main Harness - how difficult to replace

Hiya Robert,

I'd agree with Theodore concerning the taking of &quot;before&quot; pictures and 
cozying up with a COLOR Bentley (the newer editions are all in B&amp;W) wiring 
diagram (or hit vintagebus_dot_com).  But I'd also suggest that you find a a 
pretty much stocked-out 71 in your area.  Then take pictures of that set-up.  
Having a &quot;model&quot; to go by is simply invaluable when you are contemplating a 
job this intricate and you are, basically, starting from scratch.
