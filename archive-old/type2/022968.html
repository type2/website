&gt;90 MPH in a bus, without pushing it hard???  Are you SURE you want an 
&gt;air-cooled VW????

Sounds to me like he wants his drivers license revoked.  :-)  Anyway 90 in 
a bus isn't very safe, even if you could do it continuously.  The brakes 
and suspension aren't designed for that kind of speed.  Mike G's 914/901 
powered bus can do it, but by his own admission it was a whole lot of work 
and has some drawbacks.

IMO, get a car designed to handle those sorts of speeds, like an '87 
Mustang, and put a stock-ish aircooled engine in your bus.  Then go to Skip 
Barber, Bondurant, or other driving school and learn how to drive safely at 
those kinds of speeds!  And be prepared to be thrown in jail and/or pay big 
fines, depending on when and where you get caught.
