Subject: Re: [T2] what would grove the push rod

Hmmm, that's a new one on me. Is the pushrod tube dented in there, that 
might cause the soft aluminum to wear on it? Perhaps a piece of metal jammed 
down inside the pushrod tube?

Subject: [T2] what would grove the push rod


&gt;I just took the #1 exhaust push rod from an engine, I was told was recently
&gt; rebuilt and found it has a grove about 10 mm wide and 2 mm deep about 2.5 
&gt; cm
&gt; from the lifter end.
