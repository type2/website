&gt; A couple hours to pull the motor and slap it back? I would love to see
that

&gt; longer. A beginner needs to set aside a whole day and a helping hand for
&gt; each of the tasks. Aside from problems that is.

For me, remove takes an hour.  Reinstall also takes an hour.  Fixing all
the &quot;little things that need to get done while the engine is out&quot; can take
days!

&gt;  &quot;Hang in there. You can do it. We're here for you.&quot;............. Do you
&gt; work for Checker?

Is that Checker's slogan?  With perseverance, just about any problem with
a VW will yield, even to a novice.  All it takes is time and
communication.
