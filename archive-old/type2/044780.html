Subject: [T2] Ack!  Valve Adj. Screw

I finally started tuning up my bus and got as far as adjusting the
intake valve on the 4th cylinder and had the adjustment screw and 
lock bolt strip on me!  Ack!  And I'm supposed to head up north
sometime tomorrow!

Does anyone know of a pick-n-pull, junkyard, specialty parts store or
other method by which I could get a valve adjuster screw anywhere in 
southern california
on a Sunday (or Saturday late night for that matter?)  Am I out of luck
until Monday?

thanks,
	t

ps thanks for the 'fo on the distributor earlier in the week.  turns out i 
have a 009... :)
