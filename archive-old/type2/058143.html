Subject: discrepency in deck height measurements

Afternoon all -I'm doing a bit of engine repair on my
'71 bus with a type 1 engine, including figuring out
what my compression ration is. While measuring my
deck height, cylinders 1 and 2 measure out at.053 and
.055 respectively, while 3 and 4 measure out at .075
each.  Questions:  What can cause such big
differences?  Should I worry about it?  Shave the
pistons on 1 and 2 to balance the numbers?  Add the 4
readings together divide by 4, therefore using the
average, which is about .064?  A bit of background. 
The engine is a 1776 with a stroke of 69.  I'd rather
not split the case, as the engine only has about
15,000 miles on it.  Thanks in advance
Brian Armstrong
