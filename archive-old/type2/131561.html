Subject: AVP or AMC Heads for 2.0 FI?

Hi Folks,

I'm still trying to source good inexpensive heads for my 2.0 FI.  So far, I 
have found that both AVP and AMC offer heads that work on the 2.0 FI 
engines.  I checked the archives, and AMC appears to have a less-than-ideal 
reputation -- almost as bad as GEX engines.

So given the choice between &quot;new&quot; AMC heads for $335 each or &quot;rebuilt&quot; AVP 
heads for $189 each, what is the opinion of The List?  I like the idea of 
new parts, unless they are junk from the start (i.e. Brazilian VW vs German 
VW).  I like the idea of low prices, unless you get what you pay for (i.e. 
$1200 for GEX vs $4000 for Raby's).  Given that this is a fairly significant 
cash outlay for a very significant part, any constructive opinions are 
helpful.

However, I'm geting annoyed enough with being car-less that I might 
entertain offers for purchase....

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.
