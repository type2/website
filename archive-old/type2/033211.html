Just to beat this horse completely to death;&gt;)

The late Gene Berg wrote a great tech. article on CRs and
fuel octane requirements.

We all know who Mr. Burg was don't we?

Per tech. article GB801CR, a VW at 7.1 CR requires 91
(RON+MON)/2 fuel to avoid damage running todays fuels.

To my knowledge, Berg never sold gasoline. He has no stake
in the market except to sell engines. With the chance to
sell more parts when engines fail, why would he publish such
a comment? Because he loved the car and tried to pass on his
knowledge to others.

I would post the article, but it is copyrighted material.
Its still for sale, pick up a copy.
