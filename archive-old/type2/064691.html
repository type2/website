Subject: Cooling tin question

Hi 

I have been redoing the cooling tin on my 78 2.0 FI engine, and I had a
couple of questions.

1. When I removed the tin, it seemed that there was some sort or sealer or
double sided tape between some of the pieces.  Is this normal, and if it is,
where can I get the tape or can i just use any double-sided foam tape.

2.  How does the airflow system work with regards to the thermostat on these?
 When it's cold, the right side port is open, and when the thermostat
contracts, that closes and the left side over the oil cooler, opens.  Is this
correct?

3. What are the openings on the upper part of the heat exchanger at the front
supposed to do?(The ones aiming back at the rear of the bus) a po covered
them with soda cans.  do I need to be concerned with this?

Thanks for any help.
