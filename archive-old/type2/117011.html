Subject: Re: [T2] anyone ever fix a hole in heat exchanger??

i haven't personally used it but por15 has a new hi temp cloth and hi temp
paint that seems as though it would be perfect for fixing a heat exchanger.
i've thought about doing it just to bolster mine to make it last longer.

i have yet to pull it out but im almost definite that
i have leaks/holes in my heat exchangers..

has anyone any luck patching/welding them shut..

I know its hard to get a weld to stick to something
with carbon buildup, has anyone any
suggestions/materials such as epoxy or jb weld that
has worked for them..

thanx,
rob
