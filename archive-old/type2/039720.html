Subject: AC consoles

happy Friday all,
 I was in the pick a part junk yard (Hayward CA)
 there were two busses with ac units or consoles.
 a 72 with an over head console unit.
that goes behind your head.
 and a 77 with an under the dash unit.
 the 77 is a westy and has most of the bed pads
 there's 1 westy window (I have the other)
the z-bed is in nice shape.
hope some one can use the info.
 have you hugged your VW to day
