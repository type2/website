&gt;         You could order an isolator from JCWipme for about $20 bucks.  It
&gt; is easy to hook up and you could do it yourself.  I did this and it worked
&gt; great for about a year until it burnt out and stopped passing a
&gt; full charge onto the batteries.  A listee from the UK said that he had
similar
&gt; experiences until he paid top dollar for a heavy duty isolator.

The one I got from JCW a few years ago came with instructions to call the
manufacturer for a special diode, and wire the isolater differently, if used
in an old VW.  I did so, and it worked for less than a year and failed.  The
manufacturer exchanged it, the second one failed several month later, then
they exchanged it again and the third one failed.  At this point I bought a
much heavier duty one from an RV place (rated at over 2x the battery
amperage), and it, too, failed after several months.  I don't know why the
failure rate was so high, but at around that time I sold the bus anyway,
sans isolator, so it became a moot point for me.
