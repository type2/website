Subject: impromptu AIRS at the mini dump

didnt work today so I decided to drag some detritus to the mini-dump.
so I toss the stuff and get ready to drive off when a guy walks up to me
and asks if I know any VW mechanics that could help him with his 71 westy
which wouldnt start on him one day and now has been sitting for a couple
of years...
he tells me his name is bob, and I gave him my email and told him to
contact me and Id come by and try to help him get back on the road.

Funny thing is I remember meeting him a few years ago at a gas station. He
has a white 71 westy which was in pretty decent shape at the time.
He doesnt remember me, i didnt have to ask.
