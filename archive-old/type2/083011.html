Subject: GEX Engine (2)

&gt;&gt;GEX (I presume) installed the shorter style 
generator....This sort of wrong component
installation should not occur.  Makes me worry
about the mileage future.

Usual GEX quality from the reports I've seen on
various VW lists.  It always amuses me when I see
someone advertising &quot;new GEX engine&quot; on a for
sale ad, as if that should impress us.  Let me
guess, the kewl bus in question is sporting a
kewl chrome 009 distributor.

Peace and blessings,
