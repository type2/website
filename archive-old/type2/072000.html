&gt;Hey all,
&gt;
&gt;I've noticed when using the brakes on my '71 that the pedal doesn't want
&gt;to return fully without an assist from my toe. Anyone run across this
&gt;problem or have an idea what to look for?

Yes, I have had this exact problem on my 71.  The solution was to replace
the master cylinder and the power brake booster.  The master cylinder was
leaking into the booster and the brake fluid had destroyed the rubber
diaphram.  That was three years ago and no trouble since then.  Your master
may be fine, though, because brake boosters do just wear out eventually.

Miguel
