&gt;A guy I've been communicating with is selling a bus with a VIN number: 
&gt;2212271111. If memory serves me, this is '71--his title and dash VINs 
&gt;match; I told him to check the one in the engine compartment, but he 
&gt;hasn't gotten back to me on that. 
&gt;
&gt;HOWEVER!!!, the picture doesn't even remotely resemble a '71. MANY too 
&gt;many differences. See what you think:
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;I'm guessing '77 because of the high seats and the sink vent on the 
&gt;driver's side. Ideas appreciated.

     Vin is indeed a '71, but that picture sure isn't. It's at least a 
'75-cabinents don't block the right rear window-and I'm with you in that 
I'd be thinking more along the lines of '77 - '79. Hard for me to tell 
without seeing the Westy interior... If this thing really has a 221 vin 
I'd bet it was someone swapping a '71 VIN tag onto this chassis or 
something. Scary. I think there's another one under the rear seat, might 
want to see if it has a different VIN, and run that number by the local 
police dept...


Peace,
