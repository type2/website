Subject: Re: [T2] weird oil cooler

Thanks for the picture. That one's a keeper. I think
it would work quite well for its limited surface area.
Next step would be to have a few thousand copper
&quot;washers&quot; die cut and slipped over the tube for
additional surface area! It will not diminish oil
pressure to the engine and except in already marginal
cooling situations, it should be above the curve on
positive vs negative cooling. -BaH

&gt; Hi Volks,
 
 Someone sent me a link today wherein I saw the
 strangest oil cooler  
 setup I have ever come across:

 %2036hp%20Okrasa%20rear%203-4%20view.jpg
 
 or http://tinyurl_dot_com/25yv8r
 
 Now, is it just me or is this thing going to require
 major oil  
 pressure to keep oil flowing through it with all the
 bends and drag  
 from the tubing?
 
 But even when you find a way to keep the pressure
 up; the heat from  
 the oil is going directly into the stream of air
 used to cool the  
 engine. Which will make the oil even hotter....

 I think someone wasn't thinking clearly when they
 designed this.
 

&gt; Happy Trails,
