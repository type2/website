Subject: idling problems...

Greetings...

Had a bit of a frustrating experience this weekend.  Pretty much out of
the blue, my 71 bus wouldn't hold an idle.  Normal driving was very smooth
and seemingly unaffected.  However, when idling or coming down to an idle,
the engine died.  

I've checked the brake vacuum line to the intake manifold (at least in the
engine compartment) and it seems to be intact.  Both vacuum lines from my
vacuum advance are in good shape.  My carb is tight on the intake
manifold and all gaskets are in place.  All screws are tight on the carb
and I pulled and cleaned the pilot jet.

My carb (34pict3) is adjusted correctly (or at least correctly enough to
run relatively smoothly before this problem).

Is there any place that I haven't checked or any tests that I could
conduct to determine why I'm not holding an idle?

I've scheduled an appointment with the mechanic on Wed. but I would LOVE
to cancel and fix it myself:)

This was the reason I didn't get down to Puyallup and I'm pretty bummed
about it.  Ah well, maybe people will collect hordes of parts over the
winter and want to sell them for dirt cheap next spring.  Hmmmm..

Have a good day.
