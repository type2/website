Subject: [T2] Re: Why do we paint tin? Hot tin.

On my '79 CA bus, the piece of tin that goes below my CAT converter gets
hot. This piece of tin is about 1/2&quot; from the CAT and surrounds the bottom
half. The end result, is that regular rattle can paint has burned off twice.
I will be try some high temp paint this time.
