Subject: Re: Help!  I can't get my 71 Westy to idle!

Just an idea:  unscrew the idle jet (it's midway down the carb throat on the
right hand side, has a nice big brass head on it pointing directly to the
right (toward the air cleaner), looks like a brass version of a cheesehead
screw (never mind).  Unscrew it, hand onto it as it leaves the carb casting,
take it out and vigorously blow it clean.  Once it looks spotless, put it
back in nice and snug.  A plugged idle valve happens easily, especially with
gas passing through an old tank.  Good luck.
