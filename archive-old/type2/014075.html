Subject: a two part question.  kinda long!

Hello all.  
I have a two part question.  I have recently installed
a pre 67 upright motor in my 72 westie to replace the
original pancake.  I remember some time back hearing
about somebody who made a fiberglass? piece of trim to
seal up the engine compartment.  Does anybody out
there know where this can be found(or have any
suggestions about how to take care of this issue)?

Also, the bus had sat for about a year before I put in
this new motor and I believe that the gas tank is
corroded.  I am definately learning from my mistakes
here.  I figure that I will have to pull the motor
again, get the tank out for some kind of service.  I
used a product once in a motorcycle that was a three
step process of chemicals that cleaned and then sealed
the tank.  Has anybody used anything like this in
their VW tank?

Thanks in advance for your help!!!
