In discussion of books, I can say that I loved Grendel and must read it 
again soon.  Also, Blue Highways is always nice even though it's not 
exactly a guide.  One of these days I'm going to do a blue highways trip 
instead of just short jaunts on little roads with serious driving 
limited to fast interstates- everyone goes to fast one interstates these 
days, anyway.
