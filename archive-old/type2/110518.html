&gt; That was my problem, I was trying to get two out at a time. I have since

&gt; Question: The leaf type spring inside the lower control arm housing was welded
&gt; at one end and the weld itself was broken. Is this something that should be
&gt; replaced if possible or should I just have it welded up and continue to use it.

The weld is only to hold the torsion bundle together for assembly.  No
need to reweld it.  Just use a big rubber band to hold things together
while assembling.  Make sure to keep track of left and right springs, they
don't like to be switched!
