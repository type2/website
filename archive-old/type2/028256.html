Hi Folks,

A friend of mine who has no E-mail asked me to post a query to the list 
regarding a problem we ran into last night.

He had just finished hooking up his VDO tach, oil pressure, and oil temp 
gauges, and wanted to go for a drive.  So, always eager to see how another 
Bus runs, I jumped in and joined him.  All was well during the highway drive 
down to a pleasant back road, and the back road was fun as well.  His Bus is 
very bare-bones and full of rattles, but is pretty solid for as old as it 
is.

Anyway, on the way back up the highway, the Bus began to hesitate, as though 
the throttle was closing temporarily.  It would run fine, then buck, buck, 
buck, and run fine again.  It only seemed to do it around 50-60 mph and 
around 3500-4000rpm, but didn't do it at 3500-4000rpm in other gears.

His 69 Bus basically has a new drivetrain.  A new 1600dp single-carb engine, 
a new 002 (?) transmission, new clutch, new CVs.  One problem is that his 
Bowden Tube is attached to a rusty part of his frame (?), and may be flexing 
excessively, so his clutch may be slipping.

When I listened to his engine while the problem was happening, the RPMs 
didn't seem to be changing, and there were no unusual noises, either.  
Thinking it over myself, I think it's ignition related -- possibly a bad 
coil, bad wires, bad plugs.  It might also be related to the new gauges, but 
can't think of exactly what that would be.

My friend and I thank you all for any help you can offer.
