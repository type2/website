Subject: Re:[T2] Type 2 in France and Switzerland

Hi I'm new here, but I have a number of brochures dating from the 1970's for
Devon Conversions a British Company. In them, they state that the 1600cc
engine came as standard and the 2000cc engine was the optional extra.

An 1976 example of cost:-
VW Continental (Westy) on the road was #4474.61 for the 1600cc.
The 2000cc option an extra #336.09
and the Automatic 2000cc option #282.21.
These had to ordered from the factory (i.e. VW via Devon ) before conversion
could take place.

I have a 1641cc, but there are many vans in the U.K. that have 1700cc and
2000cc engines in them, and I seem to remember that around 1975 the British
Goverment was planning to start Petrol Rationing and issued Ration cards.
Here in the U.K. fuel costs and the moment are the highest yet at 92p per
litre that works out at about #4.38 per Gal. or $8.44 US or approx. $100 per
tank. Gulp!!!!.
