&gt;	- How can you tell if a transaxle CV joint boot (not sure if this
&gt;is VW lingo ... my father said this is what they were called when he
&gt;worked on them) is bad and/or needs to be replaced?  The boot on the right
&gt;side of the bus was cracked and we fear that it will lose grease soon.  Is
&gt;it a major problem to replace these?  If labor is the main thing then I'm
&gt;not incredibly worried ... money is the main issue.

If the boot is cracked/torn you should replace it. you can get boot kits
that come with new boot/bolts/grease for ~$10. While replacing the boot,
you'll want to clean and inspect the CV itself. If they need replacing they
aren't cheap. think i paid $45 each for new ones....mostly labor involved
so long as the CV's still have life in them. be sure you clean out the bolt
holes before trying to remove them. if you don't you increase the chances
of stripping them and then having more work getting them out.....
(dont ask how i know:(


&gt;	- We found that the cooling system had been removed from the
&gt;engine - there aren't any flaps, linkages, cables or a thermostat.  How
&gt;much difficulty is it to replace all of this, and are the parts available?
&gt;We just glanced in &quot;The Bus Depot&quot; catalog and didn't see the necessary
&gt;parts ... are there resources for this type of thing?  And would I have
&gt;problems this winter if I don't fix it?

If my bus was missing these parts I would find the parts and install them.
Especially if I was about to install a rebuilt engine.
some on the list will insist you don't need it. others will insist you do.
junkyards are the best source of replacements. new thermostats arent too 
expensive.



&gt;	- How do we set the timing for the engine?  We assumed that there
&gt;would be a cap in the fan belt housing unit, so that we could make the
&gt;adjustment ... but, we didn't see one.  We have been using a few books for
&gt;this rebuild, and each book suggested that we would find this cap, but we
&gt;didn't.  Is this strange?

on the cooling fan at the rear of the engine there should be a scale in
the 9oclock to 12oclock position. If you don't have one you need to get one.
others on the list can probably tell you how to set timing without the scale.



&gt;	- And last - but not least - what is the best solvent for cleaning
&gt;and degreasing the engine parts?  We don't want a water based cleanser,
&gt;for fear of rusting, but don't want to use something like gasoline, for
&gt;obvious reasons.

I used SimpleGreen(tm) and lotsa elbow grease to clean my engine tin, etc...
before sanding/primering/painting it.

hope that helps a little, good luck with the bus!
