&gt; Real quick- no, there will be some modifications

&gt; 1/2&quot; longer than the 002 version.

True but modifications sound pretty extreem...  Basically it is a bolt 
in job for the transaxle.   you need to readjust the shift rod (let it 
slip together and redrill the hole in the rod) where it joins behind the 
drivers area (under the bus of course) by the amount the newer 
transaxle rod is longer.  make sure you keep all the angles correct.
If you are serious about this I may be able to dig up some more 
info.

As for the 2.0 you need to migrate all the mount hardware with it.  
Its been a while so I dont remember just why but there were slight 
differences.
