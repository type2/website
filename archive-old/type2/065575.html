Subject: VW humor

Up here in Kodiak there is a bar that bills itself the smallest bar in the
world. Last year a customer fell short of his tab, and the bar owner took
the guy's Beetle as a security. Not only did he take the Beetle, but he had
it lifted onto the roof of this very small building, and began charging rent
for the space. The VW was up there for about 3 months and then, I believe,
sold. Sure was fun while it lasted ...
