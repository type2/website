&gt; 1) Is this better left to a machine shop? Or can the average rebuilder

I really don't know if I happened to be lucky, but I drilled/tapped
out all the plugs on my engine. This was on the engine stand
completely dissembled.
 
&gt; 2) Which are the gallery plugs that should be replaced? How many behind 
&gt; the flywheel?

I just went ahead and replaced any gallery plug with a threaded plug.
I happened to buy the brass ones, but IIRC Ronnie at Old Volks carries
the alunumum ones. I don't remember how many but pretty sure I used
two different sizes.

&gt; 3) What keeps the plugs from loosening up with vibration? The sealer?

I think the sealer will help, but also it's a tapered NPT thread, so
it gets tighter itself.
