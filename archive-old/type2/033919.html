Subject: cats in buses camping ???? + snow?

hi all delete if no interest in cats or  driving in snow- sorry for 
the waste of bandwith

i have been away from the list for over two months due to breaking my 
arm and other problems. But now i am back and its time for holidays 
once again.  The bus made her first journey today for 2 months today 
and went into Volkspares for a check up before i set off at the 
weekend.

Anyway i have a question i would appreciate feedback, and tips and hints on.

At the weekend i am due to set off for a three week holiday in the 
bus - combining camping, travelling with visiting relatives and 
friends.  However the person who usually feeds my cat whilst i am 
away in the bus, is unable to - it seems nobody wants to be in 
london, UK,  over the millenium festivities.

Anyway i recall reading on the list of various of you, who have 
travelled and camped with a cat in the bus.  So i was wondering if 
this is a feasible option.  What happens when you camp, don't they 
run away, or do you just keep them on a lead?  what about litter 
trays - i thought about putting it on the floor in the passenger side 
of the cab over night?  I will buy a big cage for her to sit in 
whilst driving for safety reasons. or   is taking a cat away in a bus 
a really stupid idea????

I will be travelling up to the Peak District (ie the middle spine of 
the English countryside, for those not from the `UK) and camping for 
a few nights and then over to visit various family menbers in the 
north west at xmas and then on the the Lake District to camp and 
visit relatives over the new year.


This raises another problem.  The weather has been very snowy ( i say 
*very* in an english context - i know  our level of snow is nothing 
to you in more extreme climates).   The forcast for sunday is for 
more snow in the Peaks and the Lake District.   I have never driven 
the bus in snow.  How do busses handle in  snow?  I know the heat (or 
lack of it) whilst driving and camping may also be a problem but i 
have camped in a tent in snow before now so can cope with my two sets 
of thermals and many pairs of socks - plus the cat will be a good hot 
water bottle!!

So my main concern about the snow is driving in it - that is provided 
the roads in the peaks / lakes are not blocked.


Any tips and advice appreciated, plus suggestions for wonderfull 
places to camp if anyone has any......

glad to be back
