Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] new factory 1600DP motors??

Yes, they do. My compadre, Scott has had the nickel-tour there this past
year while initiating parts tooling with his China contacts for lots of new
Bug &amp; Bus stuff in the pipeline for VWG &amp; Airhead Parts. Most of the
production is for parts used elsewhere for their assembly lines elsewhere in
the world. But I imagine they have (or will have) a vehicle assembly line up
and running.
