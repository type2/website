&gt; Hey Tyler,
&gt;
&gt; That's great Tyler?  Do you know how many miles are on the engine so far?
&gt; We *on the list* can use yours as the next GEX test engine, to see how long
&gt; it will last.
&gt;
&gt; If you plan to take a long trip you might want to do what I did once on a
&gt; trip to the tip of Baja Mexico It was in the summer of 1985 ( 100 degrees
&gt; in the shade) in a 69 Westy with a newly installed GEX motor in it.
&gt;
&gt; I carried an extra engine with me, and when the GEX engine blew about 100km
&gt; from Santa Rosalia Mex. I was able to pull over set up camp drop the GEX
&gt; and install the new motor. to get back on with my trip.......

Well luckily the previous owner had a lot of receipts in the bus. It now 
looks like maybe the GEX motor was replaced in 1996 with a motor from a 
reputable VW shop.
