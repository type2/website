Subject: 2.0 FI Again

From what I have now heard, I started to look for the
cly head temp #3 (Temp sensor 2 I assume), but I could
not find it where the manual states....between the
intake flange and the spark plug hole of cylinder #3. 
I did however find the wire that I assume should
connect to it.  I can't for the life of my figure out
where to hook it up.  The only thing I see that could
be this sensor is just on the firewall side of the
distributor, and it is already hooked up (could be
wrong)

Off on a limb, the PO said that he had a cylinder head
rebuilt, and when looking throught the #3 spark plug
hole, I see a very clean cylinder head so I assume
that's the one.  My question is, when the work was
done, could they have put different engine tin in and
forgotten to hook up the sensor?  Just grabbing at
straws.
