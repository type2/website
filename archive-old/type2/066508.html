Woohoo!  I had this engine in a Ford Taunus when I lived in Germany, and I
have to say, it is a sweet motor.  Not terribly powerful, but smooth,
quiet, and reliable.  I believe it has a short stroke, because that puppy
would rev like there was no tomorrow.  Pushed the 4-door Taunus up to
175km/hr.  After 150km/hr I could no longer hear the engine, and I didn't
have a tach.  I just stood on it till it wouldn't go any faster.  Thought
it would blow up, but it never did. :-)
That motor pulled me and two friends on an 18,000km trip around Europe and
never let us down.  I've even got pictures of when I swapped the engine
into the Taunus.  It looks a lot like the 2.8, of course...
