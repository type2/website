Thanks for the reply Tom. I'm still trying to decide. Another couple 
questions that folks might want answers to (sorry to be a pain, but this 
is a great forum for this dialog: talking about safety issues about this 
heater and all propane devices is a good thing):

- -Is this an open flame heater or some kind of catalytic heater?
- -What about warranty?

A question for all the heater buyers:

- -Are you planning on running it whilst driving, or only stopped?

Here's what I'm wondering:

I'm not so worried about having a small propane tank in the car. The tanks
are not that likely to rupture (especially if anchored in a good place). I
would also plan on having both a CO and propane detector in the van, as
running the heater at night while asleep would be desirable (both sold by
Whitney). 

The question in my mind is: What happens if there is an accident? Regardless
of where the tank is located, there are hoses, valves, etc. coming into the
car. I would think it more likely for a hose to be ruptured by a flying
object than for a small steel tank to be injured. Westphalia buses and RV's
have plumbed propane inside, so maybe this isn't really a worry. What does
this heater do in the event of a crash? Is that what flame monitoring 
is? What if it gets damaged? 

Just want to be warm, and safe,

Jon
