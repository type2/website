Subject: [T2] Cap Nuts (Oil Plate/Strainer Cover Nuts)


&gt; I'm having a tough time finding these things for my '70 loaf.  I did
&gt; find them at aircooled_dot_net for $2 each, however!  Yikes!  $12 seems kind
&gt; of high for six cap nuts.  Anyone out there have a better source for
&gt; these nuts?

I think you'd be better off using regular or nylock nuts, read an article
that stated the cap nuts put repeated stress on the studs and fatiguing
them, besides being easier to find a regular nut
