&gt; &gt; and blueprinting makes the tolerance window much much smaller, remember I
&gt; &gt; said I had my engine 1gram balanced, so the tolerance is one gram.  etc.

&gt; I suspect that the 750 HP, 20,000 RPM Cosworth F1 V8's tolerance window
&gt; is much, much, much smaller... ;-)

I suspect you are very right, and as I mentioned earlier balancing and
blueprinting have diminishing returns, the tighter the tolerances the more
expensive the process and the less you get for each increment, I chose
1gram because that was what I thought was the best I could afford for the
use I planned on giving my engine.

in Bentley pg 80-87 is a long list of tolerances and wear limits.  you can
find that pistons have a 4gram new 10gram worn balance limit. in the case
of my engine I balanced to 1gram not 4gram during rebuild so I paid more.
double the price I could have gotten 1/2 gram, double it again and get 1/4
gram etc...

as someone else said when you get it &quot;Blueprinted&quot; you better find out
what the builder &quot;Rreally&quot; means by that.

balancing though is basically for the moving parts, you don't baalance a
bearing, but you can blueprint a bearing but at what tolerance. the Type
IV main bearing journnal is 59.97-59.99  but you could spec it
59.98-59.90 a much tighter spec and you would pay dearly for it.

only you can determine what is &quot;good enough&quot; for you and your needs, as
was said by someone else there is no &quot;Perfect&quot; because we don't have tools
to measure that.
