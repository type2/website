  I got one of these from Ron and it is nice looking etc. BUT while the
cam comes out like it is supposed to, with a little wiggling I can still
get the gas cap off in the locked position.

This is NOT critical of Bus Depot, I got the order in less time than was
promised and everything was there, the gas cap was exactly as Ron
advertised, it just doesn't lock the cap on.

oh well it still looks better than the one that was on there
