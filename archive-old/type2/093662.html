&gt; Question 2:  We hooked the city water up to the camper and that seemed 
&gt; to
&gt; work more or less OK, except the faucet &quot;off&quot; position wouldn't really 
&gt; turn
&gt; the water off, just &quot;down.&quot;  I know we have very high pressure where we
&gt; live, but I'd guess this should work better.  Are there any replaceable
&gt; parts inside this faucet that might fix this situation?
There are in line pressure reducer valves available from rv places.
I think gowesty_dot_com has a rebuild kit for the faucet as well.
&gt;
&gt; Question 3: According to the '81 camper supplement manual I found on 
&gt; the
&gt; 'net there's supposed to be a vent for the internal water tank.  The 
&gt; manual
&gt; has a photo of it and it looks like it should be on the left side of 
&gt; the
&gt; van, but I can't find it!  Where the heck is the water tank vent on an 
&gt; '82
&gt; Westy?
vent or drain.  there is a drain on the underside right below the water 
tank.  same for the sink the drain i right under the sink .
