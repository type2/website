&gt; &lt;&lt;The VW's oiling system is based on pressure, NOT TEMPERATURE. if you

&gt; what happens to your oil temps?&gt;&gt; 

&gt; Your 15 /50 is more than likely 10/40 at that point.

well unless it is a quality synthetic which will not break down at that
point or temp.

&gt; &lt;&lt;Most (not all) VW owners are ignorant about the way the VW engine
&gt; TRULY operates, and if someone tells you to run straight weights, they
&gt; better have a real good reason.&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Funny thing---
&gt; on page 52 of my 1974 VW owner's manual is mentions;
&gt; 
&gt; Hot season--SAE 40
&gt; Cool season--SAE 30
&gt; Summer--SAE 30
&gt; Winter-above 5 degree--SAE 20w 20
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&lt;The FACTORY recommends multigrade's--&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I must have been reading a Citron owner's manual here----or somehow the
&gt; factory owner's manual I have must be a           misprint.

well may I suggest the Bentley manual, Chapter 9 pg 4 section 2 which
begins &quot;because of the recent improvemnets in the quality of commercially
avaliable lubricating oils, COMPLETELY NEW OIL RECOMMENDATIONS for VW cars
became effective in 1975.......You will find, however that there are many
advantages to be gained in adopting the new recommendations, ONLY the new
oil reccommendations given in this manual should be applied to 1975 and
later VW's&quot;  

&quot;single grade engine oils such as SAE 30 WERE FORMERELY recommended for
use in VW engines because of the unreliable quality of the then avaliable
multi grade engine oils. The new high standard for engine oils that
conform to the API service rating API/SE has made such multi grade oils
suitable for use in the VW engine, Car owners will find that these high
quality multi grade oils offer many advantages in convience, performance,
and economy - EVEN IN OLDER MODEL VW's&quot;  

  Table &quot;a&quot; on page 5 shows many multigrades,.including a 15w-50 which as
far as I know is (was) only avaliable as a synthetic.
