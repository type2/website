Hey Jason  I agree with this  I have to fix these all the time where these 
monkeys screw up.   If these guys were real mechnics they wouldnt be working in 
a Jiffy lube would they.??   I had a BMW come in with an oil leak an one of 
these places put a molly type plug in the drain hole, crazy thing was that it 
wasnt stripped ??  just had to get a bolt and sealing ring to fix it  later
