Subject: bad fuel filter reactions 

ok i have a nasty fuel filter i just changed,,,,
what would be the results of a dirty fuel filter..?
 
reason i ask is the bus was acting funny today....
keeps acting like she wants to cut off while in like 2nd or third and at the red lights...
she is idleing fine and then she starts to bog down... also while driving she seemed to do a little slight bucking here and there... like something clogged up was my assumption...?
 
while on the highway though afterwards she did fine or seemed to.(before i changed the fuel filter).... after i got off onto the exit ramp(after being on the highway) i noticed it started back again....but not as bad...even though i rushed to the parts store picked up 2 filters and went home... changed filter(other as a spare) will try a test drive tomorrow after i pull the plugs and see what they look like..again... .?
 
the fuel filter was way over due to be changed... 
 
i would just like to know if this could be a cause for my problem..?
 
hoping my intuition was right...
peace
chris
