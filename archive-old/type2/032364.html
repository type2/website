Subject: sliding window source?
Message-ID: &lt;Springmail.104.939219339.0.21472000_at_www.springmail_dot_com&gt;

We just installed a sliding side window in our '72
Bus, which came with another Bus we bought last year.
Now we'd like to get one for the other side, but
can't seem to find one.  I've checked various parts
suppliers on the web, but haven't found one.

Does anyone know of a source for these windows?

Thanks
Dave
