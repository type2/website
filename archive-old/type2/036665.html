Subject: Re: 76 Westy wiring for trailer??

Matt,
There is a special converter you may need depending on how your trailer lights
are wired.  The bus has tail lights that combine the brake and tail light in
one bulb while the turn signal light is a separate bulb.  Trailer lights
usually use a single bulb for brake, tail, and turn.  You can either use the
converter (available at most any FLAPS) or wire in separate lights on the
trailer.
As far as I know there is no quick-connect for wiring trailer lights to the
back of a bus.  You have to tap into the tail light wires yourself.  This is
easy if you have a light tester.  Just look at the back side of your tail
lights and try to figure out which wire goes to the turn signal.  Turn that
turn signal on and probe around with your test light to confirm or deny your
deduction.  You may have to stab the tester through the insulation of the wire
to test it, but try to avoid this if you can as it creates a place for
potential corrosion to enter and attack the wires.    You will need to make a
connection for each turn light and one connection each for the brake and tail
lights.  Any FLAPS should also carry wire connectors that make it real easy to
tap wires into an existing circuit.
Also, you may have to replace your flasher relay with a heavy duty flasher
relay.  You'll know you need one if your turn signals flash faster than normal
when you have the trailer hooked up.  The FLAPS should also carry this part.
I tuck my trailer wiring harness into the engine compartment when I don't have
the trailer hooked up.  When I hook up the trailer I just pull it out and
carefully close the engine compartment lid onto the harness.

Good Luck,

&gt; Hello Everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I have just purchased a trailer and hitch for my 1976 VW westy. I need to
&gt; wire the van for the trailer lights now. Anyone ever do this? Where are the
&gt; connections? Any special adapters needed? Also if someone has a wiring
&gt; diagram I would love to get a copy.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
