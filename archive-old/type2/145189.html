Subject: 78 Bus Opening fuel rail, need to block anything off

Hi All,

I changed all my fuel lines a few months ago. Now I am
going
to swap out my injectors for some that have been
reworked
by cruzinperformance.

My question is -- can I just remove the injectors and
fuel rail
inside the bus, or do I need to be worried about
plugging up
the fuel outlet and/or fuel return lines so that I am
not flooded
with gas. Ideally, it would be nice not to have to
drain the tank
and not to have to worry about blocking stuff off.

Any help, appreciated as usual!!

Thanks
