coulda sworn i just went over this... check the archives for my post...
specific to your application, you just hook all the neg (not ground, they
are called pos and neg in stereo apps.) speaker wires to the one neg coming
out of the deck. it is a common negative connection and as long as you have
all the pos. from the speakers hooked up correctly it will work. happy 8
tracking.

Subject: 3 Speakers; 1 Ground Wire???


&gt; Re-Greetings*  (No, sir George Lyle, I do *not* know how the speakers go!
:)
&gt;
&gt;   After much ado, Ramona's new 8track stereo is mostly installed! I would
&gt; rather wrestle ole Jesse Ventura than go at it with the fuse block again.
&gt; That really sucked.
&gt;   However! I even managed to hook up the wire that allows the digital
clock
&gt; to keep time while the cars off! (It, of course, remains to be seen
whether
&gt; or not the battery's dead tomorrow morning...)
&gt;   Okay, so, I thought that hooking up the speakers would be the easy part.
&gt; Why do I always do that? Yeah, so, it's not, at least according to me.
&gt;   There are wires coming from the harness to support 4 speakers; left
front,
&gt; right front, left rear, right rear, BUT! there is only the ONE ground
wire!
&gt; How do you use just one ground wire to travel to each speaker? I hooked
just
&gt; the one under dash speaker up to test the stereo sound (gotta brief
&gt; smattering of &quot;Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me&quot;, and I smiled.), but I
can't
&gt; live with just that one! It's the original and doesn't give much.
&gt;   Plus, there are only 3 speakers (one front, two back)...does that
matter?
&gt;   Anyhow, if someone could let me know how I go about using just the one
&gt; ground wire for all the speakers, I'd be ever so obliged. I'd really like
to
&gt; have some tunes on the way to work tomorrow, and I wanna get this done
before
&gt; my Super Bowl-Bound Miami Dolphins (Go, Dan!!) whup up on some Buffalo
Butt
&gt; on Monday Night Football!
&gt;   Have we told you lately that we love you all? Well, we do, big, big, and
&gt; surely appreciate any ideas you might have for us!
&gt; Thanks*

&gt; wiring!
