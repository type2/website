Subject: weird headlight related problem

This is the second time the following has happened.

I get in the van, start it up, turn on the lights
and I get all lights except main head lights.  I get all the
driving lights except the 2 big round eyes :)

Fuses are good etc.  The first time the van had sat at work
and I drove home not realizing they were not on.. just before
dusk and I pulled over near home and somehow they came on.
I checked fuses and generally banged around.

Last nite after hockey they again wouldn't come on.  Tried
to copy my behavior but no go. One of the other players stayed right
ahead of me and I made it home. This morning they came on like
normal.

Is there a relay or something a person should check.. ideas?
