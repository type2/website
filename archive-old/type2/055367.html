&gt; What hitches have what mount points? Pictures? Close-ups?

some years ago I bought a bumper hitch from a rental place, same hitch you
get when you rent a U-Haul and such, just put it on when I need it and
take it off otherwise.  have probably overloaded it a few times hauling
stuff to the dump.

Just make sure your bumper mounts are solid
