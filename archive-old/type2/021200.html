I found Redline yesterday at Kohlweiss in Redwood City.  What a parts
store!  It's gorgeous and seems to have absolutely EVERYTHING.  With my
mechanic pal's discount I was able to pick up a complete set of
hydraulic lifters for the '79 for just a buck more each than bus depot!

What a concept!  A local vendor that actually HAS parts.
