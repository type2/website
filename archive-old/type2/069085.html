Subject: 14&quot; mags on my 71 parts bus

HEy guys,

Ive got a question. I recently bought a 71 bus (disc brakes, small 5 lug 
bolt pattern) for parts. It has slotted aluminum (magnesium?)  mags on 
it, the kind you would find on a Datsun Z car or Ford pinto, etc.  The 
wheels are dished with 5 slotted holes. My question is, are these rims 
nicer than stock for any reason? They are something like 14&quot;x5&quot;or 6&quot;. The 
offset might be such that they stick out a little farther than the stock 
rims (PO of 71 parts bus put on slight fender flares -yuck!) I personally 
like the look of the stock rims with the trash can lid 
hubcaps and in fact, my personal favorite are the pre-71 rims with the 
really big hubcaps. Where is this going? I am removing the 69 suspension 
on my bus and putting on the 71 suspension with 71 brakes. So, I need to 
figure out an option with the wheels. As I see it, I have three options:
 
1&gt; use the slotted mags that came with bus ( do you guys think these are 
        nice looking? opinions welcomed)

2&gt; use stock 71 rims (small lug pattern on 71 suspension)
        (I currently do not own a stock set of 71 rims, so would have to buy)

3&gt; use adaptors or something and put 69 rims on 71 suspension.
        (Could I use a piece of steel and make my own adapters? Ihave the
         machining capability, but would there be a really big problem?)
        Again opinions welcomed

Thanks IN advance (I love doing things the long way ;)
