Subject: repair a cracked EGR valve

When I removed the EGR valve from my engine, I found two problems. One of
its  flanges had cracked into two pieces.  And there was a hole about 3mm x
7mm, presumably having been eaten away by hot exhaust gases.

I'd like to fill the hole and reattach the flange. For the hole, it has to
fill the gap without pushing through to the inside and obstructing flow.
For the flange, it must be an adhesive with modest strength because the
flanges are pulled together with bolts

Could you all give some suggestions on what adhesive/filler to use?
Epoxy? JB Weld?  POR 15 filler?

.

Thanks, Jack
