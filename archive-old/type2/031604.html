Hi doktor,

Read excerpts from my original message below, perhaps they are unclear,
but, as i said,  I did have my shortblock assembled by a machinist, and i
*do* have the tools and skills neccecary to assemble a stock shortblock,
where i got lost was when the case needed to be clearanced for a nonstock
item, so I took it to experts to have it assembled/clearanced.

But, turns out after they dissassembled the shortblock it was probably my
fault.  Best guesses are that the oil pump is not good (new but with the
quality of parts thses days they wish to measure it and verify that
it is proper.) OR, and I am ashamed to admit it, I used a used doghouse
cooler, and they think it may have had metal bits in it. Hopefully others
may learn from my pain on this item.

It was your standard spun #1 main, low oil pressure or bits of gack most
likely the cause.

This time, I will personally assemble, check all tolerances and take
advice that was given to use a new or *known* good oil cooler. The old one
will be repeatedly molested with a hammer and put in the circular parts
receptacle.

take care,

Steve
