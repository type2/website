Subject: Looking for a Gas Tank

Well..my mechanic just informed me I am soon 
going to be needing a new gas tank for my '76 Westy. He does'nt know how hard it is going to be to find one so I figured I'd look to. Does anyone
know where I might find a new or used(preferably used) Gas Tank? Any help is apprecitated. Please email me directly if you have any info.

Thanks
