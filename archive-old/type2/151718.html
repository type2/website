 Ron, can I suggest one more improvement for your next run? If it would not 
 hurt the rigidity and stability too much, could they cut a notch down each 
 side to accommodate a coffee mug handle? Most of my &quot;car cups&quot; have handles 
 and I am always looking for a good cup holder that will hold a cup with a 
 handle.
&gt; 
&gt; I may still buy one as soon as I move to Florida. Having a cool drink 
&gt; nearby is a survival issue there...
