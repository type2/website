&gt;&gt; If whoever is looking for the green/yellow gets in touch with me I think

&gt;&gt; Proper color for '76-'78 or so Marigold westy's (school bus
&gt;&gt; yellow standard westy's.)

&gt;Actually, I have some of this as well.  About half a roll remaining, maybe
&gt;less.  I don't think it's on my website, so mostly it gets sold to people
&gt;who call and ask if  I have it.  I've been selling a section large enough to
&gt;recover either 2 front seats, or the rear seat bottom and back (but not rear
&gt;mattress), for $99.

Wow at that price my remaining stock is probably worth $3000, and what
Dolan has is easily worth $500.  Like I said folks this stuff is rare.
I wouldn't mind trading a full bus worth for a bus worth of the brown/beige/
black/green found in '78 and '79 Champagne and beige deluxe FWIW if
anyone has any of that new.  That is the only color they but in the late
Bus westy I think has even a modicum of taste.

Somebody better take Steve up on the $12/yard.
