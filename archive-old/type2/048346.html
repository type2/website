&gt;       Well, here i am with no brake lights and no turn signals, so I guess I
&gt; need to try the pressure switch, right????


Hi Jon,


Are you sure the ground-wire in the rear light-units is working well? It
often is corroded, then no current will pass through the lights.
Otherwise, check the connections on the pressure switch. Last option:
pressure switch is broken.

To check if your pressure switch is out of order connect the two wires
that fit to the switch. If they are connected to each other the brake
lights should light up (when your ignition is on). If they don't, the
problem is somewhere else.
