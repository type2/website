&gt;My wife and I have been talking about living in a bus next fall in
&gt;Spain.  The &quot;too much stuff&quot; issues seems unlikely, given the limits on
&gt;airline luggage.  One big issue, on the face of it, is the question of
&gt;where to clean one's body.

In a pinch I find that I feel pretty good after washing my hair in a
sinkful of water - as for the rest of me a hot bowl full of soapy water and
a sponge work pretty well.  Not as pleasant as a shower though.  I have to
say that having the highroof camper is great for stealth camping - I could
park at Hollywood and Vine, pull the curtains and get clean right there.
BTW if anyone is looking for a highroof camper, I know a guy that has an 86
Adventurewagen highroof for sale here in Dallas.  Fully equipped, with
fridge, stove, heater, etc. for around $5500.  A great deal if you ask me,
and a rare bus.  E-mail me for his phone number.  I would buy it myself but
I'm not ready to trade in my bay window for a Vanagon just yet.  :)

If you're near a beach there is bound to be a public shower somewhere
around somewhere - I have used these and they are great except that they
usually have only cold water - sure wakes you up in the morning.  I have
also snuck into a couple of KOA's for a quick hot shower - I've stayed
there enough times at $18+ per night without using their facilities that I
figure they owe me a shower or two.  If you can find a secluded spot, solar
showers work great.  Wear your swimsuit, pop the hatch, put solar shower on
hatch, put folding wooden slat thingey (get it at Camping world another
camping store) down on the ground to keep your feet clean, and have at it.
Use biodegradeable soap please.

Appliances.  I had to go to dinner once when I was on a long trip and I had
to look and smell decent.  I stopped in a Wal Mart parking lot and pulled
the curtains.  Washed my hair in the sink and blew it dry with a little
travel blow dryer I found at Sharper Image - it's about 500 watts which
runs on my 600 watt inverter.  Not much velocity but it gets the job done.
I shaved with an electric razor and ironed my clothes on the table (on a
towel) with a travel iron that only draws 400 watts - again it runs great
on the inverter - works suprisingly well considering the wattage.  I guess
I would say that if you're going to live in your bus, an inverter is almost
a necessity.  If you have the battery power, a bigger inverter (1500 Watt)
would be ideal since you could use normal household appliances with it, for
a few minutes at a time at least.  The 600 watt unit I have is kind of
small, but it was cheap and I was able to find low wattage appliances to
use with it.
