Subject: Engine Rattles on a cold start!!

Hey guys,

    I very infrequently drive my VW Bus. It's not because I don't like
it, but because I refuse to drive it in the rain, I don't like to drive
it on really hot days (for the motor's sake, not mine), etc. So it's
really only on the weekends, and going to the beach. So it just stays in
the garage 99% of the time.

With that in mind, there will often be times where it gets started maybe
once a month. Often when I do this, ALL the oil has drained out of my
hydraulic lifters. Just as an FYI, it's a 1.8, with the single 2-bbl
progressive webber (with the long tube-runners), and hydraulic lifters.
It kills me when I start the Bus, and I hear rattling for a few minutes.
The oil light goes off instantly when I start the car, so I know that
I've got good oil pressure. I have NO oil leaks, transmission leaks, or
any leaks of any kind on this Bus. (a testament to the engineering of the
block, despite it's age). What can I do to prevent this, or is this ok?
I'm guessing it does this because the lifters sit on their sides, so
therefore all the oil drains out. 
I imagine this probably isn't the best thing for the Bus either.

I use Castrol 10W-30 Synthetic motor oil. You know, the one with the wax
APOs in it.. or whatever it's called. The motor and transmission were
rebuilt about... ~5 years ago, but it has less than 1000 miles on it. It
was broken in about 5 years ago, and then sat in a warehouse for about 4
years when I then purchased it. I've put about 300 miles on it since I've
owned it.



Thanks,

Todd
