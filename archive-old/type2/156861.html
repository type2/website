&gt; Hey Chris,

&gt; I'm down in Fairfield County and can only find those CARB gas cans...  in
&gt; fact, I thought CT was a CARB state.  So, where did you find a usable gas
&gt; can?

Is it the can, or the spout?  Can the spout be modified into something
usable?

My larger gas cans don't have a separate vent.  They have a little tube
inside the larger nozzle that extends down into the can several inches.
This provides the vent when the can is inverted.

I think the black market will be in nozzles, not in cans.  I have a
feeling that &quot;water cans&quot; will become much more popular in the future.
