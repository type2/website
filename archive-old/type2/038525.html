Subject: Brake job

Started on my brakes last night.  Thought it would be a simple bleed, but
nooooooooooo.  The wheels cylinders leak like a spaghetti strainer.
Remember, I am the guy who is resurrecting a Westy that sat for 10 years.  I
guess I will replace the lines while I am at it.  Took a look at the axles
and every cv boot is cracked.  One was held together with chicken wire.
Will I ever get this project road worthy?  I hope so.  How can I tell if I
can use the axles again?  Should I just buy some boots and see how they pan
out?  How much are new axles or joints?  I am going to use my Westy to
travel all across the US when it is finished so I might as well just replace
them.  I named him/her too.  I name thee &quot;Casper&quot; the ghost white Westy  : )
