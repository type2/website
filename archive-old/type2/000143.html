Hello,
  I'm Ed Dvorak. I'm sorry to get my message on the list this way but either 
my computer (which is almost as old as my &quot;new Bus&quot; ) or I am malfunctioning 
but I just cannot seem to navigate the website. So I'm tagging on to this 
message in hopes that you can forward it to the rest of the mailing list.
   My bus was born a '73 passenger van according to the data plate info 
behind the seat. However, somewhere along the line an attempt at a camper 
conversion has been visited upon the poor machine. What I have now is a &quot;tie 
on&quot; top with some random holes drilled to accept the broken hinges on the 
camper top. The sliding hard top that I've been told belongs there is long 
gone as well as ALL of the associated hardware/software.
   Is there anyone out there that can help me find the stuff I need to 
restore him  to the way he was born. Preferrably in the northeast but If the 
price isn't too bad I'll try anywhere. Meanwhile I'm working on the 
exhaust/heating system and the body. He's got some rustthru in the forward 
end of the cabin but nothing serious.
     On the up side he runs good and strong  and is mechanically sound. 
Sorry to get so long winded about my problems. 
Thanks 
Ed Dvorak
