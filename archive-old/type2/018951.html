&gt; Well, I found an automotive machinist in Roseburg who seems to be up to the
&gt; job of doing the delicate parts of my rebuild. He's a nice guy, straight
&gt; forward, and works on aircooled VWs all the time. He even let me look at
&gt; his equipment and some heads that were part way done, and he's been open in
&gt; that spot for 30 years. He also quoted me $350 - $600 depending, and will
&gt; tear it down and inspect it for me for next to nothing. We talked for half
&gt; an hour about engine pulling in Type II's.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, am wondering about the issue of valve seats that everyone talks about.
&gt; As I follow it, there's some kind of modification that is important to make
&gt; in the process of rebuilding the heads. What exactly should be done to the
&gt; head to help prevent the dropped valve seats? Or is this more a matter of
&gt; opinion? I should have asked him about what he usually does, but for some
&gt; reason it didn't occur to me.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.

Machine shops that do air-cooled motors have been installing seats since
Hector was a pup and mostly they stay in. Mark Stephens claims to have
found the Holy Grail of Valve Seats. I think it's probably just hype.
