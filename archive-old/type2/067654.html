This sounds pretty good, but isn't synthetic a bad idea in older motor?  I
think we covered this issue a while ago, and discussion seemed to center
on the fact that old motor leak, and synthetic contribute to this leakage
by causing the seals to contract (actually they don't expand as much with
synthetic as with dino-oil).

SInce I personally keep the oil manufacturers in business with the leaks
on my bus, I wouldn't want to pay twice as much just to pour it on the
ground :)
