You'll likely get a few responses like this one... In almost all the manuals
they will suggest strongly that the FI is almost never the cause of a
missfire or hesitation. It may add to the percieved problem but most likely
isn't the cause of it. This AFM thing bears this out.

However the ignition system is almost always the first place to look. Carbon
tracking on the cap would cause erratic shuddering, inconsistent
missing/hesitation. I too have gone through this. I found out the local
FLAPS has the wrong cap and rotor combo listed for the 79 van. After I
corrected this, carbon tracking on the inside of the cap has not been a
problem.

With my CDI ignition, if the points are set right at .16 I will get erratic
shuddering occasionally at cruising speed but almost never at load going up
a hill. So, I opened em up to .18 and stopped that one.

Plug wires might also be something to look at.

Hope this helps, if not, let me know what did, and best of luck!!!

&gt;HI folks
&gt;
&gt;I've been browsing you archives and I've found a lot of references
&gt;to a problem of erractic shuddering or missing while at cruising
&gt;speed in buses like my 78 2l FI kombi.
&gt;
&gt;I had already been advised that the problem might have been an
&gt;intermittent fault in the AFM, and as we are heading off on a big
&gt;desert trip in a few weeks, I shelled out for a new AFM.
&gt;
&gt;But, the problem is still there.
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions about where I should look next
&gt;
&gt;thanks heaps
&gt;
&gt;John
