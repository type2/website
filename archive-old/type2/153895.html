Subject: 2000cc rebuild!!!

Hey guys,

    With my new found treasure from the local junkyard (GD 2000cc engine), I'd
like to start planning the engine rebuild for my Bus. With this engine, I'm
planning on actually using the dual carburetors that I have. The owner of my
Bus before me spent a LOT of money on a BRAND NEW set of dual carburetors and
never got around to installing them. I'll probably use these then.

Ok, so with that said, I was doing some research with a web page that someone
sent me the link to:
http://www.tunacan_dot_net/t4/reference/case.htm

It shows me that the standard specifications for an optimal running 2000cc GD
motor is:
67hp_at_4200rpm
101ft-lb_at_3000rpm
_at_7.3:1 compression

That's quite a bit better than the AW engnie I have in there now which puts
out 65hp and 92lbs-tq.


I noticed that the Porsche motors have a much higher compression.... I saw two
variations from 7.6:1 and 8:1. The 7.6 yielded 88hp while the 8:1 yielded
100hp.

I'm sure there are othere differences as the Bus is cammed for more low-end
torque while the 914 is cammed for more mid to high-rpm power???

With all of that said... the GOAL for my engine rebuild is to have an engine
that puts out as much power as it safely and reliably can. Reliability is very
important to me more so than power. I will welcome the extra power because I
am assuming that I would get better fuel economy for when I want to take it on
a road trip or drive around town.


Anyway... does anyone have any advice for me on what kind of kits I should
get, what I should expect to pay, etc?



Thanks!!!

Todd
