Folks -

&gt;From what I've read, the SVDA distributor is the best of both worlds, vacuum
advance, and an 009-like curve. When my 009 craps out, I'll spend the money
on one of the SVDA's. I saw one online for about $130, I think.

Just my 2 cents -

&gt; Also, compare the price of a new .009 at $50.00 to a
&gt; new vac-advance at (Gee, I dunno....I'd have to *find*
&gt; one first;-)... I think you see my point! *If* you can
&gt; find the proper vac-advance distributor (new), you're
&gt; easily talking 4-5 times the price of a .009.... Is it
&gt; worth it? Not in my book...
