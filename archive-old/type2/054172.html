Without the big press, you won't be able to press the joints in or out of
the arms, period.

You can pull the arms off and exchange them for arms with new ball joints
pressed in.  You just then reinstall the new arms.  This might save you a
few bucks.

$180 seems pretty reasonable for replacing ball joints, IMO.  If you go
this route, be sure that the price includes alignment.
