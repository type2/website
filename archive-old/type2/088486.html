Subject: Re: [T2] Bay seats

[...]

Let me second George's observation below and amplify on it a bit.

My first reaction to '70 seats, even after I repadded and reupholstered
them, was not good. I was used to bucket seats.  But time went by and now I
love the old seats and I wouldn't exchange them for anything.

At first the older bus seats seem primitive. But after driving a bus for a
while (or riding in one as a passenger) you begin to appreciate how
perfectly designed they are, the spring quality of the seat  matched to bus
suspension.

Besides they just look right.

Anyone else feel this way?

Cheers,

John

&gt; I see a lot of these posts lately.  Keep in mind that seats are pretty
&gt; easily rebuilt with new upholstery and padding and *no* sewing skills are
&gt; required.  While it's not a Recaro, the ergos of the stock bus seats are
&gt; pretty good if the upholstery and padding are fresh.
&gt;
&gt; Buses have rather unique seating needs.  You sit virtually upright, and
&gt; the semi-reclining seats from conventional cars often aren't suited for a
&gt; bus.
&gt;
&gt; I'd much rather have new upholstery on the old seats than half-worn-out
&gt; uphostery on seats that are not well-suited to the bus.
