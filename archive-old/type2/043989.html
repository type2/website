Subject: [T2] read this before responding to my last message......

ok i think i came to a conclusion on my own, by tinkering around and by 
checking the archives.  here's what i know:  the van is a '78 stock fi.

symptoms:  won't hold idle.
suspect:  brake booster/servo.
what i did:  i checked the entire booster line from the engine back to 
booster, and also checked valve thingy for blockage.  everything checked 
out, no leaks.
so i disconnected the booster line at the servo and started her up.  she 
fired right up instantly, held a steady (though high) idle, the only problem 
being the lean running it produced.  i got under the van and put my finger 
over the open hose to check for vaccum, and sure enough there was and the 
idle dropped everytime i covered it up.  so i shut the van off, reattached 
the hose tightly, and tried to start her up again.  nothing.  barely an idle 
and then stall.  won't run.

so, obviously it's the brake booster/servo thingy.  can i find a used one?  
how much?  does the master cylinder come out with it?  is there a way to fix 
this problem without coughing up the crazy amounts of money that one of 
these things cost...........
oh yeah another thing, my brake pedal is stiff as hell, i mean rock solid, 
and i suspect that is also a side affect of this booster thing...

will my engine really run smooth and nice by shelling out all that $$$?

i want to get this van on the road so any help would be greatly 
appreciated...

still awaiting the bentley manual in lancaster pa......

mark.
