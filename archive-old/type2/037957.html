Subject: Re: Link Pins

Dear Ken,

[...]

Someone wrote, enclosing the below,
apparently from the Vintage Bus mailing list, asking if I'd written a
procedure for this.  Could you please post it for me?


&lt;&lt;
 BTW:  All these little washers about the size of a 50 cent piece came off of
 the linkpins.  I've cleaned them all up and wd40'd them to prevent rust
 until I can get them reassembled.  I know now that these are for alignment
 purposes and I'm wondering if I shouldn't have made a note of how many went
 where?  Is there a default value that I can start with and hope that it will
 be right or will I have to hit up a professional alignment shop?
  &gt;&gt;

Dear Someone,

I don't think I did; not for buses anyway.  The procedure is the same but the
specs are slightly different.

Are all of your parts new?  (Hahahahha... sorry :-)  Okay, are all of your
parts within spec?  Is there any wear on the ends of the trailing arms (ie,
around the hole where the link-pin goes), on the oil seal covers or on the
shims themselves?

Of course there is.  After all, the thing is old enough to vote.  (Indeed,
old enough to qualify for the Office of the President.)

The reason I mention this is because that seemingly minor accumulation of
wear -- even on the shims themselves -- makes the instructions in the manual
little more than a guess.  The manual assumes all of the components are
within spec.  In real terms, that usually means going over to the parts-guy
and hitting him up for a new stack of shims and four new oil seal covers.
Now the stack-up of shims spec'd in the manual will work.

I ran into this same problem when rebuilding Grendel's front axle.  I
salvaged shims and parts from three other axles to get enough parts to
rebuild one.  But I couldn't get any new shims or oil seal covers (ie, those
dished steel washers with the notch on one edge).

So I let the bus tell me how to do it.

With the axle horizontal and the trailing arms trammeled &amp; checked (ie, both
sides were equal), the camber is supposed to be about half a degree.  (You'd
better check me on all of this.  My bus manual wandered away years ago and I
rebuilt Grendel's front axle about four years ago; I'm whipping most of this
out of my ass. :-)

The trailing arms are slightly offset.  The spindle is supported by two link
pins.  Each link pin is provided with eight shims ( ... I think.  Early buses
had more than later buses.  My '57 had 10 (?), Grendel had eight .. or I'm
thinking of a bug ... Check it.  I don't have a manaul and don't want to take
the thing apart just to count the shims.)

The object is to achieve a camber angle of half a degree by putting more or
fewer shims between the inner face of the spindle and the bore in the
trailing arm.  The extra shims are put on the outer face, under the head of
the link pin where they have no effect on the dimension because the link
pin's length is variable.  (That's the adjustment you make ever other oil
change, taking the slack out of the link pins as the shims wear.)

The rule is to never use less than two shims.  The idea here is to distribute
the wear in the stack-up of shims.  If you used just one, it will lock to one
face or the other and a groove would quickly develop in the opposite face.

Even if the parts are worn, the table of offsets &amp; shims shown in the manual
should be your starting point.  Then put the drum onto the axle and check the
actual camber angle using the plywood protractor I described in an article
here some months ago.

Once you understand the geometry involved in setting the camber angle, all
you have to do is go through the process two or three times until the
protractor sez you are within spec.  On Grendel, I needed three tries to get
the passenger-side correct but hit the proper angle on the second try on the
driver's side.

When it comes to wheel and suspension alignment on antique Volkswagens I
really think you should do the work yourself.  Five or six times a year
someone with a king-pin front suspension asks me to look at their vehicle
AFTER they've paid some shop an enormous amount to screw it up.  And I mean
some serious problems, such as more than an inch of toe-out and nearly 10
degrees of positive camber.

Fortunately, all you need to keep your bus in spec is a couple of sticks to
measure the toe angle and a protractor &amp; a plumb-bob to check the camber.
You can buy this stuff but as I explained in an earlier article, it is easy
to make a camber protractor that is ten times more accurate than you need.
I've already described the procedure for aligning the rear wheels (see the
articles about the IRS conversion).
