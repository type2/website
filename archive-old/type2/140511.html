Subject: RE: [T2] Red Light (ALT)

&gt;That means you've got 12V on one side of the light powered by the
battery and several volts less than that on the &gt;&quot;ground&quot; side of the
bulb coming from D+ (blue wire) on the alternator. If you check D+ at
the VR you'll probably see &gt;1-2V or less.

OK, just tested it -- it said .44V! 

&gt;This means that the output from the alternator that the voltage
regulator sees is low. Possibilities include:

&gt;- bad regulator not reading B+ and powering DF correctly

Any way to check this besides buying a new one?

&gt;- battery has become disconnected from alternator
&gt;- bad battery or alternator ground

Things look good there

&gt;- alternator brushes or slip-rings not making good contact 
&gt;- alternator had electrical failure (diodes/rotor/stator)

Ugh..
