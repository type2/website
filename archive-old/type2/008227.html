Hey Y'all,
  I have some questions, all relate to my 73 Bus.(auto) 

   The engine did not do so well on the compression test. I got 100lbs
on all but #3. I added oil but it was the same, about 65lbs. So I need
to replace the valves at least on #3. I don't know what size the
valves are. I was told that the engine was a 2.0L but the case still
has the '73 numbers on the case and fan, matching. (CD? I think) The
heads on the other hand do not have the ports for the air injection
and do have a threaded hole for sensor (temp?). How do I find out what
the head size is and what size valves I need? I don't want to do a
complete rebuild at this time, just the valves on this side. Are there
head #'s that I could go by? 
  Once the head is off I want to mesure the cylinders to determine the
accual size of the motor. What are the different sizes for 1.7L,1.8L,
and 2.0L?
  I rebuilt the carbs and am trying to get them set. As I understand
it the left carb controles the idle, right? If this is true, what is
the needle valve/screw for on the bottom of the right and left carbs?
Any tips on getting this thing to idle( after I replace the burned
valve)? 
  One more, I want to put the beam from the junk 73 I have under my
'70. I want the disk brakes. I know I will have to get a new intake
and run all the hose and all that stuff, I have a complete parts bus.
What I wanted to know is, does anyone make a wheel adapter to go from
the small VW bus bolt pattern to the big 5 on the early Bus? I will
need to put the original wheels back on front or it will look funny. I
was told that the pattern of the later Bus is the same as Fords, 5 on
4 1/2, is this right?
  Thank You for any help you can give.
