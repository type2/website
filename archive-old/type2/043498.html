Subject: Starter Problems

Well, got the engine back in today, started it up and the valves were
knocking like crazy. I was hoping it was just the hyd. lifters taking awhile
to pump up. I started the Bus 2 or 3 times and let it run. On the 4th
attempt it didn't want to turn over. I pulled the starter out, hooked the
battery to it directly and the (don't know the correct terms) gear will fly
out, but the starter won't spin. Does this mean my starter's toast?
Please advise.
