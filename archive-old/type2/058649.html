Subject: How fast results!

Okay!
Simplified, informal results of the Speedfreak Survey, AKA the Tortoise
Tally...

Number of responses: 30

Upright engine: 8
1.7, 1.8, 2.0-liter-and-up: 22

Average speed (on the flats): 64 mph
High speed (downhill, wind aided in neutral): 90
High speed (downhill, in gear, white knuckles/fingernails curled into
steering wheel): 88
High speed (day to day): 75

Low average speed: 60

Margin of error: GREAT, probably.

Disclaimer: George -- Good point. Results are suspect. Speedos do read
differently (in George's case, a 75 mph reading on the speedo proved to be
62 mph). His method of checking calibration using a GPS unit sounds neat.
Someone else mentioned employing fuzz radar. Another good idea, if you're
chill with the law :-)
&gt;From the responses, those who drive slower keep their engines longer.
List-locals like Joel Walker, Sean Bartnik -- guys who know what kinda
speeds to keep -- advise slow = happy bus.
Thanks for responding!
(And know that being passed constantly is okay)
