GREETING AND SALUTATIONS. 

I WANT TO PUT A NICE REBUILT MOTOR WITH LOW MILES ON IT IN MY 72 WESTY FOR A
CROSS COUNTRY TRIP. THE FLAT MOTOR IN THERE NOW IS MAKING SOME STRANGE NOISES
AND I DON'T TRUST IT. HOW HARD WILL THIS SWAP BE? WHAT ABOUT THE BRAKE
BOOSTER, WILL I LOSE IT OR CAN I TAP INTO SOMEWHERE? 

ANY HELP OR ADVISE WOULD BE WONDERFUL.

THANKS,

MARTY :) VWSRFORME_at_AOL.COM
