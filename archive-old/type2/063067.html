&gt; It seems to me that you would need something like two hoses, one for IN, one
&gt; for OUT, with flapper valves or some other flow control device to keep the air
&gt; moving in from the fresh side and out to the spent side.  Otherwise, you will
&gt; be just moving stale air into and out of the hose (unless it is very short),
&gt; except for a very small air exchange by convection along the pipe or tube.
&gt; Maybe a muffin fan on the output to keep the air circulating would make an
&gt; adequate fresh-air mask. I would be careful about putting too much pressure on
&gt; your lungs (either by forcing them to suck or expel air through an excessively
&gt; restrictive opening, or especially by pumping air into them by blowing air
&gt; into a sealed mask over your face).
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe a SCUBA guru would be of help in this.

Good point.

Years ago, I worked in a boxcar repair facility as a painter. The 
standard charcoal filter type mask works fine to keep paint particles 
out of the lungs... privided the filters are clean and the mask well 
fitted (if you can smell fumes, the mask isn't 100%).

We insulated boxcars, after repairs, by putting up plywood, drilling a 
2&quot; hole at the top, and pumping it full of a 2 part liquid that expanded 
into insulating foam. These fumes were so poisonous that we had to use a 
forced air mask.

A belt was stung around the waste, with a regulator valve, plugged into 
an aircompressor line. A 1 1/2&quot; hose came from the belt to the mask, 
which looked like a gas mask. The air passed through a filter to keep 
compressor oil out of the mask.
