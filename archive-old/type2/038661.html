Subject: What brake caliper?

First, I ask a million pardons from the bus gods; I've posted this 
question before (a couple of years back) and don't remember the 
answer (if there was one - nothing in the archive).

I'm rebuilding the brakes on the Damfino ('73 Campmobile) and was 
getting ready to order the hardware kits for the front (disc) brakes, 
but there are two kits available: one for ATE calipers, one for 
Gihrling calipers. Seeing how I'm sitting here at work, I can't just 
rush out and put the bus up on the floor jack, and I wouldn't know 
what I was looking for anyway. So the question is:

What are the differences between the two (i.e. how do I distinguish 
one from the other)?

In the Bentley (which I just happen to have here at work with me) it 
mentions 2 types of brake calipers for the front disc brakes, but sez 
one is 71-72 and one is 73+, with the 73+ being described as &quot;larger&quot; 
but no hint of ATE vs. Gihrling.

Many TIA,
