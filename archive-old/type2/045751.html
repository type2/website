Subject: Re: [T2] re: diesel bus?

&lt;&lt;If it is all original Mexican parts, I wonder what engine size/horsepower he
had. If it was the old 62 horsepower diesel, he wasn't going anywhere fast. 
Might as well go with the TDI, even though it costs a little more. $5,000 for
just the parts is not bad if you consider the amount of parts needed. Labor
should be another $3.000 to $5.000!!! Might be better off (cheaper) buying a
wrecked diesel vehicle, and use the parts off it. Then you might get lucky
and get German parts instead of Mexican parts. (quality in question).
Customize the rest. &gt;&gt;

The bus in question here was gas powered using the rabbit type 4 cyl. 1800.
