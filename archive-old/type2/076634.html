Subject: Replacement push rod tubes?

Hi.

Anyone out there know where I might get a good repair push rod tube so that I don't have to pull my engine and remove the head.  I tried a black plastic one that kept ripping apart the gaskets.  I also bought a shiny metal one made by Scat; the spring is so strong it pushed the tube right through the head.  I seem to remember a blue tube that's adjustable...are these still available?
Thanx.
