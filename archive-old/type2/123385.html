Hi Rus,

You are lucky if you can buy some sunroof cables at all.As far as i know
there are no repro's made and all that is available is OEM and very
expensive. Also there are lots of buses that need these cables so there is a
high price.

I wish i could find some cables myself for a good price or any price at all.
