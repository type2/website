&gt;  At this point, the three vehicle options I have are:
&gt;  1-'71 Westfalia (1600 single port upright engine and disc brakes)Simple 
and 
&gt;  efficient.
&gt;  2-'76-79 Westfalia a la Ligato (1600 upright engine conversion)This has 
the 
&gt;  advantage of a better designed and more complete interior. (No blind spot 
&gt;  cabinet, propane stove, 12v fridge, etc.)
&gt;  3-Go crazy and take my split window Westie. Compatible front end with the 
&gt;  Latin American buses (no ball joints), great torque for those steep hills 
&gt; and 
&gt;  amazing in mud/snow. You now the bad sides: not as comfortable of a ride, 
&gt;  limited front view, drum brakes, reduction boxes. But perhaps the biggest 
&gt;  problem of a splittie is that it has a one circuit brake system (pre-67), 
&gt;  which means if you loose your pressure anywhere in the system that is it, 
no 
&gt;  brakes.

hm- personally I love the ride of a splitty over a bay.  The first time I 
drove a split I was sold!!!!   plus it has that superior turn radius and 
handles better on twisty mountain roads.   Drum brakes are fine, particulrly 
if you keep your brakes in proper working order.  (which of course should be 
done)   RGBs are also no problem,  whats the problem? 

If you are concerned about the single circuit brakes, you can retro fit a 
dual circuit system with a 68 bus MC, Veewee111 has the info for doing that.  
Personally I find that replacing old flex hoses improves the brake system 
noticably.    Of course, you would want to do a thourough pre trip 60,000 
type tune up before the trip, regardless of which bus you take.

&gt;  Allow me to answer a couple of things from Rich's e-mail:
&gt;  
&gt;  &gt; BUT we do not have enough power to make it about 4500
&gt;  &gt;meters.
&gt;  
you can and should adjust the timing when at high elevations.  I drove over 
independence pass in colorado, I am not sure of that elevation, but it was 
over a miles elevation ft above the plains,  which were 2K or 3K ft there if 
I remember right, andanyway there were no problems  with power (59 bus with 
1500 motor with low compression in #3 cylinder)    4500 meters- that is about 
12500 ft or a bit over 2 miles- well I think that is higher than independence 
pass,  maybe someone from higfh elevations can respond to this
