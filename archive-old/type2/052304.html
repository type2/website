Subject: [T2] Cylinder shims..need help

Today we started putting the engine together for China Cat, 75 Westy. This 
engine is a &quot;combo job&quot; using 1700 heads which were bored for the 1800 
barrels. Unfortunately, the machine shop took over .025 out of the flats 
(quench area) of the combustion chamber when they bored it. Now my 
compression ratio is too high. It takes a shim of  .030 (+.009 stock base 
shim) to get it down under 7.3:1, which is our target for safe use of regular 
gas under all circumstances.

Here is the question...I have an extra set of head gaskets. Will the 
cylinder-head joint seal with two head gaskets installed? No one around 
Knoxville TN has any base shims except the .009 stock ones. Alternately, but 
not as good, since I have to drive 50 miles to get them, I could stack 4 or 5 
stock base shims to get the required spacing.

Best is if two head gaskets will work. Would yo please answer direct, as I am 
on digest and am getting only one out of each 3 digests lately.

Thanks a zillion/Don Carron
maybe we can still build her today ?????
