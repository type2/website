Subject: High CO, continued

Volks,

Ok, so last night, I thought I had eliminated a leaking injector as the
source of my rich running (10% C0), because I had run the engine with
the cold start valved disconnected and gotten no gas from it, and
because it the fuel ring held pressure quite well, such that it took an
hour for the pressure in the fuel ring to drop by 10 psi.

Moreover, I thought I had identified the source of the problem in the
pressure regulator, because, according to my new fuel pressure tester,
the pressure was high (38 psi with the vac disconnected, 33 psi with it
connected).

However, this morning's regulator swap (albeit another used regulator)
has changed my mind.  In the first place, I got the same fuel pressure
readings with the 'new' regulator.  And in the second place, I now have
a fuel pressure leakdown problem, with the pressure going down in a
matter of minutes or seconds.  I can hear the sputter/hiss of the gas
going someplace, but it's not leaking out anywhere I can see it.

BTW, yesterday's tests were all run with the engine quite warm from
driving around the neighborhood, while this morning's were run with the
engine cold (running the pump with the engine not running by moving the
AFM flap) or with the engine running but still cool.  However, I'm not
convinced it is (always?) temperature related, as the bus failed
emissions with the engine well warmed up.

Is there a way I can test the injectors without having to disassemble
the fuel ring?

While waiting for your wisdom, I'm going to insert a splice into the
fuel ring to bypass the coldstart injector and see what that does.

Side note for KARL:

What do you make of a temp sensor #2 (in the AFM, #6 &amp; #27 at the ECU
plug) reading of 1986 ohms?  In your posts you give the specs at  2100 -
2700, as I recall, at 68 degrees.  I tested it this morning with the
engine still 'cold,' but I don't store the bus in an air-conditioned
space, so I figure the temperature was up a bit from that.   I do have a
couple of spares in my storage space, so I figure I'll test them when I
get a chance to retrieve them this weekend.
