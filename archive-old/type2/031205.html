Friday cry.

my 78 just gave me an expensive gift

60mph on a nice day Northbound on I-95 near the Md Del border when dull
pop and grinding noise.  get her off on the shoulder, sounds fine, start
easing her forward and it sounds like a CV disintegrated.  (I hope that is
all it is)

AAA just paid for itself, got towed (on a rollback) home, getting some
lunch, changing clothes, going to take a look at er.

need some good vibes folks!

Bob
