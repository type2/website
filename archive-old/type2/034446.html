Subject: Sliding door rubber orientation

I'm replacing the sliding door rubber on my '71 and have a question as
how the rubber  should be oriented. One of the vertical sections of the
rubber has a channel or groove that is visible when looking at the
sliding door opening from outside. Should this groove be to the front or
rear of the bus? My sliding door is on the right side. Thanks and happy
new year!!
