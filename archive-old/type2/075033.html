Subject: Re: [T2] Heating possiblities



&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Has anyone thought about an oil-to-water heat exchanger? Cool your 
oil
&gt; &gt;while heating the bus?

Why not put an oil cooler inside the bus?  No sense introducing 
another fluid to the system.  Best keep the lines large and plumb in 
an outside cooler for those times you don't want heat.  A simple valve 
would control which cooler gets the flow.

George &lt;- who prefers the original setup, but then again I don't live 
in the Arctic!
