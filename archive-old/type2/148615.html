Subject: Re: [T2] How I used rubber bands to make my bus go faster

Hi,

Bus Depot has a kit _at_ 14.95 :

http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=211798507A

&quot;Complete kit includes new pedal, spring, hinge, pin, and boot&quot;

When I bought the kit it only included the spring, hinge and pin, so I
guess they've added the pedal and the boot in the past few months to
the kit. I'm kinda bummed I didn't get the pedal and the boot...
wonder if they'd comp me? :)

or just the spring _at_ 2.95:

I had adjusted the cable previously as you described, however I
noticed that if I pulled the cable too tightly that the throttle would
not return to the fully closed position.

peace
jules

&gt; So... I was unaware that a spring exists.  I do know that when I adjust
&gt; the cable, I pull as hard as I can on the rod at the end of it before I
&gt; tighten the clamp.  Is this the same as strapping the pedal to the dash
&gt; for purposes of adjusting?
