Subject: silver socket

Hi all there,

I've just come in the middle of this discussion about the &quot;Silver Socket&quot; in 
the dash but if it's the same one I'm thinking about I was told by my local 
flaps a couple of years ago that it was a European accessory plug like what you 
would put your cigarette lighter into.
