Subject: bus weight...

OK OK, I have been quoted so much, Id like top clear it up. Obviously I
wa wrong about the weight of my van. I only had the 70 on a scale once
(at a junkyard) and they said the GVW (ie after we unloded our crap) was
2800lbs. The scale was wrong... still the basics of the bus weighing
more than the bug the type I engine was designed for is correct...
