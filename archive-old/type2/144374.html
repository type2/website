i have had to park the bus and i guess i will do my best on my bicycle from here on out when i cant use the wifes beetle... this really sucks awful that i cant get this right but have dropped more engines and installed them more than i can count on both my hands,....and fingers...

&gt; plate and a stop plate with lugs showing in the picture both of 
&gt; them...?? one is turned upside down above the spring??? and then 
&gt; the other which i have is under the spring and against the 
&gt; floor....?

From bottom up: Floor of bus, stop plate, spring, shift lever bracket, bolts.

&gt; also i have done the trick with putting it into second gear and 
&gt; sticking a screw driver against the plate while tightening....the 
&gt; lugs on the plate that holds it all together....

Loosen bolts, put it in second, then make sure the bottom of the shift lever is perpendicular to the floor, tighten.

&gt; i can find third and fourth but barely

Push stop plate towards rear of bus to help engage 3/4.

&gt; and also reverse is nowheres in the picture still there is no reverse

Move stop plate L/R to find reverse.

&gt; it does not say where to stick the screw ddriver just tp use one...

To push the stop plate L/R.

&gt; one more time can someone help me with this without thinking i have 
&gt; done this 1000 times before...?

This can be a trying experience. Been there.

&gt; Not only that the part the stop plate is 1.76 part and i cant find 
&gt; anyone with one from a good neighborhood....?????????????????????

Wha?

&gt; also why wheni have the gearshifter in fourth can i spin the gear 
&gt; shifter...almost like maybe the little key at the bottom of the 
&gt; shifter has came out of the front shift rod key slot

Bingo.

&gt; feels like its unscrewing (threaded)

No. The pin is out of the slot, maybe broken off? Two people helps here to get that pin in the slot.

Good Luck,
