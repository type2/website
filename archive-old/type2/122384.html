&gt; So what does the community think the initial problem is? Any ideas on
&gt; how to proceed?


The AFM adjustments are fine ones and they should not be needed at the stage
you are at, you should able to achieve a smooth steady idle at factory
timing specs, plus you should have 20 inhg at 1500 rpm. This makes me think
there is possibly an error in the timing measurement. 8 turns out of the
idle screw is also too much.

Check the indexing of the distributor drive gear. It sounds like the timing
is way retarded, if the distributor is out by one tooth you will not be able
to use the timing scale to time the motor.
