&gt;  &gt;one other note i just remembered.. the 091 bellhousing requires longer

&gt; Sooooooo what do I do about it?  The &quot;holes&quot; in the engine casing seem

grab some longer studs, and then grab the short ones with a pair of
locking pliers (vice grips, FUBAR tool) and back out the existing studs.
they may or may not be a PITA to get out but they will come out
