&gt; 
&gt; What is the latest thinking on the best exhaust nut composition? Brass?
&gt; Stainless Steel? Zink? Or anti-seize?

The original style nuts are self-locking copper-plated steel and are small
across the flats, 12mm instead of 13mm. They are available from CIP and lots
of other sources. They are commonly referred to as &quot;copper exhaust nuts&quot;. I
use hardened un-plated steel washers under the nuts. Anti-sieze is a good
idea if you use high-temperature copper type. Make sure it is the copper
type and check the temperature rating. The anti-sieze from Wurth is rated to
1200 degrees, there is one made by permatex and probably others as well.
