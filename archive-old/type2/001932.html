Subject: [T2] cv boots

i need to replace the boots on rear axle.
i have read dif. stories about dif. types of boots. (ie. brazilian boots =
no good)  da bus is a '74 westy.

so,

which ones are ok?
where can i get them?
how hard to replace if you live in an apt. complex with no garage area to
work, only the parking lot?&lt;&lt;&lt;

I did mine this week and I took the bus to a guy with a lift. I kept
thinking what a huge chore this would have been on my back in the driveway.
All the bolts were mucked up and had to be cleaned to get them out. Only one
boot was cracked, but went ahead and replaced them all and cleaned and
repacked all the joints. He had a parts washer and some nifty tools to make
the job easier. Still took about 4 hours. Also, what a joy it was to change
the oil on a lift.

Try to find an independent mechanic to let you use their lift. Should not
cost too much.

I got my boots from FLAPS. German, looked OK. I forget the brand. Each kit
came with new boot, bolts, washers, and cv grease. Had to buy one clamp for
each boot.

good luck
