Subject: WTB: Exhaust parts for 74/75

I'm starting to look for parts to rebuild the exhaust on my '74. It
currently has a '75 exhaust on it. The heater boxes aren't too bad off but
new ones would be wonderful. I definitely need a new muffler. I'm in
Chattanooga, TN - so if there are heater boxes to be had, they probably
need to be with a few 100 miles so I don't have to pay shipping.

-Eric
