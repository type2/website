Very true... the problem is that it's bye-bye cats, dogs, and any other
mammal that visits.  And it smells so *good* and tastes so *sweet* that
many small mammals[1] are tempted.  Ethylene glycol causes irreversable
liver damage and I have always considered it one of the real benefits of
owning an air-cooled vehicle that we don't have to deal with this
particular poison.

[1] small mammal here includes small *human* mammals as well (hint, hint)
