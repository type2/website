&gt; Late last night, I hooked my battery up backwards (in my 77 westy) for a
&gt; seconds and now my alternator light stays on when the bus is off and the
&gt; keys are out.
&gt;
&gt; Did I fry my regulator?
&gt;
&gt; Can I just replace my regulator or due I need a new alternator?

I did this once in a '78 (actually my dad did it to my '78).  Alternator was
TOAST.  Not a fun job either :-(

Moral of the story:  just because the cable is red does not mean it is + and
just because a cable is black does not mean it is ground.
