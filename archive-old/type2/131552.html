Subject: Fan Shroud Lower Flaps and Covers Installed! also GEX Cleanup
  Update

Hello Listees,
    I have placed some good pics of the flaps and covers on the link below 
for those who are interested in the flaps and covers that are at the bottom 
of their Fan Shroud. There are also updated pics of my GEX cleanup from this 
weekend, new paint seals and such.

Such= All missing pieces of the tin that the PO did not install or forgot to 
install.

I am still not finished yet but soon to Vroom. First the &quot;Fuel Injection 
Virgin&quot; will attempt to install a used semi complete system on this. I am 
not one to kiss and tell, but I will share my experience with all of you. 
Most likely with frustrating questions like:

Is it supposed to look like that?
Where does that thing go?
Why does one thing squirt and the other doesn't?
I think I hear something sucking, does that happen every time?
What kind of protection should I use when messing with it while it is turned 
on?

I could think of a many many more, but why should I have all the fun. Anyway 
here is the link and the flaps have a scale beside them in order to provide 
some dimensions.

Thanks to all that helped with the flaps and covers,

Michael Knight
