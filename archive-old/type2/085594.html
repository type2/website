Subject: Brazilian Master cylinders, Experiences? Quality?

I just obtained a Brazilian master cylinder for my 1972 7 seater.

Have any of you fine folks ever installed one of these?

How have they held up?

I am wondering if I will get the same 30 years of faithful service (or a
reasonable fraction thereof) as I have gotten from the original.  I do plan
or rebuilding the original to keep as a spare.  I am not having problems,
but my servo is really rusty and the master cylinder cannot last forever.  I
was going to pre-emptively replace it after I de-rusted the servo.  I also
installed Brazilian lighting fixtures and the quality of the Brazilian
replacements are significantly less than the originals.  I now fear the
master cylinder.  It is hard to judge machining that you cannot see.  It is
a new unit.

Thanks,

reh
