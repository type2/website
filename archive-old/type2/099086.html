&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was traveling and lost power and it was stalling out.

It is really best to start out with a compression test,  this, &quot;lost power and
stalling out&quot;, is the very symptom of a dropped valve seat. 

Make sure it is hot to test the compression,, cause a recently dropped seat can
hold tight when it is cold, and then pop loose when warmed up.

There is really no use in tuning up a pooched engine,,,

&gt; &gt; On the advice of the list, I replaced the points, the cap, the plugs
&gt; &gt; and cleaned my fuel system (replaced the filter, cleaned the lines).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And she's running like she was when I got her....except, she still
&gt; &gt; won't hold an idle.  I have to keep the accelerator down in order to
&gt; &gt; start her and she stalls as soon as I remove my foot.  Even when
&gt; &gt; cruising at highway speeds, she stalls when I take my foot off the
&gt; &gt; gas.
