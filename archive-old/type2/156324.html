Subject: Re: [T2] Milage of my Quest vs bus

&quot;odometer sensor in tranny (ouch)&quot;

Is that why mine has been stuck on 87,000 since I got the bus?  How much are they?  Cheers...KR

milage as our bus, when the V6 is much faster and powerful?
Maybe it's the way we drive them, but our vehicles seem to outlast 
others-we drive them to the bitter end.
The 2 liter 4 banger manual 78 Camper is still chugging at 246K mi, all 
original including Tranny- burns/blows a little oil, but gets about 
21-23 mph at 55 mpg.

The 3 liter V6 Auto Nissan Quest with 238K my spouse drives and likes 
(comfy to drive) gets 23-24 mpg, original tranny but used engine has 50 
k less than the car; the orginal was replaced around 160K due to a 
&quot;broken crankshaft by the flywheel&quot;.

Main difference between the two is that the bus cost very little to run 
to this milage (all original except usual seals, muffler and brakes plus 
heater boxes, shocks, clutch, front rotors, flasher relay, and a set of 
lifters around 110K, and CV's replaced recently (230K). Yes it has some 
rust issues in door post and jack takeoffs.
The quest needed this and that which always was over $200, like fuel 
pump (inside the gas tank!), an exhaust manifold, timing belt, 
catalytic, odometer sensor in tranny (ouch), fancy flasher relay (about 
$15 for bus, about $60 for Quest), balll joints, a radiator, and Struts 
which cost a lot more than shocks. Rust is nil- good for NJ.

Obviously the Quest is faster, quieter, more powerful, and warmer in 
winter and has AC.  It towed other busses to our place. Wife loves it 
and would rather keep fixing it up than buying a new one for $28K.  The 
bus you can live in, is more comfy for long range travel and 
camping...turns heads . ..but so slow......
