Subject: NEW ENGINE

hi volks,
   just had to tell somebody. the main seal discussed earlier turned out to 
be 6 inch long crack in the case behind number 3, going right thru the 
welded in part of the GEX case.(installed by p.o.) so i will receive my new 
aluminum cased 1600 single port tomorrow! i had it built by a local air 
cooled auto parts shop here in houston,tx. (too much going on in my life, 
living with my wife and parents in my childhood house while my dad looses 
his fight with cancer) the guy there had the new aluminum case and i could 
not resist being the first on my block to have one. we built it with a stock 
stroke counterweighted crank(had to clearance it a little but not 
much),lightened flywheel(i will try it and go back to stock if undesirable) 
rebuilt stock rods,new oil cooler and adapter,new oil pump (with polished 
cover and matched up holes between pump and case) stock p/c,new cam (forgot 
the spec will post later)and gears and new single port heads . i will swap 
the new alt., new fuel pump, new svda dizzy,tiger universal cdi, (dizzy and 
cdi from aircooled_dot_net)and old intake and 34pict3 from the old engine 
tomorrow. if all goes well i will be at the josh rodgers memorial camp out 
near tulsa this weekend. like i said i just had to tell somebody. any 
comments?
later
D&amp;K
p.s. i really like this list all the help and encoragement simply cant be 
beat!
