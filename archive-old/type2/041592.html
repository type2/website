Subject: For Sale: 1978 westy in Illinois

1978 westy.  3000 miles on new motor.  Excellent mechanical condition.
All camping equipment works.  Interior in great condition. Has lots of
other new parts: starter, seals, VDO gauges (oil temp and pressure) and
many others.  Have all recedes since we have owned the bus.  Needs body
work (rust).  Wife and I want to buy a condo and we MUST sell.  pics at
http://www.studetns.uiuc_dot_edu/~srohde/vw.html
e-mail for more info.  Engine needs nothing.  Have put about $4500.00 in
to bus but since we need the cash to help us with the down payment of
the condo we want we are only asking $4000.00 or best.

thanks
Sean and Michelle
