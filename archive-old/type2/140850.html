Subject: Re: [T2] Disc Brake Drag

The disc were turned, very little, they came off of 79 that had a new brake
job less than 1000 miles.

Thanks for the responses, I just never dealt with VW disc brake systems
before.  Thought maybe the generic pads I bought looked thicker than what I
saw a VW show.
