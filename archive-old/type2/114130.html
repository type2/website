Subject: Re: [T2] 1978 Shift Rod R&amp;Rquestion

&amp;*(*&amp;%$&amp;^!~!!!!!

&lt;grin&gt;

No good news at all huh? &lt;grin&gt;

I've got to do this shifter bushing as there is NO bushing in front and 
both boots are torn and the rear bushings are suspect - though I suspect 
not suspect  enough to remove the engine and tranny...

Time to get out the catalog tonight. Looks like I'll try the front bushing 
and inspect everything else a bit closer.

Dunno if I'm ready to have two disabled busses on the property. Neighbors 
are bound to talk... &lt;grin&gt;

Believe it or not this bus in need of bushings is a '78 bus with 83K miles 
on it and as far as I can tell has never had the engine or tranny out.

Problem is that the way i do things if the the engine comes out then I 
start replacing everything that is marginal and that means clutch, paint, 
rubber, etc. etc. etc. Maybe I can break my ways and just do the least I 
have to.




&gt;On a brighter note....when I did mine, they did not improve my shifting
&gt;at all....last time I had everything out(for the engine change), I took
&gt;the nose cone off to replace the hockey stick bushings....no such luck as
&gt;they were !roller bearing! bushings and were in great shape...the problem
&gt;on the 78 was the &quot;captive ball&quot; bushing that the end of the hockey stick
&gt;goes in to....it as loose in the piece of metal that holds it....and I'm
&gt;betting that I can only get one from someone like rancho or someplace.

Ciao!
