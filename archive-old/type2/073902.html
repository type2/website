Subject: gas tank issues-HELP ME PLEASE!!!!

hello fellow listees,

i recently sold my 85 vanagon, and purchased a 1976
westy. everything has gone pretty well so far, except
that i am having problems with my feul tank. first i
noticed that when the tank was over half full, gas
spilled out(the bottom) of the passenger side of the
vehicle whenever i made sharp left turns at speed. so,
i took it to my local vdub shop, and they discovered
that part of the feul filler system was rotted out. as
luck would have it, a part that is no longer
available. however they patched it with epoxy. i
figured, great the problem is solved for now, so all i
have to do is salvage this part and im set. then just
last saturday i was at the gas station and filled my
tank, i came out to discover a puddle of gasoline
underneath the drivers side of the vehicle. i popped
the engine lid and to my dismay saw gas running down
the inside wall(and coming out the bootom of the
vehicle). what the hell is going on here!!!???  if
anyone has any insights i would appreciate some leads
and or solutions to this persistent problem. thank
you.

                                reelin in the years,
                                       -matty
