Great, someone that is has done the installation recently!

I think I can tap the stock cylinder temp sensor into the head. That does not
seem like it will be a big issue. I have about half of this figured out, but
the big items are the ones that are not stock to a VW system. Maybe you can
share your experiences with the following items and how you incorporated them
into the engine or eliminated them?

Intake air sensor (if you needed this, not sure from the MS website)
Throttle position sensor
Oxygen Sensor

Thanks,
Corbett
