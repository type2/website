Jon-
the vibrator-type carburetor fuel pump could be failing.
try tapping it gently with the handle of a screwdriver
and it may start clicking. as pressure builds in the
pump, it must push pressure against resistance,
so it will click until the float bowl is full and then
fail when the resistance backs up pressure, but
work fine when the engine is running and the pump
flowing.it never hurts to check the ground, and the
fuel filter as well. filters can be mounted before or after
the pump or both. a pump not receiving supply will
click very rapidly, and have a reduced lifetime.

&gt;I have a 72 Bus and it runs great.  It has an electric fuel pump.  When you 
&gt;turn the key to the on position you can hear it clicking and I think thats 
&gt;normal.  The bus starts fine. But sometimes like right now the clicking stops 
&gt;and the engine turns but won't start.  Maybe a loose wire?  I don' t know.  
&gt;Someone help. Please.  This is the second time its done it to me.
&gt;
&gt;Thank You
