&gt;Have a 2.0L motor, w/ 1.8L heads, solids lifters, and 100 cam built

Not uncommon from those budget rebuilds.

&gt;Did a compression test and all cylinders are between 100 to 105 psi.   
&gt;Checked valve clearance and all are within spec.  Compression seems a

Do a leakdown test. I bet you'll have a lot of leakage from the valves even though the clearance is ok. Heads are a weakness on those motors while everything else seems to be properly assembled.

&gt;I am lost, and ready to  
&gt;throw in a SVDA dizzy.  But I don't think its the problem.

That wouldn't hurt. You should be running that distributor on any stock motor.
