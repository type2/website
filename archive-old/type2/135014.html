Subject: RE: [T2] Discount Tires (and Snows!) for Busses

&gt; This gets me to wondering who is the actual 
&gt;  manufacturer ofthe Korean &quot;Capitol&quot; tires I 
&gt; purchased for my Westy earlier this year. 


They could be anyone's, but my best guess would be Woo Sung, one of several
Korean companies that do a lot of private-labeling of tires for discount
chains, etc. I don't know much about Woo Sung and couldn't comment on their
quality. Unlike Hankook, who is an OEM supplier to Volkswagen (and other
European and American auto manufacturers), Woo Sung is an aftermarket tire
producer.
