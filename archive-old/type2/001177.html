Actually Biagio me (Tim) and my girlfriend (Heather) just finished doing
such a thing back in December. We set off in August not knowing where we
were headed or when we would be back. It was great. You just gave me the
motivation to finally write to the bus list......


We left on August 18 in my recently acquired 1966 split window. I had bought
the bus back at the beginning of the summer, I saw it at e-pages only hours
after I had finally decided not to sell my '72 and put the money into fixing
its engine. The 66 was perfect for me... it was love at first sight. It had
spent a year in a barn after coming from Colorado and thus had no of the
usual New England rust. All the major stuff was there, but it had no
interior behind the front seats, which was fine with me. I spent the next 3
months cleaning it up and creating a camper interior from scratch. I based
it on an early westy design I had seen, most of the people who have seen it
thought it was a real westy interior. Enough about the interior ......
Heather and I finally finished off the bus and pushed off a few days behind
when we wanted to leave.....The exterior didn't look as pretty as I wanted
it too, but that would have to wait...

On our first day we hit the road we went straight north up into Vermont,
where no hours after we left the bus decided to pop out of fourth gear every
now and again. I was bumming, but there was no turning back...... After a
few days we made it to New York and spent a nice weekend in Niagara Falls.
We then traveled slowly westward, through Cleveland and into Indiana. We
spent a few days at a place called Indiana dunes.  The beauty of the place
took us by surprise, dunes away from an ocean ?? On to Chicago where we took
in a baseball game at Wrigley Field. I'm proud to say now that I've been to
Fenway park, Yankee stadium and Wrigley field. From there we went on down to
St. Louis.

St. Louis and Busses by the Arch was our only scheduled stop on the whole
trip. Busses by the Arch was great fun. I time to sit back and relax and not
drive for a few days..... Met some great people, mostly the guys from the
Missouri Micro's....  they saw us sitting over in the _family_ section and
told us to come join them in the field in their little circle of
splitties... We had a great time there, in the 100 plus degree weather.....

Ofcourse the next day out of St Louis and all the bus people.... The
transmission looses 4 gear... I knew something big was gonna go wrong with
the bus during the trip, it is 33 years old. I was just glad I still had
1rst, 2nd, and 3rd gears.... I happened to have had a laptop and cell phone
modem, so I got some great advice from this list.. My aunt and uncle were
only one state over in Kansas, so we took a 2 day 40 mph trip to see them.
They couldn't have been nicer to us, feed us, showed us around, let us use
their KC Chiefs season tickets.... Well we found a used transmission back in
Missouri, so drove one day to get it, and another day back to Kansas all at
40 mph..... All said and done total travel distance at 40 mph max.. was
about 1000 miles.....

Needless to say after 4 days of greasy oily work.... I had the bus back
together and running.. I was damn proud of myself.. I had only ever removed
an engine once, and had never touched a transmission.... definitely not one
with all that reduction box goodies.....

So after almost 2 weeks, we were heading west once again... we belined
across Kansas and the flat part of Colorado and headed strait into the
mountains. It was like nothing either one of us had ever seen before. We
went up to Rocky Mountain National Park, and stayed there for 7 days..
Hiking... walking .... taking it all in..... and watching all the elk that
were everywhere..... I was a little concerned at first ....... I didn't know
the altitude would take that much steam out of the bus ..... :) We then
traveled some what lower in Colorado and explored other parts of the
rockies.... by this time it was October and getting cold at nights.....
Going to bed at 8 because it was to cold to do anything else..... and waking
up with the inside of the windows all frosted over..... We decided to head
to warmer ground, but not before crossing the Rockies at Rainbow Pass.....
at over 12,000 feet... It was Oct 6 and there was 2 feet of snow at the
top.... little did I know the whole way down was a dirt road....

From there we went into Utah, and stayed in Moab for about a week. Great
place, it was back in the 70's weather wise and we found a nice little
campsite on the side of the Colorado river. Did some great mountain biking
on Moabs slickrock trail.... incredible..... One night coming out of Arches
national park, the bus decided to finally give itself a name.... We had just
hiked back from watching the sun set on delicate arch and were making our
way out of the park. Heather decided to through in her Peter, Paul, and Mary
cd.... and after a few songs went by I heard a song which I had to name the
bus after..... Stewball .. http://www.charm_dot_net/~shack/game/stewball.html
....... You might be able to see why it just fit the bus perfectly and in
the current situation.... :)

From there we doubled back into the southern part of Colorado, then down
into New Mexico, through Santa Fe and Alba??... Then on into Arizona and the
Grand Canyon...... which was very cool looking .... but you  couldn't do
much more than look......

Onto Hoover damn and Las Vegas.... Lost some, then one some, then lost
some.... Then up to death valley where it rained...

Well we had made it to California... all the way across the country.... From
death valley we went on to sequoia and Yosemite national parks... Both
beautiful ... Yosemite had to have been one of our favorite stops on the
whole trip.......

We then headed for San Fran and took route 1 down the coast to LA.... stayed
outside LA with some internet buddies.... nice smog you guys got out
there... and onward to San Diego...

By that time we knew we wanted to be home for Christmas... 3 months to San
Diego.. One month to get home.....

We took a night drive to Tucson.... visited the cacti .... then head through
New Mexico again to Carlsbad caverns and into Texas.

We spent Thanksgiving in San Antonio and the headed to the shoreline.....
Across the gulf into New Orleans.... spent a few days hanging out there and
moved onward to Florida.... were we took in Grandparents and free passes to
Disney from Heather's little sister.... who was working there at the
time.....

Then it was time to go home.... we spent three long soggy days traveling
from Jacksonville back up CT ....... we arrived back home on December 18,
exactly 4 months after we had left.....

Ofcourse I left out a ton of details ... it would have taken 4 months to
tell...... It was a trip of a lifetime... and urge anyone that has the
chance to do it in a second.. I hope to again sometime and hit all the
places we missed ......... Its really amazing how different this country
really is...... even from just state to state....

Here is what the bus needed along the way......
Grand total over 14,000 miles.......

Transmission in Kansas
Fuel Pump in Colorado
Muffler in LA
Reduction Box bearing in Tucson - only one I didn't handle..
A bunch of oil all over....
Turn signal broke.. took out spring..
Wires got tangled in wiper motor ... few blown fusses
1 flat tire .. second to last day....

Some tips for the travelers.....

Buy a golden eagle card for the national parks ... $50 gets you in
everywhere free for a year... must have saved us atleast a hundred...
3 camping books .... one tells of free places to camp ... the other to are
east/west under 10 a night to camp..... we used these almost
everynight......
Stop and see as many friends family as possible....
Take the long way ....... take the long long way......
Wake up in the morning not knowing where you will be spending that night
..... drive for a few hours then decide....
Go everywhere, see everything.....

Other than that just have fun .. its kind of hard not too............

&gt;  Since it's
&gt; Friday I thought that I might ask the list if anybody has done a long trip
&gt; like this and if so, if anybody  would like to give me some of the
&gt; experiences
&gt; they had -- like what to do or not to do.  Also, if there is any other
&gt; advice or great stories that people would like to share with me the would
&gt; be great too.
