Alex Frieboes sends:

&gt; Can the fuel sending unit fix itself after using it a while?? My 1973 was
&gt; sitting for about 1 year. The fuel level was never correct after I started her
&gt; up. Lately the fuel level is correct (after 3-4 months of continual use)???
&gt; What happened?? 

Maybe that one railroad track/pothole/speed bump/armadillo you ran over
finally jostled the float enough to unstick it.
