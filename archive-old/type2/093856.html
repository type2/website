&gt; It just arrived in a plain brown envelop that had me confused until i
&gt; opened it. FANTASTIC mag. Vantastic article (spelling as meant) on the
&gt; start (creation) of the bus. Very wide ranging topics from mt shasta
&gt; climb (CAL) to Aussie busses. When i first put my subscription in I =
was
&gt; wondering about the cost. Not any more! Worth it!
&gt; Now why cant American publishers put out anything even close? Logged =
in
&gt; and submitted for a subs (in dollars even) after seeing it discussed
