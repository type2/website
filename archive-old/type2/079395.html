Subject: Re: [T2] Roadcow - sold?

Roadcow was sold?  Probably the most famous bus on the
internet!  Wow, I'm udderly suprised.    

Sorry, too far to help with junkyards etc.  Probably
not enough time to order an engine from
UsedJapaneseEnginesImportedDirectlyfromJapanAndGuaranteedToHaveOnly30,000MilesAndDrivenByAGranny_dot_com.
 

That Roadcow had a 3 series Corolla Engine, right? 
Those are getting far and few between.  4A's out of
FWD Corolla's, Prizms, Novas etc. are a dime a dozen,
but I'm not sure if the adapter is the same.  Of
course, then he would have to replumb hoses and
exhaust, accelerator cable, fab an engine bracket. 
Not exactly a roadside job.  

Vaya con Dios!
