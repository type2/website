Subject: Baja trip?

Greetings happy campers---
    I'm cramming way too much stuff in my bus and leaving May 2nd for my 
semi-annual Baja adventure.  We usually do a one-week spring and fall trip.  
I would like to correspond off-list with anyone who might be interested in a 
late October Baja bus expedition to a &quot;secret spot&quot; on the Sea of Cortez.  
This would be a little different than the Bob Hoover trip a few years back.  
The idea here is to get down to the spot as fast as possible (about 15 hours 
below border), set up camp and do as little as possible.  The kicker is that 
this trip involves about 100 miles of off-pavement driving, the last 15 over 
very snotty stuff usually reserved for 4wd only.  The reward is a pristine 
deserted beach on a stunning bay that we will most certainly have all to 
ourselves.  Caveat:  This is absolutely primitive camping.  No services of 
any kind for 50 miles---no water, toilets, phones, food, shelter, no nuttin'. 
 Just the desert and the sea and absolute solitude. EVERYTHING must be 
brought in.  This spot is great for diving, kayaking, shelling, fishing (not 
always great, but always something), and general lazing about.  I bring my 
Zodiac knock-off inflatable to fish the little islands just off-shore.    
    If you like being in the 1% club, and ever wondered how your bus will do 
off-road, or are an old Baja nut looking for a new spot, this might be for 
you.  Obviously, only buses in top-flight mechanical condition and GOOD TIRES 
(ask me how I know) will want to attempt this.  (For a funny story on the 
subject, with some pix, check out a story I wrote years ago now posted on 
Steve's Aussie Baja website:  www.baja_dot_com/kombi/).  If anyone expresses 
interest, I will p-mail any and all details.  

Hasta, Matt Q.  Laguna Beach, CA  '77 Westfalia
