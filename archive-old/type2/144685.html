Subject: update:  project new front shocks

well it has been a long journey, and it's less than half over.  both of
the front shocks are out finally.  i removed the other one tonight in
anticipation of my replacements being available tomorrow.  The other side
came out easily...NOT

the top was the harder part this time.  although the bottom that connects
to the torsion bar didn't go easily, it went easier than the other side
that i had to remove twice.

the break line that i broke and replaced ...

... was too long and was 3/16&quot;.  I've taken it out and am awaiting on a
replacement from Karl or Don or the break line fairy.

i was able to acquire a few new tools that came in handy.  gosh i love
PB ...

is that the correct place to put the jack stand?

in summary i want to thank you all for the quick responses and for
sharing your experience.  i'm sure the new shocks will go in much
smoother than the old ones came out.  if not you'll be the first to know.
hopefully she'll have breaks and will be rolling in a couple of more
days.
