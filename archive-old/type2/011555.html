Subject: VW RIGHT SIDE MIRROR FOR BUG (OFF-TOPIC)
Date: Fri, 01 Sep 2000 11:32:22 -0700
From: Nick Pace &lt;nickpace_at_rand_dot_org&gt;

Apologies for the posting here but I'm a Bus man ('71) and type2_dot_com
member who is helping out a friend with a '67 Convertible Bug on a minor
project.  I figure that many of you also have another Bug in the garage as
well for those embarassing moments when something goes wrong with the Bus
and you need to get to work.  All we want to do is install a right side
mirror onto the upper hinge on the passenger door.  As you may know, the
blind spot on the right side for these babies sucks big time and is
extremely dangerous.

I bought the combined mirror and hinge pin post.  The guy at the FLAPS
said all we had to do was replace the pin in the existing hinge and
badabingbadaboom.  But while the door works just fine, the pin in the
hinge won't budge.  I've sprayed WD-40 on it like holy water and banged
away from underneath with a big fat punch and a big fat hammer but nothing
happens at all.  Swallowing my pride, I've gone to a couple of local body
shops and they tried the same thing with similar results.  I had assumed
that they would have some sort of fancy pin extractor for other hinge work
but they just look blank when I describe the tool I think would do the
job.

Any suggestions?  This has got to have been done by thousands of other Bug
junkies over the years and buying the mirror\pin assembly is easy (every
VW parts store sells them).  So what's wrong with me?  (in respect to
getting the pin out I mean...)

Thanks,

Nick
