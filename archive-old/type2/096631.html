Subject: Charcoal can function?

On my 71 westy, 1600 DP, the hose on the charcoal can goes from the port on
the fan shroud to the charcoal can.  Then the other hose goes out from the
charcoal can and the end of it, I recently discovered, was just tucked next to
the battery, not connected to anything. I have tried to logic through this
set-up, but that is not my strong suit. If this set-up on my bus is correct, I
have deduced that the charcoal can system works as follows: Inside the fan
shroud The fan creates a vaccumm that sucks air from the charcoal canister.
Air would be pulled into the charcaol can from the engine compartment, thus
cleaning out any gas fumes from the engine compartment. Is this the basic
function of the charcoal can, to remove gas fumes from the engine compartment?
OR should the other end of the hose going to the charcoal can be connected to
something, and if so, WHAT?

Peace, John Baker
