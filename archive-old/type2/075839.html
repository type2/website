Hello again all listees, just moved back from Victoria, BC Canada (on =
the wet west coast) for those who don't know shangri-la to icy Calgary, =
Alberta (hi Courtney).  I'm badly in need of a block heater for my '76 =
bus.  I've looked high &amp; low on every website I know (cip1_dot_com, bus =
depot, etc) and nobody has them.  Not very surprising as how many people =
drive their busses in the winter?  That is, true winter, Canuk style.

I've seen magnetic ones at FLAPS which are around 3&quot; wide and 5&quot; long =
which could mount on the bottom of the engine but I don't know how much =
heat would actually transmit through to the oil.

Anyone have any suggestions or a block heater around? =20

PS-Courtney, I'll expand on the &quot;teachers drive busses&quot;, I work in =
education too &amp; you're right.  If they're not driving one, they're =
wanting one. ;)
