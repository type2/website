a few weeks ago i bought a 72 westy the paint and the inside are in very
good condition but it dosent run, po thinks its a bad fuel line. the
engine compartment is filthy, the po was running it with out it being
seeled, almost all of the vacume lines have holes in them. im planing on
rust proofing EVERYTHING. the bottom engine tin's have holes in them.
does anyone know where i can find decent new ones? sorry about the
ramblings.
