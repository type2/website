Subject: fuel filter location for carbureted engines

I ran a filter before the pump for years. It never starved for fuel. Having 
the tank above the engine in a Bus has always kept the fuel flowing well. 
It did overheat more that way though because it was usually touching the 
intake manifold and the intake does get hot if your heat riser is working 
as planned.

But, it did rub on either the intake manifold or the fan housing and I was 
worried that it would rub a spot on the plastic body and rub or melt through.

So, what I did was move to a non-vw fuel filter that has the intake on the 
bottom and the output on the top, both facing to the side. It has about 3 
times the filtering area, costs $3 or so and the fuel line routing is much 
straighter and kink-free. Right out of the pump, into the filter, out of 
the filter and into the carb. I don't know the brand, I just went to the 
FLAPS and looked for one with the right orientation.

Be careful with FI hose in that tight space. The thicker walls mean that 
the inside will pinch shut around a bend faster than regular hose. That is 
why FI systems usually use short pieces connected to metal lines.

Clamp, clamp baby!

&gt;For years the fuel filter on my 71 westy had been located after the pump.  A
&gt;couple of years ago I tried relocating it before the pump.  No good in my
&gt;case - the bus ran just awful, as if starved for fuel.  I put the filter
&gt;back where it had been on the discharge side of the pump and all is well
&gt;again.  I am now very carefull to keep tabs on the condition of filter and
&gt;fuel lines, and I am using high pressure fuel injection line in lieu of the
&gt;usual braided stuff.
