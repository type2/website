You can pull  the pushrods without pulling the engine. S0 - therefore,
I'd suggest pulling the tubes (I bought new ones - soooo nice! ) and used
viton pushrod tube seals from the bus depot.  If you want, I'll send you
my seals that came with my gasket set  (did not use them, since I bought
the Viton ones)
The only price is shipping (a lead on driver's side lower engine tin for
49state Vanagon appreciated though)

---My 1980 air-cooled vanagon has excessive (1 quart in 500 miles) oil 
---leak.  I have removed the cooling tin from the bottom of the motor and

---after wiping down the drips and running in place for 30 minutes, it 
---appears that the oil is leaking from the push rod tubes ---SNIP---
