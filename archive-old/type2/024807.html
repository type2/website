Listees,

There is a 1977 bus for sale in Bartlesville, OK.  It is very clean, formerly
a California bus.  It has 105K miles on it and the owner says it runs great.
The bus is white over green.  Brown interior and has the middle seat.  This
bus is also a sun roof bus (metal sliding panel).  My lady friend called and
the owner said he was asking $3500.  I talked to this fellow last summer about
the bus as it caught my eye because it was so clean. 

Problems:  not many that I can see (didn't look in the engine compartment).
The left rear side maker light is loose, probably needs replaced.  The rear
bumper has a minor bend in it.  I think you could pull the bumper and
straighten it yourself.  Other than that, the bus looks very good.  If I
didn't have &quot;campers on the brain&quot; I would get it myself.  If anyone is
seriously interested, I will try to help if I can.  The number of the seller
is 918-336-0326.  The seller says Uncle Sam needs money.  So, he may be a
moviavted seller.

Let me know if I can help if anyone is interested.  Reach me at
rwdahlgren_at_aol_dot_com or rob.dahlgren_at_aai-us_dot_com or 918-337-0203
