Subject: Dometic fridge in 78-79

Hey listees:

Ive read all the posts I could manage.  They didnt
quite answer my question. I have a 78 westy, please
read on...

My experience with the fridge is this:
a) works great at 120VAC (supply 14.5 VDC to the
heaters)
b) Therefore it must work great at 14.5 VDC (engine
running, but car not moving).
c) Doesnt work well while moving.  My guess is that its
because the fridge is convective, which works better
with no motion. 

So when you finally get to the campground the fridge is
warmer, the battery cant keep up, and as it looses
voltage the fridge drops very quickly.

my 100Ahr battery lasted about overnight.  Two days and
it was toast.

In my view the real issue is D above.  If it would be
rock frozen cold (like the morning I left home) when I
finally parked at the campground, it would probably
last more than overnight.

In light of all that.  Has anyone considered putting
thermoelectric fridge guts into the dometic body
(either as a swap out, or an add in).  Since the
thermoelectric unit is motion immune, it should be
colder at the site, and therefore should last longer
too.

Comments please??

Thans for reading

Logan

PS has anyone installed a small fan in fridge to aid
convection of cold air?
