Subject: Re: [T2] Electric Fuel Pump, YES or NO?

&gt; carbureted cars right now... is there any reason why a mechanical fuel
&gt; pump (other than push starting) would be better than an electric fuel
&gt; pump?

In relation to otherwise stock aircooled and carbed VWs, there is no
long termp advantage to either.

The mechanical pump is entirely capable of delivering the required fuel
pressure and volume.   An electric pump can deliver the same.

In the case of an empty fuel bowl in the carb, an electric pump will fill
the bowl (depending on how it's wired.) without having to crank the engine
over.  But....


&gt; Seems to me, an electric fuel pump is totally the way to go, better
&gt; starts, no loss of fuel pressure or vapor lock or any of that other
&gt; stuff.

Vapor lock shouldnt ever be an issue with a /vw/ mechanical pump. (I
understand the reference to various american cars where the mechanical
pump is located /way/ to close to the exhaust system for comfort...)

Pressure loss should also be an none-issue.  Both pumps, when not running,
will loose system pressure (a good thing in our case).  Both pumps, when
running, will maintain system pressure.

Better starts?  Again, only on those empty-bowl starts.

Overall, the mechanical pump generally has a very nice pre-made mounting
location that requires no fabrication of parts or brackets, and no running
of additional wires and/or relays.    In fact, if you don't use the
mechanical pump you'll need to fabricate or buy a plate to block this
mounting location off...
