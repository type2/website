Subject: Re: [T2] T4 Head advice needed - new/used/rebuilt/options

I'm going to stick my neck way out here, and say that I think there is 
absolutely nothing wrong with a rebuilt head that has been done correctly. 
In fact, my first Safari high top had a factory rebuilt engine put in it and 
within 2000 km the VW head had decided that the valve seats should come 
loose and destroy the head. Luckily I heard the rattle and clang, and shut 
her down before it broke up and destroyed the piston and cylinder with it. I 
had VW replace the head, but I never trusted it. I later heard about 
rebuilders using tighter valve seat tolerances so that they didn't come 
loose as the factory heads had done. I don't know anything about AMC heads 
however, but I bet Ron wouldn't advertise his rebuilt heads as &quot;better than 
original&quot; if the valve seat tolerances hadn't been done correctly, and half 
the price. I for one would buy the rebuilt heads and save the money.

YMMV,
Courtney
