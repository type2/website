Subject: RE: Deal on Boge shocks!

&gt; Nose dive should not have been greatly improved as you say it was.  This
&gt; &gt;tends to make me think that your 5-year-old shocks were more
&gt; severely worn than you think.


&gt; Nose dive indeed would have been greatly improved, gas charged
&gt; shocks offer some suspending (springing) characteristics


You're right, of course, that a gas shock would improve nose dive over a oil
shock; the very &quot;stiffness&quot; that makes a gas shock corner better (and ride
rougher) would reduce nose-dive.  I guess it's an issue of degrees.
Comparing new OEM oil-filled shocks to new Gas-Adjusts, I'd certainly expect
nose dive to be a bit better on the KYB's, but having used both, I wouldn't
call the difference day-and-night.  When he said that nose dive was &quot;greatly
improved&quot; when changing from his OEM shocks, this makes me think that the
real culprit was that his old shocks were worn (a condition that certainly
could result in increased nose dive).  Thus, the degree of improvement may
likely have had much to do with the fact that he replaced worn old shocks
with good new ones.
