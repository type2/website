Subject: Re: [T2] Living in a Bus


I was not suggesting using someone else's address, I was suggesting renting
one from a mailing center rather than a postoffice, as some of them do not
have to say box number and it passes for an address. Nor was I suggesting
camping on private property, but on the street in a dead industrial area.
dead as in no buisiness open in the section you are in so no one for you to
be in the way of. As for the bathroom, every one has to poop, and I'd rather
they did it in the toilet at the burger joint rather than on the side of the
road, and I'm betting that the owner of the burger joint on the side of that
road feels the same way. I lived in a vehicle for more than a year and never
made any problems for anyone or got in anyones way. I rented driveways for
most of it. I ate largely from the waste of others. As long as you are
respectful then I can't see how that would be wrong. Not every one has
someone to fall back on in a bad situation. Not everyone makes a living
wage. Sometimes people need time to get their sh*t together. It took me a
few years.
      I consider the best use of the list to be helping other bus drivers.
the advise I offered was sound, and time tested.

&gt; Atta boy Rob! In furtherance, using someone else's address illegitimately,
&gt; trespassing on anothers property by camping in a quiet industrial area
w/out
&gt; permission (including advice on how to avoid detection), and using an area
&gt; business' bathroom for other than it's intended purpose (namely so that
paying
&gt; customer's have a toilet and sink available when patronizing) and
otherwise
&gt; bumming off others can all be appropriately described as 'another thing'.
Is
&gt; spreading such baloney the highest and best use of the list? Not in my
&gt; estimation.

&gt; &gt; I know there isn't much bus content here and we should kill this thread,
but
&gt; &gt; I just hate to see the promotion of:
&gt; &gt; just because I own a bus too I am going to give you something for free,

&gt; &gt; Matty,  I got kicked out of my house when I was 17, but I worked every
day
&gt; &gt; and paid my bills sharing with a roommate. I now own my own house and I
am
&gt; &gt; not rich, but I am responsible.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Touring the country as a reward to yourself is one thing, bumming off
your
&gt; &gt; friends is another.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If your job is sedentary and it's not too hot, you can shower every
other
&gt; &gt; &gt; day, usually at a friend's house.  Laundry facilities can be had as
well,
&gt; &gt; &gt; especially if you're hanging out with friends where the laundry is
free.
