Subject: RE: [T2] Child's cot

My canvas &quot;seems&quot; to be in pretty good shape. Thanks for the tips about the 
ends though, we were more concerned about him rolling off than them coming 
out - now that you mention it - that seems VERY possible. Gonna look into so 
methods of locking them in...

Speaking of the quality of the material - has anyone had any luck anything 
other than the factory type stuff? I was thinking about going to an 
upholstery shop and having some pieces custom made out of stronger canvas.

&gt;I think your limits are way off.  I think the limit for the fold out
&gt;cot is around 100 pounds.  The limit for the child's cot that goes
&gt;over the front seat is around 30 pounds.  I could be a bit on the
&gt;conservative side but not by much.  One of my kids who weighs about
&gt;135 has used the fold out cot, however, the canvas is in like new
&gt;condition.  Remember that these cots weaken over time.  The original
&gt;canvas for my fold out cot failed when a kid was playing around in
&gt;it.  This canvas had spent most of its life in New Mexico.
&gt;
&gt;With the child's cot over the drivers seat, age is more important
&gt;than weight.  The attachments to the pillars are not that secure.  As
&gt;soon as the child awakes, he or she should be removed from the cot.
&gt;If the child starts to move around, one of the poles will slip out
&gt;and &quot;down will come baby, cradle and all.&quot;  I speak from experience
&gt;here.  Also, don't store any hard or sharp objects on the seats or
&gt;floor when the baby is in the cot.
