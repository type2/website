Subject: Re: [T2] cv boots

On this topic, I had two thoughts recently..

One was, how easy it would be dropping the shafts when the engine was 
out. I was squatting inside my empty engine compartment at the time, 
admiring the view.

The other thought was (well observation, really) was my trick for 
locking the wheels when undoing/retorquing the bolts. I had used the 
tighten two bolts, clamber out from underneath, release brake, rotate 
wheel, reapply brake and repeat etc etc method.

Then my knees got sore.

Next time I removed the road wheels, and used a 2 foot long piece of 
timber wedged in the wheel studs to provide leverage either for 
loosening  or tightening or rotating the shaft so I could access the 
next bolt. Which avoided all the clambering up and down, but upset me 
aesthetically. All those splinters...

My latest solution to leave the road wheels on (but still lift the back 
end so they are free to rotate) and whilst underneath, tighten the hand 
(emergency) brake adjusters a little. The critical point is where the 
added leverage from gripping the outer edge of the tyre is just enough 
to let me turn the wheel round to access the next bolt. I find this is 
also the point where I can grip the tyre firmly enough to counter the 
torque I am applying to the bolt when loosening or tightening. This only 
works with the star bolts though as clumsy little me needs two hands to 
turn the hex heads (one to turn and one to hold the tool straight).

Question time; I have found some boots break after 6 months, and others 
cost 10% more but are still going strong 3 years later. What is the 
cause of this variation. Is it manufacture, or did I do something stupid 
when fitting them?
