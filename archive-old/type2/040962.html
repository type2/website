&gt; I am looking for suggestions for ways to effectively seal around the spark
&gt; plug wires where they go through the cooling tin.  I have been very
&gt; dissatisfied with the flimsy seals that come with Bosch wire sets.  These
&gt; seals harden and shrink in a very short period of time, rendering them
&gt; ineffective.  Years back I had a Beetle that came with very thick rubber
&gt; hemispherical seals that worked fit the hole in the tin like a grommet.
&gt; These things held up for indefinitely, and never hardened. Does anyone know
&gt; of a source of a good fitting seal for these holes?
