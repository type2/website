At the same time, please remember that &quot;chocolate mousse&quot; is a normal
occupant of VW filler caps if the vehicle is only used for short trips.
Don't be too concerned over it!

My girlfriend had an early Subaru with wet sleeves that had an incurable
seal problem that let coolent into the oil.  We decided to run it until it
died.  The car ran with oil that looked like chocolate milk for 25K miles
and still ran great when she sold it!

If the oil doesn't return to normal in a week of daily driving, change it
again.  It takes only a little water to make the oil look funny.
