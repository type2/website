&gt; &gt; ... as a very small business owner myself...
&gt; 
&gt; What do you market/service?

I'm a transportation/access consulting engineer, and my firm is Access
Systems.

the cost of doing business is included in the price paid, surely you can
find it cheaper, but will the good feeling of finding a cheap price still
seem as cheap when you are sitting dead on the side of the road??

of all the companies I've done business with concerning my bus only two
have never screwed me at one point or another.  Everyone makes mistakes,
it's the cost of being human, it is what you do after you realize your
mistake that seperates the good companies from the also rans.

oh BTW, Bus Depot and BustedBus are the two companies
