Subject: Re: gas station attendants

&gt;I live in NJ, and in NJ all gas stations are Full Serve, similar to
&gt;Oregon.  You're not supposed to pump your own gas.  I think they raise
&gt;'em stupid in NJ or something, because I also hear tell of people who

Call me paranoid, but when I travel through NJ I try to make sure I have a
full tank before crossing the state line so I don't have to stop at a full
serve station.  Not that I've had bad experiences, but I go through great
pains to keep my bus away from the alien hands of mechanics and gas
attendants.  

Speaking of &quot;full service&quot;, last summer when I did stop off at a gas station
on the NJ Turnpike I noticed the attendants doing tire inspections/oil
checks and some of the customers were queued up to buy new tires and/or
other services after they bought gas.  I suppose the inspection is a good
service for maintainence-unconscious drivers (assuming people aren't getting
sold unnecessary items).  

I wasn't offered an oil check, but my windshield was cleaned nicely.  If I'm
feeling devilish next time I'll ask them to check my coolant level..
