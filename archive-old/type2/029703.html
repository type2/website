Unless you are some sort of whiz, the prospects of doing this kind of fix
correctly with the engine installed are low.  At a minimum I would pull
the engine and tin so that I could get a clear shot at the plug hole.  By
the time you are this far, some would say that you should pull the head as
well.

Pulling the head with the engine in place would require the skills of
David Copperfield.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I stripped the #3 plug on my 71 westy  and as I am short on time/space to 
&gt; pull the engine, the quick fix treatment is all she gets right now.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is, can I pull the head on my 1600 DP without removing the 
&gt; engine? If so, what hoops do I need to jump thru to make this possible?
&gt; 
&gt; OR,
&gt; 
&gt; Would I be better off just installing an insert into the head while still 
&gt; attached?  Any concerns with shavings in the engine or squaring the threads 
&gt; correctly?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your help
