Subject: Cabin Insulation

Hello folks,
I will hopefully be returning the innards to my 1973 Westfalia soon. I had been thinking about what kind of insulation to use under the linoleum. I have to replace the linoleum and the 1/4&quot; board under the linoleum. I don't know what do use that would have good sound-deadening and thermal properties, yet be thin enough to allow me to return all the furnature to its original place. I though about using the J.C. Whitney Nasa insulation, but I don't know if I would have problems with it soaking up moisture... Any thoughts or suggestions welcome. Thanks once again, list.
                                                                                -Paul Deatherage
