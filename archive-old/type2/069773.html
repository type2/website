Subject: V-Dubbin In a Small Town

Today was quite a nice v-dubbing day in small town Indianola, Iowa. As a
part of their National Balloon Classic held each summer (this past week)
there was a car show on the square downtown. I was planning on entering
my 74 Karmann Ghia in it. It would have been the first non-VW show it
would have been in - the others being the Minneapolis Bug-In and the
Cedar Rapids, Iowa Midwest Summerfest (where it got second place in
stock Ghia category - sure there were only 5). But an ad I noticed in
the local paper prevented me from entering:

Local Public Auction Notice - Saturday Aug 3... 11:00 A.M.
Among the listings of household furniture, televisions and antiques,
under the &quot;Garden Tools&quot; heading was
&quot;'66 Volkswagen engine &amp; parts&quot;

Wow! Right here in Indianola, Iowa.. I decided to check out the auction
instead of the car show as I am looking for an engine for my 65 21
Window Deluxe.

I showed up half an hour early and way in the backyard surrounded by
engine tin and the shrouding pieces was a 12 volt H series 1500 single
port Beetle engine - complete with heater boxes, generator, starter,
flywheel, coil, distributor.. everything but an oil cooler. After
enquiring I found it had been rebuilt pretty complete including both top
and bottom ends. The man had sort of lost interest as he was putting it
back together.. 5 or so years ago. I had to stick around the auction and
see what I could get it for.

Unfortunately it was one of the last things the auctioneer got to - at
5:00 P.M. It was a long wait but worth it as I got it for $100 in a
frantic bid war against one other person. I loaded it in the Vanagon and
thats where it sits now. I'm very excited.. As I'm in the process of
restoring the Microbus rather slowly I may take apart the engine and
check it out as a Winter project - no garage here for me :(.

Oh and about the car show. I left the auction twice to eat and see the
car show. What do you know- mixed in with the Detroit iron, muscle-cars,
and low-rider trucks were three VWs. A 1959 Sunroof Bug (nice) resto, a
custom Cal-look late bug and a 1967 13 Window Deluxe Microbus! Amazing -
the nicest VWs I've seen in town here since I got here over a year ago.
All in all a nice summer day - midwestern style.
