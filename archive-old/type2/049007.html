Subject: [T2] Adding  a BN4 heater? best spot??

Hello all,

I want to install a BN4 heater to my 71 Non Pop Top Camper (I am freezing my 
ass off up here in NY!) - It didn't origionally have one, so where is the 
best place to install it with out chopping up the camper?  Any suggestions 
from the listees that have on pre-installed?  Thanks!
