Subject: Re: [T2] Going back to dual Solex's

&gt;I love my dual solexs, only thing i wish i could change is the linkage, id
&gt;rather have the hex bar linkage rather than the -whatcha ma callit- ball 
&gt;and
&gt;joint linkage. but the ball and joint work great, just a bit tougher to
&gt;adjust... but still not hard
Heh. I just wrote about that damn linkage. Mine has failed a few times. 
There is a better linkage out there. I think HotVw's has an article about 
the new linkage.

Jason.
Oh, and Peace to you too.
