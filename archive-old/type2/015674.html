Hello all!!

Well, I'm stumped!! I've had the heater boxes off my bus 3 different times
yet I can't seem to get the right hand one seated correctly. When you look
up into the heads, on the right side, you can see the copper gaskets, but
on the left, you can't. 

On the right head, it looks like the the area were the exhaust bolts in is
very large, while on the left there isn't that much visable. So this leads
to the question, do I have two different type heads?
