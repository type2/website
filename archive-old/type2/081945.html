Subject: Re: [T2] GL4 found cheap

I asked the list about this a while ago but got no answer. I can get this
stuff all day long right around the corner but I'm wondering if the SAE 90
is a problem. Isn't the spec for 80W90? Will straight 90 cause a problem?

List,
Found at non-corporate FLAPS:

&quot;MULTI-GUARD 90 Gear Oil GL-4
Specification: AGMA 251.02 EP SAE 90
Extreme gear lubricant well suited for a wide variety of industrial &amp; mobile
equipment enclosed gear systems, chain drives, sprockets, plain &amp;
anti-friction bearings, slide guides &amp; flexible couplings. Meets MIL-L-2105
specification.&quot;

It was in generic-looking gallon jugs on the shelf at $5.00, so i bought a
gallon.
We have a lot of sawmills around here and this parts house keeps alot of
them
and the local heavy equipment industry supplied with parts.

So, am i good to go?

TIA,


Clark Gordon
Morehead, ky.
