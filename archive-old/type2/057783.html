Subject: re: Help me split the case!!!

Hey Tom,

I remember trying to split the case on my '74 and I swore up and down that
I had found and removed all the bolts, BUT, much to my chagrin, after I had
ruined the case near the breather, I found another small one at the front
(FIF) behind the flywheel.  Clean it all up and roll that sucker over and
over until you are sure you them all.  Then do it once more.  It supposedly
should come apart with a few raps of a rubber hammer or a steel hammer on a
piece of wood.  I guess this depends on what kind of case sealant was used.
If it was glue than I guess it might be harder.

Hope this helps,

Ron
