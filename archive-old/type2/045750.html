Subject: [T2] smoke from heat exchanger at the flange and muffler

ok let's start with my bus it's a 73 with type 4 engine
just recently I have noticed smoke coming out from under the
passenger side HE. so I got down there last night and saw
smoke coming from the rear part of the Heat Exchanger at the flange
where it hooks to the Muffler.
I have checked the plugs, valves and valve covers, I am not getting
any other oil leaks, and no oil dripping onto the garage floor. One
more thing to note, on start up a little oil comes out of the exhaust.
do I have bad rings?  any help would be great
Tonight I plan to run a compression test...
