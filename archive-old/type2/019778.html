Gas smell...  leaky vent hoses. (I'm assuming that the bus is a '77 from the
poster's address.) Top of tank behind firewall and possibly at the pipe to the
charcoal cannister located between the inside of the exterior sheet metal and
the spare tire well.

Oil...  No visible leaks?  The only other place that it can be going is out
the tailpipe. Compression test might not catch the problem.  Leak down test
might.  If it's using a significant quantity of oil, have someone follow you
and look for the tell-tale puff on shifting and the unmistakable cloud on down
hill over run.

Mine?  It's a '77 that leaks from the rear crank seal.  No doubt where it's
going...  It's all over the back of the bus!  Uses/loses about a quart per
tank of fuel. (Helps keep the dust down on the dirt roads we drive on!)
