Subject: Re: [T2] ignition switch, ELECTRIC part

been all over the library and every thing about the ignition switch
goes into all sorts of detail about removing the lock part.  but my 78
bus mechanical part works fine. but the electric part is intermitently
acting up.  is it possible to replace just the electric part without
tearing the whole thing apart...

Bentley is extremely silent on this part too.

thanks
Bob
