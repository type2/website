Subject: brake job

&gt;&gt;Question two: Do I really need any special tools to &gt;&gt;do the rear drum brakes,

&gt;Not sure if your drums are exactly like mine, I have &gt;a 71. But the hardest hurdle is getting the axle &gt;nuts off

Not required on 73-79(?). The rear drums are compostite and come off with the two (10mm?) bolts which will be obvious when you get the wheel off.

Original post said wheel bearing job too, so then you need to get the hub off (46mm castellated nut) start putting on the liquid wrench now.

Billy
