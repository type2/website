Subject: Temp Guages?

How many different places could a temp gauge be?  The new acquisition (1600
DP) has a wired gauge, at least wired to the fuse box, and I am looking for
the sender.  I know it is not a dip stick sender.
How about, is there such a thing as a pressure sender/gauge??  The pressure
sender I have has an attachment that has two screw heads.  I found a hot
wire and connected it, does make the gauge go 300*+ when I start it, but
then doesn't seem to work, goes to zero again.
I have an O'Berg oil filter..there is some sender on the top that is
disconnected, could this be a temp gauge sender?
Ahhhhh, maybe a head temp gauge???  How would one determine this with the
engine in place?
Thanks in advance everyone.
