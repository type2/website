.&gt; My theory is that because I loosened the adjusting screws when I put the
&gt; rockers back on, that when I went to adjust cylinder 1, the contralateral
&gt; valves on cylinder 3 were not really being activated, so the cam wasn't
&gt; under any pressure from the far side, resulting in a false setting of the
&gt; valves on 1, etc. Does that make sense?

No. ( Replace the cam and cam bearings:)
