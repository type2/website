Subject: cleaning tip of the day

Hello all,
OK, I found this works nicely:  Go to FLAPS.  Buy bottle of Gojo Orange
Pumice hand cleaner.  The bottle with the little brush on the side.
Work on your bus.  Clean your hands with the Gojo,  Watch as all the
grease and grime is magically washed away and the baby oil leaves your
hands feeling nice and soft.  Then rub your fingernails on that brush,
it cleans all the crud out from under them.  Wow!  

I was using regular Gojo before, but it leaves your hands smelling like
turpentine.  This stuff smells like oranges, uses pumice and some citrus
ingredient to clean your hands, and even cleans under your fingernails.

I like it!

Sean
