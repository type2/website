Subject: Re: [T2] heater help

    Melissa, I had the same problem when I replaced my two heater cables.  One was
easy, one was hard.  Well, after installing, I realized I should have heeded the
message.  It
needs replacing. It was quite awhile since they were bought and I had misplaced
the invoice.  A twenty dollar lesson.
You may be needing to replace the tight one.

ps, I haven't forgotten the levers, I've been unable to make it to the yard.
