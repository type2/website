&gt; After making this Hoover modification (which is very difficult with the

&gt; to go is to weld a piece of steel line into the tin, then clamp hose on 
&gt; either side. That way, nothing is moving and abrading.

What I did was to take one of the electrical devices that loose wire
passes through j-boxes and the like. it has a rubber grommet that when
the nut on one end is tightened it holds the rubber hose in place.
local home improvement.
