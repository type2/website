&gt;  hey list - i'm looking for some hints to get my '78 running a little better
&gt; in the morning...the FI has been replaced w/a weber progressive that loves 
&gt; these texas summers but bogs terribly when the temp dips below 50F. i've
been 
&gt; played w/the choke to rich the mix during cold starts, but it's still pretty
&gt; tough to get going. anyone have similiar problems/potential solutions?

Hi Walter and the list,

I don't know exactly how exacltly how Walter has done his conversion from FI
to carbs, but a common failing when fitting a non-standard carb is to use a
nice little paper filter sitting on top the carb. 

What people dont do is connect the crank case breather to the air filter (even
on concours vehicles) and the make no provision for preheated air. All the
carb vehicles I have had have had provision for heated air being taken into
the carb - on my '73 T2 this was even thermostaticaly controled to promote
warm up. A stock 1600 T2 takes this from the air blown over the #2 cylinder
(no need for fancy plumbing from the other end of the heat exchanger).

So if Walter has no preheated air then the cold air will be able to carry less
fuel to the carbs slowing down the warmup, the cold air/fuel mixture will also
tend to freeze 
on the unheated input manifold further promoting bad cold running. [do not be
lulled into thinking that because its above 0C/32F that you will not get
freezing the sudden expansion of the air/fuel mixture after passing through
the carb will significantly lower its temperature]

Folk who fit after market exhaust systems that don't have connections for the
input manifld preheater pipes (or the connections are internaly wrong) (or a
blocked preheat tube) will not get a flow of exhaust through the tube and will
be liable to suffer icing too.

FI of course controls the mixture with cold start valves and injects the fuel
much closer to the intake valves.

If there is no possibility of fixing up preheated air the heat the input
manifold with a manifold heater connected to the choke/cut-off valve power
supply

Good luck
Bob

PS Some of the above is I realise Type 1 engine specific but the princibles
apply to Type 4 engines too.
