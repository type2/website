Subject: Re: [T2] where to put spare on 77 westy ?

In my tests several years ago, it was apparent to me
that the airflow actually improved with the spare tire
up front. Any notes on the subject are long gone, sad
to say, but I really did make comparisons. I also
tried mounting underneath with a chain capstan from a
pickup truck, but was unable to really get it where I
wanted it due to obstructions. I'd like to mount it
underneath the nose. It's possible but I never got too
into it  with all the plumbing I have up there now.

&gt;  
&gt; how bad is that for fuel milage ?
&gt;  
&gt; it really takes up too much space inside but what
&gt; else do you do ?
