Subject: purchasing shortblocks

--part1_61.1c61884c.29c0b608_boundary

hey everyone,
 ok so I have finally after a lot of thought, decided to purchase a 
shortblock and a set of mahle forged pistons and jugs.  I have the dual port 
heads and all other pieces to put together.  Iv'e been looking into companies 
to purchase from,  and for the price mofoco looks good.  They have a heavier 
duty 1600 stock shortblock for $450 and my pistons and jugs for $169 pretty 
good deal for me. I figure I live here in Vermont and shipping for all can't 
cost more than $100. Thats $700 for the whole package. Does anyone have any 
info on this company's rep. I mean, am I gonna get crap?
Does anyone know anyone else who builds shortblocks for a comparable price 
without skimping on quality?  Dependability is key.  Thank You
