Here in the Netherlands, you don't have to pay roadtax if your car is 25+
years old. This makes it attractive to give your car an older day of birth,
1983 Mexico-Beetles can be tax-free that way. (you can also do it legal:
change the pan...)
 Another fact is, that original dutch cars are worth more money then
imported ones, or at least, people think that.
A third thing why to change a car's VIN is that to import cars, especially
from outside the European Union costs a lot of money (taxes...).

It's kinda hard to get a buggy legal on the dutch roads nowadays, but the
pan is rusty, so changing VINs is the easiest way.
A VIN of a (rare) 'tax-free' RangeRover is worth about 7000 guilders
(US$3500)... Heavy cars cost a lot of tax...

Most of people change VIN for this reason, though it IS VERY illegal.
(ssssst, don't tell it further....)

It's also done a lot with newer cars:  for example: you buy a crashed car,
get a stolen car of the same type, and get the VIN from the crashed car
into the stolen one. Unfortunately, this IS a business.
