Subject: Child's cot for sale

Greetings all.

I have a child's cot for a '68-'71 Bus.  It is in good condition.  The poles
are in good shape and the canvas has no rips or tears.

I am to get $30.00 plus shipping for it.  I am located in east Tennessee.  I
have it boxed up and ready to go.

Anyone interested?  If you are, please e-mail me privately.

Thanks,
Victor
