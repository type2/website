Subject: Re: oil leak from crankcase vent?

I haven't had any feedback on the problem I am having with my van. Does anyone know how the 
crankcase venting works on the vanagon engines?

Here is my dilemma...

My newer '84 GL Vanagon (water cooled) has been leeaking oil during and for a short time 
following each use. It doesn't leak once it's cooled down. It doesn't sweem to be coming from 
the pushrod or valve cover area. I thought it was the rear main seal at first because it was 
dripping from the junction of the engine and bell housing. There is, however, no oil over the 
automatic transmission's torque converter which a mechanic friend agreed would be the case if 
it were the rear main seal. Upon further inspection I have found some oil sprayed against the 
front of the engine compartment on the passenger side apparently from a hose that passes 
through it. I haven't been able to find this hose mentioned in my Bentley manual and I don't 
understand the function of the hose. Also... I have found oil in the rubber bellows that 
connects the air sensor box and the crankcase ventillation hose into the throttle body. The 
intake appears to be sucking some oil through the crankcase vent. I haven't found any 
information on the crankcase vent. I'm also having a problem where my fuel injection systen 
isn't going &quot;closed loop&quot; and so it's running real rich and my gass mileage is the pits.   

Could all these things be related? Could the hose that appears to leaking oil be some sort of 
crankcase ventilation return hose? Where does it go to/come from and what is its function? If 
the crankcase ventilation were obstructed could pressure build up while the engine is operating 
that could force oil out through this mystery tube? 

And while I'm asking...What is the meaning to life, the universe and everything?  I'm not 
asking too much am I? 

I'm scratchin my head on this one! 

Anyone have any insight into what this hose does and how it may play a role in my problems?
