Subject: RE: type2 Digest 12 Feb 2005 17:00:00 -0000 Issue 4868

&gt;From: &quot;Marcus Schaper&quot; Mike,

&gt;Fortget the adjustments if your bus is running good right now, don't touch
&gt;the carbs. I have hauled cars across the Rockies with my camper without
&gt;adjusting my carbs and I was fine. We went I-40 through Albuquerque to
&gt;Sedona.

&gt;However, take an extra fuel pump. Mine starting leaking at high altitude
&gt;though it was fine when I was down to normal level again.


Sorry Marcus,

I don't own a bus with Carbs anymore. FI Baywindow and FI Vanagon. This is 
Don that has the carbs so I will Pass it on.
