Subject: 65 camper update

yes, no job is ever done.  Today I got back to making the 65 camper happier.
  She's looking more alive from being driven, and I've even been cracking the
safaris as we've been blessed with sunny weather.  Well I   CHANGED THE GEAR
OIL.  Yum.  my favorite.   I did it after I came back from driving it, so itt
was warm and stirred up.  Black.  The magnets had shavings on them.   Yuck.
  I'll hace to do it again to make sure it's all clean, but it's a good thing
I did it.  The center section and both boxes.   I recommend this to every one
who hasn't done it in the past year or so.   Really.  The trans was fine, no
sign of any thing strange, or any wierd noises, but it is a good maintenace.
   

But I found something strange while i was under there.   I looked at the
motor, which was dirtier than I had expected, as I had washed it, and found
something strange on one of the push rod tubes on the left side.   A piece of
gasket rubber.   ?    Huh?    On closer inspection, that push rod tube was
cracked.   So it had to go, I can't drive around with that leaking.   Luckily
I had one of those replacement two part tubes.   Using that I didn't have to
pull the motor and the head.   I just popped the valve cover and unbolted the
rocker arm to take out the relevant push rod.  then I un screw the tin under
the tubes, and pulled it give acress to the tube, which I poked with a screw
driver, and removed with a pair of pliers.   I replaced it with e the two
part tube, which I screwed out to give a good pressure fit between the head
and case.   The tube has a rubber gasket at each end, and one between the two
parts.   After that was securely in place I replaced the push rod and rocker
arm and put the cover back on.  It really didn't take that long.    

After these jobs I was filthy.   Oh dear, I had thought I had washed under
these, but in spite of that rubber stuck on there, it was all gooey.    I
checked the oil, and it was fine.    So it was just oozing.   Think I'll do
another tune up and oil change soon, though, as the oil is dirtier than it
should be for the miles I put on it since I've been driving it, and when I
changed the motor oil before you could stand up a spoon in it.
