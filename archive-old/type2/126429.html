Subject: Bus for sale

Ok. I'm done now.

I made the effort, tried to make this bus worthy of my family, to no
avail. I've put way too much $$ and time into it with nothing to show.
I've taken too many days that should have been spent with my family
and dumped them into this bus.

Plus, with my wife having Lupus (sp?) and not working, I don't have
the funds to keep going.

What was the final straw? I was starting to take the rear brakes apart
to rebuild the cylinders when the bus rocked off both the stock jack
AND the jackstand that was under the jack point. I WAS UNDER THE BUS
WHEN THIS HAPPENED!!! I had just popped my head out of the wheel well
to reach for a pair of pliers when it fell. I managed to pull my legs
out just in time. I've never had a vehicle rock off like that. Both
wheels on the drivers side were chocked front and back (I was working
on the pass side). There was no reason for it to fall. I wasn't even
touching the bus at the moment.

So. The first person at my door with $500 can have the 73. I'll
include all new front brake pads, rear brake shoes, rear wheel
cylinder rebuild kits, whatever else I find that goes to the bus.
Also, the Pioneer CD deck and the box speakers. And the 009 that came
with it. (I timed the &quot;new&quot; vacuum dizzy to 5deg atdc and it seems
much better now.)

Most of you have followed my adventures with this bus, and probably
know as much about it as I do. Exhaust needs replacing/work. Tie rod
ends need done. Lots of body rust, chassis has surface rust (nothing
seems rotted through which is surprising). Wiring snafus all over. I
got the headlights, tail lights, marker lights, and hazards working.
Turn signals still trigger the hazards. Dash lights need new wire
(fried). Missing miscellaneous lenses and such. I put a grill on the
front, pulled out the screens with the intention of re-screening them.
2 new 205-75's on the rear. Fronts are whatever crap came on the bus.
Not LT rated. (I swapped the new ones to the front to see if there was
a handling difference. There was, but not enough to justify the
reduced turning radius due to the wider tires. I put them back in the
rear.) Needs interior. Needs windshield. Needs another valve
adjustment (drivers side got quiet all of a sudden...) Carbs in good
shape, but a piece of linkage has come loose and I can't figure out
where it goes. Doesn't affect the operation though (?!) Needs new
brake backing plate on the pass side rear (from rocking off the
jackstand and landing on the backing plate.) Needs the rear cylinders
rebuilt. Needs a cooling tin seal. Needs rear bumper and brackets. I
think that's it... I put in new drag link, tie rods, vacuum dizzy,
wires/plugs/etc.

I have a digicam so if there's anything in particular you want pics
of, let me know.

Mail me off list if you're interested. If nobody here wants it I'll
strip out the stereo and return the brake pads/shoes and put it on
eBay.

Maybe life will deal me another bus in the future when I can afford
the time/$$. I really love the bus and the community, but the
trade-off just isn't worth it at this point in my life.
