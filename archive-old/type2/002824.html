Subject: [T2] A Little Bit of FI Troubleshooting Success

I won't repeat the saga... but tonight the engine started.  But only after
replacing the fuel line from the tank to the filter (apparently the previous
owner replaced it with copper tubing that got kinked slightly to prevent
flow to the pump...etc...etc..).

Well after a gasoline shower, I was able to start the engine.....

But it only ran at high RPMs and would frequently &quot;pop&quot;... sort of like a
weak backfire... and to top it off, the engine would not idle.

Now, I suspect there are a couple of things going on here...

1.  The &quot;pop&quot; is most likely related to the timing.  Unfortunately, the
condition did not improve as I adjusted the distributor.  I am wondering if
the AVP motor I bought needs a valve adjustment (I never checked it and
assumed it was correctly set as suggested by the literature).

2.  The lack of idle is disturbing.  It idled fine before it died on the
road 5+ years ago.  Aside from burning a ton of oil (when I burned/dropped
the valve), I never thought the FI was a problem.  I am targeting a vacuum
or air problem as the cause for lack of idle.

I would have troubleshot further tonight, had I not been so flammable and
overcome by gas fumes.

If anyone has any further ideas, please send them.  I am one step closer.

Thanks - Mike
