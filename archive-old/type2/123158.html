Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Music???

Hahah.. I'm 25.  Actually.. that doesn't sound as young as it used to..
hmm. Yeah, I think it's cool to listen to that music in the Bus. Totally
makes me feel like I'm in a different time. Not that there's anything
WRONG with the time today, but I just feel like there's SOOO much
communication today, that it's tough to &quot;get away&quot;. I'm a computer
programmer, and yet, I absolutely REFUSE to have a cell phone. Everyone
says.. &quot;YOU HAVE TO GET ONE!!!&quot; but the way I see it.. the human race has
survived so far for hundreds upon thousands of years without cell phones.
Only now, in the past 8 years have people started buying cell phones. Why
now is it suddenly a requirement that everyone have one? I'd rather walk
a mile from my broken down vehicle than carry a cell phone on me all 364
other days of the year.

I could totally be into the 60s &quot;hippie&quot; lifestyle, people who are tired
of the day to day crap. I don't know if I'm into the whole convent thing,
and well.. I am a Republican too, but I think the true ideals of a
&quot;hippie&quot; are simplicity, and not getting caught up in the latest and
greatest fad.

&gt; Well, when I think of music that I would listen to in my Bus, I think
of like... 60s complain rock. I snagged a bunch of CDs from my parents
many years ago when I was still in high school and living inside. 
&gt; 
&gt; One of them, I don't know what the groups name is.. but the song
&gt; sounds like.. &quot;Sha la-la-la-la live for today!! lalala&quot;. Then
&gt; &quot;California Dreaming&quot; by the Mammas and the Pas, grace slick with
&gt; Jefferson Airplane, all of that other hippie stuff. Sounds great in a
&gt; Bus!
 
yer turninng me into an old man, I was listening to that stuff on the top
40 station on my Shaphire AM radio in my 60 23 window deluxe when it was
top of the charts,,,,,,,,
