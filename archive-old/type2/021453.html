Subject: [T2] What to expect?

&gt;I'm in the process of  removing the interior of my 71 Westy, once that
is
&gt;done, I'm going to remove the original Linoleum that's still covering
the
&gt;floor.  Hopefully, the metal won't be too bad. What can I expect to
find?

I just stripped out my '72 Westy.  I haven't posted the pics yet, but I
can tell you what I found.

It's real easy to pull the cabinets.  Just do it in the logical order.
(I plan on building brand new cabinets from scratch, so if anyone wants
to buy the old ones let know.  They're in decent shape, but may be a
couple months before I'm done using them as patterns.)  After the
cabinets and seats out, the floor should pretty much just pull out.  My
floor had  after market carpet over padding over the original linoleum
which is mounted on wood.  Very used and dirty but easy to remove.

The metal floor was so filthy I couldn't see how much rust damage there
was.  30 years of PO's spilling drinks up front and letting it run down
under the carpet.  A mass of sticky goo.  Under the rear cabinet I found
a mix of sugar and soda and gum.  Fun cleaning.  Good news is, after
cleaning the goo, what I found was mostly good metal with patshes of
surface rust. Unfortunately, there are lots of nooks and crannies for
spilled fluids to settle.  Most of the gook settled in 3 places.  1- At
the back, under the bench seat, so the tight corners against the wheel
well were hard to get to.  2- The little square indentations in the
floor.  Not sure of their purpose, but they were pretty easy to clean.
and 3-  The hard part.  The bolts that hold the bench seat to the floor
rest in little holes in the floor.  The bolts come out, but fluid and
rust has collected here.  I couldn't get to it to clean it very well.  I
POR 15'd it and hope for the best.  There is a similar spot along the
drivers side.  A plate welded to the floor with holes in it, utilized
for something not in my bus.  These spots are virtually impossible to
get to without removing the welds.

Get a wire brush that attaches to a drill gun and scrub the heck out of
the floor.  I
followed with a coat of POR 15 and plan to repaint the whole interior.

Biggest rust problem I have in the interior is (are) the seat belt
mounts.  All 4 main mounts (2 on rear wheel wells, &amp; 1 on either side of
front seats) have rusted completely through.  I can see the ground.  I
think it has something to with the way VW welded them in.  If you have
this problem, find a good welder.  I'll have to cut them out and build
new ones.

Hope this helps.  Good luck.
