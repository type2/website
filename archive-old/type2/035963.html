&gt;Hey y'all
&gt;got a good one.  Getting ready to do the brakes on the Dor and I was
&gt;wondering what the best way to get all the black gunk outta the brake
&gt;reservoir might be.  The openings are too small to stick my finger in.
&gt;I tried swishing brake fluid around but didn't loosen much at all.  Any
&gt;answers?

Put a tablespoon of BB's or no. 2 birdshot in there and shake it around.
Kinda like lo-tech bead blasting. Just be sure you get every last single
one of them back out of there before you reinstall the reservoir. Sami
Daklia gave me that idea and I just said, &quot;Why didn't I think of that???&quot;
