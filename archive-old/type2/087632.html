Subject: Re: RE: [T2] Main Harness - how difficult to replace


&gt;pretty much stocked-out 71 in your area.  Then take pictures of that
set-up.  
&gt;Having a &quot;model&quot; to go by is simply invaluable when you are contemplating a 
&gt;job this intricate and you are, basically, starting from scratch.

I'll take it one step further, if there is any way possible damn good to
have the model sitting right there beside you...
