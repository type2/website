Subject: Re: [T2] 78' Westfalia- T1 engine running hot

Maybe or maybe not.  Is the engine sealed completely
sealed?  Do you even have engine tin?  You have to
seal it up, with DIY tin or the commercially available
versions.   

Is the engine timed correctly?  Fuel mixture proper? 
There are many reasons why a 1600-1641 might run hot.

But he's right, the gearing is wrong for a stock HP
type 1 engine.  But it's not hard to bump it up to
stock type 4 hp still run cool.

&gt; Reinstall the factory 2000 cc Type IV with correct

&gt; 
&gt; You've probably got the right transmission for a
&gt; Type IV 2.0 engine which 
&gt; is too tall a gear for that 1600cc engine.
&gt; 
&gt; The other option would be to find a lower geared
&gt; transmission - whatever VW 
&gt; was installing in late bay 1600cc busses in Europe -
&gt; and install that. It 
&gt; will make the engine happier because it turns more
&gt; rpms.
&gt; 
&gt; Either way don't expect much high speed cruising
&gt; speeds, it won't be very 
&gt; happy pushing that much weight and that much wind.
&gt; 
&gt; There are plenty of cores around still but it may
&gt; take you a while to find 
&gt; one for a Type IV. Rebuild it while your bus is
&gt; running good and you can 
&gt; work much more at your leisure and in my case -
&gt; budget.
&gt; 
&gt; Regardless - most of the busses turn the best mpg,
&gt; least noise, and least 
&gt; engine heat at about (some with differ) 100 kph or
&gt; 62 mph.
&gt; 
&gt; They will go faster and make more noise, drink more
&gt; gasoline.
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever suits you.
&gt; 
&gt; I had a roommate with a 1200cc 40 HP Beetle that had
&gt; a 3.88 gearbox 
&gt; (somebody blew the OEM engine and replaced it with
&gt; an Italian spec engine. 
&gt; 1200cc was the most common engine in that area.
&gt; Vehicle taxes were based on 
&gt; engine displacement.)  Man would it fly on a
&gt; downhill slope and purr along 
&gt; at such a low rpm HOWEVER it was a dog on the hills
&gt; and ran hot anytime a 
&gt; load was put on it for any length of time.

&gt; &gt;Hello,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  I recently purchased a 78' Westfalia.  The prior
&gt; owner installed an
&gt; &gt;upright type 1, 1640cc (something like 1644cc or
&gt; 1646? I don't remember)
&gt; &gt;dual port, single carb engine.  The other day I had
&gt; it out on the
&gt; &gt;freeway for the first time and it quickly started
&gt; heating up (closing in
&gt; &gt;on 250 degrees at freeway speeds).  It seems better
&gt; if I drop it down to
&gt; &gt;around 55 mph.  Here is my question.  What kind of
&gt; type 1 motor could I
&gt; &gt;build that would adequately push this Westy along
&gt; at 70 mph?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt; &gt;Greg
