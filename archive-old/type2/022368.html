Subject: Hard shifting
Mime-Version: 1.0

Folks,
   I've been having a problem shifting in my '78 Westy. The odd part (to me 
at least) is that it shifts fine when it's cold, it gets harder and harder 
as I drive. The shifter seems a bit sloppy too, I was going to investigate 
that this weekend, could that be the root cause of the hard shifting?

Thanks,
Rob Braden
Nashville, TN.
