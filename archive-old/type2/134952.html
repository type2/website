Subject: RE: [T2] Strange distributor configuration

&gt; It is well known that the bosch parts were what came on
&gt; the older VWs and was for the longest time the best Quality
&gt; parts. Lately even Bosch has been putting out some junk.


Actually there were two OEM German tune up parts suppliers to VW - Bosch and
Beru. The German company Beru was a major supplier to Volkswagen in the
German market, and their parts were every bit as good as Bosch's. The
difference is that Beru's output remains more consistent in the present day.
Their tune up parts are still German made, whereas Bosch production has now
moved to Mexico, India, Brazil, and even China.  When I can get them, I try
to stock up on Beru caps and rotors, and supply them in place of the
non-German Bosch parts in the tune-up kits I ship. Unfortunately the Beru
equivalents are not always easy to get, as Beru doesn't have nearly as
widespread U.S. distribution as Bosch does.
