Just for a camparison - the &quot;Yakima&quot; system I ALMOST bought here in 
Mammoth would have been just under $1100!!! The &quot;Space Case&quot; cargo box 
alone was $595!!! So - if your's is nice and comes with the risers and 
load bars, it's well worth the $300 you're asking.

I ended up getting  a Thule on a pro form (professional discount for 
Professional SKi Instructors) and got the risers, load bars, &quot;Magic 
Box&quot; and two upright bike racks for $650 delivered.

SO - your's is worth it.

Good luck selling it!

To any of you out there who might be debating whether or not to get 
one... wait no longer! They are TOTALLY awesome! It took me 3 years to 
decide whether or not to spend the money and I'm REALLY glad I finally 
did it. When all your stuff is nicely organized on top of your bus, you 
can really enjoy the inside of you bus while you're on a road trip. No 
clutter - no mess - it's GREAT.
