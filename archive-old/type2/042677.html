Subject: hot start problem

Hi all,
I'm not currently a list member, so if you would like to respond, pelase do
so at my email address: drumba_at_unity.unity_dot_edu.  I have a 1976 bus with a
1971 upright engine that I recently rebuilt.  It runs great except for a
strange hot starting problem which I can't figure out.  The bus will start
just fine when it is cold, but once the engine is warm, and I've been
driving for a while, it is hard to start when I turn it offf. This makes it
very difficult (and kinda embarassing) to fill up on gas, stop at the post
office, etc.  The negine cranks over fine, but doesn't fire right up like it
does when cold.  Eventually, it will always start though, I've never been
stranded because of this.  Sometimes after it does catch, it will run on
only 2 or 3 cylendars until I rev it up a little, and then it will run great
like always.  If I get it rolling at a half decent clip, and pop start her,
she fires right up every time.  This makes no sense to me. It's not flooded,
as I've taken out spark plugs when this is happening, and they aren't wet.
I'm getting spark.  I can see fuel squirt into the carb when I step on the
gas. It's not any wierd soft of vapor lock, my fuel pump squirts gas when
the problem is happening.  there is always fuel in the filter.  It's not a
hot or bad condensor as a vw mechanic suggested to me, I've replaced it (and
my points, cap and rotor) to make sure.  Has anyone had this sort of
problem?  Does anyone know what might be wrong?  Me, my vw friends, and the
local vw specialist can't figure this one out!  Thanks in advance for any
help.  Email  me at drumba_at_unity.unity_dot_edu
