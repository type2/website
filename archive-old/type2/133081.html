Subject: RE: [T2] FW: correct carbs for 73

Corbett,

If you get them synchronized according to the book, and they are in any 
kind of good shape at all, they will do *very* well.

Follow the instructions in the manual to a &quot;T&quot;!

I had a setup like this long ago on a bus with a stock rebuilt engine and 
it was a screamer...I actually did 105 in the bus early one 
beautiful Saturday morning on an absolutely deserted interstate....I was 
ecstatic!

As always...YMMV as the bus was only a several years old and had brand new 
ball joints and tires all the way around and there was *no* wind.  Loved 
that bus compared to my 67....could haul with the truckers on the 
interstate any day of the week.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I am in the process of installing the stock dual solex carbs. Once I get them

&gt; synchronizing, I figured that since they are stock, they would be pretty easy
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; What problems have people been running into in getting them tuned. Why are the
&gt; webbers much better?
