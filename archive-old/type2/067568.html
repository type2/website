Subject: That &lt;'68 Westy interior is a &gt;'68...

Hi all,

Just an update on the interior I scored - originally posted as
&quot;score!&quot;... On closer examination, the interior, which came out of a
'67, is a '68 or later interior - it has the panel for a sliding door,
and it doesn't have a 'spicerack', so sorry to all of those who wanted
one.

In any case, I still have this entire Westy interior here, just waiting
for someone to make their bus into a home. Drop me a note...
