&gt; 2.0L type IV engine.  I am looking for 0.010&quot; cylinder base spacers

&gt; through Bus Depot (P/N 80510), but they no longer carry them since
&gt; evidently their source (Motorwerks) is no longer in business.  I have
&gt; two questions:
&gt; 1.  Can anyone identify another source for these shims?

I got some from Peek Automotive in Lanham MD, not sure if they still have
em but they are on the web (www.peek_dot_com, I think)
