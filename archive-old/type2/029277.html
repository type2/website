Howdy Folks,
Okay, with the help of the list, all of the engine problems are worked out on new westy/new engine etc on 82 westy.  Now comes the fun stuff.  We are planning a month-long cross-country (tucson to sacramento to DC and back) over the christmas holiday.  I would like to get this thing geared up between now and then with all &quot;necessary&quot; accesories. I have checked the archives on some of this, but I wasn't able to answer all my questions, plus I wanted some fresh recommendations.  Here goes:
1) will 27x8.50x14 fit well with the use of low-profile cable chains for snow?  Any recommendations on cable chain brands/WTB?
2) What is the best way to haul a 16' canoe on the top of this pig?  ive been told both the little foam blocks as well as the yakima racks?  Any opinions?  We intend to pack the luggage rack w/ gas cans, etc... so i don't think the blocks will cut it.
3)  What is a good toilet to buy?  I have seen small (3-3 1/2 gal) to large ((6 gal) units for reasonable prices.  As I have no desire to measure my own output, I don't know what size will be adequate.  i don't mind emptying it, just don't want to do it all the time and don't want to sacrifice size for appetite;-)  We are two adults who drink alot of beer and eat a lot of steak!
4)  I want to add some lights to the front of this thing.  The bus already has halogens (sylvania), but htey are not nearly bright enough, especially off-road.  Has anybody tried any good combinations of offroad/driving/fog lights they would recommend?
5)What shocks are best for heavy loading and offroad driving?  This is one area that i am not afraid to spend money in, so I was considering air-adjustables.  Will they do anything to the ride height?  If so, enough to throw off alignment?

That's all i can think of for now.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I am trying to overdo everything to make this thing as &quot;heavy-duty&quot; as possible as I use this thing heavily off-road and my eyes tend to be bigger than my tires (and please, don't recommend I get a syncro...I have tuition bills and two dogs to feed!)
Thanks much
Mike Edwards
82 Westy 
PS---I caught hte wolfsburg debate last month and several people swore up and down that the wolfsburg edition didn't appear until 1984.  Is this right?  I have an 82 w/ wolfsburg emblems and all hte upgrades?  Did somebody just slap this stuff on?
