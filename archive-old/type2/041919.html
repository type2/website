Subject: Road trip to Eastern Washington State - Trip Report

Hey all.

Just thought i'd post our trip report.  As you might remember we headed out 
to the gorge amphitheater in the washington state desert.  We saw Bob Dylan 
and Phil Lesh!!  What a great time.

It wasn't as hot as it could have been.  Low 80's.  Our bus did wonderful.  
After the Gorge concert we went to the North Cascades National Park in North 
Central Washington state.  It was amazing.  We drove about 2 hours north out 
of the desert and camped.  Then the next day drove about another hour over 
to the mountain range.  then for the next four days we drove about 1/2 hour 
a day to a new campground.

There were two passes going through the range.  The first was Washington 
Pass.  5477 Feet.  This pass was crazy.  the bus pushed on though.  we got 
it down to 2nd gear and cruised slowly.  but just as I thought it was gonna 
end the road took a NO KIDDING complete  U-turn around and switched us back 
up and kept going up the grade another mile or so. It was crazy.  but we 
made it and so did our bus-slowly.  At the top of the pass we did see a late 
70's bay window with bright yellow paint.  He was resting at the top on a 
pull off.  What a great view with glaciers surrounding you as you climbed 
the grade! This was my birthday when we climbed the mountain, Thanks to my 
wonderful bus, he made it a great day.  After the pass we camped out in old 
growth forests for two days and headed home before the weekend crowd came.  
We headed back to portland at 65 MPH and burned a 1/2 quart of oil.  
WHOOAA!!

Has anyone ever done this washington pass??  I am wondering how other busses 
did.

Take care and thanks to all who passed their number along.  Luckily I did 
not need it, but it made me worry alot less!

Peace and Love!

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
