&gt;&gt;This past week a parts book came up in E-Bay, but even
though a couple of us went in on the bid, we were outbid at the last
moment.  I am at the point that I would like to get rid of the parts I will
not be using to restore my busses, but I have no idea what to sell and what
to keep. &lt;&lt;
Gee, sorry, guys, that was me who had to  get up at 5 AM to upbid from $41
at the last minute!   I set a max of $100 with nine min left;  that showed
the high bidder's max was $55 (a clue to that was his bid was earlier than
the next one down in bid history); then a RELOAD just before it ended
jumped to $83! I was burned in the past by the same trick when I tried to
find his max by bidding $5 at a time and got timed out.  (The owner of it
has a 73 Westy and felt sorry for me &amp; will ship it free!) I suppose I
could be convinced to repro it to defray my cost, but wait until it comes
from New Zealand (guy wants CASH).  Hmm- 114 pages at .05 or so a page is
$11.40  minimum?   How about $15 plus postage?
