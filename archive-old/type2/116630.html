Subject: Re: [T2] Very Very Thin Oil

Hey-
Sounds like gas. Could your choke, or float valve be stuck?
Cheers,
Matthew

I am tinkering, and the oil is WAY over capacity.  It seems like it may
smell of gas, but maybe I am paranoid.
I have drained the oil, and it seems to be extremely thin.  It is 30wt
Castrol.
I took it on a drive about 45 minutes ago, so it is a little warm.
If there is something in the oil, making it thin and over capacity, what do
you think it may be?
