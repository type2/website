Subject: RE: [T2] Power Bleeder

Assembly Starting from the tubing end...
1) Tubing,
2) Small hose clamp (probably not needed but I like over kill)
3) brass nipple with threads (from home depot) 
4) metal washer
5) rubber washer
6) reservoir cap
7) rubber washer (biggest you can fit in to cap)
8) nut that threads on to brass nipple

you can eliminate all the washers by using RTV, 
but I like to be able to take it apart if I come up with a better idea... 

I also have (I used this attachment when I did the breaks on my Jetta) an
attachment from my mytee vac, that is a single piece of molded rubber that
looks like a tiny upside-down wide mouth funnel I haven't checked to see if
this would fit into the reservoir cap, but if it does this would eliminate
all the stuff I listed above except
the tubing, cap, and clamp.. 

Hope this makes sense.
If ya'll want pictures let me know..

Hi Mike,
.... more detail on how you implemented a pressure tight seal between the
tube and plastic reservoir cap?
