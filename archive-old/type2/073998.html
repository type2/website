Subject: I Need an Engine for a 72, Bay Area,used o.k.

I'm looking for an engine for my 72 westy, used but running decent or better 
.  I'm in San Rafael, near san francisco.  Any leads will be much 
appreciated.  I don't know which years will swap out, do you?  It was a 
1700.... Also seeking a yard or other space to swap the motors which i 
should be able to do in a day or so based on prior experience.

Thank You,
Shawn
