Subject: RE: [T2] pointless plug gap

The pointless ignition module is only half of a high output ignition
system. The other half is the coil.  You should only open your gap up if
you are running a hotter coil or using a CDI system. You need a higher
voltage to jump a bigger gap. If you have a standard coil, keep the
standard gap. Yes, you may increase the gap a little with a standard
coil, but if you open it up too much, you run the risk of poor or no
spark. The original coil may not have the ability to create a good spark
across that increased gap.

The original coil's voltage is/was limited by the mechanical points. A
pointless trigger mechanism now allows you to run a hotter (higher
voltage) coil.

  Right now they're stock gaps, but I have heard that with pointless
ignition, I might want to open them up a bit.  True/false?  If I did
open them up, how much?
