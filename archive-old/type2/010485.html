Hi Beth,
    I just saw your post to the type2 list about the build up of &quot;greasy 
white junk&quot; and thought I'd put your mind at ease.  My wife Kathy and I had 
a 77 for 20 years and had the same thing happen all the time.  As I 
understand it, that white junk is formed when moisture evaporates out of the 
oil due to engine heat.  It didn't seem to have any ill affects on the 
engine, which lasted about 250,000 miles with just one rebuild.  It was 
still running strong when we took the bus off the road due to rust.
    Just change the oil and filter about every 3000 miles and use a good 
quality oil.
