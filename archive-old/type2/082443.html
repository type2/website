Subject: RE: [T2]  runs rough when cold, won't start when warm

I think there's merit in what both faster-laster and=20
Billy said, but what I don't get is how his engine
ran &quot;smooth for a few seconds&quot; with the fuel line=20
disconnected (no fuel pressure in the fuel ring...)

Starting to wonder if he's got a carb'd engine
in his van.

Check the plugs?
