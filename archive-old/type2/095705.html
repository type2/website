Subject: Re:  [T2] One more question..

Regarding used California vehicles, the real question is: Does it have a
recent (60 days) smog cert?  Any recently smogged, running car in CA is
worth at least $800 - $1,000.  If no smog, it's not legal to sell, and the
new owner would not be able to register it.  The seller is responsible for
getting it smogged before sale.

$800 is probably a good price if smogged; if it can't be smogged, the owner
won't get more than a couple hundred $ for salvage.  If salvage is your
plan, that might work for you, but don't pay $800.

Just because it passed smog last year, doesn't mean that it's any good now.
They ALWAYS say &quot;It'll smog just fine&quot;  If so, have the seller get the
certificate, and reimburse him as part of the selling price if it passes.

Cars older than '73 don't need smog checks (Why the hell did I get a '77
????)
