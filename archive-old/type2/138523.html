Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder Head Paint

Gerald,

I agree with this train of thought, I am curious as to what your opinion is 
on painting tin, I was thinking about painting my fan shroud and cylinder 
head tin pieces and such with super high temp paint.

Would that have any affect on the engines cooling system? (1600 dual)

&gt;For general info, paint is a pretty darn good insulator. The cylinders are
&gt;an integral part of the cooling system and are designed to have air flowing
&gt;over them to remove heat from the pistons.
