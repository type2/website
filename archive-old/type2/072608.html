Subject: tire demounter

Seems as though I am frequently removing my tires from their rims.
Sometimes to paint the rims; sometimes to install port-a-walls.

I would like to have the ability to do this in the garage instead of
trusting the job to a local service station.

In the Northern catalog are listed three gadgets for doing this.

Has anyone used one of these home remedies?  Do they work? Do they injure
the seal or the rim?

Thanks, Jack
