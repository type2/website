Subject: Re: [T2] Gauges

Take the vacuum gauge and stick it in your tool box. Not that important 
(doesn't hurt to have too much info though).

However I think you should send them a bit more money and buy the CHT gauge.

I have 4 gauges in my '78 Westy and in the order of importance is: oil 
pressure, CHT, oil temp, and tach.

The gauges you list are good but not necessary.

Your engine has two temps and neither should be exceeded: Head temps and 
oil temps. Too hot a head leads to dropped valve seats and too hot oil 
leads to oil failure or low oil pressure.

Fuel pressure and vacuum are good but only necessary when you are tuning up 
the engine. If either is out of spec then the engine stalls and no harm 
done. If the CHT or oil pressure or oil temp is out of spec for long then 
you need a new engine. You cannot affect fuel pressure by driving the bus 
incorrectly. Vacuum can help you get better gas mileage if you drive 
carefully and with a light foot.

Also if your bus is being driven by a non-VW person you may find them 
lugging the engine and causing problems by not supplying enough air for the 
cooling system.

I mounted the 3 two inch gauges under the radio and the tach in the clock 
location in the dash.

Good luck.
