Subject: Fuel tank in '72 Westy: PROGRESS!

All:
Just thought I'd finish my string on the fuel tank removal, cleaning and installation in my '72 Westy.

Yes I have the engine out - way out.  I bought a fresh AVP 2.0L w/manual fuel pump case.

The tank was a BAS^%&amp;D to get out, carefully at least, but I finally got it out and to the radiator shop for a good boiling and coating (&quot;RedCoat&quot;, whatever that is - it sure is RED though...).

I glued all the felt strips and plastic pads back on.  I had removed these very carefully with a razor blade prior to cleaning.

Bentley says the following about installation:
&quot;Installation is the reverse of removal.&quot;   ARGHHH!!!

Hey, it went back in a LOT easier than it came out!  Only took about 15 minutes.

If you have your engine out I recommend you remove the panel, get the tank cleaned and coated and put it back in.

This weekend the &quot;new&quot; motor goes in and hopefully I'll be driving my Westy by Monday.
