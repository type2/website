Subject: Rebuild Opinions

    My roommate threw the belt off my bus and figured she could make it
a few miles with the generator light on. Classic example of
lack-of-air-cooled-comprehension. We opted to only rebuild the top
(funds were a problem). About a year and later I crunched up a main
bearing. Bit the bullet and made the investment for a full Tom Noble
rebuild. Two years later it's running like a champ.Thanks Tom!
    Even if it means eating Ramen for a month I recommend doing the
whole thing  while you already have it out and spread all over the
bench. Do it right, do it once.
