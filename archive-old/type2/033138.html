Hello VWer's!

  Early January I will begin living at Acadia National Park, and the east
coast of Maine.  I will be traveling there in my '74 bus, and was
wondering if there were any other VWer's in the area.  Please drop me a
line if you can - I would love to meet some of you when I move.

  Thanks!
