&gt; I have noticed that there seems to be a difference with a 74 bus accel cable for
&gt; Cailifornia models.
&gt;
&gt; How can I determine if my bus  requires a 74 california only cable?
&gt;
&gt; 211721555N is a accel cable listed for 74 Cal only
&gt; 211721555T is for 73-74 NOT Cal

I think 74 Cal was the only place with fuel injectiion that year??

basic differences in accel cables
.  single carb
.  double carb
.  fuel injection
.  auto tranny
