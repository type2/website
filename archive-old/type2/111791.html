Subject: exhaust and the heater box/s

question?
i dont use the heater system in my van and if i was to take the heater boxes loose and run a straight pipe to them how would this affect performance with the engine from pros to cons?
also more importantly will this work...?
i remember reading somewheres where some one took off a heater box and put a straight pipe in there to get them home or something like that cant remember where i read it now but that was like for a a patch job to get them home and if no one has ever heard a engine roar without the heater box or with a large or small hole in the heater box it is loud way loud..not to mention can also warp a valve being that close to the manifold from what i have been told..

curous..
be awhile before i go with a exhaust again(since she is sitting right now) but will need to know ...
if this can be in my options so i can start looking on how and where i will get the pipe needed ..?

thanks and peace
