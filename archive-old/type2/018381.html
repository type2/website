&gt; My engine is stamped with # B6298523 but my vin is 221 204 1800.
&gt; According to Muir, 1993, that engine number is from a 1970 bug.
&gt; Do you all read it that way?

That's not right. This VIN is from a 1971 Microbus. You can read it from
the 1st three numbers in the VIN:
2 --&gt; Type 2
2 --&gt; Microbus
1 --&gt; model year 1971


&gt; It says the last B series ended in 1970 in type 2s with # B 5 230 000.
&gt; My bus year is supposed to have and AE starting number. Muir doesn't
&gt; give all the vin numbers though. He runs through the 21x xxxx xxx 
&gt; series but not the 221s. Maybe they had different numbers? 

It is right that VW only uses 21 numbers when they indicate VIN's. This
is a bit confusing. Actually you shouldn't mind the 2nd number in the
VIN. It is only the 1st (indicating the model, type 1,2,3 or 4) and 3rd
(indicating the model year) number that are important, and of course the
serial number which is indicated by the last six digits. The 4th digit
is not important.

Your bus should have an AE engine. So it probably has been replaced by
an older engine.

&gt; The muffler that's there now looks like it's from a 40hp/1200cc typeI.
&gt; It has no &quot;fresh air heater&quot; contraption (that bulbous appendage
&gt; attached to both sides of the muffler) and the foil air tubes hook
&gt; directly into the heat exchanger.

&gt; Can someone tell me how this &quot;fresh air heater&quot; works as opposed to
&gt; the &quot;stale air heater&quot; or the one like I have that has neither air heater?

That's strange. I would say both 1200 and 1600 mufflers are the same,
except for the fact that the 1600 muffler is a bit wider and has one
exhaust pipe when used on a type 2.
