Subject: Re: [T2] Heater Controls

I replaced my old heater cables to the back and ended up using
one of them to fix the one you are talking about.  If I remember
correctly, it has a &quot;formed&quot; end on the lever end and the other end
is just plain with a clamp.

Got two for the price of one!

Cheers ,dave

&gt; &gt;Have been looking for the heater control cable for a 1974 Westy. The
&gt; &gt;cable measures 16 inches. It attaches to the slider nearest the steering
&gt; &gt;wheel. It has a connector at both ends. Typical looking VW cable.
&gt; &gt;Anybody know where these are available new? Would anyone have a good
&gt; &gt;used that they would part with? Thanks.

&gt; Check with motorcycle or bicycle mechanics - they maybe able to make you 
&gt; what you need.
