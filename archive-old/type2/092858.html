I do have an idea, based on several uses of the key word &quot;DRIVE&quot; in your 
message.

Gasoline is being vaporized when the engine is running. You are smelling 
the vapor.

Observation:  If you can smell it, It can ignite.

So, what is my idea?? Every time you drive your bus you are risking having 
it blow up and burn.

This does not sound like a bus that I would drive....anywhere, for any 
reason, until I had the problem diagnosed and corrected. I hope that you 
are of the same persuasion.

My idea is that you consider not driving the bus.....if you haven't already 
stopped. Fixing it then becomes possible, because you and the bus will both 
continue to exist in your present undamaged forms. AND, I'd carry a fire 
extinguisher even after I have it fixed.
