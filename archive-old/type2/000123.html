Now I pondered a moment before responding, (cause my friends say I'm to off 
the v-dub wall) and I think this may shed some light.  I hear what you are 
saying about the elves and black forest.  I to wonder if the purchase will be 
a once and a lifetime purchase or a mistake.  I choose to delay the purchase 
because I'm fairly confident about the stockpile of type 2 parts.  I would 
however forewarn that with any collector car or hobby, with age comes the 
realism of obsoletion.  Or better worded, when will the type 2 Armageddon 
occur.  Share what you have don't stockpile.  For the part you part with may 
be the one that keeps another's dream out of the junkyard.  Don't by any 
means sell that cherry set of T handles. But use, (replace) them and sell the 
old.  I hate to see another generation of volks get discouraged because of 
this generations greed.  Thus the more on the road the longer original and 
after market parts are available.  I love my V-dubs and the joy they bring me 
and my family, I just have to share what I can and hope others have as many 
memories and tales that I do.  Conclusion being take care of what you got and 
fix it right when the Bread (as moire put) allows.  Don't become a first time 
owner and hope to have a daily driver, realize many call V-dubs a hobby,  and 
that a hobby requires time.  You'll avoid heartache this 
way,  and enjoy what we've got while we got it, no-one really knows when it 
will end.
Peace Out
