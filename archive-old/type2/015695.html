&gt;I have exactly the same symptoms on exactly the same van. I also have a 2L
76 van. Shes called Flossy and shes sick. I live in the UK and have taken
her to a dedicated VW bus emporium near where I live. The chap there seems
to think that it may be a cracked head or a valve. 
&gt;
&gt;He runs a splitty himself and believes that my van sounds much like his
van did when it &quot;mushroomed&quot; a valve. By that he meant that split around
the edge fried mushroom sort of shape.
&gt;
&gt;I am dropping my van to him tomorrow for an engine out, head off
investigation. and when I get some feedback I will let you know what he found.

What you are describing is a &quot;burnt&quot; valve.  It would show up as a loss of
compression in one cylinder, easily verified by a compression test.  No
need to pull the head off.
