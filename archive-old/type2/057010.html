Subject: Bus key chains

I'm normally not a toy and trinket nut, but I came across something
that bus volk might be interested in:

In the Hearthsong (gaack!) catalog, they have die-cast metal bus
keychains in 1:87 scale (about 2 inches long).  They are kombi
splittys, and are available in green, orange, blue, and red (all with
white tops)

Cost is $4.95 each or $3.95 each if you buy 3 or more.  Order #14191

They also have split-window bugs in red, black, pink, yellow, white,
orange, blue, and green.  Same price.  Order #02378

Their number is 800-325-2502.

Seems like a nice little gift for your favorite vehicle!

George Lyle
