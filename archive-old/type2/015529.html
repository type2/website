&gt;I spent my spring break driving from Illinois to Maryland, and back to 
&gt;Illinois.  On my way home I saw 3 buses.  One was Blue and white, one green 
&gt;and white, and I think the 3rd was red and white.  Made me very happy to see 
&gt;other buses on the road.  If anybody saw a green and white bus traveling
on I 
&gt;70 it was probably me. 
&gt;
&gt; I had a question about my bus too.  As I was driving when I would reach 
&gt;about 60mph my bus would start jerking, or bucking I guess you could call
it, 
&gt;but only when I would go 60 or faster.  Sometimes it didn't do it, but for 
&gt;the most part it did.   Any idea why?

Point wear and/or floating and/or maladjustment, worn or cracked
distributor cap/rotor, high resistance in the HT wires, voltage drop at the
coil, poor FI system grounds, worn AFM, poor terminals anywhere in the FI
harness, flaky sensors, funky relays, non-spec mixture adjustment. All
possibles.

Do try making up an auxillary ground wire that attaches to the block, the
AFM, the ECU and the chassis. Amazing how this many times nips this problem
in the bud. But I would verify most of the above first because improving
grounds only works if a grounding problem is contributory to the issue.
