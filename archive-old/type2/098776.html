Subject: Re: [T2] '71, No dash lights??? - #12 fuse ok

OMG! my kids were playing around in the bug or bus one day and when i
turned the lights on (later), the dash didnt light up. I FREAKED! i
thought something had blown or something, but i finally figured out that
they had turned the dimmer down all the way... WHEW! i was SO relieved.
sometimes it is the simplest answer we overlook that ends up being the
right answer. i cant tell you how many times in my life i have felt like
a real dork for not seeing the simple solution.

waving madly through the snow cuz these idiots dont know how to drive in
it,

70 westy
it doesnt snow much here in OK, and it hit suddenly and came down HARD
today... WHAT FUN!

&gt; &gt; I have a '71 Westy with no speedometer light or fuel
&gt; &gt; gauge light.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What could be the problem??
