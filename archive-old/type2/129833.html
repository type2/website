Subject: new exhaust manifold/tappping question

volks,

i got a soundly rebuilt type IV engine that i am currently replacing my
second exhaust manifold stud on. on the first one i developed a technique
similar to the sharp chissle technique. however, this second stud stripped
the case. since then i have drilled the stripped hole and am trying to tap
it. unfortunately my hand drill will not drive the tap. how am i supposed
to lay those threads???
thanks
