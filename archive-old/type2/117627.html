Mark,

Sounds like you have done all of the obvious things...so now, back to the 
drawing board.

Verify that TDC *is* TDC....I suspect you know how.

Then go back thru the engine cycles by hand and watch the valves.
Measure if possible....in other words, a cam going flat???

Had a friend come to me like that one time and he was stumped...turns out 
he had replaced the solid copper plug wires with resistance wires....he 
still had his old ones in the car, so we put them back on, he drove off 
around the block and was so happy, that he came back with a case for 
me.&lt;grin&gt;

I assume that you have checked advance with a timing light and it works?

Does the accelerator pump work?....look(carefully) and see...it is easy to
stop up the little u-shaped accelerator tube and it won't accelerate  
worth a damn, but will idle perfectly all day long....yes, I know you said 
you tried another carb and rebuilt yours, but look again!

Triple check the wires being in the right places...don't ask me how I 
know....it will run, but poorly.

Triple check dp manifold to carb runner seals.

Real interesting!
Cheers, dave
