Subject: GAS in OIL,   FIXED    (yay)

well list, i finally fixed my gas in oil problem.

once again, i have a '77 with 2L FI and hyd, lifters

disconcerted about the steep price of fuel injectors, and unable to sleep
last night (related? prolly) i decided to browse around in the archives. I
found a post that mentioned Lucas fuel injectors sold at autozone and
advanced auto parts for around $30 ea.  today I called autozone and they
knew nothing. I then called Advanced and they indeed had the injectors
(instock even) and they were $30 ea, but they were not made by lucas, but by
GP sorenson. the tips do look a little different, as the archived post said
they would, and they came with all the o-rings, like the post said. i used
the GP o rings on the tips, but the bosch o rings from the old injectors fit
the big end better than the GPs.

so after installing a NEW set of GP sorenson fuel injectors and changing the
oil, gas no longer leaks past the rings when the engine is turned off. $120
for a set of new injectors really beats $240 ($60 x4 boschs from busdepot)
or about $400 (~$95 apiece) from a local place (T Hoff).

thanks to all those who offered me used injectors, but there was really
noone in the neighborhood and i needed the bus TODAY, so....

i did a fuel pressure test after putting in the new inj's, but forgot to
replace the little screw on the rail and tried to start the bus. OOPS.
&quot;D*MN, WHY THE H*LL WON'T IT START?!?  OH YEAH! DUH!  don't i feel like a
jack*ss.

now if i could just figure out that wierd timing thing, and that exhaust
leak, and the heater, and, and, and....

thanks once again list,

PEACE!

PS  those were GP sorenson fuel injectors P/N 800-1507N  at Advanced Auto
Parts. The original post said to ask for '81 vanagon b/c their database
doesn't go back to '77, so that's what i did.
