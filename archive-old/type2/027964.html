	So it's time. After only 15,000 miles, I think my 2L is cooked, and
something is going to have to take its place. I'm entertaining either a
rebuild from AVP or going to a spanking-new Mexican or Brazilian 1600 so I
don't have to worry about anything for a long time. The local guy says that
he's had trouble locating both the motors and the appropriate conversion
tin. Anybody do this recently? I'm really torn about what to do, mostly
because this was my first rebuild and I didn't think it would explode so
soon (next time, I'm pulling the oil galley plugs from the case while it's
still in halves in my kitchen rather than waiting them to blow on the road,
which is what happened) and am hoping to get a few personal stories about
the conversion. Did it work for you?

	Ech. Not looking forward to it,

	Ian
