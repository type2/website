Sounds pretty cool.  Would you mind posting some pictures of the rig?

If you can provide digital images and descriptive text but don't have a
web server on which you can post them, I'd be happy to provide a web space
for them (I'm starting a &quot;Bus hacks and projects&quot; section on my web server
for my '76 Westy).
