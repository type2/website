Hi list,

I was seriously thinking about fabricating an engine test stand for
myself.  Anyone out there have any plans or details on good ideas for
the such.  I have been testing engines  on the ground hooked to an old
tranny.  Would like to make something incorporating this design but up
off the ground. Welding is no problem.  Any helpful hints on what to do
or not to do would be appreciated.
