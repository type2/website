Subject: RE: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

All:  My 74 single cab (originally from Panama) with non-power disk brakes 
is only slightly more difficult to stop than my 79 camper with power brakes. 
  I'm not sure about the master cylinder interchangeability.  greg

My question is there a way to eliminate using the power brake
servo, Maybe be using the earlier 68-70 master cylinder ?  Will
this work with the front disc brakes?
