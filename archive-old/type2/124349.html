Subject: Generator light

Hi Volks ~~
Embarassed as I am, I can't figure out what I thought was a simple problem.
Equipment: 1600 upright engine with generator
Problem: After cranking from cold start, the generator light stays on, like
the belt is slipping. Hit the gas, light goes out.

The problem seems to be getting worse, needing more and more gas to rev the
engine high enough to get the generator light out. I tightened the belt, I
changed the belt, I pushed on the brushes, I cleaned off the neg battery
terminal --- nothing helps.
What gives?
