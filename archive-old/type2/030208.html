Subject: '75 auto trans - can deliver across the south :-)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10106191914070.11342-100000_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Volks,

Nikki and I went junkyarding today and came across a '75 with auto trans
in it.  I have no idea what it will cost or what its condition is, but if
anyone in AZ, NM, TX, AR, TN or VA (or within reasonable sidetrack
distance) wants it, let me know and I will pull and carry it.  As I said,
I also have no idea of what the yard will want or what the condition
is...but if you are interested, let me know this evening or tomorrow
before ~10:00 PDT.

                           Steve Dolan
