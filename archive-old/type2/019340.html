&gt; &gt; Anyone have any &quot;workarounds&quot; for not being able to find a
&gt; &gt;clutch alignment tool.  My buddy says he's known a few people who were able
&gt; &gt;to line things up w/a screwdriver, but I'm not sure I could intuit my way
&gt; &gt;thru' it.

Mark:

On a Type I a Mini-mag flashlight is just about perfect. Insert it thru
the clutch into the pilot hole.  Keep wiggling the flashlight as you
tighten the nuts to be sure you can remove it.

Best of Luck
