Spark advance is a feedback loop between the motor and the distributor. 
The goal of the loop is to create the most efficient explosion in the
combustion chamber.  Because car engines run at variable speeds, the
efficiency variables change with engine load.  This is the idea behind
an advance curve; the rate of change of the efficiency variables are
plotted against the advance characteristics of a distributor.

With the centrifugal advance 009, the lag you feel between the time when
you jam on the accelerator to the time the advance kicks in is a flaw in
the feedback loop for this application.  The motor is suddenly hit with
more fuel and a heavy load (letting out the clutch), but the spark can't
be advanced because the motor isn't spinning fast enough to activate the
weights in the distributor.  And so there is inefficient combustion. 
The motor sputters until finally the engine speed is enough to move the
weights, the advance kicks in, and the motor takes off.  A lighter
vehicle may not have this problem simply because the motor isn't asked
to work as hard off idle, and so it can come up to advance speed more
readily than the heavy vehicle.

A vacuum dizzy takes its advance notification from the carb; when you
jam on the accelerator, a sudden surge of vacuum runs through the carb. 
This vacuum tells the dizzy that the motor just took a big breath, and
so the distributor advances the spark.  The explosion is at that
theoretically ideal point, and so the motor pulls off the line more
readily than its brother/sister using a centrifugal advance distributor.

You might find that revving the motor just a bit before letting out the
clutch will make the vehicle more driveable.  Idea being that the slight
revving will give the 009 the chance to begin advancing the spark (the
centrifugal weights will catch), which will 'stick' the weights  long
enough to overcome that flat spot when you let out the clutch.  Notice
that I'm not saying to slip the clutch; just a slight vroom before you
let out the clutch.

&gt; 
&gt; yeh the normal......
&gt; 
&gt; big flat spot  right off idle......
&gt; 
&gt; stock 34 Solex carb
&gt; 009 distributor (which is probably the problem)
&gt; 
&gt; any ideas ?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks for your advise......
