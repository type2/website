Subject: RE: [T2] Cool funky bus...

I like the stock look and semi-modified stock. But if you are stepping away 
from the factory influence then jump. What a cool M&amp;*#^$ F%^#(* BUS! 
Hummmmm.........how would that look in Sage Green ;D?

&gt;From: Josh Gibbs I saw this bus on the way home from work... pretty cool!  
&gt;Has a F*rd
&gt;engine in it.  Check out the Cadillac seats.  Nice skylights!  Wonder
&gt;what that bumper is from?
