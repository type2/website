Subject: appology to shovelhead was:Re: how i got my bus

DOH! yes theres a reason for it, but either way i end up sounding like a rat 
i ended up having to fly back home to washington for a month, which kinda 
caused more than a few financial hardships (try getting last minute airfare 
fom maryland to washington)...when i came home, i couldnt find your email or 
mail addy ('puter troubles, not to mention im pretty disorganized in how i 
keep addresses, emails, and phone#s, unlabeled on my maching..trust me i 
have more unnamed .txt docs of this than i know what to do). coming back 
after a month, i kinda figured you got sick of waiting, and sent them to the 
next bidder...i guess the bottom line is though, i screwed up several times 
over, and i appologize for it. i honestly hope i didnt cause any troubles. 
no hard feelings (actually, i wouldnt blame you if there were, but i have to 
try?)

&gt;Hey man, what are you doing buying more cars for when you have not paid me 
&gt;for those spindles you bid on last July.  Remember those? You used the name 
&gt;NICK914 back then.
&gt;
&gt;What gives?
