don't clearance the heads, it will make the potential for blowouts even
worse.

Subject: [T2] Clearance Heads or Trim Barrels.....


&gt; Was breaking in my newly re-built Type 4 2459cc
&gt; engine this past weekend when the head at the #4
&gt; cylinder started leaking an burned a nice hole in the
&gt; head near the sealing surface (see
&gt; http://www.jacklockamy_dot_com/032402_Burn_Thru_01
&gt; _640x480.jpg).
&gt;
&gt; After doing some research, I have decided to install
&gt; Copper Head Gaskets (.060&quot; thickness).  My current
&gt; configuration is 8.3:1 CR, Deck height is .048, head
&gt; combustion chambers are 70cc's, bore 105mm
&gt; stroke 71mm.  If add the .060&quot; thick gaskets and
&gt; leave everything the way it is...I will go from 8.3: CR to
&gt; 7.3 CR.  My calculations show that to be a loss of
&gt; about 10 HP.  I would like to have a CR of 8.0:1.
&gt;
&gt; In order to get 8.0:1 CR....I have a choice to make.
&gt; Should I take .057&quot; off the head's sealing surface, or
&gt; trim the barrels .057&quot;.  Clearancing the heads would
&gt; be the easiest since I need to re-surface them
&gt; anyway and the piston/cylinders would not need to
&gt; be removed..... but is that the best course of action.
&gt;
&gt; Opinions, comments and suggestions welcomed.
