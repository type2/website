Subject: Staples for canvas (Stainless or Monel)

Volks,

There are at least three common materials for staples to use in fastening
your new canvas to the top.  regular steel staples will rust, and in
fairly short order.  Stainless will not and Monel will not.  Monel is a
variety of stainless that is supposed to be stronger than regular
stainless. Both are &quot;forever&quot; in that they will not rust (well, not in
this application, but that gets technical) Both are a fair amount more
expensive than the regular staples, but in the quantities you need, a
pittance.  Both the stainless and the monel are available at any West
Marine, or other boating dealer.  Given the cost and difficulty level of
new canvas installation, I would strongly advise not using regular steel.
