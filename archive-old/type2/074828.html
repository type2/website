VW has them----
I got a new one a couple months ago, and the parts manager told me there
were several hundred it their warhouses all over the US.
No problem.

(available again??) 
I went by the Flaps and had a nice conversation with the lovely Glenda.
We were talking about the thermostats for pancakes and she called up a
couple of her dealers. One said they had 100 coming in this week and the
other said they had 150 coming in... Is someone new repoping these? 
Peace Brothers and Sisters,
