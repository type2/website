Subject: Re: [T2] Carpeted pedastals

I have found the rubber seat mats at a few different vendors, but to be
honest my mats are in great condition...I just wanted some of the carpeted
kick panels and mats because I was thinking the carpet would help insulate
the noise and weather, plus they would match my existing front carpet.

I have not dreamed these up. I have seen them, but nobody seems to know
where to get them. Thanks for all of the ideas though. I appreciate people
trying to help me out! Maybe I will do them myself, but I think the ones I
saw looked great!
