Subject: BAttery drain

Is there a way to tell whether or not &quot;juice&quot; is being
sucked out of your battery when apparentl nothing is
on??  I have never had problems with my 71 starting in
cold weather, but the last 2 times I have tried to
start it, the battery has been dead.  Nothing APPEARS
to be on, but I am wondering if something somewhere is
drawing juice form the battery?
