Subject: Tire Question (Donning asbestos flame suit now)

I know this one has been beaten into the ground ,many times here but I want
to know if any of you have tried the following tires and can tell me about
them. I do almost entirely highway driving with a very ocasional gravel
roads. I am trying to decide on a tire and the only one I have heard people
speak highly of is the Michelin Agilis 61. So let me know what you can
about these tires:

Goodyear Wrangler HT Load (C) Speed (R) rated at 1710 lbs max PSI 55
Bridgestone 603V Load (D) Speed(R) rated at 1855 lbs max PSI 65
Dunlop SP LT 5 Load (D) Speed (R) rated at 1855 lbs max PSI 65lbs
