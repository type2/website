Hello, can anyone out there tell me how you determine if 
a distributor is worn out?
Also, I replaced the stock vac adv distributor on my '72 
with a 009 (on the advice of the parts guy at a local 
shop). I have since heard/been told that the 009 has the 
wrong advance characteristics for busses. Mine seems to 
run ok though gas mileage is nothing to write home 
about. 
Perusing catalogs has also engendered some confusion. 
The Bus Depot lists an 050 mech adv dist for 72-79 
busses. Shops I've called loacally say no such thing has 
been made for some time. SCAT's online catalog says a 
009 IS suitable for all type 4 engines. However, they 
only mention engine type not vehicle.
any advice/comments will be greatly appreciated
