&gt; &gt; If you run a higher CR with the fuel we have today, you will have
&gt; &gt; overheating problems.
&gt;
&gt; No offense, but that's so far from fact that it isn't even funny. Just to
be
&gt; honest.

As you probably know, honesty isn't always the best policy.  And statements
that start out &quot;No offense&quot; typically are perceived to be offensive by the
recipient, particularly when the statement doesn't gently correct the
original speaker's error(s).

Maybe you could expand upon your answer since I'm not sure what you're
saying here.  What part of the statement is so far from fact?

Is it that a higher CR *won't* lead to overheating?  Doesn't higher CR,
generally speaking, mean more power, which means more heat, which *can* lead
to overheating?

Or is it the part about &quot;the fuel we have today&quot;?  I know gasoline is
formulated differently than it was, say, 30 years ago, but I'm not sure if
it's a factor in higher CR leading to possible overheating.
