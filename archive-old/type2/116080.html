&gt; What I'm having trouble w/ is cutting the butt joints.

You need something called a tubing notcher.

Do a google for tubing notcher and you will find all sorts of them. Some are
like a purpose built hole saw drill press rig, others use a shearing action,
like a giant fingernail clipper.

I would spend some time making the hole-saw type in a jig. If you have a
drill press, you could manufacture a pretty good jig to hold the parts
during drilling. I've made lots of this type of fixture and one rule of
thumb is that it can't be built too strong. A good jig is usually quite
massive and heavy. Even with a good had drill you can do it, but it is all
in how you design and make the fixture. If the holesaw is chattering you
either need a different cutter, a better way to hold the work, a slower
drilling speed or all of the above. Use cutting fluid also.
