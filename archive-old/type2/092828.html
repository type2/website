Subject: Small town resources - encouragement

I live in a small town of about twenty thousand people. In the few years 
that I've lived here I've discovered all sorts of resources.

Rather than to rely on services far away and pay shipping charges, I've 
discovered many of the things I need are here locally or I can make the 
hour or slightly more drive to the next big city (Knox, Nash, or Chatt).

Locally we have a Mom and Pop joint that does powdercoating. I have done 
enough business with them that Jan, the owner knows me and I always visit 
with her for a while when I bring her some work. She offers about ever 
shade of color that you could need and she can match colors too.

Her small company, a &quot;job shop&quot;  - a small company that contracts for 
orders of custom made parts for small manufacturing companies - can also do 
very nice custom tubing bending. What I saw would be suitable for homebuilt 
turbos, roll cages, custom exhaust, etc. They do nice work that has no 
wrinkles in the curves.

We also have some industrial suppliers that can supply me with 
refrigeration parts for refurbishing my VW a/c system, other companies can 
supply sound deadening materials, and we have great upholstery material 
shops here. Lastly we have a great machine shop and they can send parts out 
to Nashville (if I don't want to go) to have rotating assemblies balanced.

My point is in the process of building or restoring or repairing your VW, 
look around, make some calls, go visit the commerical suppliers and shops 
in your area. Just because you are in a small town, doesn't mean you are 
isolated!!!

Go get 'em folks!!!

Ciao!
