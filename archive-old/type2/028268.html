Tearing down 2.0 liter yesterday (I had to pull the heads anyway and then could see wear on the camshaft lobes. Doh!)...found one of my pushrods had a spot about 1/2&quot; long where it had milled itself. Okay, something in the engine milled it; it may have been from a bent pushrod tube (maybe bent at the inside lip), but I'm not sure.

Very interesting thing...would probably have been an interesting sound when this puppy snapped in half.

Anyway, like I said.._dot_camshaft wear: This engine has hydraulic lifters and I'll assume the appropriate camshaft. It's from a '77, I think, but I don't know for sure that the camshaft is correct for it. From what I can see (pre-case splitting), the camshaft appears to be a little dished just before the lobes.

Comments, questions, concerns appreciated.

Thanks! Joe
