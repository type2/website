Subject: Re: [T2] Living in a Bus

Guys:
	this sparks a lot of conversation for people on both sides, but
before &quot;ADMIN&quot; appears I would suggest everyone just kill the thread.
It has digressed to something not really related to the purpose of
this list. 

Those who want to help our first poster can do so w/ p-mail to
whatever extent they feel necessary. Those who choose the other side
can simply not p-mail him. Everyone take care and go drive those
busses :)
