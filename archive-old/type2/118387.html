Subject: Re: [T2] 82 Vanagon Heat Exchanger/Exhaust hangers?

There are supports for the rear exhaust at both the left and right sides.
These supports bolt on to the cooling fan shroud and then attach to the
exhaust.  I believe you can see the right-side piece in the diagrams for the
cooling system.  The left-side piece varies depending on whether the exhaust
is Federal or California; didn't see this piece in my quick look at the
usual sources.

&gt; Hi All:
&gt;
&gt; I am getting ready to mount the heat exchangers and exhaust to my new
&gt; engine for my 82 Vanagon. I am sure that there must be something else
&gt; that holds up the rear portion or the heat exchangers and supports some
&gt; of the weight of the exhaust. I have looked at the parts disassembly
&gt; diagrams on my ETKA, Bentley's and Haynes, but do not see anything like
&gt; this. I know that the older buses had something, any idea what the
&gt; Vanagons used?
