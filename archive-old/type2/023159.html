Subject: door lock question
Mime-Version: 1.0

alrighty,

i recently noticed that the rear hatch lock looked different (not original) 
than all of the rest...well, it's black instead of chrome.

so, i thought, sh*t, i've never tried to lock this door, because there was 
no need since it has been sitting on private property.  anyway, of course, 
the key for the front doors/ignition doesn't work the hatch door, or for 
that matter, the engine door compartment.

so..._dot_can i get a locksmith or someone to make a key for these locks?  or 
do i have to buy a new lock?  if so, can i just buy the lock and key and 
not the whole handle?

thanks volks...on my cross-country venture...i will need a locked vehicle!
