Subject: Friday: Rap on Apples

Rap on Apples
---------------

What, then, is the story of the apple?

When it comes to metaphors, the apple
is king. Everything in life can be said
to be like it. &quot;She is the apple of my eye&quot;.
&quot;Mom, hotdogs, and apple pie&quot;. &quot;He is a
bad apple&quot;. Whoever said life is like
a bowl of cherries has obviously never
bitten into a North Carolina grown Hoover.

As is everything else in philosophy,
the Volkswagen bus is like an apple.

Look closely at the entries in your local
VW show. You will see pristene buses.
Unblemished. Perfect as the day they were
rolled onto the showroom floor. These are
the store-bought apples. Bright red and
buffed to a glossy shine. Impervious to
blemishes and ready to be gobbled up by
a hungry public. Sealing Wax Red Delicious.

But alluring as it is, this is not the
apple for me. I want something with a bit
more will. A bit of a &quot;screw you&quot; attitude.
Rusted floor? Tough twinkies.

Thoreau appreciated this quality in the wild
apple. Wild apples do not give a damn about
what people think of them. If they are sour,
good! Spit out that nasty bite and throw the
rest as far as you can. Thanks. You are
spreading the seed.

But rose-colored glasses aside, if you turn
an apple of this sort, you may find a disgusting
blemish. Rust-through, leaky windows, stranded
on I-40. The list continues. &quot;Great project bus&quot;
they say. &quot;It can be restored&quot; they say. What they
don't get is that it is what it is: a beaten
old bus! It took thirty years of weathering
to get the paint that way. Repaint it? Never!

But if it is turned far enough, one may find
that the crabapple conceals something
unanticipated. A festering spot even Thoreau
would find unpaletable. Cut it out and eat
the rest? Or throw away the whole thing?
The question is more about one's self than
the apple. Similarly with the bus.

What then is the story of the apple? Look no
further than your own garage.
