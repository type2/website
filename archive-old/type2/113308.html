Subject: RE: [T2] Alternator, rebuilt, high output, lifetime fact

&gt; You didn't say anything about voltage, as in what voltage you are seeing at
&gt; the battery during charging.  Maybe you just didn't include this in your
&gt; post, but I don't see how you can hope to diagnose your problem without
&gt; spending a lot of time with the voltmeter.

I spent alot of time with the voltmeter - even running with it on my dash and
connected to the fat red wire underneath. I get the same thing no matter what:

About 11.5-12V until the engine is brought up to 3000RPM the first time - then
13.3-13.5V.

This is 'right' according the factory specs - but is this right for newer
batteries?

&gt; You won't hear that from me.  GMRS radios have a longer range than FRS and
&gt; the prices on them have dropped to where they are affordable.  In my

There is no real difference in price now for GMRS - except that they require
an FCC license to operate. FRS looks like it does everything I need.

Maybe the $0/fry's FRS for now and GMRS later...
