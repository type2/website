Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Tell us about YOUR heat

When I re-assembled my '78 Westy, I made sure all of the factory heater
parts were intact and sealed. I also made sure my front fresh air vent was
sealed and that my door seals and window seals were good. I also made sure
my thermostat and all my tin were intact and working. I am glad to report
that my heating system works excellent without modifications. It isn't HOT,
but that is what a jacket is for in the winter. If you can't see your
breath, it's working at factory specs! :)

(this goes for my '68 Double Cab as well, all intact factory parts)

I think I should have been clearer... We all know gas heaters are
great, but what about using the existing system?

Before I found the BA6 (at the junkyard, woot!) my plan was to use a
pair of blowers sucking air from the cabin and pushing it through the
HE's. I'm wondering if the boost is enough in sub-zero temps, or if I
really have to put the gas heater in the bus to keep it toasty at 12k
feet in January.
