Subject: Header help

Has anyone seen a header like this out there...It's a 2 trapezoid flanged, 4
in 1 header. The flanges have one bolt on top and two on the bottom and attach
to after market manifolds. This exhaust system is definitely not stock. I took
the bus to a custom exhaust shop and they were unable to locate one. I was
hoping that some listsers might know a good source for VW headers online or
can refer me to a good shop locally to order from. It's on an 80' Vanagon. Any
leads?

Thanks-
