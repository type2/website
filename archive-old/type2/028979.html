Melissa,

The mechanical parts that I am referring to would be #'s 9 and 10 that
connect to the wiper motor arm not shown and part # 1 spindle. If these are
in place then I would have to go with the others and say your wiper motor is
faulty. The switch that I was referring to was for an earlier bus when the
switch was on the dash should be a problem, but I would check the wires at
the wiper motor. There are three hot wires, fast, slow and off. The off
cycles the motor one more revolution to put it in park. This could be your
internal motor problem I hope this helps.

&gt;There are connecting rods that attaches the motor arm to the wiper arms
&gt;these silver metal rods just snap into the pivot. When the motor is of via
&gt;the ignition switch for know look up under the dash and see if one looks to
&gt;be hanging. You can pull the glove box off pretty quick to see the wiper
&gt;rack a little better. If this is not the problem then the nut on the motor
&gt;arm came off.

are you refering to the switch on the steering column?


&gt;Ok switch. Either you have a faulty switch, na I think that if you reach up
&gt;under the dash and grab the back of the switch you will feel that it is
&gt;loose. You will need to unscrew the knob and get a pair of snap ring pliers
&gt;to tighten the flat washer looking nut with two grooves in it.
