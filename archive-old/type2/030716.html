There's a few more VW people in the world, folks...

Had some friends over the other night, showed them the bus, which is
currently residing in my basement with the W/D and the lawn equipment
while awaiting a heart transplant.

AMAZING reactions!  I made some curtains with coordinating pillows and
napkins out of a madras plaid material a few weeks ago, and this really
brightened the bus up.  The women were astonished at the total coolness
factor of the vehicle.  Much more so than the men, I should say.

I think it's the pillows.  Women love coordinating pillows.

I mean, they went nuts!  Three of the women that have visited our house in
the past month that saw the bus went home pestering their husbands
to buy a VW camper.  Three out of five.  That's a high percentage.

Again, it has to be the curtains.  Nobody even noticed it before.

My wife is now working on a master decorating plan, replete with a vision
of new seat upholstery, carpet, awning, and entire tikitorch
moodlighting/ambiance camping setup for the shows and campouts.  

Napkins.  Napkins started this transformation.

I highly recommend that anyone out there with a less-than-sympathetic
spouse try the tack of redecoration.  Pick out one thing, finish it, and
then she will(hopefully) become inspired.  

So now I have to look for suitable rolling playhouses for all of our
friends.  I'm sure their husbands will be thrilled.

Staying sane,

Blake
