Subject: Re: T2] Oil Temp Sender Wire Length

The wire length (within reason) should not matter for oil temp. This sender
changes it's resistance with temperature by a fairly large amount, and the
gauge measures the voltage drop relative to bus voltage (12 ish). A little
extra wire would add a very small resistance, which would be negligible
compared to the sender's resistance.

The CHT sensor actually generates it's own tiny voltage, which the gauge
measures.  A small change in resistance by adding wire might have a
significant effect on the reading. With the CHT you'd have to try it and see
what happens.

So, I read somewhere that you should not cut the length the sending wire
from a CHT sender, or risk getting incorrect temps. Does the same hold true
for an oil temp sender?

I have the sump plate sender, but the VDO gauge is reading (what I consider
to be) low. If the (18 AWG) wire length does matter, what's the correct
length?

Thanks -
