I agree.  I trim the foam seal so there is a 3 inch gap front and center of
my engine compartment.  Among my bus's other problems, overheating has not
been an issue.

&gt; Actually IF the gap is between the Fire wall and  the motor--Its  a good
thing! as the air
&gt; that IS coming in to the engine compartment is Not the Hot exhaust
air--Some people i know
&gt; actually create an opening there--It gives the air coming in a &quot;Turbo&quot;
effect. I know many
&gt; will tell you to Seal the engine compartment the best you can  Which IS a
good thing--But
&gt; from my experience with heat in Phoenix--
&gt; This &quot;Turbo&quot; air coming in--on the firewall side of the motor--really
works--TWWM, uj
