Subject: Re: [T2] Points?

Karma, plus 1500 mile tuneups for my points and solid lifters give me
something to do.

10 or 12 sets of points later, and you could have had yourself a new
electronic ignition. I'm a purist about some things, but setting dwell and
gapping an archaic spring mechanism goes a bit beyond my need to keep it
original. Anybody care to expand on why you would want to keep your
points(beyond the need out of necessity)?
