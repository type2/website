Subject: bar and chain oil

   Two years ago I undercoated with bar chain oil after painted all small rust
spots with por 15, It still looks like I did it yesterday. Just a light oil
covering on everything.It also made the bus much quieter I covered the
driveway with plastic to save the environment.
