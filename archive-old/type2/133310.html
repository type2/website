&gt; &gt; I got all excited the other week when I read an article in a
&gt; &gt; wheelchair-based magazine about a guy who drove a standard transmission bus
&gt; &gt; with German-made handcontrols.  Calls were made, emails were sent and I
&gt; &gt; tracked him down only to find that the bus was long gone and he had
&gt; &gt; purchased the controls in a tiny machine shop somewhere in Germany in about
&gt; &gt; 1973.  I was being born at about that time.

the GuidoSimplex hand control is made in Italy the official website is
www.guidosimplex.it      unfortunately it is in Italian

the only English link I can find is
www.davincimobility.co_dot_uk

&gt; Hand controls are very hard to get, mostly due to the liability involved
&gt; in their manufacture.
&gt;
