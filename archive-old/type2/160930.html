Sorry, I just noticed this. Please my post on cooling tins #4 to see what
kind of mess I have to deal with. I think I may have found a source for all
of the tins I need and a mustache bar and heat exchangers and crank pulley
at a REASONABLE price . Cross your fingers!

&gt; Ron, that looks totally inadequate: here is a letter I wrote to another
&gt; guy with the same setup. I will add this: by using the tin off an old
&gt; threshold plate I was able to use the stock seal on the rear of the
&gt; engine. This eliminates the hot air getting sucked up into the engine
&gt; bay, and it looks clean and almost stock. The engine runs cooler, too.
&gt; Do you have a bus engine case with the three holes to mount the
&gt; moustache bar to? Did you notice how they  did the rear mount? Timo
