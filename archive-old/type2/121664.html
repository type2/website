Subject: An early x-mas present (or &quot;how I returned to the list&quot;)

Almost a year ago I sold our 78 westy (didn't fit well, needed the garage, never could find the time to work on her) and parted ways with the list. Sad.

But some things can't be avoided for too long. A client of mine had to get rid of his 78 Champagne and dropped it off this weekend. He said he wanted it 'to be in good hands' (me? uh...), signed the title over and promised he'd locate and deliver the records.

Wow! A bus again! And for FREE!!

Only a couple problems. While it has been religously maintained mechanically, it's early life in TX baked the paint and melted the interior. Then it was brought to the east coast where rust blossomed. And blossomed. No rust through, however it needs what little paint remains removed (along with the rust) and new stuff applied. The engine is original (never opened), but w/ 126k on it I'd think that it's not too long for this world. Hmmm...

If anyone has some good reccomendations on techniques removing paint (sandblasting? Are there afffordable kits for use at home?) I'd love to hear them !!

thanks,

john
