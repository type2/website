I hate that little hose.  I first discovered it while leaving a gas
station.  It's an odd moment when you are trying to understand why
fuel seems to be leaking from your spare tire wheel well.  A couple
of minutes and one fuel soaked long sleeve shirt later and the
culprit was located.  Popped over to NAPA, conveniently 3 blocks
away and they cut me a 2 inch piece of fuel line with the correct
inside diameter for nothing (really cool of them BTW).

Anyway, I went to the link that Richard provided and I loved that
diagram that he has posted on the ventilation system.  Does anybody
know what that T connector in that diagram labeled as 15A is called
?  or the VW part number for it maybe?  I've got two buses of the
same year and that part is cracking on both.  Kinda want to keep my
engine compartment free of gasoline/petrol, dripping down on top of
a hot type 4 motor...

Living in Oregon state, where it's actually the law that the gas
station attendant pump your gas.  Nice in cold weather, but
typically sux as these guys always top the thing way off in order to
make extra money for the station, they also are in the habit of
letting fuel run down the paint and not wiping it dry after they
have put way too much gas into your VW.  So you have to get out of
the bus in order to watch them and remind them that you DON'T want
them to top it off and then wipe the side of the bus off when they
dribble.  Stupid law, since I have to get out anyway because they
never pump gas right.  Okay I'm off of my soap box,.... anybody know
that part number for that T connector?  hehe
