I just replaced the driver's side ebrake cable on our 78. We got the cable
from a local NAPA. It came with the hoses, etc. This might not sound
helpful, but once you get the replacement, it's pretty obvious how to
install it (reverse of removal, sans vice grips! :) ) And I'm speaking as a
non-expert. Don't forget to grease the cable! Make sure your rear brakes
are adjusted properly before adjusting the ebrake cables. Good luck!
