Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Leak

The leak is on #3 and #4 side of the motor, I
&gt; replaced the push rod tube gaskets, oil drain plug gasket. The seems or
&gt; looks like its leaking from #4 intake (I think) push rod tube. The oil is
&gt; also on the cooling tin and around the cylinders. &gt;
&gt; Thanks in Advance

I have had a similar leak showing at that point. It was from the oil
pressure sender. They can leak from the top around the plastic or from the
base.

Check this area.
