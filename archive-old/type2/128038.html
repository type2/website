Subject: H4 Headlight Question

Looking for advice and opinions on upgrading Possum's headlights to the H4. Is this as simple as plugging in new bulbs or do I need additional relays wiring etc? Comments and personal experiences appreciated. 
 
http://www.blimpvw_dot_com/lights.html    Are these junk?
 
Thanks
