My recently rebuilt '72 bus has a problem with the gearshifter popping up and
out of place leaving me stuck in whatever gear it was in until I can get it
reseated back in the shift rod.  This presents a major problem if on the
highway or any distance away from home.  It has happened twice.  When I get it
back in place it seems as if it doesn't seat very deep into the shift rod.  Am
I missing some sort of collar of something that keeps the gearshifter in it's
place? I have all the pieces for the assembly that are shown in the Bentley.
Has anyone else experienced this problem?  What can I do to prevent it from
happening again?

Peace,
