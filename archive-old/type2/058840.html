Sorry to hear of the untimely death of your engine.

&gt;1) What could possibly have caused this? Has anyone ever seen this happen
&gt;before?

I've never heard of such a thing happening before.  The only thing I can
think of would be that some piece of metal must have gotten in the teeth
and when the cam gear met the crank gear, kablooie.

&gt;2)What will be salvagable in the case?  I have less than 50K miles on a very
&gt;thorough and very expensive rebuild.( New german P &amp; C's, Mark Stephens heads,
&gt;new cam and lifters, bearings, gaskets etc. )   For obvious reasons I want to
&gt;save as many parts as possible.  What really stinks is that this engine has
&gt;been very well taken care of (oil changes every 1500 miles etc.) and has been
&gt;running absolutely great.

The heads shouldn't be hurt, and they are the most expensive part of the
engine I'll bet.  I'd have the crank checked and if it straight, it should
be okay to reuse it.  Ditto the rods.  I would replace all bearings and the
camshaft.  Disassemble the oil pump completely and clean it out.  Have the
case thoroughly cleaned till there is no chance there could be any metal
pieces in the journals.  Check the cylinder walls carefully for scoring.
Probably a good idea to remove the rings and check them.  If the
rings/cylinders/pistons look okay I don't see why they could not be reused.
You are looking at a lot of work and $200-$300 in parts assuming the crank
and rods check out..  Could be worse.
&gt;
&gt;3) Can the oil cooler be cleaned and saved?   Its almost new and I hate to buy
&gt;another.

If there was metal circulating in your engine there is always a chance that
a piece got lodged in your cooler and will stay put until you are in the
middle of Alaska or Death valley, then come loose and cause your cam gear
to break apart.  How much of a chance is there?  Hard to say.  Some
mechanics blow solvent and compressed air through the cooler and say that
you have a better chance of dying in a plane crash than having future
trouble with the cooler.  Other mechanics (usually the ones with expensive,
squeaky clean shops) will tell you to throw that cooler away and buy a new
one, even though it hurts.  Which way you choose just depends on how much
of a gambler you are.  If it were me I would probably re-use the old cooler
after it had been thoroughly cleaned although I'll probably get flamed for
saying it.  You might try to find a &quot;rebuilt&quot; cooler which may have come
from an engine that did not die the way yours did (circulating metal
pieces) and thus would be more likely to be completely free of
contaminates.  Or, now might be a good time to go to an external cooler,
which you can buy brand new for cheap.

Engines are a crap shoot.  There is always a chance, no matter how well you
prepare (and this case is a perfect example) that your engine will fail
unexpectedly.  That's the nature of complex mechanical devices - there are
way too many things that can go wrong.  Questions like, &quot;should I buy a new
oil cooler after a catastrophic engine failure or just clean the old one&quot;
and &quot;Should I put in a new clutch while I have the engine out or leave the
old one alone&quot; don't really mean a whole lot since choosing one option over
the other probably doesn't change the probability of failure very much.
Either way, there is still a chance of failure.  You can throw tons of
money at a VW engine by taking every possible precaution, or you can make
educated guesses, save some money and probably still have a long lasting
engine.  That's what I think.
