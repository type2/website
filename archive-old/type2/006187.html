&gt;I've statically timed it (verified #1 was at TDC, checked alignment of the

If all else fails, I'd recheck where #1 TDC is, especially after a rebuild,
as 2 out of our 3 new vehicles in last year had markings WAY off. I had to
watch valves on #3, a-la-Karl Von Salzen, to establish the true TDC for # 1.

Good luck..Marv Krupp
