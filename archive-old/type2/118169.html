Subject: A few questions about your bus

I am in the midst of an off list discussion of European delivery vs. 
US delivery 1968 to 1979 buses. I want to offer some questions to the 
list and if you choose to reply please do so directly to me so as not 
to clog up the list with mail. The questions really relate to 
passenger buses but if you have a NON- Westfalia camper such as 
Sundial, Riviera, Adventurwagen etc the info will be helpful.

Here are the questions.

If you have a passenger bus what is TYP designation on the chassis 
plate behind the passenger seat? example TYP 28, TYP 22 etc

Is your bus a 7 seater , 8 seater or 9 seater?

What are the first four digits of the VIN and what model year is your bus?

Was it a US delivery bus or a tourist delivery bus, or privately 
imported? A clue would be if the M-plate has UT ( tourist delivery ) 
or U(x) where x can be any letter for US port of delivery.

Thanks for your help.
