Vacuum leaks are #1 problem IMHO for our old buses
nowadays. The preformed hoses have hardened and often
fall off when we hit a big bump like RR crossings. The
worst part is they look like they're still on.

I assume you have checked all your hoses thoroughly -
if not, you need to. Pull the &quot;S&quot; hose off also and
check it for cracks. I have heard that shoe-goo works
to seal them. A fews years back I dug through some
bins of S hoses at a wrecking yard. I must have looked
at 200 hoses and only about 10 were good (no cracks.)

Usually AFM problems show themselves in this manner:
You usually drive at a certain cruising speed. The PC
board wears most at that spot. The symptom is while
you are cruising along on flat road with no particular
load, the engine stops running. As you change your
position on the throttle, it runs again. That is the
worn spot and while you're above it and below it, all
works fine. Unless you have a problem like that or no
explanation for a lean condition, I wouldn't mess
around with the AFM.

When you get those injector seals, you might want to
check the stuff in my photo album about the subject.
How I installed the retainer doughnuts caused me to
seize a piston. Link is in my sig.

If there are no vacuum leaks, the symptoms indicate
bad double relay. Incidentally - you can plug both
those circuits and see how it runs then. You'll likely
need the air bypass in winter (I had mine disconnected
for years though) and the decel valve - why are you
still even using it? No- never mind, but have you
tried driving without it? You'll have much snappier
response when backing off the throttle - it won't run
on as it does and will begin immediately to
decellerate. It will make some more popping sounds in
the exhaust but I personally preferred the improved
driveability. -BaH
