Subject: No start after tank draining solved???

Re nos tart after tank drain, and ign was on about 1/2 hr.....

Well, with Nyssa's help, we figured out that the double relay sends 
current, Pertronics ignition is fine (timing light flashes, spark jumps 
1/4&quot; to ground), and pump seemed to run when AFM contacts were closed. 
So I dug out the fuel pressure gauge and teed it into the rail.  WTF, 
the pressure couldn't make it to 20 over the 10 seconds of cranking, and 
you could hear a &quot;catch&quot; just at the beginning of startert running.  So 
I got a jug and aimed the output of the gauge (it has a button to push)- 
it flowed weakly, and then strongly- and bus ran fine after that. 
Pressure 40 with no vac on regulator, 32 with vacuum.  Once could argue 
blockage as I drained the tank (but it was clean last Aug when put in)- 
or possibly some crud entered the hose as I did change the filter.  I 
pulled the gas line to filter and it flows well, checked the inlet of 
the pump (it has no screen).  I still wonder what was wrong...........
