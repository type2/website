&gt;Now I am going to tear down the engine and take the crankshaft out. But I
&gt;am not a real big fan of getting the end holes redrilled. I figure if I
&gt;got it out, Replace it with a new one....But will it effect the engine
&gt;performance because a new one will not have the same wear pattern as the

Since you need a new crank, you might as well do a complete rebuild.  The
wear pattern is meaningless because you were also going to put new bearings
in, right?  Another $100 gets you new pistons and cylinders, about $300
more would get you brand spankin' new heads, considerably less would get
yours re-worked, etc.  I recently posted a whole list of &quot;while you're in
there&quot; stuff.
