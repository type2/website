First off, I want to thank everyone who helped to get Star up and
running! Thank you!

     O.K. First we started with a new head sensor, after that it would
run some what, but like crap. Next a compression test was done, number
four was at 0 psi( oh sh!t), well we pulled the valve cover to see if
there was a dropped seat and low and behold the intake valve spring was
broken, in two spots. Got that changed, and the injector was not working
properly, so that was replaced. Now it runs like before, Great. So
Thanks Again!

Thanks,
