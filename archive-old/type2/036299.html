Subject: Re: smelly left turn - gas filler tube fix?

I had the same problem in my 78 Westy-lower large rubber connector
between tank and fill pipe had little cracks in it.  Fixed it in situ by
removing the &quot;brain&quot; and working through the hole, covered the old pipe
connector with silicone calk, followed by a wrapped layer of flashing
(cut from aluminum stock) that had more silicone gooped on it.  Put hose
clamps around this and cranked it tight- voila, no more smell.  I also
have a cracked inlet elbow, but fill my own tank (so they don't jab it
with the gas nozzle) and stop at the first click.
