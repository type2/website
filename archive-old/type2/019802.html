&gt; Michelin need the individual  axle weights front and rear to give accurate
&gt; pressure recommendations.
&gt; The bus is a 'Standard'  Westfalia if there is such a thing- 5 seat, 5 bed,
&gt; coolbox, wardrobe, tables etc.
&gt; It weighed 1.34 tonne total.
&gt; Does anyone have even a rough idea of the individual axle weights so I can
&gt; at least start running at more realistic tyre pressures ?

Inside my driver's door jamb is a Vehicle Identification
Number (VIN) sticker.  It should bear the month/year of
your vehicle's manufacture, serial number, etc.  Look at
the bottom margin of this VIN sticker and you'll find
something that looks like this:

GVWR  LB.  4961
GAWR  LB.  FRONT 2227 / REAR 2800

I think these may be the numbers you are looking for.
They came off my Deluxe Westfalia made in May/1973
and sold in California.


You could use the tyre pressures listed in the owner's
manual and on the sticker inside the fuel filler door.

I think you are on the right track asking Michelin for
their recommendation.  I have Bridgestone RD603 tyres,
and Bridgestone was happy to provide this information.

Best of luck,
