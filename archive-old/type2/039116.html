&gt; George, hate to disagree with you, but jump starting from a marine or 
&gt; standard deep cycle will not damage the batt.

_Some_ deep cycle batteries are rated for starting loads.  Others are not
and are labeled as such.  The plate construction of starting and
deep-cycle batteries are considerably different and trying to make one
kind of battery fulfill both roles is fairly tough.

&gt; All boats, with multi-batt 
&gt; systems, usually have a switch( generically called a Perko or Guest switch, 
&gt; after the popular makers of the same) that allows you to cycle between all 
&gt; batts(including deep cycle, or &quot;house&quot; batts, as they are known in the 
&gt; industry) depending on circumstance. I've owned all sorts of watercraft over 
&gt; the years, and am also a factory certified master marine tech., and can tell 
&gt; you from experience that I've never destroyed or even shortened the life span 
&gt; of a deep cycle batt. by  occasionally requesting it to act as a cranker 
&gt; batt.Every batt. maker that I've talked to(and I've talked to them all, 
&gt; nothing is as short lived as a batt used for marine application, with the 
&gt; exception of a customers temper, who just shelled out mucho bucks for a new 
&gt; batt last season, only to find it kaput at the begining of this one) have 
&gt; stated that using a deep cycle as an occasional cranker will not harm the 
&gt; batt, and is in fact, par for the course. Now pounding the hell out of a wet 
&gt; cell deep cycle batt. while running through high seas is a completly 
&gt; different can 'O worms...

I've had different experiences with them.  the first deep cycle battery I
owned died after I tried to jump my camper's engine from it.  It was about
a year old and shorted the plates in one cell, yielding a 10V battery.
I've seen similar occurances with others in my camping circle.  I gave up
and went back to the $50 Pep Boys starting batteries with 6-year
warranties.  They don't have the same total capacity, but they do well for
one-or two- night trips.
