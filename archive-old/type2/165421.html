&gt; HI All
&gt;
&gt; I just got back to my email. Thanks for all the suggestions.  I forgot to
&gt; give my year, I have a 1980 manual trans air cooled Westfalia.

Oh, you have a vanagon, not a baywindow, so our suggestions about engine
bay number locations might not be valid.  Check for data plates around the
driver's area.  You might want to ask the Vanagon list as they are more
knowledgeable than we about your bus.
