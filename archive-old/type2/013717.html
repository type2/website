&gt;    So when I take my heads into the machine shop on Monday, do I tell them
&gt;to stake, swedge, or peen or any combo of the 3?  Staking sounds to make
&gt;more sense, but I really don't know.  I've decided on nickel valve seats and
&gt;stainless steel valves.  Judging from the condition of my engine and heads

Isaiah you are missing a big point here.  No local shop is going to be
smart enough to do any of the above.  You need to go with a &quot;quality&quot;
rebuilder or someone who at least has a clue about the T4 VW head.
No local guy (unless you are in CA or Boston) is going to be this guy
unless you have a very good VW air cooled speed/machine shop who
does seats, and even then T1 guys don't much touch the T4 head.

What you are most likely to do before somebody takes you for a bunch
of money is just send what you got to AVP or to Bob Donalds.  I'm not
saying either is the best in the world and I've seen both of their work.
But they do know the beast.  If the heads are trash (as is a sunk seat)
you'd be better to go AVP but the product may not be as good as Bob's.
Bob only wants to work good cores to keep his profits up and I'm not
swearing the product is better.  Neither will approach OEM heads.  Both
of them know what works most of the time to keep a T4 head together
though.  You get a product that 19 of 20 times is going to see another
75-100k miles.

A local guy usually can only do what a bug head style rebuilder mostly
does.  Flycut em, replace the guides, cut the seats.  If the heads are
in great shape that can be enough for some more miles, particularly
1700 heads have a rep for being rebuilt.  That will cost about $70 a head
from a good place who knows their craft and does good work (around
me at least) then new valves all round will set you back $30 a head
(intakes $5 each, cheaper than grinding em, exhausts $10 each.)  I think
an AVP rebuild with new seats in welded heads is still about $190 from
Bus Depot or direct from AVP, Bob is going to want somewhat more.

Which brings me back to my ever present point of $400 in heads on
a worn out T4 engine is foolishness despite what anyone tells you.
If the barrells are still very nice though and you didn't disturb them
and if it doesn't appear overheated, and ideally if you pull a few lifters
and run your finger over the intake cam lobes and they don't seem
worn, and if the end play was still good, yeah put em on.  This is to
say if the engine was in a Bus and around 125k miles or so.  I know
we got some AMAZINGLY high mile claims on original engines on
this list but putting heads on a 150k or more T4 may just end up
foolishness unless you intend to only drive the thing another 30k
miles or so then sell it to some poor sap.

YMMV
