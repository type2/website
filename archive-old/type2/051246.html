Subject: [T2] WTB: left elbow from heat exchgr to tin

I am having a hard time finding the left (drivers side) elbow that receives 
air from the platic pipes (alternator fan eventualy) above the tin. This 
piece connects the heat exchanger to the pipe above the tin which leads to 
the alternater fan. I have looked at pictures from Haynes, Bently, and ETKA. 
All are different. I believe I have the passenger side which is a elbow with 
a small flat spot in it. Maybe I have them mixed up, I really don't know 
seen as I have never laid eyes on this piece.

So if anyone can help me and my 81 Westy with a picture or part (even 
better) let me know.
