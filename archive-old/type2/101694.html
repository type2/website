Subject: Engine vacuum readings

Hello everyone,
Well I have the fuel injection system installed on my bus but have
not drove it very far yet as I believe I have a vacuum leak.  Right 
now I'm getting a reading of 14.5&quot; on my vacuum gauge at idle.  The 
recommend minimum by Steve Dolan is 15&quot;, and he wrote that he prefers 
a reading of 17&quot;-18&quot;.  I want to increase my vacuum reading but I 
don't know what else to look at.  I'd appreciate some advice on what 
else I can check and also what the normal vacuum reading to be 
expected is?

Here are the details and/or test results on everything I've gone over.

'79 2L engine, compression ratio 7.1:1
'78 fuel injection system and ECU

-Timing set to 7.5 BTDC, dwell at 49 degrees, idle speed 925.
-Spark plug gap is correct (.028 in) bosch super plugs
-Compression test, cold engine (#1 126, #2 128, #3 130, #4 127)
-valves set at 1.5 turns past contact, Hydraulic lifters
-Fuel pressure is within specs at idle.
-All small vacuum hoses replaced, the small 3mm ones.
-I've disconnected all the accessories hoses and plugged them at 
 either the s-boot or air dist box. (aux air valve, decel, 
 crankcase breather, brake booster)
-News seals for fuel injectors, Intake manifold to block gaskets, 
 the four intake runner hoses, and Cold start calve gasket.
-S-boot had two small pinholes and I've repaired them. To test 
 the s-boot I sealed it with duct tape and pressurized it under water 
 with a tire air pump. Only got the pressure up to about 1 psi.
-EGR left in tack and blocked off with gaskets. I've also completely 
 removed the whole EGR valve and blocked the holes in air 
 distribution box, no change in vacuum reading.
-Replaced the small seal around the throttle shaft (old was cracked)
-A new throttle valve hosing to air distribution box seal was installed
-Replaced the distributor points and condenser
-cold start valve is in proper working order
-temp sensor II, within specs
-all cylinders seem to be firing, I pulled each spark plug wire one 
 at a time and noted the rpm drop


Also i've sprayed carb cleaner over every hose, intake manifold, fuel 
injector, etc. to see if I could detect a change in idle.  I did find 
a few leaks doing this and fixed them.  Yesterday I ran the engine at 
2k RPM's for 15 minutes in the driveway to make sure the hydraulic 
lifters were solidly pumped up.  Afterward I checked vacuum at idle 
again and got the same readings.  If some people are getting readings 
as high as 17&quot; or 18&quot; then I figure I must have a vacuum leak.
Please let me know what your suggestions or thoughts are. Thanks
