Subject: Re: [T2] starting and warm up

If you have a good fuel pressure regulator, it will mantain the pressure 
  for virtually forever after the engine has been turned off. This high 
pressure stays constant in the fuel ring that runs around the engine and 
is the reason that fuel injected buses don't suffer from vapor lock.

&gt; This might be the more effective technique. But better in the rain? When 
&gt; it's snowing? In a dark alley at 2:00 am? Better to turn the key a 
&gt; couple of times!
