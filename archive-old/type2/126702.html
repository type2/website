Subject: Re: [T2] Damn!  Rounded over CV Joint Bolt!!!!

5&quot; Vise-Grips.. Accept no substitutes.  Go buy a new pair. Clamp them
on as tight as you can get them and then twist gently. It will work.
BTDT about twenty times.  Never failed.

After you get it loose, thank the VW goddess that it wasn't the wheel
end of a Vanagon halfshaft.

Drilling will work, but it's a PITA.

Pounding in a 1/4&quot; Allen? Might work. Never tried it. Vise-Grips. work.
Don't worry about the pounding harming the joint. You're not pounding
on the joint.

Slotting and using a screwdriver? I don't think so.....

Note: Vise-Grips., not vise-grips. Get the real thing.  If you pay/paid
less than $10 for 'em, you don't have the right tool for the job.

Replace them with triple-square bolts.

&gt; Hi all:
&gt;
&gt; Removing CV bolts today, got over-confident and rounded out one of the
&gt; Allen-head bolts.  Thank goodness it was on the trans side.  Since I'm
&gt; going
&gt; to remove the trans anyway I can just drill out the head of the bolt
&gt; and
&gt; deal with the stub later.  But, I'd kind of like to see if I *can* get
&gt; the
&gt; bolt out properly.
&gt;
&gt; I've seen suggestions to use vice-grips.  Frankly, I've never had much
&gt; success with the vice-grip method and, given how tight these bolts are
&gt; seated, I'm not too optimistic about that method.
&gt;
&gt; I've seen suggestions to use a 1/4&quot; Allen-head socket and pound it
&gt; into the
&gt; rounded-over head of the bolt.  Since I'm going to re-use the CV
&gt; joints, and
&gt; not disassemble them upon removal, I'm a little leery of the &quot;pound it
&gt; in&quot;
&gt; method.
&gt;
&gt; Has anybody tried carefully cutting a &quot;slot&quot; in the head, like the
&gt; slot in a
&gt; screw head, and removing the bolt with an appropriate &quot;screwdriver?&quot;
&gt; (I
&gt; have screwdriver-head sockets, so I can get good leverage on the bolt
&gt; that
&gt; way.)  Just figure it's a logical thing to try, but maybe somebody
&gt; else had
&gt; tried it, and can comment on how it works?
&gt;
&gt; TIA.
