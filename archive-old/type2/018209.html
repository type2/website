My beloved VeeDub is consistently measuring a high CO% at 2500 rpm.  At
idle, the CO% is only 2.05, but it increases as the rpm increases.  Is
this normal?  I was told by my VW mechanic that it should actually go
down as the engine speed increases.  Is this true?  Could this be an
indication of clogged and old fuel injectors?  Any info would be greatly
appreciated.
