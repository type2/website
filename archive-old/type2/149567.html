Subject: RE: [T2] Please LOOK, and tell me what you think.

     My opinion is never ever EVER be in a hurry to buy any vehicle.  That 
applies particularly to vintage air cooled vehicles.  Maybe I'm wrong, but 
from the tone of your post you seem to be in a real hurry to get this (a) 
bus:

&quot;I'm planning on getting it today if the money comes in...&quot;
&quot;and get back to me asap...&quot;

     Haste is a sure fire way to end up regretting your decision.  &quot;Once in 
a lifetime&quot; deals do come along in the VW world.  If we are lucky most VW 
folks will run into one or maybe even two in our entire collecting career.  
If they are that rare, it's unlikely this is one of those (really, it's just 
not an exceptional deal).  In fact, it's unlikely you will run into one in 
the next few months.  What I am saying is you have time, so please relax.  
Do some more research, and pass up the first SEVERAL opportunities you have 
so you can get the very best bus you can.  The more time and money you spend 
in this initial purchase, the more likely you are to have a really great 
experience with the vehicle.

Buying a bus in general (really good):

     Rust is your main enemy.  No other problem is as insidious and 
unforgiving as a rust problem on a vehicle.  Buy the bus with the very least 
rust you can find.  You can buy good used engines and transmissions and have 
them replaced in a weekend or two with minimal hand tools.  Interiors can be 
found and installed.  Glass and rubber are pretty easy.  Rust is just a 
whole different level.
