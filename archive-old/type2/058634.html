Subject: Re: Be honest... How fast?

	Our '70 single cab, stock 1600sp but with hydraulic valves :),
I cruise at 65-70 on level freeways. Thats slower than everyone else.
I've kept up with traffic, 70-80, and once saw 85 on a lark, but since
I haven't installed the oil-temp gauge and heck, its only 55hp, I
keep it on the slow and steady side.
