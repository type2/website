Subject: Re: [T2] pop-up tent replacement

I ordered a canvas for my 78 Westy, and found it significantly shorter
in front than the stock one, so I had to staple the top to the wood
without fulding it over the plastic strip.  I did the bottom first, with
the bead right up to the metal rails, so noone can claim I overlapped
too much somewhere. It still is very snug, with the round &quot;elbow&quot; really
pushing on the fabric.  I mention this because 2 other Westy owners at
Limbo on Long Island had the same problem, needing to staple the top
right to the wood.  Ron, any way of seeing if the canvas can't be
enlarged a bit in height?  
quoth Ron Salmon:
&gt; The aftermarket canvases are a bit of a snug fit, perhaps slightly snugger
&gt; than the original ones (although the manufacturer adamantly insists that
&gt; they are precisely the same size, having been cut from a pattern made from a
&gt; VW canvas). I have not found them to be objectionally snug as long as you
&gt; install them right (don't pull them too taught when stapling in), but I have
&gt; had a few customers comment that it was a bit tighter than they'd have liked
&gt; (out of hundreds sold).-
