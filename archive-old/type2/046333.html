Subject: Re: [T2] Is this happening to you?

 write
&gt;poetry, go shopping in your pajamas, take your kids to the park, go to a
&gt;volkswagen event, make a pot of steamin hot and spicy chili....do what you
&gt;like.... be proud of it.  I'm proud of what I do...and I think it shows.
&gt;Some call me obsessed (read ex-girlfriend) but I think I'm immersed in one
of
&gt;the many different flavors of the world.d

Isaih, it's hard to believe you're only 17.  Sure you're not 71 and just
feeling dyslexic?  You're in for a long, entertaining life.  More (bus)
power to you.
