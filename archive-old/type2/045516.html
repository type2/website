Subject: [T2] filler neck?

We've got the going around left hand turns fuel smell that
I've seen others mention. We think the rubber that connects
where you insert the gas pump to the hose that goes to the
tank is cracked. A call to Bus Depot yielded no results.
Where does one get that part? Are they still available from
the VW folks themselves? If so, what does one call this
part?

Any suggestions appreciated.

Thanks,
