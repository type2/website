Subject: Sensors?? What??

Hey guys,

	I was underneath my Bus Saturday afternoon, and I noticed a series
of sensors on the transmission. I was hoping you guys could help me figure
out what the sensors were.  There were two sensors in particular that I
noticed. BOTH of them were located at the forward most portion of the
transmission. Both sensors had TWO prongs on them. One of the sensors had a
wiring harness hooked up to it, and the other did not. The one closest to
the passenger side was the one that was connected.

What are these?

Thanks,
