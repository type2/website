&gt; Hopefully I won't add fuel to the fire, but... Doktor Tim has many
&gt; times commented to use the proper Bosch plugs in VWs. Terry recently
&gt; mentioned using NGK Platnium. What I find interesting is that in my
&gt; new longblock from Mexico it came with NGK plugs in it. Not platnium,
&gt; just regular ones. Anyone care to comment on vw's apparent switch to
&gt; NGK. At least south of the border.

Mine came with them too.  I have a lot of experience with NGK plugs and
they are very consistent in quality.  The threads are always cut very
well, which is of prime concern with aluminum heads.  I don't have any
problem recommending NGK plugs of the proper heat range in VW engines.
