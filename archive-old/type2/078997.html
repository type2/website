Subject: Re: [T2] '79 FI dual relay


&gt; I've a '79 Westy California model and would like to know what the
&gt; difference in the dual relays is between the Cal model and the Fed
&gt; version. I think that my relay is bad; no current at 88b with the
&gt; ignition in the running position. My relay # is 071 906 059A it has
&gt; thirteen terminals the other model relay has the same # minus the A and
&gt; has eleven terminals. Anybody know what the two additional contacts
&gt; power on the CA version?

On the 75 to 78 and Fed 79, 88b feeds the injecter resister pack. 79 Cal does
not have the resister pack, the resistance is built in to the wiring harness and
ECU. 88b now feeds injecter 1 and 2. The 2 extra pins are 88f which feeds #3
injecter and 88e which feeds #4 injecter.

88b and a and e and f are all the same power. Do you have power at a or e or f?
If yes, you may have a problem with the connecter terminal in b.
