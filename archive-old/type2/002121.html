hi adam

As to precisely where the wires run I've not checked, but if you get under
you will find the wire that comes out of the tank on the right hand side. It
joins into a cluster of wires and then goes forward. There's a pull off
connector I seem to remember. As a test, if you suspect the wires from the
tank forward, all you need to do is to disconnect at the tank connector and
fit a wire direct to the gauge on the dash. If all's OK then start tracing
the interconnecting wires under the bus. If no change, and I rather suspect
this will be the case, then you need to look at the tank sender, and for
your type the  engine it will have to come out first to access the tank, if
you don't want to cut a hole.

Up front on the dash BTW, its easy to pull the instrument panel off to get
to the wires behind - just 4 screws. Sometimes it helps also to take the
steering wheel off too. Prise off the horn button and take a socket to the
centre nut and off it comes.
