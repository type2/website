Subject: Re: Electric Conversions / sagging rear ends

I love it when threads come together.....

I went to David's site on the electric bus he owns, and was reading the
manual, when I came upon a paragraph applicable to the spring plate
adjustment question:

&quot;The VW Type 2 chassis was reinforced to accommodate the higher total
weight of the electric version (3,075 kg (6,779 lb) versus 2,246 kg (4,951
lb)). The standard Type 2 suspension, featuring independent torsion bars
with trailing arms and stabilizer in the front and an independent
double-jointed axle with trailing arms and diagonal links and torsion bars
in the rear, was utilized. However, coil springs were added to the shock
absorbers because of the increased weight; and the inflation pressures of
the 185Rl4 steel-belted radial tires were increased to 3.2 bar (46 psi)
front and 3.75 bar (54 psi) rear. The standard front disc, rear drum brake
system was retained, as was the roller steering system.&quot;

Note the statement that coil-over shockes were used on these vans, and
installed by VW!  So VW must have thought that they could prevent sagging
by using them.  A separate post had stated that the coil over shocks
caused breakage of the mounts, and I would be interested to see if the
mounts were reinforced by the factory.  David, have you got a minute to
take a look?  Are the coil-over shocks still there?  Front and rear?  do
the mount points differ from a stock bus?

Also applicable to the sagging rear end question is the different rear
torsion bars that VW used.  Did you know that the panels and Westies got
heavier-duty torsion bars in the rear than the passenger vans??  My
passenger van was sagging severely, but my Westies have all been quite
level!  Something to consider next time you see a Westy in a junk yard!

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
