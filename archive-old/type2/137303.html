Check with John, at Aircooled_dot_net, he often will split up a set of Type1
pistons to help a customer, perhaps he's willing to do the same for the Type
4 engines.

HTH,

Subject: [T2] New Piston needed - ideas?

 

Hi, I just bought a set of Mahle pistons and cylinders for my 78. However,

the set is missing a piston. Any ideas on where I can pick up a new Mahle 94

mm? I have several used but would like to find a new one.

 

TIA

 

dan
