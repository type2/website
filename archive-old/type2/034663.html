Hi All, 

        During this past weekend the Engine in my beloved bus went kaput. I 
was just wondering in anyone in the Central, PA area had a used one laying 
around? The other question I have is; where is a good place to buy a rebuilt 
engine from? Any and all responses will be greatly welcomed. This couldn't 
have happened at a better time with school starting back up. Thanks for you 
help. 
By the way I have a 1970 Campmobile.
