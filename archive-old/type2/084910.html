Subject: Re: [T2] Rear wheel bearings

Thanks for the offer.

I planned ahead (for a change) and saved both the left and right bearing 
housings and stub axle from a '73 I stripped for parts a few years ago.

I've got parts, just got to do the work.

Definitely agree on doing the work yourself. I HATE paying somebody to do 
what i can do for myself. At my hourly pay it would take several hours to 
pay the going shop rate. In other words my time is cheap!!

Take care.

&gt;I pulled a rear axle apart from my parts bus to send to one of the list

&gt;nuts - it came off in a snap.  See if there's anyone closeby you can borrow
&gt;it from or break down and get it - think about what it would cost you to
&gt;send the bus out and have a mechanic do this job.  I'd loan you mine, but
&gt;for the cost of shipping and a few bucks more you can have one of your own.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Gearing up for a rear wheel bearing job.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Why? B/c my driver's side rear stub axle has about 3/16&quot; or a 1/4&quot; of
&gt; &gt; in/out play.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The axle nut is tight I THINK.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyhow they have never been repacked by me and are of unknown condition at
&gt; &gt; 190K miles so I'll pack them.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I do remember them making a slight hum 3 years ago when I took it off the
&gt; &gt; road (3 years?!?).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe that was the shaft drifting in and out and causing a bit of a hum. I
&gt; &gt; have heard plenty of bad bearings and I won't say it sounds bad, just a
&gt; &gt; enough noise to say they are making a noise.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Has anyone ever considered putting a grease nipple in the stub axle
&gt;housing
&gt; &gt; to give a pump of grease from time to time?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Would it accomplish anything if it wasn't blowing grease?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've done this job on a Beetle before and I am not looking forward to it.
&gt; &gt; First order of business is to find a 46mm socket. Hope it isn't TOO
&gt;expensive.
