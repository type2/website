Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Galley Plug

you need to tap the plug hole to the next size up NPT, and put a hex plug in
there. We sell a hex plug kit to do every plug on the T-4 (or T-1 engine)
for $14.

this is a common problem, and trying to &quot;patch&quot; it with epoxy or JB weld is
a hack job at best.
