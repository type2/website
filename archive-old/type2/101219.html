&lt;&lt; place to find a value for my 70' Kombi? 
nada_dot_com but take it with a grain of salt, its way overpriced IMHO.&gt;&gt;

My 69 Karmann Ghia was recently totalled after being rear-ended.  The 
insurance company would not give me the N.A.D.A. value.  Instead, they 
settled on the value found in the C.P.I (Cars of Particular Interest) Guide 
and sent me a check for that amount.
