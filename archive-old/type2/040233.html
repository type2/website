Is this the origonal tent for the WEsty.  I have a 71 Westy that belonged to
my father and the tent that came with it looked just like that one.  What am
I looking at here.  Please respond.  Is there a source for this tent and how
much is the going price.

&gt; Jaime thanks for the prompt reply.
&gt;
&gt; I did check out Joe Clark's westy tent page from your site
&gt; the picture in http://www.geocities_dot_com/MotorCity/1101/westy2.jpg
&gt; It is exactly my new tent and is slightly different from the one in my
&gt; brochure from 1969. The wind is blowing slightly stronger. But it is the
same
&gt; white bus on the same beach.
&gt; Does anyone want me to scan my westy catalog and put it up on my pages
