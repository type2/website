Subject: Engine Problems after Tune-up Update

Hi,

Thanks a lot to all who have replied to my previous posts. It been very 
helpful.
Here's an update on my problem, and of course couple more questions.
I went this morning and checked valves and readjusted (some of them were 
just a little bit tight).
I checked compression, as per Bentley, and it read around 150psi on all 
four cylinders.
Now, when I removed the spark plugs, the left side ones were ok  but both 
right side ones were
oil fouled. (These were new plugs as of yesterday!) I replace the fouled 
plugs and fired up.
Well, the problem was still there. Hard time starting, uneven idling, no 
power and some backfiring...
According to the manuals I have (Bentley and Haynes) oil on the spark plugs 
is caused either by
worn valve guides or piston rings. Now, if the compression seems right, 
does that mean it's the valve guides?
I guess I'll have to drop the engine and remove the head to correctly 
diagnose the problem.
How hard is to replace the guides, and what special equipment do I need?
Any opinions or advice?

Thanks a lot,

Rogelio
