Chris Mills says:
&gt;And so if they are gone (or going) - what of their lifetime guarantee?


&quot;lifetime guarantee&quot;??  So, I guess it means &quot;their lifetime&quot;??

Reminds me of when I bought a fountain pen, with a lifetime guarantee, from 
MARIO.

The fountain pen stopped writing, and I called Mario, and asked him to honor 
the lifetime guarantee.

Mario did.  He sent over a 'hit man'!!
