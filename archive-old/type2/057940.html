Colorado Listees,

I posted earlier about getting a few people to caravan down to Jerome with
me. However, my post might have been lost to some due to list failure
(thank god it's back!). So I'll ask again. Is anyone coming from/thru
Colorado and onto Jerome? I'm planning on leaving Wednesday the 9th or
Thursday the 10th from Fort Collins, CO. I'll take I-25 to I-70, across the
rockies, and downhill for about 150 miles and on west.

I prefer to break up the driving a little, and plan to stop over in Moab,
UT (on Fed. Hwy. 191 from I-70), camp, and continue on in the morning. Fort
Collins to Moab: 398 miles, about 7 hours of driving.

Continue down Hwy 191 to Hwy 163 (Monument Valley, Navajo Nation), to Hwy
160 in Kayenta, AZ. Hwy 160 to Hwy 89, straigt into Flagstaff, and into
Jerome. Moab to Jerome: 375 miles, about 6.5 hours.

Moab is not necessary, but is a beautiful place to camp (in the Colorado
river canyon), and some of Gods most beautiful country exists between Moab
and Flagstaff. Yes, it's desolate, so if you know your going to break down,
think twice about this. I will have a CB radio with me, and probably a cell
phone. I've learned!

Decided on this route instead of the I-25 to I-40 route, because I can
shave off over 100 miles from my trip. As it is it looks like I'll put on
about 3000 miles on this adventure (thru LA and San Fran). Two less hours
of driving will be wanted!

P-Mail me with you thoughts and plans. Maybe our paths will cross in the
desert, and certainly in Jerome. Look for me in the Flat Four Fetish
section of the Jamboree!!!

Safe Journies!
