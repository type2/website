Subject: Re: [T2] Paint Jobs and Prices.

Terry,

I painted my bus, I should say that I paid to have my bus painted - cost 
$2700.  That is a two tone paint job, minor body work, and clear coat. 
 The guy also put white rhino lining on the roof - due to 60 rust hole 
repairs.   The look is cool.

I got three estimates; two were over $4200 and the third was $2500.  The 
$2500 became $2700 with the addition of the rhino lining.  The paint and 
body guys that I went with said they could give me a $1000 job of a 
$4500 job - you get what you pay for.  Good auto paint, clear coat, and 
activator will cost more than $500 for a two tone paint job.  That's for 
GOOD paint - not the NAPA brand.

Note that is is hard to paint large flat surfaces than smaller curved 
ones.  Large and flat surfaces show the runs, drips, and sags.  It is 
harder to apply the paint uniformly.  I painted my old Toyota Corolla 
with little difficulty.  Tried to spray the roof of my bus while doing 
the body work on it.  I had access to an industrial air system and good 
quality gun, a large indoor area with good lighting, and scaffolding to 
do the job. It was a very difficult task to do a good job.  Right then 
and there I decided to pay for the finishing paint job - and it is worth 
the investment.


Auto body painting is an art.  BUT it all depends on what your budget 
is.  So how much do you want to spend?  Do you have champagne taste and 
a beer budget  :-D ?  Arrive at that number and then talk to you local 
shops and see if you can agree.
