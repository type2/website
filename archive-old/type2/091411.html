Subject: Wiring Problem - Air Cooled Porsche

This is just a shot in the dark.
I've got a 356c 63 Porsche and someone tried to steal it.
They got as far as unplugging the entire ignition switch so I'm sitting
here with no wiring diagram and either a five hour job or a ten minute
job getting the wires replugged.
Any body per chance have the wiring diagram that I need for the ignition
switch ?
If you can scan it and send it in P Mail. it would be very much
appreciated.

Bill M.
