Subject: Push rod tube seals.

The push rod tube seals on my 2litre type4 engine are leaking
badly and need replacing. I have been informed this is an easy
job only taking a few hours, ie rocker assembly off, rods out,
tubes out, new seals, reassemble, reset valve clearances.

I am new to type4 engines as in the UK the 1600 was standard
on all baywindows, and thats what I'm use to.  I would be very
gratefull of any advice, I am sceptical about pulling the tubes
through the cylinder head.

It is a 'CJ' series engine (2litre, twin solex, no hydraulic cam
followers etc), fitted to a 1979 baywindow Viking camper.

Yours gratefully

Mick
