Does anyone here remember the Porsche 917 Laser?  This was Porsche's
endurance racer of the '70s that dominated that venue until it was retired.
In order to make it to the winner's circle that often required a gearbox
that would go the distance.  It wasn't metallurgy that prevented that from
happening, it was lubricant.  Southwest Petroleum Company (SWEPCO) was the
firm that created the gear lube that made that possible.  Not sold in any
retail outlet, but only through high repair facilities, it retails for about
+ACQ-4.95 a pint here in California.  I put it in my bus and have had zero
problems.  It was the unofficial oil for Ferrari in North America even when
Agip was the sponsor of Ferrari Formula 1.  It is the best gear lube I have
ever encountered in 34 years as a professional mechanic.  SWEPCO also makes
a great bearing grease, but I am still a believer in Mobil 1 for the crank
case.
