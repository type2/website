I shoulda posted this in my original message. Scott Trepod ( 
www_dot_net-link_dot_net/~flyboy) says the panels he got from from Alan Shofield 
reproductions through Das Bullis Haus were first class. I ordered mine over 
two years ago, the danger of buying stuff too far in advance. If I were to 
but them today, I'd have gone to the Bus Depot.         Jeff S.

PS Take a look at Scott's '76 Westy- now thats what I'm aiming for!
