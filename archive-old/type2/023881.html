This number identifies the thickness of the each individual gear on the
camshaft gear.  Because these gears, as well as the corresponding gear on
the crankshaft, are all machined within tolerances, they will not all fit
together exactly the same.  To make up for this, the camshaft gear is made
in different sizes.  The &quot;0&quot; is the standard size.  The negative numbers are
slightly thinner gears as the numbers go more negative.  Conversely, the
positive numbers are slightly thicker gears as the numbers go more positive.
The goal is to select the correct cam to correspond to the crankshaft gear.
Unfortunately, this is difficult to do without having several cams of
different sizes available to test.  If the gears are too loose, they will
make noise.  If too tight, it will cause undue stress internally.  We
generally use +1 camshaft.  They have always provided a nice snug fit that
is not too tight.

The gear # you seek is at the edge by the teeth.
It could also be a zero.

Subject: [T2] Questions before buying new cam
&gt;I'm about to buy a new cam for my 78 2000cc engine I'm rebuilding.
&gt;According to Bently and Muir I need to check the inner face of the cam
&gt;gear for pitch radius departure numbers +/- 1,2,3 etc. Having checked
&gt;the gear I have found no such marking. So I looked at the gear on a cam
&gt;from a 75 1800cc engine and found no such number? Does this pitch radius
&gt;marking only apply to type 1 engines? Am I not looking in the right
&gt;place? Help me please! I want to get the right part the first time.
&gt;
&gt;The only number I could find on the 2000cc hydraulic cam gear is 021 109
&gt;111C followed by the VW logo, then 8H. What does the 8H mean? The gear
&gt;is riveted to the cam, can it be removed and installed on a new cam?
