Subject: 72 Disc vs 73 up?????

What's so different from the 72 Front disc brakes, and rear brakes also, that
made them one year only thing?  Are at least the Spindles on a 72, and rear
hub, the same as the 73 and up Bus?  I want disc on the front of my Split and
found a deal on a 72 Bus, $100.  Don't want to use the 72 disc, but if the
spindles are the same I'm going to buy it for the beam and rear hubs.  I have
IRS on the back and someone is making me shock towers to use the 72 beam in
the Split.

Dave
