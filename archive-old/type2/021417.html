Ed:
I wondered this myself many years ago. If you do a little detective work you'll
see a funny little mark on one side of the thick washers. It matches the similar
mark on the cooler where the studs come thru.
So, yes, you are correct. Cooler with the seals (seals musta been what Haynes
was calling washers- damned British language!), thick washers, thin washers,
nuts.

&gt; When installing the oil cooler on a 2.0 liter engine, where do the
&gt; 'thickish' washers go? Under the nuts ... or between the cooler and the
&gt; crankcase?
&gt;
&gt; I could have sworn when I tore it down they were under the nuts - along with
&gt; the thin spring washers. And yet Haynes says - 'don't forget the washers
&gt; between the cooler and case'.
