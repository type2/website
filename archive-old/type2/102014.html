Subject: friday- eurovan opinion wanted

A good friend of mine is looking at a 93 eurovan.
Anyone out there have any information on this year.
It is a weekender ($8,000).
 P-mail me. 
  Bus content. I had that oil on the heater box smell
coming from my heater. No oil on the box(s) or tubes.
HHmm?! Found that the rubber boot that connects the
oil filler tube to the engine had come loose and was
dripping a bit on the muffler.. not enough to see on
the ground and only when going up hill. ;-) Only sign
was smelly heat.
