&gt; Even better than digipics would be a trip to the junkyard.  You should be 
&gt; able to
&gt;  find at least a handfull of bay window busses just sitting there in various
&gt;  stages of undress. 
Not in my junkyards!  I'm lucky to find any busses!
I've been searching for a donor since May of this year!
