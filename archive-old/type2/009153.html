ok if anyone can help me please get back to me as soon as possible.  i need 
to go from new york to ohio tomorrow morning at about 12 noon or so.  (about 
a 6 hour trip) and with a futon and my 200 lb dog.   any way problem is i 
cant get the bus to stay running.  it will sit and idle a little high, 
sometimes for a couple minutes then sometimes for a few seconds.  then it 
will start to slow and then stall.  and everytime i come to a stop it wants 
to stall.  its hard to push all 3 pedals at the same time.  any idea what it 
could be.  my guess is the timing.  but i have messed with it this way and 
that with no luck.  i am really at a loss.  should i risk the drive?  thaks 
in advance.                                                           -doug
