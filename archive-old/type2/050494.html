&gt; George,

&gt; Look at the August 1970 wiring diagram.  54 goes to the brakelight sw.
&gt; thence to the turn signal sw. Not on a relay though... However, DIN is
&gt; pretty specific as to terminal markings.  If it goes to the brake
&gt; light switch in this case, that's where it'll go in ALL cases.

I see a 54f on the em. flasher switch that goes to the turn signal switch
terminal 54st.  Terminal 54 on the em. flasher switch goes to the brake
light switch, but it appears that current is fed from the brake switch to
the emergency switch.  Circuit 54 also goes to the rear bulbs.

Seems as though power goes from the coil hot terminal, through fuse 10 to
the brake light switches.  From there it goes to the emergency flasher
switch and then to the turn signal switch.  From there it goes to the
bulbs and thence to ground.  This makes some sense, since the bulbs are
shared between the brake lights and turn signals.

However, I don't think that this is the case on the '79 model.  IIRC, the
'79 uses a separate bulb for the turn signals, so the flashers don't have
to interrupt the brake light current as they do in the '71.  Either that
terminal isn't used on the '79 or it's the wrong switch for the
application.
