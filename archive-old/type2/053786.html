Subject: broken valve adj. screw: 2nd one in a 2 weeks!

Clac...clac... clac... clac... clac... went  the engine and just like a
couple of weeks ago, I popped the valve covers to find an adjustment screw
snapped in half, right at the nut. The first time it was intake #2, this
time it was exhaust #4.

Just checked the archives but found no mention of broken adjusters. Did I
overtighten the nuts during the last tune-up or are is this a quality
problem?? Wie raetselhaft!
