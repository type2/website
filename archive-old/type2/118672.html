Subject: Broken braking?

Volk-a-maniacs - A big hmmm for y'all.

My '63 Panel Camper-convert has had an issue with pulling to the left
(driver's side) front wheel whenever pressure is applied to the brakes.  I
went through all the brakes this last weekend to make sure the pads were ok,
the mechanisms involved were clean and functional (star adjusters set
properly, brake lines clean from leaks and kinks, everything lubed up), fluids
clean, filled and bled, then upon test driving it worked great.  Stopping on
all 4 tires... yippy.  Then, I drove and broke some more and started to feel
that pull to the driver's front tire again.  Hmmm.  That was Saturday &amp;
Sunday.  Then today, going to work it seems ok again.  ???   I took a little
longer of a drive on the way home from work and the brakes seem ok again until
the end of my trip when I get that pull again.  Hmmm again.  The more I push,
the more likely to lock up the tire I get.  And I have locked it up by hitting
the brakes hard.  Danger!  I do not want to do that going down the highway.

I have this feeling that after some use or after warming up from use, my front
driver's side wheel/brakes grab more than all the others.  Is this something
that anyone else has experienced?  And overcome?

The only thing I can think of is while checking out the brake lines, there was
some cracking of the rubber near the couplers on either end of the rubber
line.  But no evedence of leaking.  It looks really, really, really old, maybe
original.  Anyone think maybe the old line is flexing when I get things heated
up?  Or do the lines ever feel the heat?

Thoughts?

from Portland, OR if anyone would like to honk and wave.
