&gt; &gt;You can't just throw a set of hydro lifters into a solid lifter case,
&gt; &gt;right?  Like, I can't buy a set of brand new hydrolic lifters for a 78

&gt; Check the archives at vw.i405_dot_com.  Basically, you *can* do this if you
&gt; change a few other parts like pushrods.  Karl has been running this
&gt; combination if I'm not mistaken.

Yes, you can run hydraulic lifters on a solid cam. You will need the steel
pushrods and the spacers, wave, and flat washers between the rocker arms.
See the pic in the 68-79 Bentley, section 5, page 62, figure 17-8.

I have 72,000 miles on my 77 Westy engine with no problems.
My daughter has well over 50,000 miles on her 77 Westy also.
