&gt; &gt; I still can't figure out this intermittent miss, one day the bus runs like

&gt; I really doubt this is the issue, but when my 79 started acting up, it
&gt; would miss at a particular load area. close to the same rpms but not
&gt; exactly. As it turns out the afm track was so worn at one location
&gt; that depending on certain conditions it would miss sometimes.

happens at any RPM, any load, any speed, totally random as far as I can
determine.

I had a problem like this once before, took almost 4 months to find it and
it was a broken wire to the coil, looked fine, felt fine but the copper
inside was broken....
  I have looked at the wire but can't find any breaks
