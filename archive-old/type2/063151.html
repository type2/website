VanBondo used to have a bright red Ghia 'vert and drove it during the
business hours (dressed appropriate for a gentleman conducting bidnezz).
Other times I would drive the '57 single primered in a zillion colors and
reflecting misc. spray can &quot;tests&quot; while wearing a nice but worn Summer
straw Resistol and chewing a cheap cigar. (cee-gar) It looked like Dolly
Partons' coat of many colors without the boobs with Chill Wills inside of
it. (If you dont know Chill or Bob Wills~look it up or pretend that you
follow my thought process). =)
Other times in the single, I would wear the Az Bus Club tiedyed shirt and
let my hair down.
It was funny as to how drivers, especially the ladies, rednecks, and hippies
would react. 

* Dressed to kill (top down) in the ghia ? = Yuppish wannabe social climber
young ladies and envious older men with wedding bands driving beat up
American station wagons with Episcopal Family Retreat Weekend stickers would
look.
(I waved at the ladies~even the Episcopals) ;-)
* Single cab with the dipped hat on? = same Yuppish wannabe young ladies,
low riders and hippies would hate it. Rednecks and cowgirls waved =)
(I waved at the ladies)
* Single cab with the tie-dye and messy hair? = Rednecks, cowgirls, same
Yuppish wannabe young ladies, and my mom and dad would hate it. Hippies,
Hippie chicks, biker chicks, go-go dancers, &lt; 8) &gt; and some older folks with
far away looks in their eyes would love it. 
(I waved at everyone, especially the Episcopal go-go dancers) ;-)
* Now I drive an '83 vanagon with an Episcopal Family Retreat Weekend
sticker on it and look for that same old Ghia convert with a far away look
in my eye. Some how, fifteen years and fifteen pounds and a wedding band
later, I don't get the waves from the chicks no more unless they are the
&quot;jail house howdy&quot; type. Maybe it's the cigars... Hmmm, cant quite figure it
out...

I smile and carry on as the same old guy no matter what I drive. Middle age
crazies I guess. (I'm so F.O.S. it's suffocating sometimes) =)

BTW: If Muir described &quot;front is front,&quot; how come he didn't distinguish top
from bottom?
