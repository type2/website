&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I'm renting out Das Über-Kamper this weekend for a film shoot, and the
&gt; director wanted it know if it would be possible to add some oil and get some
&gt; smoke from the exhaust for a shot he has in mind.
&gt;

You could rent a fog machine and REALLY get some smoke!  I own one and it's used
liberally every halloween.  I live on a corner street and one year I accidently
fogged up the intersection (from my front door) so bad that traffic came to a
stand still.  They are not expensive to rent and would provide a much better
stream of smoke than oil in the engine.  And you can start and stop it on
command.  And you won't get cited by the local mounties for a smoking vehicle as
you drive home.

If you lived down here, I'd let you borrow mine.

Scott
