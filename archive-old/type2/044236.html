Subject: [T2] fabricated Hoover Bit

Well, yesterday I spent the better part fabricating my very own Hoover
Bit.  I followed Dale Mueller's drawing in the Nesstek pages.  Thanks
a bunch Dale!  Turned out very well I think.  It would have gone much
quicker if i had a Dremel type tool.  I ended up having to drill a lot
of small holes along the lines I wanted and then breaking it and filing 
down the edges.  Seems to fit well.  Just need to put some sealing foam
rubber and I'm all set.
