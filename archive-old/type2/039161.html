&gt;Just get the Bentley and
&gt;owner's manual for what ever model you acquire and follow instructions as
&gt;best you can. A 412 seems ideal, but they can be few and far between, not
&gt;easy to find a suitable candidate. A T-III in good order is rarely for sale.

This is the best solution. A few months ago my wife's hyundai burned its last
grain of rice and we found out she was pregnant, I went to the VW for sale ads
online and had her look at all the pictures of type III's and occasional type
IV's
and sure enough she found a fastback that she knew she wanted. We drove up to
connecticut and bought it. Now,her main requirement was it had to be an
automatic
and though I didn't like that idea, my one requirement was it had to be
basically
ungored by PO's and relatively factory when I looked at the engine. We settled
on a 1970 fastback, automatic, fuel injected, and it was a great decision.
small,
good for the city, good for a car seat. The downside is learning a new FI
system,
and keeping an extra automatic trans in the closet, but it's better than her
driving
something we have to chuck out or bring to a mechanic. good luck
