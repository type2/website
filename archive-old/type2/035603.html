Wow,
that was quick. Robespierre is going to a good new owner on Saturday afternoon. His last mission this Saturday
morning will be to take me to meet the tow truck to pick up my next project, a 72 deluxe that's been sitting
in a garage for many years, in the non-running category. Once I register it, new york city law gives me
ten days from that date to obtain an inspection sticker, before I start getting $45 tickets every day, followed
by impounding, So Mr. Hineline, appreciate your 60 day extentions!!!! Of course they're much more strict in California
I'm sure. The trade off is that if I can get it running well enough to pull into certain Bronx gas station, I'll get the
sticker.
