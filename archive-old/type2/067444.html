Subject: Ben Pon (was Bus Ancestry...)

I don't know the roots of his thinking, but the bus was the brainchild of
Ben Pon, who you may hear referred to on this list as St. Pon. As I recall,
Pon used available parts to create a utility vehicle for use in the VW
factory. There's a recap on the web (at a Swedish site) along with some cool
photos of the first bus.

Okay, someone serve up that URL before I'm forced to use Yahoo ;) Joe

&gt;OK, it's Friday and I figured maybe nobody would mind if I brought up a
&gt;low-VW-content topic. Besides, after this weeks long philosophical
&gt;questions about the dimples on golf balls, I thought I could be
&gt;forgiven.
&gt;
&gt;Here's my question for you VW historians out there: where did VW come up
&gt;with the idea for the VW transporter? I can't seem to remember seeing
&gt;any vehicles that were anything like it but earlier. Except for...
&gt;
&gt;Buckminster Fuller's dymaxion car. This has become my automotive
&gt;obsession. Back in the early thirties, the guy who gave us the geodesic
&gt;dome designed a car that could carry eight adults, cruise at 140 mph,
&gt;and get 30 miles per gallon. He actually built several working
&gt;prototypes. The dymaxion car looks like a cross between a VW and a DC-3.
&gt;Imagine stretching out a split-window bus into more a teardrop shape.
&gt;The engine was in the back, where it drove a single, large wheel (It was
&gt;a three wheeler.). The rear wheel also was the steering wheel; it could
&gt;actually turn completely sideways, allowing the car to spin in circles
&gt;while the nose stayed in the same place.
&gt;
&gt;I've only seen pictures of the dymaxion car, though there are a few in
&gt;museums around the country. I'm dying to see the interior of one.
&gt;
&gt;The reason I bring this up is because the dymaxion car was totally
&gt;unlike any car that existed at the time. Is it possible that the VW
&gt;engineers were tyring to achieve a slightly more conservative
&gt;interpretation of the dymaxion car? I thought maybe some folks on the
&gt;list might have seen info on VW's inspiration for the transporter.
