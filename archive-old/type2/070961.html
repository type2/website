Subject: distributor needed
Message-ID: &lt;b27a9d76.24781a7e_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Unfortunately I was too late to pick up my needed distributor from a fellow 
list member who had some things up for grabs.

I need really really bad one of these two dizzys...

1-   021,905,205 P

OR

2-  022,905,205 P

Either of these dizzys can have a P or Q suffix  ( P=single vac.  Q=dual 
vac.) , to work correctly on what I have. 

If you have one, I will purchase it or trade for something.
