Subject: Can't increase vacuum

I can't seem to get the vacuum to go any higher.  Right now it's 15-16&quot; or
on special occasions 16-17&quot; depending on some unknown factor (The Herby
factory maybe).

I've replaced a lot of the hoses prior to my earlier tune-up and the only
poor hose (cracked ends) is that large sized one going from the s-boot to
the oil breather.  All the other hoses are tight or fine although I would
like to replace the intake runner hoses because they are simply so old.  All
the brake booster plastic is making a good seal also.

I've sprayed around the hose ends/clamps trying to raise the vacuum and I've
tried listening with a tube my ear to see if I can hear any leaks but I
can't locate any.

I understand that 15-16&quot; is on the low end of acceptable.  Any ideas on what
I might have overlooked?
