&gt; Dave,
&gt; I'm having trouble posting to the Type2 list.  Here's the two 
&gt; questions I've
&gt; tried to send, can you help?
&gt; 
&gt; I've just recently obtained a dwell meter, rpm gauge, and 
&gt; strobe gun (from
&gt; Gunson products), for a more accurate tune up.  Valve 
&gt; clearances done. 
&gt; Plugs cleaned and set.  Points checked and gapped to 0.40mm.  
&gt; I check dwell
&gt; and got a reading of 35 degrees, so to get nearer to the 
&gt; specification of 44
&gt; degrees to 50 degrees, I decrease the gap of the points.  I 
&gt; take it down to
&gt; 0.30mm, maybe 0.35mm and just touch 43 degrees dwell reading. 
&gt;  Worried about
&gt; diminishing gap I set rpm and strobe to 7.5 BTDC.  I also 
&gt; take off vacuum
&gt; pipe on distributor and block pipe that leads to carburettor. 
&gt;  This is all
&gt; done with information from the Haynes manual.  Although she's 
&gt; running fine,
&gt; I would like to ask:
&gt;   (1) Should I decrease the points gap more to get nearer the 
&gt; 50 degree
&gt; dwell.  Would this be acceptable considering the points are 
&gt; specified to be
&gt; 0.40mm?  How far can you go!
&gt; (2) I strobed to 7.5 BTDC because of a sticker on the fan 
&gt; housing reads this
&gt; and shows a picture of the flywheel with the middle of three notches
&gt; arrowed.  I can nor find the specification for my replacement 
&gt; 1600cc engine
&gt; No. AS182290X anywhere.  Is 7.5 BTDC correct?
&gt; (3) The book says &quot;Distributor vacuum hose disconnected from 
&gt; distributor and
&gt; plugged&quot;.  Do you plug both carburettor and distributor or 
&gt; one only?  Which
&gt; one?   
&gt; I'd be most grateful for anyone who can clear these points 
&gt; for me, so that I
&gt; know I've done my best for a tune up.          
&gt; 
&gt;

&gt; Fed up with using the two sissor jacks to lift my bus, I'm 
&gt; looking into
&gt; buying a trolley jack that's in a sale (Les Smith Shop).  
&gt; It's rated 2 ton. 
&gt; My bus handbook says the bus is 2 ton, so I guess it weighs 
&gt; more with the
&gt; camper (Devon) conversation.  Will this jack be safe to work 
&gt; with or do I
&gt; need a higher rating?  Any advice will be much appreciated.
