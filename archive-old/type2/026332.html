&gt; Subject: Jump starting a FI bus

&gt; 
&gt; Question:  Will a jump start on a FI bus fry the
&gt; alternator to the point where the alternator needs
&gt; replacement?
	[...]
	I've heard talk of frying the FI control unit. 
	NOTE: I'm no expert on this, however I have boosted my 
	bus every spring I've owned it, and it is still working fine.
