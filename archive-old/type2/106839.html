&lt;&lt;I always used a 3/8&quot; ratchet wrench with a 3&quot; and a 6&quot; extension to get the
plugs in and out. That way you can use different combinations for each
plug, as they all have different levels of stuff above them. If your lucky
enough to have the overhead access panel, be happy as my '72 left me
wishing that my arms had a spare set of elbows to get the #1 and #3 plugs
out. (my new bus has the hatch...yeehaw!)&gt;&gt;

Universal joints ease this process greatly. You can also buy T-handled spark 
plug wrenches with the u-joint built in. I've never had to contort myself to 
change the plugs on my 72.
