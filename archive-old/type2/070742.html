Subject: EveryBus 2001 in  North Carolina update

Hi

If you are planning on attending EveryBus 2001 this weekend in North 
Carolina the weather looks fantastic! Over the last few days I have 
been updating the carabus list to EB and it looks impressive. There 
are two groups that will consist of 10 or more buses. Buses are 
coming from as far away as Texas, Florida, New Jersey and Canada. I 
was just contacted by a reporter from VW Trends who will be in 
attendance to take pictures and write a story. Things are looking 
good :)

Don't forget the chilli cook-off and side dish cook-off before the 
Saturday night pot luck dinner. When I got home from work tonite, 
Fedex had left a pile of door prizes on my porch. Some folks are 
gonna go home with some cool bus stuff.

I will do one final update of the carabus list before I leave for EB 
in the morning. If you have any questions feel free to ask.
