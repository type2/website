Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0 Update


Don't recall the year of your system, but if it has an idle switch on the
throttle body, check that. Adjustment or replacement of the idle switch
could solve the problem. Early versions were just a cherry switch on top of
the throttle body that you might find at Radio Shack. Later verison were
mounted under the t-body and must be obtained from VW or a German importer.

If the idle switch doesn't tell the ECU you are at idle, is can cause your
symptom. All it takes is an ohm meter to test it, or you could just throw
money at it and hope that's it. Know that whenever you replace any of these
FI sensors/switches/relays/ect., the system must be recalibrated/adjusted
for idle and mixture. Just running lean under new correct signals from a
replaced device could also cause your symptom. This is why it is VERY
important to follow diagnostic steps in order without skipping anything if
you don't want to waste money on unnecessary parts and still have
troubleshooting to do.

I can only advise to go back and complete all the steps skipped thus far
before going further. The problem still could be poor pressure/volume
because that has yet to be verified.

&gt;Hello All,
&gt;
&gt;Here's the update.  
&gt;
&gt;I went and got a temp sensor today, but for the life
&gt;of me, I could not get it to thread into the hole, so
&gt;I did what the doctor suggested and wedged it in under
&gt;some tin.  Now it starts up fine but roars to a high
&gt;idle, lasts for a few seconds, and then wants to
&gt;die....I can keep it going if I get on the throttle
&gt;before it dies.  If I give it a little blip, it roars
&gt;back to life and it would seem like I could do this
&gt;indefinately.  Just can't get it to idle on its own. 
&gt;I have tried adjustments in both directions on the
&gt;idle setting with no change.  I ran out of light today
&gt;(actually just got too tired to keep going) and will
&gt;do more maybe tomorrow.
&gt;
&gt;Baffled in BC.
