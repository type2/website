Subject: Re: [T2] paint jobs

In the US Navy, Painting is a full time job. Prep: knock off all rust and
old paint with chipping hammers, wire brush, paint with zinc chromate
(yellow) primer. Then multipe coats of oil based enamel in various shades of
grey depending on the objects being painted. Both brushes and rollers are
used....never sprayed. It seems to preserve the metal and prevent rust...but
it doesn't look nice and smooth like a car body. But, it could have been wet
sanded and polished to look that way if needed.
