Subject: smelly exhaust

My exhaust stinks. Mostly when I'm idling. It is real rich smelling like it 
has to much gas.
My muffler is pretty messed up too. There is a leak where it connects to the 
heater boxes.
It is a stupid aftermarket header. I backed into a tall curb and one of the 
two crossover pipes that connects the heater boxes to the muffler is dented. 
  It is pretty flattened.  Exhaust can still flow through, but it is 
definitely restricted. It is definitely louder.
Could there be potential problems from driving it like this?  Could this be 
responsible for the smell?
Thanks,
Kyle
