Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Bay Drum Brake Q?

Chris,


&gt;Your situation sounds like the brakes are not adjusted right - the
&gt;shoes. Need to be tighter.

Agreed

&gt;I'd lift the wheels and adjust the shoes until the wheel won't spin
&gt;and then back off the adjusters until the shoes don't rub when you
&gt;spin the wheel or they touch slightly if the drum is out of round
&gt;slightly.

This is exactly how i adjusted them.

&gt;Also did you open the hydraulic system? Have you bled the brakes?

yes, and yes.  I did rebuild the cylinders as well, and bled the
entire system completely.

It's a different set up than Im used to seeing.  There are several of
the &quot;usual&quot; components missing.  Well, maybe not missing, but not
there.  Like the pins that come thru the backing plate and then thru
the brake shoe with the round clip/washer and spring.  There is also
no ebrake adjuster on the stars.

Im pretty good with brake systems, this one is just boggleing me a
bit.  I'm a bit afraid that it may not have been assembled properly
at some point, and I just put it back the way that it was.  Hence the
picture of one installed correctly.

Thanks again,

David.
