Subject: Re: [T2] horsepower question

Is it running on all four cylinders?

Could it be that you recently adjusted or replaced your accelerator cable 
and now the carbs are not being opened completely when you have the gas 
pedal on the floor?

Slipped timing?

Doubt it is a tranny issue unless your engine is screaming in 4th. Doubt 
also it is geared too high, if you had a tranny with a higher ring and 
pinion gear ratio you just wouldn't have power on hills.

I as curious as you are, so keep up updated.

&gt;Ok experts, here's your puzzle:
&gt;A 1973 day camper (no poptop) with recently (professionally) tuned dual 
&gt;carbs, vac advance dizz, 1800cc motor and timed to 7.5 ATDC (like the shop 
&gt;manual says). Runs great, idles fine, revs excellent in the driveway, no 
&gt;wierd sounds or anything. Clutch is good, adjusted well. Bus sat from 1992 
&gt;to 2000, but brakes are loose now and seems to roll without much 
&gt;resistance. It won't go normally. It limps along. Tops out at about 35mph 
&gt;and barely has the oomph to start out from a stop. on a SLIGHT hill, it 
&gt;will not go forward. Am i looking at a tranny issue? Is there any other 
&gt;possibility?
&gt;Help!!
