Subject: Re: [T2] Bad Situation.........anyone help?

Troy:
Maybe this is a senior moment for me... but I am pretty sure there are NO
FI specific wires in the fuse panel (under the dash). And I don't have a
FI bay to look at right now, just an 80 Vanagon.
The ONLY wires that have to do with the engine are the black wire that
goes to the coil, the oil pressure lite, and the alternator light (blue?).

The very best would be if someone could send you a digital pic of the fuse
panel with wires attached.
Or if anyone could just write the colors down in order. The damn current
flow diagram in the Bentley is very little help for fixing re-engineered
(boogered) wiring. I like the diagrams for the 72 and earlier for that,
but very much different than the 78!

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;      This is alot more than I ever planned to ask the
&gt; list but I don't have alot of options.  My families
&gt; Pontiac GrandAm crapped out this morning and the only
&gt; other car we have is my 78 Bay.  Well, its at the shop
&gt; having the fuse panel rewired.  In short, the mechanic
&gt; says he cant figure out 6 wires related to the FI.  I
&gt; bought him the Bentley manual but he still can't
&gt; figure it out.  That or he hasn't taken the time.  I
&gt; am wondering if there is anyone in the
&gt; Asheville/Hickory, North Carolina area that would be
&gt; able to help me.  Maybe with the wires and possibly a
&gt; ride the the mechanics shop in Hudson, NC.  I have run
&gt; out of options and have no way of transportation, so I
&gt; am trying to do anything that I can think of.  You
&gt; have all helped out greatly in the past and I
&gt; appreciate anything that can be offered.
&gt;
&gt; Sincerely
