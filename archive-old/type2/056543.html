Subject: Re: Baja bus trip

&gt; I'm going to be taking my 79 camper on a month-long roadtrip from Oregon
&gt; down to the tip of the Baja California peninsula in October ...what......I'll need...

That's a nice time to be down there, travis. I've taken my buses to Baja each of the last
6 years in late summer. With a little preparation and some common sense, you should have a great time. OTOH, you could lose it all if you're careless. We could talk a lot about this, but here're some basics:

1- Check out your engine and tranny thoroughly before you go. You want to have a solid bus- good compression, good tuneup, good tires, good brakes, not overheating, no funny noises. If you're unconfident about any system, check it out and fix it now.

2- I take all the spare parts I can reasonably carry. But I go to remote places down dirt roads. If you're sticking close to Mex 1, you'll have more backup from passing motorists, the Blue Angels, etc. At the least, spare alternator belt, spare fuel filte

r(s), air filter, fuel line, a solid toolkit, at least one spare tire, stuff to fix a flat with. I carry a spare starter, points (but
you've got the '79 breakerless transmission), a gasket set, duct tape, various glues, and a bunch of other stuff.

3- A shovel, a good jack and a few sturdy boards can really help you if you get stuck in the sand.

4- Some sort of sun awning that can be secured vs. strong wind is really handy in the summer. Probably still really handy in October. Baja sets a new standard for hot and sunny and windy.

5- This one is real important: At least 10 gallons of extra fuel in safe, sturdy fuelcans. Baja PEMEX gas stations can always be out of gass. The one at Catavina is nearly always out of gas. You need to be able to make it to the gas station BEYOND the nex

t gas station. In central Baja with a bus,
that's further than your gas tank alone will probably take you. The old adage is, treat a half empty tank like an empty tank, i.e. fill up at almost any opportunity.

6- Don't drive at night. Just don't do it. And if you have to, go really slowly and really watch it and get off the road as soon as you can. There are lots of occasional road hazards down there and good daytime visibility is crucial to stay out of unmarke

d washouts, unmarked crazy turns, unmarked broken down vehicles parked right on the highway because there's not shoulder to pull off
on, etc.
Every cow in the area seems to head for the roads to loiter once the sun goes down.

7- Gather information. I recommend you spend some time reading things on the Amigos de Baja website. The archives is probably extra useful.

8- Learn / use some spanish. If you don't know any, a phrasebook and dictionary would be real handy. Mexican folks really appreciate it when you at least try to speak their language. And if you speak it at all well, many doors will open for you.

9- Cultivate and always exhibit a good attitude. This is the single most important thing you can bring along. Mexico is filled with friendly, generous, honest, hardworking  people who mostly have it a lot rougher than we do. Treat them with respect and th

ey'll repay you in abundance.

10- Absolutely don't travel with guns, or drugs. There are many checkpoints these days and the laws are very strict. Most of the checkpoints are manned by friendly polite 19 year old soldiers with automatic rifles who will play it perfectly straight with 

you. Just relax, and let 'em see what they want to see. They're looking for guns and drugs. Mostly they seem interested in checking
out and talking about our camping equipment unbtil their chief says, &quot;Thanks. You may go now.&quot;

11- Absolutely get Mexican auto insurance. Comprehensive coverage available for about $7/ day at one of several kiosks near the border on the US side. American auto insurance is generally invalid in Mexico and if you are involved in an accident for any re

ason (even if not your fault) you will probably be arrested without Mexican insurance. If you have it, you are set. I had an accident
down there and the Mexican cops (local and Federales) played it totally straight with me once they saw I was insured.

12- You can fish from the beach without a Mexican fishing permit. You need one to fish from a vessel of any kind. A surfboard counts as a vessel.

13- 5-gallon clear plastic water containers are pretty convenient for taking to purified water stores and getting drinking water.


&gt; Also, anybody out there gonna be (or wannabe) bussing into Baja in early
&gt; October?  I'm always open to caravaning down with fellow VWers -- safety in
&gt; numbers, you know.

Maybe! Maybe. My usual plan is to go for a two weeek surf trip in September, but this year I
have a few things that could push my trip into October. I'll be busy the first week of October, doing my written exams. I might be able to go later in the month. That's a good time for a surftrip. What are your travel interests and goals?

Baja is an amazing place and I love going there. Unfortunately, there have been increasing numbers of armed nightime holdups of US campers in certain northern Baja areas. The kind of stuff that never used to happen. I'm getting leery of camping alone anyw

here from El Rosario north. You might want to stick to more populated areas in northern Baja. Down south and in remote central Baja, I
think it's still pretty safe.

For a taste of the place and some of my bus adventures down there, check my website stories.
