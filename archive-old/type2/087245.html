Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust related problem

Mathew....not enough info...

Carbs?  Original fi?

You say that it coughed and sputtered all the way to the mechanic...so 
*not* running well on the way to the mechanics place?

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello. 
&gt; I've been through the archive but didn't find any notes pertinent to my
&gt; particular situation, so I'm asking for some diagnostic help.  I recently
&gt; bought a '78 transporter, that at the time had a louder than normal exhaust.
&gt; I left the exhaust initially, and did a tune up  - new wires, plugs,
&gt; condensor, points, gapped it and set the timing. When I was done it idled
&gt; fine, ran pretty well, but sounded like a dragster - the exhaust had already
&gt; gotten louder in the two weeks I'd had it. A few days later, I started
&gt; driving it to the mechanics, 8 miles away, to address the exhaust problem.
&gt; The bus was coughing and sputtering until the muffler finally fell off. I
&gt; tied it up, and coughed and sputtered the rest of the way to the mechanic.
&gt; He replaced the heat exchangers (not sure of the make but the sticker says
&gt; they're from Denmark) and said it was all set,  but running rough. I went to
&gt; pick it up, and it would turn over and start up, but wouldn't hold an idle
&gt; for more than 30 seconds and would choke whenever you stepped on the gas.
&gt; You really have to work the gas pedal to keep it running. Driving it was out
&gt; of the question. The mechanic has adopted the position - &quot;I just worked on
&gt; the exhaust, anything else is your problem&quot;, so I don't really have a great
&gt; working relationship with him, though he's supposed to be the local VW
&gt; mechanic.
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts or info is greatly appreciated.
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Mat
