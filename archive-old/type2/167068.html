Subject: Re: [T2] engine oil additive problems coming? ?

Hi Jamie,

I have noticed the same shortage this year... Canadian Tire usually  
only ever has it from Castrol and it's priced at a premium. Walmart  
has castrol 20W50 and also carries it in the Tech2000 house brand  
that is about 25% cheaper.

Is it only the aircooled engines that have flat tappets? The 1.8L  
engine in Colleen's Cabriolet has solid lifters, but I don't know if  
they are considered &quot;flat&quot; or not.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; none of those words are actually mine,, I copied that stuff from other
&gt; websites,, who have done the same.. so ... I guess the point I was  
&gt; getting
&gt; at,,, as I have noticed that my brands of 20W50 have been  
&gt; impossible to get
&gt; over the summer,,  is OIL actually changing,,, and apparently,, not  
&gt; for the
&gt; better with aircooled in mind.
