&gt; On the way home tonight, the Vanagon died.  Symptoms are an inability
&gt; to keep the engine running.  When trying to start, one or two
&gt; cylinders fire intermittently, but it whuffles out.  When it stops
&gt; after trying to start, it sometimes produces a very disturbing
&gt; screeching noise.  The whuffling sounds somewhere between non-closing
&gt; valves, and massive vacuum leak.  It ran fine coming back from lunch.

It sounds to me like it could be fuel, as opposed to ignition problems.
In the morning, look at all the vacuum lines carfully.  Feel along them
and tug at them gently to make sure they're intact and in place.  One
line that's given me problems from time to time (with symptoms _somewhat_
like what you're describing) is the line from the distibutor to the
*front* of the throttle body.  You have to stick your head all the way
to the front of the engine and sight down between the tin and the throttle
body to see where this line attaches.  I've had this one come loose out
on the freeway, with interesting results!
&gt; 
&gt; Right now, it's on the side of the road.  I figure on trying to figure
&gt; out what the deal is tomorrow, when I can see.  Ideas would be
&gt; appreciated, especially since I know nothing about fuel injection (I
&gt; haven't really figured out carburetors yet).
&gt; 

Get the Bosch book on fuel injection ($26 from JCW, or available locally)
or the Clymer manual that covers the '80-'82 Vanagon.  They both explain
your FI pretty clearly.


&gt; *sigh*  Looks like the '66 isn't going to get that new steering gear
&gt; this weekend after all....
&gt; 
Maybe it will, if it's something as simple as a vacuum hose that's fallen
off!  (The Power of Positive Thinking!!!)
