Hi Barry,

ROFL..... That is the BEST anti-theft strategy I have heard in quite  
a while. Even a dedicated car-thief using a tow-truck is going to get  
screwed over with that technique. But if the thief has a flatbed  
you're still doomed.

I'll never forget the sight of my D/S rear wheel passing me by as I  
was driving my Dad's vanagon one night. Not in a million years.


Happy trails,
