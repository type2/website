I'll second the other folks who suggested your problem is crap in the gas 
tank intermittently landing on the outlets and starving your engine for 
fuel. My '78 did this for some time before I got around to pulling the 
gastank and having it cleaned out. I have had no troubles since then. But 
there is an easy and inexpensive stopgap solution as well, as I describe 
below.

Although it may be a major PITA to get the tank out with the engine in, 
it's pretty simple when the engine is out. You might want to weigh the 
trouble of removing the engine against the troubles of pulling tank with 
engine in. 

You should certainly consider the possibilities for trouble if you go fishing
in your gastank full of gas vapors with a metal probe while peering into the
hole where the gas gauge goes (with an electrical light?). Can you imagine
what a bad place that would be to have your face if you touched off those
vapors somehow? Seriously, thoroughly, extremely carefully ventilate your
gastank before you try to do this. And be really really careful. 

It seems to me that something like a surgeon's endoscope would be the tool
you need to go gastank fishing. But FLAPS doesn't carry those. FLAPS does
carry a tool with a pushbutton on one end and a set of little extensible
grabbers on the other end for picking up small parts in tight spaces. Could
be just the thing if you can figure out how to view inside too. 

Consider the following quick and dirty (and effective) fix to get you by
until your next engine rebuilt when you can pull the tank and clean it
properly: 

There are two lines out of the tank on a fuel injected engine, the two ends
of the fuel loop (an out and a return). They are about 3&quot; apart on the bottom
of the tank. The hypothesized problem is that a piece of rubber in your tank
settles over the out hole from time to time. If you insert a metal T-shaped
hose fitting into the fuel lines on each end of the fuel loop just below the
point of attachment to the tank, and connect the two T's (so the whole line
now resembles an H, if you can visualize that), then you make the system more
robust to that piece of rubber in the tank shutting you off. Gas can flow
freely through either fuel line so crap in the gas tank has to land on both
holes simultaneously to shut you down. This repair solved my fuel problems
for about 15,000 miles until my next rebuild. You have to drain the gastank
to do this, so run your bus to almost empty, drain the tank, and have at it.
$15 in parts and (at most) a couple hours of your time will do it. Worked 
great for me.

Your actual mileage may vary. 

Good luck,
