Subject: Re: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size?


&gt;I've  already had my engine fire.
&gt;I have a nice big extinguisher.
&gt;That little toy lasted about a half minute.

I have a large, Halon extinguisher than I found hidden in the warehouse of a 
parts distributor I worked for, and grabbed it up before I departed that 
bizness.  It is about two feet tall(including nozzle), and should be quite 
adequate in case of a fire.  I stash it beneath my front split-bench seat.  
I also have a small, red, Halon charged cylinder beneath the seat.  I prefer 
the halon to chem. for obvious reasons.  It's a shame they pulled them from 
the marketplace.  I guess some dumb kids decided to try huffing them and 
caused a stir.
