&gt; &gt;I've had
&gt; &gt; good luck using a
&gt; &gt; Dremel tool with cutoff disk. 
&gt; 
&gt; I would only go this route as an absolute, last ditch
&gt; effort, and even then, with MUCH trepidation...
&gt; 
&gt; Folks, I *cannot* caution people enough when it comes
&gt; to using these things! The disks are very thin, and
&gt; break *very* easily. They are also designed for hobby
&gt; work, not cutting through that much steel (though they
&gt; will do the job...).

Dremels are remarkably rugged tools for their size.  If you need to remove
a lot of material they are not the thing to use, but they are handy for
light situations such as shaping and slitting.

&gt; That said, I've been using Dremels for close to 20
&gt; years without any problems (I wore out the first one I
&gt; bought;-). But *always* wear wrap-around goggles, if
&gt; not a face-shield.... 
&gt; 
&gt; My new(er) dremel is a variable-speed model (most
&gt; are), and the chuck/bit can travel between 5,000 and
&gt; 30,000 RPM!!! So it doesn't take a genius to see to
&gt; see how a fragment from a broken wheel/bit can cause
&gt; some *serious* damage to the user's eyes and face.

The spindle does turn at high RPM, but the edge speed is no higher than
that of other power tools that use larger diameter tools.  A 7&quot; circular
saw only has to turn 4300RPM to get the same edge speed.  Eye protection
is definitely a good idea for all of these things!

My favorite bit for the dremel is a 1/8 inch round-end carbide burr.  Good
for drilling, deburring, shaping, etc, on just about any material (steel
included).  The carbide bits are hard to find (they're expensive), but
they are well worth the money.  They last just about forever.
