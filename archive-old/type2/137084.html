Subject: CV joint question

I have some new CV joints that I am getting ready to install. I notice 
that they come with a rust preventative coating of some sort. Do I need 
to disassemble these and clean the coating off and reassemble or can I 
just pack them with the enclosed grease and install them as is? I ask 
this because with things like pistons and cylinders it is recommended 
that this coating be washed off before using. The brand name of the CV's 
is GKN/Lobro.

Thanks in advance,
Bill Moon
