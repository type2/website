&gt; Hello Richard,
&gt;
&gt;     To find &quot;O&quot;, or TDC on your pulley you will need a piston stop, and TDC
&gt; marker. I made one from an old spark plug, by breaking out the porcelain and
&gt; welding in a rounded off bolt, but they are available from motor cycle shops
&gt; for a few bucks.

gee why work so hard.  take out the #1 spark plug. check that your dist is
approx #1 now carefully hold an unsharpened pencil in the sparkplug hole
and carefully feel for the top of the piston, then carefully turn the
engine until the pencil is pushed as far out of the sparkplug hole as it
can, hold the pencil so it doesn't get broken but when the pencil is as
far out as it goes, TDC.

Bob
