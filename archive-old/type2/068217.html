Subject: Question on exaust in cab.

        Chip,
BE CAREFUL!! CO can kill you way quick, and it makes you stupid first.
BTW, RMMW sells '72-74 heat exchangers for $250, although I cannot
vouch for quality.

        That said, learn from my dumb mistake about disconecting
heat exchangers. You've got a type IV, yes? With the cute little
electric fan blowing air through two tubes to the heat exchangers?
You won't foul-up the engine cooling if you disconnect one
of the tubes from the blower, BUT, that won't stop fumes
from the heat exchanger from coming forward, even with the
little heater flapper valve closed. 

        If your '74 is like my '70, the left and right heater control 
knobs control left and right flappers, so in theory you can tell which 
heat exchanger is the source of bad smells and VERY DANGEROUS fumes.
HOWEVER, if you disconnect the tube from fan to exchanger, engine
compartment air (not always pretty smelling) can still be drawn
through the system. And the flapper valve is good enough to stop heat,
but not poison. If you decide one exchanger is the problem, and don't
fix it, do yourself a favor and disconnect the flexable pipe from
the flapper valve to the hot-air-pipe on your vehicle and cover the
hole with aluminum foil and duct-tape or something else appropriate.
And watch that other heat exchanger closely- if one fails, reason
suggests the other will too, soon.

        Also, check all the exhaust system connectons for tightness
and good seals- if exhaust is getting into your engine compartment,
that could be the source of smell, and hot exhaust isn't much better
for the engine to breathe than it is for you.

        Happy motoring!
        Bill
