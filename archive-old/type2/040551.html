Subject: CV Joint (Half Shaft)

Hey Guys,

My wife took our 74 VW Westfalia (her daily driver) into Midas today to get
the brakes inspected.  Midas said it needed new rotors on the front brakes,
no big deal.

But they got her really spun up about the &quot;half-shaft.&quot;  The mechanic was
alarmed about the level of play in the shaft.  I checked it and it wasn't
bad according to Muir.  No play forward and backward, plenty of play side to
side.  (You guys will probably remember me asking you questions trying to
figure out a noise, which we all think are the wheel bearings and loose axle
nut).  Anyway, the mechanic went on to say that the cv joints were shot and
that it was grinding knuckles away.  I have no idea what grinding knuckles
away means.  Has anyone ever had to actually replace the large metal axle?
How can I chase this down (I promised her I would consult with the experts
on the list before dismantling our beloved bus)?

I'll probably go ahead and replace the cv joints (about due according to
maintenance schedule).  Does the price quoted for CV Joints usually include
the joint next to the tire and the one at the transaxle per side?  Or am I
looking at buying 4 joints?

While I have the CV Joints apart, would this be an opportune time to go
ahead and replace the wheel bearings?

Really appreciate the help.

Thanks,

Darrin K. Pierce
