&gt;&lt;&lt; I wouldn't want to drive on a long
&gt; trip to anywhere in
&gt; a car that's worth $2000 or $3000. Consider it a
&gt; measurement of risk. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Well, I know a guy that bought a pretty nice looking  '71 bus (me!) for
$50; it had been a storage shed in  po's back yard for 16 years. Al
original.    I rebuilt the upper end for $285 and took it the the Jerome,
Arizona bus jamboree (some 600 miles rt) without any problems.  So now I
have a running bus for less than $500. Should I be afraid to enter the
highway??? Just returned today from a 1-day 400 mile trip to visit my
daughter. In my opinion it is what you know, and how much you know and can
trust about your unit before going on the road!
