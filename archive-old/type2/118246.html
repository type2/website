Subject: New data on my questionable ECU

My vehicle has been in the garage for two months while I troubleshoot 
the FI system. Today,  I've made two small discoveries and I'd 
appreciate comments from  the list gurus.

I'm &quot;fortunate&quot; in that my fuel pump runs when the key is in the ON 
position because the PO modified the wiring at my double relay to 
bypass CR1 because it does not close.

Factoid 1. I made all the normal connections, and pulled the 
injectors from the case so I could view the spray.  I pulled up the 
piece of rubber that shields the two white wires leading to the plug 
on injector #1. I connected a sharp probe to a wire from chassis 
ground and jammed it through the insulation on the wire that should 
ground the injector. As long as I maintained this ground, the four 
injectors sprayed in a fine cone pattern. To me, this says that if 
properly grounded my injectors will fire. Conversely, this implies 
that my ECU is not grounding the injectors.

Factoid 2:  Taking a lead from one of the many T2 posts, I grabbed a 
spare distributor and connected it,  in parallel with my existing 
distributor, to terminal 1 on my coil and to ground. This offered a 
simple way to send a pulse to the ECU without the bother of running 
the starter.  When I turned the dizzy shaft by hand to open and close 
the points, the injectors gave a very brief and temporary blip of 
fuel. Nothing like the continuous cone spray pattern.

Is this convincing proof that the ECU is not supplying a ground to 
the injectors?

Thanks, jack
