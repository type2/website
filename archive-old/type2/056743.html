Hey,

How do I fill the transmission fluid in my type iv pancake engine???!!!

The only plugs I have are the one that the &quot;measuring&quot; stem screws into
(~17mm,VERYlower,left side), and a small ~10mm screw hole on the
right,upper,middle side.

I pulled the small one out, it was about 1.5 inches long, and a metal piece
was butting up to the opening once I took the screw off!!???

HELP!!!

Please respond individually, as I digest the list and will not receive your
response until later.  I am waiting for it anxiously!


Thanks

Casey
