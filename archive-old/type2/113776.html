Subject: Tires bought...

Hi

I just got new tires for &quot;La Vebe&quot; and believe it or not I got them at 
Costco in Everett Massachusetts.

They special ordered them for me: Michelin Agilis 185R14C. They were not 
cheap though, at $111 each
balanced and installed.  In order to balance the tires on my stock '69 rims 
they had to order a special
cone for the balancing machine and they didn't charge extra for that. A 
tire store next to my house also
has the required cone, but wants to charge $25/tire to balance and install 
them (plus the same tires were
$125)... I couldn't find any other &quot;all season&quot; tires in the area with the 
C load rating, and since my previous
tires had 18 years on  the bus, it was imperative that I changed them ASAP. 
Boy am I happy I did!

Well, I just though I let you guy know about the Costco source for the 
tires and balancing in case somebody
in the Boston area needs them.

Regards,

Rogelio
