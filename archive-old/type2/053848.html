Subject: Air shocks?

Anybody out there have any luck with air shocks? I don't have a t-bar 
problem, but I haul an absolutly amazing amount of crap around on a daily 
basis for work.&lt; I do custom marble and tile installation, kitchens, 
bathrooms, mantles etc...&gt; and when I'm fully loaded, it really shows on the 
suspension of my ' 79 bus. I seem to remember that these suckers are rated at 
3/4 ton, but when I get close to that, my suspension is pretty much hitting 
the stops. When I'm unloaded, everything is groovy, no butt droop or 
anything, and I was thinking that maybe air shocks or a good set of coil 
overs would help me out. Anyone ever try this, or am I just stuck with 
keeping my load far below the rating of the bus?
Thanks, 
Jack Merrick
