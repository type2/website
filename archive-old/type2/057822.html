Subject: FS: Solex 32-34 PDSIT-3 Carbs

Have a pair of Solex carbs/manifolds from '74 Westy (pretty sure).
Will forward to best reasonable offer + shipping.  Bus ran 'OK'
with 2 carbs, drove off better with a single Holly/Weber . . .

Also can't find anything in the Archives re: best glue to use for
reattaching Westfalia cabinet veneer.  3M 77 really lets go in the
cold weather--anybody know the good stuff??
