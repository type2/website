Subject: Re: [T2] was Alternator light on, now oil light

My alternator light is fine, but my oil light stays on about a second
after the engine starts.  Why? Is this normal? PO says engine was
rebuilt right before I bought it (74 SC).  I have no reason not to
believe him.  tia, Greg

&gt; I figured I'd weigh in on this one as well.  My alternator light sometimes stays on when I first start my 1979 Westy.
