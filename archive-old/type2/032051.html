Hi all-

   Work progresses fairly well on the 73 as I semi-leisurely get it
running again.  Luckily I have an enthusiastic friend helping me.  He
wants to go to New Orleans for his 21st b-day and I told him we could take
the VW if it was running by then.  *G*  That gives me a couple of months.

ANYWAY, to the point.  Would any of you listees in the Austin TX area let
me know of good shops, junkyards, and other resources in the area?  We
pulled the engine on Monday, and tomorrow we want to get into it.  Thanks
for the recent postings on canvas replacements, mine is tattered and
shredded beyond use.  

TIA and happy driving-

LT
