You said it was stalling when you came to a stop, right? I would put my
money on the valves needing that first adjustment. On a new engine ( or head
job) I always run the engine for a while get it warmed up set timing,
carburetor settings etc.  Let it cool down, until it's cold, and adjust the
valves.  Then I run it for about 50 miles and adjust the valves again.

What kind of dizzy do you have?

&gt;
&gt; Yes, replaced the heads and have not ran the bus for more than 100 miles.
&gt; After 100 I will readjust the timing, valves and dwell.  You don't think
it
&gt; is a bad vacuum advance on the distributor?

&gt; Justin,
&gt; You replaced the heads on this engine, didn't you?
&gt; I would readjust the valves ( they are proly tight, from the seating
process
&gt; in the first few hundred miles),  if you have points check the dwell.
Check
&gt; your carburetor air/ fuel mixture setting, idle setting,  and, replace the
&gt; fuel filter.
&gt;
&gt; As another listee once said:  When something in a Bus doesn't work right
it
&gt; usually isn't just one thing that's wrong.....

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I have had my 71 westy on the road for two weeks after a 10 year
&gt; &gt; hibernation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Question 1: I have noticed that when cold, she will not idle at all.
When
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; am at a stop light she just falls right on her face.  However, when warm
&gt; &gt; (after being ran for about 10 minutes) it idles very healthily.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Question 2:  If I do not REALLY race the engine before I let the clutch
&gt; out,
&gt; &gt; it will want to stall.  It also chugs and acts like it is missing when
&gt; under
&gt; &gt; load.  I usually compensate by downshifting but I think 50 mph in 3rd is
a
&gt; &gt; little hard on the motor.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any suggestions welcome (within the boundaries of good taste : ))
&gt; &gt;
