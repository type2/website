Steve, I was the one that you checked after Doc Ric's.  The typeIV that
had perfect dwell and timing, but had a vacuum leak.  The line that you
gave was definitely tight, like you said.  But, I got one side of
injector seals changed and noticed big difference in the idle quality.
I just ordered another set for the other side, as well as more 7mm fuel
line and new clamps.  Also will be replacing the rubber seal between the
body and engine tin.  Can only imagine how it will be with all the seals
replaced.  Thanks for your diagnosis at EB, you were spot on.  

Oh, question....what was the device that you used to measure the RPM's?
And what were you using to measure the vacuum?  Thanks again.

Troy,

Vist a '68-73 stock westy.  The rear-facing seat had a seat belt settup
and should be safe while driving.  Was your bus #3  that I checked?  The
one that was good?
