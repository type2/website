Subject: Re: Don's CV boots -- let's get serious here

&gt; Okay, Don, here's the deal. I'll pay for the CV boots (Bus Depot, 9.95
&gt; each) if someone else will volunteer to pay for expedited shipping. (It
&gt; might even be a drop ship from a California location).

I actually can afford the boots... But thanks for the offer!

&gt; Do you have the correct drive for the bolts? If not, I will mail you
&gt; mine today and you'll have to mail it back to me.

I'm going to splurge for it since I'll be needing it on the road and
in the future. There's a speciatly tool shop near my house that
actually knew what a &quot;triple square&quot; was. =D

&gt; Do you know whether your bolts can be reused? If not you'll need those
&gt; too. Have you got a place nearby where you can get those?

That I don't know yet, but vwparts_dot_net stocks them.

&lt;Tsunami victim?&gt;
&gt; Maybe I'm being a jerk to insist on all this. If so, you and others can
&gt; tell me.

I appreciate the concern. (H4s were installed when I discovered both
of the sealed beams were horribly dim shortly after purchasing the
bus. The difference in price was like $25 between the H4 kits and
quality sealed beams... I figured the improved visibility was worth
the money.)

I was hoping to replace the entire CV joint. That's what I can't do
until after I get to Denver. Boots are cheap. I still have a couple
hundred to work with this weekend, and I already have most of the
brake parts I need. But I *DO* need to get tires and fix the exhaust.

My joints have always been bootless (since I got the bus). It was one
of those &quot;I'll get aroundtoit&quot; things since I was just driving back
and forth to work. They never made noise or anything, so I kept
forgetting about them.

CV test results: Rotational slop: less than 10 degrees. Lateral slop:
a buttload! I have no idea if that's normal, but it really made me
wonder when I checked them last night.

I'm going to pick up &quot;real&quot; boots tonight. I can buy tune-up stuff
(points and condensor) on the way out of town. Plus I have a spare 009
fully loaded. $20 is cheaper than the $60+ for a Pertronix type
system. I still need brake lines (mine are cracking) and exhaust studs
and helicoil/inserts.

I may hold off on tires until I leave too. That doesn't make me happy
though... We'll see...
