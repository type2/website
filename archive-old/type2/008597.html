I am going to replace my canvas and was thinking I would go with PLF-Dawn
Smith,  - Has anyone used or seen her product?  I know Fred in WA likes
her stuff.  Also, any tips on canvas replacement appreciated or other
suppliers appreciated.  

I just want to thanks to all on the list and the powers that be that keep
it going - I joined with #1 in 99 and the help as I rebuild my motor has
been fantastic - THANKS

John Reynolds - Mass.
81 Westy -
