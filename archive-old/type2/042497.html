This topic was huge;y discussed and done on the 914 list I belong to.
Unfortunately, I have minimal electrical knowledge and just passed the topic
by.
You can check the archives of rennlist_dot_org or rennlist_dot_net (not sure which
one has the archives) and even join the 914 list and ask.
Great list as well.


Thanks!

&gt;
&gt; Hello,
&gt; I was curious if anyone has ever tried intercepting the output of the
&gt; AFM with a POT and then adjusting the fuel mixture that way.  Any
&gt; reasons why it would or wouldn't work would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Mike
