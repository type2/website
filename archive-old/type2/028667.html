Subject: Bracket for fuse block on '72

In the span of 29 years since my bus rolled off the production line, there
have been many modifications (mostly detrimental) made to my '72 by its
previous owners.  The one that is causing me the most worry is the complete
lack of any mounting bracket for the fuse block.  The entire fuse assembly
is hanging from a string tied around the steering column.  While there is no
apparent immediate danger of grounding or shorting against any nearby metal,
I know this is not right and want to fix it as soon as possible.  This
should be the last of my interior work before the bus becomes a daily
driver.  I have searched the archives a bit to try to find a picture of the
original mounting bracket and location, but can't find any info.  Can this
part be purchased, or should I try to fabricate my own?  Donor busses are
very rare in my area (seacoast of NH).  If anybody knows where I can find a
good photo for fabrication purposes, or can steer me to the right part, I
would be very appreciative.

Thanks in advance,
Jay Brown
