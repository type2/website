&gt; Volks,
&gt; I an having a problem keeping my CV joint bolts staying onto my 69
bus. 
&gt; I thought of lock tighting them in any ideas?

I'm not a fan of loctite, since stuck bolts are not my idea of a good
time!

The CV bolts should go through some one-way washers (they have a
texture on their working faces that increase friction in the
counterclockwise direction) and then through plates that spread the
load on the boot flange.

The washers and plates work together to keep the bolts tight.  If any
of yours are missing, then you should scrounge them back up.

If your loosening problem persists, then you can drill the bolts for
safety wire.  A bit of a hassle, but it's positive and the bolts will
still come out OK.
