&gt; We are unsure where we will go after NYC, but we have
&gt; five or six weeks to travel about.

wander down the coast and see Philadelphia, Baltimore, and your nation's
capital.

&gt; I am asking anyone on the list in the NYC area to
&gt; offer any suggestions or advice (or maybe a place to
&gt; park for a night) on getting around the city. We plan
&gt; on going to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island and
&gt; since I have never been to NYC, I have no idea what to
&gt; expect.

never take a car/van or any other private vehicle into Manhattan unless
you already own a parking space.
  depending on which way you are coming I would find a convienent commuter
train station and park there and take the train into NYC then use the
subway to go whereever you wish to go...just an example I did a few years
ago.   Central Park to World Trade Center driving, 1hr,35minutes.  return
on the subway,  17 minutes!  midday not rush hour!
