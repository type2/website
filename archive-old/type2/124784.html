Subject: Re: [T2]strange sensor

Is this 'sensor' mounted at the inner edge of the tin near the center by the case split seam?

If yes, maybe someone lost the one 10mm screw that holds the tin down?  All the other tin screws are 6 x 1.0
except 2 under the heads and the one 10mm screw..... Maybe they put a phoney sensor in as a screw.

Does the temp sensorII have the two connections? I
did find 2 wires unhooked on my FI harness but they
 would not reach the sensor. Plus, my 78 does not have
this sensor and I did not know there was a difference
between the 2 model years.
