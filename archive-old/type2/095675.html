Subject: Sweet Pea Rides Again!

Hi Folks,

After a month of sitting and saving, and a few hours of labor,  Sweet Pea is 
running again with a new alternator!  I got a rebuilt alternator from The 
Bus Depot, and was pleasantly surprised at how (relatively) easy a job it 
was.

Now I can start saving for an external oil cooler...

Take care all,

Jason Upper
