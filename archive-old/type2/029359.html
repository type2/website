Ive tried quite a few methods of hanging the tranny and the chain is by
far the easiest. get about a 10' length of chain and 2 of those S shaped
clips. loop chain over that convenient gap in the frame members and clip
it in place. its all good. and if you want to jack the tranny later to
help installing the engine you can do it w chain in place.
