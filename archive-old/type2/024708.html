&lt;&lt;...Most of the stuff is from China and I wouldn't buy anything 
that requires great strength (Chinese steel).....&gt;&gt;

I have a Harbor Freight a couple of miles from me that I frequent.
Radar is correct in that most of the products are Asian in origin
and you really need to inspect before buying.  If you are careful
about your selection and wait for it to come on sale (they always
have something on 'sale') then you can usually get a tool that
will do what you need it to for a very cheap price.
