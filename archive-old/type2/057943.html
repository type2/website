&gt;anyway the point of my correspondence. you dudes need to look at the front
&gt;beam where the steering swing arm is welded to it. looked at mine, found a
&gt;crack. looked closer (wire brush etc) and its cracked from one side to the
&gt;other. in time it would have snapped off and i would have had no steering.
&gt;has anyone else come across this? its a 72 westy.

Sadly, yes.  Our last westy had the steering arm / beam joint completely
separate with no warning whatsoever.  This resulted in a complete inability
to steer the bus.  Please, please, do not even think of driving your bus to
Jerome with a separating joint.  Ours failed as we were pulling out of a
parking space.  The previous day we were driving down steep twisty mountain
roads with my wife beside me and my (then 3 month old) son in back.  I
don't even think about what could have happened if the beam had separated a
day earlier.

You gotta replace the beam, man.  Josh has a write-up on how to do this on
his tech page (there are links to it of the Type2 site).  Time is tight,
but if you can locate a good beam, and enlist a friend or two, you can do
it by Sunday.

Please don't drive your bus until it's fixed.  It's very, very frightening
when the wheels suddenly totally ignore anything you do with the steering
wheel.  When ours went, we had *no* warning at all, just &quot;PONG!&quot; and I
might as well have been sitting in my living room holding a steering wheel
for all it did helping steer the bus.  That fast; that out of control.

Also, resist the urge to reweld the joint.  It's illegal for starters (in
Canada, at least), and it's illegal for good reason.  Beams aren't
outrageously expensive in the grand scheme of things.  You may luck out and
be able to pull one complete with ball joints etc from a wrecker and make
quick work of it.

Let all us list folk know how it goes.  Good luck in getting this fixed
quick.  I wish I could get to Jerome this year.

Stay safe!

Tobin
