Subject: Re- disc brakes?

&gt; I've thought about this for my ghis. The major requirement is for 
&gt; emergency brakes. Some sort of arrangement would have to be installed.

Bill and others,
That's a good point.  On cars with rear disc brakes (more and more of
those nowadays) how do they do the emergency brake?  Always been curious
about that one.

The rear disk rotors on my car are shaped somewhat like one of those &quot;straw&quot;
hats that seem to reappear every 4 years for political campaigns or on &quot;old
time&quot; stage shows (w/cane).  Flipped on it's side, the flat &quot;brim&quot; is the
usual surface for the caliper/pads to grip. The inside of the raised portion
forms a small drum, and a conventionally shaped set of drum brakes (smaller
than in a standard applicaiton) fits inside to form a manually (cable)
actuated parking/emergency brake mechanism.
