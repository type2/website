Thanks all for being here!  I just inherited my grandpa's '70 VW ASI/Riviera 
pop-top (even found the side tent) and no doubt will be having many 
questions.  It was comforting to read Karen's note because it was good to 
see there was someone else out there who is in the same boat as I am, in 
terms of not knowing every part of her bus like the back of her hand!  I 
wish I could help you, Karen - it appears you've come to the right place.  
I'll likewise try to look into libraries and such, before bothering the 
crowds.

Marya of Portland
