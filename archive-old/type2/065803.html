Subject: Re: valve cover &amp; pushrod tube leaks

The '82 van I recently purchased had just has the engine professionally rebuilt before I 
purchased it. I was sure amazed to see what an air cooled engine looked like without oil caked 
all over it! ( I used to own a '73 and a '79 transporter ) One of the heat exchangers is being 
leaked on by either oil from the pushrods or the valve cover. You probably know what this 
smells like when I turn on the heat! Can anyone give me any tips on dealing with this. I just 
bougt a set of valve cover gaskets and I'm going to start by replacing these. Should I apply a 
sealer or adhesive on the gasket? Just some oil?
