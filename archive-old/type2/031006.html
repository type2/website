&gt; Bob must be a flatlander!  You'll miss the beauty of the west if you avoid

yes I am a flatlander, BUT I ski so I know the backroads and hills.  was
out that way just this past December skiing at Snowmass drove over
Loveland Pass, and 2 years before I was down in Crested Butte, I love the
mountains  BUT and it is a big BUT, I know my vehicle in this case he is
going down to pick up a westy.  

this is a vehicle he has not even seen much less driven, I would hardly
reccomend stressing this bus in the mountains.  does he know what shape
the brakes are in even.


&gt; the hills.   I don't know where you're coming from but if you exit I-40 at
&gt; US 84 just past Santa Rosa in New Mexico and go up US 84 to I 25 to Santa
&gt; Fe and beyond to Taos then back to 84 to Pagosa Springs you'll miss any
&gt; high passes and have a pretty ride to Durango (there is a little pass
&gt; around Chromo).

I'm also train buff and have followed many of the routes of the Denver and
Rio Grande Western from Alamosa to Durango and then up to Silverton so I
know those old back roads, and your right it is beautiful.

&gt; Lifes an adventure and you'll miss it on the freeway!

for sure, I once took two weeks to drive across the country on secondary
roads, one way and this was my vacation,  love getting off the main road.

but if I'm having trouble with my bus I'm sticking to the interstates
