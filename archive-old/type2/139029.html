&gt; 4) Paint / Rust - The paint job on this car is.. OK. It looks REALLY good, but
&gt; it was a pretty cheap paint job.

Looks like they painted your 73 the 68-70 style of just painting the roof
white.

&gt; I noticed that in the corners, the paint is
&gt; starting to rust. This is the sill panel directly under the door in the wheel
&gt; well.
&gt; See: http://community.webshots_dot_com/photo/70738428/234409959PVfxjl
&gt; What can I do to prevent this from getting any worse? Do I have to get the
&gt; entire car repainted?

No. Just sand it down to remove the rust and touch it up yourself.

&gt; Also, if you look under the body of my car, it seems that the car is really
&gt; really nasty. The entire underbody of the car seems to be rusted, but when I
&gt; take a close look, it's just really nasty undercoating. The inside of the bus
&gt; is totally rust free except the roof panel where headliner had apparently been
&gt; glued to. Is there anything I can do to this undercoating? Should I just leave
&gt; it? Can I paint over it? Just looking for ideas:
&gt; See: http://community.webshots_dot_com/photo/70738428/234410021oPUvIx

Leave it.
  
&gt; 5) And my last and final question... I think I asked this before, but no one
&gt; knew the answer.. maybe that's changed! :) I decided to redo my engine
&gt; compartment because apparently the PO had removed the spring and one of teh
&gt; air flap. When I removed the alternator and everything, the wiring was
&gt; apparently soo brittle that it just fell apart in my hand. It appears as
&gt; though it's been butchered and hacked to pieces at every point from the master
&gt; fuse block all the way to the engine compartment.

Are the wire brittle or the terminals? I've never seen brittle wiring...you
can replace all of the terminals with the right terminals and crimper.

&gt; Does anyone know where I can
&gt; get the ENTIRE wiring harness for my VW Bus?
&gt; Everything from the engine
&gt; compartment to the inside?

They are not made.

&gt; The gauge wiring seems to be &quot;ok&quot;. But I'd really
&gt; like to get all the other stuff replaced. Or.. if there's a complete kit, I
&gt; would buy that too....
 
Can you be specific about what's brittle to the touch?

&gt; Oh, and my fuel lines are ok, I replaced them a while ago.

Smart.
