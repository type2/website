&gt;Thanks for the quick replies everyone!!
 Bentley just says to put 2 shims in, 
&gt;measure, and then add an appropriate 3rd shim to bring it within spec.  
&gt;Shims are available in .0134&quot; and .0126&quot; so two of my shims are only 
&gt;worn .0001&quot; each.  
&gt;
&gt;This still leaves my end play out of spec, I think.  I wish I knew what 
&gt;the shimless end play tolerances were.

You don't need to know the shimless end play. Follow Bentley, but consider,
you know your end play with the three existing shims, you know your shim
sizes. You now have all you need to calculate the adjustment. And you only
need to get one shim of proper size to use with two of your existing shims
to make the adjustment.

&gt;
&gt;So, if I put in 3 shims of .0142 (.36mm) that would bring my shimmed end 
&gt;play to .0041.  That is in the dead center of the Bentley spec.  I think 
&gt;that is the route that I will go.  3 bucks for 3 shims which could mean 
&gt;another 10-20K or more (depending on how I drive it) out of this engine, 
&gt;why not?

Sounds spec to me. Since you are only a little out of spec, I doubt if you
have much abnormal wear. Reshimming now does seem reasonable and of good
value. It's a bit more work, but if you pulled a head and a cylinder, you
could measure the piston/cylinder wear and look inside and inspect the cam
lobes for wear. If they look decent, this would add much confidence in my
mind as to remaining servicability. Rule of thumb, when a motor is reaching
limits of wear, the cam lobes will show it first as scouring and/or
pitting. Now if you had a bore scope, you could go in through the breather
passage and look over those cam lobes without further disassembly. Maybe
you could rent one????
