Subject: Re: Type 1 engine oil pump removal

Snoopy:
The type1 pump isn't that hard to take out.  All you need is a 'U'
shaped block and a 'T' shaped piece that's threaded where it goes
through.  A puller is available (got mine from Glenda (RIP).  It helps
to loosen the case bolts a bit because the oil pump is such a tight fit.

Some people loosen the case nuts and pry with a screwdriver.  I tried
that once, long ago.  Broke the pump.

A simple tool cam be makde that illustrates this:
