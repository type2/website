&gt; vertically-split crankcases in motorcycles (perhaps harder to keep

Something suspiciously like Hylomar was oozing out of the case split of my
brand-new Mexican engines.  No leaks in several years of use.

I love the stuff, but it is hard to find here in the US ever since
Permatex stopped carrying it.
