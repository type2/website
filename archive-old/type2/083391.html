bald statements? No I only have a hairry statement :)

While this is on a T1 engine in a beetle, when I pulled it a few
months ago the cam plug was completely sealed w/ sealant of some sort.
It appears to have completely stopped the leaking that was apparently
going on before this &quot;repair&quot;. I would say for a temporary fix it
works, but you would always have that nagging feeling in your brain
that you have to fix it correctly in the future.

&gt; Now that I have made those bald statements, I want to ask the list... has
&gt; anyone ever put the plug back in with goop?  or tapped that hole and put a
&gt; plug in?  This is a problem I have never faced, myself.  I have read of it
&gt; and I have seen that plug often enough, but I have never had a problem
&gt; with it.
