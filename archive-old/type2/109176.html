From: &quot;Casting Fool&quot; &lt;jester_at_cfnson_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Thanks, David.  I didn't really want to get the Yokohama Y356's...

Cy (ext. 622) from Tire Rack just called me back with the info that the
Y370's are indeed NLA.  He also said that the Y356's are OOS and not
expected until the end of June (or later).

I really want an M&amp;S tread pattern, so I guess that I just keep on
lookin'...
