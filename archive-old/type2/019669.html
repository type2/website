I have found some of the nuts and washers will interchange between the Type 1
and Type 4 engines.  Distributors and spark plug to tin seals, also.

I just installed a 1979 2.0L Type 4 in a 69 Type 1 Transmission a guy is putting
in a trike.  The 210 and 215 MM clutch, flywheel, and pressure plate work.
Without modification, the 228 MM clutch package will only fit in the later (76
and newer, I think) Type 2 transaxle.

Both ways a swap is done will require a bit of detailing and fabrication to seal
the engine compartment properly.

&gt; Anyway, what is the situation pertaining to parts exchangeability between
&gt; the Type! and TypeIV engines? Are they fully compatible? Partly compatible?
&gt; Completely different in every aspect?
&gt;
&gt; And how about engine/transmission exchangeability? Can you swap out
&gt; engines/transmissions without altering engine compartments etc.?
