Subject: Overhead Consoles

So, there I am faced with a dead overhead console (EVIC/OTIS) for
my '00 Je_at_p WJ, checking out Eb_at_y, when it occurs to me...

Wow!  Wouldn't an overhead console with the nice pushy-button
maplights and perhaps a storage compartment for sunglasses,
garage door opener, etc look REALLY NIFTY in the ol' 78 Westy?
And there seems to be some pretty fair prices on neat units, like
the one from a P_at_thfinder!

Which brings me here.  Has anyone done this?  Seems to me to be a
reasonably cheap/relatively simple modification.  Hmmm.  I'm no
double-E, but maybe even the nicer units with outside-temp
displays and such could be wired into a head or oil temp
sensor... hmmm.  Thoughts, anyone?
