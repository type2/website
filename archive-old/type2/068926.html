Subject: Starting Problems

I have a problem with my bus starting. It won't. The battery is great.
Headlights come on bright and I can push start it it it will recharge good
and drive well. But it won't start, and I don't feel like push starting it
everytime I need to fo somewhere. I am an avid fan of the Muir family and
tried his solenoid bypass on page 446(25th Anniversary Ed). This did not
work. The lights come on saying that the ignition is on but when switched
to start does not even click to engage starter. Do I need a new starter or
is there another way besides crawling under the engine and triggering it
with my screwdriver.

TIA
