&lt;&lt; does anyone have a lead on a synchronizer for synching up dual carbs... 
they usually run around 20 bucks from what i have heard at the local flaps 
stores but ever where i check around my area and beyond says whats that ?
OMG anyways.... if someone could point me in the right direction....?
i have also heard of people making them and such but being that i dont have 
an idea what the heck i am doing i would prefer to have a genuine synch tool so 
that i can get use to how to use it?
thanks abunch

It's called a Uni-Syn...If you can't find it under that name locally,
try Googlin' Victoria-British or Moss Motors or anybody with an
LBC (Little British Car... ;-)
