&gt; I say: Do it.  Save yourself, what? $200 over what a

Amen!  Not to mention you *care* more than most mechanics!   There isn't
anything technically difficult involved, just tedious work.

&gt; First, The drums are probably seized onto the hub.
&gt; Mine, on one side was.  My solution?  I put stands on
&gt; all four corners, with the wheels off, then I squirted
&gt; penetrating fluid on the lugs, around where the axle
&gt; assembly comes through the drums, and the 8 mm bolts
&gt; that hold the drum to the hub.  Then I went to feed
&gt; the horse and check on the new baby goats.  Came back
&gt; and one side was still seized.  Contemplated taking
&gt; the axle nut off, then I got the idea of heating and
&gt; expansion.  Got the torch out, heated then drum,
&gt; sprayed it with penetrant to cool it down, then heated
&gt; it again.  Worked it off eventually by tapping it all
&gt; around with a hammer.

Good idea!  I have the sockets and not a torch, so I go for the hub nut
first thing, but heat is your friend in these situations, and the drums
are built to take it as long as you apply it evenly.

&gt; At this point in time, I had to replace a wheel
&gt; cylinder, only one, as I did not get the advice to do
&gt; the other at the same time before I did this job.

Make plans to do the other side real soon, as I will bet on it
starting to leak.  That was my experience.

&gt; easy too.  Put it all back together and I found out
&gt; that one needs to bring the adjusters out, while the
&gt; drums are off, until the drums just barely go on.  Ask
&gt; me how I know.

Hmmm.... I tend to back the adjusters all the way in, put the drum on, and
then adjust them back out.  You have to do some adjusting, no matter what,
and it is just easier to get the drum on with the adjusters all the way
in.

&gt; I did the front next and that was an amazingly easy
&gt; task.

I know!  Ain't it tho!  99% of the time, I can do new pads on good
calipers in &lt;20 minutes!

&gt; After getting the old pins out, I had to push the
&gt; pistons in, alot.  I must have used all 200 lbs of me
&gt; behind a 12&quot; bar, for 5 minutes each piston to get
&gt; them in enough to have space for the new pads.

Mark, this is a sure sign that the flex lines in the front are swelled
shut on the inside.  the pistons should go back in with only moderate
pressure.  If they take excess pressure, it is because there is a blockage
in the line.  The MC will apply tons of pressure and will blow fluid past
them to appply the brakes, but the return is slower and those blocked
lines will eat your new pads!

BTW, a Vice-Grip 12LC pliers will make pushing the piston back in an
easier task.  Forgot to mention that in the original post.

&gt; Got it all together and it brakes very well now.  One
&gt; thing I did find out, this morning, is that the
&gt; reservoir likes to be FULL.  Otherwise, it acts like a
&gt; bad master cylinder.  Push the brake, stops, a sec
&gt; later goes down a little more.  After filling the
&gt; reservoir FULL, no more of this.

Mark, again I believe this is a symptom of blocked flex lines, tho your
attribution to a topped-up resevoir is interesting.  That should not make
a difference, but if it did, it did.  I have had this symptom and
replacing flex lines cured it.  Next time I experience it, I will check
the resevoir as well

&gt; I hope that my narrative will help other Bus owners to
&gt; do this job, as it is not out of most people's
&gt; mechanical abilities.

Good job!  Good to have a report from *recent* experience.  I've done a
lot of brake jobs, but that is over many years and I average 6 months to a
year between them, so the memories are not always fresh.

&gt; It is just tedious, frustrating, and you will end up swearing.

Yah, I strongly agree...  the swearing is a mandatory part of the job,
unless you are enough of a saint to merit divine intervention  :-)

&gt; Nevertheless, I still did the whole bit in 4 hours and saved my self
&gt; $200 or more in labour.

Which is about right... most shops charge $50+/hr for labor.
