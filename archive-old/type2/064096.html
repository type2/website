So I wrote:

This drove me nuts before I found it. John Muir's description had me
lying upside down studying the backside of the speedometer, but
it's really about 2 feet down the speedometer cable, on a little
box behind the front kick panel. Gently manhandle the kick panel out
and you'll see the button prominently on a small box attached to
the speeddometer cable. Push it and relax for another 20,000 miles
(or is it 15,000?).

Drive safely,
