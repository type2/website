Subject: 'Bump' starting

Mr. Casting Fool mentioned that his '77 bay started to be a bit high strung 
re: starting.

I have discovered that by pushing, or starting to coast on a slight grade, I 
can easily catch my '78 FI stick Westy in gear and get it started that way. 
First gear or reverse.


When I had that idiosyncrasy in my '78, I would park where the bay could be 
pushed, or coasted.

Even on a relatively flat parking lot, I was able to find one helpful 
sole/soul to give the VW a slight push.  Just 3-5 feet is more than 
adequate.

In fact, one section of my office's  parking lot has enough of a grade that 
I can push the VW, jump in and catch it in gear.  And the  if I don't catch 
it the first time, there is enough distance remaining on the blacktop that I 
can try a second time.

After a second failure, as I get closer to the edge of the parking lot where 
the steep grassy embankment starts, I wait and search for the late night 
worker/volunteer who can provide the extra needed effort.


This works on both the 'hot start' problem and the 'left the lights/radio 
on' problem.


WARNING!!!  Please DO NOT allow someone to push the VW directly from the 
front or the rear.  They should always push from a slight angle, and 
hopefully from either front corner or the left rear corner.

Because, when you let the clutch out, the VW will jerk abruptly, and this 
tends to shock the sole/soul's hands and wrists of they are pushing straight 
on.  In a sufficient grade, and with sufficient speed being attained (escape 
velocity??), I always call out 'stop pushing' or 'let go!!' or the one that 
never fails to get their attention 'RUN FOR YOU LIFE!!'



And never toot your horn in appreciation as you drive off.  This is 
considered an insult in many cultures.  No, not the tooting of the horn, but 
the driving off  . . .  as the sole/soul stands in the middle of a dark 
parking lot, some 200 feet from their own vehicle as you go merrily on your 
way home .


PS.  I did solve my 'hot start' problem and my 'left lights on' problem.  
Mike, are you interested??
