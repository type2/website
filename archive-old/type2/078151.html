Subject: Re: [T2] knocking noise in front axle

Check your shock on the side that is making the noise.  My first guess is that
the top bolt that holds the shock is loose.

&gt; Hello Volks,

&gt; My 71 Westy makes knocking noise in front axle when going over even a small
&gt; bump...I can also hear the sound occasionally when not going over bumps. The
&gt; noise is small, not *clunk* sound. I am new to bus and looked at the axle
&gt; diagram and there are two tie-rods and a sterring damper and steering
&gt; knuckle. I noticed a small leak on the steering damper. I am also thinking
&gt; the steering gear box... The sound is not from CV joint, I think. Does
&gt; anyone have any idea where I might look?
