My son was heading to his job in Newark, N.J., from our home ( his parents) in
Houston, Texas when his engine blew in Roanoke, Virginia. Does anyone know of
a good, honest mechanic in the area? He could sure use a helping hand - he's
stuck and really needs to get back. Thanks so much in advance to anyone that
might resond to this.

God Bless,
Concerned Parents
