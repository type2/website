Bill-
	Is it possible for you to get the engine stripped down and have the case
work done ahead of time and go out and buy yourself a quality rebuild kit
and then have someone assemble the engine for you?  I had the same
problem out here in Yellowstone.  My engine died on my 69.  I tore the
engine down to the case and had the engine line bored and bought a
rebuild kit and did it myself.  All with the help of a book called &quot;how
to rebuild your VW engine&quot;  It was teriffic.  I never attempted a rebuild
before.  But with the help of this book I made it possible.  I hope I
helped.


My 2 cents
