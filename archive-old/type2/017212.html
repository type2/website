Subject: RE: Heater Questions from a Newbie

John,

You're right about the blower, but someone else already told you that.
If you haven't done it already, make sure the holes for the heater
pipes... the ones the fan would hook to... are plugged until you get the
heater stuff back in there. Otherwise, you're going to be sucking hot
air into the engine compartment from under the cylinders... not a good
thing for the engine cooling situation.

of our old VWs!

&gt; 
&gt; Here's a question that has been bothering me for a while. DPO really
&gt; went to town on my bus. Looks like they removed the heat exchangers
&gt; (just pipe from heads to muffler), connectors from the heat exchangers
&gt; to tube that ducts air to the front, and the heater blower. Shouldn't
&gt; the heater fan be mounted right above the engine with tubes running
&gt; down to where the heat exchangers used to live ??? Found one half of a
&gt; inline fuse and I'm guessing that the other half is gone with the
&gt; heater blower and rest of the heating system. Pmail me as this
&gt; probably will bore everyone else.
