&gt; &gt;Today's fun fact:  The Bosch L-Jetronic system used in our Buses uses

&gt; &gt;Intake air volume
&gt; &gt;Intake air temperature
&gt; &gt;Cylinder head temperature
&gt; &gt;Engine RPM
&gt; 
&gt; While the above ARE the only inputs to the 'brain', don't forget that the
&gt; pressure regulator adjusts fuel pressure based on vacuum (a.k.a. load). This

Good call on the pressure regulator, but I don't think it serves to
enrich the mixture at any particular throttle setting.  Rather, it
serves to keep the fuel pressure in the system at a constant 28 psi
regardless of other factors.  

The pressure regulator consists of a spring-loaded ball valve and a
diaphragm.  The ball valve controls fuel flow into the fuel return
line.  Naturally the spring is calibrated so that the system fuel
pressure can be 28 psi.  Fuel delivery from the fuel pump is constant,
no matter the engine speed.  So at periods of low load, not as much fuel
is needed at the injectors which results in an excess of fuel in the
fuel pipes.  If there was no return line, the pressure in the pipes
could rise quite a bit and a higher pressure would make for a rich
mixture since more fuel would be forced from the injectors for any given
amount of time they are open.

So we have the pressure regulator.  In low-fuel situations like the
above, the excess fuel pressure pushes on the diaphragm, the fuel return
pipe is uncovered, and fuel flows into the return line and returns to
the gas tank and fuel pressure is held constant.

I may be wrong but if I remember correctly the vacuum part of the
pressure regulator is more of an emissions device than anything else. 
When the throttle is snapped closed, you have a high vacuum, which pulls
on the diaphragm in the pressure regulator and opens the fuel return
line wider.  This lowers the fuel pressure and by doing that reduces HC
emissions on engine deceleration when there is no load and lots of fuel
is not needed.

This is my understanding of how the pressure regulator works.  I believe
the only mixture inputs are those I mentioned above in the original
message.  

This does, however, indicate that you can manipulate the mixture and
therefore increase power by using a pressure regulator with a heavier
spring.  I don't know if these are available for our engines.  A
slightly rich mixture will give you maximum power but of course will
lower fuel economy.
