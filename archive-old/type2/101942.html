&gt;  Is there any chance that this

I know that Weddle Engineering has a locked diff
for the vanagon trannies.  (Lockright I believe.)
 At least one guy on the vanagon_dot_com list runs
it, in a South African spec 5 speed no less.  The
good news is that all the railbuggy dudes prefer
the stronger bus tranny, so I think Weddle also
offers the diff lock for the bus tranny as well. 


You don't really want limited slip.  There  are
lotsa 4wd sites that will explain the difference
if you wanna do a yahoo search.
