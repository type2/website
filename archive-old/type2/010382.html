Subject: 71 single cab butt cheeks Q
Message-ID: &lt;19991018232310.82344.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Im looking at having the battery area replace on my '71 single cab, but the 
guy who does this type of work said he would have to fabricate it all. I 
asked why and he told me that he didnt know where to get replacement panels 
for single cabs. Are they different than normal bus ones and if so, does 
anyone know who carries them?

Thanks,
David
