Subject: Re: [T2] AC Conversion to new &quot;Freon&quot;



Dave 34 articles in the archive if you search for &quot;freon&quot;, but the one I 
was thinking about is in the library under 

Air Conditioned Bus by David Schwarze

I have heard more on this...maybe on the vintagvw list though.

My vote is for freeze-12 I think.  I have heard that it cools better than 
R134.

Good luck, dave

&gt; Hopefully i am doing this reply right-advise me if wrong and it gets

&gt; I was just checking the archives myself looking for anything i could 
&gt; find on ac and didnt find anything for the conversion.

&gt; &gt;&gt; What has everyone done to convert to the new still Freon (will new what
&gt; &gt;&gt; 10 years ago?).  I'm thinking of buying a Bay Window, until the Split 
&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt; &gt;&gt; done, and it has Air.  The system has never been converted over.
