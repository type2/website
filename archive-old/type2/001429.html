Hey sean, The thing I like most about that powerstroke is the 2nd gear take
off's just like first gear, even with 1,000 pounds of goodies in the cargo
area...

I probably should not have let you drive it, now you will never be satisfied
with a 2.0...LOL

You are now in &quot;line&quot; for the engine, let me know when to go ahead......

&gt; I know this is an older string, but I hope you will find this angle
somewhat
&gt; different and interesting:
&gt;
&gt; I had the misfortune of riding in Jake's bus with the Powerstoke engine
last
&gt; night. I say misfortune because now I want one. His shop is located in the
&gt; mountains of North GA and that bus (FULLY loaded with tools and parts)
&gt; climbed those mountains like we were going downhill drafting a semi.
Coming
&gt; from a background of high-performance Type 1 engines, the thing I miss the
&gt; most about driving my new bus is the comfort level I had when approaching
&gt; the steep stuff. This bus drove through those same passes faster and
&gt; stronger than my 73 Super with a very stout 1776 ever had time to.
&gt;
&gt; I dared not ask for the particulars, but WOW that thing was quick and
&gt; smooth. After about a 30 minute ride, we pulled back into the shop; and
the
&gt; engine was so cool that I was able to leave my hand on any part of it
&gt; (except the exhaust) without getting burned. Sure the Powerstroke motor
&gt; costs a ton, and isn't for everyone - but man was it fun.
&gt;
&gt; He's soon going to start rebuilding the engine in my '72 and along with a
&gt; little performance tuning here-and-there, he's going to install the same
&gt; external cooling set-up he's described in the past. It will be a while
&gt; before it's completed since I'm in the process of selling/buying a house,
&gt; but once it's done I'll report back my findings.

&gt; The type 4 engine is a well designed beast, however it was originally
&gt; designed for a 411&amp; 914, both of which are hard to kill in stock foem, and
&gt; both of which have problems ever getting the oil hot enough to rid
&gt; contaminants..
&gt;
&gt; Face it, you have a 5,000 pound bus, most cars of that weight are V8
&gt; powered..
&gt;
&gt; And yes, I'm one of those guys who believes in external coolers, and also
&gt; one who shuts engines down at 235 oil temp.....Thats OK, my bus averages
&gt; 185, most of the time, but it does take 7 qts to fill it up.. just wait
till
&gt; it gets the dry sump, and CIS with a turbo this winter!!
&gt;
&gt; Actually my Powerstroke engine ran 220 oil temp all the time without the
&gt; extrenal cooler, I added it for pulling all the weight of my trailer and
&gt; engine parts bins, and even engines..especially when climbing grades..
&gt;
&gt; BTW almost every thermostat I see is not functioning correctly, and the
oil
&gt; cooler is only getting 1/2 of what it should be with proper adjustment..

&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;oil pressure above 37psi, the stock oil cooler is by-passed, and that
VW
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;itself says that at the high end of operating temps, acceptable oil
&gt; pressure
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;at rpms above 2000 is only 12.5psi.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I hope you mean &quot;below 2000 rpm&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Indeed, the Neandereers who designed the lubrication and cooling

&gt; &gt; &gt;so.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hardly.  The stock OIL cooling system on a type 4 is marginal at best.
&gt; The
&gt; &gt; 5% grade, 100 degree air temp scenario you mention with heavy throttle
for
&gt; &gt; longer than a few minutes will cause oil temps to skyrocket to unsafe
&gt; &gt; levels even in a meticulously maintaned Stock engine.  Been there, done
&gt; &gt; that.  Have to be extra stingy with the throttle under those conditions
to
&gt; &gt; protect the motor, or become another statistic, broken down on the side
of
&gt; &gt; the road.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; These are not Porsches or Mercedes, folks, they are VWs.  By design they
&gt; &gt; were built cheap with lots of corners cut.  Some cannot accept this, but
&gt; &gt; it's the truth!  Is the heating system overengineered?  How about
&gt; &gt; insulation?  Lots of that?  Crash protection?  Stock seats comfy?  How
&gt; &gt; about those ultra-reliable stock dual Solex carbs?  The cardboard glove
&gt; &gt; box?  The starter/ignition wiring?  Heck, how about the lack of
&gt; horsepower?
&gt; &gt; Is it really safe to pull that 5% highway grade in 2nd gear at 25mph?
&gt; &gt; Would an overengineered vehicle have these weaknesses?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Don't get me wrong, I love my bus... but don't try and tell me that it
is
&gt; &gt; the ultimate engineering marvel because it is WAY short of that.  Or
maybe
&gt; &gt; I'm just missing your point.
