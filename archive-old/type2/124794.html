Subject: RE: [T2] timing the SVDA

The assumption is made in Bentley you are working with the distributor
originally intended for that engine model.
Since the distributor and it's position itself is responsible to
advance, total advance, and advance curve, the timing is most sensitive
to the dizzy.

AL


...

Then how come the bentley specs out idle advance settings based on 
engine model, not distributor?
