Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line hose clamps

Mike,
The clamp pictured look to be an over cranked stainless aircraft type
clamp.
They work fine if you buy the good one's.
This looks like an example of a cheapo which likely would fail.

Some folks prefer spring clamps, some prefer aircraft type clamps.

Make you own decision on this and go with it--


Later,

Terry

does anyone have a good recommendation for hose clamps for fuel lines. I
was looking at Richard Atwell's site and he said not to use this kind:
http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/.cv/ratwell/Sites/.Pictures/FuelHose/08-Wrong
Clamp2.JPG-thumb_140_105.jpg
and that's what I'm using now. Is there another better type to use?
Thanks,
Mike
