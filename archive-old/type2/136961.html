&gt;Is there anyone out there passing CA smog without the EGR stuff in place?

Althought I doubt most smog shops know what to look for if they detect tampering you will fail the test.

&gt;maybe just a nice tight exhaust system and a brand new CAT would do the
&gt;trick, or should I just start working now to find all of these parts?
&gt;
&gt;I need a crossover pipe, CAT, and all of the EGR stuff currently. (thats
&gt;whats missing anyway)

Do you have a CA model that requires the CAT?

&gt;the EGR stuff is all blocked off, almost looking like it never came with it,
&gt;but from the Mcode I guess it did at some point.

The smog tech can't read m-codes but the emission sticker shows there is EGR and your BAR label should mention it also unless this is your first CA smog.

&gt;I just wasnt sure if one of those systems would be effective enough in
&gt;reducing emitions to warrant skipping the other.

I can't detect a large change in %CO with the EGR on/off the bus. If I could measure NOx I might notice the impact.

Right now the air temperature is so cold I don't think excessive combustion temperatures are a problem if you smog your bus in Dec/Jan.
