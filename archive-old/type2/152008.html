&gt; I've been using Castrol 5w/50 Syntec fully synthetic oil lately cause I got
&gt; a great deal on the stuff - Costco sells it by the box for like $23.00 Cdn
&gt; for maybe 6 litres or so - the same stuff at Crappy Tire is over $7 per
&gt; litre - so what do the folks think about running 5w/50?

the 5W-50 was all I ever ran when I could get it, haven't been able to
find any lately so have been running the 15W-50 from Mobil 1  (pay about
$5 US for a liter when I get it)
