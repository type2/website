Subject: Gas Tank Bung?

Volks:

As vulgar as the subject sounds, I curious about the size of the fuel
outlet from the fuel tank on FI busses.  I'm converting from a
carburated to FI engine.  Currently I have 10mm(?/stock carb size)
connecting to a 3/8&quot; tee.  One outlet to the fuel pump and one outlet
receiving the return fuel line.  As the engine reaches operating
temperature, fuel pressure drops to 0/zilch psi.  I think the smaller
line at the tank is what is causing my fuel starvation problem. So, my
questions are: 

1) What size fuel line comes out of a FI fuel tank?

2) If this fuel line is larger than 10mm would it fit my tank?

TIA
