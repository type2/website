Subject: Re: [T2] 68 only?

Great list from Karl!

To that I would add gauge cluster with fluted light covers for the 
gen and oil light, green oil pressure light and speedo with odometer 
south of the pivot point for the speedo needle.

I have been told that there are internals to the transmission which 
are 68 only. I also recall some difference in the bolts that attach 
the CV joints.

Enjoy your VW
