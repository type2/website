Subject: Best way to wire an aftermarket fuel pump

What is the safest way to wire an electric fuel pump so that it will shut down
when the engine stalls?
I have read some about the alternator, and some about the oil pressure switch,
but which is the best way.
I am going to convert my '78 Westfalia to a progressive (too late, it's on its
way via UPS).B  I have owned the bus with its original FI for about 8 years,
and it's been a good run, but I have been fighting intermittant starting
problems, high idle problems, and lately there has been stalling (unless I
catch it and feather the gas pedal, then I can usually keep it running)B I've
been through the Bentley and done alot of reading on here with some luck, but
I'm not going to throw a bunch of money at replacing parts on a 30 year old
system.B 
With each new problem my comfort zone decreases, so that now I don't even like
to drive it to town, and that's only 8 miles!B  On our last VW cruise the bus
stalled 5 times in about 14 miles.B  I was teaching my daughter how to drive
it this morning and we barely made it home.B  I want to take it on trips, but
I'm afraid that it won't be coming back.B  To complicate matters it is an
auto, so towing it becomes much harder.
FI parts are nonexistent here, and even though I do realize the negatives to
changing to carb(s) and I know most of you like the stock FI, I am not able to
enjoy this bus the way it was intended.B  Indeed, the FI is keeping me from a
nice private pondside campout tonight.B  Kids aren't happy.B  The FI is gone,
for now at least.
I will keep everything from the FI setup, but I long for the reduced
complexity of a fuel metering device I can work on beside the interstate.B  Or
at the Drive In movie atB one in the morning.B  Or at the pond in the hollow
while everyone else is eating breakfast.
Without the FI I can at least get it home...
Now, I want to wire the fuel pump safely.B  Is there an accepted method that
will allow the pump to start and run the engine, but become disabled in the
event of an accident or stalling?B 
I have a two pole oil pressure switch.
Also, is there a pump that you folks reccommend?B  I have a really nice new
Carter fuel pump (6 psi, 72GPH)left over from another project.B  Going to go
with a regulator, too.B  What pressure do the Weber progressives like?B  Tell
me how you are set up.
Any and all info concerning the wiring and/or pump and regulator, and even
setting up the Weber progressives themselves would be greatly appreciated.B 
To late to talk me out of a progressive, though.B  I know about the icing and
I have a few ideas.B  I'll deal with the shortcomings and work it out.B  It
isn't my primary vehicle.

Many thanks,
Greg
Moundsville, WV
