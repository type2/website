&quot;David &amp; Susan Bell&quot; said...........with tongue in cheekgue:

&lt;Doyt-
 &gt;Let me get this straight.......you don't think it's a good idea, right?
 &gt;Dave, tongue firmly in cheek.
 &gt;PS: Some of those costs you mention seem a *tad* high, from my =
 &gt;experience.
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
And the old geezer replied:

Good criticism. I think you are right.

But he continued to wonder........

So, which ones are a tad high, and by how much?  (At $55/hr labor and 
rounded off)

Was it an error to count labor? If so, some of them ARE a tad high. But the 
question was &quot;worth&quot; which implies at least considering mainly the money 
involved.... and lots of other things like the value of a smile, 
etc.   This may need some tighter boundries.

Then there were variables like &quot;how safe do you want it to be?&quot;  When it 
comes to brakes.......I'd agree that $800 is high.....representing a Midas 
lifetime brake job.   I'll back that down to $500.  There.....shaved $300 
right off the bat. Or, do it yourself and save about $250 more. How about 
using $250? Better? I'll take a 'yes' on that one.

And, maybe they could get away with not replacing the rotten front axle and 
steering box. Maybe that one doesn't need another front axle from Texas. 
But mine did. Personally, I'd rather make that choice on the side of 
safety. In fact, I did. And it cost about a grand before it was all over. I 
hope they look at that axle and steering box.

I guess they could rebuild the engine/engines  themselves. That might shave 
another thousand.
Or, they could ask RAT to put in something even more expensive.....up 
around $5000. There is considerable latitude there.  I did offer an option 
of $2,000.

In defense of the $10,000 total, I've seen at least 3 buses in the past few 
years stickered at $10,000. They looked _better_ than mine looked when it 
was new, in 1976. And my figures didn't include new pop-top canvas, or 
redoing all the fabrics and rubber and inside panels. Now the total 
estimate starts moving a tad toward the higher figure.

But I'm allowed to have those opinions, high, low, right, wrong, debatable. 
But am I allowed to express those opinions on this list? Probably should 
exercise a little judgement there.

It was a pretty tough question. There was a fellow at Ohio State who was 
spending many of his youthful years working on a doctoral thesis in 
Philosophy. He picked the task of defining the meaning of &quot;good.&quot; He had 
been at it for 3 years. Here we must wrestle with the meaning 
of    &quot;worth.&quot;  The tasks seem comparable.

I still think those buses in the original question are worth a 
lot.......lots of money, lots of fun, lots of work....lots. And I also 
think their present owner should give them to someone, rather than parking 
them in his scrap yard like prisoners, and dismembering them on demand. I 
hope they escape. Run, little buses,  run....run....I talk that way to my 
bus frequently.
