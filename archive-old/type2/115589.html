Subject: RMMW catalogues &amp; sale

Arrived in the mail today! The new RMMW catalogue.  They have combined the 
air cooled and water cooled into one.  If anyone out there is not on their 
mailing list and needs a copy, let me know and I'll scoot on down, grab one 
and mail it to you.  They also have a notice in it about a &quot;Moving Sale&quot; 
(the building sold last month and they will be moving the facility to 
Colorado Springs in Sept). The ad reads &quot; August 9...Everything on sale, 
many items below cost&quot;.  This is the same day as their annual car show.  If 
there is something you desperately need, email me your shopping lists and 
I'll do my best to be your personal shopper that day if you can't make it 
out here.  If you can make it out here and need a place to camp/shower etc, 
email me that as well.

Mary
