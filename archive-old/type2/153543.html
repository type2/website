Subject: Re: [T2] bilge blower heater retrofit - was: Oil cooler as heat
  source inside van.

Be careful with this idea Mike, et al; had a friend who did it, and melted 
the blowers in about 10 minutes, because they are only plastic bodied. He 
melted the fan blades too. It really stunk. The heat coming out of the 
exchangers is really hot!, enough to melt plastic. He said if he did this 
again, he would NOT have done it so they were &quot;pulling&quot; or sucking the heat 
out of the exchangers, instead he would have mounted them BEFORE the 
exchangers so they &quot;pushed&quot; or blew through them. We have the single 
squirrel cage fan in the engine compartment; his thought was to put one of 
these high volume beasts on each side, pushing huge amounts of air through 
the exchangers, and keeping the blowers on the cold side of them. Does that 
make sense??
