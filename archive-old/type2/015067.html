&gt;I don't think this is all that unusual on original engines.  I rebuilt my
&gt;stock '79 calif. engine at 142k due to dropped valve seat.  

I rebuilt my 82 Westy engine at about 160,000 km, because it was leaking
oil.  Everywhere.  The leak was caused by pressure in the crankcase, which
was caused by bad rings.  I think these things just wear out at about
150,000 km.  But to get that distance, here are some tips:
1.	MAKE SURE THE THERMOSTAT WORKS.  That's the most important.  The moment
you start the engine the temp gauge should start climbing.  If you don't
have a gauge, get one.
2.	Use a heavier oil than you think you need.  20 - 50 summer, 15 - 30
winter.  Change it every 6000 KM. Use a Bosche filter.
3.	As soon as the engine is started, drive.  Slowly, until the temp is 250
F.  Should happen pretty fast.  Then take it easy for another couple of
minutes.  If you have to go from cold to freeway right away, drive around
the block a couple of times.  DON&quot;T idle the engine to warm up.
4.	Don't over-rev.  4500 is plenty.  Call it 65 mph, unless you talk nicely
to a trucker and get a draught.  
Ian, 82 Westy
