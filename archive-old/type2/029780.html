&gt; I believe Gene Berg in his tech writings states not to filter the suction

To give you some idea why, remember that whenever a liquid is &quot;sucked&quot;
from a container open to the atmosphere, the force moving the fluid is
supplied by atmospheric pressure.  Therefore, the maximum pressure that
can be applied to a filter on the suction side of a pump is 14.7PSI.

Also, if there are air leaks between the filter and pump, air will be
pulled easily into the oil, which is bad for lubrication.
