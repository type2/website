Subject: Re: [T2] Bedliner Sprays (Was:POR 15 Corrosion Control Process)

Don,
If the metal surface is prepped properly--and scuffed up--either the
Rino Hyde--or the spray can urethane bedliner will adhere to almost
anything.
Spray some of it on your finger---let it set up for 10 minutes---try and
get it off--

This product is really sticky and doesn't come off very easy--

I have used this product for udercoating on both my Vans and Bus--
Pressure wash the bottom clean--and spray it on--

It's been on the bottom of my 85 for at least 5 years--hasen't moved an
inch.--
And ths one I drove in the winter months.
Salt doesn't touch it--

My front and rear control arms on the Vanagons still look like they were
painted black at the factory--

Pretty tough stuff-

Morton is the outfit that makes the rattle Can Bed Liner--

I know of a few guys that not only did their beds of their pick
up's--but aslo had the underside done in Rino Hyde--

I'm impressed.

 
I picked up a rattle can of bedliner to experiment with on my bus in the
same way... As a mass addition to panels, insulation, etc. 
I've only used it on a scrap of wood to play with. I like how it goes
on, but it feels rather rigid... I doubt it would be very good as a
sound insulation. 
From what I've read about Rhino and other bedliners, it protects PAINT.
Not metal. 
Don
