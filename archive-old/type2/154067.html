Subject: Solar Battery Unit

Just wanted to send this all out on my latest upgrade on my 78 Riviera 2l FI
Bus.  I was having battery charging/draining issues.  Cliff gave me a
pointer on replacing the Alternator Relay, and that seems to work.  However,
the Solar Panel unit was long since planned for this reason and also I am
going to be putting in an inverter and wanted to keep everything juiced.  I
used to have another solar panel and that was ok, but Boys and their Toys
prevailed. Now I just have to get my Hankooks put on and a few other tidbits
and I will be out running around.
