Just a few words about Busdepot;
Living in Hawaii, having something you order from the the mainland taking 
time to get here is a common occurance.That's just the way it is.(even 
&quot;overnight air&quot; takes 2 1/2  day's). I'm grateful I don't have to pay $30 for 
a seal that cost's $6.50 from the Busdepot.
The main complaint I've heard in this string of commentary has been...TI ME...
I say...if people are so concerned about saving time, what the heck are you 
driving a VW
Bus  for...the highest maintenance vehicle I have ever come across. But  we 
love-m, don't we?
Mahalo Ron , for getting the highest qulity pretty consistantly for the 
lowest price! (and I really appreciate knowing where the parts are coming 
from before I buy, no one else does that)
Aloha from the Big Island,
Jeff Raven
