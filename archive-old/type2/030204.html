I finally completed my slow job of converting the '71 from generator to
alternator.  Here's some notes on the process.

I bought a &quot;conversion kit&quot; from a Fibercraft in Reno, NV.  The alternator
was a new Bosch Brasilain unit.  The alternator stand and tin were made in
China.  The kit cost about $120, but by the time I added the other
parts I needed:

Alternator fuel pump and pushrod
Gaskets for the alternator stand
Oil  filler gland nut tool
Alternator pulley nut (old one was worn)
Fan belt

and a few other things that I wanted to replace while I was in there the
bill came to around $200

After pondering the Chinese parts, I went to D &amp; D Wrecking
in Sparks, NV and the friendly folk there supplied me with good usedGerman
tin and stand for $28.  The tin was much better formed and thicker than
the Chinese stuff.  I couldn't tell if the Chinese stand was good or not,
but I feel more comfortable seeing &quot;Zundefolge 1-4-3-2&quot; on the stand!

Every time I remove the alternator with the engine in place I say &quot;never
again&quot;, but by the next time it comes out the memory fades and I try it
again.  Believe me, it's a lot easier in the long run to remove the
engine!  To start, I disconnected the generator wiring and disconnected
the negative terminal of the battery.

During a previous removal, I replaced the screws in doghouse area and on
the ends of the fan shroud with hex head bolts so that they could be
loosened in close quarters,  The doghouse and hoover bit screw loosened
easily.  I removed the carb and fuel pump, undid the themostat, pulled out
the throttle tube, and then undid the generator, lifted the housing, and
worked the fan out of the housing.  this process required a number of blue
words as the fan is a very tight fit in the housing hole and the shrould
has to be lifted all the way to the top of the engine bay to provide
minimum fan clearance.

The next challenge was the removal of the gland nut from the oil filler.
Even with the proper tool this was a nasty chore, since the torque is
carried through what is essentially a partial screwdriver slot.  I used a
propane torch to heat the generator stand around the gland nut and that
did the trick.

With the gland nut out, the alternator stand came off easily.  A long
period of parts cleaning followed.  I also pulled the left end of the
intake manifold to replace the manifold seals, which were cracked.

The used tin went on the new alternator.  The fan hub went on and I
immediately noted that the fan touched the tin.  No problem, that's what
these washers are for, right?  Well, with the two thick washers and all
the shims on the alternator hub, the fan just barely touched the tin.  I
added another shim from my father's shim collection and it did the trick.
Although I made the existing parts work, I suspect that there might be a
different fan hub for the alternator setup!

The used alternator stand went on next, along with the new pushrod and
fuel pump.  The oil filler screwed on with the gland nut and a healthy dab
of anti-sieze.  The fan went back into the fan housing with more blue
words and juggling.  I managed to drop one of the 6mm bolts and it
disappeared.  Perhaps I'll find it next time I have the tin off.  The
alternator sat on its stand perfectly.  Unfortunately, the fan shroud
didn't fall into the cylinder tin perfectly and it took me the better part
of an hour to coax the tin into the correct relationship and tighten the
screws.

Wiring was easy, but I had to make some adapters to use the existing
wiring.  At the voltage regulator, you need to connect the green and blue
wires to each other and also connect the two heavy red and red/white wire
to each other.  I did this with homemade double-male spade connectors made
from copper strip.  These connectors must be hefty and secure as they
carry a lot of current.  I insulated the connectors with vinyl tubing.  At
the alternator end of the harness, the hot (red/white) and ground (brown)
wires already have the correct connectors, but the green wire needed an
adapter that has a female spade connector on one end and a ring terminal
on the other.  I made one from a spade terminal and more copper strip.

I installed the new belt (is it me, or are the Continental belts getting
tighter?).

Hooked up the battery.  Turned the key to &quot;on&quot;.  Alt and oil lights on.
Good!  Fired up the engine.  Oh-oh, alt light still on.  Blip the
throttle, light goes out.  Repeat.  Same thing.  Perhaps my idle speed is
too low or I have a bad connection in the alt light wiring.  In any case,
battery voltage is 13.7V, so the alternator is doing the job!

That's it!  Thanks to Chuck Notmeyer for pointing me at parts sources!
