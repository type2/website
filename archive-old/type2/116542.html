Subject: EGR Vac Leak

I was tracing down a vac leak today and came across a couple interesting
items. My 75 FI 1800 bus has been running fairly well except at idle. I had
to adjust the idle speed screw almost all the way open to keep it idling.
While looking for a leak I knock the tube coming from the egr to the
throttle control  it way almost off completely at the throttle housing and
underneath the egr valve it was completely unattached as well  in fact the
casting to place retaining bolt is broken- there is nothing underneath.  I
am pretty sure that this is the source of my vac leak because as I moved it
the bus stalled.  My question is simple is the missing egr filter a problem?
Do I need to replace this to have my bus idling properly again?  I dont
know if the egr filter set up I see in Bentley was there before I bought
her. I dont have to worry about emission testing.

Eric
