Subject: Factory Details for Your VW

A couple of people have asked about getting details from the factory about
the history of their v'dub. I've got 2 snail mail contact addresses:

VW Brezelffenstrevereinigung e. V. Customer Assistance 
Ernst Peter Hagen Volkswagen AG
Amselweg 4 Postfach, 3180
D3073 Liebenau, GERMANY Wolfsburg 1, Germany

&quot;Brezelffenstrevereinigung&quot; means Pretzel Window Club and refers to the fact
that the Beetle's early rear window looks like a European Pretzel.

Herchel Dalton.

and 
VW AG
Marketing
38436 Wolfsburg
Germany

I've had an email back from them with some info on my bay and a split, the
address is
devwlkdb_at_ibmmail_dot_com but I know some people have had trouble with it.

I got the contact through Pim van Loom, ploon_at_zeelandnet.nl

He may be able to help with more info.
