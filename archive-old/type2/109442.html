&gt; you will have to pull the dizzy out to see what the numbers are on the
side of it...
&gt; but remember if you pull the dizzy out you will have to set the timing
again possibly...
&gt; once you get the numbers post them someone here can then tell you what
dizzy you have...

The identifying numbers face forward and are difficult to access.
You can read the numbers with a mirror and a flashlight.
If you must remove the dizzy, do not loosen  the clamp,
but unbolt the clamp from the case. The timing adjustment
will remain as previous.
