&gt; Hello to The List,
&gt;
&gt; Just installed a 30/31 on my 70 1600 single port.  And I realize that I have
&gt; (maybe) a small problem.  I consulted my Bentley about adjusting idle, etc.
&gt; There were no references to the 30/31.  In fact I can find no references to
&gt; the 30/31 anywhere.  My assumption is that these carbs are treated like the
&gt; 30PICT family?  Is that correct?  If not, could you point me toward a good
&gt; reference for this little beast?

Closest reference I found was the 34PICT-3, as installed on the '71.

&gt; AND..........I just finished converting my taillights from USA stock 70 to
&gt; European stock 70.  They are much brighter and the addition of another bulb
&gt; results in the entire oval area of the lens being used for light as well as
&gt; the amber turn signals.  Way easier to see at night!

Good idea!  Write up how to do it and get it in the library!

George Lyle
