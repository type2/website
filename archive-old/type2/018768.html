Subject: A different Oil Temp Sender location?
Message-ID: &lt;378A2FBB.F97F4C08_at_intop_dot_net&gt;

Volks:

I know this is a FART.  But, theoretically, the ideal place to take the
temperature is at the bearings. Correct?  Well, if this is the case,
wouldn't it be accurate to install the sender at the fitting on the oil
port in the case of a full-flow type1 engine.  Adapters are readily
available with the 1/8 NPT thread.  This should read the temp
immediately before it enters the bearings.

Thoughts? Comments? Dirty Remarks?

TIA
Shawn
