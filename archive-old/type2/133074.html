Subject: Re: [T2] Painting Engine Tin

Rob,

http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/newengine/

All powder coated except for the very front piece(por-15).

I did all of it(except the fan shroud) including the heater boxes in my 
shop oven($50).  Heater boxes in hi-temp &quot;aluminum color&quot; and the sheet 
metal in semi-gloss black.  Plenum and intake runners, same as the heater 
boxes.

Yours looks terrific...yes, you can powder coat in yellow or *neon* yellow 
if you want.

I have powder from both of these companies...

Take a look at some of the powders these guys have...awesome!!!
All it takes is a sand-blaster, an old electric oven, and a powder coat 
gun....ya don't need the fancy expensive one either.

Cheers, dave

&gt; That's the tin, etc. I painted for my old Spiffy bus. It was done in some
&gt; &quot;heavy duty&quot; paint I found at NAPA, after being sandblasted and

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; If you have the money powder coating is the way to go. I am hoping to do
&gt; that to the tin on Sunshine. I believe they can color match to just about
&gt; any color. If anyone else has input on powder coating I am interested!!
