Subject: Aw, nuts...  smoke's pouring out of my tailpipe
Date: Sat, 11 Nov 2000 18:51:23 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I noticed clouds of blue smoke pouring out the tailpipe today for the first
time.  I can't think of any event that provoked it, I figure one or more of
the rings just gave up the ghost.  I don't have a compression gauge, but
suppose I will find one.

Now, the bus is running (in terms of acceleration, starting,etc.) just fine.
But I have two problems:  the first is the engine/smoke. Obviously it will
need to be fixed.  Worse, in a way, is that I'm up to my ears renovating a
fire damaged house, and can't afford the $ or time to pull and repair the
engine.  So...  with an extra garage at my disposal, I'm going to mothball
the bus for the winter, and attack things in the spring.

What do you masters of German mechanics advise?  A brim full gas tank with
stabilizer and good shot of oil in each cylinder?  Anything else?

Not a happy situation, but I'm just going to have to do this.  Any words of
advice on narrowing the smoke source, just so I know what I'm in for come
May or so, is welcome.

Thanks much.
