Subject: Re: [T2] transport suggestions

Morgan,

I had my bus and a jetta shipped from CA to TN this past summmer.

My company paid for it and I used the internet to find a shipping &quot;broker&quot;

These brokers bring the customer and the truck drivers who are basically
independent contractors together.

Needless to say, I had &quot;issues&quot; during the move.  Bad communication,
misunderstandings about time/place/money.  I was on the road to TN
when the bus was picked up so we couldn't go over VW &quot;peculilarities&quot;,
and he completely reconfigured his delivery schedule every day I spoke to
him,
showed up 2 weeks early looking for cash even though my contract with the
broker specified that I could pay him by company check.

My advice is to attempt to eliminate the middle man and deal directly with
an owner/operator so you can hash out all the details.  Once you send your
money to the broker, they could care less about you.

&gt; Lurker here asking question. Have bought a 73 Camper and trying to
&gt; get it from Iowa to VA. Not having much luck with the
&gt; transportation broker. Arranged first day of pickup on January
&gt; 23rd, and no move yet. Do any of you fine gentlemen (or ladies)
&gt; have a transporter they would suggest for a running bus?
&gt;
&gt; For me to take the time off work, arrange truck and trailer, gas
&gt; and all I don't think it is feasible for me to go get it. Plus
&gt; there are heat issues and brrrrrrrrrrrr, thats a long drive with no
&gt; heat.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any advice,
&gt; Morgan and his first Westy
