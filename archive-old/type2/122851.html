&quot;Wow. With that in mind I might reconsider getting a cover for the bus. The

cover for my small car doesn't have grommet holes to tie to so I do have
problems in the wind without two people. Did your cover come with grommet
holes or did you add them? What kind of cover is it and where did you get
it?
Thanks,
Bill&quot;

My cover is the Bus Depot Stormshield, and it came with grommet holes (one
at each of the sides) installed.  There is also a flap of fabric on the
inside of the grommet hole so that your rope or other fastening means does
not rub on the bus - nice touch!
