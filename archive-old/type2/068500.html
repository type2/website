Subject: 71 westy clutch parts source needed

Can anyone recommend a reliable source for stock (not performance) clutch
parts (especially the presure plate) for my 71 westy with 1600dp, code:AE?

JC Whitney doesn't seem to carry anything for this particular year.

Any tips on making sure they understand what I need are appreciatted.

Also, contact numbers/addresses if you have ,em handy.
