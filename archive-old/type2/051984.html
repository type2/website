Subject: Re: [T2] Beautiful blue Bus rides tall again!

Hooray!!!!

It works!  It works!

For those that have been following this thread, the
problem turned out to be a bad rotor/distributer cap. 
I went to several FLAPS to get parts for a mirad of
different scenarios.  Once I came back, the first
thing I tired (because its the easiest) was the new
distributer and rotor, and sure enough its working
WONDERFULLY!  I drove back and forth on the highway,
cheering wildly, just to be absolutely sure.  No
problems.  Bus is riding tall again.

Thanks very very very much to everybody for your
suggestions and support!  This list rocks, VWs rule
and I'm a happy camper once more.  YEEEAAAA!!!

L8r,
Dano!
