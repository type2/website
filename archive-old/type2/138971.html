Subject: Re: [T2] tranny = engine longevity?

&gt; While at work today I (finally) pieced together that a good way to keep rpms

&gt; confirm this?

Except you have to be careful with the gearing because if 5th is too slow
then the slower running engine may not cool as well.

4th gear in the bus is already an overdrive gear (0.82 or 0.89) so you'd
want to adjust the R&amp;P ratio as well.
