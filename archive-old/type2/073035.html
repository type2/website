Subject: Re: VW info??


&gt;       Does anyone have a URL for a site that lists all models of VW's,
&gt;year by year, and what engines they had? I'm particularly looking for
&gt;what years had diesel engines --- asked on the vw-diesel and vanagon
&gt;lists, but got no response.

The Vanagon FTP Archive has extensive lists of this sort of stuff but the
only remaining source for it (gerry.vanagon_dot_com) seems to be permanently
offline. Joel Walker might have copies since he's the one who compiled most
of it.

I've only heard of diesels c. 1982-83 but what do I know...
