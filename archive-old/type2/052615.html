Just a few things, quickly. 

Exhaust flange and port leaks show themselves as black carbon in the
vicinity. If they are substantial, they report themselves audibly. 

Make sure the tailpipe is in good order. If you have an 'extractor' with
the tailpipe/s centered, the fumes will rise across the back of the van at
speed. The fumes can enter the rear door hatch if the seal is not
functioning. Check that rear upper hatch seal.

&gt;I've got a problem with exhaust gasses in the cabin of my 70 Bus.  Not much, 
&gt;mind you, but definitely there.  Enough to give me a slight headache after a 
&gt;half hour run.  My question is this..............  how are these gasses 
&gt;getting into the cabin?
