If you can get the torsion arms off, and you clean them up...you can shop
for a deal at the machine shop.  I got the old ones out, but were unable to
press the new ones in...you need access to a big press...............I paid
my machine shop (one I never went in before) and they charged me $20.

&gt; &gt; Anyone out there know a rough estimate of how much new ball joints will
set
&gt; &gt; me back on a 70 Westy?
&gt;
&gt; Depends :-)
&gt;
&gt; New ball joints (German) from Bus Depot are $16.95
&gt; (http://www.busdepot_dot_com, part number 211 405 371A)  You need 4, so figure
&gt; $68 for a set.  Then you need to remove the trailing arms, press the old
&gt; ball joints out and press the new ones in. Then reinstall the trailing
&gt; arms. So it can be as low as $68 plus a front-end alignment.
&gt;
&gt; If you have not got a press, you can remove the arms and take them to a
&gt; machine shop, where they will do the press work for ~$100 *or* you can buy
&gt; rebuilt trailing arms from bus boys for $174.95 +$50 core
&gt; (http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/bbbjarms2.htm). This would make the cost about
&gt; $200 (varying with shipping and/or cost of the machinist).
&gt;
&gt; Or you can pay someone to pull and put the trailing arms, which would
&gt; probably be in the $200-300 range, plus $200 for rebuilding the arms, for
&gt; a total cost of ~$400-500.
&gt;
&gt; The more work you do, the less it costs, but you are trading time for
&gt; money (aren't we all? :-)
