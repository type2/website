I had a similar problem and it was a failing electronic ingnition.  Other
symptoms were short cutting out while driving on the freeway; stalling.
Replaced it and all has been fine since.

&gt;&gt;&gt;My '81 Vanagon has been having some problems (cold) starting after its
&gt;&gt;&gt;winter storage...  the engine turns over fine, but within a couple of
&gt;&gt;&gt;seconds it just dies.  After five or six tries, the engine will idle very
&gt;&gt;&gt;low for about 10 seconds, then rev up to normal idle speed.  Once the
&gt;&gt;&gt;engine is warm, this problem disappears.  I've searched previous digests
&gt;&gt;&gt;for similar symptoms (although I couldn't seem to find this exact
&gt;&gt;&gt;problem)... here is what I've come up with:
