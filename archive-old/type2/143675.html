Subject: New engine won't start

Dear all

I recently replaced my single port to a reconditioned dual port engine.  After many hours of swapping plugs resetting points and timing; checking the fuel pump, carb and numerous other checks, I can't get the thing to start.  Fuel is getting to the carb and leaving the carb, however the plugs look fairly dry to me?  I have a healthy spark on each plug also.  The compression feels okay when turned at the pulley

any ideas
