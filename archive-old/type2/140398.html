Subject: [T2] Bad hesitation and huge flat spot right after rebuild...

Hey guys and gals, I just took my 2.0 litre FI engine out of my '78 bus...  I
had bad compression in #3..   I replaced the 3/4
head and took off the 1/2 head to inspect and clean up with new gaskets....
Got everything pretty and replaced all of my FI
fuel lines and cleaned EVERYTHING....   The FI was reassembled and I put on
new vacuum lines to boot, I also used clamps for the vacuum lines......   All
of the other parts were put on and thge engine was installed....   After
finding I had missed 1 wire, she fired right up....  :-)    The test drive was
a bit disappointing....   I had NO power in the lower half of every gear....
After you got over the flat spot she seems better, but you have to give it
extra gas at every gear change or it bogs way down....  It sorta feels to me
that the timing is retarded, but its not...  Same thing with 2
distributors....   wu wu wuu wuuu wuuaa wuuuaaaahhhh waaaaaaaaaaaaaahh
is what it seems like, you get very little umph until you are halfway through
the gear, then when you change, you have to give it extra gas and kinda ride
the clutch or it will act like its in a pool of glue.....

I have a 2.0 running a 009 and stock fuel injection.......  I have it timed at
28 BTDC and the Dwell is at 42 - The valves I set to 1.5 turns in after
touching...( did it while engine was out)
[u]
While I was trying to track down my first issue that I pulled the engine to
fix, I replaced these parts......[/u]

Fuel filter
plugs
plug wires
points, cap, rotor
battery
some vacuum lines
got 35 lbs in the fuel system

[u]In the head replacement time, I[/u]

replaced all fuel lines in the FI system
replaced the FI boots on the manifold
replaced all the injector seals
replaced 3/4 head with a rebuilt one
new head gaskets both sides
new intake gaskets
new exhaust gaskets
new muffler/tailpipe
new vapor lines in gas tank area
new fuel sender


[u]OK, so here is what I have done before asking advice.....[/u]

Replaced the distributor, it had new points in it....
Checked over my brake booster (now I have a vacuum tester tho and will use it
soon...) What should the pressure be at???
Looked for vacuum leaks (only 1 hose is the original, all the others have been
replaced ((and clamps added)), it is in good shape tho)
Pulled of my grounds underneath the air plenum, closed them up and put them on
and off to clean the connector.
Checked that the ECU was plugged in good....
Added $20 of 93 octane gas (the tank had been drained to replace a fuel level
sender....)
Checked the connections on my FI harness, they all seem good except the cold
start valve connector, its a bit loose...Not horrible..

Obviously I am missing something, probably right under my nose... I am VERY
ready to be running again, so any help is appreciated....
I might think of more, but this post is long enough anyway, so thank you in
advance....
I am learning more and more everyday, but Im not quite there yet and need help
to get there....
You all are a great bunch and a good resource, thanks again and hope to hear
from you.....

Aaron
