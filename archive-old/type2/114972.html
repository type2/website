&gt; Pontiac guy.  Anyway, I have the fan that's attached to the crank. I assume
&gt; it's fixed to the crank without any sort of a fan clutch. That fan I'm
&gt; assuming draws OUTSIDE air from UNDERNEATH the car, pulls it THROUGH the oil
&gt; cooler, through that aluminum tubing in front of the motor (which is two
&gt; cast pieces of aluminum bolted together... draws it through the fan, and out
&gt; the back of the engine compartment towards that little vent area.

The fan speed is the same as the engine speed. Cool air is drawn in from the
outside via the vents at the top rear corners of the body. The engine
compartment needs to be sealed to keep surrounding air heated by the exhaust
from entering the fan.

The air is blown over the oil cooler and each cylinder. Pieces of tin exist
to direct the air over engine parts.

&gt; I'm thinking... I'd really like to install a set of fans.. maybe one over
&gt; each cyl head (so two..) They would be spaced maybe a couple inches from the
&gt; cyl head, and I could rig it up so that when I notice the cyl head
&gt; temperatures getting too high, I could switch on the fans and it would cool
&gt; it.. right? Would this disrupt the original air flow design of the motor?

This seems overly complicated. There are tricks that performance engines use
to drastically lower the CHT (Porsche style fans, Aluminum cylinders, etc)
but the costs are prohibitive.

If your driving style drives the temps too high you either need to slow down
or build a cooler engine from the start.

&gt; Also, how do I know what kind of amps my alternator has?

The visual test for the original alternator was the 70A model had fan blades
on the pulley otherwise you had a 55A model. Not sure what a new 70A looks
like.
