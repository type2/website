Subject: Odd noises from 82 Westy
Date: Fri, 5 Feb 1999 21:25:57 -0600

Happy Weekend All!

My westy has KYB's all the way around and they seem to be in good shape. 
She rides great and does the correct dance when I step on the fender and
release.  The thing that puzzles me is this:  When I drive up and down my
gravel driveway, I hear popping noises that are without question coming
from the suspension.  What is causing this and is it serious?

Another question!  When I start it up after it has been sitting for a
couple of days, there arises such a clatter from the engine.  This lasts
6-10 seconds until my oil light goes out.  Do the products like Slick-50
really help protect the engine during the start-up period and, if they do,
will they help quiet this horrid noise?

Peace,
Erich Elmer

P.S. Is anybody aware of a similar list for beetles?

82 Westy - Blue Eyes
74 Super - Nikki
57 Beetle - Bessie

&quot;If I get home before midnight, I just might get some sleep tonight&quot;
