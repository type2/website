Hi Shawn,

Thanks for the input.  Its either the pressure regulator or the check valve on the
output side of the electric fuel pump.  Or one of the five injectors.  I just want to
try different approaches to diagnosing the various causes and find the quick, accurate,
and simple way.  There has got to be many ways.  I may just have too much time on my
hands.
