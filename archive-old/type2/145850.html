&gt; Courtney,, your from the old school... lol  there is no such thing as 
&gt; electrons...
&gt; electric circuits are run by smoke and sparks.
&gt; 
&gt; If you let the smoke out of an electronic circuit,, you can count on it 
&gt; never working again.
&gt; I bet you have never seen an electron fall out of a receptacle ,,,, but you 
&gt; might have seen sparks and smoke!
