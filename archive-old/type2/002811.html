X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hi All,

In trying to figure out why my signals weren't working,
I discovered my left front turn signal housing is pretty
much rotted away.

IF anyone has a turn signal housing for a 1971 Westy,
the long, rectangular style, please ping me privately.
I live in the Northwest and with the rain season here
I really would like to get this replaced.

Thanks,

Pete
