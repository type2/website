&gt;I liked the design of the one shown in the above link (the mounting method
&gt;is absolutely brilliant!), but I had an improvement in mind. So I called the
&gt;manufacturer and asked them to do a minor rework for me. They had a version
&gt;that added a small mesh pouch between the two cup holders for a cell phone.

Ron, can I suggest one more improvement for your next run? If it would not 
hurt the rigidity and stability too much, could they cut a notch down each 
side to accommodate a coffee mug handle? Most of my &quot;car cups&quot; have handles 
and I am always looking for a good cup holder that will hold a cup with a 
handle.

I may still buy one as soon as I move to Florida. Having a cool drink 
nearby is a survival issue there...
