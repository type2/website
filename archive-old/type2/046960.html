&gt; Actually I am a classical music aficionado, and I don't think that annoying
&gt; the neighbours is in my gameplan. The bous from the 'hood would probably run
&gt; the other way if they heard classical music!!

In which case you may want to visit the high end room. I think you could
make a fine listening room for chamber music in the back of a Loaf.
