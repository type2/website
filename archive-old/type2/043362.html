Subject: Engine Seal

I just was wondering which side do you recommend faces up on the engine 
seal. I jsut got a new one today and am going to install it tonight and 
there is one side that appears to be rubber coted and on side that is almost 
like foam. I assume the rubber part faces inside the engine 
compartment....correct???


cheers.....
