Subject: Re: [T2] burning bus on COPS

&gt;&gt; Could you create a small tank and then plumb it to
&gt;&gt; the air cleaner where the fumes would be carried
&gt;&gt; into the engine and burned?

&gt; I'm not sure that would be safe.  Thoughts anybody?
&gt; KR

I'm sure most are aware that this is exactly what the original system is 
designed to do. Vent  are necessary to remove gas vapor pressure which 
changes dramatically do to temp and pressure changes, etc. These vent lines 
carry the vary dangerous gas fumes through a charcoal filled canister which 
cleans out some stuff (?chemists?) then that vapor is pulled into the air 
cleaner for combustion via vacuum from the fan housing. This is done on both 
type 1 and 4 engines.
