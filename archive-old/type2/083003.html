Hi guys, 
&gt;&gt; Still worried about oil pressure though. Took it out for a 12 mile run
&gt;&gt; to try to get it broke in this evning. As long as I hit all 4 gears when
&gt;&gt; accelerating it had reasonable power. Oil temp got up around 200 degrees
&gt;&gt; while driving on moderately hilly road at 50 to 55 mph. As long as revs
&gt;&gt; were up oil pressure stayed around 20 to 25. but when I slowed down or
&gt;&gt; stopped the pressure would drop and wink the oil light. I have a VDO
&gt;&gt; pressure sender and gauge. I think the light contact closes at 8 psi.
&gt;&gt; I'm using Valvoline 30 wt oil. While rebuilding the engine I was


&gt;I'm running 5-50 synthetic (very thin) in my rebuilt 2 liter after about
&gt;15k it is still pumping 65psi at startup and at idle and running at 230F
&gt;it will still be holding 30psi

230F is pretty warm isn't it?

I admit that I'm running a celcius guage &amp; that it goes into the red over 125C, but before I got the Celcius guage, my mechanic, who built the 2.0l I run which has done just over 15,000kms, told me that 220F wasn't a real happy place to be for long engine life &amp; that the engine was only likely to build up that sort of heat on hot days.

What sort of ambient temps are you driving in......80-90F or more?

I'm interested, because my engine seems to be on the edge of the red on long trips, even in temperate weather at speeds between 60 &amp; 70mph, at around 3600rpm.

I never have had problems with oil pressure though, with the exception of cold starts, when the light winks a little until the engine's been running about a minute with generous pumps on the accelerator pedal.

I have noticed that the gearbox crunches in 1st when she's very cold though.

Any hints there?
