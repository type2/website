Subject: [friday] Regarding &quot;Deadhead/hippie&quot; buses...

Y'know... I've been thinking about this whole &quot;Deadhead/hippie&quot; bus
thing for the better part of today. And the more I think about it, the
more I realize that if it weren't for the &quot;hippie&quot; acceptance of the VW
bus, the bus today would be no more popular (or interesting) than an
old Ford/Chevy/Dodge/whatever van.

Now don't get me wrong... buses have a hell of a lot more going for
them than that -- there's the relationship to the Beetle; the
beauty/simplicity/genius of the whole air-cooled thing; the functional-
yet-stylish-in-a-quirky-way design; etc., etc....

However...

How many of you -- especially those of you who own those beautiful
original condition stock/resto buses -- have *never* had your bus
referred to as a &quot;hippie van&quot; or &quot;hippie bus&quot;. I'll bet any money there
isn't a single person on this list whose bus has *not* been called
a &quot;hippie&quot; whatever by *someone*. So why is that? Could it be that
the &quot;hippie&quot; culture of the 60s/70s saw something good in the bus that
John/Jane Q. Normal would never understand? Could it be that many of
the John/Jane Q. Normal crowd of the 60s/70s are now
considered &quot;hippyish&quot; today, even though they may be Republicans?

I guess what I'm trying to say here is that if it weren't for the
overwhelming popularity of the VW bus amongst the &quot;hippie&quot; (or should I
say &quot;hip&quot;) crowd back in the day, the bus today would be nowhere near
as special in the public eye. There isn't a day that goes by that I
drive my bus anywhere without someone flashing me the peace sign -- and
I haven't even got to my &quot;hippie&quot; paint job yet.

Anyways, think about it. Maybe if it weren't for the hippies (and
Deadheads), your bus might be as special as a &quot;K&quot; car.

Later,
