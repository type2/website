Any thoughts on this? &gt;&gt;

Darrin,

Be VERY careful about using a universal bug/ghia towbar that has been 
&quot;adapted&quot; in any way to tow a bus.

The beetle/ghia towbar was designed to tow an 1800 lb car with some built in 
&quot;safety&quot; margin.

Be certain you have somehow determined that your 3300 lb westfalia is within 
that &quot;safety&quot; margin before you pull it anywhere!!
