Subject: Re: [T2] FYI: &quot;Buses by the Depot&quot;, campout in PA, next to the
  Ron's Busdepot

&gt; FYI: Chris Turner (JordanVW, as known on the vanagon list) is
&gt; &quot;organizing&quot; a campout. The following is the info:
&gt;
&gt; ---------------------
&gt; Subject: its official &quot;BUSES by the DEPOT&quot; vw van get-together sat Oct 14th
&gt;           Green Lane PA
&gt;
&gt; well it's &quot;official&quot;....this event will be called &quot;Buses by the Depot&quot; not
&gt; only because of its close proximity to Busdepot_dot_com, (Ron approved the event
&gt; name) but there is alot of old railroad history in that area.. ive traveled

&gt; FUBAR)  and take reservations, then ron said he would stop by the park and
&gt; reserve a bunch of adjoining spots once paid reservations are confirmed.. (he
&gt; lives right by the park, i live 20-30 mins away from it)
&gt; so anyway, the reservation thing would be up to you all..
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; we need more people to attend!    if your planning on attending, please
&gt; p-mail me w. your name and what van you'll be bringing, and if you
&gt; plan on camping
&gt; so i can give ron an idea of the turnout..
&gt; chris

great idea but so close to the John Browns Buses get together in Maryland.
will have to see how the bus runs, not sure if I can make it because of
taking off of work two Sundays that close together.  if I make it will
have to be Sat only....  Bob,  78 auto tranny low floor bus
