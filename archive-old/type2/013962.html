suggestions on what it should look like would be
helpful. Thanks!

&gt; you mention to pass
&gt; out!
&gt; Coming back from Indy last weekend, it would have
&gt; been kewl to stop the
&gt; three other Bays I saw and hand them a flier.
&gt; 
&gt; No Baker, we didn't pass where I could have waived,
&gt; they were all parked
&gt; along the way.    :)

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hello List,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well it is Friday. I had a Friday Question. I have
&gt; &gt; seen many bay window busses lately in town. A
&gt; couple
&gt; &gt; of these busses were for sale, some needed some
&gt; TLC
&gt; &gt; and a one or two were restored, beautiful models.
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; think that the owners of these busses could really
&gt; &gt; benifit and/ or contribute to the list. My thought
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; to make up a Type 2 flier that tells what the Type
&gt; 2
&gt; &gt; Websight and Type 2 list is about. I thought that
&gt; &gt; whenever I saw one of these parked busses in
&gt; parking
&gt; &gt; lots or else where, I could stick one of these
&gt; fliers
&gt; &gt; under the busses' windshield wiper. Does this
&gt; sound
&gt; &gt; like a good or bad idea. I would like to see some
&gt; list
&gt; &gt; bus owners from my own town on the list.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Let me know what you think.
