Subject: Cold Start Hesitation Problem

Dear list,

My stock '77 FI has trouble starting when cold (though in Texas that means
around 100F).  When it catches it dies quickly unless I carefully give it
some gas.  Sometimes it won't catch unless I floor the pedal (type 1 no
choke trick).  After 10 seconds or so it runs GREAT.  I don't mind this but
someone buying it may.  I checked everything in the FI troubleshooter -
there's voltage at the cold start valve connector with respect to ground
when cranking.  The thermo time switch side of the cold start valve
connector shows 70ohms to ground.  My temp sensor reads around 900 ohms at
100F ambient (it's not shorted or open).  The only other thing I can think
to check is whether or not the cold start injector is clogged.  Does anyone
else have any ideas?  Thanks in advance!
