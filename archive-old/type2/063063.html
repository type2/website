Subject: On the subject of gas leaks...

I filled up the vanagon the other day and topped off the tank beyond the
normal shutoff which I usually don't do. After paying I noticed a gas smell
and drip in the right wheel well. The visible hoses in the well area seemed
to be saturated and the source of the drip. I gather that there is an
overflow connection and hose at the top of the filler as well as other
plumbing and an expansion tank all in the same vicinity.

Ordinarily I don't have a problem like this and haven't since. Am I correct
to assume that topping off the tank put some gas into seldom used and perhaps
dry rotted hoses? Haynes doesn't deal with this specifically but has a nice
picture with all kinds of plumbing on the topside of the tank that leads me
to think that I need to drop the tank to get to the various connections. 

If it's simple to replace the hoses I'll do it now. If there's wrench turning
involved I'll add it to the later list unless someone tells me I'm at risk of
becoming a fireball. Can someone please advise what I'm facing here? BTW, the
hoses etc are good around the circuit from the tank and back, I just don't
know about these in the vicinity of the tank itself.

Maybe there's an explanation here for my lousy gas mileage (15.5 tops!)
although I don't have a gas odor to suggest leaking.

Thanks,

Weston
