&gt;&gt;    This was refering to the upper cot in the early bay window westy.  I
have one in my 71 and that is where I sleep when camping alone.  Mind you
now, I'm no small guy at 5'10&quot; and 232 lbs., and I feel fine up there.  The
best part is that I don't have to tidy things up downstairs before I can go
to sleep.  &lt;&lt;
