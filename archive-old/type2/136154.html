&gt; It's been about 30F here in WNC the past several days, and I've noticed no

I wonder if the double-relay is properly working? If it isn't starting
running the fuel pump when the key is in the &quot;start&quot; position, then
you are waiting on the engine to turn over enough and open the afm
flap so that the contact that controls the pump works and you have
pressure. Perhaps a quick jumper wire to the pump from a 12v source
before starting tomorrow morning would either confirm or bunk this
theory.
