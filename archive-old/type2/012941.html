Subject: sliding door
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I was checking to make sure my all my door locks
worked on my 71 bus.  I went to lock my sliding door
and it locked fine.  When I went to unlock it, uh oh. 
I can't get it unlocked? Does any one know how I can 
get it unlocked and what is wrong with it?
