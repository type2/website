to be nitpicky typically 1973 westy's had the 4 legged stool 
covered in that ugly one year only butterscotch coloured 
polyester fabric. yellow baby poop coloured naugahide was 
used up to 1972. In 1974 they went crazy with the 
various iterations of plaid fabric and life as we know it 
was never the same

 All the 4 legged
&gt; stools were covered in the beige naugahide (smoothgrain 
vinyl) up until '74 and
&gt; those were plaid covered in either orange plaid, or 
blue/green plaid - standard,
&gt; and deluxe models, respectively.  The reason it is 
referred to as the &quot;4 legged
&gt; stool&quot; is so as to not confuse it with the &quot;console box&quot; 
(the fake wood veneered
&gt; box w/ plaid covered lid offered on the '75-'79 deluxe 

fyi i have seen those console boxes on 1974 westy's 
have never seen a plaid covered four legged stool
