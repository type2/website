Subject: Re: [T2] 73 Westy 5-speed STILL For Sale

This bus is so awesome.   I don't know why anyone has not ponied up the 
cash to buy it.  When I flew out and took over guardianship of Zorm 
(Mike's old 58 SC), he picked me up at the airport in this bus.  If I 
wasn't busy with multiple jobs, full time graduate school, and two 
little kids, I would just go get it myself.

If you have thought to yourself...this is a bus that would be fun.  Go 
buy it.  I promise you will love it.

Shameless plug for this amazing bus...out!

&gt; A few of you know this bus and know that when I say it's solid, not 
&gt; rusted,
&gt; and runs out like no other bus you've seen that I'm not exagerating.  
&gt; I've
&gt; reduced the price from $4000 to $3300 and would still consider offers, 
&gt; but
&gt; nobody seems to be interested.  Am I asking too much?  Are people 
&gt; afraid of
&gt; the tranny conversion?  Are they afraid of the d-jet FI?  Any input or
&gt; suggestions as to why this bus is not selling would be greatly 
&gt; appreciated.
