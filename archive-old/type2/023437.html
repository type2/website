&gt; After walking my hiney off yesterday, I find the SEMA show a success. I will

I also attended my first SEMA show last week.  I found quite a bit of new 
stuff to add to my product line, but only for the Vanagon and EuroVan crowd.  
Glad to hear that there were some parts suppliers with aircooled stuff as 
well.  I think I'll stick with the tents and accessories for now and leave 
the parts to guys like Ronnie.

There was a lot of cool stuff to see there.  The New Beetle has now been out 
customized by the PT Cruiser.  If I get some time this week, I'll post pics 
of the show to my website.

I was pretty sore when I got back to my hotel room after the show.  I must 
have walked 20 miles trying to see it all in one day.
