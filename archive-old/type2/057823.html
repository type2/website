Subject: exhaust manifold studs

Hello List!
I'm knee deep in an engine swap and I unfortunately busted off a few studs
for the heater boxes/cylinder heads. (79 2.0L).  I stole a couple off a
junk motor I had laying around (1.8L), but they really weren't the greatest
so I was wondering where can get new ones of  these?  One end is 8mm x 1.25
thread and the fatter end is ??mm x 1.25 thread. Like not quite 10mm dia.
but larger than 8mm?!?!?!?  I was hoping to buy a stainless socket head cap
screw and stick in there to get me by until I find the real deal, but I'm
afraid of stretching out that oddball sized tapped hole in the head.....
List- What should I do??  Also, any advice on extracting those busted off
studs on my good engine??? 
As always, thank you all graciously in advance for your advice.
