Subject: Re: [T2] Starter Relay Switch on a 77 Westy

Anton,

??????????

Buses, and most VW's(unless added by an owner) do not have starter 
&quot;relay's&quot;.

The starter consists of a &quot;motor&quot;(the starter) and a solenoid.  The 
solenoid causes the motor to engage the flywheel gears when power is 
applied to the starter through the switch.

When the power is off, the starter gear is disengaged from the flywheel 
gears andthe motor turns off.

The starter is bolted to the transmission with two bolts on the passenger 
side of the bus.

The doghouse(on pre 72 models) is the type of fan shroud that sits on the 
top of the engine and holds the fan(and alternator) and inside of 
that(bolted to the engine, the oil cooler).  &quot;Doghouse&quot; refers to the 
specific fan shroud made for late model oil coolers that have a place to 
exhaust hot air from the oil cooler.

American cars generally have a starter relay, but not buses.

Hope that helps, dave

&gt; Thanks all!
&gt; 
&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, but on the 77, is the starter up on the 
&gt; doghouse like on our 69?

&gt; &gt; It's piggy backed on the starter.
