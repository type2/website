Subject: electric fuel pump?
Message-Id: &lt;v01530500b3a01de6df5b_at_[204.221.85.38]&gt;

        Hi, has anyone used an electric fuel pump on their bus?  I have one
on my bus right now (rebuilding 1776cc engine), and was just wondering if I
should keep it on there or go back to a stock one?

Thanks in advance,
