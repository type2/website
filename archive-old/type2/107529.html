&gt;
&gt; My van will not start - the starter goes, but nothing else.

-Just to make sure we're communicating properly: you're saying that the
-starter spins, the engine turns over, but the engine won't start?

Correct.

-There are 2 &quot;spade&quot; connectors on the solenoid.  There's a stout &quot;free
-floating&quot; red and black wire to one and a blue wire (that goes into a
-harness bundle) on the other.  Then there are 3 wires that connect to a
bolt
-on the solenoid with a nut holding them in place.  I believe that second
-wire (blue, or maybe blue/brown?) actually connects to the combi relay;
-without that wire attached, the van certainly won't start.

is the &quot;stout &quot;free-floating&quot; red and black wire&quot; referring to the ignition
switch wire?

Yes, according to Bentley that goes to the ignition wire switch.

I will refer only to wires not on the bolt (those are fine):
The wire that heads from the relay to the starter comes out of a wire
housing sheath about 1 foot from the starter - the double wire that is not
attached to anything is also coming out of this sheath.  Should this
'double wire with 1 female spade fitting' also be attached to the soleniod?

It's completely dark outside so I can't go look at my setup.  Offhand, I
can't remember a &quot;double wire with 1 female spade fitting&quot; coming out of the
sheath, and if the 2 spades on the solenoid are fully occupied, then I can't
think of where it goes.  Are both spades occupied?  What are the colors of
the two wires that go into the female fitting?

Right now the starter turns, but no fuel pump and no power to the
injectors.

That suggests the combi relay isn't getting power.
