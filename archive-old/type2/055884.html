Subject: Oil Filters &amp; Heads

I did check the &quot;sermons&quot; and BH says he uses Fram, but our local 
autoparts guy can't cross match the VW 021-115-351A oil filter I am using 
in the &quot;Magic&quot;bus (72 with a CB 1800cc engine in it).  My local VW guy 
wants to sell me the &quot;genuine thing&quot; claiming Fram has a different flow 
rate and will crap out my motor.  He wants $14 for the VW filter btw.

So can anyone tell me Which Fram to buy?

Point #2 (nothing in the Sermons on this, except that BH has long silky 
surfer hair???)  Some of us have such great looking heads, we don't need 
a lot of hair to hide them.  The only problem is when spending a day or 
two IN the motor compartment of the &quot;Magic&quot;bus, I come away looking like 
I stuck my head in mulcher.  Touques are time honoured headgear up here 
in the &quot;true north strong and semi-free&quot; but at summer temps. not 
comfortable.  Helmets are out, not enough room.  Who has solved this one?
