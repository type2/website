&gt;I am very new at this, so hopefully you all won't find this too 
&gt;elementary to respond to.  I just bought a '67 bus a few weeks ago and 
&gt;noticed that the oil light flickered on when I started the motor.  I 
&gt;checked the oil and found that it was full (a little over full actually) 
&gt;but pretty dirty.  Today I decided to change the oil.  After removing the 
&gt;oil drain bolt and the oil fill cap, the oil just dripped out of the 
&gt;drain like mollasses.  I decided to take out the plate that covers the 
&gt;oil screen, thinking the screen might have been really clogged up.  Upon 
&gt;removing the plate, a bizarre air-filter like apparatus with a bearing (?!)
and 
&gt;spring fell out.  This didn't look anything like the oil screen I had 
&gt;bought at BAP, so I took both back to the store.  They said that what I 
&gt;pulled out of the motor was garbage, and the weird, apparantly home made 
&gt;oil filter was probably restricting oil flow and causing the oil light 
&gt;flickering.  Feeling re-assured, I chucked the old filter-thing and went 
&gt;home to put on the new one.  Unfortunately, the new screen would not 
&gt;easily push into place.  I'm guessing that the hole in the center of the 
&gt;screen is suppossed to be pushed onto the pipe in the motor, but it just 
&gt;doesn't seem like it wants to go.  I tried hammering on it but I ended up 
&gt;distorting the filter without really squeezing it into place.  Tommorrow 
&gt;morning I'm going to buy a second filter, but before I bash it up again, 
&gt;could anyone give me any hints about how to make this go more smoothly?  
&gt;If this question seems too elementary to answer on the list, I'd sure 
&gt;appreciate a personal reply.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

Hello Matthew,

I am unfamiliar with whatever doo-hickey was in there before, but I
can add a little info your way that may help.  While it's not super-
critical for the oil screen to be perfectly tight on that pipe...It
IS critical that you change your oil often, especially if it hasn't
been changed on a regular basis in the past.  I would change it
again as soon as it gets brown.  And again as soon as it gets brown,
etc. 

It will also help a great deal to get a magnetic oil drain plug. This
will pick up any small bits of metal that would otherwise love to
chew up your engine.  Sounds like your VW was rather forgiving about
this !  I clean my screen every other change - wash it out with gas.
My current rebuilt from GEX is (fingers crossed) so far not tossing
me bits 'o metal, and the oil is beginning to stay clean for a while.

Have you ever heard about a VW owner who changed his oil and adjusted
his valves too much ?  

Good Luck !
