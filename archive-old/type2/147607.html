&gt; I went back to the shop and gave them the numbers I was given for the
&gt; CORRECT set. The set I was given is VW number 021-198-009A, but B

&gt; the correct set. They pulled it up and saw that was the set they  
&gt; thought
&gt; they gave me.

021-198-009B 72-73
029-198-009 74-75 1.8L, 78 2.0L
071-198-009 79 Bus, Vanagon air
025-198-009 Vanagon waterleaker
039-198-009 914 2L

&gt; But they didn't have one.
&gt;
&gt; But the counter guys were adamant about there being 1.7 head  
&gt; gaskets in
&gt; there and opened the package themselves. Yep. 1.7 and 1.8 gaskets.

If you look at my gasket set article you'll see that the 1.8 and 2L  
oval gasket set includes head gaskets for the 1.7L. This seems to be  
because they make up the set from smaller packets.
