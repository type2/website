Renoir here,
I don't have 68, but if they like my rear drum brakes you would not have to
pull anything,
just change shoes. On my 71 front disk, in order to pull off  the rotor i
use an
ALLEN wrench, a specialty hex wrench, you can get a set at any auto supply
or
home depot. Have you read the archives?

Hope this helps.
