This is a 3-terminal flasher.

Headlight dimmer relay.  4-terminal.  This one might be a bit hard to
find.  I just had to replace one and had to kludge a 5-terminal relay to
do the same job by installing a jumper.

&gt; and 111 951 307B.

I don't know this one, but if it came off of the bottom of the fuse block
like the other two it might be a buzzer
