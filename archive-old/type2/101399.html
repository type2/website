Subject: Re: [T2] some bad AP3 cams out there

Dan,

Assuming this is for a t1 engine since I haven't heard of those cams
since the early 70's?

Cheers, dave

&gt; I had a engine built by a local shop. we installed a AP3 cam. it went flat

&gt; 3 oil changes. the owner has had all three of the engines he built with his 
&gt; last shipment of 5 cams(he still has 2) come back. mine ground the crank so 
&gt; bad it started leaking around the pully. he has been using these cams since 
&gt; the early 80's with no bad results. he recieved the bad 5 early last year.he 
&gt; is waiting to hear from his supplier. he is gonna build me another one with 
&gt; a engle 100 or scat cam. hope this info helps someone else.
