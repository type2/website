Subject: Re: [T2] front end problem


recently put a whole new front end on my 78,  really nice beam from
BustedBus torsion bars, torsion arms, new ball joints.  reused my spindles
and tierods.  got new drag link

problem is when I went out Wed last to a place I use regularly to get the
front end aligned, (Hunter electronic, even had the spec's in the computer
for her)  They could not get the left front all the way to spec, very
close only off by 1' but that was as far as the eccentric would go.

other side went right into align.  now one book (pocket guide) says to do
it &quot;unladen&quot; while Bentley says to align it with just a tank of fuel no
other weight.  in any case it had a pretty good load in the van including
the drop floor. when he jacked it up the front came in the little bit and
just came into spec.

I checked out all of the reused components and everthing was to spec...so
this has got me really scratching my head.

any thoughts?!
thanks

Bob
