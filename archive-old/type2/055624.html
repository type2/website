Subject: Followup on Engine Noises (longish)

Good Folks,

A while back, I posted query regarding an engine noise I was
experiencing with my freshly built 2.0 liter, hydraulic type IV engine.
After following the Mark Stephens bleed-down procedure posted to this
list by another user (thanks, BTW), it was still making the noise.
Different weight oils didn't seem to make any difference for it either
(please don't respond with more oil talk!).  I peered in at the pushrod
end of the lifters while I still had the engine in the bus, but didn't
discern anything amiss.  After letting the bus sit undriven for a about
a month, I just pulled the engine and took off the top end.  I found the
problem; and it's not an oil or air problem.  I don't know how I missed
it when I inspected the lifters while they were still IN the engine, but
the #1 intake lifter's wire retainer clip has popped out on one side, so
that it is still in the lifter, but with one end of the wire is hanging
loose.  Now that I have it out of the engine, I can see that the cam
lobe surface of the lifter has uneven wear (I can't see any visible
abnormality on the cam lobe, but ....).  I just wrote Web Cam Inc. (the
source of my hyd cam and lifters) requesting instructions as to &quot;my
options&quot; regarding this presumably defective lifter.  I'm thinking that
it is highly likely that the problem lifter is the source of my noise,
but I've noticed some other possible anomalies, also:
-    There were metal flecks in the oil under the valve cover (the noise
was on the right).
-    There appears to have been some leakage where the #1 cylinder meets
the head, and maybe some shuffling there too.  (The cylinder is one I
had fretted about when I installed it, because the sealing surface was
higher on its inside edge than on the outside edge.  BTW, the P&amp;C set
were a $199 asian product I got from MSHP).
-    After I had the top end off, but before I discovered the problem
lifter, I spent some time hand turning the crank, and listening, and I'm
not sure what I should be hearing.  Clearly, giving the crank some back
and forth movement (clockwise/counter-clockwise), I should be hearing
the lash between the gear on the crank and its mate on the camshaft,
right?  But that noise should be the same throughout the rotation, I
presume; but it's not.
    At this point, I guess I'm about ready to split the case and have a
look, and to clean.  If I don't find a metal fleck source there, I guess
the heads will need to be disassembled for further inspection.  In
regards to this, I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice on
how to make this task easier.  The last time I tried it, I first tried
using a borrowed C-clamp type valve spring compressor, only to find that
even with the best fitting attachment, it had improper clearance and
threatened to gouge the valve cover sealing surface.  I eventually used
a borrowed two-armed puller style compressor (with two arms and a screw
type action).  However, this left me with so little maneuvering room
that I wasn't able to get the keepers back in to reassemble the heads,
and had to give the whole package to my local machine shop guy to
reassemble -- which I hate to do, because I want to do this myself, and
because he always seems to screw things up (this time, ignoring my
written instructions, he forgot to install the stem seals).   I've seen
those lever type apparatuses the VW magazine type places sell for the
Type I heads.  Are these available for T4 heads too?

Thanks much for listening.  Please let me know if you have any info for
me.
