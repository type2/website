&gt; I have used 205/70R14 tires for many years but not goodyears (Michelins)

Another consideration is the fragile steering boxes in early Bay buses.  I
wouldn't put a wider than stock tire on a 68-72 bay because of the added
turning force required to steer when not moving.  Those boxes aren't
cheap!
