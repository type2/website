Hey Mike, everyone,

Yeah, I'm using it as my daily driver.  But since you ask, mine is not
really a hot start problem.  It's a *warm start* problem.  [This is a
stock 78 FI'd Type IV.]

If engine is cold, it kicks right over.

If engine is at normal operating temp (N.O.T.), it kicks right over.

If engine was at N.O.T., but has been cooling an hour or so, crank,
crank, crank, no fire.  Really makes going shopping interesting.  If
I let it sit for four hours after N.O.T., it kicks right over.

It's that one-hour cool-down, where the engine is at some intermediate
temperature, that seems to be the problem.

Anyone got any ideas?  I'm thinking Temp Sensor II is showing age,
maybe its resistance curve is off--min and max values are OK, but
intermediate values occur at wrong time during warm up.  Is that a
known problem with those NTC sensors as they get older?  Anything
else it could be?

Thanks,
Rodney
