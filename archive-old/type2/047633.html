Subject: [T2] transmission compatibility

I've tried to find the answer to this question in the
archives, but haven't located anything specific.

We have a '75 bus with 1.8L engine. I gather from the
archives that the '75 was a one year only bus with regards
to some aspects of the transmission. Does that mean a
replacement transmission would have to be a '75? We may have
a lead on a good low mileage '76 (they think) transmission.
The mechanic who would be making the exchange is an
excellent mechanic and machinist, but isn't positive about
the compatibility. 

Any thoughts and suggestions appreciated.
