Subject: Seattle- VW Toys

Ahoy!

I am broke so I couldn't buy 'em, but the Salvation Army store on 2nd Ave.
by the Kingdome has about 100 assorted VW models and toys for sale.  Many
Vitesse busses in their original packaging, wide assortment of firetrucks,
police vans, ambulances, surf busses etc.  Also many Beetle and KG's.  They
are in &quot;Sally's Attic&quot; which is a sort of boutique within the main store
where they put the pricey antiquey stuff.  I am so bummin' I'm broke but
list members ought to get in there!  It looks like some local collector must
have quit collecting, or passed away and had their stuff donated.  Happy
hunting let me know if you score!

BTW, anyone see the story of the guy who just sold his pink prototype
Hotwheels surfer bus (one of a kind) for $72,000.00?  Damn!
