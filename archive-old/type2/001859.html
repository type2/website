Well usually wise and all	 knowing listies

This is a friday question for ya
Well i must say i am torn as to what to do about shows this summer. I am in
Saskatoon Sask, Canada (right smack dab in the middle) and really want to
head to busses by the falls in niagra falls ontario june 22 , 23 , 24,  but
as luck would have it the 25th would be my girlfriends lil bro's grade 12
grad. So my request to the list is to please ease my troubled mind and tell
me what good shows we could attend in late july or august sometime, within a
reasonable distance of home.
thanks all

Scott B. Loucks
