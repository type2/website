Subject: [T2] VW Trademarks/more info

here is a link to part of the copyrights that VW has, thanks to Everett (VW
PLANET) for getting it up so quick

http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/legal/vws.htm

I also talked to the copyright attorney after all the interest in this and
he said go ahead and post a link to his site, this doesn't pertain to VW but
will give you insight on copyright laws. He also told me that he will post a
supreme court ruling against VW and any other information he comes up with.
After I told him of all the interest in this it got him fired up to do a
little more research on the subject. He's a VW owner but not a bus owner.
