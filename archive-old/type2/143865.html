Subject: Re: [T2] Busted clocked?

The little metal disk that snaps around as the magnetic relay energizes. This is the heart of the clock, it's what &quot;winds the spring&quot; (it actually IS the spring, if you ask me). Anyway, it had come out of its position. When I first put it back, I had it opposite the way it should have gone in. Once I figured this out (and resoldered the fusible connection to the realy, common breakage point), it fired right up. There are a couple of good sites that have hints and pictures of the Kienzle-VDO clocks that we have in our  veedubs.
