Subject: Brake Booster ?

Hello everyone. The other night I was pulling out the AC unit(Yes it is for 
sale complete system) from my bus when I started looking at the Brake 
booster. I wanted to check the Vacuum line to make sure it was tight while I 
was under there. I pulled, it gave. It did not take much effort. My question 
is:

...on the nipple that the Vacuum Line connects to, on the rear of the 
booster...

Is there a bushing or seal or something that goes between the hose and the 
nipple? It looked as if there were remnants of something there and it is 
loose. It doen't seem that the rigid plastic hose would create a great seal 
for vacuum puposes.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
