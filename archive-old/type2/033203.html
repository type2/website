Subject: what defines bus sag?

I checked the online library, Bentley and VW's late bus shop manual, but did
not see the answer.  The procedure tells us the check the angle of the
spring plate relative to the body, but it doesn't tell us what the bus's
angle to the road should be. I don't think I should go by the book and plate
angle alone since (1) the rear is heavier than stock and (2) the torsion
bars probably got &quot;softer&quot; with age. I just want to know if the suspension
on my bus needs to be adjusted or not.

With the heavier flat-6 in the back, my bus sags *slightly*: I measured 1.5
to 2 degrees. Is this within normal bounds or should it be perfectly level?

Can also someone confirm if my calculation is correct, at least in
principle? If the distance between front and rear axis is, say, 5 times that
of the distance between torsion bar and rear axis (I didn't measure that:
I'm in my office and making up numbers... as usual :-), then the plate would
have to be adjusted by (roughly) 7.5 to 10 degrees (5 times 1.5, resp. 2),
no?

Thanks,

Sami
