Subject: '54 Status

Been a while since I gave an update on the '54.  Between the
last two shows, and the whole convertible-saga, I've been
motivated to work on it.

For the most parts, its been collecting dust.  I do have
the driver's side panel off andhave been working on test-fitting
the new piece.  I have a new front passenger side frame
piece fabricated - the one that goes up toward the beam -
and am ready to cut the one out of the bus and weld in both
new ones.

Once I get these two frame pieces in, the major work on the frame is
done.  I have a couple sections in the very front to 
work on, but they aren't that large.  My next step was to put
brake lines in, put in some wires and the motor, and
see what happens.  believe it or not, I'm fairly close to having
a running barndoor, albeit one of the uglier ones.

At kelly park there was a guy witha '52 that was very, very
crusty, but he drove it up from LA.  If he can do it, so can I!
