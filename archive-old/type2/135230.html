Subject: Re: [T2] Pimp My Ride on M-TV

  The ceiling in my shop is 12 feet tall and my cross bar lift fits fine (about 3 inchs from the roof). Depending on where and how I 
set the feet I can lift a westy (any year) all the way up. My garage at home I built with 14 feet inside ceilings, I want an extra 
height lift that are now available to get under them better. I prefer the crossbar verses the floor crossover lifts due to the fact 
that the cables etc. on the ground make it a pain to move stuff over it and is in the way if on a creeper under it.
  Also with the extra height I was able to build a loft/mezzinine along one side and the back wall to store stuff, I just with I would 
have built it bigger as it is allready full.

&gt; Bus Questions:
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have the height of a 73 westy with pop top? I am building a garage
&gt;and looking at a car lift. I was going to put in a low profile lift with no
&gt;beam going over the lift so that the bus would not have clearance issues. Then
&gt;I found a different lift, with the overhead crossbeam, for a much cheaper
&gt;price. I just want to make sure that the bus will not hit the cross beam when lifted.
&gt; 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt;Is this a Rotary lift? If yes, my 77 poptop Westy fits under the crossbar and goes all
&gt;the way up without hitting it. The Rotary also has a safety bar just below the crossbar
&gt;with a microswitch on it, if you hit the safety bar the lift stops rising. It stops before you hit 
&gt;the crossbar. You might check what safety features your new one is offering if it is 
&gt;not a Rotary.
