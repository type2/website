Hi Volks,
    An oxygen sensor works quite well as a tool to tune the mixture.  You
must use a LCD meter to read the voltage.  A reading above 0.5 volts is rich
a reading below 0.5 volts is lean. The oxygen sensor can be placed anywhere
in the exhaust before the catalytic converter.   A heated ego works better
when  the sensor is not near the head.  I installed a heated one after the
muffler.  The list vendors have bosch generic sensors in 1 wire and 3 wires.
On the 3 wire sensors  the white wires are for the heater, just hook it to
the coil plus and ground.  Black wire is plus oxygen sensor out put. If you
use a 4 wire sensor the gray wire is minus oxygen sensor output, other wires
same as 3 wire.
    With an oxygen sensor you can tune afm spring tension at about 3k rpm
and the afm by pass screw at idle.  Works great,  I was  tuning a 78
national westy so much I installed  an 81 California ecu and ignition,
thanks Karl. With the  79-83.5 California L-Jetronic the ecu keeps the
mixture tuned to perfection.
