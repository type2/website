Subject: RE: [T2] Mexico says adios to beloved VW van

&gt; so does this mean that parts will become harder to
&gt; obtain, and/or more expensive???


Eventually it will mean that some parts become either more expensive,
unavailable, or available only in the aftermarket - but not for a while. For
at least a short while longer, VW/Brazil (who made the &quot;Mexican&quot; bus for the
last several years) will continue to make the Bus for the Brazilian market,
as that version is not &quot;officially&quot; discontinued yet. (They sell an
aircooled version in Brazil, not the watercooled version that they exported
to Mexico.)  And then for some time further they will continue to support
both the Mexican and Brazilian markets with replacement parts. But they will
gradually discontinue parts as demand decreases; there is less incentivefor
them to support a model with replacement parts when they are no longer
trying to sell new vehicles of that model. Look at the U.S. market as an
example. When VW discontinued sales of the Bus here in 1979, parts
availablility didn't suffer instantly, or even a few years later for that
matter.  But by 1990, a great many part numbers had gone obsolete.

Then again, this was inevitable; it was just a matter of time.  They weren't
going to sell the Bus forever.  Just as VW/Mexico discontinued the Beetle
when they started making the New Beetle there, the handwriting was on the
wall for the Brazilian Bus over a year ago when VW/Brazil started tooling up
to make the Eurovan there.

Heck, 50 years is a pretty long life cycle for a vehicle. VW should be
proud.
