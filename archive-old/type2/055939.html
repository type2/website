Subject: Thoms '36 horse and paint codes
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

A little while back Thom described a jump from 110 to 180 when oil was added 
to the cylinders on compression testing. VW factory specs for rebuilt '36 
horse motors say compression should be 100-110. I guess you could get to 180 
by dumping in a whole lot of oil and thereby decreasing chamber volume. Any 
other ideas? Also I need the paint code for a '54 oval window, it is Grey 
and despite searching the web I have yet to find a site with the codes. Any 
help would be appreciated.
