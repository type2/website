Yesterday I wrote about welding in a new sidepanel for a '81 Vanagon. I now
have the webpage in place.

Here it is: http://www.rustbuster.nl/Bus_zijpaneel/index1.htm (this page is
in English, few words, big pictures)

(Do you like the domain-name ?)

Maybe someone can copy this message to the Vanagon list as I am not
subscribed there anymore.
