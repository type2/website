Subject: Fuel Injection Concerns

------_=_NextPart_001_01C22117.2D4F95B0
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

All of the recent questions about fuel injection has got me wondering about
the FI system on my 75.  All appears to be running well with out any
problems but is there any thing I should be doing to keep it running in top
shape or should I be checking the system as a preventive maintenance item to
find problems I do not know about that may cost $$ down the road.
I know nothing about fuel injection and to date if it hasn't been a problem
I look the other way.
