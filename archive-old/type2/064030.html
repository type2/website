Patrick, Paul, and anyone else going to the Manassas BUG-OUT,

I will be going, and will be camping at the Bull Run Nat'l Park.  No list
sticker, but for those who havve not seen it, I have an Orange '73 w/a
black nose and a blue/white striped pop-top.  By all means stop by Friday
or Saturday night.
