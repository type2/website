Subject: Re: [T2] Living out of a Bus on the road with Kids

  thank you all for your honest and positive answers to a very much QUESTION thats all it was just a question...
  much appreciated honest respectful answers so far... THank you type2 members...
   
  it wasnt if i agreed or not with you but at least you all treated me with fair respect and a answer...
   
  would really be good to hear more accounts like yours here as well MIKe with actual experience or known experience... or even like minded experiences ... yes like the boat doesnt have to be a bus but the question brought to my mind in the conversation was of course about living in the bus with kids... i wasnt sure if it was possible? and we(our friends) all talked about it pros and cons but i only had  and heard from others in a small group (sometimes) its good to hear from a broadband area...
   
  again thanks type2 members for being adults in answering...
  i am not at all being sarcastic but sincere when i say that...
  peace
  chai
   
  very nice site john
