&gt; Hello all, I have two questions.  #1 How can I tell if my 2L motor has

a little &quot;trick&quot; that might help without any disassembly.....take off the
valve covers and push down on the pushrod side of the rocker arm.  a
hydraulic should have some give, the solid will be &quot;solid&quot;.

also look at the top of the push rod, a hyd push rod is solid, a solid
pushrod is &quot;usually&quot; two piece, but this is a less reliable method.

they are ADJUSTED differently too so you need to be sure before adjusting
them.  Hyd are far far better IMO

&gt; rebuilt more than once supposedly.  #2 What rust breaking oils/lubricants
&gt; are you using.  All I ever use is WD-40.  You can pmail me if anyone has
&gt; some amazing stuff their using, I'm not looking to start some sort of debate

yeah I would love to find something that &quot;really&quot; works
