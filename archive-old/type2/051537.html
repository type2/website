&gt; It came out without a hitch.  The most time consuming part was the CV
&gt; joints.  Why are the bolts 12 spline on the tranny and allen on the
&gt; wheel side.

I think we can blame that on the PO. Mine was like this:

Left outer: three allen, three 12-spline
Left inner: six 12-spline
Right inner: one 12-spline, five allen
Right outer: four allen, two 12-spline

Of course, half of the allen head bolts stripped while I was attempting to
remove them. Angle grinders are your friend.
