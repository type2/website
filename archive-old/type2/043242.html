Subject: blowing oil

I've posted this in the past and I want to bring it up one more time. I have 
a lot of oil collecting on the cooling tin inside the engine compartment on 
the left hand side. When I took a drive tonight for an hour or so at 70mph 
the back of the bus is soaked in oil all the way up to the rear window, back 
of hood, and now totally soaked inside. I'm myphed, how is it getting to the 
outside, but more importantly where is it coming from? I guess I need to pull 
the engine (could do it with my eyes closed at this point) and look at the 
oil cooler. Open to ideas. The oil sensor switch has been changed as well as 
the distributor seal.
