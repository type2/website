Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum Leak in Crankcase?

I just went out and mine has just started doing this exact same thing??
when it is at high throttle on the road it runs fine, could probably drive
the interstate for hours as long as I don't need gas or want to eat..

mine is a 78 auto tranny bus, what is yours???

&gt; I've been hunting for this bugger for months. Checking every hose and

&gt; work completely cured the vacuum leak symptoms:
&gt;
&gt; Bucking under light throttle.
&gt; Rough idle.
&gt; No idle when cold.
&gt;
&gt; Today I pulled the hose off the crankcase vent and pinched it. No
&gt; vacuum leak!! The hoses themselves are fine. I've noticed the bus runs
&gt; rough when the oil cap is off, so this makes sense...
&gt;
&gt; I checked the filler cap and neck and the dipstick tube. All appear to be good.
&gt;
&gt; Is the breather supposed to be valved to prevent this?
