Subject: help with hot engine??

OK, , ,
Now I've had the bus long enough to know what questions to ask , , , , , ,

After driving in  town, just a short trip, When shut down, this puppy
is hottr'n a popcorn, , , well, you know.
Actually it's about as hot as if you had driven a water cooled engine
without water.

Smokin' hot!!

I suspect the carb is set too lean.
It's a '72 with single carb.
The tin has large gaps it it, also. Would that be a problem?

Can any one help me out here?
TIA
Ron C.
ps, ,  I think I'll take a quick photo of the engine room and
post it, where you can see it.
