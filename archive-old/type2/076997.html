&lt;&lt; This past year, as Mary Beth and I did over 21,000 miles of Western US, 
Canada, and Alaska in Casper, I discovered quite a few old buses parked out 
in abandoned house locations, on small lonely roadways going through small 
towns way out in nowhere, etc. &gt;&gt;

Comin' through NJ soon?
If you're up to it, how 'bout a note to the list when you come across a 
&quot;find&quot;?
And on a similar note...A while back, I kept passing a bike leaning against a
wall in a back yard. I left a note on it saying I was interested...Talked to a
neighbor and left another note in the mailbox of the purported owner...
Couple weeks later, I notice the bike's gone. I ask the neighbor what hap-
pened...Seems the owner wasn't paying the rent on the apartment and left
rather hurriedly one night leaving quite a bit of &quot;stuff&quot;...The landlord hired
some local help and they &quot;threw&quot; the bike into a dumpster along with the con-
tents of the apartment...The bike? Norton Commando 8-(
