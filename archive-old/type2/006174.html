Just got back from 1800 mile &quot;emergency&quot; trip from WNC to above Philly and
surrounds (trip report next Friday).....so I've not yet caught up on the
messages: this may have been mentioned, but we own the NEATO book (tho no
splittie :), that has coded info on a lot of volunteers as discussed here.
People offer a whole range of aid to those in distress...or just needing a
beer. May have needed some info/help this last week.....except I had
internet access to KVS..thanks, Karl. Had I needed parts sources, etc..there
were quite a few listings in Penna.

Maybe a similar list booklet would be helpful. Or just a download. If this
has been covered in an earlier digest..excuse the bandwidth.

Marv Krupp...finally back home with the 71 SC in one (running) piece.
