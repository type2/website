Subject: Re: heater box recirculation

&gt;anybody feel like actually forwarding a copy
&gt;of the post in question, please?

There were two or three posts, the second or latter two of which came 
with a promise to post a URL. But the first post had this information:

&gt;From GMBulley_at_aol_dot_com 9/1/98
------------------------------------------------
EXCELLENT HEAT: exhaust is wrapped in RaceTec? fiberglass insulating tape
(more heat is released in exchangers), all heater ductwork insulated to
R-4.3, active recirculation ducting (picks up warm air from inside van),
three 300+ cfm blowers, all walls insulated with R-13 insulation and
overwrapped with 3-mil moisture barrier. (During last years blizzard in
Colorado we were in shirt sleves in our van.)
