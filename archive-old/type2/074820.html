Subject: RE: [T2] Belly pans?

Hello folks,

The early campers had these belly pans. The early campers where simply the
regular chassis with the roof cut for the pop top. This seriously
compromised the structural integrity. Therefore they decided to weld the
pans for some added torsional rigidity. I think '71 they added some
structural members to the roof and eliminated the belly pan.

We do not have any at this time. I have one customer on the waiting list.

Subject: [T2] Belly pans?


Somebody recently mentioned to me that he was looking for a belly pan for
his bus. I, too, looked for such a thing when I first got mine, but was told
by several mechanics that no such thing existed. This gentleman I've been
talking to said he'd hear that &quot;68-72's had
&gt;them, but it might have been the '60-70's.&quot; He also said he'd heard that
&gt;those belly pans had problems rusting. Does anybody else have some input on
&gt;this? I'd love to get something under there to protect the mechanics of the
&gt;bus, even if it would rust away itself.
