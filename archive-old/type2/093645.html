&lt;&lt; C'mon! Buy it! Such a bargain at that price. Talk about a crazy toy! A VW

pimpmobile! I'm near Santa Barbara and maybe I could pick it up for you! I'd

love to see reports of it's road adventures on line. Now THIS is something

that I might consider living in, but it would be hard to be discreet about

it. LOL. Jan B

Has everyone noticed that the people who are most enthusiastic about
this VW are also enthusiastic about someone else buying it...?-)
