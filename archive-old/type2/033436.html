And now a word from the other Nikki!

I got my bus like I get most of my boyfriends -- the right one just
sorta happened when I wasn't looking. My bus is great, and her name's
Wendelin (which, like Peregrine, also means &quot;wanderer&quot;).

I was downtown last night and saw about five buses in a two-block
radius. I just want to hug every one of them I see. I'm not sure why.

And here I thought I was sublimating! ;-) Naw, I'm just another VW
nut....

It'll be interesting to see what happens when I start dating again. No
offense to the other Nikki, but &quot;love me, love my bus&quot; (and my cats,
etc.).

TGIF,

Nikki
