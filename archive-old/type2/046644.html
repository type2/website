Subject: Re: [T2] Need PN for VW sodium filled valve, HELP?

&gt;If anyone knows, please tell me.  I have only seen Porsche 2.0
&gt;and Vanagon sodiums from VW and those are generally flat
&gt;faced with the little 1/8&quot; divot in the center for the sodium, these
&gt;do NOT appear to be that way, looking instead like any ole valve.

I have a set of 1.7 sodium-filled valves, and they have the divits in the
center.  I thought they all had to have the divit.  Then again, mine are
TRW #390360, not OE VW.
