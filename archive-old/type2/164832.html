Subject: OG 1600 DP Engine

Got a 71 Westy with original 1600 DP Engine with 68k miles on it. Looks to be
all complete, has the dashpot (what the bleep does that thing do) , original
dizzy, altitude adjuster, thermostat, bosch coil,  even has a German Fuel
Pump. I was going to take the carb off to clean it then  I started to realize
all the hoses and things connected to it. I might just pull the engine and
store it , have a new one built from the ground up OR would you pull this
engine out and rebuild it. Remove the dashpot, the dizzy, altitude stuff and
install an alternator and SVDA.
Thoughts on options:

1.) Store and build a new one
2.) Pull the engine and rebuild it ( keeping all the good parts)

I expect it's time for a rebuild ..... I've had a few people tell me 75k miles
is about the average you can expect in a bus.
