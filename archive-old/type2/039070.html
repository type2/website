i must agree with the posts so far, try and keep it.  
i know how &quot;SO&quot;'s can be about our obsessions, but
hopefully you can work it out and maybe find her a
cheap but reliable used car while you still cruise in
the good ole bus.   those good ol japanese imports are
everywhere and seem to run forever.   if you sell it
now, you'll just be &quot;what if&quot;ing yourself for years to
come.   my father in law still talks about his brand
new green MG that he sold when my mother in law got
pregnant with my wife:) that he had to sell and wishes
how he still had it.   hang on to it if you can.
hope it all works out, and congrats on the baby!

&gt;      If possible, keep the bus.  It is a great
&gt; family car &amp; my kids loved
&gt; them as they grew up.  My son thinks this is what he
&gt; wants for his first
&gt; car.  Very easy to secure the car seats in most any
&gt; bus.
