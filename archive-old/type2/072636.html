Subject: greasing the shift rod tube
Message-Id: &lt;v0151010cb357cc198cc9_at_[207.172.52.115]&gt;

I found a neat way to uniformly grease the entire length of the shift rod
tube in my '71 Westy.

I happened to have a large diameter brush like the ones used to clean test
tubes in chem lab. (Doesn't everyone?)  The diameter fit the ID of the tube
perfectly. I attached a six foot length of #6 wire to the ring on the end
of the brush and could both push and pull the brush through the tube.

I smeared chassis lube on the brush and made several passes through.

After instaling the rod, the gear shift lever is a pleasure to move.

One tiny problem.  A year ago, I bought a set of three plastic bushings
&gt;from  Jim Thompson at Sherwood Automotive. Today, I went to press these
onto the rod and they didn't fit.  The diameter of the plastic nubs that
engage  holes in the rod was too large. Rather than drill the rod holes, I
slipped the old bushings back on and used the two new ones at intermediate
points along the rod, making a total of four on my rod.  A Dremel tool
easily removed the nubs. This improvement was suggested by Chris Chubb and
others. Thanks,

Jack
