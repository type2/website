  I will have to smog my Bus one more time before it 
becomes exempt


Will you have to pass the dyno testing procedure? your test this year or 
next? has anyone gotten their bus over the BAR-97 smog check? I know it's 
been in place in LA for a while... I wonder if the EGR is necessary to 
passing (assuming you can find a technician who doesn't care about the 
visual inspection).

Also, if the current law holds up, our 75 is now exempt from smog checks. 
Does anyone know how threatened that law is? the most recent info i found 
seemed to be a few months old. Our legislators are probably more worried 
about their pay checks than our air quality.
