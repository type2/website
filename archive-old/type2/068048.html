Subject: Selling CA Bus out of state???

Hi,

I am selling a VW Camper and had an offer from someone in AZ.  I =
discovered that the previous owner removed the catalytic convertor from =
my bus got it smogged (somehow) before selling it to me and now has =
stuck me between a rock and a hard place.  In CA, the owner must smog =
the vehicle before selling it.  So I'm not sure I could get it smogged =
(even with a new convertor, since the regulations just became =
draconian).  I'm assuming that VW's of that era were convertor-less in =
the 49 states.  (Confirmations on that assumption???).  Anyhow my main =
question is....are there any special procedures to selling a vehicle =
from one state to a person in another?  i.e. Do I need a smog =
certificate from CA before selling it, what paperwork is necessary, etc. =
 Any help would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

Ivan
