Subject: Re: [T2] really rough idle, shaking whole bus

Hi Jeremiah,

I am working on a local bus with a shudder at idle that will violently 
shake an open door.  Try pulling off spark plug wires from the 
distributor while the bus is running. You are VERY likely to find  one 
plug wire that has no effect on the idle.... The problem is then 
identified with that cylinder. Pull the plug and check the electrode... 
If you have a known good plug on hand put that in its place. Try 
swapping the injector leads with the other cylinder on that side. If 
that doesn't work then pull the injector and check the spray pattern. 
Then check the valves and check compression on all 4 cylinders.

The local bus I refer to turned out to have a problem in the valve 
train. This afternoon I should find out if it's the lifter or the 
camshaft that is the problem.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
