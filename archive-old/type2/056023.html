Subject: Re: '79 idle low where's EGR Valve?

&gt;The original question, I believe, was &quot;Where is it?&quot;  The Bently manual 
says that it will trigger the light automatically every 30,000 miles, 
but it didn't help me find the thing.
&gt;
&gt;Where is it and what does it look like?
&gt;

OK you are confusing terminology.  There are two separate and distinct 
things, neither of which have anything to do with the other.

First there is the EGR valve.  This can be found in the engine 
compartment on the front left side of the air distribution box.  There 
is a linkage connecting it to the throttle valve.  This does not trigger 
any lights.

Secondly there is the mileage counter.  This thing can be found forward 
of the left side kick panel inside the Bus, and in line with the 
speedometer cable.  This baby counts the miles and every 30K it turns on 
the EGR light.  You then remove the kick panel and reset the light.  
This has nothing to do with the EGR valve.
