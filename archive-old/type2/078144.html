Subject: Sioux Falls mechanic


&quot;and finally...in case i have to suck it up and take it
to someone.._dot_can anyone recommend a good aircooled
mechanic in the eastern part of south dakota OR in
omaha, nebraska (my next stop.)&quot;


Hi Missy.....This is not a recommendation....I've never used him, never 
heard anything good or bad, but have stopped in there.....If I were in your 
shoes....I'd consider Lacey's, 1321 E 39 St N, Sioux Falls,
605 335 7704. That's near Cliff and Benson, NE side of town. I'll put this 
on the list as well, maybe someone else has some experience w Lacey and will 
comment.

Best wishes
