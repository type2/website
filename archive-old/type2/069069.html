Subject: The horn saga continues...

Well, folks, this has been a true learning experience so far. Only problem
is, I'm not exactly sure what I'm learning. As of 9:24pm CST Saturday, the
horn, when connected, beeps incessantly when the key is turned on. 

Here's what I did today-
I removed the steering column and disconnected the linkage at the bottom
that goes to the steering box. Found that the wire that runs down the center
of the steering column really *does* come out the bottom, it's just well
hidden. Replaced the wire that runs through the steering column with a new
one. Reconnected steering column to steering box, etc., etc.. Turned key,
horn blows incessantly.

Now I'm really thinking about this. Let me give you an idea of this circuit.
From the horn, the ground wire goes into a bundle of wires which disappears.
Maybe it goes to the fuse box. Next time I see a ground wire is in
approximately the same place, where it seemingly returns from the fuse box.
It then plugs into a spade connector at the base of the steering column
tube. Now we head up to the horn button, where we see another wire plugged
into a spade connector on the horn ring. That wire goes down the center of
the steering column, and comes out at the bottom, where it grounds out at
the steering box.

Here's some tests I did:
1. Ran a jumper wire from the ground terminal of the horn to the spade
connector at the base of the steering tube. Horn blew incessantly.
2. Ran a jumper wire from the ground terminal of the horn to the spade
connector in the horn button. Horn worked perfectly.
3. Replaced wire in steering column and reconected in normal fashion. Horn
blew incessantly.
4. Ran jumper wire from ground terminal on horn to screw at base of steering
tube, and disconnected spade connector at base of steering tube. Horn blew
incessantly.

Now, folks, there's not too many more places to check. At this point, I'm
starting to wonder how I can &quot;improve&quot; on this circuit. Any ideas from the
electically astute?
