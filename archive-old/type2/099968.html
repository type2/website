Subject: RE: [T2] CV Boots

I dont know if you have a Autozone  in your area but I picked up the whole
axel with boots and all for $40.00 it was much easier than having to mess
with new boots, the sameone has been on my bus for 1 1/2 yrs with no
problem. just a thought. I usualy dont mess with them but I was in a bind
and nobody else had the joint that i needed so my wife just by chance called
them i told her there was no way thay would have it, well I was wrong it was
instock! good luck
