&gt; &gt; take the heat exchangers off and replace them with muffler pipe? Will this

&gt; 
&gt; yes you can replace with &quot;J&quot; tube
&gt; no it doesn't affect the performancee
&gt;  make sure the cooling system is intact
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; otherwise it will make the engine unbalanced. I don't need the heat cause I
&gt; 
&gt; weight it would be unbalanced, I would take both off, (in fact I have on
&gt; my bus) those things are heavy
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; only drive the bus in the summer anyways.
