Subject: [T2] Parts/SC possibly FS in central Fla

SO and I joined yet another VW (in mid-Fla) club last night, and one of the 
active members has a huge storehouse of parts further south in the state. 
Seems to be able to get about anything you can imagine. I'll try to get a 
listing from him and make it available. Also going to look at a cheap SC he 
has for sale..and a type3 KG...like I need either one. Actually, after the 
divorce I won't be able to afford either...:(

Marv Krupp..way too old for so many projects..

'74 Westphakia, '72 Hightop, '71 SC, '69 KG, '68 DC, '63 Notch, and a 
temporary 71 camper....and now a 79 Suburx Brat...mit wasserboxer...:(
