Subject: all this discussion about brake  lights

All right...who do i blame for this..
my brakes were fine until i started reading about  brake lights.
Was headed over to  one of my favorite VW places  and my brake  light 
was
starting to flicker at  me.  Pulled in to  her  shop and put my foot 
down on the pedal and felt the slow soft drop.  Instead of the couple 
small item i went in for i  also now  have a new ATE master cylinder. 
Hopefully it will be the usual VW repair  with minimal skinned knuckles 
  and headaches.
