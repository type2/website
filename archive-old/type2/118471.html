Subject: distributor source

Well, I am getting ready to start the rebuild on my 71 Westy's engine (type 1
dual port) and would like to change from the 009 Bosch distributor that's
currently there.  I've read through the archives and note that the 009 is not
the favorite among the list but every time I do search or look at the VW part
sources on line, the 009 seems to be the only available.  I was wonder about
other distributors and possible sources.
Thanks in advance
