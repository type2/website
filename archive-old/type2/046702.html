A.    The book is a blast to read.  Some of the most entertaining bits are
about their travails in locating and &quot;modifying&quot; junkyard materials.
[locating and modifying junkyard materials is _clearly_ &quot;OBC&quot;]

B.    Some claim that the famous Northern Exposure episode that involved a
huge catapult, a large piano, and a lake was &quot;inspired by&quot; this book.

FWIW.....
