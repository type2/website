&gt; Yes I am with you there I have already started the FI round up. Question for 
&gt; you is that the Auto does not use the vacuum line, but the standard does? 

no the old auto uses a vacuum line for shifting, the other vacuum lines
are all the same. the 010 tranny does not have the extra vacuum line to
the tranny

&gt; Then in my search for FI should I be hasty about the system I buy and look 
&gt; specifically for a setup from a 77 Automatic? Or does this make a difference 
&gt; in regaurds to Vacuum?

try for the 77 auto but most seem to work, and I have a bunch of ECU's out
in the garage I could check to see if I have a 77auto box
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;you should have at least one vacuum line to the brake booster,  the 77auto
&gt; 
&gt; Is this the thick line from the intake manifold, centered and just below the 
&gt; carb? It leaves the engine compartment at the drivers side and goes toward 
&gt; the front of the bus.

yup
