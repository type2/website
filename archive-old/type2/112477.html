Subject: Fuel injection

All this talk about fuel injection has me wondering if I should try to put the 
FI off of my old 79 onto my 76. I have all the parts (except air flow meter is 
broken). My question is what to do about the bracket that holds the air 
cleaner. The PO cut it out and there is nothing there?
