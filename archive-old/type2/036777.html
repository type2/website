Chris writes of his new bus:

&gt;A 1970, ugly beigish color ....

Kudos on getting your first bus. In time, you will learn much about the 
mechanics and lore of type 2s. First lesson: you know that &quot;ugly&quot; beigish 
color? If it's the stock paint, you have a classic VW color on your 
hands. Go have a look at the back cover of Laurence Meredith's _Original 
VW Bus_ (Bay View Books, 1997). There's the color, albeit on a 1969 bus. 
I like that color on a bus, and I wager that upwards of 50 people, at 
least, on this list have a bus in that color. Far from ugly, many of us 
consider it quite fetchin'.
