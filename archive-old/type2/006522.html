&gt; I also wonder (but certainly don't want to test) the tendency of the bus
&gt; to overturn with stickier tires.  The coefficient of friction of painted
&gt; metal on asphalt is very low...

	I'm pretty sure that even with moderate tires, on clean dry
pavement,
	a bus would overturn before it slid?
	I know that all my 510 Datsuns, and Toyota Tercel always came up
	onto three wheels before they slid, even without rad tires. Several
workmates
	swear they've seen me on two wheels several times in my old Tercel.
	I'm not sure I'd be able to detect the transition from three to two.
Four to 
	three is quite obvious. I know the Tercel didn't have much in the
way of
	suspension, but one of the 510's was fairly tricked out, which would
actually
	increase its tendency to overturn. 
	I've never had my bus slide, but when I have pushed it, felt that
you quickly get to 
	the no weight on the inside tires stage. I didn't want to push it
further, because
	if the sidewalls rolled up next, then it would quickly get out of
the sunny side up mode of operation!!

	Note I'm assuming you are driving correctly, and giving the
suspension time to load up in the transitions 
	into a corner. If you try to turn faster than the body will roll, it
is a different story.

	Maybe this discussion should be moved to alt.slalom or something?
