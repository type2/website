Subject: heating ducts question

Hey listers,

  The heating ducts on my 71 seem to not close all the way when I put the
sliders at the top; the flow seems only to lessen from the amount of heated
air flowing at the max position. That in itself isn't so bad, but now I'm
getting some exhaust fume smells coming up through the heating vents and
before I have a chance to troubleshoot that problem it'd be nice to breathe,
too. I've heard there are some flaps which could be adjusted... where/how??

  Thanks all!

Peter
