&gt; I've often wondered if those skylights (standee windows) could be put in a 
&gt; bay....

&gt; Bob

If you search the Samba Gallery you should be able to find a picture or two 
of the skylights fitted into a bay roof ( I think it was there I saw them), 
lot of work and as you've alluded to already you'll need to find the seals, 
and IMHO they didn't look that great on the bay roof.

For me, personally, the REAL &quot;must have&quot; items are the old ( pre '64 ) 
Deluxe corner windows and big window hatch, which is why I've got plans 
(dreams?) to fit them onto the DC custom I'm trying to build 
(http://neale_dot_org/type2.html#yeti)
