Subject: weber identification

volks,

I need to identify the set of dual weber carbs which are installed on a 
friends bus, and i'm having problems doing so.

Here's what I know:

a) 1973, type-IV
b) dual weber carbs (they have the big W on the side)
c) they're similar in size to the stock dual solexes

Specifically, i need a rebuild kit or two because while checking the 
float level on one of the carbs, the top gasket (which was hard as a 
rock) ripped.

Any idea on steps to correctly identify these so I can pick up a 
rebuild kit and perhaps tune them?  (now that a friend just bought a 
carb-sync tool)

thanks,
     t
