Subject: old air cleaner with Weber carbs?

I am running a set of Weber 34 ICTcarbs on my 73 bus.  I like them a lot, 
but I hate the crappy little air filters that go with them that get gunked 
up and have to be cleaned with a toothbrush and mineral spirits every so 
often.  I much preferred the old air cleaner with its modern, replaceable 
filter.  Also the old air cleaner was set up to connect with the crank case 
breather and the charcoal cannister filter.  I have no idea what to do with 
these without the air cleaner. So my questions... Can the old air cleaner be 
modified to fit with the Weber carbs?  If not, where can I connect the 
charcoal cannister and crankcase breather so they can continue to work their 
magic?  Help always appreciated,

James
