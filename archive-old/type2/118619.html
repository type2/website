Mike,

Tom Wilson, in his &quot;How to Rebuild VW Engines&quot; book recommends removing the
shipping lubricant by scrubbing in hot water/mild detergent with a soft
brush, rinsing in hot water, drying and coating with assembly lube. This
would be for both pistons and cylinder walls. The book says that is not
necessary to remove the rings to do this. The machinist that works on my VW
engines does the same thing.

Happy Holidays,
Bill Moon

| I am installing new pistons and cylinders and I think the guy at Rimco
| (machine shop) said not to oil the pistons when installing them.  He
| said that they'd break in better.
|
| any thoughts on this?
|
| thanks,
| Mike
