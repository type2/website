Subject: Re: [T2] Just found out something really cool about my bus...

&gt;From: Jason Thorpe Since you're building them yourself, design a &quot;quick 
&gt;release&quot; so they
&gt;can be easily removed whenever you need to haul sheets.


Make the bulk of the hardware attached to the cabinet so it is gone when the 
cabinets are.
