Subject: Re: [T2] OT: garage of dreams

Back in 1991, when a buddy and I wanted to start a VW street repair business
called The Motor Hole (we had cards printed up I still have some let me know
if you want one)we watched the auctions alot. One day we saw Newark
International Airport was auctioning off all it's abandoned cars in a lot of
about 100 cars. There were 4 VW bugs in that lot so we waited and called in
after the auction and found the junkyard that won the bit. It was in the
Ironbound section of Newark.

We took his 69 bus down there one day and bought 4 the four bug motors for
$100 apiece to start our business. When we
were done pulling the motors the boys took us in back to an old barn that
was locked up. Inside was a scene much like
these pictures, a collection of about 40 dusty old classics in mint
condition - now these were strictly from the 20s through 40s, I remember
some Stutz and some Auburns. These were clearly a personal collection not
for parting out or anything like that. I didn't see any Morgan's in there,
but then again I had no idea what I was looking at. Tony you're in New
Jersey maybe this is worth a trip down to Ironbound?
