&gt; I need to order a bunch of replacement sheet metal panels for my '73 Westy.
&gt; I have the Rocky Mountain Motorworks catalog which lists all the parts that
&gt; I need, but I was wondering if there's another company that carries the same
&gt; quality panels, but for a better price? If so, do they offer a printed or
&gt; online catalog?

check out the Bus Depot,   www.busdepot_dot_com
