Guten Morgen!

I just started pulling apart an engine (2L GE) out of my '79 camper, I retired with a bad rod bearing (at least that is what I thought) knock.
Turned out that Piston and Cylinder #2 are pretty badly scratched up. I haven't split the case yet, but I expect to find a really bad #2 rod bearing. According to the PO the last rebuild (including new large valve heads) was done less than 20K miles ago.

Now my question is whether I should replace only P&amp;C #2 or the entire set.

If I get an entire new set I was thinking about doing some mods:
- Has anyone experience with Big Bore sets on Typ4 engines? I was thinking about a 103mm set resulting in 2.4L displacement.
- Bus Boys has a 96mm set resulting in 2.05L - any experience with that?
- Is such an increase in displacement compatible with the stock (79 Cal) FI?
- What is the hottest cam I can run with hydraulic lifters and FI?
- I have '74 heads; are these valves big enough for a high compression (9:1, maybe higher) 2.4L or do I need custom heads?
- Are there any other exhaust systems than the '79 Cal system that provide for an O2 sensor?

Cheers,
Marcus
