Subject: Auto trans in 79 Westy
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Hey volks,
     I have the chance to purchase a 79 Westy with an auto trans. Trans works 
fine per the present owner. Before I road trip to look at this thing, I am 
looking for opinions on the automatics in these. I have no experience with a 
bus automatic, only the cheesy &quot;autostick&quot; bug trannies. 
   Any opinions appreciated on whether this would be a good purchase, 
assuming the rest of the bus is OK? I realize that I will be sacrificing 
power due to the trans. being an automatic- wondering more about reliability 
than anything else. Of course I will make sure it shifts fine presently and 
fluid looks OK. 
   Thank you for any advice,
   Brian
