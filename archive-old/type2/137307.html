&gt;Bought a 1973 westy recently, knowing it needed major motor work. I thought
&gt;1973 should be 1.7 with dual carbs. This one has been converted to Webber
&gt;progressive set up. But when taking motor apart I noticed on the outboard side
&gt;of each inlet port where capped studs ( about 10 mm) that screwed into case.

These are injection ports that were blocked when the PO removed the air pump. It was meant to pump fresh air into the exhaust the help burn the unburned mixture (aka afterburning to reduce emissions).
