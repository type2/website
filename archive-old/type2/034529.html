Hi Wade!

I am no expert, but your problem may be as simple as your timing being too
far advanced. After fumbling around with my '73 with stock 1700 which had
been laid up for a couple of years (the carbs were a mess), I finally got
her going but with the same symptoms you described. A check of the timing
revealed it was at 5 BTDC. I retarded the timing to 7.5 ATDC _at_ 900RPM with
vacuum/retard connected per specs with strobe. She's running fine now
although I still have some carb issues. Your '74's timing is actually set
at 10 ATDC. Anyway check the timing, it's simple enough.
