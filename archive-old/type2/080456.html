Dear Jack.

Which switching pressure do you want; there are four of which I am aware!? I 
don't have details here at the public library, but I can look them up at 
home.

Consider using the 0.9 + or - 0.15 BAR supplementary oil-pressure switch, 
from a water-cooled, gasoline engined VW Vanagon, referred to in the Haynes 
workshop manual.

I also have some ideas for using the 1.8 + or - 0.2 BAR supplementary 
oil-pressure switch, from some other water-cooled VW-Audi cars, but I need 
help from someone with an electronic circuit design background.

In summary, these cars have a circuit, whereby a buzzer sounds if the oil 
pressure drops below 1.8 BAR, when the engine speed exceeds 2,000 RPM (or 
some RPM of one's choice).

This would be very useful for all the air-cooled VWs!

Regards.

        Nigel A. Skeet

&gt;Does anyone know what the VDO part number is for
&gt;the VW oil pressure sender that includes a terminal
&gt;connection for an idiot light?
