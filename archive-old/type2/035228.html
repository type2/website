Subject: how i got my bus

last friday, when i subscribed, i announced that i was getting a '69 westy. 
it turned out to be a pretty long story, but i did get it home :)
heres the link to it on my website:

http://greenaway.mbz_dot_org/bpp.htm

(more info on my bus page, /bus.htm , instead of /bbp.htm)
im just finishing moving the site from -.homepage_dot_com to -.mbz_dot_org
so theres still a few quirks, like the karmann ghia emblem where a vw one 
should go...

enjoy!
