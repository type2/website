Subject: RE: Sliding door rust

&gt;  What can be done about rusted (to the point of nonexistence) lower
&gt; sliding door channels?  Is there some kind of kit or repair piece
available for this?
&gt; Anyone have a donor '77 with a good body for cheap (yeah right)?

I sell a replacement lower sliding door track, for about $120 as I recall.
Danish made. On the website.  Typically takes a week or two to get.  I do
have a '76 Westy in need of paint and minor cosmetics, but runs well (has a
Porsche 914 motor!) for $1850 firm.  This is a California bus and has almost
no rust at all (a bit under the windshield/rear window but that's it).
