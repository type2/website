&gt; 2. Is there any adjustment tricks I can try to increase the spring return
&gt; speed? I don't think increasing the spring tension will do it. It doesn't
&gt; seem to be tight.


here is a guess: could this be a malfunctioning auxiliary air valve?

http://type2_dot_com/bartnik/airreg.htm

other than the blowing test (yeecch!) you can let the engine warm up fully,
hopefully with the speedy idle problem present. then fully clamp off the
hose from the air boot to the valve. if your idle is good, i.e. normal and
lower, then air is getting into the intake through this valve at warm idle.

this valve does nothing unless the throttle is closed, i.e. at idle.  when
the motor is coldly idling it allows extra unmetered air into the plenum -
like a choke. once the engine warms up, the valve should close up
completely, letting almost no air to pass through it.  if it is
malfunctioning, it either will not open enough when cold or won't close up
all the way when the motor is hot. in your case, it may not be closing.

if the test proves you have a faulty one of these, you can try cleaning it
with carb cleaner, or just replace it. they are common to many bosch FI
systems and easy to get at most suppliers.
