Subject: 70 Westy parts

I found a 70 Westy at a wrecking yard here in Fresno, Calif. It is 
mostly all there interior wise. It still has the upper cot frame but no 
canvas material. It has the strangest Westfalia deluxe set-up I've seen. 
It is not a walk-thru. The sink/stove/cooler unit is almost the full 
width. The top of it lifts up and tilts forward like a 76-79 Deluxe 
stove top. It has the wardrobe unit as part of the sink/stove/cooler 
unit and it stands up behind the drivers seat. The drivers side middle 
window is one solid piece of glass. Has a jump seat along the driver 
wall between the wardrobe and bench seat/bed. On this jump seat is the 
support rings for the table leg. The table pivots like a 76-79. The leg 
was gone but the table was there. It's a little rough on one corner and 
has the whiteish top. All the cabinet doors have the white vinyl trim on 
the edges. The inside of the sink/stove top is white laminate [76-79 is 
wood grain].   Anybody want anything from it?
