Subject: Re: [T2] Accident

Jon, and all,

Thanks for all your good advice, it's what I needed.

My insurance has called the witness to take a recorded statement.
They said they will use that to deny the other guy's claim, and also
to try and convince the other insurance co. to make something happen for me.

My company did say they would advocate for me, though their pull is not
binding.

Police report comes out 1/17/06, then we will see what happens with the
claims.

&gt; Give the witness' telephone number and name to the offending party's
&gt; insurance company.

&gt; Your insurance company should also be contacted with the same information

&gt; When they decide to settle (and they will), be sure you mention that your
&gt; vehicle is a &quot;classic vehicle&quot; (+20 to 30 years old in most states) and
&gt; should be replaced at market value. They will most likely hire a classic
&gt; vehicle adjuster to come out and look at your VW.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck and down with liars, cheats and thieves!
&gt;
&gt; Jon
