To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Making a your bus a company car is a great idea, but how does one start a
small busisness? Is is possible to use your bus as an official van for a
musical group and write it off that way? After all a band is a bussiness
(profitable if you are lucky).
Another idea to make the upkeep less expensive is to maybe sell
advertisments and put them on your bus, a bus is a very special vehicle
and people are proned ot look at it. Maybe sell an advertisment to your
parts supplier(VW speciallist), it will target VW fans especially those
who love busses. Possibly work out a deal with your parts supplier to
give you a discont in return for advertising for them (hey it might work).
