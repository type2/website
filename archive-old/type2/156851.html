&gt; 20lt. fuel injected bus  runs and idles fine but as

&gt; mph it dies out.

When it drops speed again, does it take right off? Can
you get past that point and it runs again at higher
speed? Does it do the same at approx same rpm in lower
gears?

Badly worn resistor board in airflow meter? Usually
they just wear a hole right at &quot;normal cruising speed&quot;
and if you get past that it runs and if you back off
slightly it runs.

If it just flat doesn't go over 45, then I suspect low
fuel pressure possibly due to pressure regulator. Try
putting a clamp over the flexible line as it enters
the pressure regulator. Don't clamp it all the way
off, but nearly so. See if you can get over 45 that
way. -BaH
