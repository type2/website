Subject: GL4 or GL5 Mobil 1?

I know that the GL4 and GL5 subject has been brought
up many times but.....

For over 10 years I have been using Mobil 1 Synthetic
gear oil in Every VW transmission I have had, Beetles,
Busses, Rabbits, Golf, Vanagon &amp; vanagon syncro,
Eurovans with no problems. Some of these machines I
put over 100k miles so if there was a problem it would
of poped up.

This is what their web site says:
Mobil 1 Synthetic Gear Lubricant is suitable for all
automotive applications where lubricants meeting
MIL-PRF-2105E, API Service GL-5, are recommended. It
can also be used in rear axles where an API Service
GL-4 lubricant is recommended. It should not be used
in transmissions requiring an engine oil or automatic
transmission fluid, or GL-4 performance level. 

Anyway Have I been lucky or is this stuff OK for VW
use?

I don't have anything to do with Mobil oil or the
Exxon Valdese oil spill!
