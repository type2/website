&gt; I used to live in Redwood Shores back when I worked at Excite_at_Home and 
&gt; can NOT imagine having to do that trip by speed shifting.

hahaha.. I'm guessing you thought I went through the city -  just the 
thought that I could have lost my clutch IN the city freaked me out!  I 
went around and took the richmond bridge!!!  Luckily I was right there 
at the entrance to the bridge so all I had to do was put it in first and 
start the car.  It was still kinda crazy, though.  I didn't know my way 
around the east bay and people were telling me I didn't want to get 
stuck along the way.  I told them it was just my clutch that went out, 
I'd be fine ;)

It was the hayward bridge that freaked me out - having to stop for toll, 
then put it in first, then start the car again and have the toll 
operator look at me all funny.

Turns out the toll operator could care less what I was doing ;)

I did have to get into Belmont, though, and that was not that fun.  I 
had my parents navigate me home the best way that avoided as many 
stoplights as possible.  It was imperative that I did not get stuck 
going uphill at a red light!  If it happened, I was just going to roll 
through the light as it was around midnight anyways.

I finally made it home and shot up the driveway right into the garage 
and pulled out my fried clutch the next day.  Good thing I bought my dad 
a nice floor jack and set of jack stands a year earlier ;)
