Subject: Nitrous Oxide (no VW conten

An observation (no VW Content) to Pat's comment about use of Nitrous Oxide to
dispense beer from a keg ---

&gt;How about if you used no (nitrous oxide) instead of co2?  That THAT would be
&gt;a party!
No, THAT would be Guinness!  :-)  Seriously, Guinness is dispensed in bars
using nitrous oxide, which apparently is what gives it it's unique foamy
quality.  I haven't tried it, but supposedly the Pub Draught Guinness that
comes in the big cans has a nitrous oxide canister in each one.

====================

Very vaugely remembered from a High School Sophomore chem class - whipped
cream in a can, the kind that squirts out of a nozzle, uses NO for exactly
that same reason, it foams well!!!

Anybody for a whipped cream fight ???? :-)
