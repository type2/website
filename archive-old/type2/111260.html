&gt; &gt;Well, not really.. my original point was that the alternator be attached to

&gt; I must have missed the post where you described that - and I was reading pretty closely.
&gt;
&gt; So rather than replacing the stock alternator, now you're talking about
&gt;adding an *additional* alternator inside the engine compartment?  That
&gt;has a whole 'nuther set of complications - primarily, how to drive it.
&gt;But I still think it is unnecessary for 99.9% of bus owners.

I did this on a Chevy truck.  It had a solid-state battery isolator that
went bad, draining the starting battery instead of the camper battery.
The price of a replacement isolator was $80, while the cost of a wrecking
yard alternator (a nice clean one from a Cadillac) was $15.

Now, Chevy made it easy on me because they installed an air pump bracket
on all engines, even those that didn't use an air pump.  The new
alternator dropped right into the bracket, and I fabbed a top bracket from
steel strap.  A longer fan belt completed the mechanical installation.
Electrical was easy too.  Just connect the hot wire and the voltage sense
wire to the auxilary battery.

Camper folks think that the dual alternators are way cool.  I like the
redundancy and the fact that I retained $65!
