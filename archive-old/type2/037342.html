Subject: Using airless sprayers to paint buses

Generally, a lower end airless paint sprayer (i.e. Campbell Hausfield)  is
designed to spray film thicknesses much thicker than you would want to put
on an automobile, and spray much more paint at one time than is practical
for auto painting. (1/3 gallon per minute)  Also, cleanup would be pretty
expensive if using automotive paint, 3-5 gallons of solvent need to be run
through hose after using.  (automotive thinner can be pretty steep, and also
may be too &quot;hot&quot; for the plastic parts on the gun)  Other types of paint
just doesn't really hold up well to bugs, rocks, UV rays, etc.

 THOUGH, if you're not that particular, and you might also use the rig to
paint your house, barn, shop, etc, it might be the better buy.  Keep in mind
it will not spray fibered roof coatings (i.e Kool Seal), and does not spray
latex paint well in weather under 60 degrees.

Better models (1000.00 and up) come with guns that can be fitted with a
metering device and a fine finish tip, that probably would be suitable for
spraying auto paint.

You would come out much cheaper by buying a low end air compressor and low
end cup gun (150-250.00 total) or a lower end high volume low pressure
(HVLP) unit (under 500.00).  I personally think the compressor is the better
buy due to being able to use other tools with it (die grinder, air impact
wrench, air chisel, angle head sander, etc, which all are awesome items to
have for a restoration project) and can air up tires with it.

My 2 pennies worth.
