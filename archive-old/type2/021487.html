Amen to that.  I spent 3 months stumbling around the western states with that
book and paid for ONE campsite.  Drove maybe 25 miles out of the way every
nite, but the privacy and price were well worth it.  We found some GREAT
campsites thru that book.  Definitely pick it up before your trip.

BTW Congratulations and Godspeed!
