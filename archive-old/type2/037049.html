&gt; Dear Folks,

&gt; Mark's idea is a good one, but being a lazy

&gt; old br*llo pads on all my dull looking aluminum

Yep. And an even safer method is to use a scotch-brite
pad....won't scratch the glass. Stick with the real
3-M product and get better results. Still lot's of
elbow-grease no matter how you cut it ;-)
