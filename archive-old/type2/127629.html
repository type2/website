Subject: Re: [T2] Help! Engine won't start :-(

&gt; &gt; The engine was running fine when I removed it for restoring the bus six months
&gt; &gt; ago.  After reinstalling I found the starter, which was fine before removal,
&gt; &gt; now to be bad.  After a new starter the bus now turns over fine the engine
&gt; &gt; just does not fire.
&gt; &gt; I didn't mark the wires when I removed the engine and am now regretting not
&gt; &gt; doing so.  Here are some questions for the experts.

my first guess would be timing or plug wires mixed up.
you have fuel right? and the compression is ok.
