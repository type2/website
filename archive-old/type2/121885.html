Subject: Re: [T2] weber identification

&lt;&lt; Specifically, i need a rebuild kit or two because while checking the 
float level on one of the carbs, the top gasket (which was hard as a 
rock) ripped.

Any idea on steps to correctly identify these so I can pick up a 
rebuild kit and perhaps tune them?  (now that a friend just bought a 
carb-sync tool)

thanks,
