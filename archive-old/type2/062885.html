Subject: Re: Old Tires

Mike Wright and I agreed perfectly about old tires, except where to put the
worst ones.  He says put the bad tires in back, I say front.  I think I
can control the car better steering one tire and one blownout rag, than I
can with the heavy back end trying to spin me into the oncoming lane.

Hope I never get to test my opinion.  Anyone BTDT?
