&gt; My new delemna is trying to find (57mm or 2 1/4 inch) fuel hose for the
&gt; bottom connector to the tank.  I have tried local Boat, Auto and Trucks

&gt; can't seem to find a Gates in my area (Annapolis, Md.)
&gt; Any ideas.
&gt; 

I had the exact same troubles a few months ago.  I bought the top filler connector 
from BusBoys (maybe the last one ;-) but probably not) and hunted high and low for 
the 2 1/4&quot; inside diameter hose for the connection to the tank.  The dealers can 
order this from Germany but they want $150CDN for it here (&quot;it's a very specific 
bend&quot; was their response when asked why it was so much) and it's a special order item 
that apparently takes 6 weeks.

So after going to several truck parts/repair places I finally settled for buying some 
2.25&quot; ID fuel hose from a big hose supply house (the kind reinforced with string, not 
wire, so it is easy to bend into the correct shape) and using this.  Its been 2 or 3 
months and I haven't smelled any gas yet.

FWIW, BusBoys is working on importing the actual OEM part from Germany or Mexico or 
Brasil but Jim told me that I shouldn't hold my breath for this.

Good Luck
