Subject: Procrastination (was Re: valve clicking...)

Alright, that last message I just sent to Rick Diezi was the straw
that broke the camel's back.  I intended it to be a private reply, and
it was annoyingly cc'd to myself THREE times and to the list.  So,
after promising myself for 6 YEARS that I would change the default
reply settings on my mailer, I've finally gone and done it!

This action breaks my second longest procrastination streak (at least,
of the ones I've discovered to date).  About 3 months ago I finally
broke down and bought myself a fingernail clipper, finally honoring a
commitment I'd made myself to stop chewing my fingernails back in the
8th grade--14 years ago!

ObVW: Anyone wanna place bets on how long I can put off the banging CV
joint that's recently beset my bus? ;-)
