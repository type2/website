Subject: Just installed new Westy canvas on a 78 and have a question

This is for a friend that does not have computer access.

He installed the new canvas from Bus Depot (looks nice) but on the front,
where the metal supports push forward at the &quot;elbow&quot; it rubs the canvas and
he is afraid it will rub thru.  Everytime he pops it now he puts a piece of
rubber between the canvas and the &quot;elbow&quot;

Is this how it is supposed to work? Or is the canvas installed wrong or
maybe event the legs bent?

Any ideas on how to correct the problem?

Snoopy
