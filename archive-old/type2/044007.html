Subject: [T2] compression and seal

	I finally got back to working on my 1970, 1600DP Westy this past
weekend. Finished the rear brakes and bled them. Now it stops great. I also
adjusted the valves and checked the compression with my new compression
tester : 130, 125, 130, 138. The only mistake I made was that the engine was
cold when I tested it. Also, while I was in there, I noticed that the
firewall seal is in very tough shape. So, I have the following questions...
1. What effect did checking the engine cold have on my readings ? 
2. Do I have to pull the motor to replace the firewall shield ?
 
Thank You
