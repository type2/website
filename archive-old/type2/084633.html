&gt;I bought a 'Low Mileage' 72 standard bus a couple of years ago, and it was

Very foolish to buy any vehicle without first doing a complete inspection 
to determine what it's REALLY worth. When I bought my 72 T-II with 125k 
original, I knew more about it in an hour's inspection than the seller/2nd 
owner, a lot more.
