Subject: Digitool or Digifant

Hi Volks,

I was rummaging around my computer and found a file
for making the &quot;DigiFant&quot; (Digitool 3.0) tool for
Vanagon fuel injection inspection.  I was wondering,
does this or will this work for the 70's type 2 fuel
injection? I have a type 2 with 76 FI set-up. Will it
connect the same way to the ECU?  If not, does anyone
have plans or diagrams for a tool that can diagnose
Fuel Injection at the Electronic Control Unit?  I sure
would like to have a quick way to check my FI without
having to dig around with a test light.

Thanks,

Rae
