&gt; I have been looking, for sometime now, for those little white
&gt; plastic rings that fit into the aluminum track and allow the curtain
&gt; that covers the window in the sliding door, to slide back and
&gt; forth.  They are small plastic rings with a slotted piece on one
&gt; side that allows them to fit into the track and slide back and forth
&gt; in the track.  Does anyone know of a source for these rings?
&gt; I have sent e-mails to the usual sources with no luck yet..  Thanks.
