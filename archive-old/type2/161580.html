Subject: sunroof drainage

Hello all.

When I hosed off my bus, I got a good reminder this morning that I need to 
fix this before the rains begin: The sunroof drain pipes need to be cleaned 
on my '79 transporter. I have already removed the headliner, and cleaned out 
the plastic hoses that lerad from the sunroof gutter to the drainage 
thinga-ma-doo-hicky. What's the best way to clear debris out of the drainage 
&quot;pipes&quot;? (shop-vac/wire hanger/plumbing snake?) And - where the heck do the 
drain pipes let out?

Thanks!

Stephanie
