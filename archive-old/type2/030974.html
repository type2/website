&gt; I am trying to decide whether the cost of a CW crank is justified by 
&gt; extended engine life.

I was told that a CW crank is most usefull at high RPM and that in the
normal VW ranges under normal driving conditions, balancing the entire
system (crank, rods, pistons) as a unit to within &quot;close&quot; tolerances will
give you most of the benefits of a CW crank for far less money.  remember
a CW crank gives you no advantage unless everthing else is balanced too.

this is a case of diminishing returns, only you can determine at what
point the extra hassle, work and money does not give a decent return on
your investment,   is getting from 150,000 miles to 160,000 miles on an
engine worth the cost and work involved,  (this is an example only not
real numbers).

I think a Good regular crank, balanced and put in properly with a set of
balanced rods and pistons to anything less than 1 gram difference over the
unit will give you 99% of the benefits of a CW crank and 0% tolerance
balance.  but will do it at half the cost.  that was my choice, the engine
is VERY smooth running and that is a sign that it isn't beating itself up,
and I will let you know in another 147,000 miles if it was worth it
