Subject: Steering damper

hey now,

i replaced my steering damper? today...is damper the right word. anyway,
it looks kind of like a shock absorber and is goes from the center of the
tie rods to the passenger side of the bus. quick and easy, about 15 minutes.
makes a lot of difference in the steering also. looks like the old one is the
original one...steering is a lot better now.
