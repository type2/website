Subject: Re: [T2] timing the SVDA

I changed the coil and the distributor (same carb as the PO put on it).
Within the distributor, I changed from points to Compufire electronic
ignition (thats why I got the new coil), installed by Aircooled (so I
couldn't gum it up). I verified the plug wires, and they're correct
(thanks, tho). I probably hosed the idle by modifying the carb settings
after installing the dizzy. The documentation that was sent indicated
7.5BTDC static timing, and then to tweak the carb as necessary. If
pulling the vaccuum hose makes it operate like the 009, then should
timing trend towards the old setting (5ATDC)? I guess I need a little
clarity: what defines the static timing setting, the dizzy or the rest
of the components?
The documentation indicates that the vaccuum diaphram will be stiff for
the first month, and won't be doing a whole lot. This implies that the
new dizzy is already acting an awful lot like an 009. By extension,
then, should I time it like the 009? If my understanding of the library
is correct, the worst I can do if I retard the spark too much is suffer
some poor performance. Alternatively, if I advance it too far, I can
get into some costly engine problems. I'm inclined to reset timing to
5ATDC as per Bentley and Idiot's. If this is throwing a red flag for
someone, please let me know.
I'm starting to think that the documentation is not appropriate for the
type4 motor, but thinking is what gets folks into trouble....
Thanks for your help.

&gt; I believe the only difference between your 009 and your new

&gt; is the vacuum advance and mech timing curve (aircooled specs a
&gt; different 
&gt; curve).  Having said that, it still shouldn't affect your idle
&gt; because 
&gt; neither advance is being used.  You might want to try it without the 
&gt; vacuum line because that will make it run like an 009.
&gt; 
&gt; I would also check to make sure that all of your spark plug cables
&gt; are 
&gt; hooked up correctly.  Sounds stupid, but who knows.  You might also
&gt; want 
&gt; to compare the new distributor to your old one and make sure that
&gt; when 
&gt; the rotors are facing the same direction, the drive cogs are in the
&gt; same 
&gt; orientation.
