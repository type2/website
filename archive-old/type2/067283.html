I heard on the radio that L.A. pollution levels were way down, that this 
year L.A. only had 7 'bad smog' days, may fewer than in past years. It 
was attributed to oxygenated gas.

I know that folks don't like this gas much, but it does seem to help. 
What are the VW symptoms of oxygenated gas? Any ideas about how to tune 
or do other things to make VW engines run better on it?

Jon
