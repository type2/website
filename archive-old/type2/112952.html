Subject: Re: [T2] Jalousie putty

Any RV supply will have the exact same stuff.  RV putty tape. Sometimes 
the original is as good as any modern replacement.  This is one of those 
cases....

Comes in a roll and is sold by the... roll.  Not expensive. Six bucks 
for 30 feet.

&gt;&gt;I'm looking for the putty that was used to seal the seams of the jalousie
&gt;&gt;windows. Anyone know of a modern equivalent?
