Here's what I've done for the last thirty years...

First, clean the valve cover.  I mean *really* clean it.  Get every last
trace of old gasket/sealer off it. Might even be a good time to paint 'em.

Second, put a thin coat of 3M Weatherstrip Adhesive on the sealing
surface of the cover and on one side of the gasket.

Third, go have a coffee.  Take your time. You want the adhesive to dry.

Fourth, place the adhesive coated gasket on the adhesive coated cover.

Fifth, put a thin coating of grease on the surface of the gasket.  I
tend to use chassis lube, others use wheel bearing grease.

Sixth, install using a flashlight to ensure that the cover is properly located.

Last, start engine and check for leaks.
