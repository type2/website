'62 Westy hatch top/bench that is FS in the Phoenix area. Ads just hit
Everett Barnes' VW Planet site.

Mostly original (Pearl white) paint with some cargo side rocker rust. Front
floors and driver's side rockers have been replaced. Mechanically solid with
1600DP and '64-'67 bignutter tranny. Some front end work has been done. New
radial tires. Bus sits at stock height. Both bumpers accounted for. 12v
electricals.

Interior is BITCHEN as far as the camping kit is concerned. Even has the
original Westy decal. Kick/Door panels are original and kind of beat.

I would love to have this bus but just got done with the '63 EZ and need to
focus on other things for awhile. This bus would be a killer driver or start
on a resto.

$4500 firm.

Westy rack is a separate deal-supposedly in fair shape but needs new wood.
Has all clamps.
$400 plus shipping.

Pmail if interested. Both items may be viewed starting Wednesday, April 21,
1999 in Phoenix, AZ.
