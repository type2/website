Subject: Hard Starting Saga Solved

I figured the conundrum out.



Can points just go bad? I could not get my dwell set at 50degrees
although the points looked fine. I swapped in another new set of points
and gapped them to .016. Turn the key and the bus starts. I compared the
set I took out to the one I put in and the looked identical, albeit the
other set a tad bit used from the trip on the weekend. So, if all else
fails put in another new set of points. Crazy crazy buses.
