Subject: Re: [T2] fuel shutoff valve

Hazet makes some clamps in three sizes for this and similar applications. 
See 'em at:

http://www.hazet_dot_de/eng/hits/hits.htm

There's even a video of them in use!

I've used regular small needle nose vise grips for this purpose. Just don't 
tighten them any more than you need to.

&gt;Get needlenose vise-grips, and on a grinder or sanding belt, round the
&gt;edges of the tapers.  Slide rubber tubing or poly tubing over the
&gt;tapers.  This will safely compress the gas line from the tank.  Practise
&gt;on a piece of gas line to determine the minimum pressure required.
