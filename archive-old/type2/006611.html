One more thing worth noting; I have the utmost respect for the companies
that frequent this list, and I routinely send parts sales their way when
they (Ron, Ronnie, etc) are better &quot;tailored&quot; for the request than us (we
carry T-2 parts, but aren't T-2 specialists). So, it's not like I'm trying
to &quot;hog&quot; business.

I sincerely want the best for the list members, and that's why I'm giving my
advice in this case.
