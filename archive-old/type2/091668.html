Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Pump, do I need one?

Concerning air filters. Probably the least expensive and easiest thing to do
would be to install some K &amp; N filters that clamp around the throat of the
carb. A example of what I'm talking about can be see here

oduct_Code=LCF-005&amp;Category_Code=LCF Note: the filter shown probably isn't
the correct size diameter, but it gives you an idea of what I'm talking
about. If you go to the K&amp;N site you can see that they make filters in
almost every configuration possible.

For all the people who are about to flame me, let me digress and say that I
believe oil bath filters are the least restrictive and most efficient
filters that you can put on your vehicle. I'm just giving a recommendation
for quick, easy, and effective.
