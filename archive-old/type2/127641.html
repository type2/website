here is the thing about that. I have that sender, but did not have to
do any modifications to the dipstick. I wonder if the depth of the
sender changed at some time. I've had this one for 3ish years.

i also have the bus depot sender and if i remember correctly all he had to do to the plate was cut a small bit off of the nut on the inside part of the plate. shaved the side of the nut that the sender screws into. We took a trip to the local bolt store to make it possible. if he wouldnt of shaved that side of the nut it wouldnt if went up in there right and bumped into part of the engine.
