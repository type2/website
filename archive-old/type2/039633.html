&gt;I, after mucking around with Neandereer points on my 83, decided to install
&gt;the Pertronix.
&gt;
&gt;Points Suck, as does the FLAPS that sold me a defective condenser. (City
&gt;Foreign Auto, Asheville-NC)

Yes, cheap parts are the responsability of those who sell them, not the
person that buys into the sales pitch.

&gt;
&gt;When I installed the Pertronix, the only variance from the initial setup,
&gt;after timing, was the Dwell. I could not get the same dwell. I did not try
&gt;to adjust the clearance of the ring and igniter, however, because it ran so
&gt;well.
&gt;
&gt;I suspect, as the other gentleman mentioned, that there is a defect in the
&gt;vacuum advance mechanism.

That will make a serious big difference in the overall running of the
motor. Not optional to run without full advance fuction. But if you can
accept non spec dwell, what's a few extra degrees of advance to worry about.
&gt;
&gt;My Pertronix still function perfectly after 6,000 miles.

Except for the dwell, right?

 But I still carry a
&gt;set of points and condenser in the glove box.
&gt;
Yes, indeed, when wizbang fails, fall back up to Neandereering to get you
home fer sur.
