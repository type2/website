Subject: 75 Camper 1.8L Engine Woes

Hi all,
        I recently purchased a '75 Camper with a 1.8L that had 72,000mi on it.
After driving in for about 1,000 mi more it dropped the 3rd cylindar exhaust
valve damaging the head, piston and bending the connecting rod.
        I've got to decide whether to patch this engine, which ran fine before
this happened, buy a parts bus for the engine, or buy a remanufactured
engine(probably upgrading to a 2.0L with hydrolic lifters) from GEX.
        I live in N.Y. state and would appreciate any recommendations as to who
respected VW mechanics are in the Rochester, Binghamton, and Delhi area who
could help me out. Also, if anyone knows where I could locate an engine that's
running great in N.Y. I'd also appreciate it. Any ideas or recommendations
would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

Trevor
