&gt;Background:
&gt;
&gt;1.  I only need one side (4)
&gt;2.  Early 1700 (first six to eight months) had smaller holes in head for
&gt;pushrod tube
&gt;3.  The corresponding o-ring is still available w/23,5mm id (021 109 349 no
&gt;letter)
&gt;4.  The pushrod tubes I need (021 109 335 A ) w/ the 23,5mm od in the outer
&gt;o-ring land have been superseded to the 021 109 335 C w/ a 25mm od in the
&gt;outer o-ring land which will not work with the early 1700 heads

I found a 72 Westy today.
Is there any tell tale marks/differences? Like maybe 2 grooves, one on each 
side, about 2&quot; long, starting about 1/2&quot; from the big end? I pulled a tube 
out of this Westy. Since you mention a 1.5mm difference which is only .060&quot; 
and I was at a self serve yard with no precise measuring equipment.... I 
pulled a 2.0 tube and compared the ends. Visually the 72 'looked' smaller. 
So I used the highly unscientific approach and tried to put the 2.0 big end 
in the 72 head. It was a force and the o-ring half rolled out but it finally 
went in. Couldn't get it back out, had to go all the thru. Took the 72 tube 
to the 2.0. The tube just about fell thru the head hole. Does this sound 
like what you need? I got 4 of them.
