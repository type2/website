Subject: Re: More on my HEATER!

Gee, thanks, Kath!  Advertise to the whole world that California is
not the land of Palm Trees, beaches and bikini-bimbo-babes!  Somebody
might get the notion, listening to you, that the &quot;Sierra Nevada&quot; means 
&quot;snowy mountains&quot; instead of whatever it means...

This whole thread about your heater being warm -- of course it is -- you
live in California -- how ridiculous!  Go surfing and forget it!

I know, its not Friday, and there's no VW content.  I live about 25 miles
west of Kath, but to get to her in my VW now involves something like a 600
mile drive (a local jaunt for you Alaskans, I know) this week as all of the
roads are now blocked by snow until next summer.  For those of you not
familiar with the High Sierra of Sunny California, I have personally seen
snow plows cutting through 40 feet of snow in July on the Tioga Road (the
shortest route between me and Kath, and still about 100 miles!).

ps. &quot;Sierra Nevada&quot; means &quot;snowy saw&quot; in Spanish -- sierras are both saws
and jagged mountains (a joke, I think).
