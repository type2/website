Subject: Popped out gask tank screen??
References: &lt;f9.98a2cc8.281b4ab3_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Forgot to mention this at Everybus (hell, the Westy got me there and
back over a thousand mi!)  - While then engine was out and tank drained,
I changed the fuel filter and decided to check that the line to the tank
was clear, worrying about a clogged strainer, since last year I had a
plugged filter and ran out a lot of rusty silt before the line drained
clear.  I blew compressed air up the tank line and heard the
ujmistakable sound of somthing tumbling along the bottom of the tank-
guess I popped off the strainer?  Anyone experience a problem with it
not being there, other than a plugged line?  I've got my little air
compressor and wire to deal with that if it happens before next engine
pull &lt;-8
