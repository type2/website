You can plug them with long bolts.  I got mine at a local hardware store.
They are metric, but I can't remember the exact numbers... M10, fine thread
maybe?  Take one of the screw-in tubes with you to match thread and length.
Don't go too long or they will extend into the exhaust ports and block the
flow causing a loss of power.  Use washers to space them out if necessary,
or cut the bolt to size.  I loctited mine in there.

&gt;I broke one of the fan blades off trying to get the bolts loose on the fan,
&gt;how much will the missing blade throw off the balance of the fan,  does it
&gt;have to be fixed?

It won't make much difference, but I would keep an eye out for a
replacement in the long term.

&gt;One of the exhaust valves is brown instead of grayish black what does this
&gt;mean?

Not sure... maybe a lean condition?  But replace all four regardless.

&gt;This same valve was sucking in air through a loose EGR connection in the head.

The connections on the head are for air injection, and if there was a leak
there, it would be coming out, not going in.  The EGR goes to the
manifolds, and would therefore not effect just one valve, but at least one
whole side of the engine.

&gt;My brake servo is not connected to any vacuum how much loss of braking does
&gt;this cause?

I'd say it approximately doubles the effort.  Not something I'd want on a
daily driver, although Mike Gensler doesn't seem to mind driving his that
way.  Keeps your leg muscles strong I guess.  :)
