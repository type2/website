Hi again. I am posting again about the bus show in prescott on may 19th &amp; 
20th. I read a message or two about a caravan and I'd love to be a part of 
it. I've got a 71 bus and she yearns to go on her maiden voyage out of town, 
and I think this show would be a blast! So if somebody is still planning a 
caravan let me know please? I'd love to come along! Thanks, bye 4 now
