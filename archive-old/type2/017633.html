With the recent discussion about the Air Flow Control meters, I thought
I might jump in ask a few questions.  I have a '78 2.0 FI engine.
Unfortunately, it's time to replace the Air Flow Meter.  I borrowed one
&gt;from a friend and all of my symptoms disappeared, so I am sure AFC meter
is to blame.  However, instead of purchasing a refurbished unit, what is
keeping me from refurbishing my own.  Has anyone attempted this?  I have
access to PCB design, layout and fabrication tools.  My understanding of
the problems with the units are the resistive traces which the AFC meter
sweeps against usually wear out.  I may be totally off on this one, so
correct me if I'm wrong?  Anybody have any thoughts on the matter?
