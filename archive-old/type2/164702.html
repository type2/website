Subject: Rust protection device - Snake oil or the fountain of youth ?

At Vanfest last weekend, there was a vendor flogging an electronic device 
that is supposed to stop rust forming in vehicles. He had his camper there 
with a couple of bare metal patches which he said had been there since 
February and were still shiney metal. There is a web site at:

http://www.rustguardian.co_dot_uk/

Now I listened to the pitch and my BS dector switched on. The thing is 
though, I remember these being dicsussed before and the science not being 
rubbished completely at the time.

So, if you understand the science, can you explain WHY this doesn't work ?

My instinct is it's too good to be true. I'd love it to work as the cost is 
lower than any reasonable rust repair so I though it's worth asking.

Thanks

Phil
