I found the following statement from Sean Bartnik in the archives:

&gt; If the engine does start, power to the 
&gt; fuel pump is sustained by a set of contacts in the air flow meter that 
&gt; close when the AFM flap deflects due to the incoming air.  But if the 
&gt; engine dies, the flap closes and the contacts are opened, fuel pump 
&gt; shuts off.

I know Sean knows what he's talking about, but mine doesn't work like this. I've got my engine starting only breifly and then dying, but when it dies, the fuel pump continues running. I checked the AFM flap by hand a while back and the spring to make it close is intact. What else should I suspect? Faulty double relay? Incorrect wiring?

This is the same bus I've been working on for months. I had to stop for a few weeks and I'm resuming where I left off, trying to get it running reliably.

Thanks! Joe
