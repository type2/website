That level would not be responsible for the oil light coming on.  The light
comes on when the pressure drops to about 8 psi.  This can happen if the
oil is very hot and the engine is idling slowly.  Tapping the gas to rev
the engine should make the light turn off in this case - if not then you
have a problem.

&gt;I need to drive it tomorrow over
&gt;100 miles. I plan on going out and adding a quart of oil, but even if that
&gt;fixes it, do you think it would be safe to drive tommorrow.

DO NOT add a quart of oil!  That is way too much to add if you're at the
lower mark.  Add 1/2 quart max.
