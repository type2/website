Jim:
Unless your 17 year old son is driving, I'd forgo the $36 rotor and save it
for 911's (different RPM numbers, though) where over reving will actually
cause interference. Floored downhill in 2nd gear, a 2 liter bus would likely
not self destruct, and which of us would try? I think is was a VW CYA
warranty thing, mostly.
