Subject: Aftermarket A/C for Type 2 Camper

Greetings all,

Recent member, first time posting.

A quick intro - My wife has ALWAYS wanted a VW camper, and we have 
looked for the past two years to find &quot;it.&quot; She's been a member of the 
Full Moon Bus Club for quite some time, and that's where she got the 
lead on our newest member of &quot;la famiglia.&quot;

We're down in Charleston, SC, and have recently purchased a 1969 
hard-top camper in NC. We're picking the bus up next week, and since 
we're in the dead of winter, the fact that it doesn't have an A/C unit 
is not yet an issue.

However, come April, A/C will be a must-have item, even for short 
trips. I detest the hot summers down here (I'm more of a West Coast 
guy), and A/C is something we're very serious about acquiring.

Anyone have suggestions about this?

Since I am new to VWs (I did restore a 1957 Nash Metropolitan in high 
school, though) I haven't a clue where to start.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
Anton
