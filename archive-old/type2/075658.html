Subject: Re: [T2] RE: So Cal body/paint shops

I'd check out Cap's Paint &amp; Body.  I've heard really good things about
them from co-workers that have gone to them.  I was gonna have them work
on my bus because it had alot of rust damage, but then I just went and
bought another bus :)

Check 'em out:
Cap's Paint &amp; Body
2121 Orange
Signal Hill, CA

&gt; 
&gt;         Anyone have any comments about either Convertible World in Signal
&gt; Hill,
&gt;         California or ISP West in Carson, California?  I am getting
&gt; estimates from
&gt;         each of them to restore my 72 bus.  Paint, some interior, seals,
&gt; rust etc.
&gt;         They both seem OK, but just wanted to know if anyone has prior
&gt; knowledge or
&gt;         experience with either of them.
&gt; 
&gt; ISP West uses too much Bondo for my tastes.  I've been there a number of
&gt; times with a friend that had his T34 done there so I've seen his and other
&gt; cars in various stages of completion.  Their finished product looks good but
&gt; they cover up their low level metal working and welding skills with bondo
&gt; making them a poor choice, in my book, for long a long lasting job.
&gt; 
&gt; Another friend of mine just got his '68 Type 1 Ghia done at a place called
&gt; The Shop on East Figueroa and we are both very pleased with the work that
&gt; was done and the price.  The car had a left rear quarter completely replaced
&gt; and the graft is invisible even from the inside.  And the rest of the body
&gt; work and paint are flawless.  They were originally recommended to my friend
&gt; by Koch.
