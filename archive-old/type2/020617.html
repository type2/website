1.  There are none on my 71.
2.  Dunno.  Maybe.
3.  Some is the same, but I think the piece in front (FIF) over the 
flywheel is unique to buses. 
4.  I'm on the wrong coast.
5.  Probably alot - $50- $100 if it's real nice.

&gt; Hi Everybody.
&gt; I just signed on to the type2 list, although I've been on vintagebus 
&gt; for half a year (67 deluxe)
&gt; 
&gt; But I just bought a 69 hardtop Westy in white.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a couple of questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Is there supposed to be chrome outside trim strips in any of the 
&gt; window  rubber?
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Will the window from a 67 rear hatch fit the 69? Is there a rear 
&gt; defogger on the 69?
&gt; 
&gt; 3) It's a 1600 SP. Is the engine tin different from bug engine tin 
&gt; fron the same year?
&gt; 
&gt; 4) Does anyone know of a pick-a-part or junkyard in/near Los Angeles 
&gt; with some bay window busses in it? I need the driver's side rear side 
&gt; window (the one with the vent wing, but I have the wing)
&gt; 
&gt; 5) How much should I expect/hope to pay for a clean Westy stool in the 
&gt; yellow/tan color smooth vinyl?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks a lot.
&gt; 
&gt; Glad to be a 2 bus family now
&gt;
