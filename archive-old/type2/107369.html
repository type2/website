Subject: Engine Rebuilders

Hello,
	A friend in Fla. just called me and asked me to find out who I may
recommend to rebuild a 1.9L waterbox for a Westy Camper.  The only person I
could think of is the local VW guru.  The problem is he specializes in 2.0L
and older motors.  Can anyone recommend a good rebuilder?
Many, many thanks in advance,




Yours in air-cooled transport,
