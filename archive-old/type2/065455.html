Subject: Renting VW bus in Queensland, Australia?

Hi, I hope someone on the list from &quot;down under&quot; can help me with
this. Are VW busses or anything similar available for rent in
Brisbane, Australia?

We are going to Australia for three weeks in the end of August,
and were planning to spend a week and a half driving from Brisbane
to Cairns, seeing the sights, hiking in parks, etc. (We fly in
to Brisbane and out of Cairns)

I tried faxing a few Australian auto rental places I found on the
web, but only got one reply, and no mention of camper busses. One
company (Action hire cars, http://whatson_dot_com.au/Guide/Adverts/action.html) 
has a drawing of a pop top buss (probably not vw though) on their web
page, but they did not reply to my fax inquiry. Would be great if
someone with access to local info (newspaper ads, yellow pages etc)
could give me some info.

Ideally I'm looking for:

* One way rental: Pick up in Brisbane, Drop in Cairns.

* About 2 weeks time (Starting Aug 10)

* Prefer VW bus or similar, but a car is ok also. We are only 2
people, and will bring a tent as well.

* Inexpensive (Still on grad student stipend). Drop off charges could
be a big hit, but not all rental companies charges that I've heard.

Any other hints on what to do/not do, where to visit during this
trip would be appreciated. We have the guidebooks, but some personal
recommendations would be nice.

Long shot: Anyone interested in swapping VW busses, 2 weeks in my
bus (82 VW Westfalia camper) in North East US (I'm in Upstate NY) for 2 weeks
in your bus in Queensland? 

Thanks,
Martin
