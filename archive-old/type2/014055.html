Subject: Re: [T2] Neat Finding



&gt; Hi all,
&gt; When I purchased Clementine, in with the owners manual, was an manual
&gt; for a Coleman air compressor, that I guess came with the bus for blowing
&gt; up your tires, inner tubes etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Discovered one at a garage sale yesterday, that matched the description,
&gt; and picture in the manual ( found this out when I got home)
&gt;  
&gt; It works, and even has all the attachment's that are used to blow up
&gt; different item's, and the darn thing is as new----couldn't believe it.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone else out there have one of these?

I have a Coleman Inflatall 150, which may or may not be the same item.  It has a beige plastic case and looks like an electric motor 
mating with a model airplane engine.  It work but inflates anything larger than a bike tire waaaaaaaayyy sloooooowwww.

Mine is not in nearly as nice of shape as yours,  One latch is missing and the case is generally beat up.

I doubt that this particular unit was sold with a VW accessory.  I think that they were sold at sporting good and automotive stores in 
general.
