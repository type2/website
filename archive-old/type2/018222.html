&gt; &gt; Reading clockwise (or left to right) directly from the pulley in the above

&gt;         Don't know how you get this. Any ATDC notches would have to be over to
&gt; the right of the 0 notch ( the furthest right, or #3 as you move clockwise.

we've been over this before... with a scale on the fan housing on a type
4, ATDC marks are to the right, with a pulley mark on a type 1, ATDC is
to the LEFT
