           One trick to help keep the ignition nice and dry is to spray
it with either WD-40 or silicone lubricant. I spray the dizzy, and the
sparkplug wires, and the coil. When I had bajabugs I also used a rubber
surgical glove on the dizzy with the plug wires coming out the
fingertips.
         While the sealed engine compartment on the bus helps a lot to
keep the ignition dry (if, that is, you have a seal in -- which I don't)
in a very heavy rain situation you can take in enough water through the
upside vents to give you problems.
