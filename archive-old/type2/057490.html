Subject: F7 emulsion tubes in dual Webers

I finally got my F7 emulsion tubes last night and installed them minutes
later.  For those that don't remember, this is on a pair of Weber 40
IDF's with 125/190/50/32 on my 1.7 type IV bus.

All I can say is, &quot;WOW!&quot;  There is absolutely NO stumbling during
transition (1500 - 2500 rpm).  And the mid-range power under 3/4 or full
throttle seems to be much better also. I don't know about MPG yet, but
when I have an answer, I'll let all know.

Anyway, I love these new tubes and would highly recommend them if you
experience any stumbling with your current setup.
