Subject: Re: [T2] 009 distributer question

In a message dated 2/24/03 8:04:30 PM, shaggybus72_at_yahoo_dot_com writes:

&lt;&lt; I have a brand new bosch 009 distributor that came with various other 
parts in a box when i bought my bus way back when.  the 009 is in its 
original box and ready to be installed, but I wanted to make sure the 009 can 
go in any air cooled vw motor.  I have a 72 bus with a 1700 type 4 engine.  
Can the 009 go in my bus or are there different 009's for different types of 
motors?  
 &gt;&gt;

Here we go again...The floor is now open...;-)
