Subject: Finally got affordable insurance!  Woo hoo!

--part1_14a.1435436f.2ab95878_boundary

Hey y'all... I *greatly* appreciate all of the suggestions you gave me 
regarding my hunt for reasonably priced insurance for our '76 Westy...

I finally found a sweet deal through AAA Auto Club... I took out a new policy 
with them today that provides the same coverage on both of my vehicles for 
*half* of what I had been paying Allstate *before* their attempt to raise my 
rates 43%... overall I stand to save at least $1,200 - $1,300 over the next 
year compared to what those extortionists wanted to continue my coverage...

What still amazes me from my search was how few other companies wanted to 
even talk to me when I told them about the Westy... including the agency who 
had insured it previously for my friends that sold it to us in April... 
another company that a member of the list had suggested blew me off 
summarily: &quot;we're a *preferred* company... we don't insure anything older 
than 1985...&quot;

Anyway, the hunt is finally over.... Thank you again for all your help!
