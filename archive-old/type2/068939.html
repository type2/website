Subject: '76 Westfalia gone - engine remains

Hi everyone,

Two weeks ago I sold my 1976 Westfalia camper which I had kept on the road the 
last 14 years. I guess that puts me on the outside of this group looking in.
Don't get me wrong it was time for the camper to go a new owner. And I am
happy the way things have worked out. However, it was somewhat like putting a 
family pet down after having shared so much.

On the brighter side... The buyer of my camper did not wish to include the 2.0L
engine in the sale. This was the original engine in the camper. I replaced this
engine at 92,000 miles with one from a 1977 bus. The main reason for this change
was that the '77 had a solid factory exhaust. So if there are any of you looking
for a good '76 2.0l engine we should talk.

I will be taking a close look at the engine over the weekend. I know that the
starter, alt, injectors, intake manifold, and other parts will go with it.

I will post a more formal list of what is there soon. Any thoughts on what an
engine like this will sell for? Junkyards around here are asking $350 if they
have them.

Type2-less

Jim
