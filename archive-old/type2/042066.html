Subject: Alternator wiring??

Howdy,
I have a '77 bus with a &quot;70something&quot; pancake 1700. I bought it for $250.00 and have been (very)slowly getting it back together to see if it will run. The wiring harness in the engine bay has been &quot;modified&quot; by the previous owner and has me confused. I have to put the alternator back in the vehicle and the plug for the alternator is missing. I have schematic drawings that cover all years, so I know that there's a voltage regulator in the circuit somewhere, although I've been told that my alternator has a built in regulator. I can't find anything that resemples a conventional regulator in the engine bay, is there an easy way out here? I know(?) that the heavy gauge wire goes from the alternator to the hot lug of the starter, but do I have to worry about the other connections if this alternator has an internal regulator? Okay, if any one can help I'd really appreciate it. Anyway, my brain hurts from thinking about it.
Thanks in advance,
Jeff
