Subject: Driving 55

Throughout various discussions on this list there have been a few people
championing the idea that our Busses should be driven at 55mph. I have
to admit that I've always kind of scoffed at this in the past but this
morning I calculated my mileage from a trip we took last week and was
amazed to find that for our 1000 mile trip we averaged over 21mpg in my
'71 Adventurewagen (highroof) camper. The trip from San Jose to Las
Vegas through blazing heat required me to drive at 55mph or less for
most of the way. It was a long, slow, boring trip but the Bus handled it
admirably. The engine is a stock 1600 but with a 009, electronic
ignition, and a strange Webber carb that is very similar in size and
characteristics to a 30 PICT Solex. I've never seen a carb like it
before but it sure sips gas at a slow rate. With mileage like that I'll
be tempted to slow down more often.
