Subject: Re: [T2] excessive negative camber, 1 rear wheel

Greg,

Torsion &quot;bar&quot; not &quot;spring&quot;.

probable causes

reference drawing here:  http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/rearaxle6879-2.gif

bent spring plate  &quot;L&quot;
bad torsion bar bushings &quot;M&quot;
bad &quot;a&quot; arm bushing &quot;V&quot;
Bent &quot;a&quot; arm
broken torsion bar &quot;U&quot;

Bent torsion tube housing(or part of it)

Take a good look...and then bite the bullet and start pulling parts off of 
it and checking them

Cheers, dave

&gt; I am experiencing 1 rear wheel with proper camber and
&gt; the other with too much negative camber (or
&gt; &quot;splayed&quot;).  The one that is the problem is on the
&gt; passenger side.  I picked up the bus only a year or so
&gt; ago, and when I did, it looked to me like it could
&gt; have been hit on that side (with the camber off), near
&gt; the wheel (arch looked a little bent inward, etc). 
&gt; Hub, wheel bearing seem good; just replaced the
&gt; shocks.  
he one wheel has the appearance as
 busses/bugs do (and other cars similarly 'suspended')
 when they are carrying a load - but that normally
 involves both wheels &quot;splayed&quot; out - this is just the
 one wheel, with no real load.  Any ideas?  I think the
only thing I'm really faced with safety/structure wise
 is that the tire will likely wear prematurely on one
side - but otherwise it seems solid.  It does look
&gt; goofy though and I would certainly give fixing it a go
&gt; if I had a sense of what the issue might be.  Could it
&gt; be the torsion spring?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Greg ('78 Westy)
