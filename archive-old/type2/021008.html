&gt; So is the CIS an advance over the stock '78 fuel injection? Mtock L-Jet
&gt; system is working well and very reliable but anything that might help power
&gt; would be, in my mind, an advance!!!

&gt; Okay take this one more step forward: which Type IV bus heads flowed the
&gt; best? I think I read that the '73 dual carb heads had the largest valves of
&gt; any of the busses.

Chris:
Actually, 74's had the biggest valves, at 41mm. and 34mm. respectively. the
exhausts were sodium cooled, too, originally. 75's might have had the same
sizes, but not the sodium cooled exhausts. 76 and later went WAY down to
37.5mm. intakes and 33mm. exhausts. The biggest valves on any stock type 4
motors are the 914 2.0 liters and 912E's (stands for Einspritz) Porsches at
42mm. and 36mm. intake and exhaust. The 912E is an interesting motor, being a
76 it has AFC injection and the bigger parts. It has the same bigger stock cam
that came on the 1.7 and 1.8 busses with manual transmissions. I think it had
about 100 hp or so, I guess someone could look it up.
Many years ago, I put together an engine for my late 78 Champagne Edition bus.
I used 74 heads, 96mm. NPR big bores, the bigger solid lifter cam and all stock
fuel injection from the 78. I actually called Bosch in Chicago, talked to a guy
who consulted with another fellow &quot;auf Deutsch&quot; and came back on the line. He
told me: &quot;This has to be OFF-ROAD, you understand? But if you do this, you
should probably add a small resistance like 500-1000 ohms to the head
temperature sensor, to make the ECU think the engine is a little cold.
Experiment with the ohms till it runs right!&quot;
This engine ran pretty nice, had a lot of power, in fact under normal flat
conditions, I could get the speedometer needle almost straight down. It was a
little more peaky than the stock cam, but a LOT more power. (In fact, I still
have the engine, just waiting for the right vehicle.)
