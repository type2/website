Adam,

I suggest, fire it up, let it idle for 10 seconds just to verify clean
start and cold idle function. Drive off but avoid high rpms and load for a
mile or two till the chill is off the oil, then drive normally. Stay within
recommended lube weights for ambient temps, both for engine and transmission. 

This will provide for the fastest reasonable warmup cycle, opening the
choke soonest, using the least fuel. Big time important. The exhaust cross
flow warmup for the manifold will only function properly for fast warmup
and fuel economy if the proper different gaskets are used at the
muffler/manifold flanges. If the gaskets are the same, there is no
crossflow. It makes a 2 or 3 mile per gallon difference. It lowers
significantly contamination of the oil with the cold raw fuel of
excessively cool charge, whether cold or warm. The vast majority of T-I
motors I have seen are out of spec in this regard, 'cause few of the
muffler install hardware kits I have seen include the proper small hole
gasket for one side.
