Subject: Re: high top conversions

Hi,

VW made bay window busses with a factory fitted high-top, BUT they were only
fitted to panel vans. So if your looking for a Combi or Camper this will
have been a conversion! O.T.O.H there were LOADS of after market high-tops
available, but these will have been deleted soon after the bay was replaced
by the Vangoon. If you do find a high-top that fits (or can be adapted - try
mazda &amp; toyota roof lines) it will have to be bonded onto the body to keep
the strength or the van will fold around the first bend you take!!!

Hope this answers some 'Q's
