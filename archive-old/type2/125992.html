Subject: Re: [T2] Check this out...

Michael it's not your wheel cylinders. Back in 1987 I went through this on a Moostang. Rebuilt everything, lost my brakes on the &quot;W&quot; road going off Signal Mountain, TN. ALMOST bit the back of a very expensive import. 

Because the system was a 1966 single circuit (pre-67 government regs) I lost the WHOLE system when 1 wheel cylinder failed. You bus should have had 2 wheels of brakes left - what gives? I think if you lose the left rear, you lose the right front but retain the front left and right rear brakes... Did you pump the pedal? 

Back to the Moostang. REPLACED the wheel cylinders. Lost my brakes AGAIN going down the otherside of the mountain (Signal Mountain Boulevard). Missed the cars, spun out in the grocery parking lot. 

Damn. 

Turns out my drums were so worn out that the shoes could not touch the drums without the wheel cylinder coming apart. Left me with an obsession with seat belts and MONDO braking systems. I like 4 wheel disc brakes! 

SO - measure your drums. Your brake shoe adjustment maybe too loose. Your brake shoe retaining hardware might be shot (mine was) - won't do much for the brake shoes when you are stopping but it might affect adjustments. Check those shoes. Maybe they are arched wrong - bad core. Check that master cylinder b/c you should have had brakes on the other two wheels regardless unless you are driving a splitty - in which case you ought to upgrade the master cylinder! 

Hope this helps.
