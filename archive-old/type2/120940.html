Subject: Re: [T2] Beep Beep!

is your steering wheel bent or is the surface uneven?  that's what 
happens to mine right now every time I turn my wheel (mine's bent).
...  Well, I guess hitting a car and smooshing everything in didn't help 
much either ;)

&gt; That's the sound my horn makes everytime I move the steering wheel!
&gt; It's the spring below the wheel touching the outer column.
&gt; When I remove the spring, all is well.  Can someone tell me what the function of this spring is...and, am I missing something..shouldn't it be OK for it to touch any metal..
&gt; I did just put the column back together and I can't find any extra parts left.  Doesn't make sense.  Any similar experiences or knowledge?
