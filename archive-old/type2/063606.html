So Steve Bradley says:
&gt; &gt; than the bug connectors and he doesn't know of anyone who has them.  RMMW
&gt; &gt; doesn't list them in their catalog, but I haven't called them yet.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Are these really scarce?  Should I expect it to be a dealer only item?
&gt; &gt; Anybody have any other recommended sources?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks,

&gt; I saw some advertised in J.C. Whitney. Don't know how they work though.

J.C.Whitney tends to be generic in their merchandize (See: &quot;One Size Fits All&quot;).
I'd be wary about purchasing something like this from them.  Even after the
technician assures you over the phone that it will fit your model.  BTDT.
