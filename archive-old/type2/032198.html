&gt; The third variant, that the light comes on when the starter is operated,
&gt; is mentioned in my Bentley manual, but I have not seen this variant.

--&gt;  On my 1975 van, the light comes on when the key is turned on but the
engine isn't running, as I recall.  (I can remember it glaring back at me
once when the van stalled at night.)  There is no switch on the parking
brake, that year, which makes it easy to accidentally drive off with it
set if it's out of adjustment and doesn't grip well.  You usually notice
when you go for 3rd gear and your knuckles whack the handle.
