Subject: Compression Test-interesting

No one responded to my query on what to do with a slightly leaking exhaust
manifold (#1 cylinder) if I'm afraid it will break or strip what threads
are left for a nut.  It's been doing this for a year (just slight exhaust
noise).  The current nut is rustwelded into place on one stud (11 mm socket
fits it!); other looks not bad.
     I did a compression test on this never rebuilt 194,000 mi 78 engine,
which I've had since 60K and got:
 3 - 139      1 - 130
 4 - 148      2 - 148

Just for fun, did the oil in the cylinder trick and got
3 - 152       1 - 135
4 - 160       2 - 162

Thus I conclude that even though this is acceptable (great for this milage)
I have worn rings a bit in all cylinders, and  valves are fine, perhaps
running hotting in the front cylinders (get less cooling)-except for #1,
suggesting &quot;some&quot; valve leakage-perhaps overheating from the blowby of hot
gasses from the manifold connection?   How do I deal with the worst case
scenarios (not wanting to pull engine until it gives up) (1) the stud
breaks when I try to loosen the nut (2) I heat the nut (there is room) and
get it off, but stud threads are rusted away!  Help?
