Hi volks,
               This may be of little interest as it's UK (well, Europe) specific information but it seems to me that the natural cap on baywindow camper prices is the cost of a brand new baywindow camper, since even  an undriven early 70's camper won't be worth much more than an undriven '90s one.
 This suggests a ceiling in the UK of about 16,000 pounds, though an undriven RHD Westy might fetch a little more.
 UKL 16000 is about $25,000, but car prices in the UK are ridiculously high (you can import a US car, convert it to RHD+UK spec and still be ahead a few thousand pounds) so it's probably more realistic to convert at parity.
 I'd say an undriven Westy from the mid seventies ought to be worth about $16,000, but you might want to add a premium for rarity since you can't easily get a new one.
 OTOH- if you had such a vehicle you'd need to find a buyer who was prepared to pay that much for it, which might be difficult: I guess you'd auction it, as with other rare vehicles like 911RSRs and hope you got a group of competing bidders.
 At any rate- I'm inclined to agree that while I wouldn't want to spend $10,500 on a Westy,  there are probably quite a few people who would be happy to drop that much cash on the right car.

Cheers,
              W.
