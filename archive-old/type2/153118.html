&gt; The reason I am
&gt; switching is the existing wiring harness is old, brittle and unreliable,
&gt; my ECU is flaky, and I'd like to upgrade to something new, reliable, and
&gt; learn something while I am at it.
&gt; 
&gt; Since this could turn a bit off-topic, consider emailing me off the

play&quot; system for us luddites... ;-)
