Growing RV sales may hurt energy policy, environment

The recreational vehicle industry has reported that sales have jumped more
than 20 percent so far this year compared to last year -- and that the
fastest-growing segment of the RV market is baby boomers. Winnebago
Industries Inc., one of the biggest manufacturers of RVs, plans to expand
its manufacturing capacity by 30 percent this year after ringing up record
sales in the first quarter.

But all of this activity seems to be missing in some showrooms of Houston
RV dealers, who say they're in a slump due to all the bad local economic
and corporate news. One dealer on Interstate 45 North points to the layoffs
at Compaq Computer Corp. in the course of its merger with Hewlett-Packard
Co. as one reason for the downturn in his business.
While low sales are not good news for Houston RV dealers and their
employees, accelerating sales of motorized RVs -- those five-star hotels on
wheels -- is not good news for the country's energy policy or the
environment.

If the public thought there was a problem with the immense popularity of
SUVs -- which don't have to meet the same gas mileage and emissions
standards as passenger automobiles -- a bigger issue might emerge if more
baby boomers begin taking to the highways and byways in motorcoaches. The
median age of RV-owners is now 49 -- down from 60 a decade ago. And one in
12 vehicle-owning households already owns an RV.

The term recreational vehicle covers a wide variety of RVs, from small
pop-up campers hauled behind a car to 30,000-pound, 40-foot-long,
10-foot-high motorcoaches built on the chassis of a 10-ton truck. The
biggest motorcoaches complete with all the appliances and electronic
conveniences of home are, of course, the most popular with affluent
boomers.
For starters, motorized RVs average about 12 miles per gallon of gasoline
-- less for the bigger RVs. When the 1974 oil crisis hit the U.S. and long
lines formed at gas stations for semi-rationed gasoline, the RV industry
virtually went out of business.
A small motorhome is roughly equivalent to a light-duty truck, whose air
emissions are 50 percent higher than a passenger car. The classes of heavy
duty gasoline vehicles range from emitting one-half gram to 5 grams per
mile of nitrogen oxide -- an ozone-forming pollutant which Houston is
currently battling to reduce. Eighteen-wheel trucks -- possibly the
equivalent of the largest motorcoaches -- emit 24 times the pollution of
passenger cars.
Motorized RVs are more popular in the North than in Texas. Nevertheless,
Texans may soon find themselves sharing their roads, gasoline and air with
more and bigger RVs.
