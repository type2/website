Subject: Rear wheel bearings

Gearing up for a rear wheel bearing job.

Why? B/c my driver's side rear stub axle has about 3/16&quot; or a 1/4&quot; of 
in/out play.

The axle nut is tight I THINK.

Anyhow they have never been repacked by me and are of unknown condition at 
190K miles so I'll pack them.

I do remember them making a slight hum 3 years ago when I took it off the 
road (3 years?!?).

Maybe that was the shaft drifting in and out and causing a bit of a hum. I 
have heard plenty of bad bearings and I won't say it sounds bad, just a 
enough noise to say they are making a noise.

Has anyone ever considered putting a grease nipple in the stub axle housing 
to give a pump of grease from time to time?

Would it accomplish anything if it wasn't blowing grease?

I've done this job on a Beetle before and I am not looking forward to it. 
First order of business is to find a 46mm socket. Hope it isn't TOO expensive.
