&gt;Hello all,
&gt;
&gt;I am new to the whole Volkswagen experience, and I just purchased a 1968 Bus
&gt;for $1500.  The engine seemed kind of worn out, and we couldn't't get
&gt;adequate
&gt;power.  Tried to adjust the timing to no avail.  The guy I bought it from is
&gt;really into VWs, and so we switched the engine out for one he knew ran well.
&gt;Now it runs really nicely, but only after warming up quite a bit (20+
&gt;minutes).  If I try to drive it sooner, it will practically stall and it
&gt;goes nowhere fast.  Is this normal?  What can I do to help this warm-up
&gt;process?  Thanks in advance,
&gt;
&gt;Dave
