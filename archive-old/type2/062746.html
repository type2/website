Subject: Where to put radio in '66

I've got a stock (barely functional) radio in the dash of my splittie,
but I want to put a real radio in the bus.  The overhead air vent is already
used for gauges.

The obvious place is under the dash, above the parcel tray, but I'd like to
hear some other, less obvious ideas.  

Thanks,
...Markus
