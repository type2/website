&gt; OK, OK, I've given up on my engine.  I'm a beginner VW backyard mechanic
that has been trying to get my 78 cali. emission bus running.  Yesterday I
gave up, I didn't sell the bus but i swapped engines.  The original engine
was FI with electronic egnition, the engine I just put is a single two stage
carb.
1st problem, how do i by pass the combi relay? If i need to all?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whoa, you cannot run your carb on that FI fuel pump. WAY tooo much pressure.
You need to replace it with one that puts out about 2 1/2 psi.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2, do I need to add a relay into the electrical system before the solenoid.
The reason I ask about the relay is because the bus i removed the engine
from had a relay, of some sort wired in before the solenoid.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Only if you have a hot start problem [no crank when the engine is hot]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

3, which wires go on which terminal of the solenoid?  I have the engine in
and the electrical connected.  I thought it was correct but when i turn the
key the starter spins but will not engage?  the starter worked in the
original bus?  Please help.  Please..
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You need to remove the engine you put in, get the 228mm flywheel and clutch
assembly off your old 78 engine, remove the 210mm or 215mm flywheel + clutch
from your new engine, and put the 228 set-up on it.

What engine did you put in?
