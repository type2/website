&gt;&gt; We're having trouble with temp creep in hot weather in our 62 with the
&gt;&gt; 1776 motor. But from all that's said about speed and temp, maybe we
&gt;&gt; just need to accept driving slower in hot weather. We had to keep
&gt;&gt; around 55 mph to keep temp under 225 last summer.


I have the same problem with my stock 1600dp.  Last weekend I drove &amp; 
the temp stayed around 220-230, but in the summer it goes close to 240. 
    I was going to test the dip stick in boiling water, just to see if 
the gauge is accurate.  I'll have to do that soon...Happy Busing.
