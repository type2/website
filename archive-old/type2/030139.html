&gt; Firstly, most of these are only copper coated, and not real copper.  You
&gt; may need to look harder.
&gt; 
&gt; Second, every single one of these I've gotten (including in the german
&gt; Listritz (sp?) install kits) are OVAL on one side.  Once you get them on
&gt; that stud, they STAY on that stud.  which is good for vibration...bad for
&gt; removal.

They are supposed to be oval (actually, it's usually a tri-oval).  You've
figured out that they are self-locking.

I use liberal anti-sieze on these when I install them and have never had a
problem taking them off.  I hit them with penetrating oil for a couple of
days before I remove them.
