Subject: Re: [T2] Timing questions

Oh yes, I didn't mention the distributer. To be honest
with you, I cannot tell you what kind it is, but the
numbers on it's body are exactly as follows:
JFUR 4

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I have recently purchased a 75 westy - my first
&gt; experience with FI - yikes. I proceded to tune the
&gt; thing up (valve clearence, points etc) and when I
&gt; went
&gt; to set the timing, I ran into trouble. Muir, Bentley
&gt; and the sticker on my engine say to time it to 5
&gt; degrees ATDC, but when I get close to that, it will
&gt; stall before I get there when turning the
&gt; distributer.
&gt; It runs much beter when it is advanced approx. 5
&gt; degrees BTDC. I asked my mechanic about timing this
&gt; vehicle and he said he just sets it so that when
&gt; running and fully advanced (high RPM), the reading
&gt; should be at 38 degrees BTDC....period. Is this
&gt; sound
&gt; practice? It seems to work, but I have never heard
&gt; that before. Also, in adjusting the idle air screw,
&gt; Bentley sais to turn CCW to increase RPM and Muir
&gt; says
&gt; to turn CW. Whatever I do, it doesn't seem to change
&gt; squat and my idle is usually slow and rough, but
&gt; sometimes good. (in other words.. a bit
&gt; inconsistant).
&gt; Other than that, it runs great. Any comments?
