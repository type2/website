Richard:

&gt;It turns over, fires, runs for two seconds
&gt;then dies.  If I give it gas it will idle
&gt;high for ~6 seconds and then will die
&gt;independent of my right foot.  It has gas
&gt;in the tank. I can repeat this indefinitely.

This sounds like an inadequate fuel pressure problem.  Check the fuel
pressure relief valve that returns excess fuel to the tank.

Or, the double relay - the circuitry that activates the electric fuel
pump.

The circuitry design is such that the fuel pump will run under two, and
only two, circumstances - cranking and running.  It may be that your
pump is running during cranking, putting sufficient pressure into the
lines to start and run for a few seconds, but is failing to keep running
once the engine starts and you stop cranking.
