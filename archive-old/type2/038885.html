Subject: Re: Wheels

Pete,
I just finished restoring the wheels from my 71 Westy.  I think you are much 
better off (if your wheels are straight) to have them sandblasted and then 
powder coated.  I had the sandblasting done on 6 of mine for $7.50 each and 
then powder coated them myself.  I believe most powder coating shops will 
sandblast and powder coat a wheel for about $35.00 per wheel.  The benefit of 
powder coating vs painting is that the powder coating will not chip or fade 
or allow rust to come through.  Also any brake dust just rinses of fairly 
easy.  The only down side of powder coating other than cost is the color you 
choose is pretty much permanent but there are thousands of colors to choose 
from.  Don't forget to add into your cost the price of removing your tires 
and remounting and balancing.  

Good luck,
