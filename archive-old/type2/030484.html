&gt; For very-long-term storage, I would also back out the valve adjusting
&gt; screws to relieve the pressure of all valve springs.

actually, it might be better to just undo the nuts that hold the rocker
shafts onto the head.  At least some of the valves will be open no matter
where the engine is in its revolution, and i dont think the adjusting
screws will relieve all pressure... or will they?

plus there will be less adjusting to do with this method once you decide
to put the engine back in service...

this is just a guess, if im wrong let me know...
