Subject: Re: [T2] poptop conversion? 

Hi Chris,

This is a big job. It took me about 100 man/hrs of work to install a 
late-bay (74-79) top onto a 79 transporter body. It could be done by a 
professional welder/bodyshop in about half that time. Have a look at:

www.pottsfamily_dot_ca/westfakia and check out the &quot;Westfakia Creation 
Gallery&quot;.

The main issue is with the double bed, it makes the hole in the roof a 
LOT larger. And the roof gets heavier in the process as well.

But since my bus now sleeps 5, I'm certainly not going to talk you out 
of it.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
Toronto, Ontario, Canada

&gt; hi there list,
&gt; i'm in need of some advice on replacing the
&gt; poptop on my 70'Westie. i've located a lid
&gt; that's in decent condition, but it's from a
&gt; 73camper?.?. it has the front luggage rack where
&gt; my 70'has a rear luggage.
&gt; i prefer the newer set-up. with the ability of
&gt; adding weight to the front of the bus instead of
&gt; the rear.
&gt; and after takin some quick measurements at the
&gt; junkyard, it looks like it'll work. but i was
&gt; wanting to double check with u all, and get your
&gt; opinions on the idea.
