John--

I forgot to mention, install the panels with stainless steel sheet metal screws and finishing washers. This gives a very clean look and they'll last forever.  I use stainless steel for everything on my bus...it costs a bit more, but it's doesn't strip out as easilly, looks much better than zinc, and lasts many times as long.  Make sure you always buy cobalt drill bits also, as this will save many headaches drilling into metal.
