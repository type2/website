Ron, Pat,

Neither do I believe there is *any* way to convert the DC Westy fridge to
3-way operation (12V/110V/LP).  What I was contemplating was gutting the
icebox cabinet on my '73, or removing that cabinet entirely and installing
a 3-way replacement.  Silly as it sounds, I would rather have a fridge
than a sink.  Water is far easier to find than cold most places. 

Norcold makes a couple of units that might fit.  The models I considered
are:

Model   Height      Width      Depth    Comment
323     20 1/4&quot;     17 1/2&quot;    20 3/8&quot;  I think this would fit in
                                        the present cabinet.
443     30 7/8&quot;     23 1/2&quot;    24&quot;

653     43 1/4&quot;     23 1/2&quot;    24&quot;      With freezer!

So why ain't I got one?  Price!  Model 323 costs a miniscule $540.00!
Model 443 costs $892.00 and model 653 costs $989.00.  Ouch!  Maybe when my
hitherto undiscovered rich and childless uncle dies.
