Subject: Re: [T2] replacing windsheld and rubber together?

&gt; I think the police would have something to say about you driving a vehicle
with no windshield. Yes, remove the old one yourself, but have the Bus towed
or rollbacked to the repair shop.

I just drove mine about four miles to the glass shop.  Figured I could talk
my way out of it if I had to.  Took small streets.

My buddy drove his from my house in LA back home to Santa Barbara, about 90
miles, mostly on the freeway, sans glass.  Said it wasn't too bad if he kept
the other windows closed.

This was probably nuts.

Regards,

Grant
