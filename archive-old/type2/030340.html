Volks,

Just so everyone knows (except the people who will confirm their
subscriptions 5 minutes after this post :-)  If you ever have a question
about anything related to the list that you think might not be appropriate
to the entire list, write to me.

For reference, valid e-mail addresses for me are:
dworkin_at_ari_dot_net          (my personal address)
dworkin_at_type2_dot_com        (my address at the list server)
type2-admin_at_type2_dot_com    (the &quot;official&quot; administrators address... where
                          to write when you are really upset :)
                          Note that this may be the best one to save.  I
                          won't be administrator forever, but someone will
                          always be administrator, as long as the list
                          exists!

                          advice :)

If you are really, really, really upset, call me at (703) 694-7689. BTW,
if you are that upset, be warned that I'll probably just hang up on you
:-)  OTOH, I usually have a beer in the fridge and a parking spot out back
with an extension cord that will reach to the plug on a Westy :-)

P.S. It's 0005 EST, 0505 GMT and Friday's over :-)
