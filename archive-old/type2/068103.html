Subject: Someone REARENDED me!!!!

OHHHHHH NOOOOOOOO!

Well, coming home from work on Friday, it happened.  Some guy slammed
into the back of the bus at a pretty good speed:(  He was reading a
map on his way to the airport and didn't realize traffic had come to a
standstill.  I was wearing my seat belt, and everything ended up in the
front seat with me.  No one was hurt, thankfully, and that is all that
really matters.  His rent-a-car's air bag did stain/burn his shirt
though, and his rental Ford became a whole lot shorter.   

As for the bus, the engine is fine and driveability seems ok, although
it seems to be pulling even more to the right.  The rear bumper and
rear apron are now concave at the middle, with the bumper only
attached on the left and the engine hatch of course not catching.
The bumper's right side bolts were ripped out of the apron, tearing
the metal.  In the engine compartment, the right side metal, the lip
just next to the battery, is folded/buckled.

The muffler has been flattened (that spells LOUD) and the right heat
exchanger is bent, and the tin at the right heat exchanger was popped
off.  Tail lights and brake lights no longer work.

Went to get an estimate, and both places shook there heads and said,
TOTALED.  At least as far as insurance companies are concerned.  They
said the cost to fix is way beyond the blue/gold book value, which fair
(lowest rating) for a 1973 campmobile is $1000.00 (good is $1600, and
excellent is $2500), and said that the insurance company will just cut
me a check for that amount and say bye-bye:(

The interesting thing is, just days before the accident, someone saw
me insulating the doors of the bus, we got talking and he told me of
his friend who has a RUST-FREE (we'll see, I am going to look at it
tonight) 1973 campmobile without an engine.  He says the poptop,
canvas, and tranny are all in great shape.  Maybe it was meant to be, 
we've been talking about looking for a rust free bus to put the engine
in.  (other funny thing is the person who pulls over in rush hour
traffic to let us use his phone turns out to be a friend of mine who
lives in another state, who just happened to be driving by.  karma?) 

Anyway, the plan now is to buy that bus, pull my engine and replace
all the seals and install the heads I am just beginning to rebuild
(possibly new pistons and cylinders).  Place the &quot;overhauled&quot; engine
(and my tranny if need be) in the rust free bus.  Throw together the
spare engine (that I bought in pieces) and make something that runs,
even if it is badly.  Install it in the now damaged bus and sell it for
a couple hundred with the intent of being totally clear with the buyer
that this is an as-is bus.  If it works out to plan, Amelia and I will
have a rust free camper with decent engine, and there will not be one
less bus on the road.

My dilemma is, should I take the time to make the smushed bus runnable,
or should I strip it and crush it.  Rust has got a pretty good hold on
the 'ole girl.  Front floor is on its way out, another year and it'll
be a flinstones car.  Lots of memories in that old bus, it'd be sad to
send it away like a useless scrap of metal, but on the other hand, with
rust really taking hold, how much of a useful life is left in her?
Ahhh, maybe I'll find someone who just wants a well loved bus, and
doesn't mind the rust.  

Thanks for listening all, it was a sad evening last Friday, Amelia and
I saying, &quot;but its OUR bus&quot;.  I know not all of you are so sentimental
about your rigs, but then again, I know some of you are.  The
memories... 

take care,
        brandy
