Subject: Re: [T2] The first dropped valve seat

In a message dated 12/8/04 7:33:41 PM, ratwell_at_mac_dot_com writes:

&lt;&lt; I was reading a Porsche biography last night and Ferry recounted the time 
when they were testing the first 3 VW prototypes and coming down the mountain, 
the head overcooled and the valve seat fell out. This was in 1938!

 &gt;&gt;

No problem...They were still under warranty at Tatra... ;-(
