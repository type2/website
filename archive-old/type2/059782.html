         Reply to:   re: FI has me stumped me
I'm having similar problems with my FI Automatic '79 Westy engine. Maybe these problems are related.

On cold starts, it turns right over and runs, provided I give it a healthy and steady supply of fuel. I usually keep it like that for a few minutes, until I think it's warm enough to put into gear. If I let off the gas it sputters and sounds like it's not hitting on all cylinders (2?!) It instantly goes to a very low idle when in gear. Now if I keep enough gas on it, it will all of a sudden hit all the cylinders and we're off and running, smooth as can be. However, until the engine warms up completely (like after 1/2 hour on the highway), any time I stop, it will sputter and miss cylinders and lurch in gear, etc. After a full warm up those symptoms are a little better, but not much.

Could this be a cold-start valve issue? Is it possible that this thing is on all the time when the ignition is on? Maybe it's just running VERY rich, and at highway revs it doesn't matter, but at idle it really does. 
The ignition system seems to be in good order following new points, condensor, plugs, timing, etc. Thanks to all the listees for the help in doing that stuff!

Also, I've read about these cold-start things, but I have no idea where it is or what it looks like on my engine. Can someone give me a clue?

Thanks Volks,
