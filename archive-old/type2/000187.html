Nancy,
 Sounds like the cable. I had the same thing happen to me, but it didnt 
actually break. it streatched so much (kinda half broke and expanded its 
self) that it was too long to use. i used a lug nut to put in the space where 
the adjustment is, and drove home on it. If you have Muir, and dont mind 
getting your hands dirty, it'll save you a bit of money. It only took me a 
half hour or so to do my first time. Not hard.
