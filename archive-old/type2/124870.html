Subject: Am I looking at the correct hose in ETKA

Hi all:

I always have a difficult time figuring out what ETKA is telling me when it
comes to hoses.  The fabric-covered rubber hose that comes off the Decel
Valve and then connects to the clear plastic hose that then connects to the
&quot;T&quot; elbow on the left rear of the air distribution box is shot on my '82.
(Manual trans vehicle.)

In looking at ETKA (Model: VA, Year: 82, MG: 1, SG: 33, Illustration: 27-00)
it seems like the hose I'm seeking is Item 3 in the illustration which is
identified as Part N 904 023 01.  This part further carries the designation
&quot;14x4&quot;.

Do you agree that this is the correct part?  I ask because the orientation
of the various bits in Illustration 27-00 doesn't seem to be correct (e.g.,
the Decel Valve is pointing the wrong way).

And, just to refresh my memory, is the designation &quot;14x4&quot; indicating that
the I.D. is 14mm, with the wall thickness being 4mm, such that the O.D. is
22mm?

Thanks!
