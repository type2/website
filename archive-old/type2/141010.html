Subject: heater &quot;systems&quot;

Gonna throw myself on the discussion &quot;BBQ&quot; on this subject, and ask how 
difficult it would be to make an adaptation to the current design of 
&quot;danske&quot; stuff, and ( hush my mouth), make it simpler, out of current levels 
of technology, for the same purpose?  It is a cable controlled device that 
has heat and flow, but maybe there is a &quot;better&quot; way to do it, with &quot;good&quot; 
parts rapidly dissappearing, it would do well to look at making a simpler 
device, on the same &quot;theme&quot;, as the original, somewhat like the Automatic 
transmission from inception to now.  I admit, &quot;we&quot; are few, and like the 
Bison, dissappearing more each year, but with all of what we have at our 
beconing, ....it has to be possible, not for profit, but just to be had. 
Just musings of a vvvveeeery long day.
