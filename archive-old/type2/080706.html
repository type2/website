To anyone that can help,
 
Well, I talked to Mike Dearing at Salem Imports and he said that he will
not be able to help me out this weekend.  (Thanks anyhow Mike :-)  )
So, It looks like I will need to try and gather a small group of people
to help me drop the engine.  I tried to email Mad Uncle Dave but had no
luck.  I am in Marion, NC 28761.  I can get the bus anywhere within
about 250-300 miles of where I am at.  Road trips on freeway longer than
50 miles will allow the oil to begin leaking via a steady stream from
the rear main.  As stated before, I have one set of all the seals that I
need to replace.   I also have a clutch disk and a washer for it.  I
have 1 floor jack, 2 jack stands, and some common tools.  I was not able
to get a hold of a seal remover though.  Is there anyone in the TN/NC
area (Or Anywhere) that would volunteer to help me out.  Doc Ric offered
his assistance but type IV's are not his specialty (Although I am sure
that we can probably get through it just the two of us). Steve Dolan is
booked through the end of this month and can't make any more resue trips
And it would take me the weekend just traveling to try and get to Jason
Laster's place.  Like I said, I can either try and do this at my place,
or at someone elses.  The situation that I am in leaves me to try and do
this on a weekend because it is my only mode of transportation.
However, the bus will not make it much longer the way that it is and
this needs to be done soon.  I am determined to get this done and if
worse comes to worse, I will drop it at my house by myself.  (Knowing
that I will get myself into trouble though due to lack of knowledge.)
All I have to offer at this point is a couple hundered dollars and my
two hands.  If this happens at my place I can offer food, shelter,
internet, beer, whatever.  Anyone willing to help a bus owner in
dispare?  Would like to try and do it this weekend if possible.   I must
thank the list again for all the help that has been provided.  I hope
that one day I will have the knowledge to be able to return the favor
back.  
 
Thank You
 
 
In Dispare,
