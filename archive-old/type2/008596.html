Subject: tip for changing plugs in 72,T4's
Mime-Version: 1.0

A comment on what I read about the 72 being a bear to change the plugs
in....try this- put a very long rachet extension on your plug socket  so
that it almost touches the engine deck ceiling when socket is on the plug.
NOTE where the end is and mark it with tape or smily sticker or
whatever....now you have an ANGLE guide for getting the plug later, putting
it back, or sticking in a compression tester.  USE SOCKET LOCKING
extensions---a boon when pulling the plugs and screwing them by hand!   I
attach the rachet end after getting the socket on (removal), or after hand
screwing them in.
