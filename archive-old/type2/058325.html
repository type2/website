Brian and the List,

It is not a good idea to just cut off the ends of the cables and replace them.
The original cables have the ends molded to the wires and are sealed against
corrosion pretty well.  The replacement ends that you can buy clamp the wires
on.  This does not make a very good connection and an even worse seal.

Replacing the cables is very easy.  The ground (negative) cable is short and
goes from the battery to a bolt on the chassis nearby.  The positive cable
takes a bit more work, but should be easily accomplished.  Just trace it out
and make notes if needed.  You can get the ground cable just about anywhere,
but you might need the specific cable for the positive side as it has a
smaller wire attached to it as well.

Good luck, you CAN do it!
