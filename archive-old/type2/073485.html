&gt;No one is really slagging the Bus Depot.

They were, but that's irrelevent.

&gt;It is important that we discuss our supplier experiences.

Fine, but the Bus Depot thread has been killed.  Go back and read the
charter, and if you disagree with it, unsubscribe.

&gt;I, for one, would
&gt;never have thought of going to either brokenbus_dot_com, or JB Heater Source if it
&gt;wasn't for these conversations.

You are missing the point.  Bus Depot experiences have already been
discussed recently and repeatedly.  They are in the archives.

What do we have to say to get this thread to die?
