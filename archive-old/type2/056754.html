Hello everyone my name is Chris Poage and I just got my firts volkswagen today and befor I start driving it around I wanted to make sure that Everything was in good working order. So heres the only major issue so far: When you push the breaks they tend to go right down to the floor, unless you pump them then they will build up more pressure and not go down so far. My dad says tbat means the master cylenders shot. So I guess my question is just Is my dad correct? and if so, I can easily get parts to do it myselfe but do you think that a novice like myselfe could replace the master cylender and what are the steps you have to go through? Im just excited to get this thing on the road as soon as possible but I thought being able to stop was important too ... Well thanks for taking your time to help a new guy out

btw: its a 1964 standard white/blue paint real clean looking no rust except where someone shot bullet holes through the floor in the back(there starting to rust a little) and theres just a tiny bit of rust in the front to the left of my left foot. its also got a 1.6l in it as upposed to the stock whatever it was. its real clean and Im real excited!
