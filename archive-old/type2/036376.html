Subject: Re: **towing hitch wanted**

A '71 should have a 1600 engine.  At least mine does.

Essentially, the towing limit is either the limit of the hitch or the
cargo capacity of the bus.  This is about 1500 pounds for a camper or 2000
for a panel or station wagon.

Note that this tow weight must be subtracted from the load you are
carrying inside the bus.  If you put four 250 pounders in the bus then you
can only tow a 500 pound load (including the trailer weight)

Practically, 1000 pounds is the limit, since steering and braking suffer
above this value.  You don't want the tail wagging the dog!
