Subject: Stike vwoa

Hello all,
The recent notice to local vw guy Metwizard by VWOA got me thinking. I know
that it is within VWs legal right to protect their trademarks so this is not
another gripe. What i suggest is a constant 'counter attack' on our part.
This is something that I already do myself, just for fun. Does anyone
remember the ads that VW put in VW Trends and Hot VW showing a bug next to a
jetta? It says to keep it real , buy genuine VW parts.  I started  going
into the dealerships around here asking for the front apron for my 71
squareback , or the treasure chest doors for my 68 single cab , the front
turn signal lights on my 62 single cab as well as other things, Of course
the answer was that it was no longer available.  My point was that i was
responding to VW ads and to just pester them.
If we all ,the internet vdubers as well as the rest of the community , call
or go in person to ask about air cooled parts perhaps vwoa or at least local
dealerships and their staff would be more inclined to &quot;look the other way&quot;
or maybe even start selling some of the stuff that is made south of the
border or in dusty dealer storage rooms.

just a thought
