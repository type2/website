What do you mean by &quot;Engine temp&quot;?
What are the temperature readings before scoops and after?
What kind of gauges are you using?
What kind of transducers are you using with those gauges?
What is the location of the transducers?
Are your gauges calibrated?  And if they are how did you calibrate them?
What were the conditions of your test ie: air temperature, head wind, tail 
wind, vehicle speed, duration of test, type of body style, type of engine, 
any modifications to the engine?
I mean no disrespect but without defining variables the information is 
worthless.  And with defining the variables the information is really 
valuable to all us eager &quot;listees&quot;.
