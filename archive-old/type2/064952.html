Subject: Horn Wiring - How many ways? (long)

I've been impressed by the thread on spurious hooting 
horns.  After reading the many explanations and 
work-around solutions, I wonder how many different 
horn circuits are extant on type 2's.
 
FWIW, the simple system and the one I've seen over the 
years (Lucas excepted) is the hooter itself has a 
permanently connected &quot;hot wire&quot; and the other half of 
the circuit is a wire looking for &quot;ground&quot; via the 
steering box and up the hollow worm shaft to via 
insulated wire to an insulated disc in the center of 
the steering wheel.  A grounded spring makes contact 
with the center of the insulated disc by depressing 
the button in the center of the wheel.

The common cause of spurious toots was always 
deteriorated insulation on the &quot;bullet wire&quot; (so 
called because it passes through the rifle drilled 
worm shaft). Replacing the bullet wire was/is simple; 
much simpler than adding a button on the dashboard.

Later vehicles with crushable indirect steering 
columns can't use the &quot;bullet wire&quot; concept.
