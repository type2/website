	Scott,
	WHOOPS! You're right! I saw 'on' and read 'off'!
	
	I think what Shawn is trying to do is get agreement that he has
a problem. He DOES! If he doesn't get the alternator and oil pressure lights
on when he turns on (but does not crank) the engine then something
IS wrong and as you say, he should fix that first. I'd start with
the instrument cluster ground wire.

	Shawn,
	If you don't have one, this might be a good time to borrow
or buy a volt meter. A spare tail or side-marker lamp with a couple
insulated wires soldered to it makes a sorta substitute- (18 to 24 inches
for each wire,  with aligator clips is nicer, wrap the metal part of the 
bulb in electrical tape so it doesn't short-out when you lay it on things)
You can tell '12V' from ground at least. (and hook it across the sender
back at the engine and regulator for starters.)

	Bill
