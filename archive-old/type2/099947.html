Subject: Re: [T2] Removing carpet glue ??

&lt;&lt; Owner before last of my 71 had glued shag carpet over
the entire interior of by bus encluding engine
compartment. The guy I bought it from had pulled out
all the carpet leaving quite a ugly sight of carpet
glue with shreds of carpet. 

Does anyone know the best way to get rid of this mess?

3 M (among others) makes an adhesive remover...A de-
cent hardware store should carry it...Open all the doors
and windows and pick a windy day. It's not at all fun to
inhale ;-( This presupposes that the installer used car-
pet adhesive...
