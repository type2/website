+AD4-yo,
+AD4-         as we speak,  my engine is waiting to be installed back from
whence
+AD4-it came.  here's the problem. while the engine was out i gapped my valves,
+AD4-thus turning the flywheel. now my engine doesn't want to go home.  is this
+AD4-because i turned the flywheel? everything on the outside seems to be lined
up
+AD4-correctly. it's a 1700 on a 72'. please advise.


I'd have thought your problem was the clutch. Is it likely that the clutch
plate has moved? Even if you didn't take it off, that last twist when you
pull the engine out can be enough  to move the plate slightly out of line. A
clutch alignment tool is the proper way to go, but you can sometimes line it
up with a socket or tube wrench of about the right size. Even a wooden dowel
might work.

Good luck.
