Yuck.  I had this leak before on 2 liter from a '78.  It stems from over
tightening the oil strainer.  The bolt/plug that is leaking holds the
strainer in place from the side.  This is not fun to replace -- I've heard
several techniques -- Here is what I did.

To get the bolt out you need to remove the strainer, then the bolt will come
out.  Clean out bolt hole real,real good.  Let the oil continue to drain
over night. clean off the bolt put locktight on the end of the treads,
insert it and begin to tighten.  Slather the bolt head with and and stem
with JB weld - tighten it the rest of the way (this is after the stainer is
back on).Put more JB weld on it.   Cross your fingers and wait a day.

Another technique is to cut the bolt off about 3/4 inch from the head.  Cut
a notch in on the top of the treaded potion of the bolt, so now it is like a
screw.  With a screwdriver tighten the  treads into the engine.
Tap in to the case (where the bolt goes through) and get a plug that fits
newly tapped hole.

If you have any questions or this is not clear please contact me

&gt; developed and oil leak from the left side of the engine, it drips down of
&gt; the low part of the case on the left side.  I thought this was probalby
&gt; due to a leaking oil cooler but after removing the left side cooling tin
&gt; under the bus I discovered that it was leaking from a bolt in the case.
&gt; It's located in a recess right between and a little below the 4 valve stem
&gt; tubes.  So I figured the bolt was a little loose and I could just tighten
&gt; it a tad and that would be it.  Well I tried to tighten it but the thing
&gt; just turns without going in or coming out.  I thought maybe there was a
&gt; nut on the other side of the engine that I had to hold but I can't find
&gt; one anywhere.  After searching the archives I found several mentions of
&gt; oil gallery plugs that are just pressed in.  Is this one of those?  Did my
&gt; trying to tighten it just make it more loose?  Any thoughts or advice
&gt; would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance
