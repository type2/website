getting the power is the easy part. The problem is that the engine is only
designed to get rid of 90hp worth of heat, and there are definately times
that even the stock design fails to do even that!

I had a friend that had a 78' bus that ran high 11s in the quarter mile (not
a misprint), but it was far from reliable. If you do go this route, plan on
$3000 for the turbo and plumbing, and don't expect that level of power for
more than 30 seconds at a time, or you will be buying engine parts real
soon.

(I run one on my race car, BTW).

&gt; A Porsche style cooling setup might reduce the effects of this but they
are very
&gt; expensive!

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, VW aircooled
&gt; &gt; cooling systems are not easily improved, since the depend upon the
finning
&gt; &gt; to move the heat out.
