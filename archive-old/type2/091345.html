Subject: '78 westy timing

 I recently joined the list and everyone's advice is very helpful and I
need advice. The '78 is a 2.0L FI and I can not find any timing numbers
on the fan pulley. Are these numbers on an adhesive strip and missing or
am I looking in the wrong location. Also I am geeting gas in the oil. I
checked the cold start valve, injectors and have replaced the points and
spark plugs. Everything checks ok except the points was pitted. Thanks in
advance for your help.
