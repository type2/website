Subject: Re: [T2] the craziest off-road trip you've taken in your bus

We went on quite a few 4WD type roads in Baja in a stock '72 westy. 
No need for a &quot;baja bug&quot; when you got a bus!

Shook the hell out of our bus down there, but got there and back with 
no problems (albeit taking it slow and easy).

One of our favorite places was Guadalupe Canyon hot springs.  When we 
got to the top we were the only 2WD vehicle there!  People couldn't 
believe that a '72 bus made it up the mountain.

Another wicked ride in Baja was from San Felipe down the east coast 
through &quot;CoCo's corner&quot; then connecting to the main highway north of 
Bahia de Los Angeles.  We actually went off the main dirt road at 
times and drove the dune buggy trails...roller coaster fun!  (but 
stupid out in the middle of nowhere)

And finally, at the tip of Baja from San Jose del Cabo up the east 
coast dirt road.  50 miles took over 4 hours..


&gt;So, I was curious what the craziest offroad trail is that people 
&gt;have taken their bus on.  We're talking the standard loaf, 79 and 
&gt;down, 2wd, no syncros ;)
