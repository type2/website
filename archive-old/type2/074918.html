Subject: Re: [T2] Tricks - emmissions

These are things I learned from a person who makes cars pass emmissions for
a living. His shop was two blocks from a emmisiions test station.

* Go to your local parts store or whatever and purchase two cans that
proclaims the contents will make you pass the emmissions test.
* Pour one into a full tank of gas and use as much as you safely can.
* Pour the other into another full tank of gas.
* Since most of the hydro carbons are in the oil you wnat to change the oil
JUST PRIOR TO driving to have your vehicle emmissions tested. Make an
appointment for the emmissions test. Change the oil / filter and air
cleaner; start the vehicle up and drive where you can maintain a constant
speed (50-60 as previously suggested) until it is warmed up to the proper
operating temperature; pull into the emmissions test station and have them
test it IMMEDIATELY, do not let it idle for any prolonged period. This
process will give you the best advantage.
There are other items of preparation that can only help and they are just
the standard things you would normally do anyway.
* Change your spark plugs. And check the sparks plug wires. Use the best you
can afford.
* Inspect the distributor cap and rotor.
* Make sure your timing is correct. California does not give you a very wide
range on timing. This comes from experience.
* Check for any vacuum leaks.
* Check all of the emmissions related electrical connections.
* Change and use the best air cleaner you can afford.
* Make sure you use a high quality gasoline.
* This is a good time to change all your fuel filters.
* Make sure your thermostat is functiong correctly.
* Don't show up at the inspection station with obvious oil and water leaks.
That is like showing up at work in a bad suit or Levi's.
* If your vehicle is questionable to passing an emmissions test take the
time and expense of having a pre-test. Better than being a Gross Poluter.
* Take it to a place that excepts bribes. Leave a case of beer and $50 bucks
in the front seat. Ah yes, my '92 Camaro ;^)

Surely I left some items off this list, just use common sense and spend a
little time and effort and you should be ok.

&gt; &gt; #1. Go for inspection with a new oil change.
&gt; &gt; #2. Get fresh fuel if the van has been sitting or has any additives in
the
&gt; tank.
&gt; &gt; #3. Run it hard at 50-60 MPH for fifteen or twenty minutes and get it
good
&gt; and hot.
&gt; &gt; Those are the tricks I know.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I once gave a used car dealer some free advice, and by way of
reciprocation,
&gt; he told me that when they were trying to unload a car with a smoky engine,
&gt; they put high temp cooking oil in it, usually Crisco.  Had a chuckle over
&gt; that, but did not go to him for my next car.
&gt;
