Subject: Another jetting question

I know the jetting question has circulated already but I am still a bit
confused.  I have a '73 bus with dual carbs 34-PDSIT-2/3's.  The engine
fan says its a AW, but the engine is a new 2000cc with 1800 heads.  The
manual say this about the dual carb series of busses

year	disp	main jet	air correc	pilot
1972	1700	137.5		155		55
1973CB	1700	137.5		140		55
1973CD	1700	132.5		155		50
1974	1800	130		175		52.5

I think mine is
1973	2000	XXX		XXX		XX

can someone help me get an idea of jet sizes for the 2 liter?
thanks.
