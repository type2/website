Subject: '76 brochure picture

The engine in the picture from the 1976 brochure must have been made up 
especially for the picture. The exhaust isn't right for a '76, and I 
cannot figure out what the red hoses are supposed to be. Certainly if 
the color of the fan shroud in this picture made it into production 
engines, there would be more evidence of it than this picture.

On the other hand, there aren't many pictures of original 2000 cc 
engines out of the vehicle when new, so this is as good as anything, 
and I think it looks wicked good.

Mark
