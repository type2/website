Subject: Re: [T2] Re; Parcel Trays

&lt;&lt;So, to bring this argument to it's full, small circle, what do you do
if you don't have money and you want some parcel trays, and you enjoy
being creative?&gt;&gt;
 
Then ya build it.
No choice.

Now to really bring this discussion to another full circle----

Why does it seem ( not only with the Type 2's as well as in Vanagonland
) that possibly the most money sucking vehicles are owned and operated
by the least monetary affluent?

I don't mean this to be a negative jab, but it sure seams to be a fact
of life on the VW planet.

I can't figure this one out for the life of me.


Now on to the tray discussion---
 
it's OK to be creative.

I'm always doing this kinda stuff at work, fabricating something that by
time I'm all done I could have gone to the store, or parts house and
bought one at 1/4 of the price.

 
I'm talking about rebuilding Cat bucket teeth, shank's, locking pins,
cutting edge's, clevis pins, battery boxes, control lever's, rebuilding
Mack fiberglass hoods, etc.

It's an old world depression state of mind---make do with what you have.

But sometimes ( most ) of the time I have more into the job, plus the
materials and is not the better choice.
 
If ya enjoy doodling around and making stuff , and have all the time in
the world--more power to ya.

What I was saying is that by the time I got done with the project, I
could have had one that looked as should have when the Bus was new, put
it in, and at a quarter of the price.

If the parcel tray was a unique item that was available no where else on
the planet then, yes, I would have built mine too. 

But time is money.

I just don't have that much time.


Hasta,
