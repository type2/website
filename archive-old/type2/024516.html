&gt;Here's the situation on which I'd like your opinion On the way back from Nevada
&gt;to where he lives in California he &quot;noticed it had low compression.&quot;
&gt;(This guy admits he is not very mechanical at all.)  He took it into a shop where
&gt;the mechanic did a compression test &amp; said it needs &quot;a head to get by, and
&gt;while it's down you might as well replace the other one as well.&quot;

I think the current owner noticed something was wrong with the bus, (low power, problems on hills, or overheating)
he took it in, the mechanic did a compression test then told your friend the engine had low compression, and it
'needed a head to get by'

I would take this to mean one cylinder, probably #3, has a compression reading under 100 foot pounds. Telling him
he should do the other head at the same time is a matter of opinion on the part of the mechanic. You seem to be
looking to do a Muldoon job that will get you back to the midwest, where you can then worry about the other head,
pistons, cylinders etc. The main thing is getting from CA to IND and in that case, I'd fly out there with one head &amp; a
compression tester. first thing you do is get the bus warmed up, then run a compression test, you have to find out
which cylinder is too low so you can replace the appropriate head. If you want to find out about the rings, test the
compression
once, then squirt a few drops of oil in each spark plug hole and test the compression again - a significant jump in
compression
after the introduction of the
oil - not 10 pounds, but like 30 pounds - would confirm the need for new piston rings.

Otherwise find the low cylinder, drop the motor, and Remove and replace just the one head. You can do that job in about
6 hours if you hump it hard, then you're on the road.

 &gt; He said the reason these motors usually have low compression is because the rings aren't seating well on the cylinder
 walls
&gt;because of overheating.

Which came first? Overheating motors or worn rings?  Say one of those hydralic lifters failed, and caused an exhaust
valve to
remain open too long, so it began to burn up and when the valves were finally reset the valve already was too far gone,
so it
leaked compression from then on, so the compression in that cylinder dropped, the van worked extra hard on the remaining

3 cylinders which quickly caused the motor to get real hot, which thinned the oil significantly so that parts were no
longer getting
sufficient lubrication and then maybe a ring land shattered but remained floating between two compression rings, in a
limbo, not
yet able to go flying around in the crankcase, but not really holding the rings properly against the cylinder walls and
that would
probably cause ring wear. So, in answer to your question, 'it's hard to know'  bring a copy of the idiot book, make sure
 your idiot
lights both work when you turn the key, but my guess is you can nurse it back with just the head replacement.
