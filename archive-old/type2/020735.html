Subject: Clutch noise-how long does a disk last?

I replaced my clutch disk (German, not a cheapie) at 150,000 mi and it
still had usable lining.
Now, 70,000 mi later, when I let the clutch pedal out (in gear), there
is a loud grating, grinding &quot;shr-r-r&quot; noise (worse if you rev it up
before letting out the clutch) just as it grabs, and it runs fine when
fully grabbed.   If you set the parking brake, you can push the clutch
in and out and get the sound every time it begins to grab the disk.  No
it can't be the throwout bearing, for it makes no sound when you push
the clutch in.  Yes the flywheel needlebearing (centers the disk) is
suspect from past events (had some possible sticking after wet weather),
but then you'd expect chattering or intermittant grabbing when fully
clutched (pedal in) in gear- I know that feeling and this is not it- no
chattering.   A loose pressure plate would give similar chattering.  So
I must ask- given proper driving (I don't ride the clutch) is it
possible I'm down to the rivets on the friction disk, and it's causing a
slipping or grinding before grabbing?  MB
