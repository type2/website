Sounds like a great series of articles.  It would be nice if someone who 
had them could make them available online, or at least let us know what 
months the articles were printed so we could look them up at the library.

&gt;I'm thinking about converting my 80 Westy AC to R134.
&gt;I'm guessing I need to change to barrier hoses, and
&gt;probably switch accumulators and go with a Sanden
&gt;compressors.  Anyone ever switch theirs to R134?

I switched my '73 to R134a.  You will need to make a decision about 
lubricant.  If I remember correctly, PAG is the stuff that eats the older 
seals/hoses.  It is also not tolerant of any of the old mineral oil in the 
system, whereas Ester is somewhat tolerant.

That said,  I have found that 134a will not cool as well as R12.  Typical 
vent temps are in the low 50's or high 40's, depending on the outside air 
temp.  It is way better than having a bus with no A/C but if you have a 
good working R-12 system now, I'd stick with it as long as you can.  If 
your system is empty, I'd check out Freeze-12.  I've had excellent luck 
with it in my Mustang using the stock R-12 system.  Didn't change anything 
except the dryer, didn't even flush it.  Just added the Freeze-12 and it 
cools very, very well - on par with the original R-12 refrigerant.
