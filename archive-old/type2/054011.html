Subject: mounting speakers up on the roof?? better left alone or tackle?

Hello,

I have a '75 bus non-camper that id like to put speakers in the back of. Im 
assuming it never had any before, as I cant think of even one decent spot 
for them.

So in the campers they have 6x9's mounted up on the roof right?

Is there a way to do this aftermarket? I have some of those old 6x9 generic 
speaker boxes I can put them into but how in the world do i attatch them up 
on the roof?

Any info would rock the box!
