Hello list!

I have been wanting a Volkswagen camper for many years, but they are extremely
rare here in Finland. Kombis and Kleinbusses are still around, but poptop
campers can be counted with fingers so I thought I'd never own one.. well,
today I drove home my new '70 VW camper - with poptop. 

The bus is rust free, which is pretty amazing for a finnish car. The interior
needs a lot of attention though. I think it's more than 10 years since it has
last been cleaned up!
But this is the intresting part. When I saw a picture of it, I thought it was
a Devon Eurovette camper, but it's not. In fact I have never heard of these
conversions before. There is a little plaque at the back which says:

Richard Holdsworth conversions

Anyone know anything about these? Seems that it came out as a panel van from
the factory, and mr Holdsworth or his co-workers installed windows, poptop
and camping interior.
Unfortunately the original manuals are missing, so I don't know anything
about it. I'd like to restore it to stock, but I don't know how it was
when new. All I know is the history of the bus. It was converted in England
and some english gentleman began touring the world with it. At the Pakistanian
border he did not get the visa to enter the country and so he sold the bus
right there for a finnish man who drove it to Finland (must have been quite
a roadtrip :). The year was 1976. In the 80's it had two other owners and
now it's mine - and I intend to keep it.

I saw a VW color chart somewhere in the net but can't remember where. Would
be helpful to know the color code of the bus. Can anyone point my browsers
to the right address?

One more question. Did '70 Kombis have a clovebox lid, or did they come without
one being fitted?

Thanks!
