Subject: Catching mouses...

Mouses.  In Yellowstone Park, our '73 Westie became infested with them.
Here's a hint:  carry mousetraps as standard OBE when camping in
national parks.  The meeses are considered part of the ecosystem, and
therefore none of the stores in any of the Parks carry Decon or sell
traps.  We tried Decon (obtained in Gardenier, outside the north
entrance...).  It killed the
meeses, eventually.  Don't believe the ads that say dead meeses killed
by Decon don't stink.  The Bus reeked for a month or so, until I finally
dissassembled the entire front passenger compartment and found dead
meeses who had made a nest in the inside-the-seat stuffing of the
passenger seat.  IMHO, traps with peanut butter are better (and the Park
stores DO sell peanut
butter...).  I now have four emergency mousetraps in a plastic bag,
stored in the 'way-back cabinet.
