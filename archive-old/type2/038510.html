Subject: First Oil Change On 71

Hello Everyone...Doing my first oil change today on my 71...any helpful 
hints? The guy I bought it from said he was running 10W40...but I am down 
here in Florida and I thought 20w50 would be better for the summer coming 
up...But I also have read somewhere on the net about not changing the weight 
of oil in these types of engines...If someone could give me some advice..I 
would really appreciate it...Just scrubbed the floors shiny...This bus is 
great!! Thanks again..Adam
