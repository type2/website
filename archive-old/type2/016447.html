&gt; installed- Is one of them really enough to keep all the people in my bus
&gt; (really, truly, honestly) warm?

      Well, the one in my '81 vanagon roasted me right out of the car in Feb,
coming down thru Kentucky and Tenn.  I mean, I had to turn it off, then on
once and awhile, then on again. OTOH, my Cor vair had a gas heater (not the
same make or model at all, but a gas heater nonetheless) which always quit
when it got really cold. Worked fine to about zero, then quit totally.  I
always figured it was some problem with water, but no amount of Heat ever
fixed it.
