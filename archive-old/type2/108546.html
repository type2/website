Subject: Re: [VB] Oil cooler question

Air flows from the fan, so where you can reach your hand into is the exit
for the departing air.

Anyone ever checked how much air actually comes out of that duct? I have,
and think of it as the equivelant of a mouse fart. It hits gentle breeze
status with the engine at 3500rpm, but it still isn't much. I was rather
disappointed after checking a few engines. OEM cooling tin too.  :-l
It's no wonder external oil coolers do so much for cooling the oil down.
