FWIW, I recently read that although you'll probably be able to literally
breathe a sign of relief about your tailpipe emissions, Hydrogen is largely
produced from oil and coal these days using industrial sources that produce
greenhouse gasses. So, we're almost back to square one if everyone all of a
a sudden drove a hydrogen powered car.

Back when I worked for an electric utility as a student we knew there was no
hope of electric cars taking off because there was no way to charge all of
them at once. Beyond environmental impacts such as building new dams, there
always seems to be a hidden negative to alternative solutions.
