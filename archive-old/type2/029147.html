Limited Bus content here, I am referencing the VW TDI diesel engine using
full synthetic oil.

yep oil analysis is popular over there also. Since we are talking diesels,
without a bypass filter the oil is black in less then 500 miles so lab
analysis is necessary to know what's really going on. An oil analysis at
the 10000 mile mark with the standard filter showed little to no metal
particles or contaminants in the oil and the oil was still in good shape.
There is a guy that went 50,000 (yes fifty thousand) miles on one oil
change (WITH A BYPASS FILTER and MOBIL1) and even at that point oil
analysis showed everything was OK.

take a look http://forums.tdiclub_dot_com/NonCGI/Forum5/HTML/000041.html

Bus content: Our Type4 engines run much hotter then the TDI (250 vs 190) so
oil may breakdown faster. If the oil isn't breaking down because you use
synthetic then filters still need to be changed and a bypass filter which
has a finer filtering mechanism is a good idea. YMMV

You can use 10k change intervals to make the warrenty period without a
problem. Very comforting if you trade-in for new ever 7 years. But that
engine will not last near as long if you make your lubrication changes
based upon inspection, not milage, which takes into account the way you use
the vehicle. Even changing oil/filter by a 3k rule of thumb is a less
efficient process than by inspection, if enhanced engine life means the
best chance for lowest cost per mile long past warrenty period.

Regarless what you put in there, verify it meets specifications as to
weight, composition and grade. Inspect it every month or 500 miles. Monitor
the transparency, color and feel. BEFORE it goes opaque, darkens beyond
heavy brown, begins to show a milky tint, feels too thin or feels like
grit, record the milage and change it.

If your motor is filthy inside from 10k interval lubes, check it at 100
miles after change to new oil with new unloaded detergent package. It will
be black already from the new detergents disolving the heavy buildup of tar
deposited by rule of thumb notions of prolonged maintenance based upon
assumptions, rather than factual inspection.

Results?? How do you know?? I had a Mercedes minor overhaul a while back. A
factory limited 4 cyl 16 valve 2.3 liter. 100K miles. Valve guides worn.
Carbon bui1d-up  The insides of the motor were as clean as the day it was
assembled. The cam lobes were brilliant. All the valves were in spec. The
soft guides saved every $80 spezial valve. Indeed, this vehicle can show
maintenance intervals that prove where these excellant results come from,
on a motor worth the price of a very nice T-II in better than average
condition.

Don't do oil changes at all. Do Lubrication Inspections. Inspec every fluid
in the vehicle at regular intervals determined by written records. Monitor
with paper and pencil, or set up a maintenance file on your wizbang PDA and
print out a hardcopy for backup. Keep records. Documented history is
essential to continuouse indefinate use without unnecessary failures.
