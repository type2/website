Subject: Paint Colors/Codes for '79 Bus

Hey All,

I'm getting ready to paint the '79 bus (manufactured 6/79).  It's 
red (but faded and scratched) on bottom, the roof and around the 
windows is white, but faded and a little bit rusted.

What are the names or codes for these two colors?  I found a sticker 
on the driver's door jamb that says:

     senegaltrot
       L31  A

     pastellweiB
       L90  D

Do the above words and codes have anything to do with paint color, 
or do they have something to do with the exhaust sytem or the 
birthdays of the guys who assembled this one?  (I know two or three 
words of German.)

TIA,


Roy
