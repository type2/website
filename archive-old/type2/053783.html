Subject: Gear oil question, just making sure

Not that I don't relish the thought of changing my tranny oil as often as
possible, but would our local lube expert please verify that I've got the
right stuff this time?  I put GL-5 in last time, time to drain it out, get
it right.  I've bought 3 qts of Sta-Lube Hypoid SAE 85W90 API/GL-4 (Part No.
SL24229 for what that's worth).  It looks right on the money to me (got it
&gt;from P*p B*oys), says it's not corrosive to bronze parts, but also says it's
OK for differentials requiring GL-3.  I suspect I'm being overcautious, but
how about a go/no go on this stuff?

Lovely thought:  it also causes cancer in California.  I'll be careful.

Thanks.
