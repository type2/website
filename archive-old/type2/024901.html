Subject: 79 Type2 Not starting after a long drive.

Hi again all,

I have another question.  Yesterday I drove my 79 for about 3 straight
hours.  I stopped the engine to unload some stuff, than I tried to start her
up again... and nothing happened.  I heard a little hum as I turned the key,
but the starter never kicked in.

This has happened before after long trips, and my mechanic said it was a
faulty starter-relay switch, which I replaced.  I had not had the problem
since than... but I also had not driven very far.

My guess was that the started had heated up and something had seized within
the starter motor.  I crawled under the bus last night and smacked the
starter with a hammer a few times.. got in the cab and cranked her right
over and she started right up.

Has anyone else seen this?  Ya think I need a new starter?? Or just keep a
hammer in the bus?
