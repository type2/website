John, list:
There's one of these on a shelf at the Ford/ VW dealer I've been working at
recently. I thought it looked pretty nice, but thought it was a Ford tool.
I'll take a type 2 ball joint along next time I go over there and see if it has
the right size cups and drivers and report back. This would easily save many
people $100 worth of work.
