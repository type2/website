Subject: Re: alternator problems.

ok, i have the alternator out now, but i need to get the pullie off (any
ideas) and there's a little black box that was screwed into the back of
the alternator with a wire that goes to the termonial on the left side
of the alternator, what is this? is it important, do i need to replace
it? thanks for bearing with me
