Subject: Re: [T2] Please take a moment to look

When i try to look through my stuff on 79 buses i dont find anything on 
camper stuff for it.  The only thing i can find is that there are two 16 
amp fuses in the panel,  If your wiring is similar to my 82 there will 
be a red wire and a white wire going to the kitchen area from the 
front.   The red  is the power lead and the white is the signal coming 
from the alternator to trigger the 12 volt relay so that you only use 
your 12v when the engine is running.  if by outlet you mean a 110AC type 
outlet  mine has a fuse built into the circuit back at the first outlet  
getting external AC power.  converter under the seat???

&gt; I am trying to make my sink, fridge and outlet work.
&gt; I am trying to replace the fuses first.
&gt; I have never seen a fuse like this one before.  The spring from the cap 
&gt; that holds the fuse in place has left a deep imprint of itself where it 
&gt; makes contact with the metal of the fuse.
&gt; Also, both the Bently manual and my VW owners manual say that my 79 bus 
&gt; should have 2 16 amp fuses under the dash.  However, they do not agree 
&gt; on the location of these fuses.
&gt; Any ideas?
