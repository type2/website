Subject: Re: [T2] starting and warm up

&gt;With all the Bosch Jetronics of the 1970s and early 80s, the way to
&gt;go is to turn the key to the start position for just an instant. 
&gt;Then turn to the off position. Then back to start and let it crank. 
&gt;I was taught this for Volvos -- the notion is that it &quot;charges up&quot; 
&gt;the fuel ring -- and it works equally well with my bus 

Mark is 100% correct on this.  But I don't think it applies to the L-Jet FI
system in buses.  My 914 and my 73 Westy both have D-jet FI and yes, the
correct method is as described above.  When the key is turned to the &quot;on&quot;
position the fuel pump powers up for 2 seconds in order to build pressure in
the lines.  The 2-second timer is, apparently, in the ECU.

I have a permanently mounted fuel pressure gauge in my 914 and can tell you
with certainty that after the car has sat overnight and the pressure has
bled down to zero that the first 2-second priming brings the pressure up to
about 20 psi (these systems are set for 28 psi constant).  So after you do
that once and then turn the key on the second time just prior to turning it
to the &quot;start&quot; position the pressure hits its mark.  And of course the pump
continues to pump during cranking.

If the car has been recently run you'll still have residual pressure in the
lines so you don't need the preliminary priming.

As I understand the bus L-Jet system, the starter must be cranking in order
for the pump to pump.  So priming the system as described above probably
doesn't do anything.
