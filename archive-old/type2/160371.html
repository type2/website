&gt; The mfr's booklet advises speed ranges:-

&gt; 		These are solid advice to prevent over-revving and (a

Robt,

While I agree with you on the &quot;drive by feel&quot; and &quot;adhere to the  
manufacturer's guidelines&quot; there are a couple additional factors.

Many of the transmissions in buses have been swapped, rebuilt, or  
otherwise fussed with, and the likelyhood of your bus having it's  
original gearing is...well, perhaps not as likely as you'd think.  So  
using a tach can help determine just what you've actually got  
connected to that shifter of yours...

You can also use your tach to get a good sense of how well you're  
cooling: there have been a number of folks who have posted anecdotal  
evidence that 2800-3200 RPM is something of an optimal range for the  
cooling system of a bus (fan revs vs. pushing the engine).  This is  
good stuff to know in the desert...

So yeah, there are better gauges to have, but a tach can be somewhat  
informative.

Cheers,
     Tom
