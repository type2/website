Subject: [T2] Nobody will believe this !

but it is true !!

I just installed a tach in the clock cavity ............
without removing the dash faceplate !!

It was a bear of a job !!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
Would this to be a bad time to say I have done this to my 1975 and will s=
oon do it to my 1978? I first did a dash in Tach back in my 1968 Beetle..=
.But of course you get in through the back. So congrats; I know how the j=
ob is!
