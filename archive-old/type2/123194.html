&gt; Hey... I had to hotwire my bus today, because the electric switch behind 
&gt; the ignition switch broke.  That was a good time in the parking lot of 
&gt; the bank for a few hours.  Anyway, i'm from the east coast, and when i 
&gt; need parts i buy from bus depot.  But now i'm living on the west coast
