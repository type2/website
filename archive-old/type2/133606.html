Subject: Re: [T2] Another Exhausting Question!

Tom

go to a muffler shop thats who sells this item.  you can by a antifouling
plug adapter at the FLAPS oxygen sensor and spark plugs have the same
diameter and thread pitch from what i have heard.  your problem then is
getting a plug to fit the hole unless you either make one, use a spark
plug, use a oxygen sensor.  the muffler shop on the other had will have
the oxygen sensor bung and the plug to fit it.  these items are also
available online if you look hard enough.

as for putting some other pipe or nut there the problems is that the
equipment that you would want to connect there i.e. exhaust gas analyer or
a back pressure gauge would need to be adapted to your &quot;custom&quot; thread.
most of this equipment comes with threads to go into oxygen sensor ports.
as compared to that older style port that the vanagons and such had.
