&gt; The adaptor bracket bolts to the Stock oil pump cover plate and one
case 
&gt; mating fastener underneath it. Sometimes you 
&gt; have to lengthen the oil pump cover studs.
Since he has the mounting bosses on the case, all he has to do is to
drill and tap them for the rear mount bar.  No sense doing a
Mickey-Mouse installation when a few bucks worth of tools will do it
the right way.  The tools would probably cost less than the &quot;adapter&quot;.
 Also, if the bosses are present, they will probably interfere with
the adapter.


Perhaps, but I'm relating my experience, and the adaptor plate has always 
worked
fine for me. I don't consider it 'mickey mouse' and maybe it's an easier 
option for 
someone who just wants to get down the road.
