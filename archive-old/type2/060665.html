Subject: Total Seal's gapless piston rings
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

In my quest to build a great bus engine, I have been advised to use gapless
piston rings by Total Seal. The benefits are supposed to be less blow-by and
more efficient combustion. Does anyone have any experience with these piston
rings and are they worth the $'s for a daily driver? TIA TBear
