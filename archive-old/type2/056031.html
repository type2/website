Subject: Fix for leaky valve cover

Because of the bulkier heaterbox, the Type 4 engines are harder to play
with the valve cover....the gasket can &quot;walk&quot; off its lip, or the cover can
&quot;walk&quot; off the head lip (more common).  Use a brake tool to walk the clip
up the cover while you insert a 2x4 between top of cover and body just
above the head- this prevents it from sliding up and leaving a gap.  If
it's too tight to use a brake tool, I have also levered a board or crowbar
against the heaterbox below while using it to push the clip up.
   Did you clean the lip in the valve cover completely if PO used gasket
cement?  Some do glue the gasket to the cover (never to the head) to
prevent it walking.  I hate scraping, so I use a film of greas to hold it
there while carefully tipping the cover over the head and feeling by
sliding it side to side that I am over the lip of the head.
