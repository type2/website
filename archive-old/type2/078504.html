Subject: Bryant Baecht lives!

For those interested: Bryant Baecht stopped at my
house in Salt Lake about midnight last night to pick
up a rear seat.

(He's enroute from Kansas to Calif.)

It was bitterly COLD--19 degrees and snowing. And even
his coleman blackcat with a 5-gal tank wasn't taking
the edge off inside the '65 splittie. The good news is
that the bus was running like a champ.

We loaded the seat and he headed off on I-80 towards
Wendover, Nev. with plans to stop at a motel somewhere
in Utah.

He's my hero...
