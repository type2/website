After research I went to local VWFlaps to see what he had. 
I ended up with outer bearings (283) South American in a box that said 'An
FAG company&quot; for 15.50. Thats very cheap.
Inners (287) for 7.50. About typical. Chinese but pretty healthy looking.
So for the whole collection for both sides ~61.00
I remember Dave Jerseys ranting about how the Timkins failed him. All
of these bearings look very sturdy. No plastic carriers or anything.
Ill probably try to do at least the worst side this weekend.
