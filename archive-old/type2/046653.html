&gt;is going on here?

Waiting anxiously for any answers here. Both our running uprights...71 SC 
and 69 KG...are frustrating in the oil-check department. I stick the damn 
stick in 6 times and come up with 5 readings (so of course I go with the 2 
that are the same). Don't have this problem with the pancakes. What gives? 
Thanks..
