Subject: desperate! need oil filler tube

Hey list!  Well, I still need an oil filler tube for my bus. I have been 
looking now for over a month a have found nada.  I have rigged the  j-tube 
with a plug that works for now, but their are problems with that rig  also.  
This morning I forgot to put the plug in and when I got to the gas  station 
wow you should have seen the mess! Then this afternoon the plug came off 
going down the interstate.  I looked back and saw a cloud behind me! I 
thought ... oh no....ive burned a piston, but it was just the oil on the 
manifold causing it. Boy I looked like oo7 though with that smoke screen!  
The oil filler tube is for an 80 2.o part # 070 115 308. If anyone know the 
whereabouts of one of these PLEASE let me know! I appreciate your help!
