Robert, Bob:
Actually, ATF would clean out a trans pretty good, but it's a little weak on
hypoid lube ability. One could probably just put a couple of quarts into the
transaxle and leave the car up on stands while running the engine and trans thru
the gears for a few minutes, then drain it back out. ATF is really high in
detergents.
Having said that, I'm not sure why this would ever be necessary. As one who has
taken apart (and put back together) over a hundred manual tranmissions, they just
don't get that dirty inside. Chunks of metal, but most trannies have magnetic
drain plugs for that.

&gt; &gt; Question: I just drained the oil out of my '73 (acquired last year, so have
&gt; &gt; no idea how often, if at all, this oil was ever changed) and it was very
&gt; &gt; dirty.  Before filling it up with Amsoil and putting it back in the vehicle
&gt; &gt; (it's out at this time), should I flush it with something to get the crud
&gt; &gt; out?  If so, what should I use to flush?
&gt;
&gt; If I think it needs a flush I fill it with the same tranny fluid I plan on
&gt; using, drive a couple hundred miles then drain and refill.
&gt;
&gt; auto tranny this is just about the final drive, auto tranny fluid is
&gt; treated differently.
