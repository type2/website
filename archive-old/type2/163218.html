Subject: Re: [T2] Oil cooler as heat source inside van.

In a message dated 12/18/06 9:29:59 PM, courtneyhook_at_shaw_dot_ca writes:


&gt; I was reading the archives and came across a post about putting an oil 
&gt; cooler
&gt; inside the van to act as a heat source. With a blower behind it, it would be
&gt; more efficient than water. My now gone hero, the famous Mike West answered
&gt; that it would be a daunting mechanical challenge. Has anyone ever pulled 
&gt; this
&gt; off, or tried it? I wonder if it would work in cold weather with 10-30 wt.
&gt; without blowing the oil filter off to move the oil up front through 12ft. 
&gt; oil
&gt; lines and back again?? You would need a way to shut it off too in the summer
&gt; when you don't want the heat?

It was a Warshawsky (and Co. not V. I. ) product for Beetles and mounted in 
the
package shelf...But not for the Bus...;-(
