&gt; Hello Mike     This isnt quite right   I said without a full flow 
&gt; filter it isnt 

I understood that -- that's Bob Hoover's position, too. A Type 1 engine 
without full-flow filtration needs to have its oil changed at very 
frequent intervals regardless of whether the oil is petroleum or 
synthetic. Modern engines with full-flow filtration can go for much for 
longer intervals on synthetic oil (when compared to ancient seabed oil) 
without a change, making the synthetic quite cost-effective. A stock 
Type cannot take advantage of this superior quality of synthetic oil. 
But if the synthetic can operate at the elevated temps of an aircooled 
engine on a hot day without breaking down and causing more friction, 
that's cost-effective in my book.
