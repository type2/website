Well, the guy gets the &quot;flowery ad copy of the day&quot; award.  Definitely has
that &quot;ebay&quot; smell to it.

I guess the 2L engine with kadrons and blooey muffler was a rare option in
'69!  :)

&quot;Near one of a kind metal pressings&quot; in the top?  Isn't that a
self-negating statement?

Doesn't the &quot;super rare industrial model dash&quot; live underneath the padding

The white glove compartment door doesn't ring true, and what utility bus
came with 2-tone seats?

I love the way that he used 150+ words to say &quot;10K Cash, Firm.&quot;

Nice bus, and might be worth 10K if it was truly original.  It would take
quite a bit of work to get this one back that way.
