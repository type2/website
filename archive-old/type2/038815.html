Subject: stupid owner/engine

I don't know how it happened...I checked the oil just
4 days ago... I was driving down the road, it stalled,
i thought it was a loose battery terminal...the
mechanic said those 3 little words, &quot;engines
shot...sorry&quot;.   He said there was no oil in the
engine, i saw no telltale signs.  Now I have a great
camper that is sitting in the shop...

How much should I expect to pay for a replacement for
a 71 westy?  I have no idea, just don't want to get
ripped off.  Thanks for any assistance you can give
me.  &quot;sniff&quot;

Sincerely, 

Brokenhearted
