Subject: I Finally Got My Bus....

Thanks to all for the great advice and sincere help I received from you
guys on the Type 2 list.  Even if I never found a bus, I would enjoy 
reading all the great mail and infomative discussions that go on with
this group of VW people.

But I did get my bus!  I finally purchased a light yellow 1981 Westfalia
Deluxe from a nice older gentleman in Atlanta.  After searching through
Webpage after Webpage of classifieds, reading the for-sale items 
listed here, newspaper classified and such, I am glad to be finished 
with the business of getting it and now I'm not sure what to do next!
My entire life for the past month has been the search for THE bus
and now it is mine, parked outside.

Mr. Zumbro  was asking $3000.00 for this one.  He came down to $2500.00
because I am going to have to have some engine work done.  It is
an automatic with 119,000 miles.  He put in a really good new battery,
replaced a broken turn light, replaced the halogen fog bulbs, and 
even had the fridge cold with bottled lemonade in it for the ride home!
(He did all this AFTER we had made the deal). 

He really liked this bus, but he had a 1989 with air parked right beside
it so I am sure he won't miss it too much.

One of the neatest things about the Camper was the surprise under-
neath the purple-looking brown nylon upholstery  (It was UUUGGGLLY!). 
After we got home with it yesterday I noticed this stuff was sewn with plain
thread around the edges of the front seats and stapled around 
the fold-down bed in the back.   The back cushion covering the 
motor had this ugly stuff on it, too.  When I peeled back the material 
they had used to cover the original material, low and behold, there 
was the perfect original upholstery underneath without a single tear!  

Mr. Zumbro  had kept the bus in great shape and was meticulous in all
his repairs as he did most of the engine/transmission rebuilding and
upkeep himself.  This bus has been to Alaska and back and might
get back there again some day, I hope.  

I would like to thank Joe Fournier, Ken Hooper, Mike West, 
Surfer Bob, John Pretalion, Mike Perry and Ron Van Ness for their
helpfulness and encouragement!  Also, Joel Walker deserves a 
special thanks for giving his e-mail opinion  about the VWs
I unearthed in my search and answering all my questions that I 
didn't want to the entire List with. Thanks for the pile of information
from the archives, Joel!

I love this list! (And my new Westy!)
