 Thanks to all who had hints on changing the starter bushing.
Dave, Brian, Sandra, and Westy Driver.=20
I finally had time to change it out this morning after work.

 For the record, the procedure was:
1. Thread the inside of the old bushing with a 12mm tap.
2. Remove the bushing with a long 12mm bolt, ( long 12mm wrench
    around the shaft, and against the head for tapping with a small =
hammer)
3. Tape new bushing to a 10mm socket and extension, tap in with same
     hammer.
4.  Get four hours sleep.
5.  Open sunroof, load a bunch of kids, apply ice cream.

  Thanks list friends,  Jak  =20
