&gt; Hmmm... The VERY FIRST thing I would do is take off the ground strap from
&gt; the battery and clean the bejezus off the body where the ground strap
&gt; attaches. And then clean the bejezus off the ground strap. Make them so
&gt; shiny you can see your reflection! And then do the same to the negative post
&gt; on the battery and the cable.

*EXCELLENT* advice!  In addition, the one everyone neglects becasue it is
hidden is the trans to chassis strap.  The amazing thing is that this is
the only dedicated ground connection between the engine/trans assembly and
the body (and battery)!  look under the driver's side toward the  front of
the trans for a braided strap, like the OEM ground strap to the battery.

There are number of &quot;incidental&quot; paths, but the motor mounts on a bus are
all insulated by rubber shock bushings and if the trans ground strap is
not connected, funny things can happen.
