Great.  VWoA is going nuts.  Just wait.  All these movies we have seen
that have VW's that make cameo appearances will probably be &quot;fixed&quot;,
leaving VW Bus, Bug, and Ghia shaped holes where they &quot;removed&quot; the
trademarked item.    

Gee... this email contains the letters VW right next to each other.  Are
we gonna have to start referring to our VW's as &quot;Those that must not be
named?&quot;

My cafepress sites got shut down, along with any other ones with an
image of a VW in it.

Here's one of the images I was using:

Totally created by me, no VW logo or anything. Complete B.S.
