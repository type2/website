Subject: Smog and Camping

Just wanted to let everybody know how I passed the smog here in
California.  Some might call it cheating but it worked and this is on an
engine that is in bad need of a rebuild.  Compression low on #3 and
leaks more oil than I'd like to admit.  It's a 77 2.0L FI.  I went to
napa and got myself two catalytic converters.  I took the bus to a
custom exhaust shop and told them to put the converters where the heat
exchangers are.  After that was done I went to a smog shop that was
willing to let me dial in the CO mixture before I went to another shop
for the test (I had to go to a test only shop.)  Anyhow, I went from
being a gross polluter failing everything except the CO mixture to
passing with average numbers according to the state.  The bus is running
great after tuning in the mixture and there is no longer a terrible
exhaust smell.
Also took my first road/camping trip in the bus this weekend just to
stretch her legs out a bit.  This was also my first camping trip in a
bus and I can't even describe how much fun it was!!!  I was able to
maintain 65 mph up most hills here in SoCal and only slowed to around
50-55 on the steeper ones.  The whole trip was 289 miles at 21.23 miles
per gallon.  Engine ran cool the entire time and my mysterious irregular
idle problem has seemed to fix itself.
I think I'm one of the happiest bus owners around right now!!
