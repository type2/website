I got mine a couple of years ago from VW Heritage
(http://www.garlands_dot_uk_dot_com/vw/).  It cost something like 5 or 6 pounds.  It
would be very useful to have some sort of cross reference to the actual part
numbers, I suspect this might be a 'dealer only' thing.  It makes ordering a
lot easier if you can just quote a part # instead of trying to describe the
thing over the phone (often to be told &quot;There's no such thing&quot;).
