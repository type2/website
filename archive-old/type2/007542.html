hey fellow wageners,

i'm a newbie, i just bought a '72 westy, great body,engine and mint 
interior.

i was just wondering if anyone could help me out in my dillema. i live 
in lethbridge,alberta,canada, and in the morning it's starting get to 
cold to start my van. i went to a dealer and asked about the choke, a 
mechanic said i would have to loosen it or tighten it, it was one of the 
two, i just forget wich one. anyways i need to know a simple and 
effective way of doing this job. if anyone has any info please reply.

thanks kenny aitkens
