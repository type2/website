Subject: Friday-Deadheads and busses

I have been doing a very UN-scientific, informal sociologocal study over the last few years of Deadheads, bus owners, and other totally trivial stuff.  My findings are as follows:  1) Deadheads in general are NOT bad bus owners, but the younger the bus owner\deadhead, the worse shape they keep their bus in.  2)If you are considering buying a bus from a Deadhead, first ask them what their favorite Grateful Dead song is or which GD song first got them into the scene, If they answer &quot;Touch of Grey&quot;, run away as fast as you possibly can and don't look back. 3)Don't buy a bus from someone with both Grateful Dead stickers AND PHISH stickers in the window, it will almost certainly not have been tuned up in the past year.  4)Don't buy a bus from a Deadhead (or anyone else for that matter) who has advertised the bus as either a &quot;Shaggin Wagon&quot; or a &quot;Hippie Bus&quot; or &quot;Dead Sled&quot;, because they have obviously missed the point. 5) When buying a bus from a Deadhead, you can add five kharma po!
ints for every GD Show that the bus has been at, but take away 2 points for every PHISH concert which it has attended.  And lastly 6)When buying a bus from a Deadhead, ask them for a beer, if they offer you a mass produced domestic lite beer, be on your way.  If they give you a nice full bodied micro or good import, start talking about the bus, if they give you a nice Amber Ale that they home-brewed themselves, then take your new bus home and enjoy it for years!!
Just 2 cents worth from a rapidly approaching middle age tie-dye wearing deadhead who treats his buses right!!!
