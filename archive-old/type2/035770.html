&quot;Customer service is not a department,
it's an attitude&quot;
&gt;
&gt; List,
&gt; Everyone around here looks at me sideways when i show them the o-ring from
&gt; inside my type4 oil pump. They say it is and odd size and they don't stock
&gt; it - its the cross-sectional diameter that is the problem.
