&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;         I have a type IV built using head gaskets.  I have one side apart
&gt;replacing a bad cylinder-piston.  Would you put it back together with new
&gt;head gaskets on that side or replace them with the VWSB recommended base
&gt;shim. I would rather not pull the other side and do the switch on that
&gt;side as well.  The compressions are fine on that side and they are dry and
&gt;tight. thanks. jon


Here's the official tech bulletin from VW on this subject.

That being said, I would keep the worked on side the same as what ever is 
on the other side.
