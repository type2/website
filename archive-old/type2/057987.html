Subject: Stupid Vanagon Starter Question

Good Morning Volks,

The Vanagon list is down. (Murphy's Computing Law #1024; When the
list admin leaves town, the list shall go down...) So I'm hoping
that some of the Vanagon experts are lurking around here.

Problem:  Need manual starter.  Funds are a bit low at the
moment.  Have Automatic starter.  It is apparently not a straight
bolt in (Tried that.  Spins but doesn't engage flywheel.) but can
I mix and match parts and end up with a starter that will work?

Any suggestions welcome.
