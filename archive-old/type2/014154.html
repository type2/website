Subject: Nose damage.

List,
I'd like an opinion on the nose damage on this 71 bus i've got.
I'd like to just get a general opinion about this from a body person - th=
e
'metwiz' comes to mind, but i'd appreciate comments from anyone who has b=
een
into this.
Finally - i would like to try to get a ballpark amount on a repair.
Pics of the bus are at =

Thanks and please pmail me for more info.
