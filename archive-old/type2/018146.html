&gt;Chris, Chuck: 
&gt;I think I'd drain and flush the fuel tank and probably have to take the carb 
apart and clean it out too. Then of course the brakes
&gt;will be totally toast. Every hydraulic cylinder will be rusted. At least 
that's how it is here in the midwest. Sitting is much harder on
&gt;brakes because the accumulated water in the brake fluid never gets boiled 
off! Making a long-time non-runner driveable again is
&gt;a big piece of work. Al Brase 
&gt;69 double cab 


let my try that again....I wouldn't replace the brakes, or remove the carb or 
drain the fuel tank. I always assume nothing is wrong. 
I would see if the engine spins by hand. If it does I'd pour some fresh gas 
in, charging the battery, spray some super start and let
it rip. No point in doing work not connected with starting the motor. If you 
get the motor running, then worry about stopping the bus.
my 2 cents
