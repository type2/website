&gt;There is a small dime sized metal heat sensor on the case of the engine that
&gt;either gets a hole in the middle or falls off if the engine is overheated.
&gt;GEX will use this as evidence that you incorrectly installed the engine
&gt;causing it to overheat and fail, so you need pictures of a properly
&gt;installed engine to back up your claim.

 
 I was speaking to a VW mechanic friend of mine only recently about
 the metal heat sensors and their use to claim an engine has been
 overheated by dubious commercial engine builders.

 He said that an air-cooled engine will generally run hot enough during
 normal use with all cooling tin etc. in place to melt off the heat
 sensors anyway.
 Sounds like just a slimy way to void the warranty of any engine when
 it fails after a short service life.

 But I confess no first hand experience here,it's just what I've been
 told...
