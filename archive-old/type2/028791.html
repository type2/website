&gt; Also, Ron at BD, could you please pmail me with your pitch and pricing for
&gt; converting to this to the earlier/'79 federal exhaust system.


Okay...

Convert it to the 72-74 setup. Put '72-74 heat exchangers and exhaust on
it..  $179 buys you a complete exhaust system with a stainless steel
muffler.  You can replace both heat exchangers for $349 (one side German one
side Danish) or $399 (both sides NOS German, worth the difference).  You
will have to do minor cooling tin fabrication, and disable your EGR filter,
otherwise everything bolts right up.   This not only eliminates the
no-longer-available crossover pipe, but also the no-longer-available header
pipes and U-pipes from the heads to the heat exchangers.  This may seem like
a lot of money, but wait 'til you need one of those unavailable parts and
waste days trying to find one only to pay $$$ for a used one that in turn
rusts out in a year.  Believe me, the smart move is to get out of this
&quot;bastard&quot; setup altogether and switch to parts that are commonly available
new.  Plus you get new heat exchangers in the process.

Bottom line is, sooner or later (probably sooner) the cost of continuously
trying to replace no-longer-available '75-78 exhaust/heat exchanger parts
with used parts (which in turn will soon rust through because they're
already used) will  _far_ exceed the cost of just switching to the more
common setup to begin with. It's a case of pay some money now, or a ton of
money in the long run.  Just switch to the readily-available earlier setup
and be done with it.

Check the archives, you'll find a ton of references that back up my
position.
