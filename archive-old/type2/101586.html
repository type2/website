Subject: Re: [T2] License Light Question

&gt; What is the difference between 68-71 and 72-79 license plate lights?

The length of them are different. Somewhere I wrote down the measurements from screw hole to screw
hole but I have not found them yet. If I remember right, the early ones are 130mm from
center-to-center. Late ones are 140mm from center-to-center.

&gt; Can the former be used on the latter&gt;

No. See above.
