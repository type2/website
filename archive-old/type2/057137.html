Subject: Re: Timing marks on '81 Westy

It's a very small notch on the rear rim of the pulley. It might be
full of dirt and even harder to see. Sometimes it's easier to pull the
coil wire off the distributor, and hand turn the engine with the key on
until the coil sparks, then you know the mark is somewhere around the 0
mark on the scale so you can find it easily and mark it with a piece of
chalk.
