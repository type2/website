&gt;Folks:  My '82 Vanagon gets _at_ 11.5 mpg in stop-and-go, urban (&amp; hilly) 
&gt;driving.  I was aghast in the beginning but, as indicated by Mike, this 
&gt;seems to be in the ballpark for the circa 2L engine under these 
&gt;conditions.  Cheers, Art McGinn

Can that be true?  I don't have any first-hand experience with that model,
but that kind of fuel consumption seems excessive for ANY two-liter four-cyl.
