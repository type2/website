Hi Howard.
    Have you tried following Bentley's trouble shooting systematically?

&gt;Hello All!
&gt;Well it's nearly two weeks since my Leisel started and I've replaced the
&gt;following: coil, plugs(twice), rotor, distributor, points, condensor, plug
&gt;wires, and distributor cap. Also put in another double relay, and so far
all
&gt;Ive succeeded in getting out of the old girl is a backfire or two. I know
&gt;she's out of time, but with this 2000cc FI, how can I set it without having
&gt;it at least running? I love this bus and am not willing to sell out just
&gt;because of these problems since she set for almost one year idle before I
&gt;bought it and the only thing replaced by the PO was the cap and rotor. All
&gt;or any tips will be greatly appreciated.
