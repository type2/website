Subject: Starter Nut
Message-ID: &lt;000901beb2fa$0831c480$189a0e3f_at_oemcomputer&gt;

Am I the only brain surgeon out there who has stripped the nut on the main
terminal on his bus's starter solenoid?  I don't know if it's the nut or the
stud that is stripped, I just want to remove it!!!  Any ideas?  I don't
think there's enough room to get in there with a Dremel &amp; I'm not sure
there's enough slack on the wires to pull the starter with them attached.
Can I pull the starter out enough to maneuver with all the wires
connected???  Oh, yeah, '75 Westfalia with '73 engine, manual trans.  Also -
how many bolts connect the starter to the bell housing?  I can't feel any
more than the one on the bottom.  Bentley isn't much help on this - the
pictures don't show a good angle and it's not budging with just the bottom
nut removed.

While I'm down there, I have another question.  There's a red/yellow wire
(small gauge) that looks like it should connect to the solenoid, but it
doesn't show up on the wiring diagram.  Could this go to my Eberspacher
(I've never removed the bottom pan to check out the gas heater - po said he
disconnected it because it made him nervous).  Can someone confirm this for
me?  I think that I'll connect this wire if I ever get the nut off the
starter.  I'll just disconnect the heater at the switch until I have time to
examine it.

Thanks in advance,
