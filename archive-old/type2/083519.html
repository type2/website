&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; I came up with the idea of a &quot;water injection system&quot; which goes something
&gt; like this:  A windshield washer reservoir on the left-side battery tray with
&gt; a low-pressure pump that could be actuated by a momentary switch on the
&gt; dash.  A hose runs from the reservoir to the tin in front (RIF) of the fan,
&gt; where water would drip onto the tin and get sucked into the fan.  Water
&gt; droplets would either flash into steam or get atomized by the fan, get blown
&gt; over the cylinders, and add humidity and density to the cooling air.
&gt;
&gt; It all seems to work (in theory), but I'm sure there are problems with
&gt; localized cooling and different rates of metal expansion and contraction.
&gt; Anybody care to jump in on this one?

What you are creating here is an evaporative cooler for your engine.
Certainly a viable concept.

Your engine rejects about 100Kw of heat, or 100,000J/s.  It takes 2259000J
to vaporize a kilogram (liter) of water.  Therefore, the heat output of
your engine is capable of vaporizing a liter of water in about 23
seconds if the water is the only source of cooling.

Of course, you're just supplimenting the cooling of the air, so you won't
need nearly so much water, but I don't think that a windshield washer
reservoir and pump will last long.

The motorhome people have systems that spray water on their radiators to
cool their engines on grades, but they are pulling water from large tanks
in their vehicles.
