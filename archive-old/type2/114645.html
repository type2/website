Subject: Re: [T2] How do I connect laptop to cell to get list messages?

Mike,

I had great success using a Sprint PCS phone and a USB cable that I had to
buy through Ebay - Sprint had discontinued this cable because it circumvents
their $300 pcmcia card solution.  I am able to surf cross-country at about
14.4kbps for no extra charges.
Best info I found was:

Good luck!
Sean

&gt; We finally had to change our ancient cell phones for modern tri-mode

&gt; I wanted the cheapest phones with the ability to connect a modem adaptor

&gt; the map program and DVD watching.  So got these Kyocera phones (2 for
&gt; $30) and a kit I wonder about - it's a connector for a USB port (we
&gt; have) and software for their own Express Office network or any other
&gt; ISP.  It would not work with the IBOOK (Mac) we have for business
&gt; trips.  Is there NO adaptor that is modeled after the old &quot;stick it over
&gt; the mouthpiece/earpiece&quot; of a phone to let one connect the handshaking
&gt; of your modem to the phone connection established when you dial up the
&gt; ISP?  On an old computer with a failing modem, I'd have to dial the
&gt; number manually on a house phone, listen for the handshake and then
&gt; stick the jack into the modem to satisfy the dial Up networking
&gt; program.   Heck, I might design my own modeled to the the cell earphone
&gt; jack-has anyone heard of this or knows of a simpler adaptor...
