Subject: Nuts, Bolts, &amp; my Dad is still alive. (LONG - little VW content)

I've spent the past week sorting, sorting, sorting and I'm starting to 
get tired of it but it's just gotta be done.  I've had this rummage bin 
full of nuts, bolts, washers, you-name-it, and I get tired of killing 
loads of time trying to find what I want.  There is quite a collection of 
nuts, bolts, and washers in my garage - enough to fill 2 - 5 gallon 
buckets and then some.  But now it's all pretty much sorted so I can 
quickly grab what I need at a moment's notice.  Thank God my dad is still 
alive.  (You're probably thinking I've gone nuts by changing the topic so 
abruptly...it all ties in though, just hang on...)

It all goes back to the early 1980's.  My dad was self-employed as a 
janitor cleaning local banks, law offices, pipeline offices, etc.  Bless 
his heart he's done pretty darn good providing for us kids as we grew 
up.  An 8th grade education is hard on a fella.  My dad is deaf and when 
he attended Omaha School for the Deaf in the 50's, the curriculum just 
wasn't what it should have.  I am sure his interest in basketball didn't 
help him much with his education but he did make it to 8th grade.  Later 
on he got married and started a family.  Eventually, I came to be 12 years 
old... 

Then there was &quot;the accident&quot;.

We don't talk about it much anymore because it's in the past and well, 
quite frankly, it was tad scary for us all.  One day as dad took our 
1968 Ford Galaxie to his cleaning job, he had an epileptic seizure.  He 
was 48 years old and he hadn't had a &quot;fit&quot; since he was 12 years old.  
But sure enough, 36 years later it came back to haunt him, on a hill, in 
the car, while he was driving, a block and a half from a red light.  From 
Dad's perspective, all he knew is one minute he was in the car and the 
next instant he's in a hospital feeling pretty rotten.  What had elapsed 
in the brief moment for him was pretty amazing.  He fell over in the seat 
so that the car appeared driverless (which it was anyway), reached over 
70mph in a 35mph zone, and sailed through a red light (didn't hit anyone 
either).  The car hit the curb (it was a T-intersection), flew 90 
feet while reaching an altitude of 6 feet, missed 2 big gasoline storage 
tanks by 6 inches, went down in a ditch, came back up and hit a 
stationary railroad tanker car.  (Later we got the bill from Union 
Pacific to put their car back on the track because dad derailed it from 
the force of the impact.)  In the end, Dad ended up with a real big gash 
in his knee, a beat up face, and a body that rivaled the bruised torsos 
often found in a boxing ring.

But after that episode, Dad has just never been quite with it.  

I have found notebooks in the garage of his, that contain house-wiring 
diagrams, sparkplug wire orders for Ford engines, &amp; patterns for various 
&quot;who-knows-what-it-was-for&quot; creations.  And dad does not know who drew 
them, more or less understand them.   Past 60 now, he still 
continues to do his cleaning work and go to Taco Johns for his daily dose 
of Dr. Pepper.  

&quot;But, No Quarter,&quot; you may ask, &quot;what has all this got to do with sorting 
nuts and bolts, pray tell?&quot;

Following the accident, dad would take things from people's garbage and 
bring them home.  He'd never done this before so we guessed it to be 
something that was brought about by the blow he sustained to his head.
He'd either 1)  Stick it in the garage and forget about 
it, 2)  tear it apart and toss all the parts in a 5 gallon bucket, 3)  
hide it and forget where he put it.  It didn't help things either that a 
cohort of his would come over and offer him $20 for the junk which 
literally filled the garage...a paltry sum offered in pittance for 
*HOURS* worth of &quot;work&quot; in a lame attempt to offer solace for my dad's 
new-found fascination with old rejected appliances.  This just encouraged 
my dad and it got so bad, that he had to stop because he had no place to 
put his junk.  But after he got that $20, he set out to fill the garage 
again.  Time after time it happended.  Was there no end???

Finally in August of 1991 (a tad over a year after I graduated), I 
decided I needed to set up shop.  I took command of the garage, took 
command of my grandfather's trailer and in 3 days and 2 1/2 trailer loads 
later, I had a garage fit for a king.  You could actually see the back 
wall &amp; (drum roll please) you could walk through it!  In all, a good 18 
hours was involved but by gum, I could work now!!!  
 
I now have enough nuts, bolts, lockwashers, fender washers, circlips, 
kotter keys, springs, eye-bolts, AC cords, outlets, junction boxes, wire, 
etc. to last a lifetime.  Although everthing is standard sized, and it 
has taken me this long to get around to sorting out the buckets, boxes, 
cubby's full of nuts/bolts/washers, I now have so much of it &amp; it's all  
organized, that I've felt I've made some great progress in my little 
humble shop.  It just goes to show that if you take the time to sort 
things and organize (I'm an organization freak) a bit, it goes a long way 
towards conserving time and most importantly, makes room for all them 
V-Dub parts.

And it's all because my Dad is still alive...
