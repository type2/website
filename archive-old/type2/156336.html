Subject: Re: [T2] Idle crankcase fumes

How about the valve guides?
What was the status of the heads? new, rebuilt?


&gt; Maybe the rings, which should be offset on the gaps, have aligned
&gt; themselves, and thus you have your ring gaps allowing excessive blowby on a
&gt; cylinder.  All will appear OK with all diagnostics, but oil will blow by the
&gt; gaps.

&gt; &gt; So far I was told i have blow by and therefore something in the engine
&gt; &gt; stinks. I need to open it to check it out, all the hard work...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Are there no folks to tell me that my engine is OK, including the
&gt; &gt; rings ? Any one has this also happening for a long time ?  Why would
&gt; &gt; rings go in 800 miles ? Come on 70mph next to a semi isn't that bad
&gt; &gt; for 3 minutes.
