Subject: Looking for 71 Westy or bus in California
Message-ID: &lt;000201bf2ad3$28b9e240$94d81004_at_anonymous&gt;

Hello all,
I'm new to the list and am trying to pick up a running 71 Wesphalia or Van
at a reasonable price. I've owned 7 or 8 campers and Busses in the past and
almost as many Bugs. My last few include a stock 71 Westphalia which I paid
$800 for, another 71 Westie with an 1835 for $750, and a 70 van with an
engine that sat full of water for 9 months for $175. (Got it running in one
day) Also a stock 61 bug and a dropped 66 bug. I live in Stockton, Ca and
there aren't many to choose from around here. I work in a large bike shop
and have no transportation but the bike at this time. Rainy season is upon
us and a Westphalia would be just the ticket to keep me dry and to get me to
some decent areas to ride on my days off. What I'm looking for is something
that runs in the $500-$1000 range. I can go higher for a very clean camper.
Sacramento and San Francisco are close but I'm willing to travel just about
anywhere in California for a deal. Please respond to the list or e-mail me
at johnqpublic_at_netzero_dot_net
Thanks in advance for any help
JQP
