Subject: Engine lid sealing

Hi all,
Just having a debate here about the effects of driving a Kombi with a stock
type 4 motor and the engine lid propped open.
Has anyone ever taken readings to compare head and oils temps with it open and
closed?
And while I'm at it, has anyone compared the time to reach operating temp with
and without a connected thermostat?
Just curious.
Thanks,
Richard,
Brisbane Australia.
