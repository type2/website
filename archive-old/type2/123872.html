Subject: Re: [T2] Decison  -opinions needed

Do I go ahead and do the motor in mine? Or save the money and sell my bus
for a little, adding the amounts together.. raising a little more and buy
the nice
sparkly one?

Take it from someone who's currently working on restoring their THIRD
Westy-buy the good one and go out and start enjoying it now! Unless you really
like working on vehicles, it is far more cost effective to buy something
decent than to put lots of $$ and time into something you may never be
satisfied with. Been there-done that-too many times! Just my .02.   Jeff
