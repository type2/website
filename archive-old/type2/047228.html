Subject: [T2] Gas Heater

Is it hard to retrofit a gas heater into a westy that has never had one?
I will be taking the one out of a bus this weekend so I should be able
to see, just thought I'd ask. Food for thought, I got this 72 westy with
heater, side step and all running gear for $100.00, it also has a
console in the middle, it looks like it has original westy wood
paneling, did Westafalia ever have a center console? Bays are still out
there cheep with good parts, get 'em while you can. It's too fare gone
to save so I should have body panels available latter in the month if
any one needs something, let me know.
