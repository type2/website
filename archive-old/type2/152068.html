&gt; &lt;Would work well in this town too. Prob is how to stay warm in the winter and

&gt; The heat can be solved with several alternative electric heaters, but they cut
&gt; into your range. The cold issue is a problem if you get below freezing for a
&gt; long time. From my reading, I think the cold is not an issue in VA, except for

for heat you use an eber gas heater, for as little gas as they use it
would be one or two tanks a year unless you live in Greenland.

&gt; the decrease range. I do 40 mile round trip with hills and 4 red lights. All
&gt; highway driving. Talking to the guys at electro automotive a rabbit designed
&gt; to do 80 miles flat will cover me on my trip since it is all highway.
&gt;
&gt; But in the end, I don't have the money to build one or buy one.

that was my problem, batteries cost more than an awfull lot of gas.
