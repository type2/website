Yes, that is true, but that cooling-by-expansion has nothing to do with
combustion.  The fuel also helps to cool the motor by evaporation.
Combustion contributesd heat, but I still say that most is caused by
friction.  Under load, perhaps higher combustion temps can add a lot of
heat, but under normal driving loads most heat is caused by friction.

The cooling caused by coasting with your foot off the gas is caused by the
cooling effects described by Cetin, not by the lack of
combustion(remember, when going down hill the spark is still firing, yet
the engine cools down!).
