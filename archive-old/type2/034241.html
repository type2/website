Subject: External oil cooler FS

Have RVEECO external cooler, that I've removed from our 74 Westfakia. Don't
really think suitcase..and maybe no engine needs them, unless you're
building a sandrail :). If interested, you might want to read pros/cons in
archives.

Apparently had a pin hole leak in one of the two common copper plumbing
lines on the underside, for over a year now..thought it was a rear seal
going..the tubing suddenly split..big time. Decided to remove the ugly thing
(it was mounted on the outside of the bus, near the left rear
vent)..expecting a big deal. Took all of 7 minutes :). Easy on..after you
fix the ordinary copper line.

My experience (we have 7 vehicles) is that on runs to about 20 miles, never
got above about 180 degrees (VDO guage mounted on bump plate). On long
highway runs, normally ran 210-225 in the mountains..only 3-5 cooler on the
flats. Again, not sure if properly tuned Vdubb needs one..but if you P-mail
me we can talk. I think it's worth $100 plus shipping..if you want it and
think that's too high..lemme know..I have NO idea what a new one costs. This
is complete and ready to install (hopefully UNDER your bus :), after copper
tubing fix.

Marv Krupp..finally in central Fla.

PS Rube Goldberg towing rig pulled KG 600 miles in one day..no overheat on
the 52 HP SC :) :) :)
