BTDT.  I did the same thing with an original Continental
tire.  It looked cool, with the little tits from the mold
still there and shiny silver paint on the rim.  It wasn't
cool when it went flat a half hour after mounting it.
              Don't use old tires.


The green Bentley manual has tire size recommendations
for your '72 bus.  Also, check the type2_dot_com library.
