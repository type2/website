&gt; I got these type IIs for sale off a site called:

&gt; 1980 Volkswagen Westfalia 1980 Volkswagon Vanagon Camper. Pop-top,
&gt; stove, fridge, sink.
&gt; Rebuilt engine, many new parts, spotless interior, superb running
&gt; condition. Relocating, must sell.
&gt; Only $2900. Call 203-266-5652. Darrow Kirkpatrick, CT, Phone:

These ads are pretty stale.  Not sure of the others, but this is the 
Westy that I dropped everything for (a couple of months back) and 
&quot;bought&quot;.  Or so I thought.

Anyway, the Westy and Darrow are no longer at that address/phone.

Happy Hunting!  :-)
