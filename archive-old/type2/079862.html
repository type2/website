Subject: RE: sump plate bolts stripped?

&gt;My sump plate, put on by whoever took it off last before i 
&gt;bought it, was put back on without the sealing washers... 
&gt;the result was that both bolts (little 10mm head m6 bolts 
&gt;i think) came off with aluminum in the threads... so the 
&gt;whole actual point of this message is to get reccomendations 
&gt;as to fixes - should i go with inserts (if so, where can 
&gt;i find ones that small) or should i put some studs in and 
&gt;fasten the plate on with nuts?

Your fix may be as easy as using slightly longer bolts.  I have fixed two 
motors with this ailment using that method.  Just go to the hardware store and 
find a couple of m6 bolts that are about 1/8-3/16 inch longer than the old 
ones.  Go gentle when you run them in the first time to make sure they aren't 
going to bottom out.
