Subject: FWD: When the goin gets hot, the Hot get air conditioning!

Guys,
Is there any reason why you couldn't install one of those externally roof top 
mounted air conditioners (like a caravan one), and have a 110/240v inverter 
running it?

No flames, please... it just seems like a good idea!

Also, if this is not physically or electrically possible, what would be the 
solution?

Cheers!

Hello all...
  Summer is upon us and it's getting hot. Does anyone have any suggestions for 
air conditioning in my 68 Bus? Are there any after-market products that 
utilize
