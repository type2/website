Subject: Drapes and Pop top tent

Well, the time has come to purchase both drapes and a pop top tent.  How
does the stuff at Bus Depot compare to the stuff Dawn at PLFVW makes?  And
feedback from people who have purchased these from either vender would be
appreciated.  So far I have had my bus for two months and it is still not
road worthy : (
