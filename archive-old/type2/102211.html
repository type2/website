Subject: Re: [T2] Soft Brakes?

George,

Amen on $100 bills.

I stopped at the local VW/BMW dealer before christmas to pick up
some &quot;old&quot; vw parts that actually fit my 78 and listen to the service 
manager explaining to an &quot;older&quot;(retired) couple why it cost
$175  to get their oil changed....you know..6 qts of synthetic, a 
filter...and 30 minutes of BMW mechanic time.

I was so embarrassed for all of them that I left as soon as I had my parts.

It reminded me of a guy that bought a Porsche 911 turbo more than a few 
years ago....the &quot;make ready&quot; charges were almost $6,000....I guess the
more you pay, the more you *will* pay for oil changes.

Makes me like my bus all the more!!!

Cheers, dave

&gt; actually economical to do it this way.  These days it seems to cost a
&gt; C-note to take a modern car into the service bay and several more C-notes
&gt; to remove it regardless of the work done!
