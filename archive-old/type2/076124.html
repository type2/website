Subject: Re: [T2] tires

i think it sort of depends on what type of terrain you drive on with
your vehicle.  i hardly ever take my bus off road, so getting
all-terrain type tires was not an issue for me. but it sounds like from
your post that those are the type of tires you want. not sure though.

FWIW, i have had good experiences with the Bridgestone 603V (D) &amp; the 
Yokohama Y356 (C). again, this was 95% highway driving.

for prices, i havent found anywhere that can beat tirerack_dot_com

good luck &amp; HTH.
