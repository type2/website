Subject: Drive your VW...

Greetings List -

I'm in digest mode, so forgive me if someone mentioned this already today.

Tomorrow, June 21st, is the 5th Annual VW Trends &quot;Drive Your VW to Work&quot; 
day.

It's my day-off, but I'll be running errands in the (OBC) bus, as usual.

Enjoy!

Mike &amp; Itch
