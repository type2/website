Subject: Re: [T2] 1978 Shift Rod R&amp;Rquestion

Chris,

Uh oh....yep tranny and engine *must* be out....but! read on...

I have installed the front bushing on the pin in front of the shifter
without taking it out....but, to do the three inside the housing, 
everything comes out....that's why you do it when you have engine and 
trans out already....really sorry bout that...

On a brighter note....when I did mine, they did not improve my shifting
at all....last time I had everything out(for the engine change), I took 
the nose cone off to replace the hockey stick bushings....no such luck as 
they were !roller bearing! bushings and were in great shape...the problem
on the 78 was the &quot;captive ball&quot; bushing that the end of the hockey stick 
goes in to....it as loose in the piece of metal that holds it....and I'm 
betting that I can only get one from someone like rancho or someplace.

part #63 here
http://www.bug-bits.freeserve.co_dot_uk/ramva/fiche/t202900.gif


So it will wait till it comes out again sometime.  I &quot;am&quot; going to replace 
the metal guide under the shifter this weeekend with a new one and see if 
it helps.  My pattern is good and tight, it's just that you can't move the 
stick all the way to the left or right and find the gears...

And yes...there are *three* bushings inside the tube on a 78...and *none* 
of the replacement bushings fit right without modification to the tube....


Cheers, dave
