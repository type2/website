&gt;which is better to use?

&gt;i am fixing to rebuild my engine and if i buy new heads i am out another 
&gt;800 bucks... if i rebuild the heads i already have; then will they hold up ...?

If they meet original specifications, they will function fine. Perhaps 1 in 
100+ machinists have the equipment AND skills AND experience to do it 
properly.


&gt;i guess maybe it depends on how much damage is done to the head itself to 
&gt;determine its future for the machine shop??

A competent machinist can tell you if your cores are or are not rebuildable.
