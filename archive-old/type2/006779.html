Subject: cleaning seat belts
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi listees,

Anyone had any luck cleaning the rear seat belts in a bay?  I have the 
originals and they do work, but are VERY hard to adjust.  I give many kids 
rides home from school and they aren't always the same ones in the same 
seats.  I would rather keep the belts that I have if I can make them safe and 
easier to adjust.  

As always thanks for the assistance,
Rob
