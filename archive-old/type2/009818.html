&gt;Paul,
&gt;
&gt;Might want to consider the Loctite 574, supposed to be a bit thicker (but
&gt;not at all thick) and offer a more reasonable crush, sort of simulating the
&gt;effect you are going for.  Also from most Porsche racers around me seems to
&gt;be about the best stuff hands down.  I too was going to put together my T4
&gt;this weekend, but decided to wait for the Loctite instead of the Aviation
&gt;Permatex.  Doesn't answer the question but is a thought.
&gt;
&gt;John

Thanks John,
    Since it looks like I won't be getting that crankcase assembled this 
weekend, I think I'll look into that Loctite 574.  Thanks for your reply.  
This type2 list, and all the folks that make it up are great, don't you 
think.

Paul
