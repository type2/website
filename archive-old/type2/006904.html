&gt; So, like, what does it mean when the oxygen sensor light comes on?  I
&gt; know what it means, says right in the manual to take it to my dealer,

&gt; gotta wing it on my own, unassisted-like.

It means that 30,000 miles have passed since the oxygen sensor light was
last reset.

If you want to, you can test your o2 sensor with a multimeter and if it
tests OK, keep driving!!!!

If you fastidious, go buy a new o2 sensor, (not at a dealer unless you're
independently wealthy), put it in, and reset the light.  To reset the
light, get under the front of the bus and follow the speedo cable from
the wheel up to the black box to which wires are attached (and from which
the speedo cable goes up to the speedometer itself) and find the button
which you push to get the reset.
