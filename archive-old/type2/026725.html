Jim Said :-

Has anyone out there ever lowered the suspension on a bus??  I'm not talking
about slamming it on the ground, but more like a 2 inch drop, especially for
the front end.  I do a lot of mountain (OK, really a big hill) driving, with
lots of windy twists.  Lowering the center of gravity would make it handle
better.  I know the best way to lower almost any suspension is to either get
lowered springs or dropped spindles, but nobody makes dropped spindles for a
late bus.  Twisting the torsion leaves would work, but would make the ride a
little harsh.  Anybody have any suggestions??


I Say :-

Lowering a Bus is far from uncommon, half the Bus owners I know have done
something different too them, lowering is one of the easy ones.  First up
admit why you really want it, it looks cool right ;) If it's just for the
handling I wouldn't bother, my bus is lifted with adjustable Koni's and
bigger sway bars all round and it handles better than standard, the shocks
make more of a difference than the height.

Anyway, I'm in Australia and these guys are the best
http://www.kruizinwagon_dot_com.au they can sell you a whole kit to lower a Bus,
lift it, stick a V8 or V6 in it like my Bus.  They can go from any height to
slammed right down if you like... anyway check them out.
