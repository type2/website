Subject: Re: [T2] Dizzy from the Funk!

&gt; Thanks for this link!  I went and checked it
&gt; out last night.  It turns out
&gt; that their listing does NOT have the two dizzy
&gt; as compatible. 

I'm gone for the next two days and I'll have to
look up the specs later.  You say not compatible
but I think you mean not interchangeable.  I
would still think the bug dizzy is preferable to
the 009.  Any dual advance (meaning vacuum and
centrifugal) is always better IMHO than any
centrifugal 009 or 050 (or any straight vacuum
dizzy for that matter).  

Put the bug dizzy on and time it like it's the
bug.  In other words use the dizzies specs not
the engine.  

Or purchase a rebuilt dual advance dizzy for your
bus from Bus Depot or Aircooled_dot_net.
