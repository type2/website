&gt;&gt; They're not listed in Bentley. It's 5.5mm to be exact.

&gt; The line from the tank to the fuel pump is larger than the line from the fuel
&gt; pump to the carbs.  Which of them is 5.5mm?  I suspect fp-&gt;carbs.  Maybe the
&gt; other one is 7.5mm?

On my 2 litre with mechanical pump, they are both 5.5mm.
