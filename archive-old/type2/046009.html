Hay Chad!

     it sounds like your lifter has bleed down, this just happened to my
79' bus. I went to my local Carquest parts store and bought a can of BG
MOA Part no. 110, just pour this in with your oil, then start your motor
and let it idle until your motor sounds normal. Mine took less then five
minute's. If your bus sits for awhile the oil in the lifters runs
out(bleed down), so when you go to start it, it will sound bad, so when
you run your bus the lifters will pump up(bleed up). I hope this will
help!
