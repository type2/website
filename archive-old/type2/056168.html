Hey there Guys and Gals,

Just wanted to thank everyone who responded to my query. 

  I ended up gettin a standard black coil from the local O'Reilly's to get me
going.  Now, next time I get back to OKC I'll hafta charge the battery and
hope the coil fixed the problem.  I hooked up the ohm meter to my old coil and
it wasn't up to specs (my Bentley's in OKC so I'm goin by the Haynes )  I
think for spares I'll take the advice yall gave and pick up a few at the
graveyard. 
 
If anyone has their Bentley handy are they showing?:
   Primary resistance:          2.6  to  3.1  ohms
   Secondary resistance:        6  to  12 K ohms

If not then what?
BTW, this is the Conventional Ignition w/ points

Thanks man,

Don (SkyCruizer)
