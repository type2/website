Hello,

After converting and rebuilding my 2nd VW bus in the
past 4 years, my third and current project has got to go
to make room for the 4wd drive bug that has bitten me.

Here is what I have:

1968 Deluxe walkthru.  Red interior.  All panels are in
good shape.  All seats are there.  The spare tire cover
is there.  The driver seat needs recovered.

No engine.

Currently a repainted shell in storage.  All the glass and
interior is out.  The only rust was under the front turn
signals.  It has been patched.  The only other bad parts
were the wing windows in the slider and cargo area.  The
metal is deteriorated.  I was going to replace the windows
with flat glass.

The Bus was originally from So. Cal.  My Uncle bought it new
and he gave it to me a few years ago.

It is repainted a non stock color.  It is Burgundy on top
and Grey on the bottom.  The paint has never seen sun or
rain.

I have all the chrome and body bits including the front emblem.

2 transmissions.
1 Front beam.

All the parts to convert it over to the new style brakes, including
front disk beam, rear drums and calipers, brake booster, rims and
tires.

Strait dash cover and gauges.

Overhead air unit that needs to be installed.  No
compressor or condenser.

Hundreds of dollars of parts from The Bus Depot go with it.

Including:
Shocks.
CV boots.
Headliner.
ALL door and window seals.
Carpet.
etc.
These parts are new in the box and have never been used.

Everything but the engine is there.  All it needs is finished
with a loving hand.

There is even a tow bar on the front bumper.  (Yeah, I know, but
my uncle is the one that screwed up the bumper.)

I would prefer to sell the whole thing to someone who will finish
the project.  If no one wants the whole thing, I might consider
selling the parts.

$1,000 takes it all today.

Joe
