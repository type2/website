Subject: Re: [T2] Need advice on 79 Westy - Cookeville bus for sale too &lt;grin!&gt;

--=====================_3669846==_.ALT

The Dell carbs are worth about $300 so you could part this puppy out if you 
had to.

&gt;Looked at a 79 Westy today.  Guy wants $500 for it.  Engine is out and
&gt;disassembled with a burned out #3 piston and all that entails.
&gt;Converted from FI to dual Delorto's.  Canvas has some bits of dry rot
&gt;and needs replacing, as does most all the rubber.  Tranny sounds as if
&gt;it was strong up until the engine blew.  Like wise with front end.
&gt;Interior reflects some of the previous owners personalites.  Sheet metal
&gt;screws holding down peeling veneer from the cabinetry around the sink,
&gt;stove and fridge.  Original upholstery in pretty good shape.  Not much
&gt;rust to speak of other than some minor surface rust in the usual places.

Do you feel confident that you can do the work or pay somebody else to do 
it. If the van is complete but showing it's age and simply needs new 
rubber, paint, and veneer then I say okay! If the body needs paint and a 
few bumps and dents fixed then I say okay! If there is significant rust I 
would start scratching my head.

What's missing? Tables? Stove? Fridge? Trim?

What works? Electrical system? Steering tight?

Has it been hit?

Where's it rusting? Where has it been stored?

Count on a full rebuild on that engine. He may have run it lean with those 
carbs and burned the piston up.

Assume the worst on the parts of the bus that you can't test, that way you 
aren't disappointed.

Comparison: My wife and stopped to look at a '78 (?) Westy parked on the 
side of the road here in Cookeville. The interior is ratty, filthy, veneer 
peeling or broken. It had a DPD (?) a/c system complete. Needs paint and 
unknown amount of mechanical repairs. Dunno if it runs. There is little of 
the engine tin sealed b/c of the a/c compressor sticking through. I 
recognize this van to be a fellow's work van. When I saw it last it was 
1997 and this van was full of tools and junk. No wonder the interior looks 
so ratty.

Catch this: missing the interior spare tire door, rear bumper and sliding door!

Price? $3000. THREE THOUSAND BUCKS!

Are they kidding? The bus is worth $600 tops.

We laughed the whole way home....
