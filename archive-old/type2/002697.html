Holy schmokes, being an editor must pay better than I thought.  Here's my
experience:  I've got a 71 Westy that I only paid $800 for, runs great,
53,000 miles, terrific interior.  But...a Michigan bus all it's life.
Rotten rockers, holes the size of my fist in the rear corners.  I'm working
on it, it'll be fine some day.  But much as I love that vehicle, if I had to
do it again, I'd buy a one way ticket to Arizona, buy a bus there and
adventure drive it home.  You could get a magnificent bus for $10,000 out
there, maybe not a '62 deluxe, but you'd have your pick, and never mess with
anything like the rust yours has.  I wish you luck (yep, learn to weld, take
a course), but think it through before you put that kind of money into it.

Again, good luck and have fun on the way.  Tell us how it goes.

&gt;Rough estimate, just based on a cursory look at the van: $10,000-12,000.
&gt;
&gt;While it doesn't seem outrageous, it will take some explaining to my wife.
