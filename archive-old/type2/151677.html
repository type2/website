Subject: RE: [T2] VPC Air Conditioner for Station Wagon

Corbett,

Great pics on their site!  Gives everyone with a t1 engine a good idea of 
where it goes....however....

Looks like not enough &quot;belt wrap&quot; on everything to me.
I prefer adding a belt and pulley to the original setup.

And, there is no reason that they could not have tilted the mount on the 
Sanden's a little and used some different hose mounts so that you didn't 
have to change the air outlet on the 3/4 side.  Haven't seen one in a long 
time tho, so I could be really wrong about that.

Looks to me like the compressor on the bus pic is beefier than the KG one.

Cheers, dave

 I have not followed this entire thread, but from reading that past few emails
 it looks like a fair amount of work. Have you contacted anyone about another
 kit? Check out http://www.gilmore-enterprises_dot_com/ Their site is not great,
&gt; but it does have a few pics. Email them, they can tell you more about their
&gt; setups. They just finished one for the Type 4 engine. Entire kit including the
&gt; underdash blower for $1300. Expensive, but they do sell it in pieces, so you
&gt; might be able to get a kit to mount the compressor.
