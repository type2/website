Subject: Re: [T2] worn hydraulic lifters

&gt; argh.. are you serious?  eeeeek!  What would cause it to stop rotating?

 Just for the sake of curiousity, can I resurface the lifters and put
them back in?  I could mill them smooth again..

Sorry, the cam lobe will be shot. Look at a good one thru the lifter hole as you slowly turn the engine. Look
at the sharp point on the toe of the lobe. Now look at the lobe that wiped out that lifter. The point will be
gone.
The lifter you pictured is wasted. The wear pattern has gone past the hardness. Lifters are not flat. They are
ground convex. If you stand a good one on a piece of glass, only the center will touch. This is what allows
the lifter to rotate.
