Subject: Re: [T2] One version of why we are &quot;orphans&quot; of VW

Well, in marketing terms this is &quot;brand implosion.&quot; Consider the VW bus ads
of the Doyle Dane Bernbach era--they made no bones about the boxiness of the
vehicle but emphasised practicality and technical refinement. The VW brand
used to stand for practicality, simplicity, reliability and super-strong
form-follows-function design.

I think that VW's market segment included a lot of upwardly mobile,
well-educated professionals who appreciated the design factors. Today this
market segment still appreciates design, but more in the sense of style than
in the sense of function. Hence the VW brand is about style and luxury and
not about cargo space.

Unfortunately there is a big gap in simple, practical, affordable and
user-hackable automotive tech. At the moment the Honda Element looks to me
most like the VW bus of the 1960-1970s. Some of Honda's concept cars include
mesh seats, laminate flooring and integral pet carriers. And it wouldn't be
much of a stretch to envision a Dormobile camper conversion on an Element
platform.

It's really a shame that VW hasn't continued in this spirit. Imagine a sport
vehicle that could be cleaned out with a garden hose, lightweight, camp-able
and powered with a TDI V-6 that could run on biofuel, built-in power
inverter, integrated solar panel trickle charger. Doesn't seem like it would
be that big a stretch...

&gt; have to admit that I wouldn't buy stock in VW today. They have drifted for
&gt; a
&gt; very long time. They need another success in the direction of the New
&gt; Beetle, but are late to realize this.
