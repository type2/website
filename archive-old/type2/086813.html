&gt; Thanks for the help everyone...considering my need to get the generator 
&gt; out...I decided to just cut the Belt....and i will take the Generator down to 
&gt; a shop and use a torque wrench of somekind...however...I am missing something 
&gt; with respect to removing the Generator....I have removed the four corner 
&gt; lugs, removed the strap that holds the Generator to the Stand...it slides 
&gt; back towards me(the rear of the vehicle) but it doesn't want to come 
&gt; out....What am I missing....Thanks to everyone who has responded....
