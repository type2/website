Subject: Fuel Pump Harness 

Okay I have a '77 Westy Deluxe AutoTrans., was formerly Weberized and all FI 
removed by PO. I have since pulled the engine and resealed everything and 
replaced the missing flaps in the cooling tin, etc. I also picked up a 
complete FI setup for a '78. I have been searching for the reason why my 
Fuel pump will not work. It runs out of the bus. I have been looking for a 
fuse that is in the fuel pump harness under the fuel tank. I have the 
harness there it was original to the bus or should I say it was not removed. 
Supposedly from what I have been told by everyone I asked there is supposed 
to be a fuse holder 1 wire on 1side and 2 on the other. I can't find it. Not 
in the engine compartment not behind the cooling tin. Anybody have any 
ideas?

Access Bob are you out there? Do you have this harness and fuse holder on 
your bus?

Thanks,

Michael Knight
'77 Westy Deluxe, &quot;el Verde&quot;
