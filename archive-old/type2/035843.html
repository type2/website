Subject: Re: rough idle and low RPMs OK at RPM

Thanks, turns out that the idle was set too low and I think that the
main problem was that the fat tube coming from the oil breather was old
and coming apart. I replaced/shortend all the hosing I thought might
be causing problems and no more dying at stop lights but I still can't
ge the idle up to 950. I think I'll try your suggestion next. 
Thanks again - CLW

&gt; &lt;snip&gt; My 79 FI bus (automatic, 2.0L) is idling roughly at low RPMs
&gt; and almost dying at idle. Any one have any idea what the common cause
&gt; of this sort of problem are? &lt;/snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Hey there volks,
&gt; 
&gt; My 78 bus was an auto too. I found that the idle was set way to low
&gt; for an automatic. I think the spec is 950 rpm, but I could be wrong
&gt; (the bentley,muir and haynes are in the bus). Someone might have set
&gt; the idle to the specs for a 4spd bus, which is lower. 
&gt; 
&gt; The other thing to look out for is vacumme leaks. I couldn't get my
&gt; 78 to idle higher, by adjusting the idle screw. Drove me nuts, as i
&gt; thought is might be the aux. air value, etc, etc. Ended up being the
&gt; connection to the brake booster line. Fixed that and it idled like
&gt; a
&gt; champ, and didn't stall at stoplights anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps,
&gt;
