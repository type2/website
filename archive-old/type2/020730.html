Subject: converting 78 heater boxes to 72

Hello,
I am i the process of getting all the parts together to replace the
exhuast and heater boxes on my 78 Westy.
I am going to put on heater boxes from a 72-74. I have the boxes and the
exhaust new from the Bus Depot.
I went with VW boxes and the stainless muffler. I am wondering what else
I will need to complete the conversion.
I am also looking for some personel experience tips on how to do this.
Once again list thanks.

Regards,
Bill M
Mystic,CT
78 Westy
