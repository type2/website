Subject: Re: [T2] Big clutch nightmare...resolved for now.

I take that back. He is NOT giving me a free clutch. He is trading me the
210 which he claims is 50-75 more expensive for the 228 returned.

So He is going to save me $50-75, but I have to remove and reinstall the
engine. I am not too happy anymore.

&gt; Ok the guy at GoWesty confirmed that I would have to switch out the
&gt; bellhousing to make my 228mm flywheel fit. He admitted he made a mistake
and
&gt; was apologetic and said he would do what it takes to make me happy (come
and
&gt; reinstall my engine :)  )
&gt;
&gt; Anyway he is sending me a free 210mm clutch, cover and assorted to replace
&gt; the 228 for free. I will send him back my 228 and flywheel for a full
credit
&gt; and he will pay the shipping both ways.
&gt;
&gt; In the end I will have to machine my flywheel (expected in an engine swap
I
&gt; guess), and remove and install the engine a second time.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the knowledge on this list. When I called him he stated at
first
&gt; that the 228 would work just fine, but I told him everyone on the list
said
&gt; it wouldn't fit. He then talked to someone else after I said that and
&gt; realized he made a mistake. This list does carry a lot of weight. He was
&gt; very nice and apologetic. I have a hard time faulting him for it, but I
sure
&gt; do miss driving my bus as its my daily driver. I would like a cigar, but I
&gt; can't get to the store!!!
