&gt;from Melissa Holbrook Pierson [The Perfect Vehicle]: &quot;Riding on a motorcycle 
can make you feel joyous, powerful, peaceful, frightened, vulnerable, and 
back out to happy again, perhaps in the same ten miles. It is life 
compressed, its own answer to the question, &quot;Why?&quot;

When you arise in the morning, give thanks for the food and the joy of 
living.  If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in 
yourself.  Abuse no one and nothing, for abuse turns the wise ones into fools 
and robs the spirit of it's vision.
(Tecumseh)
