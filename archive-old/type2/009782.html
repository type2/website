Subject: '78 Riviera Camper for sale in Seattle
Message-ID: &lt;19990610200713.25327.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

I have decided to sell my bus. Here is all the details.

2.0 litre engine 93,000 miles. Runs great! It really does.

Fuel injection, works great never had any problems, I have alot of spare 
parts including injectors and an extra control unit, although I never needed 
any of this stuff

Hydraulic lifters, a little noisy, no big deal

Pop-top camper interior in great shape. Includes two beds (bottom bed can 
fold out half at a time, kind of nice) sink and closet, propane tank 
underneath. Dash, upholstery and every thing is in great shape.

Body is in pretty good shape. It is brown and I think it is the Champagne 
Edition (stripes all the way around it) A little rust in not bad places, 
nothing big. It is a camper though, not a show bus.

I live in Seattle Washington, in White Center if you know Seattle.
Come buy and Check it out.
I'm at (206) 431-9023 or if you are close 10746 27th s.w. Seattle

I can send pictures if you want, just call or e-mail me.

I'm asking $2500. I would also consider a deal for a cheap bug and cash.

Thanks,
        Simon King
