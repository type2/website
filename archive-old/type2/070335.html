Hi Paul,

Actually the &quot;newer&quot; style roof that you are referring to began 
being offered in the 1974 model year (at least in N. America)

The newer style pop top that opens towards the front would 
technically fit on your 71' but to get the upstairs bed 
functioning properly would require major surgery. It would be 
necessary to cut the top of the roof off and install the 
subcompartment in order for the upstairs bed to lay flat. 
Otherwise you would be slleping on a bed that followed the 
contour of the roof :)

Bottom line is that it is technically feasible but it would be a 
buncha work, it would prolly be easier to buy a &gt;74' bus than try 
and retrofit your 71'

m.


&gt; 
&gt; question...is there a difference in roof integrity between the 
body 
&gt; styles of 68-71 and 72-(end of breadloaf)?  the reason i ask is 
&gt; because i'm interested in putting a later model roof on my '71 
so 
&gt; i'll have the bigger bed up top.  
&gt; 
&gt; thanx
