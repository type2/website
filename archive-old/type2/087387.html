Subject: Petronix and dwell

I am running a Petronix in the stock DVAD on my '71 Westy.

I had a bit of a rough ride home all of a sudden yesterday and today 
I stuck every gauge I own on the beast.  The only one that gave a 
surprise reading was the dwell meter. Instead of reading 47 degrees, 
it read 70.

Is it legitimate to expect a conventional dwell meter to read dwell 
on a Petronix ignition system?

I see no way to adjust the dwell.

Any advice?

Jack
