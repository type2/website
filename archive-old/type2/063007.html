&gt;Called a company down in Memphis that advertises in Hemming's: Redi Strip

&gt;removes all of the paint and rust from the car. It takes at least 32 hours

&gt;Thought you all would be interested. I figure this would be worthwhile for a
&gt;very rare bus, but for $1000 I can buy the mig welder I want, a nicer
&gt;sandblasting kit, and a whole bunch of wire and sand. 8) Joe

figure $300 for the welder, and $300 for a decent blaster, $200-$500 for a
decent _used_ compressor, $15/100# of copper slag blasting media, $30 for a
10# spool of innershield wire...

I was tempted to go the dip-route on the '54, but I was afraid there
wouldn't be much bus left when they were done.  Also, I wasn't sure how the
undercoating would work:  would I have to strip it all off first? :(
