I recall that these &quot;towing eyes&quot; are actually tie-down loops for tying the bus down to the ship during transport via ocean vessel. This may have been covered already; I've been missing bunches of e-mails, it seems.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;My '71 has a towing eye on the right hand bumper guard, but I wouldn't
&gt;trust it for anything but light-duty use.
&gt;
&gt;For heavy towing, I would tie to the lower right hand tube of the
&gt;front beam, as close as the frame attachement as possible
