Subject: spark plug #4

I did a compression test and it turned out fine. Right in line with the
others so I'm pretty sure the cylinder is ok. Ran out of time to work on
it. I'm going to put new plug wires on it tomorrow. The ones I have are
old and they are a relatively cheap thing to replace. So we'll see
tomorrow. It better work though cuz I'm getting ready for Everybus.
