&gt; I am a newbie to the World of Fuel Injection That Said :

just hang in there. Once running correctly a FI system is fantastic.
You just have to suffer through all the POs who neglected the system.

&gt; Slowly became more frequent. Did a minor tune up - points, plugs condensor-
&gt; checked everything else. No other problems then pitted points and some
&gt; carbon on the plugs. Same problem. Ignition seemed good so started with fuel
&gt; injection. Changed the Cyl head temp sensor, no better in fact becoming
&gt; worse. 

Just to cover a base or two, what did you set your timing to? What
about dwell? 

&gt; The bus now starts fine but stalls when ever not feeding fuel. Acceleration
&gt; feels very heavy-  Idles fine when first started and then after warm idles
&gt; up and down catches itself right before stalling.

This part sounds kinda like a fuel delivery problem, but a few months
ago I got a rebuild AFM for my bus. Turns out that the machine they
apparently calibrate it with was bumpkus. I had the same symptoms when
changing it out. I didn't run it long enough to tell if it was running
rich from the plugs, but the horrible and slugish effects were about
the same.

All the same, you really should test the FI system per the bentley. It
really only takes a FI pressure gauge in addition to your regular
tune-up tools. Try to verify if the system is getting enough pressure
and if not why not (clogged tank/filter/bad regulator). If you
eliminate this you really help eliminate a lot of the FI system as
being suspect. Bentley has a fantastic section on this.

&gt; After running for while it will stall and I have a tough time restarting -
&gt; if it sits it powers up fine. Strong odor of fuel. Carbon on all plugs.
&gt; Tested the injectors 2 bad and a leaking Cold start valve. Replaced but
&gt; still having the same problem - very mushy and up and down idle. No power
&gt; and very rich. 

If the fuel delivery checks out, then check the AFM. How does it
compare w/ specs. This is a pretty simple check w/ a VOM.

&gt; I have not tested the coil or gone any futher with the injection. I am
&gt; hoping to get some suggestions at what to check next. I am starting to look
&gt; at the Air Flow meter as the culprit.  Any thoughs, directions or advice
&gt; will be appreciated.

I kinda think your guess is correct w/ the AFM. But it's a pricy part
to just guess at. Good luck and report back with anything you find.
