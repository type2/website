With all of this disagreement, I would check the compression myself before
you do unnecessary work.  You can buy a compression tester for about $25.
No reason to pay someone else $$ to do something so simple for you.  Remove
all 4 plugs, insert tester, turn engine over for about 5 seconds, repeat
for each cylinder.  Just be careful that you don't strip the spark plug
holes in the heads.

&gt;This weekend will be devoted to pulling the motor and putting new heads on
&gt;(they wanted 600 dollars to do the job).  Is there anything unusual I
&gt;should look for when doing this?  And, are there any tips anyone can think
&gt;of that may save me work/time when pulling the motor?

You don't have to pull the motor to replace the heads, but it may be easier
to do so.  Maybe not if you don't have a garage.  Purists will tell you to
remove the engine regardless.  I've done it both ways and neither one is
particularly easy.  Don't turn the engine over with the heads off or the
liners will come out of the case.  This leads to the possibility that crud
will get in the gap and you don't want that to happen.  Best way is to wire
the cylinders against the case.  Avoid GEX heads.  Don't neglect to put the
thermostat pulley bolt back in because the hole goes right into the sump
and you will have a big oil leak.  That's all I can think of at the moment.
Good luck...
