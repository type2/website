Subject: Driving a bus

I have read the Muir section on driving a bus and was wondering how many
follow that advice to the letter? It seems kinda nutty to drive in 3rd gear
above 45mph...in my '71 the engine sounds like it is turning to fast in 3rd
gear at 45mph...or is that just because I am use to driving jap cars?

Thanks Volks,
Scott
