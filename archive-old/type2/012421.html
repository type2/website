X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

hey volks,
i certainly dont have the knowledge of many of the
people who post on a regular basis and help us keep
our busses running, but i sure wouldnt ever recommend,
especially to a newbie that going around 80 in their
bus should be commonplace.  while maybe not 100%
perfect the cooling system in my bus is all their and
in good condition and during hot summer months i
personally wouldnt think of even hitting 75 with it. 
on my cross country jaunts i tend to keep it right
around 65, she just seems happy at that speed.  its an
1800, so their is somewhat of a power difference
between it and a 2 litre, but i feel if i was heading
cross country for prolonged periods at 75-80, my AIRs
list would definitely be used.  just a novices $.02

&gt; &gt; Yup, I'd agree with this. Things get more marginal
&gt; in a genuinly hot
&gt; &gt;climate but the stock system is pretty sound if
&gt; it's properly maintained.
&gt; 
&gt; I still think the stock cooling system is
&gt; underengineered.  I have no doubt that my engine
&gt; would melt down in short order if I held it at 79mph
&gt; for any length of time.  This would require full
&gt; throttle and nearly 5000rpm in my bus.  I have a new
&gt; engine compartment seal, functioning thermostat, and
&gt; all seals in place.  It was also my understanding
&gt; that redline for a 2-liter bus motor is 4400rpm. 
&gt; I'm sure it's higher for the Porsche engines.  My
&gt; engine has never seen 5000rpm, much less 5200 or
&gt; 5400.  It does just fine at 65mph/3900rpm though.
