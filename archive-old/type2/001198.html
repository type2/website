Well, my long-awaited overseas shipment has arrived, and there are
definately some killer items here. This is by far my largest European order
ever, and probably for some time. So it's a long list.  If you're
interested, read on, and if not, delete.

You can order the parts via the website (which is secure for credit cards),
or of course you can call or e-mail. If you want to order them via the
website, they are all on the BARGAINS page.  If you go to the main search
page, which is http://www.busdepot_dot_com/ASP/search_new.asp , you will find a
link to the BARGAINS page on the left side of that page.  Please note that
the below pricing reflects LIST MEMBER DISCOUNTS THAT WILL EXPIRE THE END OF
THIS MONTH, OR SOONER IF THEY SELL OUT (which many will).  You MUST specify
that you are a list member, in the comments section of the website order
form (or over the phone), in order to get these prices.  The website will
list most of the prices as a bit higher, but as long as you specify your
membership, we will adjust the price manually prior to shipping.

BRAKE SHOES/PADS
As many of you know, new German brake shoes have been nearly impossible to
find in the U.S, and when you could find them the price was ridiculous.
The ones found in the U.S. are typically resurfaced, not new.  I now have a
quantity of NEW original-equipment Pagid brake shoes, directly from Germany,
at very reasonable prices.  These are comparable to what came on your VW, as
Pagid is an original supplier to VW/Germany. I have decent stock right now,
but future availability is up in the air, so it's worth stocking up.
'68-91 REAR SHOES are $29.95 a pair (different part #s for different yrs,
same price).
'68-70 FRONT SHOES are $29.95 a pair.
'71-85 FRONT PADS are $19.95 a pair (71-72 are European ATE, not Pagid)

RETRACTING SIDE DOOR STEPS
This is quite a rarity.  These are N.O.S. Volkswagen steps that
automatically retract when you close your sliding door, and slide out when
you slide the door open.  Hardware and mounting parts are included. This is
genuine Volkswagen product, and does not come with instructions since it was
intended to be dealer-installed. Never offered in the U.S. but was an option
in Europe and elsewhere.  You may have seen them in foreign VW brochures or
articles. I myself have never even heard of one being seen in the U.S.
$249.95.


BODY RUBBER

I have new Genuine VW windshield gaskets for '68-79 busses for $17.95.  The
kicker, besides their genuine VW pedigree, is they extend just slightly
lower onto the body than the original ones do, not enough to be really
noticable but enough to cover some of the minor rust repair that you may
have had to do at the windshield lip. If you've looked under your current
windshield gasket, you know what I mean. :-)

Another new item is European made engine door seals.  These are the correct
single-piece, four-corner seals, not the &quot;you-assemble-it&quot; version that WCM
etc. sell (which are 4 separate pieces that you glue together).  $19.95

I also have new side window seals for $19.95, for either the stationary
window (no vent wing) or the stationary part only of a side window that has
a vent wing.  These are European made and much nicer than the ones I've seen
stateside until now, at a better price to boot. They are &quot;cal look&quot; (no
groove for chrome molding).

I found Genuine VW rear hatch door seals for '68-79 busses, for $79.95, by
far the lowest price ever. (WCM gets about $120 for these.)

Also premium quality European made sliding door seals for $49.95, which is
cheaper than Brazilian ones usually go for.

Finally, front door vent wing seals.  The frame-to-body seals are $14.95 per
side, and the upright seals that go on the front door vent wing facing the
roll-down window are $1.99 each.


FOG LIGHTS
Still in the original Volkswagen boxes; lenses bear the Hella logo. Were
optional on '68-79 busses in Europe. Not sure if they were even offered in
the U.S.  Mount above or below the front bumper. About 6&quot;x 3&quot;.  Dash switch
not included (any toggle switch would do).  Only 10 pair.  $99.95/pr.


SHEET METAL

I got complete lower front door skins - the whole outside door skin,
starting just below the window, not just the lower panel.  These are
Brazilian by way of Europe, but are different from the Brazilian ones that
are currently being imported into the US in that they replace more of the
door.  Only $59.95 each.

I also have the sliding door rail covers (the metal cover that goes below
the rear side window), for either side, for $29.95. Replacement requires no
welding, so it's easy if yours is rusted. Replacement black
beading is also available inexpensively. I also have the V-channel section
that the cover slides onto for $9.95.

I have front cab area floor panels (area in front of passenger seat),
passenger side only, European made, for $24.95

I have the inside front wheel well section, for lack of a better name for
it.  This is the section behind the front tire, if you were looking toward
the rear of the bus from inside the front wheel well area. In other words,
this is the section that probably has a big hole in it if you live in an
area that uses road salt, causing salt and water to be splashed up into the
inside of your rocker panels from your front tires.  This is why most bus
rocker panels rust out from the inside out.  $18.95 per side.


I have left and right lower outer rocker panels for $12.95 each, and one
complete '73-79 front nose (from the lower windshield pillar area down) for
$139.95.

Finally, I have front and rear '73-79 bumpers, gray primered, for $79.95
each.


DUAL BATTERY KIT
This is a genuine Hella relay kit designed for adding a second (auxilliary
or camping) battery to a VW bus or camper.  Basically, it separates the two
batteries when the ignition is off (to prevent your starting battery from
draining if you run your aux battery down) and automatically connects them
when you start the bus so both can charge when you drive. Includes the
relay, wiring, and instructions.  $18.95.

FRONT SHIFT ROD
This is the long shift rod that goes front-to-rear under the bus, and
attaches to the shift plate under the gear stick. 74-79 bus, genuine VW,
previously unavailable, $34.95.

GAS TANKS
I have two N.O.S. German gas tanks, one '68-71 and one '72-74.  Both long
out of production.  $249 each. Because of the small quantity I'm not going
to put these on the website. Please call or email if interested (first come
first serve).


EXHAUST SYSTEMS

After being unable to obtain them for almost two years, I once again have
100% German made exhaust systems for 1500-1600cc busses (thru '71).  I had
been forced to piece together German and Danish parts until now, but these
are all German, and cheaper as well.  Includes everything behind the heat
exchangers; muffler, damper pipe, tailpipe, brackets, clamps, etc. $99.95
complete.  Add a pair of the N.O.S. heat exchangers (below) for a complete
German setup

I also got some German made STAINLESS STEEL mufflers for '72-74 busses.
Packaged with a tailpipe (not stainless) and hardware, the whole kit will
run you $189.95.  These are the stock setup for '72-74, but also are direct
bolt-on replacements for '79-83 (albeit without a cat or egr hookup). They
will even fit '75-78, but only if you put on '72-74 heat exchangers (one
side of which I have on sale, below).  This is an absolute bargain and if
your bus is in this year range you should grab a spare.  These stainless
steel mufflers have not been offered in the U.S. before, much less at this
price.  If you need the muffler only, it will run you $169.95.  (Note: the
&quot;dent&quot; on one side of the muffler is intentional, and
is stock.)


HEAT EXCHANGERS &amp; RELATED

I got my last shot of genuine N.O.S. German VW heat exchangers, just in time
for winter.  As far as I know, when these are gone there are no more, so you
may want to put a pair away for safe keeping.  Those who got these from me
before will attest that there is nothing like them available today; the
current aftermarket ones are much thinner.
'68-71 $189.95/pair  Right side only $99.95, left side not sold separately
due to diminishing supply.
'72-74 right side only, $149.95
Vanagon $349.95/pair (only 2 pr left)

I also got some more of the ACCORDIAN TUBES that go forward from the heat
exchangers on '68-79 busses.  I got them in before and sold out of them
almost immediately. Now I have more. $19.95 each


CV JOINT/BOOT KITS
I got a very good deal on genuine Lobro (original-equipment VW) kits. These
include everything: joint, boot, grease, and hardware.  You need 4 kits per
bus if you're replacing all of them. Fit '68-79.  Price is $49.95 per kit,
which is about what the joint alone normally goes for.  I also have the boot
kit only (boot, grease, hardware) for $9.95 each, also genuine Lobro.

CARBURETORS
I got a few more N.O.S. German '72-74 bus carbs. These are the original ones
that came on your bus, and last sold for $1100 each (!!!) before VW deleted
them.  You could also use them on any pancake engine as a great carb
conversion, but would need the ancilliary parts (external linkage, etc.)
from a '72-74 parts donor if your bus currently does not have the original
dual carb setup, since these are just the carbs themselves.  Price is
$369.95 for the pair; no more available when these are gone.

TAIL LENSES
I have replacement tail lenses for '63-71 for $4.95 each, and for '72-79 for
$9.95 each.

BRAKE BACKING PLATES
I got some more rear brake backing plates for '73-79 busses for $99.95/pair,
genuine VW.

BRAKE PEDAL RETURN SPRINGS
These have also been long unavailable.  If your pedal return is mushy, a new
spring (genuine VW) is $1.99.

WINDOW REGULATORS
I got some more drivers side window regulators (the part that raises and
lowers the drivers door window), genuine European VW, for $29.95. Normally
the flimsier Mexican knockoffs cost $10 more.

LICENSE PLATE LIGHT
These include the lense, bulb assembly, and bulb, genuine VW, for 1971-79
busses. Unavailable for some time. $15.95.

HAND BRAKE KNOB
Genuine VW, replace your cracked one for $6.95.

GENERATOR
Stock generator, 68-71 bus, German rebuilt, NO core deposit, $99.95 (about
half price). 6 only.

ACCELERATOR PEDALS &amp; PARTS
They're finally back again, genuine VW.  The pedal is $11.95, the hinge and
pin $6.49 for both.

IGNITION COILS
Original VW/Germany (Bosch) black ignition coils, stock on '79-83 California
only (and '84 all). Orig dealer cost $60. $24.95.

PETER RUSSEK POCKET MECHANIC MANUALS
These user-friendly repair manuals from the U.K. are reasonably priced,
relatively complete, and sized to fit in your glovebox.  $12.95 each.

VANAGON STUFF
Since some members of the Type 2 list have Vanagons, I'll mention some of
the other items that I'm posting to the Vanagon list. You can go to the
bargains page on the website to see the list. I will also post a full
description to the vanagon list, but seeing how long this post is I thought
I'd leave them out of here.  The parts include:
complete factory tachometers/speedo clusters, eurpopean taillight
assemblies, bumper impact strips, plastic hubcaps, body rubber, mud flaps,
trailer hitches, lenses and, and more.

FREE JUST KAMPERS CATALOGS
As some of you know, I have been combining buying power with Just Kampers in
the U.K. in order to bring you better pricing on certain bus parts. They
print a nice glossy catalog in England, which I now have some copies of.
Some of the items I sell much cheaper anyway, but others are not currently
available in the U.S.  I can get you anything in the catalog, although some
of them may take a few months depending on availability.  Pricing will vary,
as catalog pricing is in Pounds Sterling (multiply by 1.66 to get a rough
idea, although as I said I do already sell many items cheaper anyway).
While they last, a copy if free for the asking with a $50 order (you must
ask in the comments section of the order form if ordering via the website).
Sorry, but I can't send one without an order, since I just don't have the
extra manpower to afford to take them away from filling orders and ask them
to address and mail dozens of catalogs.

Well, that's it.  Whew!!  Sorry it was such a long post, but hopefully it
was worth the reading.
