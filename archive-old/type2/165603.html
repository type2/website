&gt;  This has a master

The two outside switches are pressure switches.  The middle switch is a
mechanical switch that responds to movement of a separate piston in the
MC.  It works unless the separate piston is gunked up, which it probably
is!  VW switched to the 2-three terminal switch MCs because they are
simpler and more reliable.

Maladjusted brakes should not cause the brake warning light to illuminate
unless they are way out of adjustment.
