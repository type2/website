&gt; contact me personally if you have anything.


I have been looking and cannot find anything difinitive as to weather or
not the 003 pump shaft is the same as the 010 shaft.  I have a 010 shaft
but don't want to waste it by sending it if it won't work, on the other
hand if it will work I am more than willing to send it on.  do you maybe
have a 010 shaft you can check with ??

let me know

Bob
