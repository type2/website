Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon hydraulic clutch questions &amp; engine install

I can't speak to a lot of your issues, but sometimes the splines won't
mate because you need to turn the crankshaft slightly to get it to
line up. Transmission in neutral can help too.

 Been working on installing my engine for the last few hours and getting

 This is a 1980 Vanagon. Had the engine in place and could tell the trans.
 input shaft had entered the clutch disk but didn't seat into the pilot
 bearing. Wiggled and jiggled and pushed things around but it just wouldn't go
 together. lowered the engine to survey the situation. The disk is centered and
 all looks wall except the throwout bearing was in the depressed position as if
 someone was pressing the clutch pedal down.
