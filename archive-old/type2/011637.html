Hey there Niall,

You might also want to consider a $99 rebuilt dizzy from John at
aircooled_dot_net . Everyone else I checked with only had the 205s dizzy
brand new. I bought a rebuilt (205s) for my 79, and I am very please
with the results. I still might rebuild the old one as a spare, but I
haven't gotten around to it.

No fuss, no muss, just pull out the old and bolt in the new.

Just another option/opinion,
