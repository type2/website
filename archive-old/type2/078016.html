Subject: RE: [T2] How to take out the plastic bolt from heater control nob???

[...]
On my 71 I'm just able to slide the levers through the slots after
removing the red and blue soft plastic tips.  I spread the levers so
they aren't aligned.  I've never removed the plastic rivets.  Maybe a
previous owner did some trimming on the lever tips but I don't think
so. I was able to remove the instrument cluster from a 73 bus this
was also.

&gt;Hello All,
&gt;
&gt;I've tried to take out that 4 pieces of plastic under the dash that 
&gt;hold the
&gt;heater control nob in order to remove speedo for repair on 71 Westy. 
&gt;What's
&gt;the best way to do this? It's pretty hard to use hand to squeez 
&gt;them, and if
&gt;I use something else, I might break them. Is there some way to do 
&gt;this
&gt;better way? Also, it doen not have enough room for my hand do the 
&gt;trick...
&gt;is there better way to take out the speedo?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;William
&gt;
&gt;71 Westy
&gt;
