Subject: 65 camper, engine back in

........not!  

i woke up too early feeling like its time to take a lazy Sunday.    and it
was raining.    I also realised that i dont have new tranny boots and engine
to body seal anyway.

sometime this afternoon i did get inspired, though.    i reinstalled the
sender and the gas tank.   

  seeing as the bus looks so bad (i actually had a friend ask me today why i
was bothering to put work into it !), i decided to clean up the engine tin
and paint it.   this involved finding the rear and front pieces, which were
both missing, and cleaning up all the tin at the car wash.   i hate paint,
 so i held my breath while painting.    not the best paint job, wont win any
awards, there are some drips and some dust, but it'll be better than if i
didnt do it.  :)   the engine compartment paint is really nice, so it'll go
with.

I pressure washed the oil cooler too, then blew it out at the gas station,
and set it by a light bulb for a final drying.

then i polished up the gas cap, and thought about makingpatchwork corduroy
seat covers for the front.   and having a painting party, see whats in those
paint cans that have been in the garage since before in moved in.
