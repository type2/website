&gt; You know that you have reached a new plane of conciousness when....

&gt; your painstakingly rebuilt, spanking new, shiny 2 liter longblock that
&gt; you only installed 2 weeks ago begins ticking, quietly at first, then
&gt; it gradually gets louder and louder until it sounds like the Hammers
&gt; of Hell beating the very life out of the engine.

&gt; The engine that has become like your baby over the weeks that it took
&gt; you to transform it from it's dirty, neglected beat down condition
&gt; back to a like new condition. The Hammers finally getting so loud
&gt; inside your baby that you run to kill the ignition before something
&gt; comes flying through the case and really puts an end to it.
&gt;
&gt; You know that you have reached this state when this happens
&gt; and you don't
&gt; yell,
&gt; scream,
&gt; kick the dog,
&gt; or yourself.
&gt; You know when you have reached VW Zen when you just quietly pack up
&gt; your toolbox, lock up your bus for the night, and go to bed.
&gt; Tomorrow is another day...
&gt;
&gt; That said,
&gt; Does anyone know of a reputable and experienced aircooled VW mechanic in
&gt; the New York
&gt; City area?

Grasshopper!!!!  When you  reach the end of one level, it only means it is
time to go for the next level!  Descend those stairs! Slay that Balrog!
(whoops... mixed metaphors :-)

What is happening sounds like it will be *very* simple to fix, honest!  It
sounds to me like one of the adjuster screw lock nuts has come loose and
the adjuster is backing off.  Pull both of the valve covers off, look at
all the adjusters, try to turn the lock nuts by hand.  Did one or more
turn?  If so, rotate the engine until that cylinder is at TDC (write if
you need instructions) and readjust that valve.  In less than 10 miles, it
is near certain you have done no damage.
