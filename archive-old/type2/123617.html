Subject: [F] REAL bus music!

not just tunes to listen to in your bus... songs about (and BY) busses...

oddly, both groups are from australia; the first is JUNIORMAN, who 
sing of being suckers for girls in 23-windows.
the cover features a nice roth-inspired bus, and the inside is a pic 
of the shifter linkage! i doubt any other copies of this ep made it 
out of australia.

the second is by A KOMBI... this is music MADE by a bus! the guy 
end-rolled his bus down a road similar to telegraph hill, and ever 
after the radio made weird howling sounds when he drove. he made a 
whole record of the various noises; here's one track. warning - play 
loud at own risk!!
