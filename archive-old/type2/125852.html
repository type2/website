Subject: RE: [T2] No new Type II

Ron, 
     I think you are right about this.  One more thing to add, the retro appeal 
is very volatile.  Anyone who works in the consumer food business 
(supermarketing, food processing) will tell you that the dessert category is 
known as 'flavor du jour' -- something new sells for awhile, then drops 
quickly.  A product that took lots of development time/cost can be quickly 
eclipsed.  I would suggest that the 'retro' theme is much the same.  Chrysler 
cobbled the PT Cruiser together out of Neon parts -- keeping costs low -- and 
absorbed much of the nostalgia market.  I would bet many non-VW-traditionalist 
prospects opted for a PT instead of the NB.

As far as another minivan is concerned, the market has moved elsewhere.  Moms 
who listen to their kids don't want to be seen dead in a minivan.  The kids 
like SUVs and have no knowledge of, or interest in, the Type 2 history.  Except 
for a few diehard VW enthusiasts, the sales potential for the new Type 2 is 
questionable, and when you layer-on the poor styling job [my opinion here] and 
forecast high prices, even folks on this List will start looking at 
alternatives.  Just my 2&quot;.......

From: &quot;The Bus Depot&quot; &lt;type2_at_busdepot_dot_com&gt;

&gt; I was just reading in the Oct issue of VW Trends that 
&gt; Volkswagen has decided not to produce the New Bus. 

..Frankly their decision was probably smart. The New Microbus, as they had
envisioned it, would have ended up being a $40k to $50k minivan at
current currency conversion rates. This is in sharp contrast to the New
Beetle, which, like the old one, was a relatively affordable car. For
that matter, it's in sharp contrast to every other commercially
successful &quot;retro-mobile&quot; (Miata, PT Cruiser, Mini), all of which were
affordably priced. Plus, the New Microbus' styling didn't evoke the old
Microbus nearly as well as the New Beetle evoked the old one. I think
the concept was fatally flawed from the start....  - Ron Salmon
