Subject: '68 parts bus or not?

Howdy Volks,

I was driving thru my old neighborhood yesterday evening (our very own student slum next to the UT campus,  the hallowed Fort Sanders area) when I spotted a vehicle of the Bus persuasion rusting away in an alley, a '68 Deluxe Stationwagon, to be exact.  I  had remembered this bus from earlier cruises thru the Fort,  but it had slipped my mind as of late.  Seeing as I just bought a '69 Westy, I thought I might look the owner up to see if he'd sell (give) it to me for parts.  It has _3_ complete engines in it, a trans, all the original Deluxe panels, and the too-cool Deluxe polished aluminium body belt trim, all intact.  All of the glass is good, wheels, accessories, etc. are there, but the body has spent one too many winters in South Dakota (Plates are SD) and is in tough shape.  My question is: anyone have an opinion on the approximate value of such a find?  Also, Does anyone know who carries the clips to hold on the wide aluminium trim?  I can't seem to find them listed in !
any of my catalogs.

Any insight appreciated.

Blake
