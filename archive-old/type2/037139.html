Hello All,

Great to see the list back up.  Thanks to all those that put in lots of work to bring it back up.  Voodoo magic to a functional computer-illiterate like me...

I've searched the library, archives and net for an NOS or repro key for my bus, but can't find one.  I think WWest and RMMW carry them, but not the L-profile.  (I sure did learn alot about keys, though...)  One old posting mentioned someone named Gabriel in CA, belongs to SOTO, as having some NOS blanks and being able to cut keys.  I'm looking for either an NOS or repro L-profile blank (with the VW cutout.)  I had no problems finding a locksmith who had generic blanks and had spares made.  I'd appreciate it if anyone has any leads on this.  

Thanks,

Markus Bahnemann

P.S.  Great article by Ron Van Ness on lock maintenance in the library.
