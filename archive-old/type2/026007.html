&gt; I have a 1970. I can not for the life of me bang the outer race out of the
&gt; hub. Any hints or tricks?

Put the brake drum in the freezer for a day or so. Then use the biggest
hammer you have on the race.

I've had to replace a bearing on the same wheel on my b*g twice. First time
was in July, and it took a great deal of motivation (a number of serious
hits) from a 16-lb sledge to get it out. Second time was on a January
morning, and mere suggestion (one decent whack) from a 5-lb sledge popped it
right out.
