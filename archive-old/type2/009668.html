	Dave Brodbeck describes his formerly FI engine equipped with 
dual Weber 34 ICTs backfiring through the carbs above 2K rpm. Gee, 
that sounds like a spark problem to me. Too much static or dynamic 
advance producing a spark when the intake valve is still open? 
 
	What if you disconnect and plug the vacuum lines?

	I've had 'backfires' from bad sparks allowing combustable
mixture into a hot exhaust where it goes off. I thought it was a carb
problem too. Not so.
