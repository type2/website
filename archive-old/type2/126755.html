Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust inside the bus - update

If you don't get the exhaust pipe into the slipstream at the rear lower left 
and right as it appears you have done, the exhaust will flow up the back in 
the space at the immediate rear.  Sounds like you have hit on the solution.  The 
missing seal will let outside air into the bus including other exhaust if you 
are in traffic.  I was driving home in traffic a few days ago in my Neon and 
had the outside air coming in and could smell the exhaust fumes from all the 
traffic.  We are polluting the air and are stuck with the consequences.
