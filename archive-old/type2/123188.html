&gt; &gt; The other thing that's commonly done here when reinstalling races is to heat
&gt; &gt; the hubs in a hot oven while the races stay in the freezer.  This typically
&gt; &gt; lets the races get started in the hubs easily at which point you can tap
&gt; &gt; then into place.

&gt; It's a good idea if it's a tight fit. I'd personally just start with
&gt; freezing the races and see how far I get with that.

yeah that is all I do, I put em in the freezer (in plastic bags) the night
before I use em.  has always worked fine
