Subject: Engine Removal and Teardown

Hi all,

I'm in the process of rebuilding my '78 2.0L.  I had some great VW (not VWoA) 
karma this weekend and managed to get the engine out.  Not a single problem 
removing CV joint bolts even!  Wheeled the engine and tranny into the garage to 
begin teardown.

Unfortunately, my karma must have run out.  My roommate pulled her car into the 
garage to park and actually hit my engine!  Luckily no major damage, but the 
sheet metal that curves around the alternator (the dipstick plugs into this 
piece) is bent and won't mate up with the rearmost tin that I'd already 
removed!  ANYONE know where I could get this one piece of tin for the type IV???

Also, have all tin screws removed but 1.  The little bugger's head is stripped.

Other than these probs, all is good.

TIA for any help on the engine tin!

Beth in Houston
