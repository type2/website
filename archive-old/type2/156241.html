Subject: Re: [T2] Are the Asian CV joints any good?

&gt; I have been running Asian-made CV Joints and Boots on my 84 Westy (same as

Two years is hardly a long term test.  I hope that they are just as good
after 10 years.  Otherwise, you could have the GEX of CVs!

&gt; Nary a
&gt; problem with any clicking or clacking and the Boots have lasted far
&gt; longer than I would have expected, even more than some so-called &quot;German&quot;
&gt; Meiserwhatiz or Febi Boots I've used in the past.

I agree about the boots.  German rubber has never impressed me with its
longevity.  I use nothing but Rockford (US made) boots now

&gt; Get with it folks, more and more
&gt; &quot;OE&quot; stuff is beginning to be funneled through Germany/Europe from sources
&gt; such as China and will increase as time goes on.

True, but there is also an outpouring of poorly made products.  Seems that
there needs to be a non-Chinese company hovering over the quality control
to make sure that the Chinese factory maintains standards.

Even if a &quot;name&quot; manufacturer is buying product from a Chinese company it
doesn't mean that the company is maintaining quality on other products.
