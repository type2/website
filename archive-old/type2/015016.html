Subject: Building a Roof Rack for ~$100.00
Mime-Version: 1.0

I'm in the process of building a very sturdy roof rack for my Riviera for
just over $100. It will serve as a carrying device for my 200+ lb canoe and
an alternative to a boat trailer, which would have required a hitch and
cost upwards of $500 total, I think. There is minimal welding involved in
this rack and I'm pretty certain it could be done completely without
welding if need-be. A few modifications would bring the price down
considerably--below $70.00, I'm sure.

This is not a roof rack for purists; it's for the budget-minded person who
sees the bus as a utility-type vehicle. The rack is made of zinc-coated
channel which is readily available (I got mine at Home Despot). It won't
require painting, but I will use a rubber coating for the legs, which sit
in the gutter of the bus...and I'll probably use some sealer on each
cutting point to minimize the possibility of rust.

This is going to be a very versatile rack. The height is adjustable from
just above the camper top to 10 inches above the camper top (more for
Westies, as their camper top is shorter than the Riviera). There are 3 sets
of legs and the rack is 10 feet long, which is about the length of the
camper part of the bus.

Instead of spending my time writing this up, I thought I'd post and see if
there's any interest in details of this build. It'll probably be about a
week before I could finish an article on this, but picture taking time is
nigh if I'm going to do it. I'll finish the rack no later than tomorrow
evening. (I'm also building a dolly to move my canoe from bus to water;
otherwise I'd finish the rack today.)

Drop me a note if you think these plans would be useful to you.

Thanks! Joe
