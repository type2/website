X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

Hello fellow VW-crazies:
Thanks a ton to all of you who have replied to my currently non-running '77 
FI Westy....I properly checked the spark last night and found that I have no 
spark to the plugs, in fact.  Just for fun I checked the spark coming from 
the coil again, and still found a very minimal one--no snapping, no bluish 
color...just a small, tired looking white spark; again, only when held 
really close to the ground.  Also, for shits and giggles I cleaned my points 
with some paper (is it normal to have some oil-looking substance rub off?) 
and put on a new condenser.  Nuthin'.  To me it's looking more and more like 
my problem is a fried coil--which many of you figured it was anyhow.  If any 
of this info helps with more theories---I'm all ears!  Also, I'm looking for 
suggestion on where/how to wire my radio so I can listen to it while my bus 
is off--not much fun sitting around a campfire without the tunes.  It's also 
not fun frying coils ;)

Thanks again everyone~
Chet
p.s.  Quick question...I've got RV plates on my bus here in Minnesota which 
is about all my buddies need to convince them it's alright to have a few in 
the back when on roadtrips--I'm assuming this isn't legal, but I'd still 
like to hear it from someone!  (Not that it's gonna change anything...just 
be interested in hearing =)
