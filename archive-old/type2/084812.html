Good point. To be honest, I have no idea, and I'm gonna guess 
and speculate a little. 

I think there still is -some- rotation of the valve, because the 
tip of the adjuster still touches the valve stem off center, and 
I think the foot of the swivel adjuster still rubs the valve 
stem a bit, thus promoting valve rotation. Seeing how Porsche 
used them in the aircooled sixes..  very different engine and 
valve train..  I agree .. maybe the Porsche has more lift and 
the little rubbing of a swivel type adjuster is considered 
enough in those engines. I'd love to read facts about this one.
