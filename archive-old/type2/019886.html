&gt; While it's true we are retired and so don't have the gotta-get-back

&gt; then.

Last year, I drove my $1500, 1960 single cab hauling a manx style dune buggy in
the bed. 500 miles round trip.  Of course, I follow a good preventive program
and replace worn parts with new when available.  I also drive like I know what
the capabilities of my vehicles are.

&gt; they leave the upper left engine hanger bolt out of the upright &quot;because
&gt; it's hard to get to&quot;.

I've had no problem in using several extentions and a swivel.  Converting to the
capture nut in the case makes it even easier.

&gt; Anyone running with 3 bolts?

Just helped a guy swap out an upright.  Had 3 bolts.  New engine is secure with
4.

Hey, do those VW shops also feel free to only hold on the wheels with 2 or 3
bolts?  There's a time saver.
