&gt; Can anyone tell me how to duplicate the finish in a 71 Westy? I have the
&gt; birch plywood panels all cut and sanded but I can't figure out how to match
&gt; the finish on the old panels. The stains I found are either to white or too
&gt; yellow. Any help would be appreciated as this is the last thing I have to do
&gt; before putting the bus all back together so I can go play. Any help would be
&gt; greatly appreciated. TBear

&gt; The Zar's is a thick stain (use a cloth for application), but when you
&gt;  apply the polyurethane, it tends to lighten/yellow the finish a bit. 
&gt;  I've decided to go with only one coat of the stain, which results in a
&gt;  lighter than stock look, but I like that since I like the wood grain.

I used Minwax Wood Conditioner (&quot;for even stain penetration on soft wood&quot;), 
Minwax Pastels #800 Winter White stain (which you brush on heavy and wipe off 
with a dry rag to achieve the desired look), and finally, 3 coats of V 
arathane Elite Diamond Outdoor Semi Gloss Clear Finish (sand each coat before 
the next).  The latex top coat does not yellow as it ages like oil based 
polyurethane, but is tough.  It is made mainly for hardwood floors.  However, 
after 5 years, I believe it has yellowed very slightly. It is currently 
almost identical to the original finish.  Whatever you use, go for whiter 
than what you want on the stain because the clear coat will yellow somewhat 
over time.  The original faux &quot;wood grain&quot; finish was painted on without a 
clear top coat so it would not change color too much over time.
