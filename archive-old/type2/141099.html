Subject: Re: [T2] 78 bus won't start

If you think it is that wire, or want to prove that it is getting fuel, just
bypass the fuel pump double relay, so the pump runs all the time.  Muir's
book explains the detail of this procedure.

There is no wire stock grounding to the tin, but there is a wire that is
supposed to ground in that area, by the double relay and the injector
resistors, to the wall.





&gt; Check all your FI wires again (and the spark plug
&gt; wires too). There's a single wire that allows the fuel
&gt; pump to run AFTER cranking. I can't recall if it
&gt; connects to the dizzy or grounds to the case. It's
&gt; easy to miss. That might give you some fuel while
&gt; cranking, but then it would die.
