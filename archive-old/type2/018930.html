not sure if this is off topic or not.
 
I'm driving to Huntsville, Alabama from
Iowa City in a couple of hours.
 
Any suggestions for cool places to stop
and see on the way back home?  I've never
been that direction of the country at all.
 
I will be returning the night of the 15th, so
I'll probably stop and camp and look for
someplace to go mountain biking or to play
pinball.


thanks

matt
