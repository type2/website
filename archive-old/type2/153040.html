Subject: Re: [T2] 1 Ton Tires

&gt; In a 14&quot; size, our Hankook 185R14's will handle just under a ton per 
&gt; tire
&gt; (1874 lbs; 2000 lbs is a ton). It also happens to be an excellent 
&gt; tire, very
&gt; highly rated in the German press.

Hi all,

I highly agree with Ron Salmon.  I have put 3,000 miles on a set of 
Hankooks in the past week.  Even driving through Wyoming on I-80 with 
wind gusts to 45 mph, my loaded 76 Westy was stable and steady at 70 
mph.  They are GREAT tires!

Jeff
