I think due to financial problems, i'm going to have to part with my baby.
She's a red 71 westy in beautiful condition.  Within the last 3000 miles
she's
got:
new windshield w/rubber
new tires
new brakes
new clutch
rebuilt tranny
rebuilt engine
new CV's
new Ball joints

I'm not quite sure what to ask for her, so make offers.
there's very very little rust, just a few small spots of surface rust...very
small.  There's a small dent in the drivers door, but other then that the
body
is perfect.
email me with questions or offers.
peace
dave
