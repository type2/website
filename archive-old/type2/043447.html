&gt; My brand new rebuild motor with less than 3 miles runs fine but sounds like
&gt; there is metal grinding together somewhere.  Its like a shimmering sound
&gt; below the usual purr of a 1600 dp.  Sounds like its coming from the
&gt; alternator.  Does anybody know what this is?

The fan's rubbing against something, and that something's usually the fan
shroud. This one's easy to fix: loosen the two screws at the ends of the fan
shroud, all the 10mm bolts that hold the alternator backing plate to the fan
shroud, and remove the alternator belt. Leave the alternator strap in place.

Then turn the alternator pulley by hand and move the fan shroud (on a Bus, a
crowbar comes in handy for this--that shroud is a long way in there) until
you quit hearing rubbing. When the rubbing goes away, tighten everything
and, before you reinstall the belt, turn the alternator pulley again. No
scraping noise? Good.
