&gt;  The thread on warm air for the type IV carbs has triggered these
&gt;  questions.
&gt;  
&gt;  Why preheat the carb air?  Does it make a difference in a FI system?
&gt;  

Why pre-heat the carb air?

Well the down stroke of the piston sucks air in through the intake valve from
the input mainfold. This lowering of pressure in the input manifold causes air
to be sucked through the carb.

In the carb there is a constriction known as a Venturi, for the same volume of
air to pas through the constriction as is being drawn through the manifold it
must move faster (it is this rapidly moving air at low pressure that SUCKS
fuel through the jet).
Well its a basic rule of phyics that for a gas 
            Pressure * Volume = temperature * constant
the pressure and volume change as the air/fuel mixture goes through the carb
and cuse the temperature of the mixture to drop.

Now the air contains moisture (humidity) and warm air can carry more moisture
than cold air (hense consensation on the cold windows of a warm room). On a
cold day the lowering of temerature can cause condensation on the inside of
the cold manifold and this condensation can freeze - this constricts the flow
of air/fuel mixture and strangles the engine. 

So the air is heated to prevent input manifold icing and to improve the fuel
carrying capacity of the air. As the engine gets warm the input manifold gets
hot and so condensation no longer happens in it. Very cleverly the preheat air
is thermosticaly turned off and the colder engine compartment air only is used
- this of course does get slightly warmed by being in the engine compartment..

On an FI engine the fuel is injected right up near the cylinders ie after the
air has passed through the contrictions of the air volume/mas measurer so
icing does not appear to be a problem - it should be noted that as the latest
Brazilian 1600 engines are FI they have no provision for any thermosatic
control of the air (no fan housing flaps or thermosat) the FI brain has input
from temperature sensors which adjust the fuel and enable a quick warmup
without them.

Good luck
Bob
