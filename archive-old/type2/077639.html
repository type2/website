Subject: Re: [T2] 12v to 6 v starter?

&gt; I have heard in the past that a few guys have been using 6 volts starters on 
&gt; their 12 volt systems.  They say it had better starting power and more torque

&gt; there any pro's or cons to using the 6 volt starter?  Also is the bushing the 
&gt; same?  And if the only draw back is wearing out a starter quicker, no biggy 
&gt; I'll throw the old 12 volt inside just in case.

I did it years ago with an 1500S type III engine, never had any problem
and it really cranked. but you couldn't stay on the starter for very long
if you wanted it to last.

big problem is the teeth are different, I used an older 6v flywheel
