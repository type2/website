Subject: blinkers, Thank you

Problem solved! My 71 is now ready to pass inspection, just wish I could fix 
the oil leak on the left side of the engine without removing the engine. 
Thanks everyone for your input, only thing is I also had to remove two gold 
fish out of the relay.

Next up trying to cure the leak or bring along a battery powered hair dryer.
