Subject: Left Side sliding door

So how hard would it be to put in a sliding door on the left side?  I can
think of plenty of times a door on the drivers side would have been handy.
Are there parts available to do a conversion?  What about cutting that panel
out, would that detract from the integrity of the structure?

By the way, how might I get the roof off without sending everything
a-sunder?
