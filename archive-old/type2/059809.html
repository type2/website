Subject: Brake Vacuum Lines, '71

Volks:
Continuing the saga:

Can anyone tell me the size, diameter, and sequence of
the brake vacuum lines after they come through the
firewall?  There's definately a leak somewhere, and
I've just plugged it up for now at the manifold, but
since it's been replaced in a very half-assed fashion
at sometime in its existence, it's impossible for me to tell.

Oh, and does anyone have a dual advance distributer
they'd like to trade/sell cheap?  It'd be nice to have
my new carb (34 pict 3) working with the correct distributer.

TIA, 
Dan
