I know it's a pain cleaning the case etc.. But sloshing 1/2 a gallon of carb
cleaner around the case (let alone disposal) is more pollution by ourselves,
than an average person (no mechanical maniac tendencies) make in their
life-time!

If you HAVE (yes we all NEED them) to use such environmentally harsh
methods, try just a small amount &amp; a bit of elbow grease (mail me if you
don't know what that is). You may sweat &amp; cus, but they don't kill &amp; pollute
the environment.
