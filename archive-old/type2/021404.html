Subject: Seat stand mat painting


Just a small success story:

My seat stand mats were in good shape, no tears really, but really faded, looking all of their 32
years.  I spent $6 on three bottles of &quot;Plasti-Kote Odds n Ends&quot; brush on fast dry enamel, gloss
black, and they look absolutely brand new.  Makes my interior look infinitely better...
