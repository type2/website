I always count on a 7&quot; grinder with a 36grit wheel on it.  This is an angle
grinder with a sandpaper disc on it.  The sandpaper discs are actually a
bonded resin and come in grits from 16 (rocks glued to a disc) all the way
up to maybe 180 grit or so.  When I was working in the boat yard we used it
to remove material every day.  The angle grinders usually cost about $200
dollars..maybe you could rent one.  The one I use now is a variable speed
Makita sander/polisher.

as Frank once said &quot;never underestimate the power of a grinder&quot;

I've used this grinder to take all the paint off of a number of big houses.
It is fantastic for removing and shaping bondo.

There is an accessory called a &quot;soft pad&quot;  a foam backed disc.  a good one
costs between $20 and $50.  You glue fine sandpaper to the face and it can
really give you a smooth finish in a very short time.
