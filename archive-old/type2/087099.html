Subject: Watch For Tom...

Tom Tarka, who's posts many of you have answered, is currently on his way 
to New Orleans for a conference, and is traveling in his blue and white 
hard top, with california plates. If you see him on the road say hello! He 
asked me to post to let all of you now to watch out for him.

-Nick
