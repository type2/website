Subject: Update on Tunes Tank

------=_NextPart_001_0003_01C247AD.22E17370

Hey all..

Thanks for the tips on how to repair my 1978 gas tank...Mike, my mechanic=
, is taking the tank out of Tunes and is having a radiator shop clean and=
 paint and do all those things you guys suggested. In fact, he is going t=
o try to remove the tank the way one of you all suggested; over the engin=
e after removing the stuff on top! If that does not work, he'll do it the=
 more traditional way...

So once again, thanks; you guys the greatest. And hopefully this will tak=
e care of the problem and I can get the bus back by Wednesday...Then I wi=
ll start the repairs to the body...Rust never sleeps.
