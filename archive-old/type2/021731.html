Subject: Re: [T2] rear axle fell off (!)

Eddie, Chris:
Just not tight enough to begin with. Look it up, use a torque wrench. It's way tighter than
you can get by hand with a simple L-shaped wrench! I often have trouble breaking them loose
with an air wrench years later and it's not cause they are rusty, it's cause they are tight!

&gt; May just be the nature of the beast.
&gt;
&gt; Your CV joint may be fine and require a simple reinstall.
&gt;
&gt; Lock-tite anyone?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;The Right Rear axle was completely free of the rear wheel, bolts and all.
&gt; &gt;The bolts all looked ok... as if it had just been removed from the
&gt; &gt;wheel......as did the threads they go into..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The boom was the joint breaking(for lack of a better word) free and the
&gt; &gt;banging was the free axle whacking the torsion arm (as well as everything
&gt; &gt;in reach i would imagine)
