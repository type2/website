For all those that are looking to replace the Westfalia 
Prancing Horse stickers on their bay window busses here is 
one (of many I am sure) of where you can get those 
stickers..

Michael Steinke (Westfalia God)
Hagebuttenweg 10
60433
Frankfurt

When I bought the stickers i think it cost approx $10.00 for 
about 10 stickers that were 3&quot; long by about 13/4&quot; tall
