Subject: Re: [T2] Cold start &amp; Oil filler gaskets

&gt; I am trying to find the gaskets for both the oil filler tube/pipe to case
 and the cold start valve to intake manifold. So far I have not even been
 able to find a part # for either much less the gaskets. Searched BD and
 Motorworks, plus checked the archives.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The part number of the oil filler tube gasket is 071 115 315 A

The part number of the cold start valve gasket is 022 133 075 A

Bus Depot shows them at a cost of 4.37 and 1.95 each but no description
so unless you have the part number, you would never find them! They are paper. You can make the cold start one
easily with a paper punch but the oil filler one will be tough,
