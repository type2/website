&gt; Got a question. I just got my '78 Westy back from the painter last
&gt; weekend. I need to install the glass after I have removed the old
&gt; window tint.
&gt; 
&gt; What can I use to lubricate the rope I use to pull the window gaskets into
&gt; place? Liquid soap is said to contain something (phosphates ?) that will
&gt; promote rust later since it will remain trapped by the rubber and glass.

I've heard that as well.

&gt; Which would you use? Armor-All or the equivalent, silicone spray, or hiker's
&gt; soap (supposedly contains nothing like phosphates? 

I've heard of people using silicone spray, though I can't recommend it due
to inexperience.  Armor-All is a definite no-no.  it's been known for
years to dry our rubber products.  As someone else mentioned, I hear
Glycerin might be just the ticket.

&gt; Finally how do I get the old tinting off of the glass? The side windows are
&gt; easy - a razor blade should do fine. However the rear window has the defroster
&gt; strips and they are good condition so I don't want to ruin them. Vinegar in
&gt; bathtub for a soak? 

Hmmm, perhaps someone else can help on that.  You might want to pop into
an auto parts shop or a hardware store and read the boxes for window
tinting.  They should include info on removal.  

&gt; I'd appreciate any help or advice you can offer. Please reply directly
&gt; when you can as I would like to work this afternoon and won't be able
&gt; to wade through all of the rest of my mail quickly (I read 4 or 5
&gt; lists - it's filtered and sorted but still takes time) enough!

Yeah, I noticed.  As an FYI, the 914_at_porschelist_dot_org was renamed to
914_at_rennlist_dot_org, though it may still be forwarding on to the new address.
Also, as I understand it the 914's winshield in installed a way totally
different than the VW.  They're probably wondering what the heck you're
talking about with lubricating rope for a winshield install.  :)
