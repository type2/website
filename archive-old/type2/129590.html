Subject: Re: [T2] Can't get it to run right cont'd

I think I would 1st confirm TDC. Wooden dowel or pencil in the sprakplug hole, roll engine over until it stops on the pencil, mark the fan at the 12 o'clock position or at zero degrees if you have a timing scale - you should, roll it the other way until it stops. Muir's book explains it better. 

If TDC is in the right place (your factory timing mark is roughly between your two paint marks) then quite simply you've got carb probelms IMHO. It may be adjusted or jetted wrong. Check that distributor too -0 does it advance, is it the right numbers for your application?

I've been around VW engines since 1991 and tuned alot of them - even with dual Dells and Webers. The two engines I tuned with the Holley carb were poor. The carb needed rejetting or adjustments I could not seem to give them. I suspect jetting. Those engines had the same problems you describe. Both engines had major vaccum leaks in the intake manifold boots and at the heads where the intake manifold bolts up. Poor aftermaket parts were these... 

About the carb: Does you accelerator pump work? Is the bowl clean? Are the idle jets clean? The carb butterfly closed completely or is the cable hold it open a bit? Does the cable open the butterfly completely? Is the throttle shaft leaking vacuum? Float set right? 

Good luck and let us know what happens. 

Chris
