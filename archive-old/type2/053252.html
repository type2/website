Subject: more on pedestal mats...

Thanks for the responses to my pedestal mat problems.  For those of you
who inquired,  the pedestal mats I ordered are rubber and they  wrap
around the side to the back.  I had one guy respond that he has a 72 and
he purchased mats from Wolfsburg West and they fit fine so I am thinking
maybe the mats I have are not made for a 76.  I also had received email
&gt;from a guy with a 73 who had a good fit.  It seems that the seat
pedestal in the early 70's bus is not as high as the later years.  So if
there is anyone who has a late 70's bus who has purchased pedestal mats
that are a good fit please let me know.
Thanks again,
Phillip
76 Westy
