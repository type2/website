Subject: looking at a bus

I would buy this in a heartbeat if it wasn't for one thing.
What I'm looking at is a 78 westy with all the camping gear working, 
mild to normal wear and tear on the interior and one small worn spot 
on the canvas. Little rust and a rebuilt transmission.
All this for $2,000, or less if I dicker.
My problem and me question for the list.
Some nut in nevada install a buick 231 V6 in the backend.
Lots of plumbing wandering to the front where a radiator, enclosed in 
a beautiful westy orange metal box, has been bolted to the front of 
the van.
I'm really confused.
The only car I've had with water shoved through it was an 85 vanagon 
and it was loosely designed to accept a radiator...I still prefer my 
80 air-cooled westy.
What is this engine? Is it any good? How hard would it be to go back 
air-cooled? I have a spare 2L in the shed waiting for a rebuild.
One final thing. It tends to run hot in the summer, leaks a slight 
bit of oil at the rear of the engine and the starter needs 
rebuilding, replacing.
Should I run, walk, hop, skip and jump away for this thing.
Buy it anyway for its strange uniqueness and learn to live with buick.
Get the bodywork and paint done on my 80?
Advice, recommendations are welcome.
Thanks for tolerating my ramblings.
