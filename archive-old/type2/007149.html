Hi all,

If I read this right the 009 isn't a good choice for my 73' 1.8L setup.  If
this is the case, which dizzy is the right one for my 
FI type four?

Thanks,

it.

  Seth,
  
  It will fit, your bus will run.
  
  however, whether it &quot;works&quot; or not is a matter of debate.....
  
  The advance curve is wrong for the type 4 engine.
  It does not provide the total advance that the type 4 engine needs.
  There are no timing specs for it on the type 4 engine, you will have to
fudge 
  it.
  You can get the timing close to correct at 3400rpm OR idle, but NOT for
both.
  
  You will lose some performance and drivability.  (otherwise EVERY bus
would 
  have come with one originally!!)
  
  How much are you willing to compromise your bus for the savings in $$?  It

  WILL work; you will just have to decide what you might lose by using it as
an 
  alternative and whether its_worth_it_or_not.
  
  I personally would get one of the dual advance distributors that 
  Aircooled_dot_net sells.  they provide centrifugal advance based on engine rpm

  PLUS you get additional advance based on carb venturi vacuum, (for that 
  little extra kick, just when you need it).  You can also gain up to 4
extra 
  mpg in fuel economy.  
  
  (They are similar to what the bus originally came with)
