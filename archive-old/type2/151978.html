&gt; I've had a few interesting weekends working on my bus.
&gt; Seems like everytime I &quot;upgrade&quot; my bus, it runs worse.
&gt; Prior to any work on my '79 FI engine, here were my symptoms.
&gt;
&gt; Engine cold: Starts right up...after running for about 10
&gt; seconds, starts to die. Hit the accelerator and it idles
&gt; barely.
&gt;
&gt; Engine warm: Crank for 5-8 seconds, no start. Accelerator
&gt; pedal all the way down, crank again, starts right up. Idles
&gt; barely. Sometimes a 3rd cranking is required.
&gt;
&gt; Engine hot: Cranks and starts right up. Idles ok.

&gt; warmed up and then barely stays running. Drives ok though. I must have
&gt; knocked SOMETHING loose while messing around in the engine compartment. I
&gt; look and look, nothing...except I notice the rubber elbow going to the aux
&gt; air regulator is split on the regulator end and has slid off a couple mm.
&gt; I push it back on. That was the only thing I could find out of place.

I agree sounds like you might have knocked something loose,  I would check
the AFM plug, it is on the back of the air intake just to the left of the
air cleaner.  if that plug comes loose or out it can act just like you
mention.   other things that can have that effect are

bad or unplugged temp sensor II  (screwed into head by cyl #3)

also any leak in the vacuum hose system will FUBAR the operation of the
the engine....so check those hoses....

good luck
Bob
