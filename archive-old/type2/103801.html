&gt; at the electrical apparatus in there. It looks like too much work to be a
&gt; dummy, lots of wires etc.

VErrry strange!  Obvious air intakes.  Looks like the cylinders are one
piece and they have cooling fins.  Looks like the remains of a distributor
in place, which wouldn't work for a compressor.  several heavy-duty
semiconductors (SCRs?) with massive heat sinks.  A little guage off to the
left, but I can't tell what it measures.  Workmanship looks reasonably
good, but not quite factory quality.

If I had to guess, I'd say that it was some sort of test mule for an
exotic-fuel, or exotic cycle engine.  I'd expect to find something like
this laying around a university ME department.
