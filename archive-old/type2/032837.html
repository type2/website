Hi All,

Well since it's Friday down here in Australia I though I'd put out a call
for some stuff for my websites.  First up there's the Baja Bus site at
http://www.baja_dot_com/kombi I'm after road trip stories for this one and any
pics etc you might have of Buses going places they really shouldn't be, the
emphasis here is in offorad trips and modifying your Bus for this.  If you
haven't seen it before checkout the Pics of major lifted Buses jumping sand
dunes etc :)

The other site is Wild Vw's at
http://www.geocities_dot_com/motorcity/garage/1811 Although this site covers all
types of VW's there's a definate bias towards Buses.  What I'm afer here is
engine conversions and that kinda stuff.   Even links would be good.
Currently there's V8, V6, Subaru etc conversions in Buses as well as WRX
engined Bugs and TypeIII's etc.

Anyway,
Cheers
Steve
