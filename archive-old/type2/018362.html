Subject: Oil Pressure on AVP
Message-ID: &lt;375930BA.32EFCB40_at_net-link_dot_net&gt;

Hi Gordon-

Just caught up on my mail this morning;  I've been putting in long hours
this week finishing a restoration of my '76 Westy.  I bought a new AVP
rebuild also and started it up last weekend.

To get the oil pressure going I had to:
    Take the spark plugs out to make it easier to crank
    Filled the oil filter before I installed it.
    Poured oil into the pressure gauge hole (actually a tube to remote
mount my oil pressure sender)
    Cranked about 60 seconds in 15 second bursts
    Recharged the battery overnight!
    Cranked about 30 seconds next morning and here comes the gauge
pressure with the light going off at the same time.

I ran it at 2000 rpm for a while (5 min) from info from Hoover and
Wilson, shut it down and let it cool, then repeated it a couple more
times.  It's hard to listen to and the heat that pours off it is scary.
AVP didn't give a break-in procedure, so  I'm hoping this is ok.
