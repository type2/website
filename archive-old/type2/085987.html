Subject: Re: [T2] Friday-Deadheads and busses

&gt;found some pretty creative repairs and patches here and there. I guess
&gt;my only real complaint is with the wiring -- why do people refuse to
&gt;use wire connectors?

Some shoddy wiring (around the radio only) is the one kludge I indulge 
myself in. Soldering proper connectors and so forth is just more work that I 
think the radio is worth, when twisting wires together and covering them up 
with masking tape does the job just fine. I keep telling myself &quot;next time 
it's warm, I'll solder them proper.&quot;
