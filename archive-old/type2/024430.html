Subject: VW Aircooled Club Advice/Employment
Message-ID: &lt;816441b7.2468e39b_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Does anyone have any advice on starting an aircooled VW club?  I have a '68 
bus, my neighbor has a '69, and some other people I know from work have 
several other busses and bugs.  Since owning my bus I notice other busses as 
well as other aircooled VW's and think there might be enough people 
interested to start some sort of club.  I don't want to get fancy, just 
create an opportunity for AC VW people to get together and exchange ideas, 
information, and sources, etc. as well as just hang out.  I'm in Great Falls, 
Montana, and as far as I know, there is no AC VW association of any kind in 
the state.  If there are any list members who belong to or are involved in a 
club, please p-mail me off the list (don't want to waste bandwidth).  

What do I do to earn $$ to keep my bus running?   I'm an Air Force Officer 
(Captain) and I'm a Minuteman III missile launch officer at Malmstrom Air 
Force Base.  I used to be an air traffic control officer (no, I didn't burn 
out, just no promotion opportunities), and I studied engineering.  My wife is 
a Chiropractor and we got the bus from her father who bought it new in Canada.
