Subject: Re: [T2] Weird sound... sounds bad... very bad...

Steve and the list, I have the same symptoms
regarding the clutch adjusting nut.  Clutch nut
is all the way in.  Even had to put some washers
on it when I replaced it with a brand new clutch
cable.  I didn't measure the cable, but the part
number was right.  I also replaced the bowden
tube, but it the TBD repacement was a soft
rubber.  No idea how to shape the thing like
bentley describes with the replacement tube being
as flexible as it is.  

Does this mean a new clutch, as Benthin suggests
and as the PO told me, or an almost worn out
clutch?  

I get a little noise when the clutch is not
depressed.  The noise changes when I depress the
clutch.  I also have difficulty shifting into
first and especially second.  I wrote this off to
bad synchronizers and am expecting to replace the
tranny.

Peace and blessings,
Ray Nemo, the Bus Captain
