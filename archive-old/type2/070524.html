&gt;I have heard of a place in LA called Tuttle (sp?) Machine that has a good
&gt;rep can anyone help me out here? Any other sources for quick turn around?

&gt;I had really wanted to take the bus on a little excursion I am planning the
&gt;last week of July.

&gt;Thanks in advance

I haven't heard of Tuttle, but perhaps you mean Riddle Machine Co. also
known as RIMCO. They have a very good rep. I have had some work done there
a couple of years ago, no complaints. They specialize in VWs. 
(714)549-0357
(800)331-4775 (outside of CA)
I happened to have their pricelist in my briefcase today as I am looking
into rebuilding my type IV engine.
