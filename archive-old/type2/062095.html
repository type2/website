Subject: Re: the clutch eater

Re clutch misalignment- in normal running, throwout bearing is not involved
(not spinning), unless very out of alignment and resting on the trans
shaft- could explain poor clutching also.  Have you checked needle bearing
that surrounds trans shaft?-, like if it's worn away (from sticking and
then wearing out), it would cause rattling of the clutch disk relative to
clutch plate/flywheel?  I personally wonder if this isn't involved in the
&quot;rattle&quot; I get when coasting at high revs or right after clutching (because
it's spinning), but I don't get chatter,........MB
