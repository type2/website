Subject: Camping Chairs

Hi all
I hope this isn't stretching the issue, but I am looking for lawn chairs to
carry in My VW Bus!
Would anyone have seen the Chairs that fold into a carry bag, specifically,
they are the TRIANGLE shaped ones that have arm rests, with Beer holders,,
also they have a foot rest,  and as they are triangular, the top is a head
rest.  You can fall asleep in these chairs, they are so comfy.
alas.. I seem to be able to find the square ones that fold up.. not the
TRIANGLE ones..
I need new ones to take camping.
Thanks
