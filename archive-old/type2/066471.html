Subject: how many miles on your bus

&gt; John Grunkemeier &lt;grunke_at_U.WASHINGTON.EDU&gt; asks
&gt;
&gt; How many miles are on the other buses out there?  Who's got the record?

Our dark blue bus has 320,000 miles, the blue and white has 312,000
miles. Each is on its second transmission and they have both used 5
or 6 engines. Each has been repainted once and they both need it
again soon.
