Subject: Busses and horns...

Well, time to take this thread off the &quot;Re: Busses as off-road vehicles&quot;
and start it on its own!

Do people really use horns?  Like most VW busses, I don't even know if mine
works, or what it sounds like.  By the time I need a horn, I'm too busy
trying to drive the bus to worry about expressing indignation.

Most of the time I hear horns is in traffic.  Do they expect the cars in
front of them to evaporate or something?  I admit that sometimes I think about
honking when the sleepy fellow in front of me fails to notice the light
change, but driving a VW for years, I get used to not-moving more than moving
sometimes.

I get Consumers Reports.  They don't really like VW's as a rule, but I still
read the evaluations of the Toyotas, etc.  What I really love is when they
rate cars with something like &quot;Well the car handled superbly, is cheaper than
dust, gets 100 miles per gallon.  We downrated it because of the poorly placed
horn button.&quot;  Really.  EVERY car evaluation seems to have to include a comment
on how easy or hard it was to honk the tooter.  Like that's the defining
characteristic of cars in New York (or maybe its New Jersey, where CU tests its
cars).  

When my horn did work, I'd have to pound on that little plastic button
hard, with verve and gusto!  &quot;Bee(p)&quot;.  Better not get too excited, there, 
I might attract some more mice with that squeak!

Where I live, we don't have any stoplights.  People leave their keys in the
ignition while parked at the store.  I don't think I've heard a horn except
to try to coerce some poor bovine off the tarmac (doesn't phase 'em).  So
you worldwide net community, here's the question:  Does your horn work, and
what is it for?

Next issue: Cup Holders: Can they really hold cups?

I know, Friday's still far away...
