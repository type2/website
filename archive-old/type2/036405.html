To All,

I am pleased to announce that Richard Palmer aka Poor Richard will be
handling T-shirt design, production and distribution for Everybus 2000.
Info on EveryBus can be found at
http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~vw69bus/everybus.html .
Info on Richard's previous cool bus shirt designs can be found at
http://www4.ncsu_dot_edu/eos/users/r/rapalmer/www/tshirts.html.

Richard is putting the final touches on the design for the Everybus shirts
and the screens will be ready soon!

IF YOU WANT a shirt please pre-order!!!!!!!!!!!! A limited number will be
available at the event but they will only be XL sized. If you want anything
other than XL you must pre-order. The price of the shirts is $15.00 and
delivery will be made at EveryBus. If you want it shipped prior we may be
able to work that out for the cost of shipping. See what Poor Richard has to
say about ordering:

&quot;......orders in ASAP, but by the end of March for sure, so there will be
enough time for me to order. Have them send payment to
Richard Palmer
121-C Park Ave
Raleigh, NC 27605-1832
and include an index card with quantity and size of shirt.&quot;
