Subject: Re: [T2] lOOKING FOR A STOCK TACH OR CLOCK FOR A 70 TRANSPORTER

NO need to cut the clock blank, i bought one of the adapter rings from busboys,
it didn't fit very well so i tossed it into the tool box.   The solution was to
use some brass stock I made a ring of it with both ends bent at 90 degrees
drilled a hole through the bent parts and put a bolt through the holes, like a
hoseclamp around the tach.  I soldered (its brass solder works fine) 2, 90
degree bent bits of the same brass, about 3/8 wide, that line up with the screw
holes for the original blank plate and put holes in these 90 degree bits and use
the same screws that held in the blank.  The vdo tach looks stock, matches the
rest of the gauges and it can all be removed and made original in a few minutes.
its held up and looks good for 3 years now.

&gt;   However, you can still cut the blank plate in your
&gt; dash and hot-glue the tach in, with very good results. Would have been
&gt; easier with the ring, but can be done without it.   (Incidentally, if anyone
&gt; has found something that works in place of that discontinued ring/holder for
&gt; the VDO gauge, I'd love to hear about it.)
