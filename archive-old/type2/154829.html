Subject: Re: [T2] Antenna Question

&gt; Here's a pic of the front 
&gt; of my bus - only one round hole.

&gt; pg.html 
&gt; 
&gt; Am I missing something? Do I need to drill an extra hole? 

My antenna is next to the drivers side A pillar, I don't know what that hole you have is for, did you narrowly escape a driveby shooting once?

Do you have a hole near your drivers side A pillar that looks like it might accomodate the standard antenna?  Can't see the spot where it would be in your picture
