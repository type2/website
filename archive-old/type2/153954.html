Subject: Re: [T2] rear seat belt bolt size

From: &quot;Billy P&quot; 


 Y'all,
 
 I've been throwing all manner of M10/M12 x 1.25/1.5/1.75 bolts at my rear seat
belt mounting holes to no avail, then I came across this in the archives:

 &gt;Are you sure they are 11mm??
I know seat belt bolts are 7/16&quot; fine thread on all cars. Perhaps this size
would work?
 
 What the hey? The King's threads in my VW?  Is is true?

Yes, seat belt holddown bolts are standardized worldwide. 7/16-20
