&gt; My new mechanic pal sez he thinks the thing to do is to fill the
&gt; cylinder with compressed air to hold the valve in place so's it don't
&gt; fall into the cylinder.  Anyone done this?  How much pressure would you
&gt; need to make sure that valve didn't go anywhere?
&gt; 
&gt; He figgers we can rig up a compression gauge with a t for the
&gt; compressor.  
&gt; 
&gt; Crazy?  How to fix replace a valve spring without pulling the engine, or
&gt; can you?

It's possible, and as long as you've got good compression it works. They
sell a special device for this. You pull the spark plug, screw this thing in
(it's cheap), take off the rocker arm and inflate the cylinder to 80PSI.
