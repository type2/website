&gt;&gt;Searched the Library and archives, but could not find the answer for this
&gt;&gt;one. the turn signals and emergency flashers on my 70 Westy all work fine,
&gt;&gt;but the Turn signal indicator lights on my dash both *blink* when I use my
&gt;&gt;turn signals. Left or right makes no difference, they both flash, while the
&gt;&gt;operation of the outside lights is correct. Anybody have this happen?
&gt;
&gt;Everyone, I think.  This is normal behavior.  :)

right-e-o.
question: do you know what it means when the green arrows on the speedo
blink once then discontinue, yet the blinking sound &amp; out slide blinkers
continue nonetheless. this happens when signalling left only.
