Subject: In Seattle

Hey all,

I'm in Seattle this week, gloriously escaping the confines of the
most densely populated state in the Union for a week (that would be NJ).
Unfortunately, it's a business trip.
In any case, if any of you Seattlites are interested in meeting
with me, I may have some free time Wed and Thurs evening (or I may not,
don't know yet).

Drop me email at my usual address &lt;boleyn_at_scr.siemens_dot_com&gt;, or, probably
better (maybe better... maybe not, I don't know!), try calling me at
my hotel room--uh.  Look up the Embassy Suites in Bellevue, ask for
me by name--Rodney Boleyn.

Been a little disappointed in number of bus sightings so far this trip.
Have seen a lot of nice beetle convertibles, though.  And a few nice buses.
Just not the amazing volume I saw last December when I was out here.

So anyway, I check my email once a day, usually towards evening 4-6p 
pacific.  And I get back to my hotel room shortly thereafter.  Let me know!

- -Rodney
