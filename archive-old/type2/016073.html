I didn't get any replies to this in two hours, so I decided to tear the
stand off a problem engine I had sitting in the garage.  This engine had an
alternator, so I figured it might be worth a look.

Anyway, I have two stands.  One is &quot;113.101.211 E&quot; the other is &quot;113.101
211G&quot;.  I took photos to be complete in this study:

The most relevant photo is this one:

Now, the one on the left &quot;113.101 211G&quot; seems to have less of a saddle --
and it has newer VW+AUDI stampings on it -- I take this is the Alternator
one (newer?).

P.S.  I am troubleshooting some computer problems, sorry my web site has
been down at recently.  Hopefully I will get this resolved by the end of the
week.

I have part number &quot;113.101.211 E&quot; -- a generator or alternator stand.

Can someone please help me determine which this is, a generator or
alternator stand?  What is the fundamental difference between a generator
and alternator stand, is the height different or anything of significance?

Thanks in advance.
