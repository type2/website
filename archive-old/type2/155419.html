Subject: Camper Window Help

Help...

I'm trying to get all the windows back in P-II before
it rains, but for the life of me I can't get those
camper-louvered windows in.  I have new seals, which
seem to be too tight of a fit between the window and
the bus.

The new seals look VERY similar to the originals. 
They are maybe a little plumper, but I'm assuming that
the originals got flattened a bit after 30 years.


Anybody had problems like this before?

Thanks,

Rick
