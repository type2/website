Subject: Re: Slick 50 treatment
Message-ID: &lt;3767ED4C.286B_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;

We tried the ol' slick 50 in our '80 (THE VAN FROM HELL. . .). 

Just 4 words : &quot;break engine in first!&quot;  We tried to treat with Slick 50
immediately after a rebuild and found that the rings wouldn't seat (at
least that is what I remember).  Hubby had to take the engine out and do
something to the cylinders, re-hone?  It was a BIG hassle. . .

We kept with the oil changes every 2,000-2,500 miles or so.

&gt; Hey,
&gt;         Has anyone had positive experience using Slick 50 or any of the
&gt; other teflon(or non-teflon) treatments in extending their engine's life?
&gt; I'm just about to get a 2.0 L rebuild back on the road and was
&gt; wondering, of course wanting to get the maximum mileage out of her. The
&gt; air-cooleds being such fragile beasts I thought this might be a good
&gt; idea, but have never heard it discussed regarding volksies.
