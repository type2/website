&gt;Your battery is well grounded, but what about the alternator/engine?
&gt;Check the ground strap at the nose of the trans.
Strap check out good.  Took the connections off and wire brushed them any
how though.

&gt;You have voltage at idle, what is it at higher rpm's?
Voltage remains around 12.5...this is around 2500 to 3000 rpm's.

&gt;Does a charge hold overnight?
Does the battery hold a charge while sitting over night?  Yes it does.
Also, this is a new battery as of last week.

Hunting the archives on how to check the voltage regulator.

Thanks for the help...

Troy
