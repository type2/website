Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Utility


&gt;Anyone else like
&gt;to load their bus down?  :-)

Would dragging an 8x10 ft utility trailer around with four engines and one 
transaxle (some Corvair and some VW) count?

How about dragging my Beetle back and forth to Chattanooga (90 miles) over 
two mountains?

How about dragging a Hyundai from Norfolk to Chattanooga with a Type IV 
powered Beetle?

How about dragging a late 80's Bronco II 4WD about 35 miles with a 40 HP 
Beetle?

We've moved several times using this Bus for a moving truck - and with a 
trailer out back.

Have always carried or pulled 1000-1500 lbs with my bus from time to time. 
Shift early, keep the fan spinning at a good rate and what the temp gauges 
on the dash.


Ciao!
