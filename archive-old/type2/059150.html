Hello Listees!

I finally got around to pulling the tranny on Hannah my newly (January)
acquired '72 camper.  While I was at it I decided to pull the tank and get it
cleaned and inspected.  This bus used to have a gas heater in it.  I think it
was an Eberspacher (sp?).  The PO still has the heater but he wanted to sell
it separately.  Anyway, the gas tank cover has the cutout and some sheet metal
parts that go with the heater.  I also have the heater cable and the mechanism
that it attaches to inside the gas tank compartment.  You people with heaters
will know what I'm talking about.  As I have no intention of ever putting a
heater in this bus, I would like to trade my gas tank cover, control cable and
the thing (thingy?) that it attaches to for a regular gas tank cover.  This is
a '72, so any other years that may fit are acceptable trades.  Any takers?  If
someone is seriously interested in the heater, I will talk to the PO and see
what he wants for it.  I think it is fairly complete, but I have no idea what
kind of condition it is in.  Let me know.  If there are no takers I will be
forced to either patch this cover or go to the bone yards and hope to find
one.
