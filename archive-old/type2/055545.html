Stephen and list,
&gt;  Someone correct me if I'm wrong... but THROW OUT what the books say!  A
&gt;  type1 engine is a type1 engine, pretty much the same from year to year.
&gt;  The ONLY reason they list years for timing is to help you identify the
&gt;  dizzy.
&gt;
&gt;  The problem is, more and more, that people don't have the stock dizzy.
&gt;  Once you go 009, it doesn't matter if your engine is a '67 1500 or a '71
&gt;  1600.  Timing is related to the dizzy, nothing special about the case or
&gt;  crank.

Seems like a camshaft would affect the timing, so are you saying that there is
no difference in stock camshafts between all type 1 engines?  I have always
wondered about this, really.
