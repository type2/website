Subject: Re: [T2] Valve Adjustments

&gt;Has anybody noticed how you can HEAR the adjustment? I pull the covers
&gt;off, and move the rockers. ...&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt;... But it was an interesting observation, and might be
&gt;handy in an emergency.

Yes!

It's been twice that I noticed something was wrong with my valves just by 
the sound of them.
The first time I found the adjusting screw of the intake valve on #4 
completely out and resting on the cover.
I had to bike 40 miles to find a replacement at a shop that works on 
aircooled engines south of Boston :-P since
none of the FLAPS or VW dealers around had them.

The second time, one of the washers holding the rocker arm shaft for #1 and 
2 broke and the nut unscrew itself off the stud. Again, I found the nut and 
the broken washer resting on the valve cover
It scares me how much damage could've been caused by a 5 cents part failing...
