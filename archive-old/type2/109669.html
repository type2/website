Subject: Re: [T2] adventurewagen ?'s

&gt; ok, i got the 73 adventurewagen home no i am seeking knowledge from you
&gt; great gurus of the bay busses.  i have several switches that while they may
&gt; be working i can't seem to make them do anything.

&quot;Great gurus&quot;? I like that.... :-)

&gt;  the 2 fans,

What two fans would that those be?

&gt; the camper
&gt; lights and the toggle switch on the dash seem to do nothing.

I have a camper light switch (looks just like the headlight switch but it'
s to the right of the steering wheel). Dunno know what that toggle switch 
might be, I don't have one of those. Have you checked your fuses? Bulbs? (Easy 
stuff first.)

&gt; i do know my
&gt; aux battery is dead as the volt meter on the side of the fridge says so.

I have one of those!

&gt; their is a switch on the upper cabinet that seems to have something to do
&gt; with the propane and i have yet to switch it as i'm really unsure of it's
&gt; function and don't want to screw anything up.  so if one of you could
&gt; please tell me what i'm doing with this then i would be most greatful.

Mine seems to be disconnected. I guess that was some kind of backup cutoff 
switch. I haven't blown myself up yet.

Sorry I couldn't be more help. You have discovered the great mysteries of 
the Adventurewagen.

Nikki
