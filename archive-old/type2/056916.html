Subject: carb trouble?

&gt;the thing is just awfully jerky.

How about trying a stock carb, best if you can just borrow one for the
experiment, ...or perhaps contamination (water etc) in the fuel could be
causing this, assuming that fuel filters, lines and pumps are OK, I've
heard of things in the tank blocking the outlet or even air entering
through a cracked hose. Sounds suspiciously like a fuel blockage, but then
I don't know much about electricals anyway.

Good Luck,
