Subject: Re: Accellerator Pedal Update, Spring Needed &amp; Cabinets to go

I got the pedal off  and found that indeed the one side of the hinge was 
broken.
What poor quality that this stuff falls apart after a mere 28 years :)
So I did as suggested and dug through the hardware cabinet and found a 
loose pin hinge to mate that would work with the pedal hinge. Got it all 
reassembled and tap screwed it to the floor.
Works like a dream!
Thanks for the suggestions.

Now where do I get a replacement spring for this assembly?


Lastly, I have some cabinets, a gas tank and some hardware to get rid of 
in preparation for our move West. I will hopefully get photos this 
weekend and post them for the List to have first crack at them before I 
put them on TheSamba_dot_com. Look for a posting later today or tomorrow. 
Half of any profit will go to Type2_dot_com
