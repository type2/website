Hugh:

Over time the lock mechanisms get clogged up with greasy dirt, debris, dog 
hair, etc.  By carefully prying off the trim panels you can access the lock 
mechanisms.  You can then clean them with a dose of WD-40, some clean rags, 
and perhaps, some compressed air (if needed).  Usually the WD-40 will float 
away the accumulated crud and your locks should function nicely again.  Good 
luck.
