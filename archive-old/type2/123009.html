Subject: Vacuum Readings continued

Well I got the hose clamps and some carb cleaner in the hopes of locating
and sealing a leaking vacuum hose. Before I got all into it with the hose
clamps I thought I would try and locate a leak. I was getting 12-13&quot; of
vacuum at idle when warmed up. I sprayed around every hose and hose
connection, (fire extinguisher in hand) and found no chnage in idle or
vacuum reading. Then I sprayed around the intake mainfolds where they bolt
up to the heads. On the 3/4 side, in fact right over #4 the idle dropped
noticeably when I sprayed. Looks like I need a new gasket there, tried
snugging up the nuts. Any good ideas on where to get a set of intake
manifold gaskets? Im in northern Va and would prefer a VW FLAPS but not
sure if I can find these gaskets without buying the whole engine set.
Perhaps some local listee has 2 they can part with??? I think I can reuse
the plastic spacer block just need the gasket between the manifold and the
block then the block and the head.

As always TIA,
