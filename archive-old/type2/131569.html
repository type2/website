Subject: was Double Relay to fuel Pump, now battery cables/connectors

Thanks I will try that first either way I should have done it when I was in 
there. I have to buy a new ground strap later anyway. The one tha the PO 
installed is RED. Well no come to think of it I wrapped it in electrical 
tape so I wouldn't confuse myself.. Color is okay.

I replaced the battery connector on the positive side of the battery with a 
brass connector. Can anybody think of a problem that this could cause?

&gt;Hi Michael,

&gt;Just clean both sides of the contact area ( body and strap) with a wire 
&gt;brush and reconnect them. A coating of dielectric grease on top of that 
&gt;will help put off further corrosion.

&gt;My own answer to this eternal question was to install a new secondary 
&gt;ground cable from the battery to the fan shroud. For the $8 it cost, it was 
&gt;a 10 minute install.
