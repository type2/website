With all respect Robb, VW designed an engine that would please the average
owner/operator. This is NOT the same individual that is owning/operating the
vehicle today, and THIS is the basis for my comments and opinions.

We agree to disagree on this one Robb

Yea, right. VW spent MILLIONS of dollars on R&amp;D, and you're trying to tell us
that the MILLION or so Type2's that were produced with hyd. lifters were
intentionally intended to die a fiery death after an unnaturally short service
life due to the stock cam causing an overheat condition?!!!!! No offense, but
I, for one, trust VW's R&amp;D Engineers more than ANY aftermarket
builder/vendor.
