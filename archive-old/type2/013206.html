About mounting a wench.

Wenches are a popular item to get stolen. I've lost many of them over the
last thirty years.

I'd put some type of quick disconnect on each end of the vehicle.
Something that would mount the winch with two spring pins or such. I'd
just use long jumper type cables to hook directly to the battery. And a
long control cable for the run and reverse function.

If you feel you need a winch you may need a 4 wheel drive. Winches are
handy for helping your friends when they get into trouble. That's about
all I ever used bumper mounted winches for. Had one that was switchable
from front to rear on a Toyota land cruiser back when they were war
machines.

I've used winches mostly on gin poles to handle large lifting loads.
