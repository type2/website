I've just fitted a new flywheel oil seal so there's no longer an 
embarrassing oil puddle left under the bus.

How does that pollution compare with what comes out of the exhaust?

Now I come to think of it, what's the pollution cost of those fancy metals 
in engine management systems when the vehicles end up in the scrap yard?

And while I'm banging a small drum, what's the pollution cost associated 
with the manufacture of  a new vehicle?
