&gt; This is a bad design for a trailer hitch!!  Don't use this type.  The
&gt; weight of the trailer tongue is held up only by the bumper and the forward
&gt; and back forces press and pull against the engine cross member which then
&gt; pushes/pulls against the front tranny mount.  Terrible engineering.
&gt; 
&gt; The best hitch is the one that mounts on both sides of the rear frame where
&gt; the bumper mounts then has it's own round cross member that is hidden
&gt; behind the bumper.  The bumper does not hold anything and could even fall
&gt; off with no affect to the hitch!!  Also any forward or backward pulling
&gt; forces are directed straight to the frame which is much stronger than the
&gt; early busses.  This hitch does not impare getting to muffler, or changing
&gt; oil.  This is a well thought out design.

See, that's what I began to think after looking at 'em, that the most
obvious place was right there with the bumper mounts.  Kragen had
something that was totally wrong, too, NEVER would work.  What crap.

This pic is from Dalan - which folks on the list said was best.

Anyone got a line on a hitch such as Rick describes?  Can anyone fab
these for us?

I haven't seen any hitches meeting Rick's description in about 3 months
of looking...
