Subject: almost free 1980 vanagon

My 1980 vanagon westfalia 
(http://wrybread_dot_com/WryRoad/mecasa/vanglorious1.htm) is at the end of its 
life, for me at least.  She was in that stage where there was repair after 
repair, and now she needs tranny rebuilt (no reverse), so I decided to 
retire her.

I'm taking most of the camper stuff out to build into my &quot;new&quot; 1973 dodge 
van (don't hate me), but when I'm done I'm sure there will be lots of stuff 
left.  I plan to take the stove/sink/fridge assembly as well as possibly the 
bed/bench and probably the tables, but that still leaves a lot.

The pop top canvas is pretty much shot, but other than that everythnign's in 
good shape, including the engine.

I'm in the San Francisco area, the van is currently parked near Stamford 
University.

Anyone interested? Does $100 seem fair?
