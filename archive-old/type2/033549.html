&gt;  First, they do have a web-site: www.beardseats_dot_com
&gt;  Also, I am only speculating that this will be a pretty strait forward
&gt;  installation, my bus is at the restoration shop and itll be quite some
&gt;  time before Im going to be able to acually fit them in.  I will go out
&gt;  and use the old 72 to see how exactly theyll fit, but from the looks
&gt;  of the mounting hardware it doesnt seem like much more then simply 
&gt;  drilling some holes and bolting them in.

I would suspect that it will be MUCH more involved than this.

Bus seats are extremely upright in position, i/e you sit pretty much
straight up in the seat with your feet flat on the floor.  If beard made
you special seats with this in mind you should be okay... but if they
didnt...

The way they are constructed, from what i have been able to tell, is
similar to a fiberglass racing seat.  i/e they are not adjustable for the
tilt of the backrest.  If this is the case, on a 68-77 bus there is a wall
behind the drivers and passengers seat that supports teh backrest of the
seat.  Usually this backrest is practically paralell to the wall that
supports it... there isnt much room for rake or extra padding.  On a seat
that goes in a sports car etc. there is oten some rake to the backrest so
one can recline and avaoid hitting ones head on the roof... is the beard
seat that way? 

If this is the case, the rigid and unadjustable backrest will force you to
mount the seat so that your legs are way too far forward.  The solution to
this is to drive all cramped up or hack out the partitions behind the
drivers and passenger seats and move the seats back... which in a westy
will interfere with teh cabinets behind the driver and passenger seat.

(all aftermarket seats i have seen in an unhacked bus have an adjustable
backrest, never have seen anyone put in fixed backrest seats without
hacking the divider....)

but then you are laying back as if you were in a bug when you really want
to be sitting upright.  It might be hard to reach the wheel or see over
the dash.

Finally, seats designed for a regular car instead of a van often have a
slope from the back of the seat upwards so that the front edge of the seat
is quite a bit higher than the rear.  In a bus where you are designed to
sit upright with your feet flat on teh floor, rather than slightly
reclined with your feet out in front of you, such a design can cut off the
circulation to your feet if the ridge digs into your legs.  I have no idea
if the beard seat is this way or not.

I am just guessing as to this particular installation based on the hacks i
have seen in older busses, and my general knowledge of the difference
between auto seat and bus seat design...  My knowledge could be way of.
Please pipe up all and lets get a debate going :)

I would suggest measuring the current seats in the bus, and comparing
those measurements to the seats you have ordered.... i may be WAY off (i
often am, heheh)

peas,

Steve
