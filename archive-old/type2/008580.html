Hey Y'all,
  I have a set of PDSIT carbs for sale from a 73 bus. They are complete
and still installed on the bus. They were just rebuilt and never run. So
they are real clean and ready to go. I will include all linkage, air
cleaner, manifolds, crossover tube, and an extra set of manifolds from a
72. Basicly the complete carburation set-up. I am asking $150 for it
all. I will ship if you pay the shipping, probably about $25. 
  I am also toying with the idea of selling my 1970 Bus. Its a 7
passenger bus with the Sunroof, but I pulled the sunroof off and
installed a '70 Westy pop top. It has a Z-bed, not a westy bed, and no
other Westy stuff. So It still seats 7 and can also be used as a camper.
It has a 1600dp with Alternator convertion, heater assist blower, and
has a dog house oil cooler(from a 71). The engine has about 30k miles
and just passed Washington state emissions test. It is overall in good
condition but needs paint. The only rust is by the battery. I use it as
my daily driver, so it is a runner and it all works. I will entertain
offers.
