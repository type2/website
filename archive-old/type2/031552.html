&gt; We have a puzzler. One of the rockers, #1 exhaust, is &quot;buried&quot; down into the 
&gt; valve spring upper washer. With the lifter on the base circle, you can see 
&gt; none of the head of the adjuster screw below the end of the rocker.

had this problem, one of the valves ate its way into the valve seat,
essentially grinding it's way through.  either that or the valve seat
itself is sinking into the head.

take off the rockers, are the tops of the valves even??

if not, pull the head
