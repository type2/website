Subject: Engine Reccomendations - Old one seized !

I'm not having a lot of luck with my Type 2 1971 Van.

After purchasing it and spending £600 on the braking system, the engine has
now seized on me !

Engine that has seized - Volkspares Gold engine, supposedly with Unleaded
heads.

The garage has basically said that it is cheaper to get a Rec-con engine as
opposed to trying to repair the old engine.

Ok, here's where you wonderful people can help.

If I'm going to spend most of my time on the Motorway, what would be the
best replacement engine ?

I thought to go for the biggest i.e 2.0l but the garage has said that
anything with twin carbs is going to require a lot of tuning.

What experiance have you guys had ?

What reccomendation have you guys got ?

Is cruising at 75-80 mph an unrealistic goal for my Van ? If so what speed
does every one else go at ? Is this foot to the floor ? :-&gt;

Thanks in Advance

Ian.
