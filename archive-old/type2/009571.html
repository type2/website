Subject: Re: CDI ignition on a FI bus???

As I recall (correct me if I'm wrong)...., the triggering contacts are only
required in early FI, as in the type 3 vehicles.  I got a distributor from
a listee with the ?Pertronics pointless ignition and it worked fine for
him.  The later FI (ie, busses) uses its triggering from the condensor wire
(that extra black wire to the coil)......MB
