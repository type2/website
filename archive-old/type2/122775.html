Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon power outage Solved

Hi Volks,

Dad's back under way again... My first guess turned out to be correct: 
a bad ground. He ran a set of jumper cables from the body of the 
starter to the negative terminal of the battery and the interior lights 
on the bus lit up immediately. The engine then started with no problems 
and he is now en-route to a flaps to acquire a new ground cable.

He says the engine is running much smoother than it has in a while... 
He had been complaining of a low-speed stumble, but he says that seems 
to be cured as well.

Happy trails indeed, and a BIG THANKS to those who responded.

&gt;&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My dad's out right now in his 81 Vanagon, and he has lost all
&gt;&gt; electrical power. The lights, horn, and engine are all dead. He's on a
&gt;&gt; client site and it was fine when he got there but won't go at all at
&gt;&gt; the moment.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; He has 2 batteries aboard, and both are well charged with clean
&gt;&gt; connections and lots of available juice.
&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt;&gt;
