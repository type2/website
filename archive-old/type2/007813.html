Subject: Vacuum Lines
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I just rebuilt the 2.0L fuel injected motor in my 78 bus.  The engines in (for a week now) but I can't remember where how the vacuum lines were routed.  The pictures of the motor before disassembly didn't come out.  Please help!  I need to drive my bus.
