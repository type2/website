Look at the little ground strap inside the dizzy. make sure
it isnt fatigued. I had a problem very much like that and
it that is what I finally found  to be the cause.
&gt; 
&gt; For the last couple of months I have intermittently been
&gt; experiencing a
&gt; power loss accompanied by black smoke from the tail pipe.
&gt;  (not great
&gt; billowing clouds but enough to be visible in the side
&gt; mirror if you look
&gt; closely). This is gradually getting worse.
