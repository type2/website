&gt;Hiya Dan,
&gt;
&gt;I've seen this happen a few times now - once to me - 
&gt;that's when I learned to check the play in the front end bearings regularly.
&gt;  
&gt;
Can you elaborate on how to 'check the play' in the front end bearings?  
Is it described in bentleys or muirs?  I took both wheels off, and 
visually inspected things.  Not that I know what I'm looking for, but 
everything looked as I believe it should..
