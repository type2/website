Subject: fridge wireing

Been reading the thread on refrigerators and thought I would ask if
anyone knows about the wiring of the fridge. I have a 75 bus ( not a
westy), when I purchased it the P.O. threw in a Dometic 45cew fridge
that he picked up at a bone yard. Said he thought about installing it
but never got around to it. I am thinking about converting the bus to a
day camper and installing the fridge.

The problem is the wiring behind the fridge is all cut out! There is a
little wiring diagram sticker on the back but it indicates that there
are four wires coming out of the heating element. Two for the d.c.
heater coil and 2 for the a.c. heater coil. The problem is in reality
the heating element has three wires coming out of it. One wires
insulation  is all white, another has one red band at the end, and the
other has two red bands at the end of the wire. Is this a heating
element from a d.c. only fridge? Does this element actually have a d.c.
and an a.c. heating coil but use a common return from both coils?

I have checked the archives and found nothing pertaining to the heating
elements, but I did find info containing the 800 number for Dometic.
When i called them they said they had no info in this fridge because it
is too old. I tried to explain the heating element problem but they said
to take it to an authorized dealer. No help there. OH WELL.

I work in electronics every day so I'm sure with a little info from
someone out there I can get this thing wired up and get it working. If
anyone has one of these fridges removed from there bus could you please
check out haw many wires are coming out of your heating element and how
they are connected to the a.c./d.c. switch. I really appreciate any help
you can give on this. I would really like to chill out (my grub) while I
travel.

Thanks and happy hiways to you all.
