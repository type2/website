Greetings to all of you near Flint, MI
   Next weekend my wife and I will be taking our son to college in Flint.  
We will have Sunday July 11th free and are wondering if any of you listees 
&gt;from that area would like to get together for a while.  We have 20+ years of 
buses under our belts and currently have a 71 Westy.  It would be great to 
meet a listee from that area and have a face to put with a name that comes 
by on the list.
   If your interested drop us a line before July 8th.
      Paul A.
      Huntington Station, New York
