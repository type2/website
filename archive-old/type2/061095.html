&gt; Ok,  I just finished a tuneup on my 68 westy.  It had sat for two
&gt; years,
&gt; I drove it home and did the follwing:
&gt;
&gt; New fuel filter, fuel line, cleaned air cleaner, changed oil, new
&gt; Bosch
&gt; platinum plugs, wires, cap, generator belt, and fresh air hoses.

Did you set the timing?

&gt; I installed a rotor from my FLAPS, and the engine would not start.  So
&gt; i
&gt; put the old one in and it was fine.
&gt;

Kinda weird... Maybe they gave you the wrong rotor. Dizzy may have been
changed out by a PO. Best to order parts for a distributor by the dizzy
part number rather than by the model and year of your van.

&gt; So, my question---
&gt;
&gt; After  my  &quot;tune-up&quot; i drove the bus.  It had a tremendous power
&gt; increase!!!  But, it starts to hesitate and sputter at high rev.  Also
&gt;
&gt; the idle RPM has seemed to increase.  Did I do something wrong? Are my
&gt;
&gt; valves too tight. does my crab need adjusting.  Or is everything fine,
&gt;
&gt; and its just the RPM cutoff in the rotor???  Im new please help!

Sounds like the timing is roo far advanced.Check your book, and be
advised that someone may have changed the crankshaft pulley (the part
with the timing mark on it) at one time or another, causing an error in
reading the timing.

&gt; Question #2.  My engine is leeking oil? how can I stop this?  Thanks!!

Way too many possibilities to list here. Admin would be upset with the
bandwidth. Clean 'er up as best you can (at a car wash that is capeable
of accepting the resulting polluting runoff, of course) and look for
leaks.

Good luck!
