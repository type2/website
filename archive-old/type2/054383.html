Subject: RE: Is this *BAD* customer service or what?

I would agree with David K, German and Swedish are the dog's wotsits.  Their
parts are generally better quality or the same as JK but cheaper, even after
JK have discounted 10%.  Service is very good as well, the only downside is
that they don't have such a wide range as they cover all the other VWs as
well (plus Saab, BMW, etc).  Having said that, they carry some parts that JK
don't.  Give them a call, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
Another company that is good to deal with is VW Heritage.
To be fair to JK, I have always found them to be helpful and even when they
send the wrong parts they don't have a problem with me returning them,
though they have yet to refund any of my shipping costs.
