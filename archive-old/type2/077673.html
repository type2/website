Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Valves

Chris Mills sends:

&gt; I've been looking for said &quot;automatic&quot; valve that would open when the
&gt; ignition was turned on but have so far been unable to find it.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm still looking.
&gt; 
&gt; Would be a great safety item in case of fire - would keep fuel from beeing
&gt; added to the fire and would require no effort to close - I'm certainly not
&gt; going to lean under my bus to turn a valve!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe a brass valve with a choke cable added to the lever...

Maybe a solenoid to actuate the handle on a ball valve?
