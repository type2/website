&gt; I figured maybe they were permanent studs..So then I tried putting everything

All six should be studs, and they can be a bit hard to reinstall.  Keep
at it and push the plate upward while you screw the acorn nut on.

You might have to back the stud out a bit to allow it to extend far enough
to get the nut on.  Don't get carried away with this!
