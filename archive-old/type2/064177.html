Subject: Re: smelly leaky brakes

as the goo smells like gear oil, it sounds like the reduction gear box seal.
 A seal kit costs ~$5 and wouldn't take more than an afternoon to replace.
 The drum needs to come off, and all the brakes - shoes and cylinder.   A
good time to replace the hose if it is cracked, and any brake bit that are
not good.   pry the dust cap of the cylinder up, if its wet in there, it is
bad.    then drain the reduction gear box oil, and remove the cover plate by
undoing the 4 15mm bolts.    Take out the old seals and replace with the new
seals and gaskets.   make sure it is all clean.   have plenty of rags handy.
  before putting the rim on, and after putting the drum on, refill the box
with gear oil.    if it was dirty, drain the trans and other side and refill
them too.

hope this helps

Clara
