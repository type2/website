  Re Jake Vincent's to-be-painted bus:&quot;i'm gonna do it white over red, and
i'm wondreing if anybody knows the name/ model number of the red and white
that was originally on busses...&quot;

I have original red &amp; white 75 bus- but the numbers are missing on sticker-
it says KANSANROT
        PASTELLWEISS  on it- hope that helps!
