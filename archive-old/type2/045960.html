Subject: [T2] Auxilliary air regulator

Hi all
I am trying to get the auxilliary air regulator to work in my 78 westy.
There is no voltage at the connector.  From the diagram it appears that it
takes its current from pin 35 in the ECU.  It flows through the AAR, then to
groung through terminal 88c of the double relay.

My question is:  Does pin 35 simply supply 12 v all the time, or is it a
timed thing done inside the ECU?

I believe my harness has a short in this wire.  If all 35 does is supply
12v, can I wire 12v from the coil to the AAR, instead?

Thanks!!
