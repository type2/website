Subject: Re: [T2] Heating with water - seeking what-if-ideas

--=====================_58376016==_.ALT

Please when you get a chance - I would love to see the info!

I'm thinking stainless steel casings around OEM heat sinks and pipes 
(properly coated with a paint to slow any rusting) and this would eliminate 
any chance of exhaust fumes in the interior. When the OEM pipes and sinks 
rust out (but shouldn't be fast with a proper anitfreeze) you just dig out 
another set of rusted heater boxes, cut off the shell, move the watercooled 
shells from your old pipes to your &quot;new&quot; pipes.

Should be several years per set or more.

But how to pump the water around without a bunch of pulleys....

&gt;I have a 1958 Berkeley which is a fiberglass bodied car powered by an

&gt;showing a rig to heat a Berk with a water system, the water heated by the 
&gt;exhaust.  If you are interested, send me your address and I will hunt it 
&gt;up and make a copy for you.  If it worked in a Berkeley it ought to work 
&gt;in a VW.  I had forgotten all about the old rig until you asked.
