Mike,

Work the connection pieces of the exhaust that are out of shape first.  Use 
body tools (hammer and dolly), heat from a torch, files etc. Check it with a 
metal straight edge.  When you have a flat sealing surface you KNOW the 
gaskets can then do their job.

Its also a good idea to check the manifold to head connections of the 
manifold/heaterbox for trueness.  They often warp.  Use a straightedge across 
both flanges.  If they are not true across, get a flat file large enough to 
file across both of them at the same time and work them until you have a 
true, clean sealing surface. 

Extra gaskets will only ensure that you will have to tear it all apart and do 
it right the NEXT time.  : )
