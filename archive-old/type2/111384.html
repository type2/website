Subject: Re: [T2] Paint Removal

try wal mart they have a paint stripper there that works really well with a putty knife.....(it is a white can with gold on it cant remember name of it betwen 3-5 bucks a can..

i myself am doing this right now..

that and a water hose is all i been useing and almost have it down to factory primer to be wet sanded...
sure saves alot of sand paper just what ever you do dont get that stuff on your skin burns like hell..

&gt;Never having attempted this before, I am trying to
&gt;remove the exterior (multi-colored) paint off a '79

&gt;stripper and now using a vibrating sander with 80 grit
&gt;paper, again a slow procedure.  Now is there an eaiser
&gt;DIY way or must I accept the spray/scrape/sand/curse
