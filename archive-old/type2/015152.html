Subject: Riviera parts stash FS!
Mime-Version: 1.0

I ran across a very nice guy named Charlie who lives on Long Island in NYC.
A while back, he &quot;rescued&quot; a variety of what sounds like a 1979 Riviera 
(&quot;RIVA&quot;on the metal plate).  He said he'd take $350 or so for the following
stash of parts and prefers someone to pick it all up in one shot, if possible:

Donor Vehicle:  1979 Mexico Beige VW Riviera (?) conversion camper

091 Transmission with new clutch aboard
Overhead AC unit
Both front doors
Sliding glass side (middle) windows
4 aluminum wheels (about 30 &quot;spokes&quot; by Charlie's description no center
caps). Wheels have dry-rotted tires on them. 
Interior cloth and headliner
No cabinets
rear defrosting glass

The headliner and vinyl panels are tan in color. I probably forgot a couple
of other things he has. PLEASE DON'T CONTACT ME, CALL CHARLIE DEBONO BETWEEN
7-9 AM (Eastern Time) at:

            516-842-1844

I have not seen any of these parts so caveat emptor and good hunting!
