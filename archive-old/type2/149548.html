Subject: RE: [T2] Help with timing 77 westy

Lee, when you say nothing happens, does the engine turn over? Does it click? 
Is there any sound at all?

If not, check all your battery connections and make sure they're clean. Then 
try again. If nothing still, double check your points. Take the distributor 
out of the engine to do your points (don't worry, it can only go back in one 
way). There's a nut that holds it to a bolt sticking out of the block on the 
right side.

Try making a static timing light by using your bulb from your overhead 
light. Tie a wire to either side and hook it up to your coil like you've 
been doing with your volt meter. When you turn the distrubutor, the light 
will come on when contact is made. It's an easy way to tell if things are 
turning correctly inside the distributor, especially if you aren't sure 
about what to look for using a voltmeter. Basically, when you use the volt 
meter the way you described, you're static timing. Making the little light 
is just a simple visual.

Good Luck!
