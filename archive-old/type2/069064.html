Hi Joel!
  Your responses are as quick and reliable as ever...here's some more 
info:
&gt; since it is a potentiometer, i would expect the values to vary according
&gt; to the opening of the air vane. if you get a steady 300 ohms, move the
&gt; air flap and see if the value changes smoothly ... or jumps suddenly to
&gt; zero ohms.
I moved the air flap and it didn't have any influence on the 
resistance between connectors 6 and 9: I get a steady 313 Ohms no 
matter how the potentiometer is positioned. So I guess we agree that 
this thing's broken???
&gt; according to the Bosch Fuel Injection &amp; Engine Management book:
&gt; &quot;on some early models, the opening of the air vane closes a contact
&gt; and signals the fuel pump to operate.
Yeah, that contact works okay. You only have to open the flap a 
couple of mm or so, and it closes the contact. So that's okay...
  The other thing I found since my last post is that temp. sensor 2 
(the one near cylinder 3 air intake) has a resistance lower than 
specs at 20 degrees C. So it looks like the possibilities are rapidly 
getting endless. And then there's the possibility of vacuum leaks...I 
replaced all the 5mm reinforced hoses, but there's also those bigger 
ones that I haven't dealt with yet...
  I guess I'll call it a day...
Thanx again,
                          Gregor
