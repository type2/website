You may have a slave cylinder that's dying, or perhaps a bad seal in the
clutch master cylinder.  Check for a hydraulic fluid leak under the bus
where the slave cylinder lives.

When you start up in the morning after the bus has sat for a while, try
pumping the clutch pedal a few times before engaging a gear.  If that makes
a difference, the problem is definitely in the clutch's hydraulic system.

In that case, keep the fluid topped up, watch for leaks, remember to pump
the pedal before shifting, and plan for an overhaul of the clutch hydraulics
ASAP...

&gt;&gt;  I have been having difficulty in the mornings of
shifting my 1982 aircooled vanagon into first gear.  I
have the bad habit of starting it up in first and
moving to neutral and then back into first.  Sometimes
on those mornings when it refuses to go into first , I
have to shut it off and push it into gear again.
I have also noticed that when I leave from work and
put it into reverse it has a tendency  to &quot;clunk&quot; into
gear.  This never happens in the forward gears, only
reverse after it has been sitting.  I know this
vehicle has a hydraulic clutch and depends on the
brake fluid.  The resevoir is topped off.
It seems as though the vehicle doesn't like to sit for
long, because once moving it shifts fine.
I know the easy answer is to quit going to work but
failing that any suggestions?  &lt;&lt;
