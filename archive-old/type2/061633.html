Ken et al,

&gt;If we're not able to find another situation with donated bandwidth, we're
&gt;going to have to do some FUNDRAISING around here, people, so get ready for
&gt;a pledge drive. Unless we're able to nail down a feed by mid-week, we'll be
&gt;having a bus-a-thon until we get a years' worth of bandwidth in the bank.

OK, I'll put up $25.00.
