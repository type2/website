&gt;  The frequent debate:  FI &amp; Electronic Ignition versus
&gt; Carbs and Points.
&gt; 
&gt; That debate is solved in my state.  If your car is 75
&gt; or newer, it can't be EMISSIONS modified and still
&gt; pass the emissions tests.  Unless of course they don't
&gt; look carefully during the inspections every other
&gt; year.  :D

&gt; 
&gt; Not sure where you live, but if it is in California, it is 100% LEGAL to
&gt; upgrade to electronic ignition. The
&gt; only drawback with using the 79 Cal electronic set-up is having to connect the
&gt; retard side of the vacuum unit.
&gt; The correct way is to use the 79 throttle housing because it has a dedicated
&gt; port for retard.

You could also use a late bus single vacuum advance canister on the CA
distributor - remove the CA dual can and swap an advance only can onto the
distributor. You need to verify your total advance and so forth after doing
this sort of swap. I've done similar swaps a few times and I usually try a
few vacuum canisters until I am happy with the amount of vacuum advance the
distributor is making.
