16.4 is a little low for a 78 but not too far out of line depending on the
type of driving.

my 78 gets between 16-18 around town once in a  while I get close to 20MPG
but remember these are HEAVY vehicles 

the fuel injection is usually the last place to look when there are
problems.  check your idle adjust screw on the throttle body.  that has a
big effect on fuel mileage...
