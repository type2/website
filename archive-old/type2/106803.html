Subject: RE: [T2] Air Conditioning???

&gt;I don't see why not - home A/C units use copper pipe.  It would have to be 
&gt;very vibration-proof though.

We did this on 3 different a/c systems transplanted into street rods. 
Worked well for many years with no problems. I would not run them through 
the passenger compartment though in case it ruptured.
