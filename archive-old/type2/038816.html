rich,
if its a 1600 upright engine, you should be able to
find a good running used one for a couple hundred
bucks or rebuild the one you have.   the upright
motors are super common, im sure others will email you
some specifics on where to start your search, but the
internet is a great place to start of course.   we all
feel your pain:(

73 riviera camper &quot;lizzy&quot;(taking a moment of silence
for her fallen compadre)


Now I have a great
&gt; camper that is sitting in the shop...
&gt; 
&gt; How much should I expect to pay for a replacement
&gt; for
&gt; a 71 westy?  I have no idea, just don't want to get
&gt; ripped off.  Thanks for any assistance you can give
&gt; me.  &quot;sniff&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely, 
&gt; 
&gt; Brokenhearted
