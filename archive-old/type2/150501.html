&amp;gt; Exactly what do you have to do to the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; vehicle recipe to get

Black Magic.  It takes a certain amount of energy to push a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;
vehicle through the air.  There is a certain thermodynamic efficiency
possible from an IC engine.  There is a certain amount of energy available
from buring HC fuels.

None of these are easily changable.  You might get incremental change, but
nothing like getting 5 times the mileage out of a Ford Extravagance.

Now, you can do things like fool the EPA test cycle to make it look like
you're getting spectacular mileage.  Toyota Prius owners are mighty
disappointed to find that they really don't get 60MPG in the city.  The
number is more like 45 (still not too bad, IMO)

What happened is that EPA mileage numbers are calculated based upon the
exhaust emissions from the car.  This is accurate as long as the engine is
the exclusive source of motive power for the car, but in the Prius it
isn't.  The motive power provided by the electric motor is not reflected
in the exhaust emissions as it is being expended, but does cause
increased emissions later on when the excess power of the engine is used
to recharge the batteries.  If the recharge occurs outside of the EPA
cycle it inflates the mileage numbers markedly.

Some would call this &amp;quot;gaming the system&amp;quot; on Toyota's part, while some
would say that the fault is in the EPA cycle.  The truth lies somewhere
between.

I'm still a great believer in &amp;quot;miles per vehicle&amp;quot;.  My bus is still pretty
hard to beat on that measure!
