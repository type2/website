&gt;
&gt; 68-70, the warm air flap is cable controlled from the right flap.
&gt;
&gt; 71 is one-year-only, the warm air flap is thermostatically controlled.

Karl
would this be a problem in practicality?
being in miami of course i have no heat, no heater boxes (except the ones
I have in the carport), and no preheat or warm air hoses attached at all.

Physically is it the same save the flap control?

thanks.
