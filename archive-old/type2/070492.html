Subject: New Ga emission tests

I finally got hold of a group today billed as &quot; the  Georgia Clean Air
Commission&quot; to get some info on the upcomming emission standards. I'm not
sure if this group is EPA or state or what but just the pretty name and 800
number tells me that they are gearing up  for an expected onslaught when
people realize what's happening. They are mailing me the info but gave me a
few details by phone.

The new testing begins this Oct and will be done every other year rather than
annually as is the case now. Presently 5 counties in the Atlanta area are
covered but that is being expanded to 13 counties. Vehicles from 1975 are
included. Previously vehicles were excluded after 10 years of age so that was
always something to look forward to. the clerk said that the older cars would
be subject to a &quot;load test&quot; whatever that means as well as a &quot;visual
inspection&quot; for a converter. Cars failing in 1997 can be required to spend
$200, $450 in later years for repairs. She didn't say wether or not you can
actually be forced off the road. I trust there will be more useful details in
her mailing.

My first response was call the title folks and tell them that they screwed up
on the registration and that I actually have a 4 cyl &quot;diesel&quot; not a gas
motor(diesels are exempt).I don't think she bought it; a supervisor is
supposed to call me.

She didn't mention egr gear specifically, just the converter but I would
think based on what others are reporting from Ca. et al that all of the gear
is probably included. I have an egr valve just none of the rest. Any reason
why the plumbing and filter etc couldn't be homemade if need be?

My understanding of the Vanagon emission gear (crossover pipe etc) is that it
is made of &quot;non-obtainium&quot; regardless of price. Given that this only has to
be done every other year, I think it would be a marvelous business
opportunity for some vanagon type in posession with good equipment to &quot;lease&quot;
it for the tests.

Or maybe I 'll just do like other scofflaws and find another address in the
mountains to register it to. Police just love those little inconsistencies
with your driver's license.

Oh well, we'll see..
