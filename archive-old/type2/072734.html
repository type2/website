Why would you want to drop the tranny just to take the engine out?


Undo 4 bolts on the bellhousing to engine and another 4 bolts on the
carrier ( as well as disconnect a few wires and a piece of tin) and that
suckers is out of there.  A 20 minute job at most.

Why would you want to go through undoing the CV joints, linkage etc, to
pull the tranny just to get the engine out.  I don't understand.

Have fun
