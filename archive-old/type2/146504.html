Subject: running great. but why?

hello again,
       goethe, the two tone bullet, is suddenly running wonderfully.
after the new afm was put in and then two days later she ran rough
again i decided to take some matters into my own hands.  i changed out
the plugs, changed a vacuum line and leaned out the mixture.  she
fired up and ran well although when first started she idled low but
when warmed up just fine.  oh yeah, i also checked and pushed in the
double relay plug connectors and the series resistance block to make
sure they were tight.  then tonight i moved the timing back up to 20
btdc.  sounds and is way wrong but the bus runs well here.
        one new question.  there is a rattling noise on the passenger
side front.  when i hit some bumps the bus starts to shake until i
slow down some then it goes away.  is it the shock?
        thanks to everyone who responded to my previous questions,
queries and quandaries.  i will be checking the fuel filter and tank
soon.


jeremiah and goethe, the two tone bullet
