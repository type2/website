Well, it so happens that my father is in the business of making engraved
plastic badges.  In reasonable quantities, they can be had for about $5
each with name, club name, and even a simple logo, all engraved into the
2-color plastic of your choice.

They pin securely to your clothing, last just about forever, and don't
smear or get soggy when you get them wet.

The business and ham radio people love 'em, but the they don't seem to
have caught on with bus folk.

If there is interest, I'll look into it further.
