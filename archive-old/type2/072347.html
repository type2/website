Subject: Friday: a small problem &amp; question

Hi!

I saved this for Friday since it's not urgent (I think); when I shift 
my '78 Westy into reverse, it works just fine &amp; goes into reverse, 
but when I take my hand off the shift lever it 'pops' out of the 
'pushdown' I guess...  But, it stays in gear.  Anyway, it makes a 
decided pop.  What is out of adjustment?

Also, I have several extra rims I got when I had to replace my 
damaged ones; they're salvage &amp; have badly weathered (useless) tires 
on them; I was wondering if there's a way to take the tires off 
myself, so I can store the rims out of the way somewhere?
