Hello List &amp; Reed Family
	My fl(VW)ap has studs that are 9mm on one end and 8mm on the other. Kinda
spendy, I'm glad I don't really need them...it's a long story.
D&amp;G Foreign Auto Parts in Johnson City, TN 423-854-0093. I'm new to VW and
these guys have been great but I knew I should have slipped that stud in my
pocket.
												Rob, '73 Westy soon to have heat!
													  '76 TR6
