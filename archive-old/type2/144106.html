Subject: source for oil sump plate

 This story pertains to my 1800 1974 dual carb bonestock Bus motor:
 
OK, I need help. I thought I was gonna be cool and try to &quot;machine&quot; my oil sump cover (you know the one, the round one with the bump in the middle) to accept the VDO oil temp sender.
 
Unfortunately, a hand drill and a vise just isn't as accurate as a drill press (which I don't own), so my hole for the sender is kinda &quot;wallowed out&quot; and it doesn't quite make a good, &quot;machine seal&quot; , consequently dripping oil. I made a foolish effort at smearing some gasket sealer around the outside of the sender. You get the picture.
 
Anyway, I haven't pursued getting the fabled Porsch plate, because $70 or more is a bit pricey for me right now. But I can't find any of the OE sump plates, either. Some catalogs have them pictured, but say the are NLA. Where can I get one? Help!
