I believe I've solved my problem.  I'd like to hear some opinions though, to
make sure.  I went through  the FI trouble shooting in the Bentley.  I was
checking out the intake air sensor.  I connected my ohmeter to terminals 36 &amp;
39, and operated the flap by hand.  I was getting zero ohms wether the flap
was opened or closed.  In other words the sensor was not recognizing when the
flap was closed and therefore keeping the fuel pump on all the time.  If you
take the top off there is the little wiper arm that slides across the track.
When the flap is closed (engine off) this arm comes to rest against a little
copper bar, that apparently moves a contact and opens the circuit, thereby
shutting off the fuel pump. On mine, the wiper arm wasn't pushing enough on
this copper piece and the circuit was not opening.  Moving it a fraction of an
inch by hand did the trick.  I just put the slightest bend in the copper part.
Now when I have the key on there is no fuel pump, when I turn it to start, it
fires right up and runs fine.   About two weeks ago (just before the start of
the current run of problems), my neighbor had just bought a new air
compressor, and was itching to use it on something.  So we hooked up the air
gun and cleaned up the engine compartment. While we were doing this, the top
to the air flow meter flew off, so it's possible that this could have messed
things up.

So, I hope that this makes any sense at all.  If not let me know and I'll try
to explain it better.  And I hope someone can tell me if I am accurate in my
assessment.
