Subject: Re: [T2] Bus runs, well kinda

Jules,

The three year old gas has *got* to go first!

In this order:

Drain old gas out of the tank.
Replace *all* rubber fuel line hoses.

Replace or install a new fuel filter.

Fill with new gas....*then* fire it up again and see how it does.

Personally, I would then get the ignition system up to par before I 
touched the carb.(points/plugs/etc.)
Adjust valves...yes, you will haveto do this again after installing the 
new push rod tubes, but this is just a test to make sure it runs ok before 
the new push rod tubes.

Make it run, make it run right, make it run fast&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; For the first time since I''ve owned my '71 westy I've got her to run.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to everyone who helped me get the 34PICT3 to fit the 1600DP
&gt; with an alternator.
&gt; 
&gt; So I started her up for the first time in over 3 years. This was a few
&gt; days ago when the temps were still in the upper 40's here in upstate
&gt; NY. She idled a little rough with a pop and a sputter here and there.
&gt; She also blew quite a bit of white smoke out the tailpipe for the
&gt; first few minutes, along with some small pieces of rust, most likely
&gt; from the rusting exhaust.
&gt; 
&gt; I finally found reverse and decided I'd take her out for a test drive
&gt; around my office parking lot where i've been working on her. Got her
&gt; to one end of the parking lot with no problems, then on the return
&gt; trip I noticed that as I would apply the gas and release the clutch
&gt; that there was some hesitation, then loss of power, then stalling. So
&gt; I rolled her back into here parking spot and started wondering.
&gt; 
&gt; I figure I've got to do the following before my next voyage:
&gt; 
&gt; Replace leaking pushrod tubes
&gt; Adjust valves
&gt; Adjust points/timing
&gt; Tune Carb
snipped&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for any tips or suggestions
&gt; peace
