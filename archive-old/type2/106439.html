&gt; &gt; unfortunately there appears to be a practical maximum amount of air that

&gt; &gt; 55-60mph for a stock setup.

&gt; I dont think the size of the duct openings is the limiting factor.

it isn't the duct openings per se but rather the friction of the air
flowing thru the entire cooling path you need a more powerfull fan to push
more air than the fans rated max flow.

&gt; With a T4 engine since the fan is bolted to the crank you have fixed air
&gt; for any rpm. Im sure you could graph the parameters which would show why
&gt; 55-60 seems to be optimum.

sure, and if I knew all of the heat/cooling airflow characteristics I
could..but the seat of the pants guage and oil temp is all I to go on but
with enough observations a pattern can be determined

&gt; With a T1 you can tweak the airflow by making small changes in the pulley
&gt; ratio which is cool. (literally) :)

but there is still the ability of the duct to handle additional air, this
changing of the pulley probably has the most effect at lower rpm and
diminishes as the rpm goes up, this may be a good thing depending on your
driving habits.
