Well, after a year of mildewing in the garage at my old house and rusting in
the driveway of my new home, I finally drove my '75 Westfalia today, for the
first time.  As is to be expected, I have a number of bugs to shake out, but
the most troubling is the alternator light.  It never went out.  After
checking the connections in the engine compartment and not finding anything
obvious, I figured, since they're cheap, I'd replace the voltage regulator.
$19.99 later, same problem.  My VOM give me a reading of 13.58 volts across
the battery at idle.

What other tests should I perform?  What should I look for?  Are there any
wires other than the ones that hook to the voltage regulator I should look
for?  Just how many wires come out of this alternator and where should they
go?

I have a spare alternator from the bus's old engine (It had a modified '76
engine, it now has a used '73, running a single two-barrel Solex carb), but
I'm reluctant to replace the one that's in there unless I am certain it
needs to come out.  Can I r&amp;r the alternator with the engine in place?  It's
a snap in my Vanagon, and in all the other (H2O cooled) VW's I've owned, but
all this tin has me worried...
