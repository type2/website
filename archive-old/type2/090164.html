&gt; &gt; Consult a machinist.
&gt;
&gt; Just curious about what tricks a machinist
&gt; might use in this sitution that couldn.t be
&gt; applied by a human bean.

They have specialized equipment, such as EDM machines that can literally
disintegrate the offending stud.

they generally prefer to see the part before the EZ-out is embedded in it,
though.
