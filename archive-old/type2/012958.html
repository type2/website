Subject: Re: [T2] New Improved Bus Motor Question
Date: Tue, 17 Apr 2001 13:23:47 US/Mountain

&gt;if you want your van to go 90, push it off a cliff.

All the kidding and &quot;useful&quot; advice aside, you have probably realized by now 
that buses were designed to haul buns, not butt.  Originally designed as cargo 
haulers and, shortly thereafter, as people haulers their finer points are big 
inside space, relatively small outside space, and simple enough that the 
average joe can work on them and keep them running.

The problem with speed in a bus is the poor aerodynamics and weight coupled 
with small displacement motors.  The highest horsepower motor VW ever put in a 
bus (up to 1979 anyway) was about 90 HP.  This was achived with the type-4 2.0 
fuel injected motor found in 75-79 buses.

Because of the weight-to-horsepower factor, VW geared the transmissions to get 
these heavy suckers off the line and (hopefully) up some mountain slopes.  I 
don't know the exact numbers off the top of my head, but ball-park figures 
would be something like 4000 RPM at about 70 mph.  To do 90 (assuming your 
engine was up to the task) you'd be seeing 5000+ RPM and that's WAY to fast to 
spin these little 4-bangers for extended periods of time.

If you really want a bus and you really want to be able to run 80-90 you need 1 
of 2 things.  You either need an engine that is happy running 5000 RPM all day 
long (ie. Porsche 911 6-cylinder motor) or do a tranny conversion that will let 
the bus run faster at lower engine speed.  If you do the latter, you need to be 
aware that 90 HP (stock 2.0 type-4 motor) is NOT enough to propel the bus into 
a 10 mph headwind or a up a 3% grade at 85 mph at 4000 RPM.  If you do the work 
yourself, figure anywhere from $1000 - 2000 for a tranny conversion and 
anywhere from $3500 - $5000 for a 911 motor conversion.  If you have someone 
else do the work for you, God help you and your budget.

If you think this is getting confusing, you're not alone.  HP/RPM/torque/road 
speed/wind resitance is a lot of variables to throw into a mix and come out 
with something useful.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that while it is 
possible to build a bus that will do 90 MPH, it is likely to be very expensive 
and very complicated to get the desired results.

I've got a 73 Westfalia Bus with a really good 2.0 type-4 motor mated to a 5-
speed transmission from an early Porsche 911.  Like you, I wanted my bus to do 
85-90 without blowing up every 3000 miles.  I can get that much speed with no 
trouble (ask David S. who had it cranked up over 100!).  But if I get any sort 
of headwind or highway (ie. mild) grade I have to downshift to 4th and keep my 
foot planted just like every other bus on the road.

And, as others have pointed out, buses were not designed for speeds over 75-
80.  My owner's manual stated something like 77 MPH as the top speed.  The 
brakes, suspension and steering are not designed to make the vehicle safe at 
extreme speeds.

Bottom line?  If you really want a highway cruiser to get you where you're 
going fast, look at some other vehicle.  If you want to take things slow and 
enjoy the ride, give yourself a little extra travel time and drive a bus.
