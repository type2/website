hummmmm.

fuel constriction??  but that would likely happen more at high RPM,
maybe a chattering double relay caused by loose wire, happened to me took
 forever to find it, was a terminal on the coil ;8*{

I would check first the electrical system using the DM and the VW FI
troubleshooting manual.

&gt; Vehicle: 1979 Westfalia
&gt; Engine: 2.0L FI with ~15,000km on rebuild
&gt; Tranny: AUTOMATIC
&gt; 
&gt; Problem: My bus has developed a bit of a hiccup in the last little while. It
&gt; started last summer (faintly) and has progressed slowly. The 3300 km trip to
&gt; Everybus and back really made this hiccup prominent. Anybody have any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt;  Symptoms: Only happens at idle. Only happens when in Drive (remember the
&gt; AUTO tranny). Engine idles and every few seconds it &quot;hiccups&quot; and causes the
&gt; engine to pulse.
&gt; 
&gt; I have checked the timing, dead on 7.5, idle is dead on at 950 RPM, points,
&gt; rotor, cap and wires all new and problem persists. I have found that is
&gt; worse in warmer temperatures and causes a slight bogging on low rpm (1st
&gt; gear) when engine is warmed up.
&gt; 
&gt; The funny part to this is the fact that it only happens when I have the van
&gt; in Drive or reverse. I have tons of power, runs perfect at high RPM and
&gt; idles perfect in Park or Neutral. Can anybody explain this situation before
&gt; I start replacing FI parts one-by-one?
&gt; 
&gt; AFM?
&gt; 
&gt; BTW...It was great to meet y'all at EBUS 2002 (my third one) and I look
&gt; forward to next year already.....
&gt; 
&gt; Ted, I missed your cherries......
