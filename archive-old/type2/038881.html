Which means they are in the archives at http://vw.i405_dot_com.  I have run 
heads with and without sodium filled valves in the past.  Had one solid one 
break on me but I didn't know the history of those heads (they were my 
first set ever, on the bus when I got it) so statistically that's 
meaningless.  I used to like the idea behind sodium filled valves, but I 
have used solids in all of my recent heads.  Main reason is cost - the 
sodiums are expensive.  I bought a set once for $100 but that was a long 
time ago and the prices I have seen recently were over $200/set.  I still 
have the set I bought on a shelf if anyone is interested in them.  I think 
they are 34mm (but I would have to check).  My opinion is that if your 
engine is running properly and does not overheat, then good quality 
stainless (like Manley) solid valves are all you need.

&gt;2 My case was junk, which was my fear.  The oil strainer stud was doing 
&gt;the wobble thing from being broken off from the inside of the case.  Bob 
&gt;had an available core from an 80 Vanagon or so, which he said just needed 
&gt;oil cooler mount modification.  As our conversation went on, he suggested 
&gt;we put Vanagon heads and pipes on it as well, and essentially make it a 
&gt;Vanagon engine.  My questions, will this work well?  What do I need to be 
&gt;aware of?  Why shouldn't we do this? Why should we? Any advice would be 
&gt;greatly appreciated.

If you have all the parts, including heater boxes, I'm sure it would all 
bolt together except for the tin.  I seem to remember that the 78 fan 
housing will not seal against the vanagon case though.  Maybe someone else 
could verify that?

But wait a second... the oil strainer stud is attached to the oil strainer, 
which is a replaceable part.  I don't see why that makes your case 
junk.  The bolt that holds the strainer in place is one of the case bolts, 
which is also replaceable.  If the case bolt hole is damaged, that can be 
repaired by welding (says Wilson).
