&gt; &gt; &gt;These were 'popular' aftermarket items, Kamei made them in the past,
&gt; &gt; &gt;for Bugs, Buses, VW used them on the Thing/181, and the have been
&gt; &gt; &gt;copied by many fiberglass 'specialists'.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Not for Baywindow busses. I have only seen them for 67 and older busses
&gt; and
&gt; &gt;vehicles with &quot;flat&quot; air intakes like the 181.
&gt; 
&gt; Just to nitpick (like everyone else) VW did increase the size of the upper
&gt; scoops on the later bays. No idea what the exact year was but on later bays
&gt; the scoop is the same height but sticks out more into the air stream. And
&gt; yes they did make fiberglass extensions for the early bay scoops. 

I think that they did it in '72 for the type IV engine.  The scoop lost
its sexy curve in favor of a more squarish intake area.

&gt; My cousin has a very nice unrestored 71 Gran Torino Fastback Talladega
&gt; (sp?) with a huge engine and... &quot;ram (or is it &quot;cold&quot;) air induction&quot;  that
&gt; is controlled by manifold vacuum. (For sale for $12K if anyone needs a 8MPG
&gt; commuter :-)) Any benefit to adding a 3rd scoop that is ducted to the air
&gt; horn on the air box to provide cooler outside air for the engine, or is air
&gt; flow such in the engine compartment (as is being discussed here, positive
&gt; vs negative pressure or attitude or something :-) ) that the intake air
&gt; never gets heated up?

Cold air induction takes advantage of the greater density of the cold air
to make more power.  It's probably worth a couple of percent.

However, the temperature of the free air in the engine bay is probably
pretty close to ambient.  That air goes through there pretty fast!
