Subject: Where's Waldo (CHT gauge sender, actually)

I was going to ask the question (see below), but a co-worker came by, and I 
asked him, and I got my answer.


BUT . . .  he asked me 'one or two gauges??'

Wait a minute ! ! That makes complete sense.  I have two engine heads on my 
'78, so which one do I think is more important, or should I expect them BOTH 
to be equally as hot ! !    N O T   . . ..

So, if you are going to put ONE CHT gauge on your VW, you are only getting 
1/2 the info you need/want.

(((  If one CHT, I guess I would attach it close to cylinder #3, which is 
reputed to get hottest because of the length of the travel for the cooling 
air flow.  But why not -2- CHT  ?? )))


Ideas ? ? ?

Barry sends


QUESTION:  Where and to what does the CHT connect to (on the engine of a '74 
bus, carbed and 1.8, w/out EPA pump).

I would like to save the CHT gauge AND the sender (and I guess from the 
discussions, the full length of wire between the gauge and sender) out of a 
donor.

ANSWER:  The CHT sender is a simple 'loop' connector (similar to a push-on 
connector at the end of a electrical wire, but you can attach the 'loop' 
connector with a screw)  that touches the head aluminum.  It does NOT screw 
in like the oil pressure sender.  It can be attached by drilling a hole in 
the head, and attaching the 'loop' with a screw, or can use a smear of J B 
Weld, and just slap it on.
