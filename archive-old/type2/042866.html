Subject: backing plates

Hello all,
Does anyone out there have or know where I can buy a pair of rear backing
plates for my 69 Westy?
It seems that I currently have 71-79 plates installed which I imagine is the
reason that I have been having brake trouble (overheating, blowing wheel
cylinders etc.). Also, if you know any safe modifications that I can make to
my existing system to prevent costly purchases I would appreciate that even
more.
TIA,
Jeff Mitchell
69 Westy &quot;Weezy&quot;
