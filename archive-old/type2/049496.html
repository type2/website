O.k. so i just got my 1600cc back in my bus after fixing the squeeky clutch 
bearing and everything seemed well until i tried to put it in gear after i 
started the bus and i couldn't get it into gear. The clutch feels fine and 
there's no noises coming from out back so whats going on? When i shut off the 
motor it runs through the gears just fine. Knowing me i probably screwed some 
thing up when reinstalling, let me know what you think.
