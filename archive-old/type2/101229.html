Subject: Looking for 74-79 bus frame in SouthEast/mid east coast...

Hey everyone.

After a good deal of work on my van, I am just not sure the thing is worth 
saving. 

So far, I know that I have to replace the following.
Inner rocker right
Outer rocker right
Inner rocker left
Outer rocker left
Front wheelarch right
Front wheelarch left
Left rear wheelhouse
Battery tray
Sliding door
front crossbeam

and there is extensive rust through the body in the front right pillar 
between the sliding door and front door, both wheelhouses to the floor pan, 
rust on the front floorpan, rust holes in the windscreen sill....sh#t, it 
just goes on and on. I didn't really realize it until tonight, after I went 
out to bus to see what replacement metal to order. I feel so bad, I could 
almost cry.

If anyone has a 74-79  straight body anywhere near Virginia, please let me 
know. All I need is the body, doesn't even have to be a rolling chassis, just 
have a decent body. paint and surface rust are no problem. I just can't see 
anyother option for myself at this point. That is a lot of replacement panels 
to deal with, I just don't think it is worth it.

thanks everybody,

Chris
