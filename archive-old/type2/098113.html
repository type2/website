Subject: 78 Westy FI Gas in Oil

Hello everyone,
 It seems that all injectors are spraying at the same time. I checked
this by removing the coil wire and turning the starter while watching 2
injectors that were removed from the motor. Is this normal or the
problem. How do I check whatever is causing this.  Thanks in advance for
your advice and knowledge.        

        Thanks
        Ralph   78 Westy
