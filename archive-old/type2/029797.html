&gt; Does the fact that both of these are not working at the same time , ring a
&gt; bell with anyone? Any quick suggestions as to what to trace/check? No
&gt; clicking at all from any relays that I can hear.

Has it rained recently?  You might have a leak which filled them up with
water.  Just happened to me!

Whoever the engineer was who mounted the relays upside down should be
shot!
