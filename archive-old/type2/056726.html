Subject: 1600 Stuck valve stems and other frustrations

I know, I said that was my last post on the matter.  I'm an optimist, shoot
me.  

Put the guns away, folks.  }:)  

This is long, I know.  I tend to throw words at a problem in the hope that
it sinks under the sheer weight of my verbiage.  Sorry.  

I got two *very* recalcitrant, *very* stuck intake valves.  :(  Probably
rusted to all-getout somewhere inside by exposure to New England's
particular brand of weather.  Cylinders #2 and #4... the rear two.  Hmm. 
Symptomatic of something?  Nothing I can think of, but then I'm a
neophyte...  

For those who missed it last time:  Apparently, New England's fritzy
weather got to my intake valves (I should have taken the rocker arms off
while storing the engine) and corroded... something. The valve, the
valve-guide, something.  And the intake valves are now sticking open,
causing blow-back through my carb, and preventing me from starting this
freshly-overhauled engine.  

Which sucks.  

My grandfather sez, when he got this problem (my uncle still does on his
'59 Packard in the spring here in New England --this is a *very* common
problem on older cars that sit about around here, apparently), he'd just
start the car up and let it run rough with some oil mixed into the
gasoline, the oil in the gas would usually loosen the valves right up in a
minute or two after judicious tapping on the valve-stem with a rubber
mallet.  

Of course, I can't do that:  it won't start with two out of four cylinders
having stuck valves.  

I have tried tapping the valve-stem with a mallet and a short length of
wooden dowel with the rocker arms off.  I then put the rocker arms back on,
rotated the engine to where the valve was being pushed open, rocked the
valve open and back open and back (this is #4, which will open easily, but
won't close all the way). 

I then opened the valve up, put a lenght of flexible plastic tubing into
the spark-plug hole aiming in the general direction of the valve, and
squirted penetrating oil through the tube.  Then pulled the tube out, stuck
the spark-plug back in, disconnected the coil, and cranked the engine a
little.  Checked the valve with feeler-gauges (well, by eye... we're
talking about 1/8&quot; of play between the tappets), and with a straight-edge
with the rocker arms off (I'm paranoid, sue me)... nope, still stuck in.  

Repeat.

Still stuck.  

Fine, we'll try the other one.  

#2 won't even go *in*. Won't budge, open or closed.  The squishy hydraulic
cam-lifter underneath it isn't helping, either.  :P  

Every five minutes, while I work, someone comes out of the house and says
&quot;Is it started yet?&quot;  

Be *very* glad that blow-guns with poison darts have never been distributed
in this country by WHAM-O.  

So, having wrenched thirty-two distinct muscles and ligaments out of whack
crawling around on the driveway, I mopped up the blood, bandaged my slit
wrists, and I called my grandfather.  

He sez:  &quot;Well, fill the chamber up with compressed air (I wish I had an
air compressor [I wish I had a spark-plug hole adaptor for an
air-compressor that would fit this head so I could borrow an air
compressor]), use a spring-compressor tool, take the spring off and see if
you can fix it without the spring in the way.&quot;  

Parts America doesn't have that tool.  How dare they.  Didn't they know I
have a valve problem on my VW?  

Frankly, though, I wouldn't know what the heck to do with it once the
valve-spring was off.  I mentioned the above two points.  

My grandfather sez:  &quot;Well, then, I guess you'll have to take off the heads
and do it that way, if nothing else works.&quot;  

Wince.  

Me:  &quot;Uh, you *do* know that means pulling 75% of the engine apart, right?&quot;
 

Him:  &quot;Do you have anything better to do?&quot;  

Me:  &quot;Yeah.  Finish the CV job and put the axles back on.&quot;  

Him:  &quot;Do that while you're taking a break from pulling the engine apart.&quot; 


Grumble, grumble.  

We parted on a &quot;Good luck.&quot;  I need it, oh yes.  

I then called the local last resort in Volkswagen land:  D&amp;D Auto.  (I
haven't spoken to them in a year; before that, not in 6 months.  When I
called:  &quot;Hi, um, my name is Josh and I've done some business with you in
the pas--&quot;  &quot;Hi, Josh!  How's your bus?&quot;  No kidding.)

I explained my dilemma to Andy's (the head guru) wife (subguru by osmosis).
 She said &quot;well, we can probably get those valves unstuck for you, but
we're booked clear through until the 10th of August.&quot;  

What the heck.  I made an appointment; if I can't get the things unstuck by
then, AAA can tow the bus down and they can unstick my valves.  If I do get
them unstuck, I'll cancel my appointment (by driving Lazarus down and
explaining in person... they're nice folks, don't want them to think I'm
cheating on them ;)).  

So, the point of this windy narrative cum saab-story?  

I've got 'till August 10th to unstick these valves, put the engine back
together, and start 'er up.  I've also been delivered an ultimatum:  Have
it running by August 26th, or get rid of it.  

[hitchuppants]

Me versus the stuck valves.  (Tyson/Holyfield, move over.  'Cept I won't
bite.  Much.  Love nibble, maybe...)  

Any suggestions on valve-unsticking, before I pull the engine and tear the
heads off? (why bother disassembling?  we'll just use this prybar...)  

Anyone *read* this far?  &lt;:)  

I'll shut up now, get some sleep.  Probably the best idea I've had all
day...
