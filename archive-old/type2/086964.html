&gt; &gt;troy,
&gt; &gt;  Did you put your finger in the oil to see how viscous it
&gt; &gt;is? Gear oil from the transaxle is going to be very thick. Even hot it
&gt; &gt;should be much thicker than the regular engine oil.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It has been my experience that it is very difficult to tell by eye or feel 
&gt; which type of lube is leaking, engine or tranny, certainly not 
&gt; conclusively. However, tranny lube does have a decidedly sulfer smell and 
&gt; motor does not. This is only the case with dyno lube. I don't have a clue 
&gt; what synthetic gear lube smells like, but some of them are dyed blue.

one of the worst things about synthetic (at least the ones I have
used) have mostly smelled like burned/overheated dyno oil right out of the
jug
