Subject: Re: [T2] BAP Heads?

&gt; I don't understand why you suggest avoiding &quot;that rebuilder&quot;.

You haven't said exactly what it was you bought other than it was  
dual port but I thought it was obvious. You said, &quot;I'm a little  
pissed since it's well passed the warrantee but in fact they were  
never right. I wonder if anyone else is having this problem or if I'm  
the only fool that buys heads from BAP&quot;.

Castings are generally indistinguishable from one another. When I say  
rebuilder I mean BAP or whomever they paid to install the seats in  
the head (perhaps the head mfgr).

&gt; My problem
&gt; heads came from BAP and the seats eroded away plain and simple, I  
&gt; saw them.
&gt; The engine made it 80K miles on the previous heads so I don't see  
&gt; how that
&gt; could have been anything else but bad seats.

I'm missing your point. Are you saying they are good heads?

&gt; That is
&gt; what is going to be done and I have a lot more faith in that method  
&gt; then
&gt; buying some off the shelf head assembled with unknown parts with a  
&gt; token
&gt; warranty.

I agree.

&gt; Unleaded has been phased over the years and in some counties in the  
&gt; last
&gt; couple of years. Perhaps seats not designed for unleaded could have  
&gt; been
&gt; used on heads in other countries and worked fine. And perhaps there  
&gt; was some
&gt; old seat stock that was used on this batch of heads? Or maybe it  
&gt; was just a
&gt; metal quality problem. With stuff being imported from all over the  
&gt; world I
&gt; don't think that's too much of a stretch.

Unleaded isn't the issue. One type of seat costs pennies and one  
costs dollars and the speed inatwhich the head was rebuilt is passed  
onto the consumer.
