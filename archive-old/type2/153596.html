Subject: RE: [T2] poptop seal

&gt; The ones I have been seeing aren't like original
&gt; but are said to do the job.
&gt; Anyone found a generic seal that does the job?
&gt; Im sure that the ones being sold are off a fridge
&gt; or something and should be in a parts catalog
&gt; somewhere for 30 cents a foot :)


Many Bus parts vendors do repackage generic off-the-shelf weatherstrip as
poptop seal, but I don't. Mine is custom made to my specs and designed just
for this purpose. In fact, poptop seal was the Bus Depot's very first custom
product, so we've been doing it for a long time. You can find some info on
our canvas and seals at http://busdepot_dot_com/details/canvas.jsp .

You may save a little bit of money (probably not much) buying a generic
length of weatherstrip instead of a proper seal. Some even look somewhat
similar, but they are different enough to be less functional, which is why I
went to the trouble to design my own. If a poptop seal doesn't seal well,
your canvas can get wet during heavy rain (causing mildew), and it may not
insulate your bus as well when the top is down during cold weather driving.
(We all know that the Bus heating system is not its forte anyway, even when
everything _is_ properly sealed. :-)  If the luggage rack seal is not
properly designed, it can trap rainwater under your luggage rack, causing
your roof to rust under the luggage rack over time. Also, of course, generic
weatherstrip won't look as close to stock. (Mine's not a perfect copy, but
it's the closest available.) Of course it's your money and your call, but
even a proper poptop seal is a fairly inexpensive purchase, and it will
probably last as long as you own your bus.  If it better protects your
canvas and/or roof over time, it's a good investment.
