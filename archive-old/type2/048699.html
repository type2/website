Subject: Re: [T2] 74 exhaust on a 79?

you can do this no problem.  If the heat exchangers have a trapezoidal flange
dual port then use 72-74 style muffler if they have only one triangular one buy
one of the later model replacement systems such as from pacesetter (what i am
currently using).  no welding needed but if you use a pacesetter system you need
to buy some nuts and bolts. the only tools needed are a socket set and maybe vice
grips to hold nuts while you tighten the bolts, remember to use new gaskets.  It
is a PITA to mate the pacesetter system, the original style with the studs welded
to the muffler are much easier to mount . the pacesetter is frustrating, though
not difficult, work.  muffler replacement was the first repair i ever did on a
bus, on a 73, i found it to not be difficult at all but with a stock style
muffler, on my 78 with the pacesetter it is annoying ... actually i need to put
mine back on this weekend...ughhh
good luck

&gt; Hey folks,
&gt;    79 Westy in need of exhaust.  Everything gone behind heat exchangers. 79,
&gt; is of course, a 79 only exhaust system. But I see in the Bus Depot catalog
&gt; that a 74 system will work, but w/ no converter.
&gt;      Here in Northern Wisconsin, we have no smog checks, no inspections, etc.
&gt; So the missing converter thing is irrelevant.  (Sorry if you are an
&gt; environmental activist or something)
&gt;     I'm wondering- has anyone bolted 74 exhaust on their 79? Can a layman
&gt; like me with ordinary hand tools bolt 74 exhaust right on? Without a torch or
&gt; a welder?
&gt;
