Subject: Fwd:  Help: brakes

Hi,
 
&gt; ...  The brakes are still
&gt; spongy!?!?!?!  I can push the pedal to the floor.  Pumping doesn't
help.

 If pumping doesn't help then there must be something seriously wrong
with the plumbing, or loads of air still in the system.

 I take it there are no bubbles in the fluid coming out of the bleed
nipples?

Cheers,
	W.
