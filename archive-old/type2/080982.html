Ok, so I am still new to this ok! Lol  Jason, I do have a VOM although I
am not good with it yet. The bottom spade wire must not have been on as
tight as it should have because I got under and decided to wiggle it
some more and now it turns over.  I am thinking about redoing the
connector on the wire.  Thanks 

(im still chuckling)  lol

Troy,
	If I recall, your solenoid has two spade connections. One on the
top &amp; one on the bottom the larger of the two wires went to the top
one &amp; the smaller went to the bottom. Did you ever pick up a VOM? This
would be handy to check if there is any juice going to these
connections. Since you have moved these wires some now, &amp; even that
seems to effect when your bus starts, there could be a short in any of
the wires that we worked on. this could cause this problem. This is
one area you really need a VOM.

&gt; Ok, so the connections on the starter were pretty rusted up and while
at
&gt; EB, the bus would not start because of this.  Jason Laster took a look
&gt; for me and after a few scraps with a wire brush, the baby turned over
&gt; :-)  Well, I put the bus on the ramps and proceded to give the stubs
on
&gt; the starter a nice good cleaning.  Well, now that I cleaned all the
&gt; points, it wont turn over.  Not even a click.  Now, I am not sure if
it
&gt; matters what wires get put on first or last as far as the group going
on
&gt; the celenoid stud, but I don't think I put them back on in the same
&gt; order.  Would this matter?  Also, the large cable going from the
starter
&gt; to the celenoid is pretty green.  I detached it from the celenoid and
&gt; cleaned that stub and the connector on it and put it back on.  Also,
&gt; there is a black piece of plastic that covers the forward portion of
the
&gt; celenoid, in which the stubs come out of it.  I did break  a small
piece
&gt; of it off  (About 1 inch).  Not sure if this matters but wanted to
&gt; include everything.  Thanks
