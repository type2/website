Subject: Re: [T2] Size of oil temp sender

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Some time ago, I installed an oil temp sender in the sump plate of my '78 Bus.
&gt; This involved drilling a hole, welding a nut onto the inside of the plate, etc.
&gt;  but now I seem to have a small oil leak that seems to
&gt; be coming from around the temp sender. I figure that I should take it out (doing
&gt; an oil change at the same time) and put a new crush washer in there.

I have the same problem i'm going to use a liberal amount of silicone to make it
nice and leak proof.  My sender is in the inspection plate though.
Good luck
Jamie
