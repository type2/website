Subject: '69 trans problem

Today, if all goes well, I will pick up my '69 westy.  I was distraught after the falling through of the deal with the '68 I was supposed to buy, but the '69 is in better shape.  This one also has a tranny problem, however.  It tends to jump second gear.  Does anyone know of another reason for this occurence except for an internal tranny problem?  I am just resigned to replace the thing otherwise.  Also, anyone know of a place that has the original type curtain material for the '69 westy? It's kinda an earth-tone plaid (non-offensive)  I am attached to the stuff, but 27 years of sun has done it wrong.

Also, to the guy asking about the WCM products, The door gaskets (for '68-`79)  are $99 apiece  from them and only $15 from RMMW!  I don't know if the WCM ones are worth all that extra bread.  I guess we'll just see, the RMMW ones should be here next week..
