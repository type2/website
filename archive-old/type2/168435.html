Subject: Re: [T2] hypothesis

I fab'd my rockers and some other body panels out of stainless :)

I've had a few dealings with deloreans. cool cars, but yes there is a
tendency for the frames to rust out. I guess the repros are going to
have a stainless frame.  They are rear-engine, which makes them a
distant relative of the volkswagen. (they are also underpowered by
most sports car standards)

There were several deloreans bought and modified for the production of
Back to the Future Part III. One of which was a modified delorean body
on a VW bug frame with a VW motor. The stock delorean was too low to
the ground to go off-road in the old west scenes. (hence marty tearing
a fuel line.... which BTW is near impossible the way they are
designed).

They decided to go baja buglorean.

I can't remember exactly where, but there was a scene in the old west
if you looked hard enough you could see parts of the exhaust and it
was clearly not DMC.

I've often wondered about grabbing an old delorean with a blown motor
and installing a type4 power plant. IIRC, The stock delorean engine
was a volvo/renault V6 with Bosch fuel injection. Pretty sure it
turned the same way.
