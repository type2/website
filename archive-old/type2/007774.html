&gt;Now, that I have this installed, I have noticed that she is tough to 
start.
&gt;She just cranks and cranks, never lighting up.  Then all of a sudden, 
boom,
&gt;she's started!! (there is no literal BOOM...) 
&gt;
&gt;How could changing the AFM cause this to happen?
&gt;
&gt;It's like the engine isn't getting any gas...
&gt;
&gt;any ideas?
&gt;

I ran that AFM on my bus for 2 days to make sure it worked. It did. I 
had no hard start or long cranking problems. 
First I would check that the fuel pump is running while the engine is 
cranking. 
Then I would test fuel pressure.
It kinda sounds like you have a lean mixture problem. That AFM ran and 
idled perfectly where the mixture screw is set [on my engine]. If your 
pressure is low you will have a lean problem.
