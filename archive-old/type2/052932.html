Hi Mike, Travis, Etc...

I have a similiar problem with my 73 1700cc Dual-carb'ed bus, it sometimes
loses power for a minute or two when running at highway speed. No matter how
hard you matt the pedal, speed gradually drops to 35-40 MPH and I pull over.
Once at the side of the road, I rev the engine a few times to listen for
errant noises, but I am yet to hear anything unusual. But after a minute or
so curbside, it settles out and runs just fine.

The last time this happened I was running the bus from with a NEW fuel
filter connected to  a 5-gallon auxiliary fuel tank, but it has also
happened numerous times previously from the original tank.  So (At least in
my case) it isn't likely to be fuel flow. More likely a vaccuum leak or an
intermittent problem with the fuel pump itself.

Alternate Hypothesis: Perhaps a piece of vacuum hose is collapsing under
sustained load???

I'm going to keep an eye on it, and shop around for a good carb rebuilder to
work over my Solex 30-34's. And source some new vac. hose and elbows, too.

BTW, my 73 tank has a 3/4&quot; fitting on the tank nipple to remove the entire
assembly, whereas my 79 's tank just has the nipple welded into the base of
the tank. When I pulled the tank from the 73 to install it in the 79 last
weekend, there wasn't a thing inside. YMMV.

Happy trails,

&gt; Sorry this is so late, as I was backpacking all weekend.
&gt; 
&gt; Travis, I'll bet you a dollar I know exactly what is wrong with your
&gt; bus, as I had the same problem in my '79 Westy: clogged fuel tank.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's my story and how I fixed it (dredged and adapted from the
&gt; archives):
&gt; 
&gt; This past summer, while travelling in my 79 Westy through Washington, I
&gt; experienced an intermittant loss of power.  Every time I'd
&gt; shift into a higher gear and start accelerating, the bus would
&gt; suddenly lose power.  Eventually, the problem became constant and I
&gt; couldn't get the bus over 50mph.  I suspected a fuel line problem, maybe
&gt; even gunk in the tank (the PO kept the bus sitting in a garage for years.)
&gt; 
&gt; By some luck, I found a VW shop called &quot;Denny's&quot; nearby and asked for
&gt; some help.  Denny had an extra fuel filter, but that didn't do the trick.
&gt; After a few other checks and some discussion, Denny came to the conclusion
&gt; that there was something in the tank clogging the fuel lines.  He
&gt; suggessted that the tank be removed and cleaned!
&gt; 
&gt; Denny was kind enough to let me use his driveway and I was able to do
&gt; the work myself (and I didn't even have to drop the engine.)  It took two
&gt; days to do the entire job (what a royal PITA), but here's what I found:
&gt; 
&gt; Once the tank was removed and allowed to dry, a big chunk of rubber
&gt; fell out.  It turns out that a piece of rubber eroded from the fuel filler
&gt; neck, fell into the tank, and once in a while it would settle to the
&gt; bottom and cover the holes leading to the fuel lines!
&gt; 
&gt; This piece of rubber is the part of the filler neck that looks like a
&gt; bird beak (I'm assuming it prevents one from using the leaded gas
&gt; nozzles).  The weird thing is, it looks like some PO actually replaced
&gt; this filler neck since it had the same &quot;bird beak&quot; which exactly matched
&gt; what i found in the tank. The part was badly eroded and looked like it was
&gt; about to fall into the tank as well!  Needless to say, I just cut the
&gt; damned beak off.
&gt; 
&gt; After I put the tank back, the problem disappeared.  I still keep the
&gt; chunk of rubber on the dash to illustrate my stories ;^)
&gt; 
&gt; My recommendation to you Travis: before you yank the tank, see if you can
&gt; find some sort of instrument to probe the inside (be sure to drain the
&gt; tank first.)  Ideally, you'd want one of those miniature cameras at the
&gt; end of a flexible tube, but I have no idea where to find one of these.  My
&gt; next idea is this: get a stiff piece of wire (coat hanger will do) and
&gt; probe the tank from underneath (where the fuel outlet and return are
&gt; located.)  My bet is that you eventually encounter some resistance when
&gt; you poke up and the wire hits the chunk of rubber (or other garbage that
&gt; settled to the bottom of the tank.)  If indeed you find something, you
&gt; will now have to find a way to remove it.  Keep me posted and I'll walk
&gt; you through tank removal without dropping the engine.  You may even be
&gt; able to invent some sort of tool to recover the debris.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck!
