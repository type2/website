Subject: Re: [T2] Bob Hoover

Folks,

Richard really does say it all....I have been on various lists since 
1984....yeah, maybe that tells you something&lt;grin&gt;..but! .*generally*, the 
folks with reasonable attitudes and mellow dispositions will stay...the 
folks that are irritable, &quot;their way or the hiway&quot; or just plain obnoxious
will generally fade into obscurity.

I miss Jake, but I don't miss diatribes from *anyone*.

What I miss **more** is the folks that had genuinely illuminating 
information that I no longer see postings from  because they have felt 
menaced in some way that was **not** appropriate....enuff said...

I have actually had illuminating info from Bob Hoover on the vintage vw 
list...very reasonable and informative responses...I couldn't believe that 
he responded to a question about 3way valve jobs on the list....but!  I 
was getting &quot;misleading&quot; info from everyone else!

I've seen the &quot;sermons&quot; from Bob and been impressed....there *used* to be 
a saying on the net....

&quot;the people that gave away the most information were the most revered&quot;

Think about it....ramblings from dave on a Wed night...&lt;grin&gt;

Bus content:  I expect to add an ignition off/radio &quot;on&quot; switch to my bus 
this weekend and also add a complete alarm system/keyless entry/remote 
start.


Happy Thanksgiving to all of those still here and who might be here!


Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt;I had chased down Jake Raby during the Mallory Dizzy 
&gt; &gt;battle recently. He said he refused to come back to the T2 list 
&gt; &gt;because of those kinds of fights. The exact quote: 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&quot;If anyone asks where I'm at tell them that the assholes got the best
&gt; &gt;of me and I won't be back to that list.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; There are always two sides to every story. You should ask the listmembers he sent 
threatening photos and emails to how they like his ettitque. Maybe he was on the verge of getting the boot anyway...
&gt; 
&gt; Some people don't engage in list conversation: they have time to 
write up long winded opinions but claim they have no time to interact and reply. No big loss under those circumstances.
