Subject: The reason my bus won't start...

I recently bought a 1970 Bus, and when I tried to start it, after changing the battery, it would not start.  When I changed the battery, there were a lot of sparks and the area around the alternator had quite a bit of smoke.  As it turns out, the idiot PO used a red battery cable as the NEGATIVE, and a black cable for the POSITIVE.  So, by using common sense...Red=Pos, Black=Ground, I connected the battery backwards. 
 
How much damage do you think I did?  Luckilly, I don't have a dashboard, instruments, or radio installed yet, so basically only the electrical components on the engine could have been damaged.  Should I replace the Voltage Regulator?  Alternator?  The damage would have to stop at the alternator, right?  
 
I'm going to dig in this Saturday, and I wanted to get a head start with some good solid advice.
 
Thanks,
Matt
