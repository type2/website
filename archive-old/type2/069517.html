Subject: Re: August HMN ads - barndoor trivia

&gt;'53 barn door single cab (well not really a barn
&gt;door I guess) smooth gate, no rust complete $8500
&gt;(541)770-7411 OR

Also, an educational note: early '53 and back to August of '52, the gates
were smooth; later they had a stamping with the pattern.  Also, early double
cabs have a vertical seam in the middle of the gate, where a single cab gate
was cut and shortened.

Just flowing the useless trivia
