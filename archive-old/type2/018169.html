Ok.... I am  at the end of the school year and I have a 5 minute speech
to present...I'm supposed to be working on it now...  but it is on
Volkswagen busses since I fell completely in love with mine.  I can use
Power Point, thats what I intend on using.  If anyone could help me out
in ANY way by telling me/pointing me into the direction of - VW history,
VW power point presentations, any info, any good outlines, what would be
most effective etc.....
Or even write it for me...jk!
but it will all be done on powerpoint.
This actually DOES have something to do with keeping busses on the road
because if I get a good grade on it...then my teacher is going to help
me fix my shifter and other assorted things on my bus....but he would
really like to know something about them too.

well....thank you a LOT!
I need this by thursday.

Muchos Gracias! and good karma to all that are kind enough to help
