Subject: Electronic Ignition

I have already started planning for this winter's &quot;indoor activity&quot;
[this is New Brunswick and the Bus heating system just wasn't designed
for -30].  I am going to build a 1600dp that can be dropped into
either Ras Bulli Split ['66 Westy] or the [yet nameless] '74 Thing.

I have been brow beat ;) long enough and am giving into Hoover's
sermons on this one [I can freely admit this as Bob is still returning
from Inuvik and won't be able to contractually hold me to the
statement ;)].  I am going for the hydraulic cam followers, full-flow
oil filtration, and CD ignition, plus a few other items to bring the
engine a few decades past 1940. [Though I haven't decided if I will
bore this one out or keep that part stock].

This long disjointed ramble leads I to my question about Electronic
Ignition [as advertised in the subject line].  Has anyone out here in
Virtual VW world had experience with the Jacobs Electronics ignition
systems [Bug-Pak, Mileage Master, Pro-10, Pro-street, or Omni-Pak]?
They claim to be drop in EI systems, though from the advertisement I
read, most seem to supply their own coil.  Are these just CDI systems
like the one carried at JCW that use the distributer for RPM feedback
to gauge the firing rate?  Are they adjustable to compensate for
non-stock setups [for example not retarding #3 because the oil cooler
has been moved...one of the ideas I am considering for the rebuild]?
How pricey are the Jacob Engineering Systems and do they deliver any
benefits over the $80 JCW CDI kit?

All feed back and brow-beating accepted ;)  

See John [Croteau], I never claimed I was a purist...I just keep my
mods a little harder to find [Ok, so you only have to open the hatch ;)]

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!

Roy
