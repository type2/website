No Garp you don't have to be a rocket scientist. Most of us drive old
Volkswagens for the precise reason being that we can do our own mechanical
repairs. The first &quot;big&quot; job I did was the exact procedure you're looking
at. My '65 Beetle had sheared a piston. Following John Muir's book I pulled
the engine and rebuilt the top end. This all completed in my future in-laws
back yard. It took me about a week, but I was only working on it evenings
when I got home from work. When I completed, and the car actually ran, I was
amazed that something I repaired could propel me 65 mph down the highway. So
don't be afraid to tackle this job. Furthermore, you have a source like this
to ask any of the questions you might have to any number of experts.
As far as &quot;going bigger&quot;, giving the fact that you say your budget is
limited I would stick with your stock setup. Speed costs money. 1600 parts
are the most readily available, and since you may be relatively
inexperienced you might be better off with keeping your engine stock. Good
Luck.
