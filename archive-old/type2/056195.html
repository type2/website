Subject: Engine replacement cost - - -

Well Girls and Boys, after avoiding a Type 4 engined bus for many years 
because of the seemingly exorbitant cost of engine rebuilds and associated 
components, I've just had a quantum shift in my perspective on such things.

An old friend (in both senses of that term) has just returned this evening 
from an expedition to float the Missouri River below Great Falls in Montana.  
On the return trip to Tacoma his humongous 1985 Ford 4WD diesel pickup, 
carrying his equally humongous camper and towing his drift boat, blew the 
engine on I-90 a few miles East of the Idaho line.  Internal block failure, 
non-repairable.

To make a long story shorter, after much calling all over the USA for sources 
of a replacement engine, he had the Missoula Ford dealer install a factory 
rebuilt long-block.  He actually got a very good deal on the job, because 
labor costs in Missoula are much lower than on the West Coast and there's no 
sales tax in Montana.

Bottom line:  The long-block ALONE cost $7,000.00!!!  This was a nearly 
complete engine, lacking just the alternator and AC pump.  Out the door with a 
factory 24 month - 24,000 mile warranty he squeaked in at just under 
$8,000.00.

This engine had 120,000 extremely well maintained highway miles on it when it 
blew (my friend's a recently retired fireman).

All things considered, it makes the installed cost of a replacement Type 4 
engine with new heat exchangers, exhaust system, etc. seem almost (I did say 
&quot;almost&quot;) reasonable.

I think I'm going to go and be very ill, now.  

For the price of that diesel engine I could have (in my 1970 Campmobile) a 
brand-new 1600 DP, a meticulously remanufactured transaxle and drive train, a 
complete brake rebuild with all new parts, a front-end rebuild with a rebuilt 
steering box, new upholstery, some minor ding-removal work, and a pretty nice 
paint job.  In fact I'd probably have enough money left over to take the whole 
family out for a really nice celebration dinner at the local McDonald's.....

Proof positive that old Type 2s really are an economical mode of 
transportation.
