Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Timing Help?'s

I made a major typo in my post that confused some people. Here is what I wrote:

&quot;When a piston is at TDC either its valves are rocking or the opposing cylinder in the firing order has
rocking valves. Rocking valves are when the intake just closes and the exhaust will just start to open.&quot;

The correct 2nd sentence should read:
Rocking valves are when the EXHAUST just closes and the INTAKE just starts to open.

Hopefully this will clear up some of the confusion:)
