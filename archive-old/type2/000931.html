&gt; My daughter is giving a speech in her 6th grade class on Wednesday. Her
&gt; topic, chosen by her, is the VW Westfalia camper conversions. While well


Her speech was delayed until today. So off she went loaded down with pics
and info from all those who helped out. She gave her speech and her teacher
responded with: &quot;very informative, I had no idea there where so many
differences in the VW campers&quot; His comments included &quot;nice intro&quot; &quot;very
informative&quot; and &quot;nice way to sum it up&quot;.

Wanna know what grade she got?...She made dad proud! A! :-)
She would like to thank all the wonderful &quot;westy&quot; folks out there that
helped with pics, info, urls, etc, along with moral support!

A very special thankyou from Sarah, my 11 yr. old daughter, to the following
&quot;special&quot; people: (with a supporting class of people like them...how could
she not get an A)&lt;g&gt;

PS If we forgot anyone we are sorry. Could someone pass this post on to the
vintage bus list please. Also, with all the pics of the older westies, guess
what dad wants now? Yep, a splitty. :-)
