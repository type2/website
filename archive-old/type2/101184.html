Voltage is at 12v, idiot lights 
go on, but nothing - not even a click - from
the starter.&lt;&lt;

Sounds like it could be a stuck solenoid. Try to crawl under there and give
the solenoid and starter a couple of whacks all around the case with a hammer,
not too hard, not too soft! Then give it a try, it may start for you and at
least get you back home. If it works, don't turn off your engine until you
reach your destination, though! Plus, you can always push start it just to get
you home.
Then when you get home, starter R&amp;R is a piece of cake, done from underneath
with engine in place. Two bolts, slide the old one out and the new one in. The
only PITA is reaching the top nut from the engine bay (ie. Have you hugged
your engine today?!) D'oh, although you are a pancake engine, so the previous
statement may not apply ;^)
Good luck &amp; PEACE! John Baker
