&gt; hey, mine broke too recently in my 69 bug, but I kept it to myself.  I
&gt; cheeped out and put a used one in. Actually I didn't feel like going
to the
&gt; store.

Pretty much my story.  I vaguely recall considering that the old fork
was getting worn out where it pivots on the throwout bearing, but I
didn't have a new one to compare to.  Turns out that the old fork was
has worn about halfway through to the retaining clip &quot;notch&quot;, so it
was bound to go.

Lesson here is that $10 spent when the engine is out for another
reason can save pulling it later.  Even if the arm is OK, it will pay
to weld the levers more securely to the shaft, as it seems to be not a
matter of if the levers will break off, but when.

OTOH, this is giving me the opportunity to replace the engine bay
seals (which were OK but getting brittle) and the fuel hoses (one was
getting soft after only 2 years on what passes for gasoline in SoCal.)

Now if the rain will only hold off long enough for me to get the
engine back in!

  Bugster has  Better heat than the splitty, but the defogger works
&gt; better in the bus.  Then the clutch died again, this time the
circlip that
&gt; held the arm that takes the cable disappeared, and the arm came off
downtown
&gt; and it would be hard to speed shift home from there and I called for
help and
&gt; got a tow home (from a 71 bus thank you Zach) and pulled the motor
again
&gt; (maybe I'll make the rear apron unboltable like the bus, I need a
better jack,
&gt; durnit its raining so hard the water is puddling on thegarage floor,
I should
&gt; restore this bug, had it eight years now, at least put electrical
tape squares
&gt; over the holes for the trim that isn't there to keep the rain from
falling in,
&gt; every time I wash it it turns a more interesting mottled combination
of
&gt; red/camo/two tone blue) so I probably should have bought  new one
and saved
&gt; myself the hassle.  sorted out the arm and the TO arm and it has held
&gt; together the last few days.

Your bug sounds like ours, which we call the &quot;Urban Assault
Volkswagen&quot;.  Mechanically it's great, but we hold off of painting it
for fear that it will be ripped off.

Now I'm worrying about the fork in our bus... :)
