I am trying to remove the cover on the drivers side, that would cover
the track for the sliding door, if I had a slider on the drivers side.
So far I've removed the 3 Phillips head screws from underneath. I cannot
see anything else holding this cover. The Bentley manual only shows the
passenger side runner cover. I've tried gentle persuasion with a rubber
mallet, but it won't budge. Anyone?

Thanks,
