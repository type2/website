&gt; I'm having trouble bonding with the editor on the news reader at my new
&gt; site, so I've been unable to post this on rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled.
&gt; On that group there was a thread recently about the [in]famous one-liner:
&gt; &quot;If Ted Kennedy had been driving a Volkswagen, he'd have been President by
&gt; now.&quot;

Hmm... it sounds like they might have reprinted an old VW ad. Back in 
the late 60s, when VW was running all their &quot;odd&quot; ads, one of them 
featured a VW floating in a lake.

I dunno... it was supposed to show they were well built, or something.
