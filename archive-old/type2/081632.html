Subject: [T2] Connecting Rod Removal

&gt;...is it possible to remove
&gt;the connecting rods in advance of splitting the case?

Tap the bolts and the rod will come loose, but don't
lose those bearing shells in the case.

&gt;On a second note, the walls of the cylinders appear (I
&gt;have yet to measure) to be significantly thinner than
&gt;those from a 1700 engine shown to me by my local
&gt;mechanic

Measure the pistons, stock 1.7 is 90 mm.
A common big bore kit can be 96mm.
