Subject: no spark

I have installed my engine now and have a problem
getting a spark.  Is there any specific wires I should
check as the causee?  Also, I had to reset the dizzy
as it popped out while I had the engine out, but this
would not cause there to be absolutely no spark would
there?   I pulled a spark plug wire off at the cap and
confirmed there is absolutely no spark there either. 
What should I check?  sincerely, really want to get my
van started.
