Subject: Fuses and wiring questions

Vehicle: 1978 Westy

Question: After spending some more time this weekend rewiring/reconnecting 
the dash I came up with a question...

Does anyone have a list of the fuses and their sizes? There are 12 fuses in 
my fuse box and 1 don't know if they need to be 7.5 amps or 15 amps or 
whatever... I thought I had this stored someplace but I can't find it. I 
checked the owner's manual with no luck, checked my Haynes with no luck, 
and my Bentley I loaned to a good friend so I don't have that at my finger 
tips.

Update: all of the instruments (new and old) are in place. The dash 
lighting works. The exterior lighting works. Now all I have to do is 
reconnect the VDO instruments to the wiring that is already in place. The 
tach will require new wiring. Gotta find those instructions so I know what 
goes where on it.

Question #2: I did the headlight upgrade - that is the relays to move power 
directly from the battery (via a new auxiliary fuse panel in the engine 
compartment) to the headlights. The old high beam / low beam relay and 
switches simply toggle the new relays. What are your opinions about 
replacing the fuses in the OEM location with much smaller relays since they 
are only powering the relays? Seems prudent so a short to ground would not 
cause a fire...

Any idea what the loads would be and thus how small the fuses could be?
