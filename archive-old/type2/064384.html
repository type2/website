&gt; So what's the trick?

The only advice I received was to just pinch the connector and it 
will come loose.  Vague, but useful.  Here's what I learned this past 
weekend from removing entire FI wiring harness.

The spring wires are JUST wide enough to allow one to squeeze one 
side to allow the other side to slide over the catch.  Then while 
that side is past the catch squeeze the other side and gently pull to 
free up the remaining side.
Here's the trick.
You can get a better squeeze by using your fingernail to push 
against the wire.

FWIW, For the cold start switch gizmo, I reversed the 
position of the wire, so that the open ends are up and available to 
the world for pushing with a screwdriver.  Far easier to disconnect 
when messing with distributor.
