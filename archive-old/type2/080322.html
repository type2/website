Subject: Re: [T2] 1981 Diesel Rabbit 

&gt; hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; i realize that this is the bus list, but i figure
&gt; maybe someone on here will own one of these, and maybe
&gt; be willing/able to give me the rundown.
&gt; 
&gt; i am buying a 1981 Diesel Rabbit and i am wondering if
&gt; anyone has any info for me regarding any aspect of
&gt; this vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt; i am unfamiliar with the diesel, other than the fact
&gt; that &quot;people say&quot; they are supposed to be super
&gt; durable.
&gt; 
&gt; how does the diesel engine function, what makes it
&gt; &quot;diesel&quot; other than that it runs diesel feul.
&gt; 
&gt; also, my superviser at work told me (he used to own
&gt; one) that you have to plug them in during the winter
&gt; months, because the feul will freeze. something about
&gt; a glow plug??
&gt; 
&gt; any and all info will be greatly appreciated!!!

Matt,

Don't know if you got any responses, but here's a couple of
quick ones:

1) John Muir Publications put out an Idiot Book for the Rabbits.
   It was my first introduction to VWs and VW maintainence
   (first hand, at least...I had watched dad fix our Bugs for years).
	
   Their description of Der Diesel and how it works is great, buy
   this book if you are looking to work on Rabbits of any type.

2) anecdotal evidence:  I know a number of folks who have put 200,000+
	miles on a VW diesel engine in rabbits and dashers

3) a gasoline engine works by internal combustion -- the piston
	compresses the gasoline/air vapor and the spark plug &quot;sparks&quot;,
	igniting the mixture.
   a diesel engine works by compressing the fuel to a high enough
	pressure that it's boiling point, or flash point, is &quot;room temperature&quot;.
	So, when the piston compresses the diesel/air mixture, it 
	&quot;explodes&quot; without requiring a spark.  So, these are HIGH compression
	engines, which I guess, somehow results in less wear and tear

4) to start your diesel engine in the SUPER COLD weather, i.e. winter, you
	need to warm up the cylinder to a more reasonable temperature.  This
	is, i believe, what the glow plugs do.

	I expect in extreme cold (&lt; 0 F), you could risk your fuel &quot;freezing&quot;
	and would want to plug in your bunny, but it'd have to be pretty cold.

I take that back.  Some dilligent web searching puts the Freezing point
of diesel at -40-&gt; -30 deg F (http://www.e85fuel_dot_com/information/fuelproperties.htm)
so, it'd have to be REALLY F**KING COLD for the fuel to freeze, however,
it's possible that the amount of time it would take a measely glow plug
to warm up your cylinder to the appropriate temp (if it could even do it)
would be prohibitive, so you'd want to keep it plugged in.

Etc. 

I've CC'd my friend Erik, as he had an ~84 Wolfsburg diesel Rabbit and
has practical experience in Connecticut winters with Der Diesel.
(erik, please respond to matt directly, if you don't mind...)


Anyway, bus content:

I know folks have converted their busses to diesels using golf/gti 
or other engines, and, I know there were diesel busses (not many, but
a few, right?), but is there such a beast as an AIR COOLED diesel engine?

I'm curious becuase I love the simplicity of my air cooled engine, but
I'd love to get to something more sustainable, like a diesel engine
running on veggie oil.  This is especially pertinent in Cali where
there's legislation under consideration which would drastically raise
the taxes on gasoline over the next 6 years, as coupled with other 
programs to gently prod (v|f)olks towards more enviro-friendly transport.

Sure, electric is one solution, but at present, it's not a long-distance
(700+ mile roadtrip) solution -- at least not until there are more
charging stations nationwide.

Anywho, just curious.  Maybe I'll just have to pick up that AC engine
design book.

happy friday!
