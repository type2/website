Subject: seals and ebrake

i bought a few sets of spark plug seals from wcm, and they just slip right
over the spark plug boot on the end of the wire.  it actually works quite
well since the hole in the seal is a little smaller than the boot, and it
compresses around the boot.  but i do have seals.  

as for the ebrake cable clips, the only way i could get my ebrake cable
out of the backing plate was to clamp on it with vice grips and pull like
hell.  i ended up bending the backing plate however.  took quite an effort
to bend it back so that the drum wouldnt hit it.  next time i'll look a
little harder at the other  side to see if there is an easier way.
