I sent the last one too soon.

My feeling is that the smog referee will do a test first then issue you the
sticker. Not sure if you will get a sticker if you fail because I've never
done an engine swap.

Call the 800 number to make an appointment, get the smog referee's number,
then call them to find out the details.

Between steps 4 and 5 I would get a pre-test done first before going to the
ref.
