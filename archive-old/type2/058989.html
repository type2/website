Subject: Re: Cylinder head temp?

I talked to Mark Stephens about this.  I was happy when they said that they
recommended installing the temp sender at the FI temp sender location
(where I have it) rather than at the spark plug.  They said normal temps at
that location should be between 250-350 degrees.  I've heard other people
whos senders are at the plug say that they run ~100 degrees hotter than
that, so I think your temps are okay.

&gt;My question is, What is a normal operating temp. for the cylinder heads.
&gt;I have only had my bus a little while, and I installed a vdo head temp.
&gt;guage on the #3 cylinder.  BTW I have a 2liter 1979 westy. My average
&gt;temp. seems to be about 400-425 at 55mph and about 350 at idle.  Does this
&gt;seem normal.
