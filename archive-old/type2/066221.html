&gt;Sean Bartnik asked me about westy layouts.  I have seen a bunch throught

&gt;If y'all could help, I would love to get a complete list of the
&gt;split/loaf/brick interior options among the group members.

&gt;
&gt;Sean,

Long, detailed, and personalized.  I believe most people have never seen a
Westfalia &quot;Flip Seat&quot; - I've only seen one.   


1962 S034 &quot;Flip Seat&quot; interior - The cabinets are white formica.  I've been
told that the S035 is the same layout with brown wood grain formica and that
these layouts were available late '61 to late '63.
  

This Westfalia layout has the sleeping area in the front of the bus.  The
cab of the bus has a unique bench seat.  The bench seat back flips over to
form a bench seat facing the cargo area.  There is no bulkhead wall behind
the front seat between the cab and cargo area.
  
To sleep, the cab bench seat back is locked up and parallel to the seat
bottom.  Your feet go under the seat back into the cab area.  The rest of
the bed is formed using the cushions from the cargo bench seat which runs
the length of the cargo doors on the opposite side of the bus.

The table mounts to the cargo floor.  It can also mount outside the bus to
an adapter attached to the spare tire.  There is a folding chair that can be
mounted to the cargo floor using a winged bolt and a bracket.  The only
cabinet in the area from the cab to the back of the cargo doors is attached
to the forward cargo door.

There is a washbasin (no sink) in a cabinet mounted on the forward cargo
door.  The cabinet has two compartments.  The upper compartment opens up.
The inside of the door has a mirror that can be held open using a snap on a
leather strap.  The lower compartment opens down.  It is supported with two
chains and contains a plastic washbasin.  The washbasin can be filled using
water from three water jugs stored under the cargo bench seat.  The only
practical way to use the washbasin is with the cargo door tent attached and
the folding chair.  With the cargo doors open you can sit on the folding
chair inside the &quot;foyer&quot; tent and use the washbasin and mirror.

The clothes cabinet is on the passenger side behind the cargo doors.  Behind
it is a pots and pans cabinet that runs to the rear hatch.  The tent poles
are stored in a bag on top of these cabinets and are held in place by a
leather strap with a buckle. The tent canvas and two triangle pillows are
stored on top of the driver side cabinets.

The ice box and food cabinet are on the driver side.  There are also two
special cabinets on the drivers side facing the front of the bus.  The lower
cabinet is designed to hold two bottles of wine.   Above the wine cabinet is
a cupboard that holds six metal glasses or &quot;tumblers&quot; and a little hanging
light that plugs into a socket on the closet.  

The food cabinet is in the rear of the bus on the drivers side. The door
opens downward to form a cutting table.  The entire food cabinet is hinged
and has a little wheel that helps support it.  The cabinet and cutting board
can be used from inside the bus with the cabinet swung into the isle.  The
spare tire and table mount are stored behind the hinged food cabinet.  (A
Coleman lantern fits back here too. A Coleman two burner stove just fits
between the back of the cabinets and the rear hatch - I've never seen a
Westfalia stove so I don't know where it fits). 

There is a hide away and lift isle seat at the front of the isle between the
cabinets.  With the seat back down it looks like part of the isle.  With the
back up, it's a large seat for one between the cabinets. The seat pulls
forward about six inches on tracks and then lifts open on hinges.  This
gains access to the area I like to call the trunk.  The trunk is under the
isle seat.

There is no pop top.  These buses came with &quot;submarine&quot; hatches that are
useful for venting the bus but not much else.  If you don't have a tent
attached, getting in and out of bed can be a problem.  Your feet are under
the flip seat.  It's not easy to get your pants on laying down with your
feet under the seat back.  With the cargo doors closed, the area next to the
bed is tight.  The forward area is taken up by the bassinet cabinet and the
rear area by the folding chair.  Opening the cargo doors into the tent make
these problems go away.

Visibility while driving is a problem.  The stock '62 round side mirrors are
next to useless. I took the big rusty truck mirrors off two weeks ago. I
plan to pick up a pair of elephant ears before driving the bus again.  The
'62 tiny rear window is wide enough because the cabinets would block
anything wider but the window should be taller and/or lower.  You can't see
a small car right behind you through the rear window.  That may be why there
is no interior rear view mirror,  you couldn't use it anyway.

There is a child hammock that fits the front of the cab and there's plenty
of room for another child in the isle between the cabinets. My in laws were
the original owners and they fit a third kid on the floor under the bed.
I've had the bus since 1976. Camping in the bus is great but I've really
enjoyed using the bus on short trips as a picnic bus.  With the front seat
flipped into an extra bench seat,  the bus will seat six adults around the
table.  Seven if you seat someone in the folding chair and they don't mind
sharing a wine glass.

Steve
