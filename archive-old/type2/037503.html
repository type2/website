Subject: Re: Vanagon Engine Questions

Need to know a couple things here.... is it FI or carb(s)? What kind of
distributor? The thermostat is attached to the engine on the right side.
You have to take off the piece of tin that goes between the heat exchanger
and the engine and you will see it (or the holes where it should go) and yes
there should be a wire that goes from the thermostat around a wheel and up
through a hole in the tin to attach to the flaps.  Let me know about the
questions and I will probably be able to answer yours.

&gt; Should I be concerned:  1. I crankcase breather tube is hanging there.
&gt; Where does it go?  2. There is no cable running from the air flaps to
&gt; the thermometer.  Should there be?  Where is the thermometer?  3. The
&gt; timing is way off!!!  I set dwell to 48 and the idle is adjusted to 800
&gt; RPM.  I located the notch on the pulley.  Take out my light.  Not even
&gt; close!  20 BTDC.  I rotate the distributor . . . Idle drops . . . adjust
&gt; till I can't adjust anymore . . . stalls.  I then decide to take a
&gt; closer look at the distributor.  It appears that when I set the timing
&gt; statically the rotor arm is no where near terminal 1.  Is it possible
&gt; the the distributor driveshaft is incorrectly aligned?  I know there is
&gt; a lot here, but any suggestions would be helpful.
