&gt;there should be two cube-shaped boxes on the back of the fuse box. the
&gt;dimmer/headlight relay is the larger of the two boxes. according to bentley.

Thanx for all the info Joel. Since I do not hear a clicking sound I assume
my relay is defective (the dashboard lights dim briefly when I try to change
the lights from hi-lo) so assume it is making contacting and therefore is a
stuck relay.

I have checked all the fuses and they are okay.
