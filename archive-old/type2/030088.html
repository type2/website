&gt; I've sort of indicated to Rob a few times but I will to the rest, I don't
&gt; think HIOP is much of a secret.  As I think David or somebody
&gt; mentioned it simply involves the right parts at the right tolerances.
&gt; I'm pretty sure the 2.0 I did that is in Steve's '80 has fair numbers
&gt; and I actually ended up using a crank towards the small end but
&gt; which did meet spec.  

The numbers on Steve's engine (and I oughta know :-) are in the 20+ range
at idle, never seen it below 50 at speed.  In the winter, it pegs the
needle on a cold start, tho it settles into the 60-70psi range fairly
quickly. I have always run Castrol 20W-50, summer and winter. John keeps
telling me I oughta run thinner oil in the winter and he's right. Next
fall, I will definitely go to something lighter. I am also thinking of
changing over to a synthetic for the trip, which will have a much lower
initial viscosity.  We shall see.  Anyone making a 10W-50 in synthetic?

If John would just give up this fantasy of being a doctor (he's in his
second year of med school), or a rocket scientist (which he used to do), I
am *sure* we could keep him going in WV building great engines :-)  
Seriously, the engine is great. John is an expert machinist as a side
effect of building rockets for a living and it shows :-)
