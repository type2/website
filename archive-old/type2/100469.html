Subject: Recharging Gel Cell Batteries

Greetings List, and Happy Holidays!

Here's the scenario:

1969 Westy, Type 1 motor w/Generator. Have a cigarette lighter in the dash.

Have 2 wheelchair (gel cell, 32 amp) batteries under the jump seat, running 
in parallel (12 volt). From these I have an Aux lighter plug.

I have been running a &quot;two-headed&quot; (female-female) cigarette lighter plugged 
wire from dash cig lighter to Aux lighter periodically for 30 minutes to 
keep the Gel Cells  charged.

Good thing? Bad thing? So far (6 months with perhaps 20 chargings), so good. 
The Aux batteries haven't exploded or anything yet.

BTW - my starting battery is a Group 27 Deep Cycle.

Advice?

Mike &amp; Itch
