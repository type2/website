&gt; So heres the deal, if you need some good heads for you Bus 1.8L carbed
will
&gt; give the biggest valves and command the highest price. 2.0L heads are high
&gt; also due to the lack of heads that are still good, most need welding. 1.7L
&gt; heads are often over looked and are cheap. The money you save will more
than
&gt; pay to have them opened up. You should have any heads cleaned up anyway.
The
&gt; heads I got have no EGR ports, some do, some don't.

Do NOT confuse these ports with EGR. THESE ARE NOT EGR PORTS! They are AIR
INJECTION PORTS.
EGR is Exhaust Gas Recirculation. Exhaust flows from the exhaust manifold
thru an EGR valve and then INTO the intake system to dilute the fuel mixture
in order to lower the combustion temps to lower NoX emissions.
Air injection is fresh air that is injected INTO the exhaust near the ports
to complete the burn in order to lower HC.
