&lt;&lt;  I don't have welding equipment or skills.

Does anyone have any advice on how to fix these holes without taking out
the entire floor and welding a new one in?  The rest of the floor is
fairly solid with a little surface rust with which I can deal, but these
2 holes have me stumped.  Thanks, Greg
 &gt;&gt;

Since it's a floor and not that large a hole, I'd give the Eastwood Co.
website a look...They've got a body panel repair kit that uses a bond-
ing agent instead of welding. I know that auto manufacturers use 
bonding to put some car parts together, now, but I'm not at all up
on whether these DIY repairs work/last...Any real bodyshop work-
ers have any experience with bonding??
