Subject: Re: [Re: [T2] westy vs. campmobile question]

Now watch out guys - i'm at least one person who is guilty of 'camperizin=
g' a
kombi.

I'd say a rule of thumb is that if you've got a std headliner with 'oh sh=
!t'
handles, then your bus has been camperized by a previous owner.

I prefer the hardtop westy over the pooptop.
None of the rotten canvas/bad seals/dingy fiberglass/loss of heat issues.=

I guess I have a '76 hardtop westy as well, as I have all the gear mentio=

above, sans hardtop. I always thought it was ripped out of a westy (popto=

and stuffed in my kombi.
