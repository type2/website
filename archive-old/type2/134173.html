is it worth the effort??

do you have the skills needed???



those are the real questions&quot;



For the record:

I traded all my auto stuff for all the standard stuff - even the flywheel
and clutch - so as far as $$$$ it was minimal. As far as skills, yes I had
worked on other cars - mostly GM and Chrysler - but this was my first VW.
Bentley and I became fast friends. Was it worth it? It was for me. I had fun
and I learned a lot. As a teacher, I had the summer off, so time wasn't an
issue. I agree that this isn't for the faint of heart, but it's not like you
need an engineering degree to pull it off.
