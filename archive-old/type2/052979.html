I know the feeling - I had purchased my bus in April
of last year - took her out for a spin - was learning
how to drive her(I was not familiar with stick) -
thought it would be a fine idea to make some adjusts -
run her a little richer, change the plugs. Everything
seemed fine.  Only had her for about a month - decided
it would be fun to take her to the VW Show at the VW
headquarters (I only lived about 40 miles away from
there) and she decided to blow a cylinder or
something. I haven't had the funds to do major engine
work - all the mechanics keep saying it'll be at least
2grand.  It broke my heart.  I finally have an
opportunity to fix her up and plan on doing so.
