 I bought a '64 delivery van that has been upgraded with a
 non-(dys)functional 9-pin box controlling the signals/flashers.  There don't
 seem to be any replacements out there.  Does anyone have experience
 replacing this system with a conventional flasher?
 
 Appreciate any help.
  &gt;&gt;

look at the wiring diagram at vintagebus_dot_com for your year bus.  Rearrange 
the wiring so it matches the diagram.  You will need a 3 prong blinky relay 
for the turn signals.  The e flashers use a 4 prong relay.   which I am not 
sure what to use for the 12V conversion.   My 65 has one, and the e flashers 
are intermittant, and the turn signals faster one way than the other.
