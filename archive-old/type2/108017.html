Subject: RE: [T2] FTE brand m/c

&gt; has anybody heard of an FTE brand (master cylinder), made in 
&gt; germany? ATE is all i know about.


It's a good product. FTE is the German company formerly known as FAG,
and is an OEM supplier to VW.  Currently under the ownership of the huge
multinational Dana Corp. (which includes about 30 auto parts brands such
as Beck/Arnley, Borg Warner, Raybestos, Wix Filters, and Victor Rienz).
Most of these brand have retained their own operations, identity, and
manufacturing, and such is the case with FTE.  They remain the same as
when they carried the FAG name, and are comparable to ATE (which,
incidentally, is now part of Continental Rubber).
