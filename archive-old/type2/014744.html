Subject: Weber IDF carbs on a 68-71 Bus.

X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Has anyone ever run a Single IDF center mount on a 68-71 Bus? Is there room
for the carb and aircleaner? Did the carb work good in the Bus? The reason I
ask is that they are the same price as the Kadrons and you get a Weber with
dual 40 or 44mm. The one concern I have is the hight, I do not know if they
will hit.
