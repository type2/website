Subject: [T2] I think I'm in DEEP do-do! (long)

Hi guys, just got back from the Slough swap meet &amp; I got some great parts! I
also realized that I'm the brown smelly stuff right up to my neck.

My local VW garage Terry's in London generously gave me a 1300cc lump to
strip for parts, he also gave me a good upright case TOTALLY stripped. It
had been drilled for a full flow oil filter/cooler system, he sent it have
to bores machined out to 90.5mm for 1776cc &amp; line boring if needed. The case
has come back &amp; it only cost me the £90 charge from the machinist! Great,
but this is where the pooh sets in.

The case is German has 8mm head/oil pump bolts &amp; 10mm oil galleries all
great, BUT I have just noticed that it has NO rear mountings, not even the
castings that I could get machined with a thread! The case has very few
markings but is grey alloy not shiny magnesium. The full numbers on the side
of the sump are:-

23  (vw)  111.101.101 B
other side
10  (vw)  111.101.102 B


Any help in identifying this case (not in my books) is appreciated. Also, as
I understand there are adapter kits that ft onto the oil pump to put this in
a bus, but will I be able to run a full flow pump cover with this in place?

HELP!!!!!!!
