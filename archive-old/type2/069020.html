I started this thread so I'll put in my 2 cents of why does this happen

The air is sucked through the carb which causes it to reduce in 
temperature. Particularly on a cold and damp day this may lead to
input manifold icing also the damp air will effect the ability of the
cold air to carry the fuel - 100% humidity cannot be exceeded!

Recognising that hot air can carry a greater vapour load than cold air
(thats why clouds form where it's cold) VW did two things...

1. They put a manifold heater tube between the output of #4 and #2. If
   this is blocked or not working correctly then there will be no /
   reduced preheat from this source. I changed exhausts to an after
   market stainless muffler which may not have the correct plumbing
   (see Bob Hoovers Sermon on this)

2. They allowed the air going into the air filter to be heated via the 
   magic flap.

If both are working thats great! but on that cold damp day you may/will
stall if either or both are not working.
- - a lot off depends on the climate where you live - hot/cold dry/damp!!!

I don't think the standard/009 distributor argument has anything to do 
with it.
