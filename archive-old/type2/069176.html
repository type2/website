James Matta rote:

&gt;        I was watching CNBC and caught a segment on a guy who is a
&gt;fanatical lunchbox collector. He
&gt;had a metal microbus lunchbox. I couldn't believe it. It looked pretty
&gt;cool. Anyone out there have
&gt;one?
&gt;
I don't have one, but I'd sure like to. For anyone who is interested, this
guy has a Web site. Check it out at:

It features a pic of the bus lunch box at:

This guy is really out to lunch ...
