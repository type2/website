Subject: Re: [T2] Help refurbing F. I. harness

&gt; I use a small, straightened paper clip and push it into the little slot
&gt; beside the metal prongs on the end that faces the injector.
&gt;
&gt; Does this help? I could probably go into more detail if needed.
&gt;

That's exactly what I needed. I actualy got this figured out before I read 
your post but thanks for the reply. I used a jewlers screwdriver. Put it in 
the slot and turned it so the blade would move the keeper. Worked great. Had 
to run up to the hardware store to get a can of spray paint to make a black 
connector turn green. One too many broken connectors.

Does anyone know if there is supposed to be a tool for removing these 
connectors from the fuel injectors, etc. with out breaking them? Every time 
I get another bus I find several broken connectors.
