Hi all,
        I think it was Penn (of Penn and teller fame,
comic/magicians.  great act) who had a monthly column in some computer
magazine.  Anyway, he talked about a &quot;geek sport&quot; that included one of
these things.  You can get the parts to build one from Radio Shack (if
I remember, it was a few years ago, about $30 worth of parts?).  Any
way the game was a few people in cars would go out on the freeway with
these things and the object was to herd up a certain type of car (fast
fancy radar dector equiped car).  The goal being to get as many BMWs
or whatever in a group as you can by setting off their radar detectors
each time they try and speed away from the &quot;pack&quot;.

VW content?  Well what better shepard to lead the pack than an old VW
bus:)

take care all,
          brandy
