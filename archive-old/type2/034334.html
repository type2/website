Subject: Post rebuild maintenance

Hi,

I just bought a 78 westfalia with a rebuilt engine with only 200 miles on
it. I have always had type1 engines and am unfamilliar with type4's so I
need some pointers (I am a recent ex-split window owner). I called the
mechanic who built the engine and discussed the quality of the rebuild
before I bought the bus and was satisfied that he had done everything Tom
Wilson would have done. It had an oil change at 500 miles and I will change
it again immediately but I am wondering what else I should check or adjust.
This engine has hydraulic valves, which I have never had, so I am unsure if
&quot;Set 'em an' forget 'em&quot; applies to the break in period or if I should set
them again before forgetting them.

Any other break-in hints welcome.

Bob
