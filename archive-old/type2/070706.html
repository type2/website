I agree with you about the non North Americaness of the fixed window. 
Most of the buses I have seem that have full fixed glass in the cargo 
area have been Euro delivery buses as well as the ones that do not 
have the vent wing for the rearmost left window.

I had the window sticker for my old 69 DeLuxe and it listed the 3rd 
vent wind window as an option.



&gt;The 69 westy I sold to Nikki had fixed vent windows.Always thought it was a
&gt;euro thing because as far as I could figure out it was a german delivery.
