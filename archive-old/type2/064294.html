Subject: mea maxima starter relay culpa

Sheepish greetings all:

To the seasoned veterans--thank you for not snickering [where I could see
it, at least]; and to my fellow rookies: trust these people.  They know
their stuff and are generous about it. 

So thanks to Sean Bartnik, Bill Keating, and H. Steven Dolan, all whom
pointed out to me that there's a thread going on right now about doing a
starter circuit relay to solve the problem of having the thing not catch
when I hit the key--and all of whom also spelled out further detailed
advice.  Everything suggests that the problem is the power drop from the
long circuit loop between the battery, the fuse block, the ignition key,
and the starter.  Duh. 

[Two pieces of information I left out in my original description of the
problem because I hadn't learned yet to track them:  Yes, it happened more
when the engine (hence, starter and solenoid) were warm; and yes, it
happened after the first cool weather of autumn hit Portland OR.]

The killer is, I've been reading/thinking about that thread [and I read it
when it came up last spring on VANAGON-L, too], but for whatever reason it
didn't register that this was what I was abruptly facing. [I even have the
FAQ with Bob Hoover's sermon on &quot;steenking solenoids&quot; *in the bus.* I
don't even know the man, and I feel like I've offended his sensibilities. 
Sigh.]  For the sake of other rookies:  If you don't have the relay wired
in, and you're going to have temperature drops, is this just a regular
feature for all Type 2's, period? 

So anyway, on generous advice, I'm off tomorrow in search of a Bosch WR-1
relay, and a length of 10 guage wire, and a bunch of wire fasteners, and
some duct tape and a swiss army knife, and .... 

No, wait--that's McGuyver.  Never mind.

Thanks again to all.  

best
