&gt; Well, this is not entirely true..... in 1974 the Calif buses with auto trans
&gt; came with FI.

and the 411/412 type IV vehicles also came with fuel injection 

71-72   1700cc
73-74   1800cc

slightly different design fuel injection system, but the engines are
interchangeable in most parts 

  I used a 71 1700 as a drop in backup for my 2 liter 78 engine for many
years when I was working on the 2liter
