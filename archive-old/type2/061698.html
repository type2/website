&gt;I just got a '76 Westy ('Deluxe' says the for sale sign in the window,
&gt;but I'm not really sure how to determine if it really is or not


In '76-77, a Deluxe was green and a standard Westy was yellow.  The Deluxe
added a propane stove and tank, a city water hookup for the sink, a fridge
rather than an icebox, a front table, a matching woodgrain hinged cover that
closed over the sink/stove unit, a trash recepticle/bench-seat that sat
between the front seats, and a dual battery hookup.  All Westies from '76
onward had swiveling passenger seats, deluxe or not.
