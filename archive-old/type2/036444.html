Subject: Jumping

    I own a '91 Cutl**s Cie*a with 275, 000 miles.  Have jumped off vehicles
probably 40-50 times, and been jumped off at least 20. (no exaggeration)
Only electronics problem has been the control module for the ignition coils,
and it went out at around 190,000.  (common to go out at 100-120,000) Have
also changed batteries several times while vehicle was running.  I have had
to replace the alternator once or twice, but don't think thats bad for that
many miles.  Also have an '85 S-10, which has been boosted probably 35 of
the 40 or 50 times on the Cut**s-and I swap batteries with the bus weekly,
usually with engine running (on the truck)
