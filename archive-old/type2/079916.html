Subject: RE: [T2] Bus insurance

&gt; Bus content - anyone currently use American Collectors Insurance for
&gt; their bus?  They only want $51/year to insure a $3,000 bus (agreed value)
&gt; with no deductible, $300k liability, comp, collision, etc. and the only
&gt; restriction is that it not be a daily driver and no more than 2500 miles
per
&gt; year.  Maybe I can afford to keep a second bus after all... ?


I have my '78 Crew Cab and my Fiat 124 Spider insured as antiques through
Condon and Skelly (http://www.condonskelly_dot_com/ ). The actual coverage is
from Met Life.  The terms are basically the same as you noted above, plus
that the vehicles must be garaged. You have to send pictures of the vehicle
(which must be in &quot;original condition&quot;) in order to get coverage. The price
is also extremely cheap, I think around $85 a year per car in my area
(versus about $600-700 for conventional insurance).   I have never had a
claim so I can't comment on how they are in that regard, but at least Met
Life is a nationally known insurance company for whatever that's worth.
