Subject: RE: Heat and Friction: an Experiment

        Aw come on Thom, we're having fun. At least I am...
Goodness, you don't think anyone BELIEVED the tripe I was
posting do you ??? :)

        All you jr. Physicists out there can ammuse yourself
by stretching a rubberband, letting it return to room temp
(pause 10 seconds) and then allowing to to contract.
        Extra points if you can guess what temperature it
will be after it contracts BEFORE doing the experiment.

        Seriously. the primary source of heat in a VW engine
is combustion of fuel-air mixture. Really. All of 0.11ml
liquid fuel every 8.77 inches traveled at 60mph &amp; 17mpg.
I don't personally advise coasting down hill in gear with
the gas off, but if some science minded type does it
WITH THE GAS DISCONNECTED FROM THEIR CARB!! they'll find
the engine isn't HALF as warm at the bottom as if they
coast in neutral with the engine idling.
        Coasting in gear with ignition off and carb hooked
up will pump fuel vapor through the engine, which in a cold
engine will be bad since it will condense on the cyliner walls
and dilute the oil.
