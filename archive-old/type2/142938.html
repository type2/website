Subject: Re: Why not to live in pretentious neighborhoods

Thanks for the comments and support everybody!

Two things I should mention:
#1: I live in an apartment. This makes things sticky. Heck, I don't
even know where all the DOORS are around here! Everybody uses their
garages to get into the apartment.

#2: I felt bad for jumping down the cop's throat. But in my defence,
his first comment was, &quot;you don't live here do you?&quot; That right there
was enough to set me off. Heck, my salary is probably higher than 90%
of the tenants. The only reason I'm always broke is because my wife
can't work so my salary supports a family of 4.
