Subject: Re:: Need a Drivers side R. Bumper Bracket ('72)

I have a 72 Riviera and I've seen a couple different bumpers on '72's at the
junkyard.  Mine has the bolt on upright bumper thingies:
    
       ___                ___
 __    | |                | |     __
 \ \___| |________________| |____/ /
  \    | |                | |     /
   \___| |________________| |____/
       ---                ---
    Thingy               Thingy
 
Others I've seen at the boneyard don't or their bumper is completely
different.  I could look into getting one from the yard for you if you want.
Where do you live and what precisely are you looking for?  A whole bumper or
just the bracket?

&gt; I do believe the 72 bumpers are the same as the 68-71. The bumpers
&gt; changed to the square ones in 73. The rear brackets are interchangeable
&gt; at the frame (I have a 68-72 bumper on the rear of 73) but the 73-on
&gt; front is totally different (as I learned when I was going to get a front
&gt; bush-basher from Dr. Pepper's 72).

&gt;&gt; Hey all-
&gt;&gt; My next project is to get the bumper on.
&gt;&gt; Missing the Drivers Side and I believe the 72 is different from all
&gt;&gt; the rest is it not?
