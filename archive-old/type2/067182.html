Subject: Gas heater

Some time ago I corresponded with a gentleman here on this list
about buying a gas heater. He said he had &quot;scads of them laying around&quot;.
The drawback was that all his heaters were for pre- T4. I told him 
that I would look elsewhere. Whoever you are PLEASE contact me!!!!
Thanks...Chip
