Subject: RE: smoked alternator

hey now,

i didn't find it hard to change the alternator in my fiancee's '77 westy.
it took about 2hours or so. of course, i had an experienced mechanic to ask
questions. but really, even, if i didn't, it's not that hard. i don't know
about a '69, but on the '77, i just had to take off the belt, front and right
side engine tin, and the oil funnel. then you undo the bolts on the alternator.
you have to get behind the alternator for the long one...it's a tight fit
but you can reach the nut..it's a 13mm i believe. loosen that and take it
off. now you can remove the alternator. take off the back cover...and note
or write down how it's hooked up. write it down! you don't want to burn out
your new one by hooking it up wrong. then disconnect the alternator. it's a
tight fit but you can get it out. then just reinstall the new one, and hook
everything back up.

MAKE SURE YOU DISCONNECT THE NEGATIVE CABLE OF YOUR BATTERY!!! i disconnected
both just to make sure.

this is a very general posting of this procedure. the usual disclaimers apply.
if you need more detailed email me and i'll try to send you a better one.

but it's not all that hard.
