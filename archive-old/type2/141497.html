Subject: &gt;Subject: Re: [T2] 1975 westy gas tank filler, replacement
  sequence

Geez!  Just bought my 3rd 78 camper and am smelling fuel all the time!
Think it's due to some Oregon thing (I live there/here too)?

I sold the last two campers some time ago, but won't make the same mistake
again!!!  Have cried and regretted it for years.  As the saying goes, &quot;You
never realize how much you love something until it's gone.&quot;  Sooooo true!!!!

By the way... was surfing the Internet one evening and found a site where a
fellow had detailed plans on how to build a storage/trash compartment for
the center cab (he didn't want to pay $200 for a replacement).  Looked
pretty good, but haven't been able to find the site since (named his bus
&quot;Po&quot;?).  Doh!!  Should have bookmarked it since I would like one too!!

Great memories of college friends sitting in the &quot;center&quot; as we drove
through forest service roads looking at the redwood forest!  Oh... those
were the days!  Must be having a mid-life crisis....

&gt;&gt; Here in Oregon, we are `not allowed` to pump our own
&gt;&gt;gas.  So I cannot provide the TLC needed to prevent
&gt;&gt;damage to the rubber filler neck during refueling.  As
&gt;&gt;a result, my 78 fuel filler neck gets damaged
&gt;&gt;(perforated) about twice a year, by careless
&gt;&gt;entry-level gas station employees.  I know its damaged
&gt;&gt;when a strong gasoline smell hangs about the bus cabin
&gt;&gt;while driving (as the gasoline is jostling about).
