almost every time, it's a vacuum leak between the intake and head.

also, not many people know this, but if you install new points, they &quot;break
in&quot; and this retards the timing about 4 degrees, in the first 100 miles or
so. Don't forget to lube them with DISTRIBUTOR GREASE.

Well adjusted the valves again, a little loose.   fired right up on the
first turn. But, still seemed sluggish.

did balance test...................died when pulled 3 or 4 wire, but ran the
same when one or two was removed.

So I put a plug on the end of the 0ne and two wire and ran started the car
to test for spark.  Yup.  Spark was present.  Hooked the wires back up, and
sprayed brake clean around the bottom of the intake manifold on 1 &amp; 2 ...no
change in idle.

I am at a loss here..........I was anal in my assembly of this motor.
