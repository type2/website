boy, that sounds familiar. :)

&gt; 1. One of the exhaust studs is missing. Local VW FLAPS told me it's an 8x9mm
&gt;    stud. He doesn't stock them. I pulled one from a spare 1.8l that I have
&gt;    and it's 8x8mm, but when I put it in the head it's loose. Would that be
&gt;    because the hole is stripped or did some heads really come with 8x9mm

On my 2L the exhaust studs are 8x9. Are you sure that the stud you
pulled out is still a 8x8?
