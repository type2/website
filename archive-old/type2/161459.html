Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof in a Bay westy bus

Hi Timo,

I guess I wasn't very clear in my earlier post.  I don't want a  
sunroof in the luggage rack, and I don't want to replace my pop-top.  
I was thinking about installing a skylight into the fiberglass of the  
westy roof. My Dad's 85 westy has a small clear vent in this  
location, and the 82 westy my parents had before that has a larger  
webasto sunroof installed in the pop-top. The extra light and  
ventilation are a definite plus.

Here's a vanagon syncro with a small roof vent:

Here's a eurovan with a big glass sunroof on the pop-top:

&gt; Hello Greg, you asked about putting a sunroof in a Westfalia. I have
&gt; done this in my 1971 ex- westfalia. The early bay westfalias had the
&gt; track for the sliding metal sunroofs, so I found one at one of the  
&gt; used
&gt; parts places and mounted it up.  &lt;SNIP&gt;
