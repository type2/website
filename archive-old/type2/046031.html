Subject: [T2] Re: Wires and connectors

[...]

The offending wire and spade connector were assembled at the BOSCH factory.
They don't appear to be soldered, and a check of several identical used and
new assemblies confirms no evidence of solder  -  just factory crimped.

The wire did not come out of the terminal.  It broke at the point where the
wire enters the spade connector.

This was a new condenser/lead assembly, installed ~14,000 miles ago.  In all
the years I've mucked about with air-cooled VWs I've never seen a similar
failure.  Is this another evidence of the declining quality of BOSCH parts?

&gt;&gt;  All of those wires really should be soldered to their respective spade
connector.  I nearly &quot;bought it&quot; one dark night on a freeway 'cuz a wire
broke loose.  It scared me pretty badly.  &lt;&lt;
