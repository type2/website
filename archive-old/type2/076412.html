Subject: RE: [T2] The 232,000mi bus lost a clutch cable!


This thread brings to mind an embarrasing moment with a safety tip.
If you carry a spare clutch cable, carry the adjuster nut as well. Mine
broke at that end, dropping the nut and threaded bit on the road somewhere
way back in the desert. We worked it out, but it could have been easier....
