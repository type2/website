&gt; I realise that we have wandered off of the practical path here. If you want
&gt; a modify you van to be highway cruiser, go for it, but theoretically  isn't
&gt; cooling of a Volks engine also a function of the speed of the fan? (ie:
&gt; higher engine rpm=higher fanspeed=more cooling air?) Wouldn't asking the
&gt; engine to create more torque (more output, thus more waste heat) at a lower
&gt; RPM and reducing the amount of cooling air cause the engine to run hotter?

unfortunately there appears to be a practical maximum amount of air that
can be pushed thru the cooling ducts, beyond that little additional
cooling seems to take place, on a type IV engine this seems to be between
55-60mph for a stock setup.
