Hi again,

&gt;     Yeah, well VW has a vested interest in selling more cars. And in
&gt; keeping their dealers busy fixing old ones. VW doesn't tell you the
&gt; correct scoop on lots of stuff, like how often to adjust the valves on
&gt; solid lifter engines. Muir does. 

 I think you're being too hard on VW and giving
Muir a bit too much credit, but that's just my
opinion, obviously.
 I blew an engine by following Muir's advice on
setting the timing- now I am a lot more skeptical.

 I'm sure no-one would disagree that it's useful
to get a range of views- Ultimately you have to
make up your own mind what to do. All I'd like
to do is to point out to anyone who's less
experienced (as I was) that Muir's advice to
switch off your brain and just follow the 
procedures is unsound. He didn't (and 
couldn't) cover all eventualities.
 I should have realised this then and  hopefully 
this will help others to avoid the problems I had,
which is what this list is all about, after all.

Cheers,
              W.
