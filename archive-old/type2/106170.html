Subject: Front tire mount.

Hi All,

Reading the post on nose repair made me remember I had a question for this
area of the Bus. I have the holes up front for the tire mount on my 70 Westy,
and I picked one up last year to mount there. I took off the inside kick
panels, mine are wood, to get access to the front from behind. I didn't have
much time to work at it, but I could not see how to get at the area where the
mount goes. Can anyone describe the procedure?

Thank you

-Jeff
