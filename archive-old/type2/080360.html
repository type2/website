&gt; isnt the speedo marked in both mph and km? Just looked at my 77 US spec and
&gt; its marked in both? Also looked at my 69 and 72 Can spec buses didnt see a
&gt; whole lot of dif in the brake warning lights. I know in the reverse
&gt; situation when I imported my US spec chev astro to Canada, the only thing I
&gt; had to change was to add DRL's. The speedo was already marked in both. If
&gt; you've got a knit picker, do what some have sugested and junkyard a light
&gt; and speedo.
