Subject: Fw: New spare part productions for our eBay auctions, samples

Although this vendor operates on a forbidden web site, I thought it of 
interest to the group the fact that he offers to manufacture NLA parts. I 
follow his listings because he travels to germany regularly and brings parts 
to his Santa Ana warehouse. In fact if you follow his link below, you will 
notice some NOS bus parts currently available. I thought of Don's tail light 
episode when I saw them listed.

Subject: New spare part productions for our evay auctions, samples


Hello

We are looking for new items to sell on evay.
If you don't find some spare parts or accessories for older vehicles, or if 
these are to expensive, please note that we can make small series and sell 
them in our auctions.
Or sell only for you on special order.
I can take samples on Sunday 10/24 with me to Europe and check for 
availability and for the production cost.

Martin
