Subject: [T2] dizzy 180 out Question

Kia ora, greetings folks
Just curious about a run of exhaust valve failures we had a few motors ago.
Question:  If a dizzy was set up 180 degrees out on a 72 1600, would that
mean that the #3 retard cam action be occuring instead for the #1, and if so
what would be the likely adverse outcome?
