&gt; '74-75
&gt; 
&gt; I do not believe that the '74/5 Westy settup would have had rotating seats
&gt; as it had the stove cabinet mounted behind the passenger and the sink
&gt; mounted behind the driver, but have not owned one.  They might.

--&gt;  My '75 has the metal walls behind the seats (the cabinets are bolted
to them) and most certainly doesn't have rotating seats. ;)  Did the
metal walls exist in passenger buses too, or were they an extra
reinforcement to make up for the big honkin' hole in the roof of the
Westy?
