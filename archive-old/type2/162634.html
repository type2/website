&gt; Hello Bob  Crane number is XR700-0226   coil is standard  bosch blue coil.
&gt; It is a CDI unit has an LED lite on it showing current  when on. You can open
&gt; the plug gaps to about .035  have a cool one on  me  later  Mark Dearing

finally ended up putting in the Crane XR3000-0231   seems to work pretty
well when I finally got it adjusted right, still hard starting but I don't
think that is the Crane suspect I may have  jiggled the cold start valve
wires loose

thanks for the help

Bob
