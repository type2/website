Subject: Re: getting engine onto the jack

In my youth I weighed 128 lbs and did my 71 camper engine all alone. 
Here is the secret to get the jack(s) under it (using leverage):  Push
the engine in place under the bus.  Get some 8x16x4 inch concrete &quot;cap&quot;
blocks or a bunch of 2x6 lumber pieces about 10&quot; long.  Using a prybar
(see garden dept of Home Depot) or a piece of yellow pine decking (1x6&quot;
at least 6' long) levered over top of a block and udner the heaterbox,
lever up one side of the engine and slide in a 4&quot; block under the inside
side of the heaterbox.  Go to otherside and do the same.  Repeat,
depending on the height you need, stacking your shims as you go.  When I
had no jack, I then slid in my engine board on top of broomstick pieces,
stood 2 scissors on it centered around the oil strainer plate, and
jacked it up until I could center the engine using the rollers and taps
with a LARGE sledge hammer.  Lying under the bus and watching the
transhaft, I could center
the engine by just tapping on the sides of the board.
