Subject: 10 worst cars per &quot;Car Talk&quot;

I just got back from running errands in Lurch whilst listening to Car Talk on 
the radio.  They read the list of the 10 worst cars of the millennium 
starting with #10 which was (you guessed it) the VW Bus.  The usual comments 
were offered up (legs as crumple zones, being blown over by sidewinds, no 
heat), but I suppose I am sort of proud of this dubious distinction.  I love 
my bus.  Other cars listed were -- well, you can log onto &lt;A 
HREF=&quot;http://cartalk_dot_cars_dot_com/Contents/sitemap.html&quot;&gt;Car Talk&lt;/A&gt; to get the 
lowdown.
