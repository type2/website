The bus has just over 1500 miles on a rebuild. Until recently cold start
worked just fine. First starts would crank right up and idle. The first stop
sign would result in a stall however. This was not too anoying because the
next stop would usually be Ok and idle would be fine there after. What was
wierd however was that subsequent starts would have idle difficulties again
until I drove a little and then no problem.
Recently I loaned the bus to my brother and he took it to the mountains.
Upon return, cold start is not working, and idle only works after driving a
bit - 2nd - 4th stop on a trip. I have checked timing, electrical
connections, cold start connection ( I will check this again) all fine. I
also attempted to adjust idle and fuel air screws to the best I could. Any
suggestions would be appreciated
