Subject: Re: [T2] S boot redesign

My S boot was in poor shape ten years ago, and so was every other S  
boot I examined in the bone yards around San Diego. So let's talk 20  
years rather than thirty years.

This question would be moot if VW were still producing spares of the  
boot, which they aren't, of course. So this is a part that has proven  
itself (1) to need replacement, and (2) for which an adequate  
replacement is not available.

While the boot may have provided the AFT some degree of isolation  
from shock and vibration when new and pliable, the fact that the  
boots are now generally cracked demonstrates that boots have been  
inadequately flexible for some time. Have the AFTs suffered as a  
result? Loss of performance or of durability? That's a real question,  
not a rhetorical one.

(The cracks, of course, restore some degree of flexibility to the boot.)

I'm going to go back to what I said yesterday: based on (now) thirty  
years of experience with FI, it ought to be possible to sit down and  
redesign the entire system, so as to obviate all possibility of leaks  
(and lean running). Megasquirt, of course, is a help.
