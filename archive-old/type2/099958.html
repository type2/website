Subject: tick tick tick while driving

I've been driving the CA highways for a week now and besides the bumps and gas consumption I'm not used to the bus is starting to make a few new noises which I assume are temperature related because it's only a little colder here than Austin. ;-)  One I think is in the rubber boot for the clutch pedal going thru the floor.

Anway, I've noticed a tick tick tick noise while driving and I know it's not from a rock in the tire and my wheel bearings were replaced by me recently and there is no play there so while driving to work to today it occurred to me that it's probably the speedo cable since the noise is in time with driving speed.

What's the best way to lubricate this cable?  Remove it and grease it or pour something down?
