Subject: Engine fire advice?

Recently I purchased a complete engine that had been in a fire for $50 at a 
local junk yard. The reason I bought it is because it is the correct engine 
for my 72 westy. My intention is to either rebuild it or even try to get it 
running. But before I do anything I was wondering if anyone has any &quot;does 
and don'ts&quot; on tackling such a project? The case seems to be solid (i.e. no 
apparent cracks).

thanks in advance for your advise. Phil.
