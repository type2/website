&gt; &gt; Shawn,

&gt; &gt; The list wisdom on 009's is to time them at 28 BTDT at 2500-3000RPM.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My wisdom on 009's is to time it by tossing it and getting a vac advance
&gt; &gt; dist.  This is a personal opinion... I don't like them and toss them at
&gt; &gt; any opportunity :-)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; If you can't find the stocck
&gt; &gt; dist, then the dist used on '76-79 buses is a good universal replacement
&gt; &gt; and times at 7.5 BTDC at idle (800-1000)
