Subject: Re: [T2] Changing Muffler on 2cc 76 drivetrain

Hi,

Now I have yet another use for that dental mirror I
just acquired...
The mechanic did a great job putting in the new
set-up, kept it as &quot;stock&quot; as possible. But I haven't
checked to see if the CC is installed.  I never need
to do a emissions check in WA state since it's a 72.

&gt; changed.  I can see two bolts on the bottom of the
&gt; right side. So I figure there is one on top.&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Time ot get on your old clothes, get out a
&gt; flashlight and small mirror and go look and be sure.
&gt; Never assume the mechanic did the right thing...
&gt; &lt;grin!&gt; You too can be more than a tune-up mechanic.
&gt; First step is learning where everything is.
