&gt; Is there anyplace that sells a general box of replacement metric fasteners

I've seen a bag of bolts sold for beetle but can't remember where. Not sure
how useful it would be anyway.

Back in Austin, I used to go to Lowe's. Their fastener section was well
organized and they labeled bols by coating (steel, zinc, stainless) and by
grade (5, 8, metric 8.8 9.8 etc). Now the nearest one is an hour away and I
dearly miss it.

Is Lowe's a far drive for you?

Home Depot specializes in confusing labeling of gradeless bolts. Avoid!

Just before I left Austin, a new hardware store opened up that carried the
Hillman line of fasteners. A great selection of metric and I miss it also.

Give them a call and see if they know of a store in your area they stock:

Hopefully someone will also chime in with a good reference for Augusta.
Otherwise search the fastener section of the phonebook.

&gt; (Richard, your package got here today.  I'll try the regular resins, but the
&gt; new one coming out soon may work better.  I've got a sample to try it with.
&gt; I'll let you know how it works out.)

I hear it is inclement this time of year in Leningrad.
