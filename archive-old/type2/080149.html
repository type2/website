Subject: Re: [T2] Stud removal

Snoopy sends:

&gt; Ok I know this has been asked before but my ex mechanic just told me something
&gt; that I do not trust... AS he just sold me the wrong size stud...  I think he's
&gt; out to get me but...one of the studs that comes out of the heads broke barely
&gt; but just enough that I can't get a nut on it.  So I am trying to remove. Not
&gt; budging.  My ex mechanic said to use a torch to loosen the aluminum...  Is
&gt; this right, if so how much?

I would take this to a machinist. They have ways to deal with this.
