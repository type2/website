Subject: Re: [T2] IT RUNS!!!!!!...........but doesn't

&gt; If it is running lean, it will &quot;pop-pop-pop&quot; thru the carb.
&gt;

Yup. And running lean can mean either too little fuel or too much air.

The thing that plagued my rebuild and eventually solved the issue was
remembering the AIR part of the combustion equation: the spark plugs
indicated she was running very lean. We troubleshooted with air in mind from
that point on, and we ultimately found that part of the 'professional'
portion of the rebuild had not been tightened down properly. She had a MAJOR
air leak at the intake manifold on one side... that gasket wasn't even
compressed. No amount of carb or timing adjustment was going to change that.

There were other issues, sure, but that was the big one, and it made the
difference between barely running (pop! POP! stall.) and running well. It
was also bloody easy and cheap to fix.
