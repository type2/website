Subject: re: [T2] Hydraulic lifters for '75 1.8...question

&gt;The short answer is that you can just pop the new lifters in with the
&gt;regular cam, push rods, and rocker arm springs, and it'll work just
&gt;fine.  Many have had success with this.  But why spring for new lifters
&gt;if you are not going to use a new cam?  Setting valves is not that big a
&gt;deal.  Save that $$ for the real problems you *will* have, I'd say.

IMO hydraulic lifters are a great investment.  Hydraulics keep your valve
train in perfect adjustment.  You can't do as well by checking the valve
lash every 3k miles, or 300 miles, or even every 3 miles.  The hydraulics
do the same thing continually.  What's more, on a type IV, popping the
valve covers is a PITA.  Changing to hydraulics is one of the best
modifications I even made to my bus, and I guess every single auto
manufacturer agrees with me, since all new cars these days have hydraulic
lifters.  They also all have some other improvements that have shown to be
worth their cost and complexity, such as fuel injection and electronic
ignition.  Arguing against such substantial improvements on the basis of
cost or engine longevity just doesn't make sense.
