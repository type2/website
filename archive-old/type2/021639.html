Subject: Re: [T2] knoking when clutch is down

Is this an urgent situation ( ie can it cause furthure damage)or can it
go until
it wears out.
Ok well I have never pulled the engine out before, but I have read some
of the
posts here and I have a friend that has some experience, so I think I
will have a
go at it, It makes sense to go with the clutch kit as well having gone
through the
hassle of the engine pull.

&gt; You can diagnose it by the symptoms, which you reported.  You can verify
&gt; your diagnosis by replacing the throwout bearing and seeing if the noise
&gt; goes away.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, engine has to come out.  If you are unsure about the condition of
&gt; your clutch you may want to purchase a clutch kit and replace that while
&gt; you're in there.  The throwout bearing itself is about $10 and of course a
&gt; clutch kit is considerably more.
&gt;
&gt; So the procedure is:
&gt;
&gt; Step 1:  remove engine :-)
&gt;
&gt; After that it's easy, just unclip the throwout bearing from the cross
&gt; shaft and clip the new one in, then reinstall the engine.

&gt; &gt; thanks for your reply to my problem Sean.
&gt; &gt; Do you know the procedure or where I can get some info on how to replace and
&gt; &gt; or diagnose that it is the throwout bearing.If it is I assume the engine has
&gt; &gt; to come out.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; help  and advice appreciated.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds like the throwout bearing needs to be replaced.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a 73 2 ltre camper ,it started about 3 weeks ago and seems to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; getting louder as time goes on , also i noticed that the knocking sound
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is now apparent even when the clutch is out.I am wondering if my clutch
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is due for renewal or the flywheel going out , any info on what might be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; causing this sound would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thnx in advance
