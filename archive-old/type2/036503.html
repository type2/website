Peter-
At this time I am trying to solve the same problem. People on the list tell
me that I need to replace the pressure sensors on the master cylinder. If a
sensor failed wouldn't the light just stop working or stay on all the time?
I'd like to figure out how to test them. Do the sensors sense all the time?
Why doesn't the light go on when your foot is off the pedal (no pressure)?
How do the sensors know when to sense?
I have some time later today and it is getting warmer and I will start
experimenting and looking for bad connections.
I'll let you know what I find.
If you figure it out please send a note.
Anyone else have any ideas?
