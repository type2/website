Subject: Re: [T2] propane powered type2's - any further info on this?

You could do what I'm doing for a &quot;green&quot; and cheap fuel conversion, I'm
putting a Mercedes diesel in a splitty and running it on used fryer oil.

&gt; Thanks for the info Dave, I'm going to keep checking into this, it's very
&gt; interesting to me, and since it's less polluting as well as half the price,
&gt; how can we lose??
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Courtney

&gt; The guys on the megasquirt list have discussed it off and on...and I
&gt; believe that someone actually did it....
