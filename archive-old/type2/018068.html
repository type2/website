Subject: Disc Brake Residual Pressure Valve
Message-ID: &lt;37421529.1D1C09B8_at_dolphinsci_dot_com&gt;

Does one of these exist in the brake system of a '78 Bus.  I have looked
throughout the Bentley manual to and cannot find anything relating to
this.  These things are put in line to the front disc to maintian some
level of minimum pressure on the front discs.  2 psi is a typical valve
value.  I am aware of the porportioning valve that is between the front
and rear and it is separate from the one that I am inquiring about.

Any ideas?
Does anybody have a brake system diagram for the '78 bus?

Thanks

Scott
