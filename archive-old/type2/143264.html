Subject: What I learned today...

Taking the heads and such off with the engine in isn't that big a deal.
93mm 1800 cylinders are NOT the same as 94mm 2.0 cylinders. (Ok, shoulda
checked.)
Welding a nut to a stud with an arc welder is not as easy as it sounds when
you're 20 years out of practice.
Don't weld when there's a carb cleaner soaked piece of cardboard nearby.
A fire extinguisher is handy to have around.
A Starbucks Venti White Mocha is nice when you're frustrated.
