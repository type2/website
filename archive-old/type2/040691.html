Subject: Trolley Jack

I'm looking to buy a trolley jack, and I most such things are rated at
2-tons, others are available at extra cosst (2.5 ton or 3.0 tons).   I'm
thinking that any of these would do (although, undoubtably I'll get what I
pay for too...)

But the *real* purpose of my question is about the length of the lifting
arm.  Some of these seem really quite short - about 18 inches (~ 0.5 metres)
Is this sufficient for must purposes on a stock height bus ?

Any recommendations ?
