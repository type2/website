I just purchased a 1982 VW Westfalia camper and the original instruction
book 
was a little  vague about how to light and start the stovetop.  The tank was

filled and the valve opened, but the burner knobs are locked so they won't 
turn open.  Also, this might be related, but the refridgerator on the gas 
positon is not working either.  can you help.

   Thank you, Jim Barden
