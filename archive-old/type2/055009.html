Subject: Re: Missing Distributor Spring

Brian,
I know that you are already getting an 009, but if I may ask, why?  Is
there something wrong with your vacuum advance distributor.  If your
vacuum one isn't working, it is easy to fix it and I have an article
that describes how to get it back into shape.  If you fully understand
why you are doing this, then that's great, but if you look at the
library notes regarding an 009, there are a few drawbacks to making the
switch.  The vacuum advance design is a well though-out design and I
would do some research before switching (if you haven't already, of
course).

Any other thoughts on this, fellow listers?

Mike

&gt; Fellow bussers,
&gt; I'm a long time luker, first time poster.
&gt; I've got a 69 Westy, and I removed my stock vacuum distribtor yesterday in
&gt; anticipation of getting a new 009 from BusDepot tomorrow.  I was alittle
&gt; bored this morning and I decided to see if I was smart enough re-install it
&gt; and still have everything work properly, before I go throwing new parts in
&gt; it.
&gt; I got the thing back in, and I was setting the timing, just for fun, when I
&gt; when to check the advance, and poof!  Engine died. hmmmmm.
&gt; I discoved that the distributor shaft came away from its drive gear.  Hmmmm.
&gt; I also noticed the dizzy shaft has about 3-4mm of play up and down, thus
&gt; when the RPM's increase, the shaft goes up, engine dies.
&gt; I've been reading about a spring that should be dropped into the hole on the
&gt; crankcase before the dizzy goes in, but I don't recall every seeing a spring
&gt; while removing the dizzy.  And, wouldn't a spring in there just push the
&gt; dizzy shaft up, thus continuously dis-engaging the shaft from the drive gear
&gt; anyway.  I'm puzzled.
&gt; Also, if I have lost the &quot;spring&quot; where can I get another?  I haven't seen
&gt; any in a catalog anywhere, or will it (hopefully) come w/ a new 009?
&gt; thanks
