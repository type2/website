Subject: possibly found the problem?????

Hello again.  Thanks to everyone who responded with
good ideas for us to try on Isabella, our new '72 bus.
So, we checked spark from the coil again, and it IS
getting spark.  Don't know how we missed that the
first time.  Anyway, then we moved on to the
distributor, and (actually a friend did this part),
there is no spark, AND the rotor inside the dist. 
moves, turns.... is it supposed to do that????? 
Someone responded that the body of the dist. should
not turn, and it doesn't, but what about the rotor???
Please help again.  You were all so helpful last time.
 It feels good to be a part of a big family like this!
Do you guys think we are going to have to replace the
dist.???  And if so, you have to do a complete engine
overhaul for that, right?   YIKES!
Thanks again, peace to all, 
Candra &amp; Jonathan
