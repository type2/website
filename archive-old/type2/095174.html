Subject: installation of a stereo

I own a 1972 westy and I can not find anyone who knows how to install a car 
stereo in it. I wouldn't think that it would be that hard but I just cant 
figure it out. If anyone knows what the easiest way might be I would 
appriciate it if they could explain. Thanks
