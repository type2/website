Eberspacher--Great heater w/lots of safety devices.  Temperamental if not
installed correctly.  4,000-16,000 BTU's/hr 

Stewart Warner.  Gobs O'heat(qualitativally more than Eberspacher).  IMHO,
lacking in the safety department--tends to overheat.  Much more forgiving
of poor installations (perhaps that is why JB prefers them--less tech
support?) 


As an aside, S.W. made the diesel heaters for the personnel carriers I used
to drive while earning college money.  Totally different design. On high,
they would overheat
