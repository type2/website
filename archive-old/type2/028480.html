You might wanna go back in time to see the love and planning that went into
my little 1776cc type 1 beauty.  She's the best one I ever built...moderate,
quiet, powerful and extremely reliability.  I'd take that challenge,
especially if Rick keeps towing stuff ;-)  It'd be no contest on a 1/4 mile
though...stock fuel injection is great but no match for my 42DCNFs (sorry
Rick).

&gt; I agree completely that putting a type 1 in a late bus is pure folly.

&gt; I also agree that a *stock* type 1 is underpowered and won't last as long
as
&gt; a stock type 4 engine.
&gt; Now my very un-stock 1776 type 1 in my 71 bus is *real* strong after ~80K
&gt; and I bet I make it to 200K no problem.
&gt;
&gt; I'll race ya Rick ;-)

Steve, Rick:
Now is this race to 200k miles? (With no spare parts or overhauls?) That
would
be pretty interesting. My money would be on the type 4.
