Subject: Brake pads binding

Hey all,

	With the brake hose disconnected my from disc brakes are still
binding.  I can spin the wheel but the brake pads are dragging on the disc
the whole way around.  This is my first experience with disc brakes.  I
know that disc brakes are self-adjusting but surely they aren't supposed to
drag.  Could the problem be with whatever mechanism (spring?) returns the
pads to their &quot;off&quot; position?

	Also, is &quot;Dot 3&quot; brake fluid the correct brake fluid for my '71
bus?  It was all the auto store carried.  Just want to be sure since I read
that you aren't supposed to mix Dot 3 with Dot 5.

Thanks for any and all help,
Adam Rechs
