Last year at my friend's wedding, we needed to move the beer and wine from
his parent's house to the reception hall.  He drives a Jeep, and the other
guy with us, the other groomsman, drives a Z28.  So guess who gets
volunteered?  That's right, me.  So, in to my '74 we go.

We piled 25 cases (24 BOTTLES each, ugh!) of beer, 5 cases of wine and 2
cases of champagne into my poor bus.  We then drove, with the three of us
in the bus, over 20 miles of freeway and up one of the longest hills
around.  The groom and I are both 6'5&quot; and 240 and 220 respectively, and
the third guy is around 180.  The brakes were non-functional, and needed
to be changed right after this trip.  We made it, but boy was it ugly.
Never again.

The entire floor was covered at least 2 cases high including behind the
back seat and the walkthrough.  The springs didn't bottom out, which
surprised me.
