Doktor Tim sends:

&gt;&gt; How in the world do you put Fuel Injection in a dual carbed beast??
&gt; 
&gt; It would have to be engineered, or fabricated and trial and errored to
&gt; death. The 1.7L never was delivered with FI. Then, of course, it wouldn't
&gt; be stock, where the highest value to the most is found. Why?? Cause it's
&gt; easy to make stock work right.

This guy converts Rabbit FI systems to work on aircooled VWs. IIRC, it's
around $800 for his Type 4 kit.
