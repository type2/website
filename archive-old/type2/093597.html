Subject: Re: [T2] Rotors turned... too much?

 
&gt;I just had my rotors turned.  The mechanic said the left wasn't too bad...
&gt;he didn't say how much he took off.  The right one was worse.  He had to
&gt;take it down .015&quot; to get it looking nice.  Is this too much?  I can't find
&gt;the specs in Haynes and I don't have access to Bentley.  The Bentley for the
&gt;Karmann Ghia says not to take more than .008&quot; off.  Will this be a problem
&gt;on (I think) '73 - '79 brakes?

Bentley says the thickness shouldn't be below 11.50mm.
