Subject: Runs a while then quits (Fri)

Since it's Friday.... my buddy's son Michael has an early 90s Honda with around 
300,000 miles on the odo.  Runs OK then quits.... and Michael has not found the 
cause.  

a) Anyone know why a distributor for early 90s Honda would cost 300-400 bucks?  
Is it somehow integrated with the ignition coil, or the computer system??

b) We all know there are any number of ways a 300,000 mile car can fail.  The 
distributor was the guess of one tech.  Anyone on this list with aging-Honda 
experience?

Thanx,  Glenn, Queenstown, Maryland

&gt; Have changed the
&gt; fuel filter, the old one was clean, replaced the AFM,
&gt; no change , also replaced the eletronic brain, with no
&gt; change. Put new spark plugs and points also, still no
&gt; change.

If possible, as Bob said, check fuel pressure.

Do you hear the fuel pump running? Louder than usual? If you touch it
with your bare hand is it cold? Did you check your cap/rotor for
scorching, cracks, etc?

Just some easy things to check...
