Subject: battery tray weld

I have read the archives on replacing the battery tray, from which I have
gleaned the following:
1) Buy the replacement tray from Das Bulli Haus in Conn.  Pay a little more
and there is a remote chance you will not have a LOT of cutting to make it
fit.
2) This is a difficult job to weld in the new one. It is best left to a pro,
but only if you have lots of money to throw at him.

Now, I have access to a new mig welder, but dont have access to a good
welder(human). Being the hard-headed-glutton-for-punishment I am, I think I
am going to disregard #2 above and try my hand at this on my 77 westy. Any
new feedback on the points above?
Could one of you who have tackled this write me personally so I can email
you for some pointers and questions, moral support, and the like? My engine
is out and I feel now is the time to &quot;reseal&quot; the eng compartment by booting
my well vented battery tray. I just want the fix to be right. (RIR)
Thanks!
