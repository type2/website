&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm contemplating a top-end rebuild for my '66 (might split the case, but only 
&gt; for recreation) and was wondering about the trade-offs.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm pretty happy with the performance of the bus as it is now (1600 dp) but I'm pretty
&gt; sure she's stressing on the hills.  Would a 1641 make a noticible difference with respect
&gt; to hills?  I'd likely stay with stock carb.
&gt; 
&gt; Would mileage change either way?
&gt; 
&gt; My goal is a reliable engine, not a rocket (yeah, like thats possible...)
&gt; 

This is definitely my 2 cents.

I recommend you stay with the stock size engine, buy a new case, and use 
a counter-weighted crank from Gene Berg. You will also end up using their 
forged pistons (cut for clearance). I would also stay with the stock 
single port witht the stock carburetor. Maybe You might want to use HD 
valve springs (Stock ones will float if revved too high). Also use a 
stock cam or maybe an Engle 100.

The real kicker, IMHO, is to have the engine professionally balanced. 
This means taking every part that rotates, from clutch cover to the 
balancer pulley, and having it dynamically balanced. This makes the 
engine a lot smoother, will make the case last a lot longer (at least 
100,000 miles), and will make about 10% more horsepower over the thrown 
together variety of A/C VW. The extra HP will vary depending on your 
wallet size, but you will be amazed, I think, at the amount of HP picked 
up on just a fresh stock motor (completely stock) over one that has some 
miles on it; Night and Day difference.

Again my 2cents. Good luck!
