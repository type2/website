Subject: Re: [T2] moody fuel injection

Richard,

Was off line yesterday, so will answer now.

Based on my past expierience of looking in &quot;newish&quot; fuel lines, I would 
tend to say false.

Varnish is only going to happen after you have let things set for a long 
time.  

Injector cleaner has got to be very similar to carb cleaner, right?
When you clean your carb(old dirty insides), does it come off in flakes or
dissolve....

If you pull a metal fuel line and look into it, what does it look 
like?....assuming that you have been driving it fairly often.

I asked a question similar to this on the diy fuel injecton list and the
answer was negative.  Best deal is to get the injectors cleaned(they do it 
ultrasonically also), and go on...

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; Sounds like you need to run some serious injector cleaner through
&gt; &gt; there...maybe even replace the injectors.  The only way I can think of
&gt; &gt; that it ran with all 4 injectors unplugged was that they are leaking
&gt; &gt; terribly....from garbage holding them open when they are supposed to be
&gt; &gt; closed.
&gt; 
&gt; The folks who clean injectors for a living tell me that fuel injector
&gt; cleaner is a double edged sword. When the insides of the fuel lines have
&gt; varnish build-up and you use the cleaner too regularly that stuff flakes off
&gt; and ends up in the injector. T or F?
