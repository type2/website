Subject: [T2] oil cooler question

Hey everybody,
I am on Chirco's waiting list for the 1175$ zero mile 1600dp.  I plan on
changing from reg oil to synthetic(Any thoughts?) and I think i read
somewhere that my doghouse oil cooler (1971 westy) must be replaced.  Is
this so? I guess it makes sense.  Also do you guys have any opinions on
full flow oil kits(filter, cooler, thermostat,maxi pump etc).  I wanted
to run a full flow kit to get the extra cooling and filtering but the
muir book says they are not worth it. Does anyone out there have a oil
cooling kit they seem to enjoy and have few problems with?  any response
will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks, Brian--71 campmobile
