The fact that it pulls to the left does not necessarily mean that the front 
right 
brakes do not grab as well as the front left.  Did you test this hypothesis 
another way?  How?
Check these other possible scenarios:
1)  Uneven &quot;grabbing&quot; by the rear brakes.
2)  Poor front end alignment.
3)  Uneven inflation of the front tires.
4)  Uneven wear or tread design of the front tires (try rotating them).

Hope this helps.
