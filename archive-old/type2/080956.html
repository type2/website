Have you checked your motor mounts.  Sounds like the torque of the engine my
be creating a vibration.

Subject: [T2] FW: 2.0L Engine Noise


&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; I moved from flat Orlando to hilly San Diego, and my 77 Bus now tends to
&gt; make a very rapid rattling noise from the engine area when decelerating,
&gt; especially at slower speeds going down the steep hills in San Diego. It
&gt; often occurs momentarily as the engine slows to idle when taken out of
gear.
&gt; I think the noise may have occured occasionally in Orlando, but the hills
&gt; here seem to make it much more frequent. It kind of sounds like a big
diesel
&gt; truck using its engine brake. It doesn't seem tmperature dependent.  Is
this
&gt; normal on hills, or possibly a bad thing? I don't know the miles on the
&gt; engine, but it runs fine, gets frequent tune-ups, and had compression
about
&gt; 130 all around less than a year ago.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; RickG
&gt;
