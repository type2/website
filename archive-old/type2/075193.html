&gt;Painting an engine case is a very bad idea.  You want the heat to dissipate,
&gt;paint is insulating it in the case.........it seems that Berg wrote about
&gt;this or maybe Hoover........

interesting theory- i've never found any proof. anyone ?
i've also seen some deep-end stuff from Berg that borders on insanity.
Perhaps if a thing is repeated often enough it simply becomes true.
