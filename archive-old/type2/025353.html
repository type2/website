There are two panels in the back of a Bus between the taillight and the
engine compartment lid. The one on the passenger side of Edelstein looks
like a three-foot, 500-lb version of Joe Cool leaned up against it with his
hand and shoved a fairly ugly dent into it. Anyone got any ideas as to how
to get rid of this dent? &quot;Bondo&quot; is not an acceptable answer; that's what
the PO did and as a result I'm starting to think Edelstein's PO married the
daughter of the guy who invented polyester body filler...
