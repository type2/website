&gt;Wow, the idea of flashing your high-beams to tell them it's not safe to pass
&gt;is pretty scary, since for as long as I've driven, I've always understood
&gt;that this is a signal to say it is safe.  I only do this to big trucks
&gt;(and they often give nice signals back) and I presumed I was correct.  The

i also have used the high-beam flash to signal a truck (who is passing me on
the left) that it is SAFE to come back over into the right lane in front of
me. this seems to be common across all the parts of the u.s. that i've driven
(mostly the southeast and west, with a little up in the midwest). now, other
parts of the country may do it differently, but this is what i've seen used
on 4-lanes and 2-lanes where i've driven.

in the old days, the truckers would completely cut off their lights to signal
&quot;it's safe&quot;, and i still see some drivers (old pharts?) using this.

&gt;trucks need the flash because it is real hard to estimate the position of the
&gt;end of one of those triple-trailer beasts they drive out west here.  I'd sure

true, and some drivers don't come back over immediately after you flashing
them. they'll wait until they can see better ... the mark of a safer driver.
;)  but, of course, this is usually on a 4-lane interstate (when they wait).

just my 0.02. :)
