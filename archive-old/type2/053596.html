Subject: VW Bus on TV this Sunday

    I'm fairly sure that there will be a Volkswagen
Bus on TV this Sunday evening on a show called Seeing
Red. I saw the last few seconds of a commercial for
it, and everyone was standing by a green and white
Bus.
    The show starts at 9 P.M. Eastern Time on WCNY
channel 24 out of Syracuse, New York.
