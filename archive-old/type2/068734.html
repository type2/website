Subject: Cooling flaps spring grommets? Was:81 thermostat 

&gt;Installing the new unit was easy enough though per usual there were
&gt;unexpected complications. In this case I had bought new plastic grommets 
for
&gt;the flap bar to ride in. Getting those in involved loosening and prying tin
&gt;up etc. I also had a new red plastic piece left over that was related to 
all
&gt;this but I've since forgotten what it's purpose was. Next time I'm back at
&gt;the dealer, I'll get them to look it up again.

After the fire, the flaps on my engine are a bit stiff and/or the 
spring that opens them has lost its temper so that they don't open by 
themselves anymore?
Questions:
Can I renew the spring/flaps without pulling the engine? How?
If I get the engine tin off, can I replace teh spring or do I have to
replace flaps with the spring?
Plastic grommets? What plastic grommets? Is that what the melted stuff
I thought had dripped into  the pivots?

Note: I have flipped wire off the pully, so the thermostat can't close them
anymore and left them in the open position for now, so I know it isn't
the thermostat that is the problem.

Thanks
