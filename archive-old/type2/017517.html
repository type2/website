An initial warm up pre-tuning testride revealed beautiful up shifts through 
1st , 2nd and 3rd, but lousy bogging down 
behavior at the top of each gear rpm range, just before shifting up. 

Spun the crank to TDC for number one. scrapped off the white out mark there, 
rubbed some dirt in it, made a new 
mark at 5 degrees after TDC, hooked up the timing gun with the advance knob 
set to zero, started up the bus and 
let it warm up and the choke open. Took awhile without a thermostat (DOH!) 
checked the dwell angle, which was 
49 degrees with no noticeable change as I pulled back the cam. when fully 
warmed up it was idling on the verge 
of stalling, pointed the timing light at the crank and saw that it was set to 
0 TDC, so I loosened the clamp and advanced 
the distributor until my new mark lined up with the case crack. Sounded 
better and brought the idle up to about 1150.
Had some problems locking it in without the distributor moving due to a boss 
located under the distributor neck that
interferes with a socket on the 10mm clamp nut, no wonder why the thing looks 
stripped. Anyway locked that in, turned 
off the motor and counted the turns on each screw - 1.25 turns out on the big 
boy and 3 turns out on the little peckernecker.
reset them and tried to start the motor and nothing - no start. Then I reset 
the little screw to 2.75 turns out, and turned the 
big one in all the way and began trying to start it, each time turning the 
big screw out .25 of a turn, until it caught and idled at around 1.75 turns 
out, at which seemed like in the ballpark of 900. turned the little screw 
looking for the fast spot, without 
turning too far in either direction, but noticed no discernible change. the 
34.3 probably has a fair amount of wear, so I just turn
the little screw back in a bit until I felt the rpm dropped a hair, then the 
big screw back out until I think it increased a hair, shut the engine door, 
got in the van and drove around the neighborhood a few times. 

Now the bogging was totally gone, but there was the faintest hint of 
hesitation in the rpms upon shift up. as I drove it around 
some more it seemed to disappear, (it might be the slightly worn pressure 
plate, TO bearing and return spring) leaving me with a smooth running  and 
advancing vehicle that still has air in the brakes,
but stops with the servo working. sprayed the bleeder bolts with 40 and am 
interviewing assistants for the bleeding procedure. Appears that the stock 
set-up does work on 71 bus with no changes, however I still keep my 009 in my 
inside jacket pocket, just in case.
