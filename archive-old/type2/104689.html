Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Bus Depot where are you?

 &quot;Did I trust too much? what about my credit card!?&quot;

It's natural to have apprehension when dealing with an internet-based
company for the first time. I have been dealing with Bus Depot for many
years. Sometimes their shipping seems a bit slow and they are sometimes hard
to reach via email.... I have never had any problem telephoning them.

And, yes, on occasion they will make mistakes. I just recently got two
driver's side tail light lenses from them when I ordered a pair. I emailed
and they sent out a replacement immediately (at their cost) and reimbursed
me for the shipping on the returned item. I regularly order from them and
I'm over 1000 miles away from their shop and the shipping delays are
sometimes frustrating when I'm in a hurry.

I've recently found a &quot;local&quot; parts supplier in Little Rock, Arkansas and
now I can use them for getting parts fast...but I'll always order any parts
I can from Bus Depot; they have quality parts at rock-bottom-prices that
can't be matched. Typically, if I buy an item locally, it will cost double
what Ron is asking for the same part.

So, relax... you are in good hands with Bus Depot... they will never
KNOWINGLY do you an injustice and will go to great lengths to ensure all is
right if they accidentally mess up.
