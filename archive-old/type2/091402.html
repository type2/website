&gt; Don't get the nail polish remover on your paint
&gt; because it will damage it.

The solvent in nail polish remover is acetone.  It's better to get a can
of pure acetone from a hardware or paint store than to use nail polish
remover, as the remover often has oils in it that will make cleanup
harder.  Also, the wife gets testy when she discovers that I've used her
entire bottle of remover on some job or other!  :)
