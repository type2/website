Subject: Re: [T2] Paint question...

&lt;&lt;      And the upgrade...the sprayer your mom got with her
Kirby vacuum...&gt;&gt;

Now we're getting somewhere Anthony---

When my Mom &amp; Dad got married they had a 40 Merc.
Mom had a brand new Electrolux vacuum cleaner with the spray painting
attachment that fit on the end vacuum hose, that fit into the exhaust
grill on the front of the vacuum.

Dad painted the Merc with the Electrolux &amp; some silver paint.

I'll have to dig up some pictures of it--what a joke--what a dust
magnet.
He did i in the big paint booth in the back yard--the sky, the brids,
the bee's, the flies ---

A Chea Pet 40 Merc.-- ~8: )


I suppose the Elctrolux / Kirby paint job would be just about as good as
a Wagner spit shine job.
