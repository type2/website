Subject: Final BOTC Update

Hi Volks,

Despite recent events in Toronto I want to take this opportunity to  
stress that this weekend's event is NOT AirBuses of the Corn. Having  
seen the fire that followed the crash of the A-340 I am amazed there  
were no fatalities. The good news for BOTC is that the airport is  
about 50 miles west of BOTC; and traffic on Hwy 401 is back to usual.  
(Which is to say, FUBAR).

It's been a busy week here and I expect this to be the last update  
before I head out to BOTC. I have visited the site and things are  
looking good. There's no fire ban, and the lawns have been mowed  
somewhat recently. It's amazing how many suburbs have popped up  
around the conservation area, but it's still a full kilometer away  
from the Walmart so we should be safe for the time being.  The local  
corn harvest is now under way and the warm weather has brought in a  
bumper crop.

Speaking of weather... It promises to be pretty good. The forecast is  
sunny with night-time lows near 16C / 60F and highs near 30C / 86F

BRING:
A burrito Breakfast Ingredient
A musical instrument to play at the campfire.
A red cup for your beverage. If you do not have a beverage, one *may*  
be provided for you.
A leash for your pet, if you bring a pet.
Quarters for the showers. Two will be enough if you're quick. Shower  
with a friend and $ave!!!
Something to share for the Pot-Luck Dinner.

DON'T BRING:
Anything Electrical. There is no Electricity on-site available for  
fridges or patio lights. Bring a cooler and buy ice at that Walmart I  
mentioned.
Firearms or Fireworks (which includes a case for the campfire)
