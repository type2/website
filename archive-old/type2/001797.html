Right, I take it you got the loom? It comes in 2 parts, 1 goes around the
heater, fuel pump, coil, fans, thermal cut-outs etc. up through the chassis
&amp; into the cab via a 2x1&quot; slot next to where the main bus loom exits the
cab. The second loom part plugs into the first just under the washer bottle.
There is a relay device with a ceramic resistor that mounts low near the
main air 'up' duct in the middle of the cab, then another black box that
fits under the fuse box, with leads going to ground &amp; 2 sets with red wires
that go to terminals 11 &amp; 10 (?) on the fuse box (1 permanent &amp; 1 ignition
controlled). The last box is the thermostat/timer that mounts under the
Speedo like the other switches. It has a green knob that lights up &amp; can be
turned anti-clockwise when the engine is on, or pushed &amp; turned to run on
the battery when the engine is not on. This has a wire that would normally
go to a switch on the heater levers, but you can just ground it to the
Speedo pod.

On the heater, the bits that should be with it are :-

Small combustion fan (MUST HAVE 1&quot; HOSE 2' LONG TO GET AIR)
Blower fan (rat wheel type)
Fuel pump
Coil

As long as the heater was removed carefully you should have all you need,
there are still some parts around, but they get VERY expensive. Mail me for
any more 'Q's &amp; I'll try &amp; help. I would STRONGLY suggest that you visit
vintagebus_dot_com &amp; down-load the 80 images of the heater manual, so you have a
guide when installing away from the PC.

################### IMPORTANT ######################
These heaters get VERY hot &amp; will cause a fire VERY quickly if not fitted
with respect. Never cheat the cut-outs. Drain the tank &amp; always replace ALL
the fuel lines. Also make the connection with the existing system BEFORE the
fuel pump or you'll smoke like a train.

Make sure you have another person present &amp; have a water drenched THICK
blanket, 2 BIG buckets of water &amp; a proper commercial fire extinguisher (the
one you take camping will last 10 seconds IF your lucky).

BTW
If like me you do get a leak or just when your splicing the line in
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT!!! eyes too, coz petrol stings like a
 'C U Next Tuesday!!!'

Have fun!!
