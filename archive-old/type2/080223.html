Subject: Re: [T2] Performance Mufflers for Busses

Jim,
Just read this month's Hot VW's issue, and they tested a single quiet
pack, a dual quiet pack, and a fat boy (page 60).  Engine was a mild
1641, 009, dual Brosol/Solex 40 carbs, timing _at_ 30 deg advance, 130 mains,
45 idles.

Single:  81.9 hp _at_ 4500 rpm
Dual: 82.8 hp _at_ 4500 rpm
Fat Boy:  84.6 hp _at_ 4500 rpm.

I run a single quiet pack and a stinger on occasion.  The single is nice
and quiet, stinger is obnoxious.  Seat of the pants, the single QP gives
me enough backpressure for the hills, lower rpm stuff.  For being loud
and on flat land, the stinger is more fun.

Later,

Simon Ramirez Jr.

&gt; Hey all:

I talked to the folks at Gene Berg, and they use the &quot;quiet pack&quot; type
of muffler.  Unfortunately, the guy I talked to at Berg didn't know much
about the performance aspects of that type muffler.  Does anyone out
there in list land know anything about &quot;Quiet Pack&quot; mufflers, or any
other kind of performance muffler?&lt;snip&gt;
