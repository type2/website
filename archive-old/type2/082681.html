&gt; Hi.
&gt;
&gt; The rubbing 'leg' on my ignition points 'wore' down in just a few thousand
&gt; miles and in just a few months.  They were installed in June 2001 on a '78
&gt; Westy FI 2.0l by yours truly, and have about 6K miles on them.
&gt;
&gt; But the closing of the points was within a single month, and less than 1K
&gt; miles.  During this single month period, I read the points at 50, then 60,
&gt; then 70+ and then the Westy became unreliable.  Chug-a, chug-a.  I could not
&gt; see ANY gap on them.

I can see why!  90 degrees dwell means the points never open at all!

&gt; My previous two sets of points show NO perceptible wear on the fiber leg; I
&gt; still have them (one set at 40K miles, next set at more than 12K miles. All
&gt; three sets of points have the brown fiber 'leg'.  My new points are
&gt; Brazilian and have a white fiber 'leg')

I've experienced a set of &quot;rapid wear&quot; points.  Don't know why, but they
just wore out fast.  Other points I've used ran fine for 15000+ miles.
I've had the same problem with generator brushes.  One brush goes away in
a few hundred miles, while its mate barely shows any wear.  I suppose it's
just shoddy quality control.
