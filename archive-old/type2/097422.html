Subject: Re: [T2] seat design question

&gt; I
&gt; took the rests off so I could fit a childs cot up front, but kinda
&gt; like having them gone altogether. Does anyone know if the seat covers
&gt; that will fit the stock seats are available without head rest holes?

More than likely, the holes are not there until you cut them and then put in
the plastic guides.
Since you say you have a 79 bus and you put in a childs cot, I am assuming you
do not have a Westy?
If the seats you have are brown vinyl and they are in good shape
otherwise..... you can push in the plugs that take the place of the headrests
for the rear seats. I have a bunch of those plugs......
