Subject: Re: [T2] rough idle

Darren said:


 I forgot to mention, when resetting my timing, the timing mark on
the pully is all over the place. 7.5,5,8, etc. Made it difficult
to set. Had to set it where it hit 7.5BDTC the majority of the
time.   I wonder if my distributor is shot. I'm going to replace
dist cap and rotor today, but I dont think that will help.
I'm assuming the points/condensor are ok since I have a solid
dwell reading.

Never ever ASSUME.  1st place to look when timing at idle is all over the place is the points. Replace them,
even if dwell is steady.
