Hello Everyone

I have been off the list for a while because my bus had been running fine
and doing great, so I hope you will except me back into the fold in my time
of need ;-)

Engine: AVP rebuilt type IV 1800 with around 7000 miles, maintained to order
since install Jan. of 2000.

On a 250 mile trip the other week I started getting a &quot;ping&quot; during
acceleration in 4th gear. I had just put gas in around 60 miles earlier and
every thing seamed fine, the engine was no hotter than usual, the only thing
is I had put a tad to much oil in and it was to the top of the second line?

I stopped at a rest area to check things out, no pinging as I had to go into
second gear as I begin to stop. Engine was a little hotter than at the gas
station, I asked my wife to start him up and noticed a puff of black smoke
which weekend with several revs of the engine, idle was fine and things
&quot;seamed&quot; to be ok. Take off again!

Same pinging except this time under load in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th until speed
was obtained, then only pinging when I put the engine under load.

After driving for another 40 miles I noticed I was loosing power, no pops or
bangs, just no power, so I drift to the side of the road.

In a state of, &quot;o ship yards what do I do&quot; I find the engine is very hot now
but I think it has to be to much oil and decide to drain some out, of course
I have to screw the nut to the last threads to get any to drain, and as I
hold the wrench the heat dissipates to my hand and starts burning, so I let
go, which makes the bolt fall out, knowing I only have one qt. of oil I
decide I'm MAN enough to handle hot oil, nope a few 3rd degree burns and I
just let the oil drain, Time for a tow cause ain't no way someone would
stop.

A 55 mile tow and 3 hours latter I'm able to take a look at things and
decide to put oil back in and start it up, I do and as I start it up I start
burning more oil as it is thicker as I give it a few revs, it pops a little
as I do this, then things get better, the burning oil is less and the
popping is no longer present after 4 or 5 min. of running. The local
mechanic takes a look and thinks we will be ok. Sure enough we make it to
the beach about another 75 mile drive or so.

However toward the end of this drive I start getting what sounds like a
exhaust leek at slower speeds and start off in all gears, although I no
longer get the Pinging in 4th gear under load.

The next morning I talk to a vw mechanic and he thinks I have &quot;dropped a
Valve&quot; exactly what he had happen to a AVP engine he installed, however it
happened in less than 2000 miles. He suggest I drop back the timing which I
do along with adjusting the valves again after less than 500 miles since the
last adjustment, and yes they where TIGHT!

We decide to try the 250 mile drive back home after enjoying the beach
hoping we would make it without needing a tow or bothering a friend.

Now I get a &quot;chirp&quot; as I start the engine and what sounds like a exhaust
leak again, however it fades as the engine warms up so we head out. This
time the pinging in all gears is less, but in 4th gear I have PLENTY of
power under load, in fact have to pass a few trucks and do so with no
problems. The engine stays cool and we make it home with no major problems,
thank you HOSS!

When I start it now I still get the &quot;chirp&quot; and Exhaust leak sound that will
go away during idle, however will return as I rev the Engine?

So if you have made it this far I hope I have given enough info for someone
to give me a guess as what has happened and more importantly what will it
take to correct this?


I do owe a BIG THANK YOU to Brian, he owns a 74 or so camper and actually
stopped to offer assistance, however the tow truck came shortly after he
stopped and I didn't want to take up too much of his time! He lives in
Wilmington and was driving home from school in western NC, any one know him,
I forgot to ask if he was on the list?

Thank you for any advice the list can share, I'm glad your here in time of
need?

Meredith Murray
