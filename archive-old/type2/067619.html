I hope that it is as simple and easy as one of your tires has lost 
it's balance weight.  Tire balance behavior seems to be related to 
speed.  If you have had the tires on for awhile, look closely on the 
edge of the rim for where a balance weight used to be by looking for 
a clean spot.  Check both inside and outside rims.
If so, get the tire balanced!

&gt; Specifically, a vibration in the steering wheel that comes and goes.  It can
&gt; be gone for a looong time, and return without warning.  It did this morning,
&gt; as I rounded a curve on the hiway east of town.  It only can be noticed at
&gt; 55-58+ mph.
