Hi all,

     Well it looks like I will be pulling the engine out of my 79 camper.
This is nothing new but I have a question.  I would like to be able to pull
the motor without a second person helping me.  With a regular floor jack
that is a little dicey.  Would a transmission jack allow me to do this?  Do
most of them have the reach for this?  Have any of you done it this way?
Thanks.
