Hiya Tommy,

I'd suggest that you go with alternative (d).  

Just mosey on down to your local VW dealership parts counter and ask for 175 
201 801A.  It'll cost you $61.80 and your parts counterman will have to order 
it from a regional warehouse facility.  Mine is on order as we speak (the 
warehouse in California currently has 66 in stock).

Good luck!

Mike
