William A. McKinley asks:

&gt;Has anyone any experience replacing ball joints on a loaf? Must the torsion 
arms
&gt;be removed fron the van as outlined in Bently, or can the joints be replaced
&gt;while they're on the van using a ball joint press tool? How likely is it that
&gt;I'll find that the bearing surfaces/bearings on the torsion arm will be worn? 

&gt;

William,

According to everyone that I have talked with there is no way to get the ball 
joints out without removing the torsion arms -- even on a bug. It takes a lot 
of pressure with an hydraulic press.

Check out my experience at http://coyote.accessnv_dot_com/wayback/b_joint.html

My choice regarding the torsion arms was to order the set of arms/ball joints 
from Wolfgang. I had difficulty finding a place with the proper equipment to 
R&amp;R the ball joints. The fittings that drive the ball joint in &amp; out are 
different from a bug. All the VW shops only did bugs.
