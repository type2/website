Subject: Re: what are all these knobs?

&gt;Next; the battery light on my dash never lights up, but I can 
&gt;seem to get the little sucker apart to check the bulb. Any thoughts?

If you're refering to an orange plastic lens with a white &quot;B&quot; printed on it 
that is mounted into your dash, this is your brake system warning light, not a 
battery light.  Since you have a 71, this light should come on in &quot;test&quot; mode 
along with your generator light and oil light when you turn your key to the on 
position without starting your motor.

If, as you say, NONE of your dash lights are working, you probably have a 
common problem amongst them - like a missing ground wire to the main gauge body?

The wiring behind the dash can be quite daunting if things are not hooked up.  
The best thing to do is to pull the instrument cluster so you can see 
everything and start working through what is and isn't hooked up.  The wiring 
diagram in Bentley's is very usefull for this.

Good luck!
