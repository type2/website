&gt;&gt; &gt; wires. After I replaced the plugs and wires, it didn't have as much power,
&gt;&gt; &gt; would lose speed badly on hills.
&gt;&gt;       Sounds like you misplaced the wires, a common thing --- even if
&gt;&gt;you did
&gt;minor loss of power. When I brought her home, she'd zip up all but the
&gt;worst hills at 55-60. Now I'm lucky if I can get 45 up a small hill. I
&gt;can't drive her on the freeway, but we do fine around town. When I had #1
&gt;and #2 reversed, I couldn't get anywhere at all.
&gt;

I had a '71 with burnt valves that had all the exact symptoms you describe-
lost power stedily; hard to get it to idle well.
