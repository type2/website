Good things about AAA:
1. Nice maps.
2. Towing service (quite restricted unless you pay extra, though)
3. Mechanic Mediation service (only if you use a AAA-affiliated garage.)

Bad things about AAA:
1. They lend political support to any restrictive new driving or
automotive legislation.  
2. They support &quot;clunker law&quot; legislation that threatens our right to
own and drive our older buses.
3. Their Tour Guide books only cover the most expensive facilities. 
For more comprehensive information, it's better to contact the
department of tourism in the state(s) you wish to visit.
4. Their insurance is among the most costly available.


In the 1950s and before, AAA was an organization that promoted
motoring rights.  They even sanctioned races and speed record
attempts!  AAA has evolved into an insurance company with some
attractive sidelines.  As an insurance company, their only goal is to
minimize their exposure to risk, regardless of whether this is the
desire of the &quot;members&quot;.
