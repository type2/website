&gt;In response to  everyone who has been talking about vw theft,personally I

I used to think that way.  Then my bus got stolen.  Those who have seen my
bus know that it is no beauty.  It was stolen from right outside my
apartment, driven somewhere, stripped, then driven back to near my
apartment and ditched in a parking lot.

I lost all of my tools (and I mean all - multimeter, compression tester,
jackstands, valve spring compressor, etc... had no garage at the time),
dash-mounted Pioneer stereo, speakers, even a nice denim jacket from the
closet.  They also destroyed my ignition switch and steering column.  There
was no evidence of them having broken anything to get in, but I'm sure the
bus was locked.  They probably got in through the vent wing or passenger
door as was suggested on this list.

What to do?  As David M. Brodbeck suggested, an ignition kill is an
excelling idea.  If you have an electric fuel pump, a fuel pump cutoff is
equally effective.  With both of these together, it would take a thief some
time to get it started.  I also use a club steering wheel lock on my bus
when in the city.  The biggest thing to do, however, is DO NOT LEAVE
VALUABLES IN PLAIN SIGHT!  I broke this rule the night my bus was stolen by
leaving the lid off of the rear seat where all of my tools were stored.
The nice-looking stereo in the dash was another draw (the joke was on him
though, the tape player was broken).  

I learned from my mistakes and now I keep valuables covered up.  The
speakers were either disguised or hidden, the stereo went into the glove
box.  I have since moved the stereo to the overhead console, but it is a
pullout and I am building a cover for it as well.  I'll probably put a fake
AM radio front on the cover.

The main thing is not to leave things like cameras, tools, or stereos in
plain sight.  Other things are probably okay though, if they are not things
that theives want.  For instance, the guy that stole my bus didn't bother
to take my inverter or the slew of VDO gauges I had installed under the
dash.  The gauges obviously weren't worth anything at a pawn shop and being
a third grade dropout he probably didn't know what an inverter was.
