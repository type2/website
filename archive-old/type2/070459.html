Subject: Re: Help with replacing Westy top in 68...

Ken,

On my '71, there's a plastic strip over the cloth; the staples go through
that strip (about 3/32&quot; thick) and then through the cloth and into the
wood, making it pretty easy to pull the staples. Guess they didn't think
of that in '68? If you can, when you install it back, I'd try to get some
of these strips...or at a minimum put some card board strips on the
outside so you can remove staples in the future without tearing up the
canvas.

BTW, if I only had holes to patch, I'd leave the top on and do it by hand.
Of course, you've got a screen to replace too. 8(

Best of luck! Joe
