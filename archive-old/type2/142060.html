Subject: Re: [T2] adding a poptop to a westy?

I would like to add a moon- or sunroof to my poptop. It would be nice to 
enjoy some light or stars on a good trek out of town! Anyone add one to 
a poptop?

I live up the road from the shop you mentioned. I'll stop by and ask 
them. Thanks for the idea.
