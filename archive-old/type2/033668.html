Subject: Can this cylinder be saved. . .

Hubby finally got around to looking a the engine in his bus (71 upright)
and found that that plug is fouled (oil), when cleaned it fires fine,
seems to be no compression in that cylinder.  He will be performing a
compression test later this evening.  

It has been running rough (missing) and occaisionally backfiring.  Oh,
and also, this started very suddenly.   He's guessing something with
busting a ring or what?  

Thanks for the help--and if it is bad news, not to worry, he's been
wanting to put a new engine in the puppy since I almost fried it.  I
know now  NOT to drive the thing, even a little way, if the gen light
goes on. . . Boy, am I glad I didn't do it to MY van.

Thanks, 

Lauria
