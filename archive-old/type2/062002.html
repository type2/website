Great idea! When metal is exposed, it quickly deteriates, as you 
obviously know. As to how to fix it, this depends on how long you are 
looking before going into the repair depot.

Usually, sanding loose all cracked paint, and applying a good primer, 
covered by any reasonable paint, will do the job.  To start with, I 
understand that this is just a job to last a couple years, or less, 
until you get around to the actual body work.

Ok... start by grinding away any loose paint. You can use a grinder, a 
drill mounted grinder pad, a wire brush, course sand paper, a putty 
knife, or anything to remove that paint. Then use a fine sandpaper to 
put a shine on any exposed metal... and &quot;taper&quot; the paint edges back. 
This is very important. If you leave any loose paint, rust will begin to 
form underneath. It usually takes 5 years (or more) to rust through, but 
why take the chance?

Next, you can use any good primer. If you want to get fancy, use a paint 
gun, if you want to do it in the front yard, use the stuff out of the 
rattle can. I wouldn't use the real cheap stuff, but I've had good 
luck with PlastiCoat brand (about $3 a can). Since you've exposed bright 
metal, you don't need primer-surfacer, nor do you need Rustoleum. Rattle 
can top coat is next, to protect the primer, unless you plan on fixing 
the car within the next couple months. 

If you are really concerned about color match, you can find a wide 
variety of rattle-can colors, even in &quot;custom&quot; colors. Check with your 
local paint shop... and they can probably custom-match your color and 
load it into a rattle-can, for about $15 or so. Otherwise, choose any 
color off the shelf (some colors come pretty close).

With care (wash the car before beginning, mask off surrounding parts, 
wash the site with wax remover if it was commonly waxed), this paint job 
will last 5 years or more. It won't be pretty, but I've done &quot;emergency&quot; 
repairs to cars that were good enough that they were never repaired 
properly. The car wore out before rust set in.
