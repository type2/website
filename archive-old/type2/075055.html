Subject: first time T4 engine pull q's

along the lines of the hanging two wires on my FI harness a foot beyond the
ECU, it appears, with the help of listees, the wires may be good for the
throttle valve switch. it seems the 75 had a throttle switch. (perhaps
later years did too and they're unavailable from rmmw? dunno.)  question
is, with my ECU's number:
0 280 000 153
022 906 021 AA
might this ECU have need for a throttle valve switch?  - steve, if i sound
confused it harkens back to the7 prong AFM...and a never completely
reliable vehicle :)
