Subject: [T2] (T2) FS Dormobile in Santa Clara, CA.

I was driving down La Fayette (near Martin) in Santa Clara and stopped at a 
&quot;Donated Vehicle&quot; sale lot.  I spotted a brown and beige '78 or '79 Dormobile 
(it has a catalytic converter) in the back of the lot.  It shows 64,500 miles 
and judging from the wear on the pedals I think it's original miles.  It's 
surprisingly unmolested and complete.  It hasn't been registered since '94 
and has dealer plate frames from Monterey, CA. The proprietor said it needs a 
&quot;fuel system clean up&quot;.  It runs but the tank is full of *&amp;?!+%....  He also 
said he'd take $900 for it, but I'm sure you could get it for less.  
This car would make a great winter project for someone.  I would have bought 
it myself if I didn't have so many &quot;projects&quot; ahead of it.
