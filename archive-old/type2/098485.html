Subject: List charter, advertising, ebay.

&gt; I do not mean to offend. I read the guidelines &quot;Do not try to advertise your

The charter is written in this way to specificly disallow ebay and other
auction postings to the list.  This was done at the popular request from
listmembers.

The section of the charter that covers commercial advertising on the list
reads:

&quot;--Vendors are welcome and encouraged to participate in the list--we've
had several vendors who have been valued list members. Specific answers
to specific queries about products and pricing are fine, but please
avoid repeatedly posting advertisements. What we're looking for here is
high information value for the listees. If we think you are merely
spamming we will moderate you very quickly.&quot;


All non-ebay private forsale ads are welcome, and are not excluded by any
portion of the charter.


&gt; My interest, however, was not mercenary but altruistic. I agree with Sage
&gt; Green (Barry) who wrote: &quot;I think the charter should be changed to allow
&gt; this kind of info sharing.&quot; Letting folks know something is out there,

I'm willing to put this to a vote, OFFLIST.  If you have an opinion about
re-allowing ebay postings to the list, please email your option to
type2-admin_at_type2_dot_com.  DO NOT post these to the list, nor in a reply to
this thread.

You may wish to search the archives regarding this issue before casting
your vote.

The administrative messages relating to this addition to the charter are
here:

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/030416.html

Since this time, we've changed mailservers and mailing list software.  We
do not have the extensively customised moderation features of old and
cannot moderate ebay posts (though we're slowly replacing many of them as
we have time to rewrite them).  Instead, we let list members know when
they've stepped over the line by sending administrative messages to the
listmember and the list.  In the administrators opinion, the message from
John Rogers violated these rules.



&gt; It believe the guidelines should read &quot;Do not try to advertise on the list.&quot;

A general restriction of this nature would prevent anyone selling a bus or
bus part from being able to post it to the list.  I dont think that anyone
would really want that.  The fact is we WELCOME private party forsale
postings, and commercial ads (when they relate directly to the list topics
and are not repeated over and over..) from vendors who participate in the
community.
