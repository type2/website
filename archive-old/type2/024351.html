Hi Folks,

I will be in England from the 19th to the 26th/27th of July coming from
France. I need the following stuff done to my van :

1.Welding - cabin floor+steps needs replacing and because of a lot of
leaking around the windscreen, the dashboard is coming away from the
metal under the windscreen. Not sure if it needs replacing or welding.
2.Rubber - Rubber around some of the windows needs replacing 3.Bodywork
- one of the panels in the rear needs replacing and there is quite a
bit of blistering around most of the van that needs taking care of.
4.MOT required.

Question is : Does anybody know any garages on the south coast, that
could do all this stuff in a week, preferably near one of the ferry
ports coming from France !?

Thanks for any help provided.
