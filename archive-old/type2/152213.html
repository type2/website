&gt; Unfortunately, putting a 2L into a 71 bus is generally accepted as
&gt; one of the more difficult engine transplants. The tin won't fit, and
&gt; the engine has the wrong flywheel for the tranny and starter. And the
&gt; 2L engine is designed to hang from the 72-79 bay tranny, where the
&gt; 68-71 tranny is unable to support it. It's a nightmare, more or less.

well he did say that he had an engine AND transmission, which makes the
job a lot easier...

happy holidays to all busses and pilots
