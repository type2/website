&gt; OK, any of you 'lectrical types know how to &quot;affix&quot; metal tabs
&gt; to rechargeable batteries? My portable drill/driver needs new
&gt; battery packs and it irks me to be charged over half the cost
&gt; of the kit for one battery pack...I unscrewed the pack and it's
&gt; just 1.5V nicad batteries in series, BUT with tabs to connect
&gt; 'em...I've got access to plenty of new Panasonics cheep but
&gt; no way to easily/safely connect 'em...Any &quot;conductive&quot; glue
&gt; or micro spot welders... ?-)

I, too am irked at the cost of proprietary battery packs versus
individual cells.

Unfortunately, I've never been able to solder tabs to the cell terminals.
They aren't copper, so lead/tin solder doesn't stick.  The factory cells
have the tabs spot-welded on.

There are outfits that will rebuild battery packs but of course they want
to sell you the cells.  Still isn't too costly, though.
