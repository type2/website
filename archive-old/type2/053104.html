Hi Volks!

I'm looking for someone who does major repairs on their bus at home and
wouldn't mind a spare set of hands attached to curious eyes to help them.
I've done lot's of little things to my bug and busses over the years but
nothing really complex like dropping the engine, rebuilding the carbs, etc.
So I'd be willing to lend a hand to anyone who needs it if you'll teach me
about what you're up too!
