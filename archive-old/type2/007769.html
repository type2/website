Or that the FI System is not sensing any spark at the ignition, or 
there's a hose off somewhere, or the cable on the back of the air flow 
meter is not connected properly.

The engine will start on the cold start valve and last a couple of 
seconds with any of the above scenarios.  the injectors will not fire as 
the computer is not sensing enough air coming through or a spark at the 
ignition.

try the type2_dot_com page for some great diagnostic help.

The first thing to check when looking at FI problems is the ignition.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;It turns over, fires, runs for two seconds
&gt;
&gt;This sounds like an inadequate fuel pressure problem.  Check the fuel
&gt;pressure relief valve that returns excess fuel to the tank.
&gt;
&gt;Or, the double relay - the circuitry that activates the electric fuel
&gt;pump.
&gt;
&gt;The circuitry design is such that the fuel pump will run under two, and
&gt;only two, circumstances - cranking and running.  It may be that your
&gt;pump is running during cranking, putting sufficient pressure into the
&gt;lines to start and run for a few seconds, but is failing to keep running
&gt;once the engine starts and you stop cranking.
