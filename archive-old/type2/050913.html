&gt;&gt;  ...remember when Nevada didn't have a speed limit?  &lt;&lt;
--------------------------

Indeed!

I used to cruise across Nevada for what seemed like hours in my old '34 Ch*v
Master Deluxe Coupe at 90MPH on the hand throttle.

Cranked those enormous wing windows wide open, rolled down the rear window,
and reveled in the poor man's air conditioning.

Question [and OBC]:  If that old '34 Ch*vy engine could take that without
any harm to it's poured babbit bearings, why can't my camper's VW 1600SP
engine handle 75MPH for extended periods with it's vastly more sophisticated
bearings and engine design?

[This is a rhetorical question, folks.  Save the depth charges for the real
enemy...]
