&gt;Hello All,
&gt;   I have a chance to buy a sliding door from a '68 bus to replace the
&gt;rusted &gt;one on my '76 Westy. Question is, are they the same size, and is
&gt;the hardware &gt;the same? I'm hoping someone out there has tried this
&gt;before, and knows if it &gt;will fit or not.

All I can tell you is that at a minimum the doorhandles are different.

&gt;Same for the rear hatch door, are these interchangable as well?

I don't think so.  I remember the rear hatch seal being a different size
for the type I powered busses than for the type IV powered busses.

&gt;I also want to retain the crank out window in the slider, so is glass size
&gt;the &gt;same as well?

Based on the fact that I've seen the same jalousie windows in all years of
breadloaves, I'd say the glass size is the same.
