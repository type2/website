I have a 73 California Camper which, unfortunately has serious body
and frame damage.  The engine is in great shape with a fresh tuneup,
the interior is in good condition, with foldout bed, sink, fridge.  I
would like to get a new body and replace the interior and/or engine if
needed.  
I have located a 72 bus with Oregon plates, last registered in 95
nearby for a decent price.  I live in San Francisco and wonder if
anyone has any idea how much trouble it is to register an out of state
bus in CA?
Also, will the seats and other interior parts be interchangeable? 
Will I be able to install the sink, etc. without too much trouble 
into the 72 (which is not a camper) without having to drill?  
Thanks for the help.
