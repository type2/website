Subject: Re: GOOD valve cover gaskets?

Hi Blake,

I've always used the common cork type gaskets (I don't use sealer on the
cover) which I replace every 3k miles when I adjust the valves.  I haven't
had a gasket blowout or leak.  Maybe what's  happening in your case is when
you lift the bail over the cover you might be shifting the cover upward
slightly, causing the gasket to shift and not seal correctly.  I coat the
cover side of the gasket with a little grease so that it sticks slightly to
the cover, carefully position the cover over the head and then position it.
When I'm sure it's in place I hold the cover firmly against the head with
one hand and with the other, raise the bail sometimes with the use of a
screwdriver.   I think I also place a little downward force on the cover so
it doesn't shift up when I'm bringing the bail over it.

This has always worked for me.  Maybe your used to the black gaskets that
don't shift as much?  Another possibility I have no personal experience
with, but I've heard that cheaper aftermarket bails are not made of the
correct spring steel material so they don't hold as well. 

I usually buy cork gaskets in large quantities at the meets so I get an even
cheaper price. I can't comment on their reliability over 3k miles since mine
get changed at that point.  I like using grease to position the gasket since
the cleanup of the cover at tuneup time is as easy as wiping it with a rag.

Good luck,

Ron
