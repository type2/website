&gt; I have a engine door for a bus.  It measures 13.25&quot; x 37.5&quot;.  Does
&gt; anyone know if this is for a late model bus or a barndoor?  Its too
&gt; small for both my 68 or my 69.  Its in great shape rust wise and I
&gt; need to sell it.
SOunds like a 72 or 73 cover. That is why the mechanics hate these busses 
so much because the door opening was toosmall to work effectively. I 
think 72s lack the inside top engine cover and so is the worst yesar to 
work on in terms of space -but i am just going on memory becasue I own a 69

Hope this helps
