First, smell the oil.  Tranny oil has a very characteristic odor.  It
is probably engine oil, and you probably broke the oil filler down at
the bottom of the engine when you were working on the alternator (I am 
assuming that this is a typeIV, since I could only change my old bus
alternator by pulling the engine).  The tube is plastic, breaks easy and
will pour oil out real fine.
