Subject: Speaking of fuel pumps....

Caught the thread the other day about fuel pumps.  I just finished 
replacing a hose and installing a new fuel filter on my bus .  NOW it 
runs great.  Unfortunately, I  made a newbie mistake (one I made 4 years 
ago) once again.  I forgot that VW fuel systems are GRAVITY FED unlike 
that in my F*rd truck.  You can imagine the fun of cleaning that mess up. 

I read in a post about a ratcheting fuel line clamp.  It's gotta work 
better than the vise grip. 

What is it and where would I get one?

Thanks,

BEN
