Here's a curiosity..  Everyone talks about how gutless the upright motor
is.  I will make no claims to huge power, but mine with a Brazillian 009,
and an otherwise stock 71 setup does 70 in the flats pretty handily, does
lose speed up hills if my rpms are wrong, and gets me about 22 mpg + or -
my mood. My mileage gets better if I keep it under 60.  I will admit to
having an unknown year later (pancake) transmission.  Is all of this due to
the 009, the tranny or what????


Have at it of Dieties of the List...

The Tromper
71 Transporter (The Bounty)
82 Diesel Vanagon (unnamed)
82 diesel sunroof(parts)
