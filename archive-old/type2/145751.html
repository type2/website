Subject: Re: [T2] bolts

i used my own bolts for those triangles.... find you a short bolt that will match up with a 13mm nut and wrench it together....
  mine have been holding this way for quiet sometime...
  hardware store should have the little short fat bolts you need for this....
  i had lots of trouble finding little things like that to order so hardware store or lowes bolt section....
