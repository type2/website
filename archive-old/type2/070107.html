Subject: Conclusion-1600DP stuck plug

Mucho thanks to those of you who offered advice on my stuck spark plug.  The
common advice suggested trying to remove the plug with the engine warm (not
hot).  I did remove the plug on Saturday after warming the engine up.  It
was very hard to get out, causing a blister on the palm of my hand.  When I
got it out, it obviously brought some aluminum threads with it.

Ever optimistic, I oiled up my new Bosch Platinum plug and gingerly started
it in the remaining threads.  It took.  I threaded it in all the way, and
then tightened it just a tad more (per Muir) to seat the seal.  I've now
driven it over 100 miles and it's still in there.  I changed all the other
plugs without problem.  Valves probably should be done in 10-20k miles.  The
plugs will stay in there till then.  At that point, I'll have the plug
threads fixed right.

On a side note, for about the last 3 weeks it seemed that the engine was
missing from about 54-58 mph.  No problems any other time, and only on a
straight and level cruise.  Made me think of carburetor circuits, spark
plugs, wires, distributor &amp; other possibilities.  This morning on the way to
work, cruising straight and level, all of a sudden it was like the key was
turned off.  I pulled off the road and looked at the engine.  The nut
holding the connector and wires to the positive side of the coil had come
off, and also the wires.  I couldn't find the nut, and didn't have a spare,
so I just took my little alligator clip jumper wire and jumpered between the
wires and coil.  Everything's fine.  In fact, the missing symptoms are gone.
I'd guess that the nut was loose for the last few weeks, causing
intermittent power to the coil at that &quot;cruising&quot; rpm.

Another lesson learned.

Thanks again,
Dean
