&gt; Is the tranny thats used in the 68-71 bus and the 72-79 the same ? If not,
&gt; how can you tell them apart? I know the later tranny is a two piece. I have
&gt; a friend with a mid 70's bus, so we are wondering if the 68-71 tranny would
&gt; work.

David:
It's WAY more complicated than that! 68-mid 69 are the same, mid 69 + 70 are
the same, 71 is the same as 70 with a slightly different bellhousing, 72 has a
different bellhousing again, and different input shaft,  73... I can't
remember, 74 and 75 have different ratios, but 75 case is a little different
than 74. 76-79 are a LOT different, enough to warrant a different type number
(091 vs 002 of the earlier ones) bigger gears, bigger r+p, different ratios
again. It goes on up thru Vanagons, basically every time the engine changes,
the trans changes. Partly because of torque curves and requirements, sometimes
to build them easier i.e., cheaper. (091/1)
Give me specific years and engine sizes.
Actually, I'd never use anything earlier on a type 4 engine than a 76
trans.Really, I'd recommend changing to custom air cooled Vanagon 3rd and 4th
gears on a 2 liter bay window bus.
Some of these changes are ratio differences, some are bigger changes.
If you're just trying to get the bus to move under its own power, that's a
little different.
David Schwarze can probably fill in some of the gaps in my database.
