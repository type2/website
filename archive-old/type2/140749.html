Subject: Type 1 engine into a Type 4 bus

Ok this REALLY intrigues me, because of the cost diff between a 2L Type4 and
a Type1 part list.
If we could lean on our Brit or European brothers to help us out, we could
find out what trans ratios there were in the Type 1 engine equipped
vehicles.
1) I take it there are no reduction gears in the Bays using the Type1?
2) Would the Type1 engine bolt up to the Type4 trans in my 77 2.0L engine?
3) Where does one purchase the fibreglass &quot;tin&quot; required to do this?
4) Bet I can rebuild a 1915CC Type1 twice, for the price of one Type4 :-)

Simple minds would like to know.
Courtney
