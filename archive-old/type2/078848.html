Subject: [T2] two weld q's, one spec to DC

&gt;stevo sends:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; hi listees, kelly,  - welding questions: i have a stress crack i'd like to
&gt;&gt; nip and wonder what would be the best welding method to repair it. two
&gt;&gt; inches, passenger side door, above the side mirror. i've heard a braze
&gt;&gt; would be best, but a neighbor has oxy acetylene and is glad to do it. i'm
&gt;&gt; unsure that might be too hot.
&gt;
&gt;IMHO, MIG is the only way to go.  Regular gas welding, as well as brazing,
&gt;puts way too much heat into the metal, and you can pretty much count on it
&gt;warping and making a big mess of things.  I would also be concerned about
&gt;the longevity of a brazed repair in the area you are talking about, due to
&gt;vibration and stress, and the fact that you are talking about a butt joint
&gt;with no overlap.  You are going to have to remove all of the flammmable
&gt;material (window channels, glass, etc.) in this area before welding, no
&gt;matter which method is used.  Most auto body shops have MIG equipment and
&gt;could do the welding for you. You could save $ by removing and re-installing
&gt;the the window channels &amp; such.

all good points well taken.  a butt weld done with oxy/acet, i left a
small-so-hard-to-tell ridge which is adaquate for me.  i hope it holds! it
is hidden by the mirror. i've been kinda torn since i hauled this truck out
of the trash: is it a work truck - how far should i take it?  today its a
work truck. i gotta hope its done....remember the john muir frontispiece!
if it does crack again, i will remember the MIG and do thank you in advance.

i was hoping to minimize re-opening the wound, so i drilled a hole with a
#53 bit at the bottom of the stress before welding hoping to ensure the
crack wouldn't travel. right now i'm fighting the urge to put the door back
together having sprayed paint six hours ago &lt;grit&gt;.

i did all the removals myself. i'm particular about my boneyard treasures.
i found the wcm door panel clip boots are hardly good for one time use
only. during removal i found they all buckeled and ripped upon installation
of the door panel. ya hit the tips of them with grease, and gently run 'em
through the holes in the door with a twist on a stick half the diameter of
a wooden skewer, BUT upon installation of the door panel, they fried on me.
i'll try greasing the clips this too time.  wcm supposedly sells orig vw
boots at a buck a piece. sheesh.     - steve
