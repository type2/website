Subject: Stewart Warner Gas Heater Question/Problem

I've looked though the manual but couldn't find my answer so am asking
the list.  
 
The spark plug to the heater does not fit snuggly.  I can pull it up
and down about an 1/8 of an inch.  There is a metal O ring on the top
side of the plug.  I'm assuming that the 1/8 inch play should not be
there?  Am I correct in my assumption?  I am wondering if I'm missing
another O ring on the bottom side or what?  Any help would greatly be
appreciated. 
 
I ask this question because I am having a problem with keeping the
heater going.  It will run nicely for awhile and then stop heating. 
It will start to blow cold air because the heater is not firing.  I go
back and wiggle the spark plug wire at the spark plug and it fires
right up.  The strange part is that the spark plug wire is like stuck
to the spark plug because it requires a little force to wiggle the
wire but then frees up right away.  It's got to be a bad connection
but I don't understand why because the spark plug wire is tight on the
spark plug.  
 
The heater is installed under my Z-bed so it doesn't take much to lift
the seat and wiggle the wire but it's not working the way it should so
any help would greatly be appreciated.
 
Thanks,
Kevin
