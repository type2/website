Underneath the oil it can't hurt much, it's sealed in there. It's the
pooling in the cylinders that'll get ya. You may be in for rings corroded
fast to the cylinders (this is why you can't turn the crank and it makes it
a size nine bitch to get the cylinders off) and maybe for serious head
deterioration. Aluminum doesn't rust, but that doesn't mean it doesn't
corrode. It corrodes. It can corrode very muchly.

yup, and old oil will corrode  cases too.   I brought back a 25 long block,
with the heads already removed, but the cylinders are stuck solid.   The
bottom of the case was corroded from the old oil turning acidic or something,
and had holes in it, which I enlarged with a hammer.   Inside were handfuls
of what seemed to be sand mixed with oil, but was probably aluminium bits
with oil.   Hey, that would have burned well.    So i'm going to liberally
douse  the cylinders and pistons with penetrating oil for a week or so, apply
heat, and try to get them apart agin.   If that doesn't work, I'll take a
grinders to the case.  Ha ha ha ha !!!!!!!
