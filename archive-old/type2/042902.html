&gt; ...  We then took that little useless flip-down door on the front of the
&gt; bench seat cabinet (under the seats) and put it in the garage rafters.  We
&gt; then secured the wood to the front of the bench cabinet with one screw in
&gt; the top centre so that the speaker magnets poked into the door opening
(but did not take up any space in the storage space).... 

What a good idea. That little drawer is truly useless, since one flips up 
the seat to get anything out of there anyways.

What a very good idea. You rock, sir.
