Subject: [T2] Parts

I have acquired a '71 Bus that I will probably cannibalize for spare
parts for our '71 Camper.  There are some parts on it that I will not
want and some of you list members might be able to use.  This bus
had an air conditioner on it.  The compressor is missing, but the
evaporator unit is still there as are the overhead controls inside the
bus.  It also has a middle and rear seat that I have no need for.  In
addition, I have a front grille from a '73 bus that is in decent condition.
The things I need are:  ignition coil, starter motor, VW engine stand.
With these items I can take the engine from the 'spare '71 bus' and
rebuild it for a spare for our camper.  So, does anyone have any of
these items for trade/swap??  If so, send me a p-mail.  We are in
Apex, NC (12 miles from Raleigh) and I could arrange delivery in my
pick-up within a reasonable distance.
