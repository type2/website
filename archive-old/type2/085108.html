Subject: RE: repair reservoir

What's wrong?

The fact that you could have found a good used, 1-year-only part, for $15
AND you paid $30 for a repair kit. I would only recommend the $30 repair kit
to those who cannot find a good used, 1-year-only part, for $15. Which seems
to be quite a few people.

&gt; 
&gt; I just spent $30.00 on a &quot;maybe it will work&quot; repair set-up, 
&gt; and I could have found a good used one, that doesn't leak for 
&gt; $15.00-----
&gt; 
&gt; What's wrong with this picture?
