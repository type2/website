Subject: [T2] dash cracks

sorry about the blank. I had to rid my pc of aol 6.0, all should be well now.
    I have a small crack behind the passenger grab handle and was hoping 
someone could recomend a product to repair it before it gets to big.  What 
are you folks using to preserve the dash?
Thanks
ronnie
