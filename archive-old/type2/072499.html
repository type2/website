Subject: Questions about replacing generator with an alternator

 I'm having problems with my charging system on my 1600 dp engine and believe it is the generator.  I have a junk engine that has the alternator on it so after trying to replace the brushes tonight in the generator, if I still have problems plan on doing the replacement.  I love the type2 library and have printed and read several times the article on the replacement but still have a question about the fuel pump.  

Do I need to replace that or just the pump push rod?  I'm not sure the fuel pump is good on my junk engine.  I read the part that Ron and Dale wrote about and am confused.  Can anyone clarify this for me?  Also anyone who has done this can you tell me how long it took you to do this and any other tricks that might be helpful.

Thanks
