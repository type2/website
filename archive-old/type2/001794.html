Can anyone tell me where the reversing light switch is?  I have found loose
wires in the engine bay, the third wire coming off the coil ( no fuse) but
can't find switch on the transmission housing.

Heading out tomorrow for the first run of the year having sorted out
everything but this one!

Any fast answers?
