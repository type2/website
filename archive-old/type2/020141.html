&gt; 3. My oil light doesnt seem to work.

How about replacing the bulb?

&gt; 4. Is there anything I should tune differently or any adjustments I should
&gt; make for the cold temperatures?

Adjust your choke and make sure it is working.  You may have to pump the pedal
two or three times in the real cold.

&gt;  I cant get my bus into first once the outside air hits 45F.

Adjust clutch, adjust shifter, pilot bearing may be losing its lubrication and
hanging up.  With the bus stopped, the clutch disengaged, the gears should not
be turning.  Can you put it in 2, 3, or 4 to stop the gears then into first?

Good trip,

Mike D.
