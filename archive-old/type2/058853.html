Subject: Oil Pressure - Temperature mystery
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Howdy,

I have had a continuing problem with the oil pressure and temperature with
my 2.0. The engine is a stock 78 that was rebuilt by Mark Stephens motors.
It currently has about 6k on it. The problem is this-

When the engine gets over 200 degrees the oil pressure at idle goes away. I
am running a VDO system and at temperature the gauge reads zero and the
idiot light fires up. At running speed approx 3400 rpm I show an indicated
25psi. I attached a mechanical gauge with a tee and ran the engine until it
read 210 degrees. The high speed pressure shows 45 psi on the mechanical
gauge versus 25 on the electric gauge. That made me feel better. The idle on
the other hand reads 0 on both gauges, the tubing for the mechanical gauge
is even void of oil. Now I know you are going to tell me that all is bad,
but, I really don't think that this is a true internal oil pressure based on
the following observations.

The engine remains quite- no rattling lifters
no obnoxious signs of scoring or damage such as metal in the oil
It has run for 6000 miles like this.

Now my theory is this- 
This problem was much worse when the engine was first installed ( no need to
hash out the &quot;warranty&quot; process with MSHP just look in the archives under &quot;I
want to kill someone&quot; or something similar). After much gnashing of teeth
and troubleshooting we found the oil pressure relief valve under the cooler
to be a gummed up varnished piece of junk. I cleaned it up and things
improved to the point were I can drive it. I am wondering if this valve
could be leaking enough to allow low pressure low flow conditions to route
around the seat. Another indication is that this engine will overheat at
idle, signifying low/no flow of oil to the cooler at low pressure. I guess I
am looking for some form of reinforcement for my theory and barring that
some questions answered to help me.

Do all pancake engines overheat at idle? It seems to me that my 1600 ran
cool at idle.
Is this valve rebuildable?
Is there a kit available? I haven't been able to find one.
Is there another place on the engine I could check the pressure outside of
the cooler and filter galley?


Any help would be appreciated.

TIA
Clay
