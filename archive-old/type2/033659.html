Subject: trade me 4 set of solex dual carbs??

as the above subject states.  i need a rebuildable set of dual solex
carbs.  will trade either a complete weber progressive for a type iv, or
for a super clean set (with manifolds, linkage,etc.) will possibly trade
a gas heater i recently got and have yet to install.  possibly a bit of
$$$$ to throw in also!!

let me know..
thanks,
zzz
