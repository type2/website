Subject: 75 to 74 front bumper also email addy change

First off my email address is changing for anyone keeping track.  the new
address is vwsnoopy_at_comcast_dot_net

Secondly,
Is there any reason why a 75 front bumper wouldn't fit on a 74?  I am
trying to line up the bolt holes and they just don't seem to line up.
Bent a little maybe?? It looks like I am going to have to drill new holes
:((

Thanks,
Snoopy
