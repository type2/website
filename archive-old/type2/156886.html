Subject: Re: [T2] starter problem?

&gt; I do like the idea of a remote starter switch in the
&gt; engine compartment.
&gt; Mate that with a separate switch to energize the
&gt; ignition too. Should be
&gt; very simple to do. Just make sure there's some way
&gt; to lock it so nobody
&gt; figures it out and steals your bus. (A locking hatch
&gt; would probably be
&gt; fine.)

I do like the addition of a relay to activate the
solenoid (and a relay for the relay for the relay?)
and if you do add a relay, you can also add a switch
in the engine compartment, providing a full
battery-strength path to the relay... I did have some
times that the voltage was too low 'through the loop'
to activate the relay! A person could use a key-switch
for this if you're concerned about it being used to
steal the bus, but having a separate starter button
helps for stuff like adjusting points where you don't
want the coil powered up.

A side note: I have just recently added a computer
reset switch to my bus. {Not necessary or even useful
for stock FI, by the way} I set it up so that in
normal mode, the relay is closed and the computer has
power. To reset, I just activate the relay via a
switch in the driver area and it opens the circuit for
the computer. After a few seconds, the computer resets
to default mode, gets fresh readings from all the
sensors, and away we go! Yes, it does work (for the
Subaru - and your &quot;other car&quot; if it suddenly starts
acting strange!)
I used a momentary switch and placed it in the front
kick panel but am planning to change it to a mini
toggle switch so I can use it as an emergency
disabling device - able to tap it with my foot as I
bail out!
Earlier plans were to use three switches in a row with
computer keyboard type keys labeled &quot;ALT - CTRL - DEL&quot;

Why have the reset switch? I am not using all the
engine control devices that the Subaru had on it
originally and certain situations cause the computer
to switch to either &quot;last good signal&quot; mode or &quot;limp
home mode&quot; for some functions. It rarely happens -
mostly associated with the lack of any of the
cold-start apparatus
