&gt; Back in VT without my westy :(  From a compression test it seems like I broke 
&gt; a ring and the tick through out the rpm range and the smoke after you rev it 
&gt; up.  So my question is I do not have any prior history to about the motor so 
&gt; not sure if I should try to drop the motor and replace the rings to get her 
&gt; home probaly breaking all kinds of studs opening up a big can of worms. Still 

where is &quot;here&quot; and where is &quot;home&quot; and where in VT is which one???

in other words were is the bus and where do you want it to be?

an engine you've never dropped and you've never dropped an engine I would
want to learn in a friendly spot, like my garage...it can be and has been
done but really not a recommended prochedure for a first time.

the odds are good that you could get the bus a few miles without damage,
or even accross the country, but it would be a real risk

&gt;  Anybody on the east have a good 2L  they want to part with for a reasonable 

probably could rent a truck and trailer from U-haul or one of the other
guys and tow it home for less than what an engine would cost, and then you
would still have the drop engine problem and any new engine I don't care
how good it is will have a few run in glitches that will need to be worked
out...some simple some not so simple...

&gt; price? Sorry to ramble just all stressed cause it's so far away and don't 

BTDT

&gt; have any vw connections in that area.  Any suggestions on what to do are 

I still lean to the &quot;tow it&quot; option if at all possible.
(and is best to tow it with all four wheels off the ground if any
distance)

good luck
Bob
