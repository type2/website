Subject: LEDs for Westys

Awhile back, someone on the list stated they were &quot;building&quot; Led pods for VW
vans.  Can that person contact me, since I am doing similar work, and have run
into problems, and maybe that persons knowledge will help me avoid some
&quot;issues&quot;, in this endeavor.  Thanks
Sid
