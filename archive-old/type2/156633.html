&gt; thanks alot guys for the info.  i also have a
&gt; problem on the othe side of
&gt; the heat exchangers.  both of the connections to the
&gt; heater channels are
&gt; rusted through and on the passenger side of the bus
&gt; the cable is rusted
&gt; completely in two and the  pipe that the cable
&gt; connects to is not even
&gt; there.  should i leave the hole on the other side of
&gt; the heat exchanger open
&gt; or should i close them up with the roofing flashing
&gt; too. or is replacing
&gt; those two up tubes to the heater chaneels worth the
&gt; money, even if i will
&gt; never use the  heater
&gt; 
If you're never going to use the heat, seal off any
holes into / out of the engine compartment. This will
improve the cooling of the engine.

Closing off the passages that I mentioned earlier,
from the bottom of the fan housing (T4 motor) to the
heat exchangers will increase the pressure / flow to
the engine cooling as none will be wasted going to the
heat exchangers.

If the engine tin is for an AC version, I think the
bottom plate is different also and there may be a
gaping hole where the compressor was. You may need to
shop for one or two pieces of &quot;normal&quot; tin to keep the
pressure of cooling air up where it needs to be. I
simply do not remember which pieces were different on
the AC version or how different they were. Hope this
helps. -BaH
