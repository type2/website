Subject: Husbands, Busses, Obsessions

Oh Ya!  This topic hit some nerves.  I've enjoyed the responses and thought 
I'd add.
My husband is a diesel mechanic and he loves turning a wrench esp. on our van,
buss, and bug.  He always helps other VW owners out with their problems in a
good samartian and learn more way.  I admire these traits, wish I could 
participate
more in our maintainence ,am always eger to help etc.  We drive our VW'S  
many miles with our whole family (dogs, kids etc.) and have never suffered a 
breakdown.
Because of My husbands love and admiration for our VW's we've had the most 
incredable adventures.  Good family memories.  I feel his excitement, 
concern,and love. I think its great.  He's sexy in is coveralls with grease 
and fuel coatings and what strong hands.  Anyway, GET INVOLVED with your 
loved one and your VW'
it's up to us to keep these good-vibe vehicles on the rode and out of the 
junk yards.
 Mother Green  P.S. I love you and your obsession,MG.
