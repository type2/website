   Sorry that you got my earlier message.It was intended for my brother
in Ok. He has a 71 westfalia to sell and I had sent him the wrong
address(as I now found out).I had put it up with his address so I could
copy it on to the letter I was sending &amp; forgot to take it back out when
I got done. I am a v.w. nut for all aircooled types.  It wil not happen
again.i am new to this webt.v. stuff.

P.J.
