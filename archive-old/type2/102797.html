Subject: Re: [T2] Bosch H4 ... and less expensive alternatives

Richard--

And you are correct on the fit of these lamps--they are a loose fit--and
are loose in the buckets--

I had to lay a bead of silicone all the way around the back side of the
bucket and let it harden up to keep them from rattling.

Phooey--!!

JC Whitney material--

Later,

Terry

 
E-mail message   
 

They fit just fine in my 82 vanagon.....I did have trouble with one of
them leaking and getting water in it. I returned it and Ron sent me
another one that was good. These knock-offs are made in India 
but they have been working just fine in my vehicle for 5 years with no
problems. 

I searched the archives some more and it seems back in 1999 there were
some imported that had the wrong tabs so perhaps it was just some old
stock and that picture is out of date.
