Subject: Engine question - '76 bus

I'm a newbie to this list and it's always great to see other people into
great automobiles!

I own a '76 campmobile(green) with the original engine and a rebuilt
tranny.  I just purchased another '76 bus(orange) that doesn't have all
the stuff mine does (only has sink and no fridge).  Now, my first bus,
the green one, is dying slowly.  We lived in chicago for ten years so
the whole body is rusting through :(  Lucky for me, I found the orange
on and bought it.

Because they are both exactly the same year models, I would like to take
the best parts of both models and make one really good van.  The tranny
in the orange one grinds going into third, so I'm probably going to take
the green one and put it in the orange one.  Now, the engine in the
orange one is a rebuilt (with 11,000 on it) and the green one is the
original (160,000).

What I am trying to figure out is which engine is a better engine.  I
know the green one is obviously older, but is it worth it to rebuild it
and put it in the orange bus and sell the orange's engine?  The engine
numbers are the following:

My first bus (green): GD 023716 (original, has 160,000 miles)
New bus (orange): GD 007445 (rebuilt, has 11,000 miles)

Now, because the engine numbers on green one has a higher number than
the orange one, does that mean that it is a later model/better model? 
Are the parts interchangeable between the two models?  One of the
differences that I noticed was that the green one has little things like
the micro switch on the throttle housing and the orange one doesn't. 
Also the air intake sensors have different model numbers.. any thoughts?

If anyone has any suggestions, let me know!  I looked at the library and
found some info but I just want to confirm.

Thanks,
Mike Soultanian
