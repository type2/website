Subject: Fuel Pumps

I finally got my bus going again, and now the fuel pump dies:(   I just 
checked the store all around here (SEA.) and the average $ is 250.00 OUCH!  I 
think that's lutacris.......   Anyway,   how does everyone feel about Used 
pumps?  IF I were to use this last resort, I will buy two of them (hell for 
price I could buy 15 pumps).
