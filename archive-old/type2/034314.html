Subject: My &quot;free&quot;  tranny removal tool

My first tool for tranny removal cost nothing- picked up a 19mm (socket
size) bolt taken from an engine mount at the junk yard (about 3&quot; long),
stuck it in a vise,  and hit it with a torch, bending it 90 degr. near
the hex end.  Stick it inside a 3/8&quot; iron plumbing pipe and have at that
drain plug!  Other forms are the GIANT allen wrench and my favorite, a
3/8&quot; socket with the hex shape at one end.

&gt; I forgot to mention that JCRipme has the cool tool for doing REd Gear
&gt; and Tranny plugs.  It costs a whole $2.95.  Worth the money.  It's one
&gt; of those things I usually give to a new 'trainee' who wants to learn
&gt; about how to maintain a bus.
