Subject: Seat Belts in a 63 singlecab ?

Tim is repainting &amp; fixing the bodywork on my 63 singlecab.
This is the year where the spare tire is in the cargo area.
The seating arrangement is a bench in the front with a single seat for the 
driver and a double seat for the passenger(s)
It has no seatbelts right now.

My thoughts are to add plates with nuts welded to the plates, so that I can 
install, retractable shoulder belts for the driver &amp; passenger. There would 
be one plate one the door pillar by one's ear, and two on the floor. I 
realise that this is not an original restoration, but I think it is a good 
idea.
Then it would have diagonal retractable belts for the driver &amp; one passenger 
and a lap belt for the middle passenger.

Any suggestions for the belt types to be quasi-VW.
The belts in my 70 westy are not retractable, but it would be neat if they 
were, so I am thing retractable belts.

I saw a thread that suggested JC Wipime belts, any other suggestions.
