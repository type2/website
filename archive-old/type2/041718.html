Volks,

Thanks for the responses. I tried setting initial timing at 7.5 BTDC with
the 009 and Pertronix.

Came up with a total advance of 28 degrees _at_ 3200 rpm. Is that close enough
or should I advance a little more.

By the way. Much smoother throttle and no more Brrrrrrmmmmm Pugh,
Brrrrrrmmmmm Pugh.

Thank you, thank you, thank you...
