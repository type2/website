I think it might be the area.  When I drive my Bus around (I'm 30
minutes -south- of Atlanta) I get strange looks, a couple waves, always waves from other AC VW owners.  When I drove a Bus up in the Chicago area, no one ever gave it a second look.  I also remember seeing more of them up there...

So what's up with hot 'lanta? I'm in california, self-described vw hotbed, and busdrivers give me the shaft when I wave 8 times outta 10.

Course, this is self-described yuppie hotbed as well. Also, being in the central valley, I sometimes think there's more rednecks here than the whole south. Don't take kindly to non 4x4 modes of travel.

Yeehaw,

Billy
