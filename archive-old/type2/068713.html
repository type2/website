&gt;The fan motor is frozen (Like H Steven said) but, not wholly so it turns,
&gt;but sticks and backs up and blows the fuse right away.  Need new motor.

Emily,
I wonder if anyone has yet tried to replace the engine compartment fan with a
bilge blower (or two!). Maybe you're destined to be the guinea pig. I'd try to
clean out the motor and fan with solvent first, tho. Sounds like it might be
just gummed up a little.
