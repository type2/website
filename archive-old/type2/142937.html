Subject: Re: [T2] It's not fixed.

&gt; Oh well. The other thing that happened to mine that caused a similar
&gt; symptom was that the little brass disk you see in the middle of the
&gt; throat as you look down the right carb broke off and went through the
&gt; engine. Couldn't get the rest of the part out, so had to change carb
&gt; bodies. Too much of a fluke to be likely in your case too....

You're not talking about the throttle butterfly are you?

I'll go look though. I haven't paid much attention to that carb other
than checking for vacuum leaks and float level. Maybe it's time to
tear it down.
