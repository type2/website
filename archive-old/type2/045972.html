Subject: [T2] 69 Westy wooden headliner

Good morning from Cali.

So I've managed to remove all the camping equipment from the bus, strip the
paint, remove the windows and poptop, sand down the interior and exterior
to remove rust, replace all the insulation, repaint the interior (a really
tasteful cream color), get new doors (thanks Justin!), and now I'm working
on the &quot;cab&quot; area, and refinishing the cabinets and wood trim.   I've been
able to salvage all of the wooden trim, except for the very large piece
covering the area over the driver and passenger seats, with the dome light.
  I've looked in all the catalogs, but this part does not seem to be
available...  Any ideas where I may obtain this?   I'm also looking for
recommendations for places that sell attractive veneers.

Thanks in advance,

Jason


P.S.   For everyone that responded about the stuck doors, thanks!   Liquid
Wrench and an impact wrench works wonders.  And I only hit my hand with the
BFH once!
