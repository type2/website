&gt; The authorized Nokian dealers told me flat out that

This has been my experience as well. If you can get a local dealer to  
source the tire, expect to pay unbelievably high prices. I got tired  
of calling dealers and educating them about these tires.

Some websites you might find useful:

* USA site (used to be a worthless source of info until a couple of  
months ago):
- http://nokiantires_dot_com/en/

* UK site (where I used to go for info):
- http://nokiantyres_dot_com/

* Nokian datasheet website:
- http://nokian.materials.fi/

* These guys can order all the bus rated tires and ship them from the  
Nokian warehouse in TN:
