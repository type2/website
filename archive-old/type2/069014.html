Subject: Splitty rescue tools

        Joe,
        No CVs or boots- swing axle if its a Splittie, unless hopped up.

        If its really running regularly, then you don't need a can
to dump the bad gas into, but a real salvage operation you'd want one.

        I'd bring a hose, sponges, squeegee, bucket &amp; soap, and
a scrub-brush. I dunno, maybe some people would prefer it to be
dusty when first fired up... but driving home clean is fun too.

        Battery postive and ground straps and a new tranny ground braid?

        I'd bring a brake bleeding tool like the one I've described
too many times AND a vaccuum pump. Use the vaccuum pump to draw
fluid out of the system, rather than pumping, unless you already
plan to replace the master cylinder or its seals- old master
cylinders tend to tear when pumped vigorously after a lot of
crud has settled in the bore... if the system's solid but the
fluid's filthy, this would make a difference.

        Bill
