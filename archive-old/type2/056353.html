Subject: Ballast Resistors

Hi All,

I've got a bit of a problem.  2 of the wires on the ballast resistor of my
1981 Westy have broken away from the unit.  I have another from a 1980 but
1 of the wires is broken away from it :-(  I was wondering if there is any
way to repair either of the ballast resistors or to take them apart and
make one good one from both of them.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
