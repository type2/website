Subject: Beautiful 66 Kombi for sale in Toronto NVC
X-Sent-From: pokey_at_vanagon_dot_org

I just got back from looking at a beutiful rust free 1966 Kombi that I saw advertized on www.trader_dot_ca.

I had seen the van in my neighbourhood before and I had to go take a look. It really was great looking, the only problem being that the interior was really just the two front seats. I can't justify spending the money on this van now... but as any true enthusiast I cannot resist the urge to help this van find a good home. If you have been looking for a rust free Splittie in Ontario... I doubt you wil find a finer example. 

If you want to find it on www.trader_dot_ca search trucks for volkswagen... there are only seven listed. Here is a copy of the ad text (there is a photo on trader):
