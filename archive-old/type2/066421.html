Subject: Engine Stand Question

I'm going to be doing my first rebuild this winter on a 1500 H series
motor for my 65 Deluxe Bus. For the home rebuilder does anyone have any
comments on the engine stand model that bolts to a workbench -
specifically the JCWhitney model. Is it satisfactory or should I spend a
little more for a free-standing one. The cost for this bench mount model
is only $23.98 on sale now. I'd like any input/advice before I order it.
Thanks,
