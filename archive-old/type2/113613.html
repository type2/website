Subject: Wire crimpers

Those are it. Looks like those handles aren't color coded but things vary 
from brand to brand.  Channellock is a good brand here. Heavy comfortable 
tool. The rubber handles haven't slipped on mine which is a pet peeve for 
me...

Here's mine:

These are pretty decent strippers. Not very heavy for crimping though.

The ones I stay away from are the ones made from 1/8&quot; stamped steel, often 
black or chrome plated. Most often found here in connector kits where you 
get 500 connectors and these crimpers for $10. Beware... &lt;grin&gt;

I'm not a &quot;tool snob&quot; &lt;grin&gt; and I won't say you've got to buy the $50 
pliers but there is a significant difference in the cheapie pliers and a 
decent set. If we were professional mechanics or electricians we'd probably 
see the value of the $50 pliers but the cheaper ones will last a shadetree 
mechanic a lifetime. The cheapest pliers might make it through the weekend. 
Not that they'd break but that I'd throw them into the river out of 
frustration.

Hope this helps.




&gt;That piece you wrote on the wiring of the headlights
&gt;was spot on.  I recently researched this at length and
&gt;ended up running two fused hot wires from the battery
&gt;directly to two new relays, one for high, one for low.
&gt;  Switched by the original loop.  Put new sealed units
&gt;and halogen globes and its like a white xmas out
&gt;there, clear white bright light.
&gt;
&gt;Can you point me further in the right direction for
&gt;the crimping pliers.  Im looking for the crimping tool
&gt;that gives a finished crimp like an oem loom.  Im in
&gt;Australia and have had no luck finding the cheaper
&gt;shops online... -found a german tool for a second
&gt;mortgage!
