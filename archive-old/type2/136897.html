A friend of mine suggested that the 71 when to front discs and power assisted
braking in order to have it classified as a light truck as opposed to
paasenger vehicle in order to ease the emissions restrictions on imports.
Don't know if there's any truth in this, but it's another antecdotal
obersavtion on why the change.
