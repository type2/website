Subject: RE: [T2] spare tire and bus jack

&gt; I ordered the &quot;white with black piping&quot; spare tire cover from
&gt; Bus Depot and it does NOT fit good. It is too big around for the stock 14&quot;
&gt; tire on my '72 and looks baggy. It is not a snug fit.

&gt; Maybe a dumb question but.....
&gt; What is the size of the stock 14&quot; tire on the front of your bus?
&gt; 185R14 or 185/??R14?



And therein lies the problem. Not everyone uses the 185R14 that VW
originally put on the bus. Many people use a slightly larger tire.  In order
to accommodate a wide range of busses,  bus tire covers do tend to be just
slightly larger than what would be absolutely neccessary for a
&quot;fits-like-a-glove&quot; fit on a 185R14.  Otherwise, half of the bus owners
couldn't use them.  I guess it's in the eye of the beholder; I didn't find
it too baggy on my bus when I used it with a stock tire, and I haven't had
any other complaints out of the few hundred I sell a year. In fact, some
vendors sell bus tire covers that are noticable larger than mine (for no
good reason in my opinion).

However...
I will be getting a small shipment of tire covers from a new supplier whom I
am trying out,  in a couple of weeks.  Who knows, perhaps they are slightly
smaller, perhaps not.  (Although I can't say I particularly want them to be,
as I am happy with the size we're shipping now).  In any event, I'll post a
follow-up once I look them over.
