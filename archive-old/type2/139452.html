Subject: Refurbished?

Anyone know whether anybody has tried to provide &quot;refurbished&quot; buses 
(or any vehicle, for that matter)? It would be nice to go to a 
refurbisher -- not a restorer -- and buy a baywindow for, say, $6000 to 
$10000 with maybe a two-year parts and labor guarantee.

If someone did this is large quantities, it ought to be possible.
