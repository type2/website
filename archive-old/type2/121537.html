Subject: Re: [T2] wheels

&gt;Here's a fast solution--
&gt;Clean the whole wheel as good as possible--and it doesn't have to be
&gt;perfect--and paint them on both sides with SEM rust sheild--use the
&gt;hardener they recommend.
&gt;Bullet proof stuff--and  resonable in price too--

Hey Terry, is that the same stuff we used in the Navy that was sort of 
green and harder than a rock? Amazing stuff for the application. Literally 
had to chip it off (or use a grinder) if for some reason it needed to be 
removed.

Probably not good to use under paint but I'd use it on the underside of my 
bus in a second. I could of course topcoat it with a color.
