&gt;I suggest the Ghia mailing list as a great resource for clock info.  They

&gt;understand that each and every Ghia came with a VDO clock.

Lucky devils.

&gt;BTW, my reading there has informed me that the VDO clock is really a wind-up
&gt;mechanical clock.  The electrical component just turns the mechanical
&gt;winder.  Not sure if we are talking the same basic clocks, but I believe we
&gt;are...

Sometime in the mid 70's they changed from the wind-up clock to a quartz
one (that has a real loud ticking sound, btw).  The one quartz one I've
seen had a black face and say &quot;quartz&quot; on them, while the windup ones I've
seen have a grey face.
