Hey guys and gals-

I'm sure a heap of you are wondering who the hell I am... I'm the guy who 
made the rust, noise, heat in your VW site.( 
http://bulley-hewlett_dot_com/Vwindex/ )  ...maybe four or five still know the 
name. I miss being on the list(s), but still can't find the time. Still 
have the 1982 Westy with the sweet, balanced 2.1 liter aircooled motor. Our 
escape pod.

Since I didn't pull the South Padre Island Millenium VW celebration 
together, I thought I'd offer a snapshot into what I'm up to, for those who 
are sober enough tonight to read e-mail.

Many blessings for health, prosperity, and safety in the New Year,
