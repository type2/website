Subject: [T2] A note on aging FI systems

Volks,
I received the following interesting comment on troubleshooting old
fuel-injection systems. I'm forwarding it with Ron's permission.
I should probably add a page on just these sorts of problems. Feel free to
send me your contributions and hard-earned knowledge on what one should know
that is not mentioned in the official troubleshooting manuals.

Subject: cold start problems

I was looking at your site for troubleshooting FI systems in VW's and I
thought this might be of significance to some peoplpe.  I am in the process
of bringing a '78 bus back into running condition after sitting for some 8
years.  I finally got it running and then I had to use ether to get it to
start from cold.  As I began to trace the problem I pulled off the connector
to the cold start injector and noticed the connectors had recessed into the
connector probably because of the stiffness from age.  I worked the
connectors out by massaging the wire and slipped the connector on.  The
engine started right up.  I have run into some of these &quot;crazy&quot; things which
you never see in the troubleshooting procedure.  I have heard so much about
how these FI systems become problematic with age and yet conversely they are
praised for their excellent engineering.  I believe the latter and most
problems are not researched enough to trace the problem.  Thanks for a nice
article and troubleshooting procedure.  Ron Colosi  -  Boston
