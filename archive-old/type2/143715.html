Hi guys,

   My bus is 1974.  It has the 1800cc engine.  The
distributor is 0231 181 005.  

I can't seem to get the engine to run right.  I wanted
to drive it home this weekend about 100 miles, since I
just graduated from college.  It seems to be running
rich (black gassy plugs and pop pop pop from the
exhaust).  I also notice sometimes when i am messing
wit it if i rev the engine on the way back down in
rpm's the carbs will cough back up?  

I pulled the right carb off the engine (solex 34-
pdist-3) because it had air leaks at the main gasket. 
I replaced the gasket cleaned up the carb.  Put it
back on and not difference.

Any suggestions?

jason
