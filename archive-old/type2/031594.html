READ AND HEED

think it is just us folks, today Valley Motors (VW, Porsche, Audi, MB) in
Baltimore Maryland was blown up, literally, by a mechanic working on a
fuel tank.  fortunately no serious injuries but the dealership is &quot;out of
business&quot; for at least a week, 6 cars totally destroyed, many others
damaged... the shop building wing is probably totally destroyed and is
expected to be condemned.  this is a rather large and old dealership, they
even still had the AC microfiches still avaliable, I used em a few times,
still one or two old mechanics who would consider looking at the air
cooleds, once in a while could even dig up a part or two, of course all of
this was in the wing destroyed so very likely gone..news video looked
rather impressive, in a sad sort of way...

in other words

BE CAREFUL WITH THEM GAS TANKS
