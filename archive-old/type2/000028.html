Come on guys I don't mind the occasional dumb question, but I have no time to 
ANSWER WORD GAME JUNK MAIL  or listen to debates on the spelling of Kharma, 
karma.  all else aside you have each others e-mail address when mail is sent 
and I see know logical reason to post this crap on the type two list.  KISS.  
Keep it simple stupid. The next step for me is to drop of the list.  Please 
refrain.
Peace Out
