&gt; What does this eliminate besides the points? Still need everything else?

haha.. I was going to ask that exact question!  This is NOT electronic 
ignition like it is being referred to in other emails; it is an 
electronic points replacement.  Electronic ignition actually adjusts the 
timing and dwell electronically (i.e. megasquirt).  With any of the four 
units mentioned, the distributor is still controlling the timing.

It doesn't look like the Crane unit does anything to change the timing 
except make it more stable, which is the exact same thing that the other 
products do.

So, essentially, you're paying twice as much, or more than 3 times as 
much as the product that the other listmember mentioned, all for a 
(supposedly) more reliable points replacement system?  With an external 
unit and more connections, it just looks like more points of failure.

If it allowed timing adjustments, then maybe it'd be worth it, but as a 
points replacement.. ehhhh..


&gt; My dizzy has a warped plate that makes points adjustment a nightmare. This
&gt; might be the ticket.

does the plate still move smoothly?  If not, the vacuum advance might 
not be working correctly, whether you have points or the points 
replacements..

regardless, I'd still get rid of the points ;)
