Subject: RE: Front Axle Beam Adjustment

&gt; &gt; now the bus sits 4 or 5 inches too high in the front. &gt; &gt; That is A LOT
TOOO HIGH! ......... sometimes the bushings,, or the shocks &gt; seize when the
beam is stored... take the shocks off and jump up and down on &gt; the front
bumper,, with the wheels on the ground.&gt; the suspesions should spring up and
down...&gt; grease the front end... put the shocks back on...
My old axle beam was replaced with a new beam I purchased from California.
Sure.  I can remove the front shock absorbers to see if the front end springs
freely. &gt; &gt;After looking at&gt; &gt; another bus of the same year I noticed that
axle beam sits lower. I'm not&gt; &gt; sure if the axle beam requires adjustment or
other suspension components at&gt; &gt; the front? Any suggestions?&gt; &gt; when you
say,,, sits lower... what do you mean..

the front axle beam on the other bus appeared to be adjusted differently.  In
other words the axle beam on my bus appears to be at a 90 degrees while the
other buses axle beam appeared to be at 45 degrees
