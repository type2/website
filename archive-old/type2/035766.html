Subject: PST Campout this weekend! (GA)

Last reminder...

Peach State Transporters will be holding it's 4th Annual Dead of
Winter Campout at Cloudland Canyon State Park in the NW Georgia
mountains February 4-6.  The park is off GA 136, 8 miles east of
Trenton and I-59, 18 miles NW of Lafayette.

Last year we had about twenty buses over the weekend, even though 
we had some nasty weather on Saturday night.

There are two different campgrounds, and they have cabins for those 
of you who don't like cold weather camping.  Campsites have water 
and electric hookups, so bringing space heaters is a good idea.  We 
will probably be on the campsites on the far side of the canyon, as 
they were newly renovated last year and were really nice.

There are great hiking trails down to the waterfalls as well as 
around the canyon rim.  So bring warm clothes, extra blankets, 
musical instruments, firewood, and come join us for a great winter 
campout.

So pack some warm clothes and I hope to see you there.
