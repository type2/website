Subject: RE: [T2] Side Mirror Seal/Gasket(formerly cargo door handle)

Seann,

This is one of those times when I actually use rtv on my bus.

Had one on a convertible that was the same way.  I found that
the valve cover gasket behind the mirror around the edges
would make it even with the chrome surface all around(yours may be 
different).

I glued the mirror to the cork and back all at the same time making sure 
that it stayed cetered in the back and even all around.

The next day I either used rtv or regular houshold &quot;lifetime&quot; silicone 
caulk in white.

Wasn't worried about it being a perfect application cause I just waited 
a coule of days for it to dry and then used a razor knife to cut the 
exceess off even with the surface of the mirror.

I doubt that anyone could tell how I had done it and unless they were
specifically examining my mirrors, no one would *ever* notice.

You might try www.mcmastercarr_dot_com

They have some of the most amazing things that you can not find anyplace 
else...including several kinds of those &quot;good&quot; hose clamps that we were 
discussing the other day.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Jon asked an excellant question regarding the repair of his side
&gt; view mirror.  The seal around the glass had failed and the mirror
&gt; itself had fallen out.
&gt; 
&gt; This exact thing has happened to me before..  I just bought some
&gt; silicone sealant and filled the edges and put the glass back into
&gt; the mirror unit proper.  This worked great until I found a
&gt; replacement mirror.  The trouble was that it look half-a**ed.  How
&gt; hard could it be to find a stinkin seal?  damned hard it turned out.
&gt; I couldn't find a replacement anywhere.  The mirror unit was
&gt; perfectly fine.  The glass was unbroken and serviceable.  Only the
&gt; seal was toast.  It looked just the picture that Jon provided in his
&gt; post:
&gt; http://members.cox_dot_net/jonwade/bus/glassgone.jpg
&gt; 
&gt; Long story short I still have the mirror and the unit because they
&gt; are the stock equipment and I have hope that someday I will be able
&gt; to find the correct &amp;*%$#_at_! seal for that mirror and return the part
&gt; to my beloved bus.
