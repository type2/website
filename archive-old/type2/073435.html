&gt;&gt;OK Mountain Folks,

&gt;&gt;Who has successfully put an altimeter in their bus, and become
&gt;&gt;pleased with what they bought?
&gt;&gt;If happy, what did you install?
&gt;&gt;Analog - Digital - Model ?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm looking to install one in Casper so I can see how high we go as
&gt;&gt;we go higher. :-)

&gt;I was thinking of getting GPS. You can altitude from them as well
&gt;locations, distance travelled and so on. Prices are getting real good
&gt;for the basic models.

I had an older airguide that worked well.  Used it for years in the bus
till one day it came unfastened from it's mount, fell onto the floor and
broke.  I bought a new airguide (finally found one at a huge RV store in
Phoenix) and it was a piece of crap.  Total waste of $40.

Then I picked up a Magellan GPS.  Took it up to BNNTA last year, and on a
couple other short trips.  It worked great as a compass, worked great as a
speedometer, but the altitude readings were pretty meaningless.  We would
start up a hill with it reading 976ft, gain a couple hundred feet of
altitude and it would read 974ft as we crested the hill.  It was almost as
if it were not calculating the altitude dynamically, but looking it up by
sector or something.  Maybe it would be okay for large changes in altitude,
I dunno... I was disappointed.  I sold the GPS to buy a nicer one but
haven't bought the nicer one yet.  The Magellan 300 that I had can be found
for under $100 - Frys was selling them for $59 one time.
