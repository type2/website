Subject: Re: Engine Size for a 71 bus..

&gt; I have a 71 bus with a 1600 cc engine,  1. what would be the Max
size I
&gt; could go...ie cc 2 or would I or could I just modify the existing
1600cc
&gt; with stock parts?

IMHO, you will get maximum enjoyment from your bus by keeping it
stock.  Here's why:

The 1600DP engine was originally designed with a displacement of
1200cc and about 40 hp.  Thus, it has already been punched out to 1/3
more displacement and half-again as much power as its original design
allowed.  If it was capable of being bigger with reliability, VW would
have done that instead of investing big bucks to design the typ 4
engine.

While it is true that you can get some remarkable power from a typ 1
engine, it will come at the expense of reliability, unless you are
willing to put some _major_ money into the engine.  We're talking
thousands of dollars here!

The limiting factor in typ 1 engine power is cooling.  The more power
you produce, the more heat will be produced.  While you can keep the
bottom end cool with external coolers, the top end relies on its
finning and the cooling fan for cooling.  The heads aren't modified
for additional cooling in big-bore engines, so the heads will run
hotter when the extra power is being produced.  

Bug drivers can get away with this, since they only use the extra
power in bursts, for acceleration.  The thermal mass of the heads is
adequate to store the excess heat to be disappated later on.  Bus
drivers usually want the extra power for hill-climbing, though, and
continuous use of the extra power will overheat the top end, severely
affecting engine life.

It's much better to have a bus that gets you there every time than to
have a bus that will get you there 5 minutes quicker, but only 9 times
out of 10!

If you really want a faster bus, then the best route is to get a later
model with a typ 4 engine.  This way you will get speed and reliability!
