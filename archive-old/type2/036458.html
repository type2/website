Subject: Re: 78 Exhaust Question

&gt;There seems to be something peculiar to the 78.  What is it?  Ron has
&gt;&quot;Complete Exhaust System (75-78 Bus)  79.95 AC251673&quot;, but all the other
&gt;kits, e.g. EMPI do not include the 78 model year.  Should I be aware of
&gt;something before I go buying a system?  Also, after checking the archives I
&gt;noted that there's a fair deal of disgruntled EMPI owners in VW-land.  If
&gt;this is the case, what's the preferred option?  (Bread is a concern).

The other people are fools 75-78 is all the same, unless it is a CA bus and
even then I thought the change was '79 for the O2 sensor.

Buy a good 1 piece replacement muffler and 2 new heater boxes, but beware
the flanges on the U tubes leading to the boxes may also be in bad shape,
as might be the header pipes, and those are both irreplaceable (though
fixable with a mig and a lathe and a bandsaw).

In fact as the '72-'74 system doesn't have those parts, I'd be inclined if
I were
buying all new to buy the early boxes and muffler where the boxes attach
directly to the head.  This means you got to get the header pipes off and the
new boxes on without being an idiot and messing up an exhaust stud but it
gives you all new stuff all the way in like new shape.  To do it you would
have
to snag the front heater pipes coming off the boxes and the under cylinder
tins off a '72 to '74 as well out of a yard.  Maybe something else I'm
forgetting.

Anyway it is a thought either way, if the U shaped tubes look nice (the
flanges
the heat box bolts to, not so much the tubes) just go with the '78 stuff,
if the
flanges are rusted away so far it looks like they won't seal, they probably
won't,
and a retrovert may be in order.  Another nice thing about the early system is
you can use a nice heavy duty OEM muffler instead of an POS as even the
better quality 1 pieces aren't up to the OEM standards.  But they do cost
more.
This is going to be $600+ anyway round.
