Subject: [T2] side mirrors


&gt;yesterday, i was adjusting my passenger mirror and the mirror came right
&gt;off of the arm.
&gt;
&gt;YES.  I got some el cheapo pot metal replacement that broke right off at
the screw.  The mirror looks great but won't stick in.  I guess I learned my
lesson that shiny chrome does not equal good quality!
