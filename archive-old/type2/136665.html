Subject: Brakes bleeding revisited

Well, I finished the brake job!  It's a very nice
improvement.  My drum brakes actually make my
front end dive when I firmly apply the brakes
even at lower speeds (25-30mph).  This wasn't the
case before.  

All who responded to my previous post and stated
I needed to adjust my brakes again were correct. 
I needed to get the new shoes much closer to the
freshly turned drums. (I had been adjusting them
like a Chevy, as one guy put it.)  Readjusting
the brakes helped and got me back on the road
with basically 3 brakes, or maybe just 2.5.  This
was about what I had before the job and I didn't
know any better.  It is my first drum brake bus,
and I had not done any work on the brakes since I
bought the beast. 

That being said, I've probably driven my previous
three busses (a 71, 76 and 74 with disk front
brakes) without rear brakes.  My emergency brake
comes on in just a few inches now, rather than me
pulling the thing almost fully to the rear.  

Any way, for the other bus pilots who aren't
mechanically savvy enough, spend some time
reading the brake adjusting topics in the T2
library (and Dolan's posts).  I'll be adjusting
my brakes fairly often now, as in at least every
few thousand miles.  I'm told I should do it
every week or two until the new shoes and drums
get used to one another.  

For the others who said I needed brake hoses, you
were right also.  The right rear was obvious. 
Almost no fluid trickled out as I bled it.  The
right front also had less pressure than the two
left drums.  The hoses looked good from the
outside, yet were collapsed or collapsing on the
inside.  Take this to heart if you haven't
changed the hoses recently.  

Also take note that my mechanic buddy who was
assisting me for beer said I needed slave
cylinders and the hoses were ok.  In his
experience, brake hoses don't fail and slave cyls
seize up.  This maybe true in the Ford/Chevy
would.  In any event, you cannot rely on the
mechanics.  Without the list, I'd probably still
have 2.5 brakes.  

Anyway, I'm really happy with the results.  I was
considering upgrading to front disks and maybe
vanagon self adjusting rears, and this was part
of the reason I waited a little too long on the
new shoes, but the fully functioning stock 70
system isn't too shabby.  Since their aren't many
mountain passes in my future, the upgrades are
definitely on the back shelf.  

Thanks again for Ronnie at the Old Volks Home,
Type2parts_dot_com, for getting me the hoses at a
great price (about 1/3 what BAP wanted) and
getting them on my doorstep in two days! 

One other thought: is there a trick to
visualizing the brake shoes?  I can see the cyls
no problem, but I cannot see the linings of the
shoes.  Maybe I have to back them off to see
them?    Any guesses as to how long the shoes
should last on a a well-adjusted and properly
functioning system?    Should I be expecting new
shoes in 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 or what?
