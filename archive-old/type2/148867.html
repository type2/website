It's a wax motor thermostat used on the Mexi-beetles that the vendors  
are selling because the Wahler bellows are NLA.

&gt; Skeptical, I
&gt; measured it at room temperature and then placed it in
&gt; hot water but I noticed no expansion. Has anyone else
&gt; had any experience with one of these?

Might be best to keep the flaps open all the time instead of trying  
to adapt it.
