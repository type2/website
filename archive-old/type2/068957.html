&gt;Instead of replacing the joints per Bentley, I thought about other

&gt; [Replace the boot: too tough to be worth it]
&gt; [Self vulcanizing rubber tape: appears OK after 6 months]

Another option done around here is to tap a grease nipple into the ball
joint to allow grease that's dried up or is leaking out to be topped up or
replaced.  I think it should be possible to do this on a bus.  I did this
recently on my Hy*ndai P*ny [sorry, sorry...] recently, and while the
problem causing the leaking grease (a small hole in a boot) is still there,
it bought me some time before I have to replace the joints, which is a job
I'd like to put off for as long as possible.

If I can keep good clean grease in the joints, I expect to get several more
years of use out of my existing joints.  And that's good enough for my
&quot;daily&quot; winter driver.

(I did only the lower joints BTW, but it's usually the lowers that wear the
fastest anyway.)
