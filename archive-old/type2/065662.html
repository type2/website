Subject: Re: &quot;Hammering&quot; sound in 81

I  am having a problem on my new'82 and believe it's the motor mounts. The oil fill tube runs 
just above the the engine support that the 4 motor mounts attach to. The clearance between tube 
and the support is minimal and I suspect that the engine has settled. Anyone know howmuch 
clearance there should be? Is it really necessary to drop the engine?  Any suggestions would be 
appreciated.

I had almost exactly the same thing with my Vanagon &amp; it turned
out to be the motor mounts.  The rubber had so decayed that
under certain conditions (turns, etc.) it would make an awful
hammering sound.  Then it would go away, sometimes for
days, then reappear, often on the same curve
  4 new motor mounts (and a dropped
engine &amp; a lot of time &amp; sweat) and all was quiet again.

&gt;Acouple of weeks ago while I was returning from the store with my son when we
&gt;suddenly heard a loud hammering sound that lasted for about 2 seconds and
&gt;then quit. At the time I was doing about 25 up hill and in a hard right
&gt;curve. It was definitely a mechanical sound of the sinking heart variety but
&gt;I wasn't even sure that it was us since there was no effect on the vehicle.
&gt;The thumping was less than 10 per second, in other words less than what I
&gt;would expect of a reving engine. With no repetition, I forgot about it or at
&gt;least wished it away.
&gt;
&gt;Now this weekend I take a 150 mile jaunt to the mountains and virtually the
&gt;same thing happens and under about the same circumstances; up hill and in a
&gt;right turn doing about 25 for about a second and then pause and then another
&gt;second. Didn't experience it again for the balance of the trip or the return.
&gt;What was different this time was that I had the windows up so it wasn't
&gt;nearly as loud and I had the impression that it was coming from the front end
&gt;of the van rather than the engine. Again no effect felt, just noise. 
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas? Responses a long the line of &quot;Oh yeah, that's normal&quot; would be
&gt;preferred.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
