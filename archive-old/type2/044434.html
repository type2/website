&gt; Would you mind sharing any of those links with a fellow bus owner who also has
&gt; co-workers thinking she's crazy?  Thanks!  Enjoy your weekend!&gt;

You got it!  I got about a dozen replies, all of which were of the same two
websites. They are:

 http://www.vintagebus_dot_com
 http://thesamba_dot_com/vw

Additionally, Isaiah sent me the Url to his webpage, where his restoration
project is coming along beautifully!  It is:

 http://www.luckyboys_dot_com/isaiah/62.htm

The top two have a ton of good pics, but Isaiah's site has the irrefutable
charm of a proud VW owner who really loves his bus!

Thanks again, everyone!
