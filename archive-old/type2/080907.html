Subject: Boneyard Riviera-Save This Bus! Jessup, MD

Hey Folks,
    While driving down Route 1 yesterday from Baltimore to Washington DC =
I spotted a late 70's Bay which I believe to be a Riviera, it certainly =
wasn't a Westy. The place is called &quot;Crazy Rays, and it is right on =
route 1 in Jessup, MD. I stopped, and asked if it was available for =
parts, and was told no, it runs and was for sale whole. When I asked if =
I could take a closer look at it the said &quot;I don't know&quot; and disappeared =
into the back. I didn't have time to wait, so I went out and walked by =
it, has the usual cancer in the rockers and dog legs, but not the worst =
I've ever seen. The interior looked &quot;OK&quot; from what I could see, which =
wasn't much. If it really does run, and the front beam isn't bad, easily =
worth a grand-BUT, I have no idea what they want for it. Also, be =
forewarned these did mot appear to be the friendliest nor the brightest =
folks. It may be worth a look. I wish I had room for it!     Jeff
