Subject: Buzzing dimmer relay

Doing a little wiring work on my 69 to get it ready for inspection and just to 
get everything hooked back up the right way and when I hooked the BRN/WHT wire 
from the turn signal switch to pin S on the dimmer relay (using the 69-70 
diagram from VB) and turned my E flasher switch on, the dimmer relay started 
making this horrible buzzing noise. Is this kosher or is my attempt at fixing 
my wiring hit a snag.

This is some kind of wierd hybrid bus. 10 panel fuse box with all the wiring 
for the 12 panel fuse box and switches too.
