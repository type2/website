&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I have remembered that part of bus driving.  Hence my desire to move
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the spare to the front of the bus.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I don't think VW had that add-on in mind when they did their crash testing
&gt; &gt; What crash testing, we are talking the semi dark ages here.

&gt; It was thought of, though.  the steering wheel mount of the baywindow is
&gt; designed to collapse in a frontal impact.  The bumper mounts were designed
&gt; to slide to take minor bumps (provided the bumper is repositioned after

yes and the older bumper may be tougher than the newer ones 

&gt; &gt; then there are the exceptions, couple years ago a tractor trailer driver
&gt; &gt; fell asleep at the wheel on I-81 near Scranton, he drifted sideways
&gt; 
&gt; Every rule has exceptions.  My father would not be with us today if
&gt; seat belts were required in the '60s, as he lost a drag link and had the

&gt; belts?  Nope, because I realize that there are 100 ways to die by not
&gt; wearing seat belts versus 1 way to die by wearing seat belts.

for sure, I always wear my seat belts and during the little incident with
the tractor trailer the seatbelt held me tightly in the seat and I know I
was able to crank it lock to lock twice before finally not getting it back
in time and sliding off the road.
  it's amazing how fast you can turn that big old steering wheel with a
little adrenilin flowing.

my tire is on the front because I like the way the bus looks with it up
there...just a personal preference, no logic involved
