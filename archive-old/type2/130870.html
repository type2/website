Subject: having prob's with my valve covers

hi all,
i climbed under the rusty bus to do a valve adjustment and install some new 
gaskets and the bail on the pass side wont lower all the way... its hitting 
the cross bar behind the engine. the driver side is fine.

so, i took the bail off first and then removed the cover, then wrestled with 
it to get it back on that way. the only thing i can think of is the motor 
mount is giving way. the bus has never been hit in the back.

any ideas? thanks,
Bob Margiotti
