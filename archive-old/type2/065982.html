Subject: Re: Master cylinder off, brake line advice?

&gt;I want to (must) replace a brake line, the short one to the front driver
&gt;side.  I don't
&gt;expect a prefitted part to be available (but is it?), so I assume the next
&gt;step is
&gt;getting some special tool for flanging the threaded thing onto the pipe.

Thoses hoses are at FLAPS, all tooled up and ready to go on. Splits + 68
use one size, 70-on uses another (I believe that's right). They don't even
cost very much, I think my last one was about $8.50.

The tool you want for brake lines is one of those wrenches that looks like
a box wrench with a slot cut in it. It lets you grip most of the points
while the cut-out part slides past the brake line. Don't ever use an open
end wrench on those, you'll round them off (you already found this out,
right?) ;)
