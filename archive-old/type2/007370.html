&gt;List,
&gt;Idiot question:
&gt;I bought a 78 parts camper with all the bells and whistles including 
factory AC (no engine or tranny).  There are two radiator looking 
devices mounted under the bus - one is for the fridge, i know.  Is the 
other for an oil cooler?  If not, what's it for?  Many thanx.

Actually both are for the A/C.  I don't know what they are called, but 
that's what they are for.  Never been much for knowing my A/C 
terminology :-)
