Yes,it's Friday!! I can finally post the question I've been wanting to post all week.Now it's Friday and I can do it.OK, I notice that VW type 2 owners are more likely than other car owners to name their cars. Maybe it has to do with that hippie-VW connection and the idea that everything has feelings.Sure, I feel that way about my camper, but no one seems to be able to explain it. So I want to do a survey of how many of us name our type 2's,what the most common names are, and why you name them. I would love to be one of you who ones a bright orange one so I could name it Pumpkin Loaf. But mine's not orange, so it's Butterfly instead.I'll let everyone know the results next Friday. Also, has anyone ever seen that episode of the &quot;Wonder Years&quot; when Karen gets married and her and her husband buy a vw camper? I love that episode. Does anyone know what year that was? I'm guessing a '69 or '70.Thanks!
 Alexis- MA '70 camper (Butterfly)
