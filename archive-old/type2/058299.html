Subject: Replacing battery cables

Okay, so now, with some help, I got the obscenely-corroded connectors off
of the old dead battery and put a new battery in its place.  However, the
connectors are rusted and battered, and both of their tightening bolts
disintegrated during cleaning, so there isn't a connection that my '71 bus
can get any juice out of.

How hard is it to replace just the connector ends?  Is it like putting a
new plug on a 110v power cord -- chop the wire, expose some ends, slip
them into the plug, screw it down?

How hard is it to pull the cables out and replace them?  My books (Muir
and Clymer) don't talk about this at all.  I have limited tools and
limited knowledge.  If your response has the phrase &quot;Take the engine out&quot;
anywhere in it, forget it. :)  If it can't be done with a screwdriver and
a socket set... well, tell me how to do it anyway, just so I'll know.
