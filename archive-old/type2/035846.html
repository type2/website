Happy Sunday!

Yesterday Jed Thompson and I rendezvoued in Wildwood to pass the 'cap ..
lunched at Hardee's, chatted about the list, our respective busses and
generally got acquainted.  Jed's got a nice 80 Vanagon with a progressive Weber
setup; I told him I wish my bus had a top hatch as wide as his for better
accessibility.  At about 12:30 PM we shook hands and headed back via US 301 in
opposite directions.  On the way back I stopped at Silver River State Park,
which used to be part of Silver Springs until the state bought and preserved it
(thanks, Gov. Chiles), and hiked down to the river to take some photos.  I'll
get the handoff and state park pics up on my website ASAP.

Last night the hubcap and I had a short one-sided conversation about its
psychic influence on the karma of the busses that it will be riding in
(including mine), then under a cloudless night sky, I held it aloft and said,
&quot;Behold, the only thing greater than yourself!&quot;  (with apologies to Alex Haley)
 Did that help with the mojo issue?  Time will tell ..
