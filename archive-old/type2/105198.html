Subject: Re: 65 mph expectations and head question (loss of power)

Hmm.. I suppose my experience covers both ends of the 1600 spectrum:

I drive a '71 with a new (~1000 mi.) 1600DP meximotor and a properly timed
009.  It's perfectly happy cruising at 60 on the freeway with a fair bit
of power to spare.  I've decided that 55-60 is fine, even in a 70 zone,
and 65 is my &quot;never exceed&quot; speed -- the plan is to give this engine a
long and happy life in the slow lane -- but it would maintain at least
70-75 at full throttle if asked.

The runout engine that the meximotor replaced could achieve 0-60 in around
2-3 minutes.  On level ground it would maintain 60 only at full throttle,
and 55 at pretty-close-to-full throttle.  That was a stock 1600 DP that,
according to the PO, had gone about 80,000 miles since its last overhaul.

I'm still a novice, so I can't speak to the question about differences
between rebuilt heads.  I just don't know enough.  I have a friend who
also owns a 71, and his engine got toasted by an ex-girlfriend who didn't
understand the urgency of the generator light.  He says that it still
turns over, but it doesn't start or run.  I expect that when we get around
to tearing his engine apart, we'll find that it at least needs heads, and
my inclination will be to order brand-new heads ($130/ea.) rather than
buying rebuilt at all.  Especially given what I've heard about original
dual-port T1 heads being prone to cracking -- it seems like practically
every engine rebuilder excludes this from their warranty -- I think I'd
prefer new Mexican over rebuilt German.  Anyone else have an opinion about
this?  (blasphemy?)

Thanks,

- Miles
