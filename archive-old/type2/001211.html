X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

In reference to distributors, my experience has been that they all will
work, some better some not so well.  Anytime you tune up your engine, you
should also tune up your distributor.  This is the most often overlooked
part of the engine.  The advance mechanism is in need of cleaning and
lubricating as well as the cam itself.  The bushings should be checked for
wear as this will cause dwell variations if you are still using a
point/condenser ignition.  Anyone still using points should consider an
electronic drop in or even a later ignition from an '80 to '84 vanagon.  The
merits of an electronic ignition over a point ignition are so over whelming,
there is no reason to even elaborate on them.  EVERY and I mean EVERY
distributor should be checked periodically for advance curve performance.  A
new distributor must always be checked.  I have found no two distributors to
ever be exactly the same even when they were the same numbers.  009's  are
notorious for being just a random batch of advance curves.  If a syncrograph
in not available, you can install a degreed pulley or degree your existing
one in some manner so that you can view the curve with a timing light and a
tachometer.  I set me total advance at 30 degrees at 3000 rpm and let it
idle where it wants to.  Initial advance is only a place to start the engine
initially until you have had a chance to verify the advance curve to see if
it is in spec for your particular engine application.  Stock engines should
stay within stock specs and modified engines will have curves that are
derived on a dyno or by the cut and try method of empirical testing.  A
stock engine will benefit from a vacuum advance at light throttle and lower
rpm while the centrifugal only distributor will rob you of mileage and
increase oil consumption and cylinder wear at the same throttle position and
rpm.  If you run consistently at or above 3000 rpm all the time, there won't
be much difference between a vacuum advance and centrifugal only
distributor.  The 050 was originally used in 356 Porsches and was valued as
a &quot;Hot Rod&quot; distributor for VW's.  Well they really didn't work all that
well in a VW because they weren't engineered to do so.  They might have
improved the ego of the owner, but really did little to improve the
performance of the engine with out a lot of other modifications.  Remember,
the factory knows best for the all around performance of your engine.
Modified engines are in a league of their own so I won't elaborate on them
here.  Those are my thoughts and experiences, and I have had more than a few
of them over the last 35 years.

Subject: [T2] Distributor 009 or 050


&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; What is/are the advantage(s) if any  of using a 050 distributor versus an
&gt; 009 distributor on a type IV engine? I see by the archives (thanks) that
&gt; there are many a 009 in the type IVs. I just purchased an 050 and am
&gt; wondering why I did, except that the vendors recommend that I do! (No
vacuum
&gt; advance distributors, not until I can afford a stock vacuum pulse!)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
