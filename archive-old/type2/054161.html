Subject: spare tire cover

Gentlepersons-
                       I've decided to chamge the cover on my front mounted 
spare tire on my
bay. For obvious reasons, I've been intrigued by one I've seen on other vans 
(not VW's),
and I've looked through a few RV sites but to no avail...Does anyone out 
there in ether-
land know a source for a &quot;Roman Wheels&quot; spare cover, or even just the logo.
Thanks in advance.
Tony Roman(see what I mean?) in NJ
