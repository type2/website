Listers,
I am looking at a '68 single cab that is in good shape but does need some
body parts.  Does anyone know of a source for pickup body parts?  To be
more specific:
The truck was rolled over and needs: both rear corners, a new cab roof,
both cab doors all of the cab glass.  I know that most, if not all, of the
mechanicals from a transporter of the same year will work on this truck,
but I'm not sure about the windshield, doors, etc...
Basically, I need to find the single cab guru and a source for body parts
