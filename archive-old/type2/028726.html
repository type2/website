&gt;How can I contact &quot;AVP&quot;?
&gt;
&gt;Steve

Steve,

They have a website with contact info at http://216.74.88.88/.

Their toll-free number is 1-800-548-5766; other info:

erin_at_avp-worldwide_dot_com

Surface Mail:
AVP-WORLDWIDE
P.O. BOX 426
RIO LINDA, CA 95673-2437

Drop by:
6529 32nd Street
North Highlands,Ca

Please note; they sell engines, heads, and such; not parts in general. I'm
not sure if they'd sell a single cam outright or not, even though they do
have crankshafts listed. BTW, when I said &quot;for the price it was worth the
trade-offs,&quot; in my earlier post, I was referring to the price of the engine.

Thanks!

Joe
