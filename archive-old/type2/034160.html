&gt;Gary, what you are describing is a sort of electric supercharger. Yes it
&gt;would work, but I can't imagine how you'd get enough power to drive it, to
&gt;have any effect. I think you'd be better driving the fan straight off the
&gt;engine, which is what a supercharger is.

Having had some email on this I thought I'd add a bit more. To supercharge
an engine you've got to force more air in than would nomally be taken in by
the suction of the engine so it's going to need a big fan.

Lets say your engine is a 1600 cc and it turns over at 3000 rpm, Every rev
draws in 800 cc of air and so you need to provide 4800 litres of air/min,
and if you want to boost it its going to be more like 5000 litres. Thats 5
cubic metres. Sure needs to be a hefty fan, and needs to be variable with
engine speed.

Could be done no doubt, if you could get electric power to drive it - tough
with a normal battery set up,  but I imagine anything like a heater fan
would just get in the way.
