In case anyone wants to know, these panels are illustrated at
http://www.ahschofield.co_dot_uk/page6.htm
The outer panels are welded on, the centre one is bolted.  I have them on my
bus, which is neither early nor a sunroof model (but does have a cutout for
the poptop).  Just thought I'd throw that one in.
