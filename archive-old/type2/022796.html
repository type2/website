	I can't be the only musician on the list---these ARE VW buses we're 
talking about., after all.  I play the guitar in a bar band called the 
Surftones, plus an original instrumental outfit called the Reventlos (imagine 
the Ventures on steroids and psychedelics).  Our 2nd CD will be released next 
month (shameless plug).
	Which reminds me of my favorite musician joke:  What's the difference 
between a guitar player and a savings bond?  A savings bond will eventually 
mature and earn money.
