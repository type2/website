&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Looking at 185's vs. 195's on Tires for my 71
&gt; &gt; &gt; Westy (1600cc).......Got the
&gt; &gt; &gt; right tire it's just a matter of what width..
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; well for a little more stability and better (IMO) handling you could 
&gt; &gt; 205/70R14 tires...they are almost identical in outside diameter to 
&gt; &gt; stock 185/14 tires that are stock.
&gt; 
&gt; One other thing to think about is that early bays have the worm-and-
&gt; peg steering box that is weaker than the later worm-and-roller box.  

but Bentley says  that the worm and peg is bigger and stronger than the
previous units starting in 1968  

&gt; Unfortunately, the two boxes do not interchange.  My theory is that 
&gt; the increased steering effort of the radial tires over the original 
&gt; narrow bias ply tires caused more steering box failures, prompting the 
&gt; change.  For this reason, I've resisted the urge to go to wider tires 
&gt; on my '71.  If you do make the switch, make sure you are moving before 
&gt; steering to reduce stress on the peg.

I have not noticed significant differences between the 185 and 205 tires,
but it has been a long time since I used the narrow tires
