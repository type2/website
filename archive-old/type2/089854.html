Subject: Re: [T2] 15w40

Take this with a grain of salt, but here is what I have found from a
reliable source, who works on nothing but air cooled Koehler, Wisconsin,
and Briggs, and Straton, engines--and big horse power stuff too---

He attends seminars, offered by these various manufacturers all the time
to keep up to date on engine data.

Now, he has told me flat out as I collect JD garden tractors, that every
mfg. has instructed the engine rebuilder's time in and time out, that a
multi viscosity oil is absolutely not made for an air cooled engine, and
nine times out of ten, and engine failure can be attributed to using
multi viscosity oils.

The reason is they just can't hold their viscosity under load, with the
operating temperatures that an air cooled engine develops--

Now OK--a VW Type 2 isn't a lawn mower engine,but they most certainly
develop mucho heat, just as an air cooled VW engine does, if not more
under extreme driving conditions in the heat of the summer months---

With this information in mind, I'm changing my thoughts about multi
viscosity oil--which up until a few years ago wasn't in my
vocabulary--until I forgot to lighten up my oil weight in my 67
Bonneville 428, at -20 below----the 40 weight must have been like
glue,as I had to heat up the oil pan for 3 hours with a charcoal fire to
get it running---

My error, not the oils---or the vehicles--

I have found that one of my tractors that I use often a  JD 140, which
has a 14 horse Koehler, which I was using 15-40 gobbled that oil up
cutting a 2 acre lot---I switched to straight 50 weight at 85--90
degree's here, and the consumption is just about zip---

My 3 cents---

Later,

Terry

I was going to stay away, far away, from this thread but......
Go here and read the section on 'viscosity index improvers' and then
remember
all the posts that ask &quot; is 230 to 250 too hot??&quot;
http://www.vtr_dot_org/maintain/lubricants-redline.html
Think it is all BS? Here is another site with info on it, but not as
informative as the 1st one: 
http://www.eskimo_dot_com/~dalus/bmw/all/misc/all_oilfaq.html Multi-grade
dino oil has not changed over the years. Only the additive packages.
That is the only difference and so-called improvement. I have repeatedly
written to Castrol and asked them how they got past the 210 degree
polymer breakdown and how they substantiated their advertising slogan
&quot;Engineered for greater protection against thermal breakdown&quot; on every
bottle of oil. That has been going on for over 5 years now. They refuse
to answer any questions!! BUT they have changed the BS slogan on the
front now. They now say: &quot;Engineered For Greater Protection Against
Breakdown&quot;. Hmmm, I wonder why they stopped using the word &quot;Thermal&quot;???
But, alas, it still includes 'thermal' on the back. 
But just like tires, you guys are gonna use whatever you want.

I hope there is no danger starting up the oil thread. 
Richard, it's a holy war, I tell you... Louis vs. Sulimein all over
again!
Crusade vs. jihad! :-) 
The Bentley shows similar temperature ranges for 20w50 and 15w40. What's
the advantage of using 20w50? 
The numbers on a can of oil read as follows: the first number, usually
followed by a W is the viscosity at room temp (70 degrees fahrenheit)
the W means &quot;winter&quot; and says it will still pour at freezing temps. The
third number is the viscosity at ~250 degrees fahrenheit. If there is no
third number, then the first number is also the viscosity at 250. 
Thus a 20W-50 oil protects like a 20 weight oil at room temperature and
like a 50 weight oil at 250 degrees, a 15W-40 oil protects like a 15
weight oil at room temperature and like a 40 weight oil at 250 degrees.
An sae30W oil protects like 30 weight at room temperature and like a 30
weight oil at 250 degrees. An sae30 oil does the same, but may not pour
at freezing temps. I believe it is *possible* to find an SAE30 oil but
it is a challenge :-) 
Also, I asked someone about a single grade oil like 30 and 40 but they
said it has a hard time circulating. 
IMHO, this is pure bull. 
What's good for our TypeIV engines? 
Well, yes... err... I dunno :-) My religious belief is that I used to
run 20W-50 year round. We had an oil thread last fall, tho that changed
my mind. Karl, who I respect greatly, opined that at 250, the multigrade
oils may protect like the second number for a bit, but that the
multi-vis additives broke down quickly and you were left with straight
weight oil of the loser viscosity index. This did match my experience,
so this spring I changed to straight weight SAE50W and in the fall I
will change it to SAE30W. This is new to me, but so far it is working
out. We are just starting into the 90/90 (90 degrees, 90% humidity) days
here, so the experiment is still running.
