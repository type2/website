&gt;
&gt; For those wondering, Steve Sandlin's website has been down for a  
&gt; few months since the ISP shut down:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.steveslockshop_dot_com/
&gt;
&gt; I heard from Steve recently and he says the website will be going  
&gt; back up and he'll be cutting VW keys again soon.

Try giving him a call:

(936) 435-1324
