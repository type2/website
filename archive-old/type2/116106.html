&gt; TIA for any ideas...

I have a fuel pump harness pulled from a bus. This makes bench starting the
FI motor simple. The rest of the harness should be on the motor if it was
pulled, all you need do is get a double relay hooked up, fuel supply and
return, power and that's it.

If you don't have the pump harness you could gerry-rig one. And I think your
idea may work, but there is too much figuring it in for me, easier to get a
double relay and the pump harness...
