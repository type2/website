----- Original Message ----- 

&gt; &gt; but their customer service
&gt; &gt; quoted me $30+ dollars shipping on the part which only
&gt; &gt; cost $27, so obviously NOT an option in this
&gt; &gt; situation.
&gt;
&gt; Why? The shipping cost will more than likely be the same anywhere.
&gt; Plus BD will get it out to you quick if you ask for it.

Agreed, $30 sounds about right. The cost of the part you are ordering
shouldn't dictate what the shipping cost should be.  You're talking about
shipping a rocker panel here, not something that will fit in a small box.
