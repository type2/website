Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny bushings, linkages, adjustments?

Has anyone ever drilled, tapped and installed grease fitting(s) in the tube?
If so, did it seem to help?

&gt; Billy,
&gt;
&gt; Whooo! What an opening&lt;grin&gt;.
&gt;
&gt; I have no idea how long or short.  Since I suspect that it is just a
&gt; locator &quot;device&quot; I suspect that it might not matter.
&gt;
&gt; But!, I am still not happy with my shift linkage and am wondering how to
&gt; grease those 3 plastic &quot;carriers&quot; in the tube.....any hints from anyone on
&gt; this????
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Okay, so this tunnel is obviously why the rear shift rod cannot be
pulled so easily as the front. It all makes sense now.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Didn't you (Karl?) mention modifying the new bushings to fit typical to
the older ones? My shifting has been terrible.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; One more question, please. The ball on the bottom of the shifter has a
little
&gt; protrusion apparently to line it up/maintain alignment in the cup of the
front shift rod that it falls into.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My protrusion seems too short.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Did I just say that?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How long should the protrusion be?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Go easy on me.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;The rear rod goes thru a &quot;tunnel&quot;(a pipe).  The 2 bellows are on each
end of the pipe and seal the tunnel from the elements while the rod goes in
at the front and out in the rear.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;This tunnel/pipe is what the bushings ride inside of to help keep the
rod centered in the tunnel.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Front and rear couple together in the front and then the rear goes
&gt; &gt; &gt;straight thru to the rear tranny coupler.
