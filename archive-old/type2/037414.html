Subject: 73 bus for sale in NJ

Dear friends,

    I have a 73 BUS that was converted into a camper.  It has the following 
camper equipment; Bed/Bench, sink/icebox, upper cabinet, side cabinet, 
jalousie windows, and jumpseat.  The sink/ice box and jalousie windows are 
not currently installed.  The under belly is very clean (not much rust).  
The poptop works but could use a new canvas soon.  I have the child cot up 
top.  The body needs a complete paint job and some tlc.  This Vehicle is 
currently a daily driver but will not be sold with Engine. So an Engine is 
all it would need. Trans is included (manual) and is in good shape.  I would 
keep it myself but I am buying a 75 and can't afford to keep two buses.  
Okay now for the asking price.  I need $700 for it. I am located in Southern 
NJ.  And can be reached VIA e-mail at kuday1_at_hotmail_dot_com.  This bus is a 
very good canidate for restoration or just plain old cruising.  I figured 
first the list then the world.  Peace brothers.

Yucel Kuday
