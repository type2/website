Just for kicks. Double check the spark wires. to make sure they are
still attached in the correct order. #4 should be next to the correct
#1 wire &amp; #2 should be on the other side of the #1 wire when
confirmed.

&gt; I rechecked vavle clearance, (fine)
&gt; someone told me maybe my O ring washer on the intake
&gt; is smashed and maybe blocking it somewhat, is this
&gt; possible?

I doubt it would block the airflow enough to do any restriction of
merrit, however if it is not sealed correctly you will have a huge
vacuum leak which will cause the engine to run HOT. If worried about
this do check it.
 
&gt; I just want my bus to run like a VW should and Im
&gt; getting more frustrated!!!
&gt; of course I cant complain, i practically stole the
&gt; thing.

don't get too frustrated. if some more simple things like making sure
wires etc are in order doen't work, I'd recommend an engine pull. that
way you can confirm a lot of stuff.

&gt; b.t.w. this is the bus that sat for 7-8 yrs, and PO
&gt; said it had over heated, etc, etc. 
&gt; What is the likely culprit??

well, if it overheaded &amp; dropped a valve or worse cracked a head, you
won't ever get it fixed w/out doing major work. but easily done if you
have the patience.

&gt; should i again drop the motor and check for the intake
&gt; senario, is this a far fetched..??

if worried about the intake do check it, you don't want a vacuum leak
that big running that head so lean it cooks it.
