Subject: Exhaust leaks
Date: Thu, 14 Jun 2001 20:03:39 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I had the exhaust manifolds ('75 to '78 style) off for sandblasting and
paint.  Put them back and now they leak.  I had a hard time getting the oval
copper seals to stay in the right place as I put the manifolds back in the
heads.  I think they did not seat correctly.

So two questions for you all:

First, should I get new copper seals or can I use the old ones?

Second, how do I get them to seat correctly?  Engine is in the bus, and I am
installing Michaelangelo style.  Can I glue them to the tops of the manifold
flanges?

Regards,

Grant
