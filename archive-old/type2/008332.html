To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hey, I have a little rust here and there on my bus.
I was wondering if there is anything I can put on it
to keep it from getting worse. Someone once recommended
Corroless Rust Stabilizer. However, it looks like that 
after I apply it..I will have to paint the spots I put the Corroless
on. I'd prefer to find something clear that would do the same thing.
Is there anything available or is Corolless the best thing I could use. 
Thanks to all who replyed to my oil leak post. I feel
much better now. Thanks again.
