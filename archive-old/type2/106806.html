Subject: WAS  RE: no brake NOW Is there a Diagram?

&gt; As I said before my bus seems to be a mix of the 68-69 and 69-70 diagram. I
&gt; have the ten fuse fuse box but the 4 pin e flasher. The wires on the small

Does anyone know if there is a 68 or 69 wiring diagram with 10 fuses and
no 9pin flasher box?
This would be correct for pretty much every 68/69 ive had or seen

68s Ive had/seen have no 9pin and 69s have no 12 fuses.
