&gt; I don't think that they will go that far.  The importer only has seven, or
&gt; twelve, or fifteen employees depending upon which source you believe.

   Not to mention that the Chinese company used the &quot;FTS&quot; in the identi-
fication numbers of tires that FTS may or may not have brokered...
   I hate to say it, but this is &quot;globalization' perhaps not at its worst,
but
up there...
   FTS will probably disappear...The Chinese factory will sell tires thru'
an-
other broker with new names and just maybe they'll add the adhesive strips
(at least for a while) and the consumers will either replace their own tires
or
wait for the next blowout... ;-(
