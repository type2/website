Subject: table

Hi again guys and gals.  I went to my local Hancock Fabrics and  they have the snaps for the curtains in stock.  The 78 manual that  Karl turned me onto shows two snaps on the table.  I have one on  the back side but the picture on page six shows one on the top surface  of the leaf (folded back) and a tie back by the seat.  My 76  doesn't have the tie by the seat and no evidence that it ever had a  snap on the leaf.  I know this might be nit-picky but I'm curious  to know if 76 models only used one snap. Maybe the second was added  later for more stability.  Because the table rests square against  the seat, it seems to be OK but I may go ahead and add the second one  anyway.  Never run out of things to question here.  One,  still-kicking, curious cat...KR
