Subject: Re: [T2] Couple of air circulation questions


It definately seems like the whistling is coming from my vent wing wind=
ow
or passenger door seal. What can be done about the vent wing window? It=

looks like replacing the seals on that guy would be a PITA. Plus the ru=
bber
looks to be okay, not dry rotten at least.

           I get a whistling as well around 60. The foam weatherstrippi=
ng

I think that there is also a pair of rubber bellows that the control ro=
ds
pass through to operate the flaps.  These could have cracked and torn,
allowing for a 'whistle' of air while the flaps are supposedly closed. =
 I
know that my vent-seals whistle while driving.  For awhile I thought I =
had
the same problem, but it was the vent-windows.
