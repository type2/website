I am looking for a late 60' s to early 70's type 2.  It needs to be in good
certified condition as I plan on doing alot of traveling this year.  I would
like a camper version but a standard bus will do.  I live in the Greater
Toronto area in Ontario, Canada.  I would also appreciate help with places
to look for one in Toronto.

Thanks,

Peter
