Subject: RE: [T2] &quot;Remanufactured by Bosch&quot; Alternator

&gt; My alternator is bad on my 74 Westy.  After pulling it, it 
&gt; has a &quot;Remanufactured by Bosch&quot; sticker on the side.  I read 
&gt; here that any alternator rebuilt by Bosch has a lifetime 
&gt; warranty.  I was wondering if that is indeed true, and if it 
&gt; is, where and how do I get it replaced?


Their warranty is 12 months, not lifetime:
