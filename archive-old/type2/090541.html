Subject: Re: [T2] replacement distributor

You might have mentioned it in a previous email, but you didn't
include what year/engine your bus is/has. check out here for
information on what distributor was stock on your bus.

many of the list vendors carry distributors. so I would check the
usual suspects.

&gt; Since everyone responded to my question regarding my 009 dist to get

&gt; condition of it after further inspection...so I figured I would go
&gt; with a new one....I have tried the two &quot;have it all&quot; places in
&gt; town...plus I tried  Autozone, Pep Boys, and Napa...nothing.
&gt; Anyway, according to the source from a fellow listee the Bosch # is
