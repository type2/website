Is your pulley stock? If not it could be that the 0 mark on the pulley is
off by a few degrees and TDC is not where the pulley says it is.  There was
an article in Hot VWs (I think) a month or two ago that showed how to check
for this.  Also you could do the pencil in the spark plug hole test.  Stick
a pencil in the hole and touch the cylinder. Turn the engine until you find
where it stops to go back in.  That is TDC.  Now look at the pulley. Does it
say you are at TDC?  That's about the only reason I can think of for that to
happen.

&gt; and so I checked it with my feeler guage.  The gap was bigger than it was
&gt; when I had the cylnder at TDC.  Moving the engine back to cylnder 1 at TDC
I
&gt; checked the gap again and it was 0.006, so I looked at the valves of #2
and
&gt; one of them was open farther than 0.006.
&gt;
&gt; So, I'm assuming that's normal, but wanted to check with the list to be
&gt; sure.
