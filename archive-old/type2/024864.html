we went and looked at the 70  westy with the owner today. it has been
sitting in a garage the last 2 yrs while he goes to school in san
francisco. wants 1200.00 for it. pretty clean, only rust we noticed was
2 small spots under windshield and the bottom metal on rear wing window
is nasty. upper cot is denim, child cot is there. only saw a few
pinholes in poptop canvas. seals look good . some done by po.engine
sounds god but did not drive as tag expired 97 and he's checking to see
if non-opped.says engine is losing power and has gas in oil? but it
didn't smell like it today_dot_came with air conditioning but is not hooked
up and he doesn't know if it works.monza mufflers. new brakes, new stock
carb and new tires but only 4ply-1400 lb ones. he spent alot of time and
tlc on it til he moved. needs someone to care for it. two guys are
coming back to look at it tomorrow and might buy to drive to mexico. if
you'd like more info... # here for him is 209-521-4015. his email in s.f
is ellars3_at_earthlink_dot_net or if you want to ask us more email or call
