Subject: Relocated Batteries

Thanks everyone for the ideas on what to do with my battery.  Granted,
batteries pretty much take care of themselves, but when I do have to mess
with them, they are a pain!

I got this idea from my Mother's Oldsmobile.  A remote positive terminal.
Could be hooked up and isolated inside the hatch, making jump starting
pretty easy.  As for removing and replacing the battery, I'm still working
on that, but I like the idea of an outside door just for the battery.
