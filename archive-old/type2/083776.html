&gt; wheel.

No it doesn't, though I try to keep them in the same place.  The balls in
the CVs are matched to the CV and shouldn't be swapped.

&gt; man do i really have to take apart that whole c/v to replace the boot !
&gt; should have got the leaky kind you bolt on.

You only have to take one CV off the shaft to replace the boots.
