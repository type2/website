Volks,

This is from the VW service manual for '74-'79 busses. VW-90.4.jpg shows
where you can cut a hole to access the fuel gauge sender.

No use bookmarking these files or creating links to them as they will stay
on the web for only a few more days. However, I shrunk each page
sufficiently so it can be printed out.  Feel free to suggest ways to improve
future scannings as I'm new at this.

Previous scans include the following 4 on wheel alignment:

And 2 scans on how to lift and tow a bus:

I'll include a pertinent comment by Dave Easterwood regarding the lifting:

&gt; Be VERY careful when jacking up the rear according to this image...
&gt; 
&gt; You would be better off jacking at the reinforcement where the cross
&gt; member &amp; outrigger meets the longitudinal frame member about 6 inches
&gt; forward of where they are supporting it in the image.
&gt; 
&gt; Notice there are 2 small tubes an inch or two outboard of where they
&gt; are lifting in the image...  those house the hand brake cable and the
&gt; clutch cable.
&gt;
&gt; A PO of my 68 jacked there &amp; bent the clutch cable housing which now
&gt; puts too much pressure on the cable resulting in a very heavy clutch
&gt; pedal action and I will have a hell of a time replacing the clutch
&gt; cable when it breaks.
