Subject: Re: [T2] 15&quot; mercedes steel wheels


[...]


&gt; OK, I know that gowesty has these wheels.  And a
&gt; listmember proclaimed that these are available much
&gt; cheaper.  But who has them?  What are the specs?
&gt; Everyone I call says they have nothing near our ET37
&gt; offset.  And what lugs do I need?


Not sure where you are but..... in the USA, all Mercedes steel wheels [non-alloy
mag wheel] are 14''. They never offered steel 15's. Starting about 1979, the
last steel 'looking' 14'' wheel came on the 123 240D but it was an alloy wheel.
All the other models got alloy mag style wheels. Starting in 86 on the 126 body,
the wheels became 15'', but all 5 were mags. Only recently was the spare
different than the other 4, i.e. cheaper, but it still is alloy and 5 spoke.
Even the SLK spare is 15'' alloy with the collapsible tire like a 75 deluxe
Westy. [The new C32 has no spare, it comes with a can of stop leak and a pair of
white cotton gloves!!]
In Europe, the large 126 [300SD, 420SEL, 560SEL,280SEL] came with hubcaps [mags
were an option, here they are standard] but I have not seen 15'' steel wheels on
them.
