Subject: Re: engine hatch open

It seems to be a dictum that the engine runs cooler with the hatch closed
IF THE ENGINE SEAL IS INTACT.  Otherwise the fan will suck in hot air
driven under the engine after it goes over the heads/cylinders.  This is
especially true in traffic where the hot air cannot be pulled away by a
fast moving vehicle.  Once parked, however, heat will have a chance to flow
upwards and out if the hatch is open. .   .Mike Benthin in NJ  _
