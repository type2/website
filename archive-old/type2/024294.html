&gt; I am looking for a type 2 bus. I don't know which year is better, and why. I have been told that if I want a camper van, that 74 on has a nicer kitchen, and the bunk is a double instead of a single... I'm looking at 71-82 vans...

 There's not much to choose between them. The '71 is often recommended
(in the USA) because it's the last/best year of the beetle derived,
&quot;upright&quot; engine. The other common recommendation is a '77 or '78, the
tail end of the &quot;pancake&quot; engined busses. '79 had a one-year-only exhaust
and from '80 they were &quot;vanagons&quot;. The condition of the ones that are actually for sale is much more important than the exact year, though.

&gt; When did the first water-cooled bus come?? 83?? If I were to purchase a camper van..which one is best?? How about a passenger van, again, which one would be best??

 Watercooling started in '83. There are different issues with these 
vehicles, hence there's another list for them.

 Also, if one were to hop up the engine with a few more &quot; wheaties&quot;..which displacement is best?? Will a Porsche 914 2.0L engine do well in it??

 This is easy to do badly. Despite what the magazines say it's actually 
quite difficult (read expensive) to improve on VW's development.
 The 914 engine doesn't generally provide enough benefit to warrant the
hassle and expense of using it. You end up with a VW with Porsche
running costs instead of a Porsche with VW practicality.

&gt; I know its subjective when you ask a general &quot; which one is best&quot; type question, but I need some history along with your opinions...

 Best source for history is the list archive. These questions have been 
asked before and if you spend a while browsing the archives of the list
on www.type2_dot_com (check out the technical articles in the type-2 library
there, too) you'll learn a lot about the dos, don'ts, hows and whys of
the beast we call a type-2.

 Hope this is helpful. Without wishing to be too snotty, can I suggest
you do some browsing on our website and then come back with more specific
questions: There's lots of folk here who'd be glad to help but many of
the answers you seek are already available, if you are prepared to spend 
the time digging for them.

Cheers,
	W.
