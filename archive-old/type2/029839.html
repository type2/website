&gt; I've seen quite a few messages about pulling a trailer behind a bus, but
&gt; most folks are pulling behind a Vanagon. What about pulling behind an
&gt; earlier model. I have a '71 pop-top with a stock 1600 DP. Can I pull a
&gt; trailer behind without frying the engine??

Yes you can.  The bus is rated for a 2000 pound load, so if you're empty
you can pull a trailer with a fair load on it.  What you _can't_ do is
load up the bus and pull a trailer!  It's 2000 pounds whether it is in the
bus or on a trailer.

Obviously, handling would be a lot better with the load in the bus, but
sometimes there are good reasons to use the trailer approach.
