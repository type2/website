Subject: Bentley on Automatics

Ok, still working on friend's 77 automatic. Consulting the omniscient
Bentley, which clearly states through 1979 on the cover. Flip to the
section on automatic transmissions, which mentions something about the new
75 or 76 transmissions being different, and that's about it. I look at the
bottom of the page, and it's copyright 1976. Upon random looking, I then
notice that various pages of the book are copyrighted as early as 1974.
So, what about the 010 (I think that's right) automatics? Are they the
same as the Vanagon automatics for the air cooleds? I have a vanagon
Bentley I can check this evening, but I was just wondering if anyone else
knew of a later edition Bentley, or anything else, because the one I have
isn't helpful at all. Thanks,
