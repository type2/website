I am in desperate need of help from you folks.  Two days ago my '78
Westy(Lucille) was broken into in my own drive way.  The theif(ves)
proceed to tear out my stereo and take it.  Now the stereo is not why
I'm upset, I'm upset because the theif used a pry bar to remove the tape
deck and in the process took chunks out of my dash board.  Does anyone
know how I could go about repairing this (i.e. do I need to replace the
dash? where can I get a new dash?) Any help would be greatly appreciated
by both Lucille and me.  Thanks.
