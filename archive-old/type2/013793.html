I know this thread kinda died out but I think I have a 
doozy. I have a 72 Westy. A PO had installed an electric 
fuel pump. During the course of a tuneup at least 4 
years ago, I replaced the round silver thing I thought 
was a strange fuel filter with your standard inline 
filter. Today while catalog browsing i happened on the 
page with the electric fuel pumps and read that they 
require a pressure regulator. Said regulator is pictured 
below as round silver thing. I immediately ran to the 
garage and combed my meager spare parts collection to no 
avail. It must have ended up in the trash.
sigh
Does this make me extremely lucky for not having gone up 
in flames?
