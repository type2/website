They are to be mounted on the Westy. The Westy I bought as a project and 
almost have it road ready, it will be used for Whitewater Kayaking and 
Hiking/camping trips. The EVC is much to fragile and low to the ground for 
the use above. Besides it is my spouses daily driver (2 miles to work). We 
use the EVC alot for traveling and not enough for camping (IMHO). The engine 
is mounted inline with the front axel. The 95 EVC comes with drivers side 
airbag. The wheels, are also 15 inch on the EVC, not 14 like the Vanagon.

&gt;Do you use the Aegilis on your Westy or EVC?  With the
&gt;relative luxury of the EVC, do you use the Westy much
&gt;for camping?  Is the 5 cyl of the EVC mounted
&gt;tranverse or longways?  Ever thought about adding a
&gt;driver's air bag to your EVC?
