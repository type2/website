&gt;
&gt;what octane should we use? i usualy get 89, is this right?
&gt;

&gt;From the 78 owners manual, it says to use Regular, 91 RON. This translates 
to CLC 87 [(R + M)/2]
I was trying to find an online chart of RON --&gt; CLC but I haven't found it 
yet. An interesting site is

   Read part 3 of 4. Even talks of using mothballs....
