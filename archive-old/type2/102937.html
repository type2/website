Subject: Re: [T2] Long Mirror

i have been told that the rear end of the bus is sagging if the mirror
only shows the road directly behind you... see, i have this problem and
was asking friends for one of those LONG mirrors... that is when they
explained the sagging rear syndrome. i know i need to replace my shocks,
but there is something else that can lift it according to this friend.
someone else suggested getting coil-overs, whatever those are... i dont
know much about these busses... i have just had mine a year and cant
believe all the things i have learned so far... and still there is so
much i have yet to learn.

&gt; 2. The long stem mirror improves the rear visibility as it allows  the
driver
&gt; to look back down the road at length, rather than down onto the road
&gt; directly behind the bus.
