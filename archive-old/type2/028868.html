Some materials, called Diamagnits, do not have intrinsic magnetic dipoles,
(that is they are not paramagnetic), but dipole moments may be induced in
them by the action of an external magnetic field. If a sample of such a
material (screw driver) is placed in the nonuniform magnetic field near one
pole of a strong magnet(speaker magnet), a (very weak) magnetic force will
act on the sample (screw driver). Diamagnetism is a property of all
materials.

You can set up these dipoles and they will stay until you shack the out.
Just place the tip on a magnet pull it straight away and place the screw on
it. You could tap the tip on the magnet to help set up the dipole, but then
don't shack it.

Subject: [T2] Hints from Heloise - Mag Tip Screwdriver


Thanks, all!!  I got my NEW points installed, with the dwell on my NEW
digital (It cost $15 NEW - Sunpro 7676 model too.  Analog dwell/tach was
$5.) dwell/tach reading 45.6...

OK.  Every one said to take your magnetic tipped screwdriver and use that to
set the screw in the points assembly.

Opps, I did not have one!!  (In an emergency, I would normally put some
masking tape on the tip of my screwdriver - philips or blade- and force the
screw onto the tip.  The screw will stay on the tip of the 'driver, and I
usually can get the screw set into the hard-to-get-at hole.)

But I did have a magnet on the tip of my magnetic pickup.  (Any magnet will
do for this old trick.  Think about the magnet in the any one of your car
radio speakers.  Even the single speaker, original equipment, under the
center grill on you dash board.  It's probably still there.)

I simple 'stroked' the tip and the edge of my blade screwdriver with the
tiny (but strong!!) magnet, and I had a magnetic tipped screwdriver!!

OK, for all you technical experts out there, would it have been better to
stroke the screwdriver tip only one way, or back and forth?

Barry sends  '78 Westy (Later, I bought a new Bosch points from Olympic at
$1.71.  Cheap, so why keep an old set of points in the vehicle as a backup.
At that price,,, Again, thanks all.)
