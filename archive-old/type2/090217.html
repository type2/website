Subject: Re: [T2] Getting ready to pull rear brake drum and have a few
 questions...

&gt; 1. According to Bentley, I'm supposed to use a drum puller. According to the
&gt; list archives, all I need is a hammer and a prayer. Since the drum or
&gt; splines are stripped, is this even going to be an issue? If a puller is
&gt; recommended, where can I find one?

Usually they just come right off. you might need to back the brake pads
off if the drums are worn badly. I usually pull the drum with the tire
on as it gives good grab area.


&gt;
&gt; 2. My experience with Bentley instructions is that they always seem to leave
&gt; out an important piece of information (or bury it 20 pages later). I've
&gt; never done a brake job before, but after pulling the engine, replacing the
&gt; clutch/throw-out-bearing/plate I'm feeling pretty confident in my abilities,
&gt; but not so confident about Bentley. Any useful &quot;tricks&quot; I should be aware
&gt; of?

naa.just put them back the way they come off. clean everything well. lube
(antisieze) the adjusting stars.

&gt;
&gt; 3. I didn't have the cash to replace the other drum (hoping I can have it
&gt; turned). Am I going to have to do anything special since one side will have
&gt; a new one?

No. But I dont get the drums turned as I want to get max life out of my
bus parts. you can break the glaze with some sandpaper.

&gt; 4. I've got a new drum, new shoes, and a rear brake rebuild kit. I know I'm
&gt; going to need a 46mm socket. If a hammer can be used instead of the puller,
&gt; are there any other special tools (home-made or otherwise) that will be
&gt; helpful?

Nothing beats a 3/4&quot; breaker bar and 46mm socket. I vought my breaker for
6$ at a Ga pawn shopand spent like 35 for an SK socket. :) This you can
buy japanese at a discount tool place like northern etc.

 &gt;
&gt; 5. I've got a floor jack, but no stands. I'm planning on doing one side at a
&gt; time. Do I really need to buy a set of stands for this?

No. Is the jack tall enough? You need aither one of those monsters or an
SUV floor jack or you need to get creative. You will have to lift from the
beam or the jack point and its too tall for most typical floor jacks.
I usually use some extra wood block or something to get it up high enough.
good luck
