&gt; Robin and Peter from Chico found my name on the AIRS list and dropped

&gt; A German mechanic rebuilt everything properly but they
&gt; apparently were running super hot (~260 oil temp) on the breakin.  
&gt; Properly
&gt; timed 009 dist. because his vac advance is worn-out, I offered him one 
&gt; out
&gt; of a few that I have but the numbers don't match (we will look on the 
&gt; dizzy
&gt; site).  Only other thing I can think of is lean running, from vac leak 
&gt; or
&gt; mixture.

Quick thoughts:
	- Perhaps they've got a stuck oil galley plug, causing the oil to 
by-pass the cooler and run super hot
	- a rag or something caught in the fan -- time to reach around and 
feel if anything's there

Have they noticed any trends when they're adjusting their valves?  Any 
valves generally loose or tight?
(hopefully they're adjusting them as often as they can...?)

cheers,
