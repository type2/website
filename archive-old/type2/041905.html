Subject: Alternator and battery questions

Hey all,
Can any of you electrical gurus tell me if (and how) I can ruin alternator
by trying to suck too much power from it? I have '76 bus T4 2litre with
aftermarket stereo. Nothing monster though, just sony head unit (4x25W)
wired with two mids and two tweeters on the back channels and one double
wired subwoofer on the front channels. I play it quite loud and sometimes in
the night (=with headlights on).
I lost my alternator week ago. I changed it, and I don't know it's exact
failure, but I guess there is ummmmmm..... how to say it in english.... diod
circuit dead, plus maybe those carbon things bad. Electrician will ring me
with details as soon as he look at it.

The second question: how can I install the second battery? I plan to instal
bigger stereo, icebox and some other electrical stuff. Is there some easy
way to upgrade to twin battery setup?
Which parts, wires from where to where?
Please advice!

TIA

Jan
