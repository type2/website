Subject: Gas leaks?

So I'm bopping down I-70 doing 70mph (hey, speed limit's 75 and I'm only at
half throttle!) and the GWB starts bucking, then stops running altogether.
Hmm...

I kill the ignition and pull off to the side of the road. Open the hatch...
Bah. The inlet pipe to the right carb popped out. Grrr... Fuel everywhere. I
put it back in, grab a flathead screwdriver and a picklefork to use as a
hammer and peen the opening around the pipe. Feels tight.

I wiped everything up and went on my way.

I love things that can be &quot;fixed&quot; in 2 minutes on the side of the road.
Safety wire is getting installed tonight.
