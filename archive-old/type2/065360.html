&gt;Hello to all who are listening,
&gt;Once again I have come upon something troublesome and I
&gt;am greatful to have the collective wisdom of this list
&gt;available. My problem is this. I attempted to adjust my

&gt;the distributer. I also lined up the notch in my pully
&gt;with the seam in my fan housing (This is a T4).
&gt;I then proceeded to loosen my intake and exaust valves
&gt;on the #1 cylinder. The exaust came loose ok but the intake
&gt;side has a problem. I can completely remove the adjuster and the
&gt;valve still sits on the rocker arm. What does this mean?
&gt;Is my head trash? Thanks to all

It probably means you're not at TDC for number one even though you should
be.  Double check that the rotor is pointing at the number one plug wire
(don't trust the notch in the distributor body).  The notch in the pulley
needs to be lined up with TDC on the timing strip - I don't know the
significance of the seam in the fan housing.  If the strip is missing it's
at about 11:00.  You can tell TDC because the engine will feel the
&quot;loosest&quot; at TDC as you move the fan back and forth in that general area.
Good enough to adjust valves by.
