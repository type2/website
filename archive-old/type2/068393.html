Subject: Re: Vanagon heat shield?

In a message dated 96-07-26 07:07:11 EDT, you write:

&gt;I have the  narrow shelf that your talking about. I was told that it
protects
&gt;the engine from flying debris, some kind of stone protector. Now that you
&gt;mention it I think the guy might be right and that it is a heat shield as
the
&gt;construction is like a sandwhich, the filling being what looks like asbestos
&gt;type material! (Its also in a strange place for stone protecting!!)
&gt;

That seems to be the concensus. David Schwarze said these things were prone
to rust out. It's also possible that since my original round muffler has been
replaced with a flat muffler that sits at a 45* angle the shield was removed
for clearance. I also suspect that all my rubber parts aren't missing due to
just carelessness,  rather they were possibly &quot;baked&quot; to bits once the shield
was removed. I think that I am going to try to work some aluminum flashing in
there to approximate the shield.

&gt;On the point of &quot;buying the various grommets&quot; what response did you get. I'm
&gt;looking for rubber and plastic parts myself. A recent problem saw the end to
&gt;my fan cage and generator surround. Is there a &quot;plastics and rubber kit for
&gt;old busses&quot; available any where?! If you no what I mean :)
&gt;
&gt;

They had all that I asked for. If you're not convenient to a dealer I'd be
happy to check for you next week when I go back to pick these up. I'm not
aware of a &quot;bag o' grommets&quot; kit. Recently I bought a fan cage from Busboys
as well as a new oil filler pipe.
