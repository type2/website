Hi all -

Firstly, THANK YOU to all members who responded to my earlier &quot;Exhaust leak&quot; 
postings.  Gracious Oklahoma Bill K. is checking into a few specific 
questions for me today.

So as not to overburden Bill, I thought I'd address some more &quot;pop up&quot; 
questions that...popped up/into my head this a.m.

1)  I checked the archives for heat exchanger testing procedures.  I ran 
across a 11/96 post from Ben Brigham describing a procedure in which he 
plugged the fresh air ports w/wood plugs, then sealed w/acrylic latex caulk. 
  One of the wood plugs sported two holes; one w/a bicycle tire valve, the 
other w/a tube over which a balloon was placed.

This is a great way of checking, but being a psuedo-slacker, I was hoping 
for a more simplistic way of doing things.  Anyone?  Initially, I'd thought 
about somehow blocking off the exhaust ports (where they connect to the 
headers), then pouring liquid through the exhaust manifold.  However, due to 
lack of pressure, this probably wont do the trick.  Also considered blocking 
&amp; blowing smoke through.  While this may have some neat illicit 
applications, just doesn't seem all that practical/accurate.

2)  What do volks use to ensure a good seal between the exchangers &amp; the 
connecting pipes that run to the heat flaps?  When I'd initially removed, I 
found a remnant of some sort of sealant material.  The material didn't seem 
like it was silicate-based.  Dunno.

3)  Anyone have a &quot;spare&quot; heater flap cable spring?  If you're here in 
Colorado, I could come p/u.

On that note, any good procedures for ensuring correct adjustment for the 
heater flaps?

4)  I'm replacing my self-destructed Empi gaskets that go btwn exchangers &amp; 
exhaust headers w/the metal ones that came w/GEX rebuild.  The gasket btwn 
exhaust &amp; muffler also self-destructed, so I figure on cutting one today 
from hi-temp fiber gasket material (thickness escapes me right now); is it 
okay to use gasket maker to supplement, or should the fiber do just fine?

5)  Another plea to CO volks:  Anyone have some recommended VW mechanics in 
the Denver metro area?  I'm east of Aurora, will travel.  Had a couple of 
suggestions, trying to bulk up my list.

Any high-altitude must do's?  I grow slightly apprehensive when I think 
about strapping a canoe(s) up top, throwing paddling gear in back, plus 110 
lb. &quot;El Pollo&quot; the super-poochie &amp; making for the big, pointy hills.  I know 
I have to have my timing &amp; fuel-air mixture readjusted; I can't do, &amp; I 
can't afford to have done right now.  Am I courting disaster if I drive 
around mostly-level town?

The remainder of this morning will be spent JB welding the air pipe that 
runs behind the fan (has crack running through bolt hole for connection to 
'Y' tube), evenly filing the tops of the exhaust pipes on exchangers to 
'clean' metal, &amp; looking at the &quot;unknown cannister&quot; near right/rear tire, 
wondering if those two tubes HAVE TO BE connected.  Oh yeah, &amp; looking for a 
j-o-b.

TIA &amp; sorry so long,

Mark

Nikki E - could you send me a price for the one exchanger? - don't know if 
I'll need, yet.  Just getting ahead of myself, as usual.
