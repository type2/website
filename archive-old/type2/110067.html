&lt;&lt; Ok, quick question... I know this may be silly.. but....

Has anyone here ever AutoCrossed their Volkswagen Transporter or
Westfalia? Just curious.

I autocrossed a 1983 Volvo 240 TurboWagon back in the day... needless to
say I had one of the slowest times there.

Call the local chapter and get a copy of the re-

keep you out of trouble; if not inside the cones...
