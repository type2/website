Volks,

As you might guess, these posts from Troy grow out of a chat session
yesterday where we had him diagnose his engine woes over the net.  a most
fascinating excercise!!!  He went out, got a compression tester, tested
compressions and got (as I remember):

  #3- 10psi        #1- 90psi
  #4-120psi        #2-110psi

We (kp, (real name unknown) and I had him back the adjuster off and try
again. #3 went up to 30psi.  Oil in the cylinder was no help.  so we had
him pull the rockers and check for uneven stems.  Stems on #3 were
(?both?)  very high.  At that point, we told him to put it back together
and call it a day.  John Anderson showed up at that point and after a bit
of consulting we decided he was best off removing the plug wire and
injector plug from #3.  Tho Troy says &quot;cracked&quot; my guess is that he will
find the classic dropped valve seat when he opens it up.  Final diagnosis
can await the head replacement, however, as that head will need
replacement no matter what.

Troy's situation, as I know it is that this is his sole transport, so
telling him not to drive is not really an option :-(  I had hoped that
John had a good used 2L head, John says *I* have his good used head.  A
quick search of my basement this evening turns up no head :-(  I still
need to go out to my garage (15 miles away) tomorrow before I give up, but
I am not hopeful... too damn many boxes :-(

On head interchange, as someone else said, 1.8 and 2L will fit the 2L jugs
w/o mods to the heads.  It would be best if he had a 2L, but if a 1.8 is
all there is, it will probably have to do.  1.7L has a smaller spigot
diameter and would need to be opened up, not to mention the extra pocket
that would *really* unbalanace his engine.

Troy, a question that occurred to me overnight... did you back the
adjuster off on #1?  did the compression pick up on that cylinder??  We
got so into #3 that we ignored the lesser evil on the other side.

I will go out to Springfield to look for the head tomorrow, but if someone
has a spare good used 2L head, please get in touch with him, eh?
