Subject: Re: [T2] which carb to use.

&gt; &gt; We are going to put a used 2.0l out of a 1978 into our 72 but the 
&gt; engine came
&gt; &gt; without the fI, my question is, we have a set of dellorto 36s or
&gt; &gt; proggressive weber carb, which should we run this engine with. thanks Dylan
&gt;
&gt;find the fuel injection for this engine

First choice would be to get the fuel injection back on the motor.

Or send me the Dells and use the Weber (in other words use the Dells!).

I've got dual 36mm Dells on my Type IV powered Beetle. Nice carbs. Not 
nicer than the fuel injection. The Weber is a hunk of junk in the center 
mount config on a VW. Worked fine on the wasserpumper OEM application. I 
think they were on the German Fords we had in Italy.

Took alot of $$$ and time to get the Dells dialed in with the correct air 
cleaners, correct jets, etc. If you aren't familiar with Dells buy a good 
Dell carb book. You'll also need some good linkage. All told I bet I've got 
four hundred 1995 dollars invested in making a pair of FREE Dells work 
CORRECTLY, and I did 100% of the work. ($100 for the linkage - fancy BAS 
linkage, $100 for jets, $20 for the book, $70 for the air cleaners if not 
$90). That does not include $120 for short special BAS intake manifolds to 
fit the Dells on a Type IV in a Beetle. Oh and 4 shorty velocity stocks as 
well for some more $$$. And a gasket kit. And bolts. And about a bunch of 
hours to figure out how to make it just right. They stayed right though. 
The car is apart and in storage but due to no fault of the carbs. They were 
100% right until the day I took it all apart. Mid-20's mpg.

Get the fuel injection going. It's easier.
