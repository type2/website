IMHO you'll have to check ALL fuel line fittings, and the lines where they pass
thru the firewall.  That is a potentially disastrous  leak.  Good thing you
weren't driving.  There are many list members who can tell you of engine
compartment fires that consumed their busses.

&gt;  there was a rather
&gt; bad looking puddle. I smelled it and yep, gasoline! So I am trying to figure
&gt; out before I tear things apart what could be causing this, any ideas??
