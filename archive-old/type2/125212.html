Subject: Heat Exchanger Question.

I think my heat exchangers are toast. I'm getting exhaust up through my air
vents. I took the accordian tubes off of them to keep the exhaust from coming
up. Well, they almost fell off they were so rusty. :)

Is their anything else I need to do? Heating the bus right now is SOOoooo low
on my list of prioritys. Should I block off the outlets or anything?

TIA
Chris
