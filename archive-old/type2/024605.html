I wrote in last week about my bus.It was idleing wierd. I got 1 reply (thanks)
and was told that I was probably a leak in my intake manifold. I think that it
was and so I replaced the manifold gasget. It looked pretty easy. what a pain
in the arse.Any how now when I start it it will idle fine for a while,
seemingly better than before then just cut out. I have been racking my brain
for a week now and its killing me. I dont really have the funds to bring it to
the shop. what should I do. Any people in the Tempe Ariz. area that might be
able to help me out for a small fee or somthing please e-mail me. I havent
even been able to drive it yet and it soon will be too hot to work outside
arrrg......
