Subject: Re: [T2] Welding your VW-braizing?

At 07:12 PM 1/3/02 -0500, you wrote:
&gt;I'm pretty familiar with braizing because of bicycle frames- can anyone
&gt;comment on or say why braising wouldn't work on small panel holes as it
&gt;uses a much lower temp than welding?  

You'll still find brazing is a PITA as you put too much heat into the
metal.  That said before I had the MIG I braized on entire rockers, it
works, just the standard problem of being able to get to the back side
of what you did, how much you warp the metal, etc.  Brazing is jim
dandy for small pinholes in places where you can get to both sides
and particularly for places with some structure to em that tend not to
warp (ie floor pans)

And if you got a gas setup or even an straight acetylene plumbers
&quot;swizzle&quot; torch it is a nice cheap alternative, even for major work.  Might
not strictly be as strong as welding but sort of depends as often you
get a lot more contact area brazing.  The combination of brazing and
flanging repair panels with my pneumatic flanger worked pretty well as
the flange gives a bit of stiffness to the old panel.  Like I said, I've done
entire rockers that way before I had the MIG, today I wouldn't.
