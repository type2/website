Subject: Manassas bug out worth going to sell T2 parts?

I have a a number of T2 73 to 79 parts to sell.  Is it worth going if it has 
changed focus to H20 vehicles?  Are there going to be T2 people there looking 
to pick up some parts at the swap meet or more to see the show?

I am close to having a complete 2L performance T4 engine and 5 rib 091 
gearbox for sale, it depends on what happens in the next couple of days.

If you are looking for a part ask me.  I have no camper items.


Robert
