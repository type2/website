I have had success getting thru on the 800 number,

they were very helpful (I called in the morning).

Heard they do like faxes, before they signed off

the type2 list they recommended faxes.

I have been trying to place an order for a catalog

with them for two months, no luck, they have told

me to call back in three weeks, etc.

Hope they get their act together soon because they

sound like a good source.
