Subject: Re: [T2] torque wrench


The best tools to look for are at estate sales and sometimes garage sales.  
Nothing like paying a few bucks for a good set of S-K wrenches, or a MAC 
impact-wrench.  Don't shy away from the quality used tool.  I stress the 
word 'Quality'.  Sometimes you get more than what you pay for.  :^)
