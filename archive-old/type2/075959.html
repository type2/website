Subject: Re: [T2] solid/hydraulic swap?

FYI the Hydro and solid cams have 2 different profiles.
----------------- Yes ----------------------------------
I've been yelling this at list members for about a year. They keep
calling me stoopid. I can't but wonder how many engines are dead because
of this unorthodox parts swapping. There has to be a reason that cam
grinders give the solid lifter and hydraulic cams different part numbers
....... think about it.
---------------
By the way Jake I fixed my high engine temp and excessive oil pressure
problem........... I filed a bur off of the bypass plunger. Small bur but
significant when checked with a micrometer.
