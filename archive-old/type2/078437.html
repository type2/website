Subject: RE: RE: [T2] driving w/o windshield [was: replacing windshield andrubber together?]

I don't know from whence you gather that.  Fire your gatherers.   Never said &quot;all vehicles must have windshields.&quot;   If given a ticket here in one of my courtrooms, you'd lose your case with the defense &quot;motorcycles don't have them, so I don't have to either.&quot;   In my state, one of the correct charges would be defective equipment, you are correct.
