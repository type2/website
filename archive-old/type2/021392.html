Hi folks,

got towed into Charlottesville a few days ago.  Broken clutch operating cross shaft.  I have a place to stay, but the engine is out and can't move until I find another cross shaft.

Any leads on where I could find a cross shaft for a 68-70 bus.  Willing to buy a transmission if the price is right.  Can get a ride within a few hours of Charlottesville.
Any suggestions would be appreciated!!!

thanks,
Will
