&gt; First, the six bolts surrounding the flange on each CV boot are,
&gt; according to Bently, supposed to be hex socket bolts.  However, after
&gt; cleaning the gunk out of the sockets, we discovered that mine look more
&gt; like a 12 point torx socket.  Six point size 40 torx bit fit just fine
&gt; but didn't give enough grab to loosen the bolts.  Since I didn't want to
&gt; strip the bolts, we stopped right there.  Does anyone know what I need
&gt; to get these bolts out?  Should I replace them with the hex socket bolts
&gt; for ease of removal/replacement?

It's a triple square or sometimes called a serrated wrench. Get the right
tool in case this happens again in the future.

Visit your VWFLAPS. They either have BugPack Tool #7057 or EMPI #5796.

...or try Pepboys for K-D which for the same price as the socket you'll get
4 bits (6-8-10-12mm I think) which fit into a  3/8&quot; socket...

&gt; Second, to find the source of the squeak (increases in frequency with an
&gt; increase in speed and vice versa) we went to get into the brake drum,
&gt; thinking that a pad may be rubbing.  Removed the two bolts that are
&gt; supposed to allow the drum to be removed and it would not budge, on
&gt; either side.  Am I missing something here?  According to Bently, it
&gt; shouldn't be necessary to remove the castellated nut to get the hub off.
&gt; We tried to use the adjusting nuts through the rear of the hub to pull
&gt; the pads back but the would not budge either.

It sounds like what happened to me: the drum has rusted to the hub.  There's
actually not much surface area to contact the two but it's likely rusted
together.  Get a big hammer and give the drum a couple of good whacks.  I
bet it comes loose and then you can wiggle it off.
