Subject: Re: [T2] electric

&gt;&gt;Has anyone ever heard of somebody converting a VW van to an electric
&gt;&gt;vehicle ?

	A VW beetle was written up in Pop Mech  -  OK, it may have 
been Pop Sc  -  that could burn rubber at 90 mph.  Range was 
correspondingly low.  It has been known for many decades how to make 
a very powerful electric vehicle; range is the hard part.
