Subject: Starter/Solenoid - '79 bus

As previously reported, I am continuing to have intermittent problems
starting my '79 bus. Thursday, was the last straw. After a day of work, I
hopped in my bus and nothing. I had to push start again, so I ordered
a starter from my FLAPS. Sunday, I pulled the old starter (a Bosch 
reconditioned unit), and got ready to install the new starter. The old and
new solenoid do not have the same part numbers, and there is one less
wire tab on the new unit.

solenoid
old - part # - 0331 302140 -540
new - part # 0331 3602040   (the 6 may be a 0 - hard to read)

Does anyone know the difference? Do I have the wrong solenoid for a
'79 bus?

If I hold the old solenoid in its correct mounting orientation, there are two
tabs to connect to. The top tab had a wire going to my starter relay, and
the bottom tab had a wire that disappeared into a wire harness. The new
solenoid only had the top tab.

Also I checked continuity on the old solenoid, and there was none between
the two tabs.

Looking for advise.
