Subject: GUAGES AD NAUSEUM was re: 3 scoop question

Ok.  Next time I'll wait until I have the bux and time I'll instrument the 
hell outta everything.  I thought about it and decided that ambient
conditions vs results weren't that important.

VDO gauges outta the box. Sump plate mount for temp.  Pressure in usual 
place (need a picture?)  If you're interested in what's in the engine, 
there's plenty of posts made while it was being built, can be found by 
searching the archives.  Engine case temp determined with nifty infrared 
dealy a buddy has.

Since this is the Type 2 list, it might be safe to assume this all happened
with a bus.
AS far as the useless information, If I can provide further obfuscation,
feel free to pester.Thank you and have a nice day.
Mad uncle Dave

What do you mean by &quot;Engine temp&quot;?
What are the temperature readings before scoops and after?
What kind of gauges are you using?
What kind of transducers are you using with those gauges?
What is the location of the transducers?
Are your gauges calibrated?  And if they are how did you calibrate them?
What were the conditions of your test ie: air temperature, head wind, tail
wind, vehicle speed, duration of test, type of body style, type of engine,
any modifications to the engine?
I mean no disrespect but without defining variables the information is
worthless.  And with defining the variables the information is really
valuable to all us eager &quot;listees&quot;.
