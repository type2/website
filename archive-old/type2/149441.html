Subject: Re: [T2] fan housing

I had to change the oil cooler seals in my hightop in my driveway, since I 
could not get it into the garage.

My neighbors are really not supportive of me doing ANYTHING in the driveway.

I wanted the rear of the VW lifted so I could really swing around under 
there.  Also, my closeup eyesight focus point has moved to about 16&quot; away, 
minimum.  I cannot get a clear view of anything that  is clooser.

So I raised the rear of the VW until the tires were just clearing the 
pavement.  Then I let the VW down on a pair of jack stands under the rear 
axle tube and the tires then just DID touch the pavement.  I was able to 
sneak under there and work behind the VW because I would block the view of 
the rear off with other vehicles I had available.  This way the hightop sat 
on jack stands for about 4 weeks while I puttered around whenever I had the 
time.
