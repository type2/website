Subject: found the problem with my valves (73 bus)

I took a closer look at the valves, and #3 intake
was 1/4&quot; shorter than the other stems.

Pulled the engine, pulled the head.  valve seat
has moved, valve with it.  The valve was banging
into the piston.  about 1/8&quot; deep gouge in the
piston.

I am now looking for a shop to repair the head,
also looking for prices on a new head..

Any suggestions on what I should do about
the piston?  The connecting rod could have
been damaged.  The piston was slightly
damaged, but it doesn't look like it is enough
to change performance.  It isn't cracked.

Thanks,

Jen
