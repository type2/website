&gt;I reinstalled the &quot;bad&quot; AFM and all the symptoms returned. I put the &quot;good&quot;
&gt;one back in and all the symptoms disappeared.

I had the exact same problem!

all the specs for my AFM were within range but she ran like crap (77 2.0L 
FI).  I borrowed a known working AFM and she ran great.  I ended up 
disconnecting the temp sensor on my &quot;bad&quot; AFM (open up the AFM...in the 
archives..and unplug from the terminals inside).

I wasn't sure if this would make it run too lean or too rich and didn't want 
to risk it so I am waiting on a rebuilt AFM from the bus depot.

I'm not sure if this helps.
