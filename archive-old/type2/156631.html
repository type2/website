There are / have been machine shops that specialize in
welding up the affected areas and re-machining. Some
do it better than others. When you weld in an area
like that, the molecular structure of what is added as
well as the areas affected by the heat of welding is
changed. If the alloy used to weld is exactly the same
as the original, the entire unit can be equalized
(theoretically) by heating it all as one unit then
allowing it to cool slowly. The machining is then
done.

I guess it depends on how confident you are that it
will be done correctly - I have heard more than one
machinist refer to welded cracks saying that if it was
cracked, it will be cracked. I don't totally agree
with that, but he has repaired probably thousands of
them and I have done none!

I have vastly oversimpified the process to relate the
general idea. Hope it helps. -BaH
