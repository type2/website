Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Tin &amp; POR-15


&gt;I'd forget about trying to clean and paint the tin myself and go and have 
&gt;it powder coated.  It will still look good in five years when you plan to 
&gt;do your major restoration.  The beauty of getting it powder coated is that 
&gt;you don't have to do anything except take there.

The local shop will do 16 (!) wheels for $40 if you deliver it all 
sandblasted. They can do the sandblasting for you also for an additional 
charge. I use a local monument company (makes headstones) and they do good 
sandblasting cheap. Large batches are again most economical.
