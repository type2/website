&gt;  &gt; only after recently connecting w you all have i become aware of the 
&gt;  &gt; importance of correct engine tin.
&gt;  &gt; anyone know of a web page where i can see a diagram of the stock 
&gt;  &gt; configuration??
&gt;  
&gt;  The Bentley manual has a good exploded view of the lower tin, but I
&gt;  haven't seen a good view of the upper parts.  I figured it out mostly by
&gt;  close observation of the parts.  They only fit together well in one way.

Haha.  This brought back memories and made me laugh.  On my last stripdown I 
was having so much fun thinking how clean my engine will be when Id replaced 
all the seals and it wouldnt leak oil any more that I didnt take any notice 
at all where the tin went.  I took each piece, put it in the parts cleaner, 
scrubbed it, blew it, wire brushed it, primed it, then painted it with nice 
rustolium (you know the one I mean) paint.  It sure looked nice lined up by 
the wall drying.  Then I had to put it back on. It took me ages to figure out 
where all them pieces went.  Some I put on then had to take off as I had put 
them on in the wrong order.  

I firmly believe now that a pencil and paper and a bunch of ziplock bags are 
very important unless you want to end up with spare parts (which I usually 
do). Make notes when you take it apart and write on the bags where the nuts 
and bolts in them came from.  Even better I find is to use a digital camera 
and take pics as you go.

In the end I got it all back together. I did a great job and had almost no 
problems since.  Mind you, it never did stop leaking oil.......... 

I should add that the most important thing in cooling your bus (apart from 
the fan I guess) in the engine tin and the big seal that goes round the 
motor.  Mine used to get so hot it wouldnt turn over after a spin without 
letting it cool down first. Putting the proper tin on and getting the seal in 
right did the trick.
