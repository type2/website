Subject: Re: [T2] another emissions question

&gt; After reading Bob's post about the fans not reaching the air intake I
&gt; have a question. I am going for  emission testing next week.
&gt; In Connecticut they put your car on rollers and take it up to about
&gt; 35mph(not sure that real speed just a guess) with a probe in the tail
&gt; pipe. They have a fan mounted on a gate like setup they just swing out
&gt; in front of your car. If they test my vehicle on this set up
&gt; the fan will be useless for my bus? Should I not worry about it or could
&gt; this overheat my bus? Any CT listees been though this?

sounds like the same system used in Maryland.   Not sure how to deal with
this but I checked last time I was there (last Jan) and the way the fan
fits I doubt very much it would have any effect on cooling.  I would
suspect that if it was cold and it was for a short (2-3 minutes) would
probably not have an effect, longer times etc might cause
problems.  Wonder if Doc Tim has any information on this.  I know the fans
here would cool my sparetire/emblem on the front effectively but not much
else.
