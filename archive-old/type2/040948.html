Hi all.  I've a question for you regarding my '72 Campers brakes.
Front disk rear drum

I bought my bus from a junkyard and have been resurrecting it.   It runs
fine now and has a new clutch and exhaust, but the brakes are shot.  The
E-brake doesn't brake, thought the lines et all work, the brake fluid
reservoir was empty when I bought it, the brakes must be pumped to get any
function out of them, otherwise it goes almost (really) to the floor and it
feels like it's only my foot pressure that's stopping the bus.  The outside
of the drums are covered in flaking rust, the back plate on the drum
brakes-where you put a flathead through to adjust the star wheels has inch
long grooves where the metal has peeled back away from the star adjustment
points (from being adjusted), one of the stars doesn't move at all and
another you can turn till Tuesday without it doing anything.  Lastly, I've
never worked on disc brakes before.  Oh yeah, I live in an apartment and
while having an off the road uncovered parking slot, it is both very very
uneven and on a definite slope.

I'm thinking of taking Russ in to have someone else do the brakes.  I'd like
to take it to a little VW shop but their warranties aren't nearly as good as
say, Midas.  Has anyone had any experience with them and their lifetime
guarantee?
