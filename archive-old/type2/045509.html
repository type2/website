&gt; Does it seem that the thread has not attempted to answer the origina
&gt; question, but rather give reason to preach about individual opinions of
how
&gt; one should drive VWs?
&gt;
&gt; I believe the original poster simply wanted to know what RPM he should use
as
&gt; a shift point. I got no notion that he wanted to know how high he could
rev
&gt; each time without blowing the engine up.
&gt;
&gt; I can see the poor fellow sitting in a corner emitting a profound &quot;SIGH!&quot;
&gt; every few minutes, wondering how he could have been so misunderstood.
&gt;
&gt; All factory-tachometer-equipped automoblies have a redline shown on the
tach
&gt; face. I'll bet you that he'd be satisfied if someone would say where VW
would
&gt; likely have put it if they had equipped his machine with a tach :-)

I drive and shift by 'seat of the pants'. I don't have a tach. I upshift
when the power curve falls off. [if I want to get from point A to point B
right away]
It is too bad VW didn't put max shift points on the speedo until 80 in the
Vanagons. On those 1st is 19, 2nd is 34, and 3rd is 53. This still doesn't
tell you what the rpms are.....
Driving my 77 Westy, these shift points are about 1-2 mph below where the
power drops off (when it stops pulling).
[This is a USA 2.0L FI engine and the Vanagon speedos are from USA 2.0L FI
buses.]
