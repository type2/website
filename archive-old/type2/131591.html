Subject: Re: [T2] Type 1 engine Alternator Wiring instead of Gen....
  Solved???

I didn't see this before my last email, but Karl is right and it looks as if 
you got it.

&gt;From: &quot;Snoopy&quot; I wired up the alternator with basically only 2 wires going 
&gt;to it from the
&gt;bus wiring.
&gt;B goes to battery positive
&gt;And I spliced the gen warning light into one of the wires going into the 
&gt;new
&gt;regulator.

Should be spliced into the Red one(D+).

&gt;The new regulator has no designations at all, but did have colored wires.
&gt;I wired them according to the Bentley from the 72 wiring diagram.
&gt;The wires were red, green and brown.

&gt;This seems to work.  i.e. The gen light comes on when key is turned and 
&gt;goes
&gt;out after running a second.

Good luck,

Michael Knight
