Subject: [T2] Heating ducts

I was doing some investigation on my heat system the other day, and noticed 
that there's a duct that seems to come up someplace around or between the 
two front seats. A while back, somebody on the list said that the knob on my 
front seat managed this vent (while others said it was vestigial, for 
auxilliary heaters only). Well, I played around with the knob some, pulling 
and twisting every which way, lifting the carpets and feeling for airflow, 
but I didn't find a thing. Should there be some kind of vent in this area? 
Could that duct be blocked somehow?
