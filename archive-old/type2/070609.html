This brings up an interesting point. There is a fellow named Bear who 
lives out on the Eastern Shore. He is currently operating a 1980 
Vanagon that came from Ireland which has THE coolest camper 
conversion I have ever seen. The bus is Right hand drive and as such 
has its own set of problems. For instance is does not have a 
hydraulic clutch but instead is cable operated. Being RHD is not a 
standard cable and is rather hard to get. It also sports a duel 
carbureted 1600cc air-cooled motor that was common on Euro Vgons but 
never sold here. I am sure there other issues related to the bus that 
I missed but it illustrates the point of having to deal with a grey 
market vehicle.

The Irish bus entered the US with diplomatic plates and belonged to 
someone in the Irish Embassy. In fact there were two of them. When 
the Irish Statesman left to go home he decided not to take his buses 
and but instead sold them to a local DC person. Bear got it from 
them. Need to ask him about the title and such next time we camp.

The same issues may arise with some of the Canadian single and double 
cab Vgons that have filtered to the US. Many mechanicals are the same 
but body and interior parts can more of a challenge. A local club 
member has a mid 80s crew cab which suffered some body damage when a 
passing car tossed a wheel with brake drum still attached and it hit 
his bus. He was actually able to get the VW dealer to find  an NOS 
treasure chest door. It was not cheap:)

Good luck to David's folks. I know they love their bus as much as we love ours.
