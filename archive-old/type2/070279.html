Subject: [Q]-'66 Bus engine seals,tin

Hi. Thanks to everyone who helped with my fuel line questions. Now I have
another question which has been nagging me for a long time. I replaced the
rubber engine (motor) seals on my '66 Kombi a while back. The side seals
work well, but the front (FIF) seal has a gap of 2-3&quot; in some places. I
have a 1600 dp engine with a doghouse fan shroud. Am I missing a piece of
engine tin that should go in front of the fan shroud to complete the engine
seal? I got the seals from a '67 junkyard camper. They are about 2&quot; wide
and have the &quot;I&quot; shape on one side for fastening to the engine compartment,
and are shaped like the letter L on the other side, like this:

                engine compartment  I--&gt;   cooling tin

Another question: on the sides of the engine compartment, are the seals
supposed to be above or below the engine tin? They are now above the tin,
next to the spark plug seals.

Thanks in advance for your advice.

BTW, I was out of town during the engine vs. motor and friction vs.
combustion threads. I'm sorry I missed it. Please don't take this the wrong
way, but it was sort of like being at an ice cream convention where people
argue whether Chunky Monkey '92 was better than Chunky Monkey '93. My only
contribution to the friction vs. combustion debate is to try the following
experiment: Rub your hand on a carpet really hard until it starts to warm
up (friction). Next, put a lit cigarette into your hand. Which was hotter?
:) (Please don't try this at home).
