Subject: Re: Staying warm (in my '74)

Here's what I did, and it works pretty well.  Of course, here in Seattle
it doesn't get *that* cold, so if you live somewhere the temp drop to less
than freezing this may not work as well.

First, I took off the temp control flappers that determine how much hot
air gets into the cabin.  I then wired them open all the way.  It's not
like there's going to be too much heat.  These flappers are controlled by
the middle lever on the dash.  The cabls on mine had stretched out so much
that even in the wide open position on the dash thef  flappers wouldn't
open more than a third of the way.  I suggest everyone take the time to
make sure when the lever is down that the flaps really are open.  

Then I checked and fixed the insulation on the heat pipe.  I'm going to
put even more on soon, because there is a huge amount of heat lost this
way.  

I have pretty good heat now, enough that at 45 degrees I have to open the
vent occasionally to cool down.  It hasn't gotten too cold yet, but I
think even in the mid 30's it should warm the inside enought to stay
comfy.
