Guys, I know (Knew) a guy who died by using a catalytic heater in his VW bus. If
you want to use one that is not vented, DON'T! Especially if you have one of
those rare, well sealed busses.....

If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of
servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, go
home from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms.
Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains
set lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that ye were our
countrymen. -- Samuel Adams, speech at the Philadelphia
State House, August 1, 1776.
