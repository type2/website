Subject: the weasel feels better..no popping

Hello everybody!.....2L, el. ing., FI, 009 dizzy ( not the mech.only one) 
Rejoice!!

The clatter noise the weasel has had under load seems to be gone( or at least 
barely
audible). While tinkering around I noticed that the throttle return spring 
was just slipped on the throttle cable bracket. Not on the throttle valve lever! 
When I started
back up...no clatter. Went ahead and returned the timing to 5after. Still not 
as much
power on acceleration as there was _at_ 7.5before. But still a WORLD of 
difference.

I still need to drop the engine though. The bus came with 4 new plugs. The PO 
told
me it needed a tune-up ( it was a leaking injector). So I put the plugs in 
anyway.

300 miles later I ran a CT. #1 &amp; #2 came out _at_ 115 ea. Plugs looked like new.
#4 went 125 &amp; #3 went 107. Both plugs covered with black goo, not soot.
 But at least it doesn't look like I need to split the case. I'm just 
mentioning the above
so if anyone has one of those not so clear clatter noises. Check the throttle 
body too.
