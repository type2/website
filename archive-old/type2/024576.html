X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I don't knoe if this will help or not. I have seen on the early Bays, some
people drill out the original hinge pin and put in a retaining pin like the
ones used on hood hold down pins on reace cars and your neighbors hod rod
Mushtang. They can be had at most any True Value hardware or the like. But,
what this does is allow you to remove the lid and get it out of your way to
do work. The draw back is loss of security.

I have never seen a hinge o a '70 without a pin.  Chances are that it is
in there but so corroded to the hinge that you cannot see it clearly. 
Unless you are seeing a hole where the pin was.  It is quite an operation
to fix these because they have to be drilled out.  And you cannot do that
without removing the assembly.  The screws tend to be almost a corroded
as the pin.  You can find replacement screws at HD if you have to
drill/tap them out.

Whomever has the '71 van in Annapolis, i may be interested here in DC.
