Subject: Re: [T2] Before and after shots of seats using TMI covers

 Sorry, you didn't follow my directions in the text.

*I did.. And here are your original directions again..

&quot;You have to add the seats to this link below.
www.nisa_dot_net/~chook/TMI seats&quot;

I'll make it easier for  you.
 http://www.nisa_dot_net/~chook/TMI%20seats/

*That is to say, that this time you posted the url correctly?
(Gee.. Now it works!)

And please don't accuse me of something untrue because you didn't read
properly.

*I read it exactly as you posted it. No reason to get testy. It happens that
someone on another list that I am on has been posting SPAM messages with
links that go to pop-up junk sites. I now do not open links that I don't
recognize the sender. I was a little bit surprised, because I recognized
your name.
I wasn't &quot;accusing&quot; you of anything.
I guess we can write it off to a misunderstanding, but no point in taking it
personally...
unless you are the sensitive type..
But that would not be my problem.
The seats look great..
I hope we all feel better now.
