Subject: Re: VDO news, Summit Racing (update)

&gt;The greatest thing listed is the following:
&gt;
&gt;VDO 3-3/8&quot; 85mph Electronic Programmable Speedometer - features easy-to-use
&gt;calibration via LCD display.  Resettable trip odometer (Shows picture of a
&gt;nice looking speedo with an LCD trip meter).  $99.50 (120 mph version
&gt;also).
&gt;
&gt;I called Summit on this one, cause I HATE not having a trip odometer in the
&gt;bus, and to my disappointment, they told me that the speedo doesn't have a
&gt;regular odometer - just the trip one!  Bummer.  I got VDO's number and will
&gt;call them tomorrow and ask them just what the heck they were thinking!  If
&gt;this thing had a regular odometer plus a trip odometer, It would be the
&gt;ultimate upgrade.

I called VDO today, and the odometer is indeed dual purpose (regular
odometer plus trip odometer, switchable).  I can't blame the guy at Summit
for not knowing because it doesn't state that anywhere on the packaging,
according to the VDO guy.

This is an electronic speedometer, so it requires some sort of sensor to
drive the speedometer with electronic pulses, similar to how the tach works
I guess.  My bus has a regular speedometer cable, but I know that some
later model breadloaves had a sensor on the cable for the EGR light, and
I'm pretty sure I could adapt one of these to drive the VDO speedometer.
As soon as I find one in the junkyard, I'm gonna purchase the speedometer
and install it in my bus.

The guy at VDO said you set the speedo by pressing a button, driving
exactly one mile at any speed (can do this at those freeway speedometer
checks) and pressing the button again.  The gauge will take it from there.
Slick!  So is anyone else interested in this?
