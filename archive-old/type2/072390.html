Subject: A handy tool, fiber optic attachment

I was in  Fry's Electronic's yesterday and noticed a gadget for AA 
MiniMag flashlights. It is a fiberoptic attachment that looks like it 
might prove real useful for getting light into tight spaces and/or 
aiming it at specific spots. You just slip it over the flashlight 
lens, you can get either a 6 or 20 inch length of fiber optic

It also got me to thinking that fiberoptics would be a good way of 
illuminating dash gauges from a single source of electric light. 
LED's might be better through.

Anyway NiteIze, who sells the fiberoptic attachment, has a number of 
other flashlight gadgets. You can see them at their web site

Have a good weekend
