Subject: Re: [T2] REQ: pictures of sliding door mechanism

Chuck and Bradley,

Here ya go.  http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/78busdoor/sdoor-063.jpg

Shot is a little fuzzy...kinda like me at 6:15am, but you should be
able to see everything.  Only non stock part there is the white
tie wrap holding the rusty spring at the center.  The original part
died and this was the alternative.

If you need a better pic, please let me know...I do much better taking
pics in the afternoon&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey Chuck,
&gt; 
&gt; I too am looking for some pictures and or a diagram.  I posted something 
&gt; six weeks or so ago and got no response.
&gt; 
&gt; I have found out by fool'n around the the &quot;spring&quot; needs just a little 
&gt; tension on it to make the rear latch work.  I have jury-rigged a short 
&gt; piece or wire cable to a wire tie in the center of the door to provide 
&gt; the necessary tension so it work.
&gt;   If this is all too confusing let me know and I'll email you directly 
&gt; some pictures of what my door looks like.
&gt; 
&gt; Either way keep  me in the loop if someone sends pictures, I would love 
&gt; to see how it is suppose to be done.
