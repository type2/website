Subject: 3.5 mm vacuum line hint

Thanks, Richard Atwell, for your web site!!

Hint from Heloise - Vacuum hoses.  Look at the vacuum hose picture on 
Richard's site..

http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/VacuumHoses/VacuumHoses3.jpg

Notice that there is just a 2&quot; segment of 3.5mm vacuum hose, and a plastic 
line goes all the ways to the other end.  This is a (1) great way to save 
some lengths of 3.5 mm vacuum hose, and (2) makes the longest part of the 
vacuum line pretty bullet proof.

Now, for you junk yard scroungers, Heloise has noticed that each of the 
early VW Rabbit / Golf has at least a yard of this plastic line in their 
engine compartment.  It comes in different colors, and if you keep looking, 
different sizes.

&quot;OK, dear Heloise, SO WHAT&quot; you ask?!?!

These hanks of tubing in the VW Rabbit / Golf are often connected to the 
vacuum nipple with a rubber &quot;L&quot; connector.  These rubber &quot;L&quot; connectors are 
optimum for some vacuum nipples on the type 2.

For example, the throttle vacuum nipple, which is pointed FRONT (FIF) 
towards the firewall is a perfect spot to use a rubber &quot;L&quot; connector, and 
then a hank of plastic line to its final destination, to be connected at the 
final destination with another &quot;L&quot; or with 2&quot; of 3.5 mm vacuum line.

If you have an extra hour at a pick &amp; pull, you might want to lay up an 
adequate stock of this plastic tubing and the vacuum connector(s).  You WILL 
find a use for them in the days - months - years of air cooled VW ownership 
and maintenance. [Get as many vacuum connectors, in as varied a set of sizes 
as possible.  Try to get AT LEAST two of any unusual connectors, because if 
you can find use of one oddball connector, you will be sure to find use for 
the other oddball.]

Disclaimer:  I have no personal or professional or financial interest in 
this hint at all.
