Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof seal

Hiya Rus,

After finding out on the list that the felt seal is designed to keep dirt/debris
out and not water I have replaced with original seal with a weatherstrip felt
seal from my local hardware store.

I had to cut it to fit (it was to wide) and use a good bit of adhesive to adhere
it to the roof but it works well and shows no signs of peeling off.

It's a lot cheaper (~$20.00 felt/adhesive/etc.) then the stock VW seal.

HTH,
Harry

Quoting Rus &lt;rusb01_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;:

*&gt; Hey all
*&gt; Im looking for a sunroof seal for a 71 bus with a
*&gt; sliding sunroof and the salesman at wolfsburg said
*&gt; that one from a bus from the 1980's possibly could
*&gt; work if the two were the same size and dimention. Does
*&gt; anyone have a newer 1980 or over bus with a sliding
*&gt; sunroof and could you give me the measurements from it
*&gt; if you do?
*&gt; Thanks everyone
*&gt; Rus
