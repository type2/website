Blane:
I agree, the cotter pin seems fool proof, stone axe simple. However, the thing
that REALLY makes fasteners not come loose is having them the right tightness.
There are engineers on this list that could explain it better than I, but
basically, not so loose that normal forces will cause the connection to move and
not so tight that the threads or shank have begun to yield. Stressed, but not
strained.
Use a torque wrench!
The elastic goes on the outside, not compressed. If you're up to it you could
drill it and put in a cotterpin afterwords. Aircraft and race cars do. They
drill every damn thing and use stainless steel safety wire and a real slick
little twister. Nothing on a VW type 2 is subject to THAT much force and
vibration.
I agree, the steering is the LAST thing I'd want to fail, anywhere!
