Subject: Cracked head, hot motor, rblt tranny

It was apparent my current transaxle was 'borrowing' time for some months.
I chose to drive it down to Brax in Divide Mt and remedy my problem.   I got
down there last Friday night after work and slept in the bunkhouse.  I put
in a days work sorting used parts, restacking steering boxes, front ends,
shorty axles etc.  I sorted and hung a bunch of new accelerator, clutch and
brake cables and hung them on a new peg board.  All that kind of stuff I do
in an effort to repay Brack for the use of his shop and advice on Sunday
when the shop is closed.  I dropped my motor and tranny on Sunday.  I didn't
even get a core out of my old tranny, it was hammered, prob a inch high pile
of teeth in the bottom of the case.  After much debate I chose to go with
the rebuilt transaxle rather than roll the dice on a tested used one.  I
intend to drive this Dormobile for years to come and that out weighed the
$200 price difference.  
Since I had the motor out, I decided to retorque the heads, they were quite
close to spec., so that didn't explain my overheating.  When i attempted to
get the plugs out I met a lot of resistance.  After many many in and outs
with WD-40 inbetween, i got them all out.  Brack looked at me with much
disdain when he discovered I had plugs for a Type IV in there.  Way back
when I assembled all the pieces for a bug motor, I had ordered everything
from RMMW and assumed it was all correct.  Two years had elapsed between
acquisition and assembly.  Between 1/4 and 1/2 inch of thread was exposed in
the cylinders.  We hoped that this was the reason for the overheating, the
additional compression.  Before I put the new, correct, plugs in I was
cleaning around the plug holes when Brack noticed a crack around the #1 plug
hole, about 1/2&quot; long, from the edge of the hole out.  I noticed a second
crack on this hole as well, but none on the others.  Shit, just what I need.
So now I'm looking at new heads at a minimum.  We reassemble the thing
figgering I can get through the winter any way.  No super long road trips
planned and she'll play hell overheating in a Montana winter.  
So here's a question to ponder this winter:  Do I try and put new heads on
this Bergmann lower end and see what happens this spring?  or do I start
fresh with a whole new motor, sans hydraulic lifters etc and sell this used
motor in an old bug or something?  
On the way home from Butte/Divide I was just pleased as I could be with the
new tranny, I didn't realize a bus wasn't supposed to howl so loud you could
hardly hear the radio at hwy speed!  It had made that noise since purchase
and I thot it was part of the deal.  and shifting is a breeze!  Well worth
the $450.
Any comments on the new heads versus new motor question are welcome,
thanks
