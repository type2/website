Well, it didn't fit in the bus, but here's a story about what we carried on top:

When I was in college a friend of mine had a '73 hightop camper that he used
to abuse and loan out to his friends to abuse (it met it's end fully loaded
with concert goers en route to New Haven one night--cause of death:  No oil
:( ).   We took it down to a Salvation Army when we were looking for a couch
for his dorm room.  There was a great deal on a pair of matching full sized
couches.  His girlfriend decided it would be neat to have the same couch in
her room so we loaded two OLD, HEAVY full sized couches on top of his
fiberglass hightop van, one sitting upright, the other stacked on top.  We
bought some rope at a local hardware store to lash everything down.  Neither
of us did well enough in physics to know for sure if it would make the 25
mile trip back to campus, we sorta relied on the only constant we were very
familiar with (gravity) and used a lot of rope.  (BTW, we made it without
getting blown onto our side--probably not good in the sense that it
encouraged us in the future to try even riskier stunts).

The night the van met it's demise (my friend and I weren't there in its
final hours), his friends who were driving it had it towed to a garage.
Since the garage was two hours away from campus and the engine was
reportedly shot, my friend decided not to salvage it and he abandoned it at
the garage (he really wasn't attached to the bus, his biggest regret about
abandoning it was the Theodore Drieser novel he left in the glove
compartment).  About 6 months later I decided to call the garage and see if
it was still there so I could run my own salvage mission.  After a few
choice words about my irresponsible friend who never paid for the tow, the
garage owner said he just wanted it out of his yard and if I picked it up by
that weekend he'd write off the towing bill.  In the end I wasn't able to
liberate it and I'm sure it died a slow, painful crushing death &lt;sob, sob&gt;.
