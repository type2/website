&gt; Bob, even if you don't use head gaskets, you have to compensate by using
&gt; barrel shims between the cylinders and the case.  The FAQ gives information
&gt; on this.  Link, anybody??

been running about 10 years with neither.  I do have them though.

&gt; What NEW compression are you reading with the other three cylinders??

3 &amp; 4 are 125psi

&gt; If they are running about normal psi, and you haven't compensated for a fly
&gt; cut head, then the heads may not have been fly cut?!?!?

may not, did ask for a fly cut.
&gt;
&gt; Did you lap the cylinders to the heads??  And did you use Prussian Blue to
&gt; confirm you had a good mating surface??  This would really show if the #3
&gt; cylinder upper fins were causing the cylinder-to-head mating surface to be
&gt; obstructed

no I haven't and it is #1 causing the problem not #3  which was fine
before I started, I had a dropped seat on both 3 &amp;4 both intake too. so
while engine was out and stripped &quot;Why not do both heads&quot; (outsmart self)
if I cannot get a decent seal with a gasket installed I will reinstall the
old head.

mumble mumble mumble. hate doing a job over especially one you have to
take so much stuff off to get to.
