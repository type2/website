Subject: oil change problems

     Yesterday I did my first oil change on my 79 Westy. I drained the oil and
removed the oil screen. The screen itself looked pretty clean, but the cap had
all sorts of grunge in it. Anyway, I cleaned the screen, cap, gasket , nut and
put it all back together ensuring not to over-tighten the nut. Tight and just a
little tighter. I also tried to make sure that that gasket was lining up
properly, and it appeared to be so. Now it is leaking oil from that seal. My
question is should I have used some sort of gasket goop on the gasket to make
sure that it stayed in place while I was tightening the nut?
     I most likely don't have the nut tight enough for a proper seal because I
was erring on the side of caution. I lack a Torque wrench. My kind neighbor has
one and I will borrow it tonight either way. I am wondering if I should drain
the oil again and reset the seal?
