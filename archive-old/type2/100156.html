Subject: Re: [T2] Beauty Rings (was another hub question) 

Hi David,

I've seen a 74 bus here-about's with beauty rings that I'm told came 
from a Chevy S-10. They looked great and I'm told they just snapped 
right in.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hey George and Ronnie and the rest of the list,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the replies. That answered my question. It
&gt; made me think of another one. Will any of the VW
&gt; chrome &quot;beauty rings&quot; fit our bus's rims? I have seen
&gt; them as an option on other air cooled VWs and wondered
&gt; if they would fit on the bay window bus rim. Thanks!
