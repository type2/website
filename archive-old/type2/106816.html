Subject: Re: [T2] Where was you when da lights went out?

&gt; &gt; While I was wiring up the ignition bypass, I inadvertently bumped something
&gt; &gt; that caused the instrument lights to go out.  I'm guessing a wire, but
&gt; &gt; wondered if there was a common boo-boo that would cause this condition to
&gt; &gt; happen.
&gt;
&gt; It's a small gray and red wire that starts at the headlight switch with the
&gt; small connector (earlier switches had a larger male connector). Then it
&gt; walks each bulb which is grounded to the back of the instrument panel and I
&gt; can't remember where it ends up exactly after the hazard switch.

If the wiring is intact it could just be a fried dimmer. Pretty common.
