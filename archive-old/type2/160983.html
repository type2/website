&gt;If the aluminum head surface was &quot;pittted&quot; where the two pieces came off,

&gt;surface area holding that valve guide in than those little pieces.

While the valve guide is longer than what's shown in the pictures, if the rebuilder didn't notice those chunks of metal I'd wonder what else was missed. I wouldn't want the valve guide coming loose down the road especially after the warranty ran out.
