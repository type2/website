Subject: [T2] dizzy driving dog offset.

Having turned my distributor into an exploded view of itself I now find the
driving dog ( wierd name for it ) pegs that fit into the driveshaft are
offset. I have consulted manuals but they say to note the offset before
dismantling.........I say no more on this issue !!!
If the notch that holds the rotor is facing the firing/cylinder line on the
edge of the dizzy and I'm looking from above .....is the offset left or
right on the dog/dawg.
Hope this makes sense to anyone who has done this before.
