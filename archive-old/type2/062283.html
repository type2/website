What does the long metal rod that connects the FI (near throttle) to the

It's the EGR pipe, as several others have noted.

If your bus runs fine without it and your EGR valve is not connected to the
throttle by a spring loaded lever arm then that's the reason. Valve is always
closed. You probably won't pass smog without it, unless you live in some 
pristine rural pocket with easy smog laws.

If the linkage is connected, your bus runs fine without it because the little
diffuser pipe inside the air intake manifold is clogged with carbon and/or
rusty crap. Thus no air gets in. If this passage were clear, you could detect a 
drop in rpm when you open the valve by hand at idle. That's how the smog boys
check these things for function. 

You might want to start shopping for the missing parts if you will have to have
it next time you smog test. 

Good luck,
