Well, hate to disagree with Thom but I am near 100% sure as well
it was sealing wax red and chestnut brown.  To back me up on this
if one consults the paint chip page on the KG web page you will see
the manual lists the car types each color is used with, black is
only used on T1's though L53 Sealing Wax red and L73 Chesnut Brown
are listed for a slew of T2's, other T2 colors include the familiar
Dove Blue and quite a few shades of gray.  As I have mentioned before
this page is a real treasure trove of info, but loading the pages is
terribly slow as they are understandably scanned images of the origional
manual.  Plus the benefit of the pages may be somewhat dubious as to
whether or not anyone can mix with whatever were VW standard pigments
from the 50's.  FWIW Chesnut Brown is rather dark.
