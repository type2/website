&gt; Hello List,
&gt; The facts, 6,000 miles on a new Mex longblock.  Changed oil over the 
&gt; weekend
&gt; to 20w50, had the vales adjusted today, mild temps here in cental Ohio 
&gt; this
&gt; evening, not leaking any oil whatsoever.
&gt;
&gt; My oil light came on at idle.  What gives?  What should I check besides 
&gt; the
&gt; oil level?  Too late at the moment, I will do tomorrow.
&gt;
&gt; Is this a warning for low pressure?
&gt;
&gt; Thank you in advance
