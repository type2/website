Subject: Stuck bus...something ain't right

hey now,

just got back from dinner...winds picking up to gusts of 30mph per the radio,
rain sometimes horizontal...guess i don't like driving in this weather but
i gotta get home to amanda if at all possible.

now for my new problem. last night when i left work i let off the parking
brake and started to pull out in first. i didn't go. strong resistance. tried
reverse. same. got out and looked for any curbs that might have grown while
i was at work. none. got back in. put on the parking brake. took it off.
it seemed to disengage. gave it alot of gas...heard a popping sound from
the rear drivers side...i think. i moved forward with no more resistance. i
then put on the parking break. took it off. rolled forward.

tonight it happened again. same parking space. same thing. didn't happen at
my house...didn't happen anywhere else. what could this be? ibm gremlins?
i really don't think it's the parking brake, because even when the brake is
on, you can go forward without the amount of resistance i'm experiencing.
any ideas??
