Subject: Re: Window Removal - Splitte

&gt;time! Anyway, I ramble. What is the best way to drill out the screws and
&gt;then replace them later. I enjoy reading all the rest of the info here!!
&gt;Keeps me sane and looking forward to Lucinda on the road. Thanks all.

There are a couple different ways to attack this.

* Use a very small drill bit, prolly 1 5/64, and drill the center out of the
screw, which will
weaken it enough that the window can be pulled off.  Then use vice grips to
pull the rest of the screw out of the window, or go ahead and drill the
screw out of the window.  If you have acess to a drill press for drilling
the screw out of the window, its the best way to go.

* use a dremel and small stone and grind the head off the screw, and then
remove the shank with vice grips.
