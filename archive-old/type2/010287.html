ello all..
can't seem to find anyone on chat who knows what these things are all 
about..
ok...
I have a 6V gas heater...SW
when I hook it up to juice, the blower for the heat spins...no problems...
but the gas pump blower doesn't...
when I hook up the gas pump to 6V by itself, it works dandy.
but only when hooked up by itself.  my thinking is that it is the little 
resistor or something like that where the heat comes out.  2 red wires 
connect to it and a screw goes through it mounting it to the sheet metal.  
Can I just hook these 2 wires together and all will be fine? or do I need a 
new little ceramic (or whatever it is...its white with a covering on it and 
2 wires soldered on it) part...or can I just hook these 2 wires together?

thanks!
Isaiah
