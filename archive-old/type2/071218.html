Thought someone else would catch this one...
The crankcase breather froze up..and the blow-by? well..It just blew
by..*every* where!...
It was a build up of crankcase pressure due to a clogged breather...
the 2.1 vangons actually have a small heater in the crankcase vent hose to
prevent this..change your oil as it's a sign of water build up....
