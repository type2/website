&gt; I noticed clouds of blue smoke pouring out the tailpipe.  What do you masters
&gt; of German mechanics advise?  A brim full gas tank with stabilizer and good
&gt; shot of oil in each cylinder?  Anything else?

I'd use the full tank and stabil.  Less room for exposed metal to oxidize.  Will
you be able to go out and turn over the engine once a month at least?  Actually
start it and run it for 30 minutes once a month at least.  Keeps things freed
up.

&gt; Any words of advice on narrowing the smoke source,

Does it smoke all of the time?  Look at the plugs.  Some may look wet with gooey
deposits (offending cylinders).  Then compression check.  Oil in the combustion
chamber is usually rings in a VW.  The horizontal position of the valves and
guides at the upper side of the rocker box minimizes oil leakage past the
guides, (no valve stem seals, right?  In upright engines, oil can leak past the
seals and guides running or not due to the vertical orientation of the valve
stems and guides.

Good luck,

Mike D.
