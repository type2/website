Subject: Rust treatment

A couple of weeks ago, 'Tony in NJ' and I exchanged emails on a Benjamin Moore 
rust treatment product.  My local dealer wanted double or triple the price Tony 
was paying... so I chose to try RUST BUSTER, which I found at Tractor Supply 
for ~$18 per gallon.

The instructions for use are pretty sparse, but the label shows a 1-800 number, 
so I phoned.  I said I wanted to paint the surface after treating it.  Nice 
lady said I should let the product dry, then clean off the white haze.

OK... I was working on a roof, so I got the roof good and wet with Rust Buster; 
then went to bed.  In the morning I was mildly horrified to find the roof was 
covered with a black flaky stuff.  But it looked worse than it was, as I found 
when I started in with some Scotch Brite.  The worst areas were indentations 
where there were puddles of black muck.  I first tried wire brushing, but the 
stuff is pretty hard.  Things went much better when I got a bucket of water and 
started working on the semi-dried puddles with moistened steel wool.  The black 
muck came up readily.  Encouraged by this, I did the entire roof with moistened 
Scotch Brite.  Now, at last :-)) I've got the white hazy stuff the lady told me 
about.  

Recommendations: 
(1) don't get the surface dripping-wet with Rust Buster -- apply it with a 
moistened cloth.  If you need more, you can wipe some more on.
(2) don't leave the work for hours at a time -- keep an eye on it (with 
protective eyewear, to be sure) and just re-moisten the areas where the 
chemical reaction seems to need more product.
