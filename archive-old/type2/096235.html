Subject: Re: [T2] Help me find an Oil breather hose

&gt; The day finally came: my oil breather hose is ruined and I'm stuck (luckily

&gt; 3/4&quot; radiator hose.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone provide me a source for 22m or 7/8&quot; hose.

don't know how large a town or city your in but I have had good luck
finding odd size hose at a place that fixes heavy industrial machinery and
trucks and construction equipment.

locally here in Baltimore I go to Langsdale Holtzman they have everything,
fair prices too, although the guy who needs a hyd hose for his fire truck
is likely to get priority over you
