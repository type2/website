Subject: Filler neck replacement
Message-ID: &lt;380CA92B.B9C1AB31_at_jive_dot_net&gt;

I glanced through the archives on this, and just
want to double check my assumptions before
I go tearing into things

The fuel filler neck is accessed by removing
the cover to the gas tank. IS this correct?
 
I have a fairly strong gas smell when I fill
up and corner hard. I assume my filler neck is
gone or cracked. (well, not gone, but malfunctioning)
 
I'm hoping I can get in and fix the thing without dropping
the engine (77 Loaf w/ 2L )
 
I also want to thank everyone for the suggestions for 
my recent trip.  I'd never been through Tennesse before
and found it refreshingly scenic.  I didn't get a chance
to stop and take much in other than watching the landscape
by moonlight...


thanks again

matt
