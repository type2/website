&gt; Will a vacuum advance dizzy cure this problem ( are planning a long trip
&gt;  soon will family in bus and plenty of hills on the way )?
A '71 vacuum distr. has vacuum retard at idle and vacuum advance.  Look up 
the # in your Bentley manual.  It also gives the specs.  What grade fuel are 
you using?  Pinging in an air cooled engine is VERY DANGEROUS!  Don't drive 
your bus if it's pinging or you'll burn a hole in a piston.  What is the 
compression ratio in your engine?  You said it was a 1641.  Did you adjust 
the CR. when you installed the large P&amp;C's?  If you drive your bus when it's 
pinging you WILL regret it.  Fix the problem before it costs you your engine.
