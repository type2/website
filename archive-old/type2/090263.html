Subject: Re: [T2] Make your own pod for luggage rack

Very cool, but I prefer my fiberglass one built specifically 
for the vanagon.

Check out www.vanagon.ORG and click on &quot;Bagawest&quot;.

Thanks,
Chris

&gt;
&gt;Re storage on luggage rack: (I can send pics to the 
dimensionally
&gt;challenged, or ask me for the web site showing this).
&gt;My sig shows the pod I put on my Westy- besides space for 
lots of
&gt;decals, it holds: 1. stock VW tent minus the poles (I hang 
it under the
&gt;awning). 2. 50 ft hank of house extension cord. 3. quickie 
tent (no
&gt;floor) I fasten to awning when bugs are not a problem. 4. 
Folding chair
&gt;(the collapse into a tube shape kind. 5. 10 &quot;waffle block&quot; 
van levelers;
&gt;these interlock to various heights and can be used to get 
out of snow or
&gt;sand. 6. Ground cloth tarp. 7. 1gall. spare gas can. 8. 
water jug
&gt;(minute made 3 qt OJ jug). 9. 4&quot; length of 3&quot; dryer vent, 
aluminum (for
&gt;running bus in place to make power and divering exhaust 
away). 10. flat
&gt;box to hold tent pegs, hammer, rope, spring clamps, etc.
&gt;   The pod is made as follows: the base is made from 
1.5x .75&quot; &quot;  wood
&gt;stock that has plywood paneling stapled to the bottom. It 
forms a
&gt;rectangle that fits into the luggage rack bottom.  You can 
cord it in
&gt;place, but since I had 2 eyebolts sticking up already for a 
spare tire,
&gt;I cut slots in the bottom so the eyebolts poked through; 
using 4x4&quot;
&gt;electrical box covers, I cut slots in them to fit over the 
eyebolts. 
&gt;Wedges go through the eyebolts to keep the box in place. 
With the pod
&gt;locked, no one can pull it away.
&gt;     The pod shape is made by nailing/stapling masonite to 
the box base
&gt;on one side, and then bending it to form a half-round shape 
that is then
&gt;fastened to the other side of the base.  Lay this agains so 
paneling and
&gt;trace the INSIDE shape of the bend with pencil. (If you are 
too big,
&gt;send a kid in to do this).  Cut out 2 doors this way.  
Fasten them with
&gt;piano hinges to the bottom frame.
&gt;At the top, for &quot;stopping&quot; the doors, I traced part of the 
curve onto
&gt;some 2x4 stock and cut it out.  Glue it in place; add 
screws from the
&gt;outside to keep it there.   Get cabinet locks and use these 
to lock the
&gt;end doors.  Paint the masonit throuroughly; remember it is 
made from
&gt;&quot;paper&quot; but as a curved arch, you can sit or stand on the 
box.  My
&gt;milage did not go down with this on top.  It is light 
enough for one
&gt;person to remove it.  For access, stand on the heel arch 
(door open) or
&gt;make a ladder as I did using a boat ladder hung from u 
shapes I bend
&gt;from aluminum stock that is bolted to the bottom of the 
driver side trip
&gt;that matches the sliding door track arch.  A bungee clips 
it to fender.
