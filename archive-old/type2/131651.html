Subject: RE: [T2] Carb ID

That is a four barrel carb. Very similar to a Holley or Eldebrock. Mostly 
used on domestic cars. The manifold for those can be found in any of the Hot 
VW or VW Trends mags. BIG Breather. Gas sucker.

&gt;From: Greg Potts I attended the June Jitterbug VW Show on the weekend and 
&gt;saw a really strange looking carb on the T4 engine that was pushing one of 
&gt;the dune buggies shown. The engine was originally D-Jet FI, but this carb 
&gt;was a strange one, sitting on top of a aluminum box between the frame 
&gt;rails.
