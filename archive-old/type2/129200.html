Subject: [T2] FI Parts ID req'd. - advance and retard

Excuse me for cutting into the thread, but...

Scott said:
&gt; In any case, an injected engine without EGR has no use
&gt; for retarded timing.

Jamie said:
&gt; Why on earth would you want to retard your timing as you open up the 
&gt; throttle?  The *advance* is what comes off of the throttle body on all 
&gt; FI engines that I have seen.

I am rebuilding my California spec. 2.0 1982 engine. It has both vacuum 
and retard 'advance' but I have eliminated the EGR system and plugged 
the ports.

Should I leave off the retard vacuum hose and plug those ports as well? 
  Note that the retard hose comes from a port which draws from the 
engine side edge of the throttle butterfly and the advance line comes 
from a port on the air cleaner side edge of the throttle butterfly. As 
soon as the throttle is cracked I am sure it is the same amount of vacuum.

Should be the appropriate timing specs in this case be different from 
stock?  Thanks,

GG
