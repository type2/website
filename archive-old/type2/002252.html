Subject: overheating, engine fan ducting

I am still trying to eliminate all causes of overheating after going thru
all the obvious.

I have a type IV engine and a proportion of the air from the engine fan
seems to be ducted to the heat exchangers via  flaps in the ducting on the
bottom of the fan housing.

I am considering blocking these flaps so that all the air from the engine
fan goes to cooling the engine and none to the heatexchangers.  If I do this
should I switch on the aux electric fan that blows air through the
heatexchangers to stop them from getting too hot.

Is this idea marginal as far as engine temp and would the extra electical
power needed to power the aux fan put extra load on the engine via the
alternator and cancel out any decrease in temp?

I would be gratefull of anyones thoughts or experiences.
