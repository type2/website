Subject: RE: [T2] OUCH $150 for a mechanical fuel pump, how about  
  electric?!?!?!?!?

Hi, All.
Another consideration; The Facet electric fuel pumps are extremely noisy. I
don't care where you mount them, you'll hear it ticking away unless you go
to extreme measures to mechanically isolate it from the van. I just
installed one on a customer's Mitsub*shi pickup, and I ended up removing it
and fixing the real problem (pushrod had worn down too much). Much more
difficult, but now it's right.
