Hey everybody, I'm re-posting this for a friend I work with:

&gt;Good day all,
&gt; A friend I work with wants a bus BAD.  
&gt;He will be in Vancouver Oct. 16 for about 5 days for the Who concert (lucky bugger) and wants 
&gt;to buy a bus to drive home in.  Home is Northern Alberta.  He wants a non-camperized model for 
&gt;sure and I've schooled him on the merits of all the different years and models of loafs to the best 
&gt;of my ability.  Would be leaning more towards the 76-79 bunch ( he likes the 2.0 litre motor) 
&gt;and a gas heater is pretty much a necessity up here. His price range is roughly $5000 CDN but 
&gt;could scrounge up a bit more if the right one came along. This must be a very good bus, like one 
&gt;he could drive home on short notice without having to spend time working on it down there. So 
&gt;if anyone in Northern Wash., southern B.C. area has one/knows of one/ or sees one in the next 
&gt;3-4 weeks, please let us know.  This will be the fifth fellow Forestry person I will have helped get 
&gt;a VW this summer :)  I must be earning all sorts of karma points. Thanks everyone !

Also, if anyone could provide a source of classified ads for NW US or Southern B.C. it would be 
appreciated.  Please reply direct as I'm no longer subscribed to the list.  TIA.
