Subject: Re: [T2] pre-lubed for easier starting...

The street rodders do this sort of thing...I have heard of some sort of
pressure switch that does not energize the coil until a certain psi is
reached.

If anyone can think of a way to tdo this...bring it on!

&gt; Instead of snake oil, what about a VW FI pump for pre-oiling the engine
prior
&gt; to start up? 30 lbs. pressure, check valve to prevent the oil from
&gt; reversing...
&gt; Wired through the dash, a couple seconds of power and you've got about 30
&gt; PSI oil lubing everything so the engine never has to start &quot;dry&quot;.
&gt;  Plumbing shouldn't be that difficult to fab together...Any thoughts,
Jake?
&gt; Anyone else? Cheaper than Accusump.
