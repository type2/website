&gt;On my '71, while I have the clutch pedal assembly out to replace the clutch
&gt;cable, I decided to clean and grease the clutch pedal shaft. The grease that
&gt;was there was pretty good looking stuff - much thicker looking than the
&gt;general purpose grease that I was going to replace it with. I don't know if it
&gt;was factory grease but it sure did a good job of protecting the shaft - there
&gt;is very little wear after all these years and the grease is still a clean
&gt;golden color. Any recommendations on a good, easily obtainable grease that 
&gt;would
&gt;be applicable here or is general purpose grease OK?

You can forget about what you found in there being original. It was 
serviced with a good
general purpose grease at some time by someone. At any FLAPS you will find 
a shelf with
at least a dozen different brands and types of Gerneral Purpose grease. Pop 
the lid off
them and inspect for something similar in color and consistency to the type 
in there
now that seems to be a very good general purpose grease for this 
application, and
probably for quite a few others as well.
