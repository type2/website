Subject: VDO Oil Temp Guages

OK, now I swear never to besmirch VDO oil temp guages again.  We've known for a while that the problem is grounding.  The problem is that I couldn't get a good one without running a ground wire straight to the sensor.  Then I had no good way of attaching it.  I finally found a solution.  Backed the sensor out about a quarter turn, stripped about an inch off the end of the ground wire, wrapped it around the sensor, and tightened it back down.  Now I get good, stable readings and the light comes on when I turn on the headlights rather than the needle just jumping around like crazy.  And it doesn't leak oil.  

The real problem is that I waited to read the directions until it didn't work.  It said not to use thread sealer as it keeps it from making a good ground.   If you do it right you don't need a separate ground wire.

Drove it around town today in almost 100 degree heat and it only nibbled at 200F!  I know that's pretty close to true as the result of my turkey thermometer experiments.  With the bad ground, it would get way up over 250.  I knew that was wrong.  It also confirms that I have the engine compartment sealed pretty well.  

Moral of the story, read the directions BEFORE you install something.  That's not been my modus operandi in the past, unfortunately.  

I originally had the dipstick sensor but put a new one in the taco plate and it's much better.  One of these days I'll get around to the nice, aircraft-quality quad head temp guage and I'll really know what's happening.  Yeah, one of these days. I'll try to do that before I get to the Suby conversion.  Just kidding.  I'm afraid of being burned at the stake as a heretic.  I heard they're going to start doing that at Everybus next year. (Benthin, are you listening?)   :) 

 Have a great weekend, everyone.  Is it Friday yet?...KR
