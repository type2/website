Subject: Re: [T2] new or used case

The only potential drawback that was mentioned about the Mexican 
cases was the plastic cam plug.
--------------------------
Type IV engines have this cam plug and it works just fine.
There are single and dual relief cases, be sure what you're getting.

&gt; More engine planning.
&gt; 
&gt; I had fully convinced myself that I should use a new Mexican case in 
&gt; 
&gt; the impending motor build. My main concerns about going with a used 
&gt; 
&gt; case are oil pressure problems and failure due to prior overheating 
&gt; 
&gt; of the case.  I have talked to several motor builders that still 
&gt; feel 
&gt; comfortable reusing later model universal cases that have been 
&gt; carefully checked for cracks, warpage or damage. Most approve of 
&gt; boring the case. One of the builders rebuilt the B case in one of my 
&gt; 
&gt; motors 12 years ago and it has held up well.
&gt; 
&gt; The only potential drawback that was mentioned about the Mexican 
&gt; cases was the plastic cam plug.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I am wondering......I want to spend my money right the first 
&gt; time :)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Chris
