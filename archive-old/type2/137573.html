Subject: Re: Adding Warm air to a Weber Progressive

I tried to add an air cleaner from an old mazda to get warm air in with 
mixed success. This air cleaner operates the warm/cold air flap using a wax 
thermostat. At first it worked well, but I discovered that this was because 
there was a leaking manifold boot on the head that the warm air is drawn 
from! Now that head is running at the correct temp. the thermostat doesn't 
get hot enough to function. :((

Far and away the biggest difference to cold weather starting and running I 
have made to my weber progressive was fixing the fast idle. I didn't know 
they had them until I saw a reference in the archive.

Cheers,

Martin Strandgard
