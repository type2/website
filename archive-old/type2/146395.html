Subject: rear quarter panel removal and replacement

I have a '72 bus where the drivers side rear quarter panel (with the
vent) has been caved in (I believe the bus had been tipped over before I
purchased it). Anyway, I have located a replacement but I need to remove
it from the vehicle being parted out. The rear panel appears to be one
piece from the roof line to the wheel well/bumper. Does anyone know how
difficult or time consuming this is going to be to remove? It is held
together with the other panels by screws or welding? Any insight or
advice is very much appreciated.



Thanks,



Chris
