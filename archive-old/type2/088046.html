Subject: fuel pump/FI question of the day

------=_NextPart_000_000C_01C21611.3E365B40
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

On a stock '77 bus, when you turn the key to the first (accessory) =
position, should the fuel pump run indefinitely? At all?
I have come to live with this condition over the years, but I just =
switched intake air sensers(AFM) and now it no longer happens.=20
The old AFM tested out of spec and the pump ran with key in accessory =
position.=20
The new(used) AFM tests in spec as per bentleys terminal tests, but the =
fuel pump does not run.  Can you guys verify that it is correct for the =
fuel pump NOT to run until the starter is turned(Bentley says it gets =
it's first signal from the starter.)
Thanks!
Jay
