Subject: tire size

     I am replacing the tires on my 87 westy.  It has 205/14's on it now.
All my buses have always had 185's on them.  I have read that 205's were put
on some Vanagons.  Is this true?  How would I know which one is correct for
my model.  I am inclined to go back to the 185's.  Any comments?  I am
getting the Yokohama Y356 LT.  I know tires have been hashed &amp; re-hashed
many times.  Sorry if I offend anyone.
