Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Filter

God willing my ASCII don't break, here's the setup that was on the bus 
when I got it, and remains to this day:

                                               tank
fuel pump-                           /
                       \                     /
                         \                 filter
                            \_____/

It makes me nervous the way the plastic filter is just dangling in the 
breeze so close to the neighborhood of the starter. Maybe someone could 
point me to a picture of the &quot;sanctified&quot; way of mounting the filter?

Thanks.

&gt; I don't know the stock location VW put the filter on carbed buses
