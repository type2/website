Subject: need front spare holder and 71 tin
Message-ID: &lt;15510a6a.24be7c8c_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Need a couple of parts.

Front spare tire hanger. The thing looks like a box with two long peices that 
attach below the front bumper. Allows the tire to face out to place the 
hubcap out front. I have one on the 69, need one for the 71. The other style 
will not fit on my new nose.

Front 71 cooling tin. 71 only item with the outlet for the doghouse cooler 
vent. I need a good one as mine is crusty.

Any help?

Will be at the High Country Bus Festival 
(http://members.aol_dot_com/docric/highc.html) to pick up if available.
