Subject: fuel sender location and gas heater troubleshooting..

Greetings all.

It's been a while, as I've taken a bit of a hiatus from working on my bus
(winter in Seattle isn't entirely conducive to working outside) and have
some questions now.  I've got a 71 campmobile with a 1600 dp.

A couple weeks ago, my fuel gauge just quit.  All connections on the back of
the gauge appear to be in good working order and I was planning on testing
the wire to the sending unit to see if it's getting electricity.  However,
I'm not able to find the location where the wire connects to the sending
unit at the gas tank.  Is this something that's accessible without pulling
the tank?  I've looked under the z-bed, above the tranny and can't find any
obvious location for the connection.

Any thoughts?

Secondly, this fall, my BN-4 Eberspacher ceased to heat.  When I pull the on
switch under the driver's seat and turn the timer, the fan kicks on but I'm
not getting any ignition of the gas and hence, no heat.  I'd rather not pull
the heater entirely and was curious if anyone had experienced this problem
before and where I might look for a solution.  I do have some scanned copies
of the manual from the type2 website a while back, but wasn't able to figure
the problem out.

Any more thoughts?

Thirdly, I'm experiencing a bit of carb icing where there wasn't any before.
I've been playing with my choke adjustment and was curious if this could
contribute to the icing problem (staying closed too long, etc..)?  I have a
warming tube that arises from the rear tin to the air cleaner (oil bath) but
I was wondering if carb icing is strictly a function of clogged intake
manifold?

Any more thoughts or are you exhausted by now?

Cheers,

Tom
Seattle
