Subject: Pushrod tube seals

Dear all,

Thanks to all your good advice the van no longer
leaves lovely patterns on the driveway.  It was much
easier than I imagined, the only difficulty was a couple
of rusted screws on the tinware, no plier squashed tubes, 
or heads cracked by flying rods, thanks to you.

Once all the oil was cleaned of the heatexchangers they were 
in a much better condition than I imagined. Does anyone
advocate a permanent oil leak as a form of rustproofing.

Yours gratefully
