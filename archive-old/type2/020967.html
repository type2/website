Subject: RE: [T2] tricks to get a stuck bolt out of a CV?


Another way you might try would be to pound in a 1/4&quot; Standard hex key
into the cap screw.  It's a tad larger that the 6mm, and may give you
enough bite to get it out.  Even more so with a pair of vice grips on
the screw head.  This worked for me last weekend on a stripped cap screw
holding the fuel pump to the case, where there isn't room for a pair of
vice grips....

&gt; 
&gt; It was recommended to me by a mechanic that I should use a cold 
&gt; chisel and a mallet to get the stripped bolt to turn.
