Subject: how check a fuel pump?

Some kind responders have suggested that a leaking diaphram in my fuel pump
might be the cause of all the gas which has accumulated in my engine case.


I pulled the fuel pump from the engine which is now up on my test stand.
It appears to be a replacement unit for it has none of the features shown
in Bentley which would allow it to be disassembled and examined.

Can anyone suggest a way to test the integrity of the diaphram? I've
disassembled much of the engine, so I can't at this time  measure fuel
pressure or cc/min delivery.

Jack
