Subject: Westy/Bus Questions.

HI All,
 I have got 3 questions that I have not found an answer for yet.
- What year did the start putting seatbelts into bays? Including the back
seat &amp; Jump Seat.
- What makes up the floor of a westy? Plywood, etc? has anyone rebuilt the
floor?
- On a 68-73 westy, where do the heater ducts from under the back seat go?

Thanks All,
Matt
