&gt; questions.  I own a 74 automatic and the transmission seem to be getting

&gt; the automatic without too much trouble and too much extra cost.  At this 

sorry but there are some significant differences.

. half shafts are different lengths, so you would need new ones
. shift linkages are very different
. no mounting for clutch peddle
. tranny mounts are different
. different mounting for the shifter
. starter is different (although an auto tranny starter will work in
manual, but not vice versa)

also the auto tranny's change in 76 I think, so they are different too,
not sure if a later auto tranny will fit, but if it does it is a much
better and stronger unit.  also much more avaliable
