&gt; There is a spring that goes across the rocker arm assembly.

&gt; The part that goes to the other side, is it above or below the two bolts.

&gt;
&gt; I think below and I am hoping this is not a &quot;dumb question&quot;.
&gt;

drove me nutsfor the longest time.  the spring fits into the slot in the
keeper blocks for the rocker arm.s and the slot faces down.  so yes it is
under the bolts, all 4 of them, and is held by the slot in the block of
steel that holds the rocker arm assembly..  only takes 6 hands to install
