Subject: Re: [T2] busloops

&gt;From: &quot;Jamey Charlet&quot; I hope to get another Bus to get busloopy on with all
&gt;kinds of stuff, including a toilet!! Go ahead, laugh, it's ok. :-D


I like the toilet idea, how about an oven? Shower? Toilet beats a rusted 
through hole in the floor with a piece of plywood over it.
