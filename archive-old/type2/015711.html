&gt;So what do other type2 operators do to keep their blood temps and 
&gt;pressures down in traffic? Any tips will be appreciated.

I make an effort to accelerate reasonably at stoplights when there are cars
behind me.  This means nearly full throttle till I get to near the posted
speed limit.  

With this method, most people behind me seem to be content, but there are
still a few impatient people that must go quicker.  Usually a teenager in a
POS car or a housewife in a minivan or sport-ute.  I just try to pity them
for having to drive such mundane vehicles, and in extreme cases I think
about how silly they look driving as if they have a fast car, when they
really don't.

Okay, okay, sometimes it will still get to me and I start to think about
engine transplants and nitrous bottles.  :-)
