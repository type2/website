Subject: Re: [T2] Hole in Manifold Boot on '71 Type II

 Hello Nick  First I have never pulled the engine to change these boots it 
can be done in the bus it is a PITA  but not that hard. Temp fix is to move the 
clamps out of the way and wrap electric tape around the boot by rotating the 
boot then reclamp  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
