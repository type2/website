Subject: Re: [T2] Why VW buses die

Well I will agree to that... It is certainly a bigger struggle to cope with 
a recent car.

My CR-V for some unknown reason requires a dash removal just to replace the 
HVAC pollen filter. I made two cuts in the lower dash brace and I can have 
it out in 5 minutes. Made a bracket to cover the cut and added screws.

With some cars like the one your friend mentioned - there are some 
diminishing returns. That's what I like about my cars - simple enough to 
repair and nice enough to be comfortable...

Buddy of mine got a late model Japanese car for free that only needed a
&gt;&quot;little work&quot;...Electronic problems were such that the car was worthless
&gt;without thousands of dollars in labor to rebuild a cooked electrical system.
&gt;A lot of it was spec'd at just getting access to the wiring, etc. There's
&gt;something to be said for old fashioned nuts and bolts and screws that
&gt;come apart as opposed to the snap fittings and one way barbs that hold
&gt;so much modernity together...;-(
