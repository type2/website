Subject: Re: [T2] newbie repairing totaled bus

It also varies by insurance companies in the same city!
Here in Fresno, Calif. one insurance company let me keep my original title,
another had DMV reissue the title with 'salvage' on it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; if you are &quot;buying it back&quot; from the insurance company you will probably
get
&gt; &gt; &gt; a salvage title which might make it harder to sell later........
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Since this is just a financial transaction with the insurance company, you
&gt; &gt; still have the same title you've always had.  The check you get from the
&gt; &gt; insurance company is just smaller since they deducted what they
&gt; &gt; considered the &quot;salvage value&quot; from the total.
&gt;
&gt; George,
&gt;
&gt; This varies tremendously by state!  It is very local and something that
&gt; each individual should inquire about locally.  Some states require a
&gt; salvage (or other name implying really bad prior damage) as a cunsumer
&gt; protection, others do not.  The threshholds vary as well.  If you have a
&gt; bus &quot;totalled&quot; inquire locally before you sign anything!
