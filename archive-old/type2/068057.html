If no one else has jumped on this yet, I'll drive down and lug the thing
back up to Rochester, NY just so it doesn't truck off to the crusher.  SAVE
ALL SPLITTIES!

&gt; 
&gt; Well folks, I just picked up a '67 Sundial camper for parts. Runs &amp;
drives for
&gt; 150 bucks. The interior isn't in the greatest shape, then again it's a
Sundial
&gt; conversion, so it looked rather cheezy from the get go. I was wondering
if there
&gt; was anyone out there that has a Sundial that could use some interior
parts. So
&gt; the interior is free to the first person who picks it up. Otherwise it
gets
&gt; crushed with the rest of the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm in Allentown Pa.
