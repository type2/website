&gt; Not necessarily.  The Cat does lower CO but it's main function is to lower
&gt; NOx.  Most IM tests (unless you're on a dyno don't test for NOx)
&gt;

I will disagree here, though I could be wrong.  The primary NOx reducer in
the emissions control system is the EGR.  Since NOx occurs at very high
combustion chamber temps, the EGR has the effect of lowering combustion
chamber temps and therefore lowering NOx.  I believe that the primary
function of the catalytic converter is to lower unburned HC emissions, as
the cat takes unburned fuel in the exhaust and burns it in the converter,
for lack of a better term.  This has the effect of lowering HC (hydrocarbon)
emissions and probably also has a similar effect on CO emissions since CO
(carbon monoxide) is the product of incomplete combustion.  George can
probably expound on that :-)

&gt; It doesn't sound like the cat to me.  More than likely its the O2 sensor.

Be advised that if this '82 Westy is a Federal (49-state) model, it DOES NOT
have an oxygen sensor.  Only the California emissions air-cooled vans had
oxygen sensors.

Please correct me if I have made a factual mistake as I like understanding
this stuff too!
