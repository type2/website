&gt; I think I have covered all that I have tested so far.  Did I miss something?

You have spark, but have you double checked that your plug wires all
go the correct plug? Take it all back to scratch &amp; double check. Start
by making sure the engine is at TDC for #1. Confirm that the rotor
button points toward the little notch on the distributor. It's a pain
to see, but you need to find it just in case. Then clockwise from #1
the plugs should go to #1-#4-#3-#2. Double check this just to make
sure you aren't missing something silly.
