Subject: Sliding Door Channel Cover Beading

When I took the covers off the Guac to derustify them, the beading was
folded in half between the cover and the bus. Is it supposed to be that way?
Or does the beading go on either side of the channel's lip?

Channel lip= |
Beading= ::

It came like this: |::
Should it be like this: :|:
