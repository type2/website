Subject: RE: [T2] Stripped plug hole in the UK

JB Weld is amazing stuff, but my guess is that i wouldn't expect it to hold
up under compression and combustion loads for long. Best solution is a new
head, followed by a professionaly installed insert, lastly a helicoil. A
helicoil might hold up for a long time or maybe not. Coil would probably get
you through your trip.

Cheers,

Hi all
I'm in need of some urgent help here in the UK. I've just been servicing my
1978 1600dp in readiness for our trip up to Scotland from Bristol next week
and with only a few days to go I have stripped a spark plug hole.  If
possible I will try to find someone locally to fit a helicoil but if not is
there anything else I could do to temporarily fix this. Is it possible to
temporarily JB Weld the plug back in. it only has to last another 1500-200
