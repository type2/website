&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;   I know we are going into summer but I'm trying to plan ahead here.  My 
&gt;rear window defroster grid is shot &gt;   I'm wondering if anyone has ever &quot;glued&quot; some kind of fine wire to the 
&gt;rear window to make your own defroster.  

Paul:

Materials needed:
Nickel Chromium wire, 30 AWG
2-Ton epoxy
Duct tape
De-greaser
Glass cleaner
Rear glass out of the vehicle
New rear glass rubber

OK, you asked for it.  First, you have to use Nickel-Chromium wire, most commonly known as Ni-chrome.  Use a small guage, about 30AWG.  If you use anything bigger, it's harder to handle and sometimes won't stay flat against the window.  You can't use regular copper wire, because the resistance is too low.  Ni-chrome has a higher resistance, and will generate heat as the electrons flow through it.  Copper wire will act like a short circuit, and will only blow fuses.  

Next, cut the ni-chrome to length.  Since this wire doesn't solder well, it's best to use one continuous piece.  I start one end at one of the connecting lugs, making sure to leave a couple extra inches of wire, then go back and forth, following the original lines of the defroster, and end up at the other connecting lug.  I've seen some people get creative with this process, however, and do things like make pictures or slogans out of the wire-laying procedure.  To each his own.  After you've laid out the wire, place it in a safe place, because the most important part of the job is to make sure your glass is absolutely clean.  I usually use some kind of glass polish, which has very fine abrasive particles in it, followed by 3M de-greaser, then Windex.  DO NOT touch the glass after you've cleaned it.  Wear gloves or use paper towels to handle the glass.  
After the glass is clean, you'll need a 2-part epoxy to glue the wire to the glass.  I usually use a product called 2-ton epoxy, which can be found in most hardware stores. It has a long work time, a couple of hours, so you don't have to rush. Any good 2-part clear epoxy should work, just make sure it can glue glass.  It should say on the package if it'll work on glass.  Also, make sure it has a work time of at least a couple of hours. 

Next, clean the wire you laid out earlier with the de-greaser and a paper towel.  You can't have finger oils on the wire.  Mix the epoxy, then spread as little as possible on the wire.  I put just enough epoxy on it so it looks like a film on the wire.  Don't use too much, beause it will only squeeze out away from the wire on the glass, and look ugly.  It's a lot easier to work in small sections, so don't coat the whole length of wire.  Do one section at a time.  After you've coated one length of the wire, place it where you want it on the glass, then tape down each end with a small piece of duct tape.  It's good to have a helper at this point, because each of you can hold one end of the wire tight across the glass, while taping your end down.  Next, place a small piece of duct tape on the glued wire every 6 inches or so, then take one long piece, and tape the whole section of the wire to the glass, pressing down so the wire gets glued as close as possible to the glass.  Follow this procedure for the rest of the wire, then let sit for 24 hours.  If you get some epoxy on the glass, you can wipe it up before it dries, or wait until it dries and scrape it off with a razor blade.  Carefully remove the duct tape, pulling slowly in the direction the wire runs.  Place the lug connectors onto the lugs on the glass, making sure the ni-chrome wire gets pinched inside the connectors.

Where do you find 30 guage Ni-chrome?? Start at appliance repair shops, since ni-chrome is used in electric dryer heating elements.  If they don't have 30 AWG, they can probably tell you where to get it.

Hope this helps.  It's not as hard as it might seem.
