          Huh, well I've seen the inside of the fan housing more times
than I wanted to, but your arguement is convincing, Sean. Especially
since it doesn't make sense that they would design it to force air thru
the oil cooler when the engine is cold. But that is what it looked like
it was doing to me. And also since my oil temps in really cold weather
are lower than it seems they should be.
           So I guess before next Winter, I'll try sticking a new
thermostat and cable on. But I'll wait until cold weather, not much
point in doing it now. 8-)
      With watercooled engines I always put in the hotest temp
thermostat that you can use, as the higher temps improve efficiency, but
aircooled usually run too hot. One thing that is a mystery to me is why
there isn't more heat transfer from the cyl/heads to the crankcase.
