Finally, after three years of off and on rust repair, I finally realized that
the first work I had done needed to be redone.  I took a week of my vacation
time, worked like a trooper and called it quits.  Not wanting a perfect
restoration (I did that once and was afraid to drive my car for fear of being
dinged) but a daily driver that looked presentable I went to Maaco and had
them paint &quot;Sunbeam&quot; bright yellow.  Today, my birthday, I picked her up and
she is truly a sunbeam.  Can't sneak up on anyone now.  They painted the
inside of the doors and all the metal inside, painted the engine compartment
black and the muffler and tail pipe with aluminum paint.  The old girls looks
great from five feet away.  I missed four or five small dents, but I finally
decided that I was driving a huge bumper and would probably never get
everything flat.  All in all, I am pleasantly surprised at the work Maaco did.
They told me they used two gallons of paint.  Painted her twice.  I guess
talking with the owner, who restores muscle cars, didn't hurt.  Now to get the
bits and pieces put back on and I can drive instead of doing body work for
awhile and devote my time to the interior.
