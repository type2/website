Volks-  '74 Westy, 1800 engine, 70 amp alternator.
In the span of about three days, my alternator light started flickering
randomly, then went to glowing ONLY when I was turning left and then off
again and finally it glowed all the time. I bought my voltage regulator
at AutoZone, and had it tested there. It was bad, so I got a new one and
installed it. The light still glowed. I tested my alternator according to
the type 2 library instructions and found out that it was bad, too. I got
a new alternator and installed it. 
My alternator light STILL GLOWS. 
I checked the wiring connections again and again and found nothing.  I am
SUPPOSED to leave tomorrow night and drive 14 hours through the night
with my wife and infant son. Unless I fix my alternator, I'm not going
anywhere. Please help me before I pull out ALL of my hair. 
TIA
Joel Sell
