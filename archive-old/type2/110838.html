&gt; was wondering what you guys would recommend as the top ten list of
&gt; things to check out and make sure are in working order for an old
&gt; bus like this.

well it would be &lt;brakes&gt; hard to say exactly what an important
&lt;brake&gt; item would be. I mean all &lt;brakes&gt; things are important for a
bus run &lt;brakes&gt; proper &amp; stop correctly. Oh yea, I'd look at the
brakes first. :)

I would also recommend for him to purchase a bentley for his bus if he
doesn't already have one. This book will answer most of the questions
he has about keeping it on the road.
