I have a 2/50 air conditioner  (both windows open at 50mph)

it does take some power the condition and load probably determines how
much there have been quite a few discussions about how much 
&gt; 
&gt; directly (by welding the pulleys together) or by attaching a small V-belt to
&gt; them? Would the alternator be able to supply enough electricity to the
&gt; compressor as well? 

the simple answer is &quot;no&quot; noway is that alternator going to do it not to
mention the same load (plus energy conversion loss) would be required from
the alternator.

the best solution I think would be one of the newer rotary compressors
that several vendors sell, check depth of pocketbook first
