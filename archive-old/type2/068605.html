&gt;  I'm asking if there are sensors for this purpose that might be adapted.
&gt;       On the Dehavilland Dash 8 aircraft i work on there are what is called fire loops which encircle the engine nacelle &amp; wheel well.
Only one is required , the other is a backup.
These wires are hollow and filled with a gas (not sure what).
When a fire starts the gas expands and trggers a pressure switch putting
on numerous lights on the fire detection panel.
   The cost of this system would be prohibitive to use on your bus.
How about a home smoke alarm rigged to an alarm inside? Any other
suggestions?
