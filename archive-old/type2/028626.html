Hello list!

Subject: &quot;Collective Bargaining&quot;

I belong to a..... yes.. yes.. a WATER COOLed club
here in Chicago
and just noticed that after paying full price for
two new VW batteries
that CVO members get 10 and 15% off many VW parts
at many VW
local vendors.

Question:
Since replacement parts for our AIR COOLed
brethrens are in
great demand why don't we have a Type2 Members
only section
that incentifies members to join(at a cost) and
get a discount at
listed and specialty selected VW vendors on the
type2_dot_com site.

This would enhance the stickiness/traffic/revenue
generating
activities of the type2 site and therefore better
serve our users.

I am sure that Ron would appreciate a section that
can drive
quantitative traffic to his site.
