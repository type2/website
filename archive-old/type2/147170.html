Subject: Re: [T2] Empi style 5 spokes for the Bays??

True Dave, but I've got a thing about 5 spokes! :-) I don't know who is
making them for the European market, but they MUST be available here
somewhere. If you look closely the only diff, is they drilled the holes for
the 112 pattern and not the big 5 pattern. I guess I could do that, but it
would look ugly with the extra holes.

CIP_dot_com also sells some Fuch's in the 5-112 bolt pattern. Remember also

that some Jetta's, Passat's and Mercedes use that same pattern.
