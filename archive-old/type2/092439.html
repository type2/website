Subject: re Roof Racks

Hey Everone,
I work at a roof rack store if you need racks I can hook you up at a good price and free shipping even the bars.  I have put lots of racks on vanagons bays and even a few Euro Vans, thule yakima or constuction style.  If you have any questions give me a call or check the site.
Thanks
Kevin
