Subject: ISO gas filler hose

Ok everyone.  I do not know if they are the same as early bays but....

I am in search of a new hose to go from the tank to the filler for a 71
Single Cab.  This hose is just under 3 inches wide and 7 inches long.  Any
ideas where I might pick something like this up?

Peace Brothers and SIsters,
Snoopy
