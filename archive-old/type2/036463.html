Intake manifold to cylinder head: 14 ft-lbs. per Bentley at the back of the
Engine section in the &quot;Tightening Torques&quot; section.

&gt;&gt; Hi folks--
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I want to check whether my intake manifold has a leak 
&gt;&gt; at the heads after 6 months of break-in.  Does anyone 
&gt;&gt; know what the proper torque for those nuts would be?
