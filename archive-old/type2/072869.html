Subject: unwanted beeps - NOT a bad horn wire!
Message-Id: &lt;v02130500b41fcc51ddc5_at_[209.245.213.40]&gt;

The 70 still has an annoying problem with unwanted horn-honking; the horn
wire has been replaced, and the straw trick has been performed!
Problem seems worse when making a LEFT turn; horn will honk intermittently
in time with turn signals during a left turn, tho it rarely does this when
turning right (right turns seem to be an occaisional -meeep- regardless of
blinkers).
Do I need to replac that little bushing at the bottom of the steering tube?
How about the one at the top, under the nut?

It sounds like there is some interaction between the turnsignal switch and
the horn, but I can't picture how this would be so.... any hints?
