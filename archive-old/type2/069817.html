Hex head bolts sound like a GOOD idea.

Having lots of difficulties in getting this engine out and stripped because
of things like rust, stripped screws, and other things that just slow me
down.  Very frustrating.  But I like learning more about how it all works.
It's really not just magic!  :-)

I have my engine out right now and am hoping to have it back in within the
next week.  I blew a spark plug out of the # 3 cylinder, and figured I would
get as many things cleaned up while I had it out.  some of these things may
help you.

I took all metal parts and cooling tin (lots of rust) and cleaned all grease
off of them.  I then used POR-15, a rust preventative paint that you paint
over the rust with, and from what I've heard from other people, really works.
 Then I painted them black with Hi-Temp paint and they really look a lot
better.  It will be much easier next time I need to do this.  I found out
halfway through this that my neighbor started a business powder coating (a
way of painting, I'll explain ifyou dont know, I didnt) and if  I were doing
it again, I would have them all Powder coated.  The stuff I did have done
looks great, and I mean really great, and this stuff is so incredibly
durable, it's amazing.

I also had a problem with the cyl. head temp sensor.  It is a bolt, and it
stripped out of the head while I was removing it.  I used an epoxy thread
rebuilder (a heli-coil was $60, and I just couldnt justify it for something
with no load on it) and I hope it holds.  Check catalog prices for
availability and economics before you ruin or throw out annything.  Prices,
where available, can be high.

You may want to check the fuel tank and lines.  It is worth it to replace all
the rubber, including the little lines going to the injectors (A lot of
pressure in that system).  I put in new metal lines and all new rubber.  I
also removed gas tank and derusted it and used a sealing compound to seal
it--it's worth the extraq time to do this while the engine is out, because
it's the only time you can get to it.  

I'm also going thru and sanding any rust down in the engine compartment (not
too much, but  a good deal under the gas tank) and repainting with por-15 and
then repainting the whole thing.  It just gives me peace of mind.

Lastly, Im installing lights and a fuse block with a switch back there.  It's
only a couple hours of work, and it really helps on a dark lonely highway.

Hope this helps you, and happy to hear your making progress.  I'll be happy
to give any help I can. 

Ned

PS May be down in NJ this fall, let you know if I do.  Hoboken &amp; Morristown.
