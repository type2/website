&gt;When I took the CV off there was a cupped washer in the boot kit which was
&gt;to fit between the end of the drive shaft and the joint and the kit said to
&gt;replace this on CV's where it was required. I tried it and this took all the
&gt;play out, but decided that since there hadn't been one previously fitted and
&gt;the joint hasn't given any trouble, only the rubber boot had split, to leave
&gt;it off.

&gt;Anybody else want to comment on this?-------

Regarding various comments on side to side play on CV joints, this was my
post above some time back.

I just noticed in Haynes that it mentions that an instruction went out
sometime from VW to the dealers telling them to leave off the concave washer
when renewing the joint. So if your CV is original its quite likely there
will be little side to side play, but if it's like mine you'll be able to
move them side to side about 1/4 inch. It runs fine.
