&gt;I was merely making the point that Volkswagen distributors when found in

A used vacuum advance distributor is no worse than a used centrifugal 
advance distribitor.  With either of them you want to disassemble them, 
clean them, re-shim the dog gear, and grease the advance plate.  With 
The vacuum advance you have an extra step of testing the vacuum cannister.  
All the &quot;failed&quot; vacuum advance distributors I have ever owned did not 
advance were due to a gummed up advance plate, not a bad vacuum diaphram.

I do use 009 distributors on dual carb engines with no vacuum lines.  
But I DON'T use new Brazilian ones.  I find used German ones at swap meets 
&amp; rebuild them.

&gt;Your vacuum advance stops working and you blow the motor, all because 
&gt;you want to have blind faith in VW's stock distributor. I advise YOU to 
&gt;read Muir on the why centrifigal advance is more reliable than vacum.  

I don't put blind faith in anyone, including some stoned &quot;guru&quot; who told 
&quot;compleat idiots&quot; how to keep their bugs running in the late '60s.  I am 
my own mechanic and I trust what I have learned from MY experiences and 
sense of reasoning.

Come drive one of my buses that has a stock engine, stock distributor and 
stock carb that has smooth throttle response throughout the rpm ranges and 
then tell me why having to pump gas while shifting gears is a better 
solution.

Ol' John might have been ok for the times, but his advice has NOT stood 
the test of time.  He gave advice on how to keep things running if you 
didn't have the &quot;bread&quot; to have it fixed properly.  He was not giving 
advice to keep things running for an additional 30 years.
