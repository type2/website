Subject: [T2] 79 Child Cot poles wanted

Hi Volks,

I'm in need of a set of child cot poles for my 79 westy conversion.. You
know the ones that have one pole which can be extended to fit the wider
distance between the rear pillars.

Shipping is probably too expensive if you aren't in S. Ontario, but if
you're coming to EveryBus I can meet you there. I'll even pay up-front to
hold them until after Easter, so you can take advantage of the 19 shopping
days left before Christmas.

Reply off-list, thanks.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
