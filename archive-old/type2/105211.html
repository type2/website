Subject: Re: [T2] Bay windshield installation

&gt;So aht exactly is the complaint about anyway?

Silicone will screw up paint terribly (newly sprayed paint over silicone) 
but I figure if I'm years from the next paint job I'll be just fine. Plus 
I'm sure with enough cleaning it will all come off. I expect with age and 
washing and weathering the silicone will come off.

Silicone I THINK leads to fisheyes which are like tiny points where the 
paint is repelled in a circle around the impurity on the body surface. 
Looks like an eye, maybe even one of a fish.

Maybe a paint pro like Terry K. would/could comment here and clue us in.

Well I guess it does lead to fisheyes.

Does it lead to fisheyes 5 years down the road? (example time period 
between paint jobs)
