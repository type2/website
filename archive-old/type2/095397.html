Subject: Re: [T2] 71 Dormobile how rare???

Hi Paul


&gt;   No, I haven't found one, but what I have is the stove and sink &gt;combo 
&gt;the full width of the bus. SO-69.
Thats a little different to what i thought you had, shipping something like 
that could be a problem :)

&gt;While I have you could you check one thing for me over there? The &gt;land 
&gt;rover dormobile pop tops are they the same window seals and vent &gt;seals? I 
&gt;really could use new replacements, and having a little &gt;difficulty locating 
&gt;seals in the States.
I dont know if the landrover seals are the same but JK do some reproduction 
seals for the dormobile roof

try
http://www.justkampers.co_dot_uk
direct link to search page for parts is
http://195.82.114.192/FMPro?-db=Orders.FP5&amp;-format=search.htm&amp;-new

A search under dormobile should give you three results, one for a skylight 
and 2 for seals on the roof.

DORMOBILE SKYLIGHT SEAL £14.95
DORMOBILE ROOF WINDOW SEAL &amp; INSERT £4.50

Im unsure if these parts are available elsewhere or if they are a part that 
have been reproduced exclusivley for JK.

Ive used JK before without problem, im unsure if they will ship to the 
states (ill help if they wont) but im sure they will be very willing to 
answer any questions you may have regarding the size of the seals via email 
(mail_at_justkampers.co_dot_uk)

Hope that helps
Michael
