&lt;&lt; Tony,

Ummmm...didn't know it came in natural or synthetic.. !

All I can remember is that it is &quot;sterile&quot; and was labeled
with a &quot;medical&quot; reference.  Otherwise just a standard 4-6 oz bottle with 
the manufacurers label on it.
 &gt;&gt;

I've an empty &quot;glycerine&quot; bottle from an organic friend and checked it
against the &quot;glycerine&quot; sold at the local pharmacy...I was just curious
if there was a difference in the effect it has on the bus seals...I've
read in a few other books on the uses of glycerine for lubricating
and preserving rubber, but the books were quite old and (I assume)
the glycerine referred to was the vegetable by-product and the
rubber, another natural product not the man-made rubber in use
today...
Anybody with an older British car will remember the results of using
&quot;American&quot; brake fluid in their British Iron...Older brake systems used
natural rubber seals that the American fluid would eventually soften
to the point of failure...&quot;Girling is not a gerund...&quot;
