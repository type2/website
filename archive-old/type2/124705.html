Subject: Re: [T2] Happy Dance in Progress

Oooops....TYPO. After the black wire on 15 leaves the coil, it goes LEFT, not 'to the right'.

 

&gt; You will see the coil pictured. Go straight up to N. See the little 15? See the black
 wire going to the right? See it go to S21? THAT is the in-line fuse for the backup lights. From there
 the black wire goes up and to the right and ends at the double relay.
