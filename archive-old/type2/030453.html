See... ya go away for twenty four hours and when you get back, you need to
go out and buy a wheelbarrow to carry your swelled head in :-)  

I am unsure about how to respond.  Certainly a grateful &quot;You're welcome&quot;,
but also I must say that many of the posters forgot, somehow, to mention
that this is a two way street.  John told of me helping with Pat's engine,
but forgot to mention many cold weekends when he drove in from West
Virginia to help me install multiple engines, and to help Sean, and many
others.  Charlie told of staying with me as if it had been entirely to his
benefit, when in fact I drew as much or more support for him as he did
from me, not to mention that he has been the soul and conscience of this
list again and again. Oh, and Ken...  who only devoted 2 years of his life
to the list (more than I have lasted :-) and is again stepping into the
breech.

And then there are the others...  Karl Von Saltzen, who keeps sending
parts that keep our buses alive, Al Brase with cogent advice...(I got over
10 names and did a fairy massive cut down here :-) and so many others...
some here, some gone to other lists (hey, can we somehow convince Unka
Joel and Clara that they *need* bay window buses???)

I feel very blessed to be able to associate with a group of such people.
Thank you all for the ride!
