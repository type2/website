Subject: E-Brake Adjustment Preliminary Question

I am planning on adjusting my brakes  once and for all this weekend (for at
least this go around).

Now I know that the threaded portion of my e-brake cables is about 3 or 4
inches long, and the cable is flowing nicely (as I just lubed them up).

My question is, do the cables tend to stretch over time which? It would
explain why I need to thread the nut so far down the shaft for the brake to
even remotely catch.

The advice I got before on my brake issues was priceless, I am just still
getting out of the woods with the parking brake part.

Mahalo,

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
