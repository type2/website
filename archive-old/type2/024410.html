Subject: Engine advice -69 bus
Message-ID: &lt;80811524.246f1f25_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Been lurking on this list for awhile and need some help and some things 
clarified.  I have a 69 passenger bus, very good shape body wise ( for a 30 
year old vehicle ! ).  It runs now, but I know she's sick....I want to 
replace the engine and transmission, but confusion reigns.....

How can I tell what type of engine is in this bus ?
I'd like to replace the engine, I don't mind going slow ( it does about 65 
now, but I usually cruise _at_ 60 mph ).  What is the best engine I can put in 
without requiring any cutting or modifying of the engine compartment.  

I am also planning on replacing my transmission, will this effect my engine 
replacement ?  What else should I replace while I have it apart, I am 
planning on replacing / cleaning gas tank, filler neck and electrical while 
in there.

I have visited aircooled_dot_net ( I couldn't find any engines on the website, so 
it was worthless, maybe its under development )  I visited beetlemex but they 
aren't helping me with my choices...any other resources I should know of ?

I have a budget of about 2500 and plan on doing all labor myself and with 
&quot;beer&quot; helpers, please advise...
