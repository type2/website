Subject: Re: [T2] Re burnt auto trans and new bus

When they call me I will ask them about options. Best to have the best 
possible if
I am going to pay for it. He mentioned something about them needing a set of 
seals
at times.. He was general, talking to a newbie in this so Im not sure what 
he was
meaning exactly.

I'll let you know.. he said this afternoon it should be out and looked at.

personally I wouldn't spend any where near that much on a 003 auto tranny
rather I would use the money to find a late 010 auto tranny from a 76+ bus
and put it in, and pay to fix it up. the 010 is a much tougher and easier
to fix auto tranny.
