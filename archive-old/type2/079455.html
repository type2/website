&lt;&lt; Is it similar to the early, early Fords which circulated water based on 
the 
density or temperature of the water?

Been a long time since I read something about that.


&gt;West Marine Catalog has dozens of 12v water pumps I am sure the right one
&gt;could be found.....also if done right it could even be gravity feed, I
&gt;have gravity circulated hot water heat in my house...no pumps at all
 &gt;&gt;

Thermosiphon's the name of the system...Pretty simple, really; hot water's
lighter and rises in the pipes, cools in the radiators and falls back down to
the boiler to be reheated. Lots of old houses used the system (saves on 
parts), but usually a little tricky in the initial set-up to get a &quot;balanced&quot;
system. Old cars, same effect...Hot water flows up the pipe to the rad-
iator, replaced by cooler water from the bottom of the radiator.
Gravity feed hot air systems in old houses - same principle (but it works
better with a nice steady coal-fired furnace ;-)
