Subject: Re: [T2] Installing Electronic Ignition--newbie info

Thanks for the newbie info Rik, but if you were paying attention to the list 
for any time at all you would have noticed that I have been an active list 
member for almost a year and a half and have accomplished major repairs 
including dropping my engine twice, replacing heads and a brake servero.

I hardley think installing an electronic ignition is a newbie question.

But hey thanks for the info!!!
