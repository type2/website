Subject: [Fwd: Re: [T2] Push Rod Seals]

-------- Original Message --------
You may also want to put some Permatex gasket sealer (H3-or is it 3H?)
around each seal. Read this in Tom Wilsons book, did mine that way 2
years ago and never leaked a drop.

!!!!!CONTRAINDICATION ALERT!!!!!

You will SO regret that the NEXT time you have to replace them.
Cleaning sealer out of those grooves is no fun.  As Richard says, a li'l
bit of clean oil on all the surfaces and make sure they go in even with
no pinching.

Now, where did I put that writeup I did on this?
