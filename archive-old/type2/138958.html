&gt; Anyway, when I pulled the distributor out I found more strangeness.
&gt; First, the it does not appear to be original, though the PO said it
&gt; was.

POs: is there's anything they won't lie about?

&gt; It has a single vacuum hose attachment and the following part
&gt; numbers:
&gt; 
&gt; VW 043 905 205
&gt; Bosch 0 231 170 084 (the 8 might be a 3)
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?

043 means beetle and the Bosch number probably ends in 034. It's from a 74
bettle with M/T:

&gt; Secind, I'd been using a crude little notch in the normal place
&gt; (pointing at the fan) to make sure timing was in the neighborhood, and
&gt; that's where #1 wire is.  But, the actual notch is 180 degrees away, by
&gt; #3 plug wire!  I assume the PO got something in backwards with the
&gt; distributor drive.  Does this make any difference in practice?

Not for your timing light but it may confuse you when adjusting the valves.

#1 and #3 are 180 degrees apart on the distributor which means they are 360
degrees apart on the pulley and therefore show the same pulley notch when
the light flashes.

&gt; That 
&gt; is, do I still time by aiming the rotor at #1 plug wire position, then
&gt; use the timing scale as usual on the fan housing?  I can't quite think
&gt; this through after a long day peering through the hatch...

Yes, it won't matter unless #3 is retarded. You can check this easily by
using the timing light on #1 and #3 and seeing if there is any difference in
the reading.

I can't remember when beetle distributors stopped building retard into #3
but my guess is long before the 74 beetle dizzy you have.

&gt; Also, with regard to timing lights, is there a useful difference
&gt; between the $30 off-brand and the $50 Craftsman?

The craftsman light seems build to last. Buy on a weekend when when you can
apply a $10 off coupon. Sears is always having sales. Sign up for a Sears
card and get $10 off, etc.

&gt; How 'bout the 
&gt; tach/dwell meters?

$15 Sunpro CP7676 from eBay. Get this style only:

&gt; Sheesh, this gauge install's getting expensive!

You'll need all that stuff over time anyway.
