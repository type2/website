&gt; &gt;[...] Anyone know where to find parts and/or tools for swedging?  I have to
&gt; &gt;make up some sunroof cables for a Type 3 Ghia using Porsche cables and need
&gt; &gt;to take the end off and reattach it.
&gt; 
&gt; Well not to get into it, but cable ends are just good ole crimped.
&gt; What you want to find is an industrial type hand held crimper, looks
&gt; like a set of cable cutters with 2.5' handles but has interchangeable
&gt; dies.  Used to make up aircraft cable style assemblies and commonly
&gt; for crimping large electrical connectors.  A good set can cost about
&gt; $300+ with only one type of die though.  Now there are also cheaper

When I need the big boys I go to my local heavy equipment rental place and
rent a set of hydralic ones for less than $50 for the day, usually make
sure I have all the things that I need em for handy so it becomes
basically a production run
