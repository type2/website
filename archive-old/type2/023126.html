I know everyone swears by this stuff (POR-15)...anyway, I want to undercoat 
the bottom of my bus.  So, I have a few questions:

1. How much will I need?
2. I know that once you open a container, it is only good for so long...how 
long?
3. What should I coat, and
4. What should I NOT coat?
5. I know the container explains working/curing temps, but has anyone found 
anything different?

It appears that the original owner, paid to have the dealer(?) undercoating 
put on...now it is flaking off.  I know this will be time consuming, but I 
believe it will be well worth it.

On the same line of questioning...how much of the &quot;whitecoat&quot; POR-15 take 
to do the poptop and luggage rack?

Thanks everyone!

Missy:)

p.s.  I finally got the fuel/air mixture correct and drove my new baby 
around town Friday night (with expired tags...I might add.)  I was testing 
out the throttle when....ooops...I broke the hinge off of the accelerator 
peddle.  Funny, eh?
