Subject: Re: [T2] Endplay in new and worn engines-crank &quot;windup&quot;?

One thing that happens is the thrust bearing wears as
the engines gets older.  You claim you saw the thrust
bearing move, but you did not say in which direction. 
If it rotates, that is plain bad and you will be in
serious trouble in the near future.  If it moves back
and forth as you check the endplay, it indicates that
either the &quot;thrust&quot; walls of the bearing or the case
are wearing.  In this scenario, adjusting the endplay
only adjusts the play between the crank/flywheel and
the bearing.  But the bearing still moves.  While this
is not a good scenario, it is better than rotation.  

There is a mid-term solution to this problem.  Have
someone push on the crank pulley, and using a large
punch, punch the bearing thrust walls against the
case, all the way around the bearing.  Like I said,
this is not a long term solution, but if your engine
is healthy otherwise, it will keep you going.

&gt; 
&gt; Re end play, when I did the clutch replacement on my
&gt; high milage engine
&gt; (220,000 at the time, no rebuild, now 236,000 but
&gt; oil pressure can be 18
&gt; when hot (230deg) at 55 mph- goes higher with rpm
&gt; increase.  Idle
&gt; pressure is still good (about 5, can make higher set
&gt; VDO gauge flicker
&gt; when oil is 240).   I found the endplay to be at the
&gt; upper limit (can't
&gt; recall now, about .008?) I put in the right
&gt; combination of shims, but
&gt; the end play went to zip when the engine was wound
&gt; up in the rotation
&gt; direction, so I put in narrower shims to get me to a
&gt; wound up
&gt; measurement around .004.  So how does the rotation
&gt; position affect the
&gt; endplay in a 1. new engine, and 2. old engine?  I
&gt; did see movement (in
&gt; out) in the thrust bearing and thought this was
&gt; related.
