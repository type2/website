Subject: Re: [T2] Chrome Locking Gas Caps are Back!

I got one too, although mine seems very snug and couldn't wiggle it off. Is
the rubber gasket on?

&gt;   I got one of these from Ron and it is nice looking etc. BUT while the
&gt; cam comes out like it is supposed to, with a little wiggling I can still
&gt; get the gas cap off in the locked position.
&gt;
&gt; This is NOT critical of Bus Depot, I got the order in less time than was
&gt; promised and everything was there, the gas cap was exactly as Ron
&gt; advertised, it just doesn't lock the cap on.
