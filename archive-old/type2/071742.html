Hiya Steve,

Yep, that's exactly what it is - and accelerator pedal stop.  I've got one as 
big as life on my 70 Bus.  And by the way, if yours is in good shape and you 
want to peddle it (sorry about that!) I'm your guy.  Mine is a little busted 
up and just managing to hang in there right now.

Mike
