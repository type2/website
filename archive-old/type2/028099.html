Now that the lovely desert temperatures are approaching 110 degrees, I'm beginning to notice a pretty large difference between the readings of the cyl head and oil temp on my 82 aircooled westy.  The oil sensor is sump-mounted.  My cyl head temp never goes above 225, but hte oil temp gauge sometimes will read at close to 280.  I have a feeling that it may not be wired correctly, as it tends to fluxuate with the dimmer switch for headlights, but i still think it is running a bit hot.  The van has an aftermarket a/c from PO, which I have not used as I haven't been able to locate the dumb little belt for it.  Will the cutout on the tin for the compressor cause this high temp?  I would like to run the a/c, but if it is going to mean overheating problems and limited reliability, I will scrap the a/c and replace the tin, rather than risk breaking down.  Would an aux cooler help?  Any suggestions are appreciated!
Thanks
Mike
