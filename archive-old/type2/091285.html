&gt; Huhwhaaaa?  No wonder she's having problems.  The stock Bosch alternator is
&gt; cooled internally by an air duct routed to the fan housing.  A different
&gt; alternator in that spot would quickly overheat, not to mention that the tin
&gt; is probably not present to seal the engine compartment so her engine is
&gt; likely running hot as well.  I'm sorry she's having trouble, but jeez...
&gt; who put that alternator in there?  Thank goodness she is skilled enough to
&gt; have realized the problem and worked around it.

I wonder if an ordinary Delco alternator would fit in that spot?  I'm not
familiar with the type IV, but if a Delco alterntor would fit you would
get plenty of amps, self-cooling, and easy parts availability.
