Subject: 83 Aircooled Vanagon For Sale

For Sale:

1983 Vanagon with camper conversion kit.  40,900 original miles! Lovingly 
maintained air-cooled engine equipped Vanagon has traveled the Pacific NW 
and Alaska.  Rebuilt engine has less than 3000 miles, recently replaced 
exhaust manifold and muffler.  Excellent tires, and body is in very good 
shape because the vehicle has been garaged for most if it's life.  Moving 
to Texas and will consider any offer in the neighborhood of $3800.

Contact Dave at (360)668-9818 or dam0002_at_earthlink_dot_net if you are 
interested.
