&gt; &gt;Hi all - Does anyone know where I can find an extension for the shifter on my '71 Bus?  Thanks very much.
&gt;
&gt; The one I've got on my '75 came from a wrecked Bus in a junkyard, but I think
&gt; Bus Boys has them .. I nosed at Bus Depot and couldn't find a listing, but that
&gt; doesn't mean they don't have them also.

ages ago, and I do mean an eternity ago I got one from JCwhipme
