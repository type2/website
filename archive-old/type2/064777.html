Subject: re: Vacuum Leak Checking

&gt;I took it to my local very friendly mechanic who hooked it up to his
&gt;machine which read the exhaust CO levels.  Here is his technique:
&gt;Let out a puff of propane into the area of suspected vacuum leak.
&gt;Watch the CO meter, if it jumps, the leak is in the area of the puff.

&gt;Worked great, and pointed me to 2 leaky areas, but here's the
&gt;question:

&gt;Is there a home mechanic equivalent to this vacuum leak check?
&gt;Another vacuum leak technique?
&gt;A cheap CO meter?

I think your mechanic's method is most accurate.  However I have heard of
folks without CO meters who just watch the tach while shooting small jets
of propane around suspected leak areas.

Back in the old days I even heard of guys who would hook up a tachometer
and use carburetor cleaner spray to hunt down leaks.  When the spray was
drawn into the intake manifold it slowed down the engine.
