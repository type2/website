Subject: rear brake pad retaining pins

Hello.

I'm having a terrible time getting the replacement brake pad retaining pins/springs to go back on the rear brakes of my 71.  I've just about come to the conclusion that the pins are too short.  I tried and tried and tried and tried to make the new pins and springs go on, but they just won't.  I also tried to put the old springs back on with the new pins and that won't work either.  All I can think of is that the new pins are too small.  Has anyone else had a similar problem or have any tips for getting these darn things in place?

thanks in advance...
