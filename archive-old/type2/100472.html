Subject: Re: [T2] FLAPS - Trak Auto - follow up

Hey, guys and gals, there IS a tooth fairy!!

The company that took over Trak Auto is Advance Auto.  Their rep responded 
to my question as follows:

&gt;From: Sherry Hastings &lt;shastings_at_advanceautoparts_dot_com&gt;
&gt;To: honey_bus_at_hotmail_dot_com
&gt;Subject: Trak/Advance  Battery Warranty
&gt;Date: Mon, 4 Nov 2002 10:24:44 -0500

&gt;Dear Barry Burneskis,
&gt;   Our policy states, as long as you have your original receipt we will be
&gt;happy to warranty your Trak battery for a &quot;like&quot; Advance battery. I hope
&gt;this answers your question. If you have any questions or concerns please do
&gt;not hesitate to call me.
&gt;Thank You,

&gt;Sherry Hastings
&gt;Advance Auto Parts
&gt;Region 54
&gt;Administrative Assistant
&gt;Telephone: 410-526-2049
&gt;Fax: 410-526-4271


So for all you local people with the Trak Auto lifetime guarantees, keep 
your receipts and give their return policy a crack.

I am coming back at them with a torn CV boot &amp; receipt, right after I get my 
battery!!  And my brake shoes should still be good for life, I hope.  Good 
for life?? - I just hope they don't send over a hit man to 'terminate' my 
lifetime guarantee!!!

Barry sends
