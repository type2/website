Subject: Re: [T2] Accelerator cable

My '71 has a cable with a loop at the end that goes through the punched
hole in the throttle bellcrank.

I thought that the &quot;S&quot; hook style was for bugs, but I'm no expert on this.

Be sure to compare lengths with the original cable before going to the
trouble of installing it.  Don't forget the generous slathering with
grease as you install it!

When you get a new cable buy another as a spare.  You'll thank me someday!

&gt; Hello all.. Does anyone have experience replacing an accelerator cable
&gt; on a 1970 Westy?  I ordered the new cable and it differs from the
&gt; original.  The end which attaches to the pedal assembly is an &quot;s&quot; shape
&gt; on the new one, and a &quot;donut&quot; shape on the original.
