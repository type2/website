Subject: re rear engine mounts

Does anyone know how to replace the rear engine mounts on a 78 bus?  I have
read through the Bentley book, but haven't been able to find a section that
covers this.  Both mounts look like they are shot.  I found a piece of one
of them laying on the bar they bolt to.  How critical are they? How much of
a PITA is it to replace them?  Any help would be greatly appreciated..

Thanks,  Graham
