&gt; I have a 70... it has 72 front and rear spindles, so I could get frontdisk

&gt; What I would like to do now is get 73+ brake calipers, as they are bigger
&gt; and even better, but the front spindles are different to accommodate the
&gt; larger caliper - so I need to know if
&gt; 
&gt; A) the RIMS for a 70-72 will fit the 73+ brake hub   and

'71 And up, all the rims are the same (narrow 5, flat hub caps)
'70 and down are all wide 5 with domed hub caps

&gt; B) is there any reason to swap the 73+ REAR brake stuff out, too?

Well, your wheels will then match.  '71 and up rear hubs also have
composite drums, making brake maintainance easier

For the late-model front, you will need spindles, hubs, disks, calipers,
and the hardware to put it together.

The later calipers won't give any better braking than the early calipers.
the pistons and the shoes are the same area in both.  However, the late
calipers will give an additional 40% pad life between changes, due to
thicker friction material.
