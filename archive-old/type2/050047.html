Electric pump? Stock or aftermarket? Filters all clean, including the carb
mesh screen?Check that you are getting fuel out of the pump in a continuous
flow, use a bucket to check this, WELL away from any spark etc., unless you
have the marshmallows and wienees handy for the bonfire. Check the pumps
specs, how much gas should be in the bucket for a certain time. Web
progressives are difficult to set up, but once running are very good carbs.
Let me know how you do, I have a complete article on tuning them from the
&quot;Performance Engines Book 2&quot; by HotVW's.

&gt; Well I've scoured the archives and my (rather useless) Weber book and am
&gt; still in the search of some conclusive evidence. Yes, it's the big
&gt; question on everyone's mind: &quot;How do you get that Weber carburetor
working?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; First some statistics: It's a 32/34 DFAV on a '78 Bus with an electric
&gt; fuel pump. I took the whole darn thing apart because it wasn't working
&gt; right and needed a thorough cleaning. After pulling it apart, replacing
&gt; diaphragms and just about everything that could be replaced (except the
&gt; float) I cleaned the sucker with the big bucked 'o carb cleaner and putt
&gt; it back together. I popped it on the engine with the idle adjustment
&gt; screw set at the default 2 turns and it started well enough, and then
&gt; died. So, encouraged, I started it again... same story. I gets a real
&gt; nice start, runs happily for about 2-5 seconds and dies. I proceeded to
&gt; adjust the idle mixture screw every which way imaginable with only
&gt; variable degrees of success.
&gt;
&gt; Still the problem remains, the car will not idle for more than 10
&gt; seconds. And if I get it going, pushing on the accelerator just kills it
&gt; completely. The automatic choke is allright, and the float level is set
&gt; as per the instructions, so I'm thinking that something else is going
&gt; on. My hypothesis is that it's getting gas just fine for a few happy
&gt; seconds and then the float bowl runs out. Is this correct, or should I
&gt; look at other things?
&gt;
&gt; I apologize if this is a repeated question, it's just hard to get
&gt; straight answers for it.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you,
&gt; Bj Warminski
