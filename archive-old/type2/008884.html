Hey Y'all,
  I will start by telling you the Busses are both in Graham Wa, near
Tacoma Wa.
My 70 Bus is still for sale, but I am droping the price to $800. It has
the pop-top, Z-bed, etc...
The second is a 73 sunroof bus. I just put a Weber set-up on it and it
does run, but needs to be rebuilt. It has low compression on #3 and is
a little noisy. The body is real nice, no rust and very little dents.
It is an Automatic. Would make a nice bus $300 O.B.O
I realy need to sell both Busses, I will take any reasonable offer on
either one, they must go. I have a 77 coming that I need to make room
for and the wife says the others have to go.
Call me at (253)-846-2004 any time.
