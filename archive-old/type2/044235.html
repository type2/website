Hi Folks,

I have just embarked on the cross-country run from DC to LA via Toronto.  As I
was leaving Washington my hazards went on the blink, and took the indicators
with them.

I have been into the little relay sitting on top of the metal case for the
hazards (via the radio slot).  The problem is really simple, the plastic circuit
board that pops onto the metal case has come off.  My problem is getting it to
stay back on.

Any suggestions.  My main worry is that the guy behind me can't remember what my
hand signals mean.

p.s. does anyone know of a parts person in the Toronto area?
