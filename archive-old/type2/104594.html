Subject: Re: [T2] '78 engine carrier

So I guess you could put the engine back in sans carrier and exhaust and
then install the carrier and exhaust in *that* order.

I believe you are correct. I did install it afterwards but it required the
exhaust to be off, if not the fan shroud.

Well, here is a little bit of serendipity, anyway, because I have to replace
the muffler anyway.. it had a hole in it. It's nice when things work out
like that.
