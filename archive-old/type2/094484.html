Subject: getting the elec. fuel pump running

 Per Steve,

&gt;key to ignition, nothing - no longer any fuel pump buzz. triple &gt;check +/- at the fuel pump and its ok. basic test for life at the &gt;2Xrelay. light out!

88y/z to 85 right? this is directly (via solenoid) from battery. You know you're battery's got 12.5. If you have nothing here then you have to chase 88y/z to the solenoid to the battery to find the problem. This isn't a relay problem. It's your battery+ supply or a bad ground.

&gt;changed 2Xrelay and light on (gnd to 88's). horrah. ignition on &gt;then zilch. check 2nd 2Xrelay, no light. blown 2 relays?

No. I thought so to and was swapping relays. You've got a bad wiring connection (I bet bad ground) and it's showing up/disappearing as you move wires/devices around. Trace your 85 to ground. Good connection/low resistance?

&gt;101 degrees and not giving up.

Exactly where I was two weeks ago.

Stay with it,

Billy
