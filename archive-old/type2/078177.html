the interior is there and intact, with a new seat cover the front swival 
seats would be prefect. 
So how do you mean interior. It has the rear mattress, rear seat that 
converts to bed and small seat by sink. What part of or all do you want? 
Where are you at and how to get it to you? It's free, so long as it does not 
cost me, you can take the whole thing if you want, and I'm still located in 
Mayport, Fl. My phone number is (904)247-8197
