Subject: Cost estimate: Repack the bearings

Hi folks

I have a sneaking suspicion that I might need to repack the bearings on the
front driver's wheel of my 79 Bus.  I do not have a garage or even a driveway
and probably will not be able to do this myself.  I was wondering if anybody had
an idea what it would cost for me to get this done at a garage.

Thanks

Paul
