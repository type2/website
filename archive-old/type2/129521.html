Subject: I just stripped the interior of my 73 Westy...

&gt;How can people drive without all the interior stuff? Man is it LOUD!!! heh..
&gt;
Enjoy the spritely performance of a VW camper without all
the weight of the interior parts to slow you down.  :-)

&gt;Anyway, I finally ripped the interior out. All the cabinets, seats,
&gt;everything. The plywood floor had disintegrated into moldy dust.
&gt;Nasty. Virtually all the vertical wood that touched the floor was
&gt;rotted and moldy. As expected.  ...
&gt;

In the '80s, my icebox melt water drain failed.  Water between
the wooden and steel floor ruined the original floor.  Replaced
the floor promptly with no further damage.  Went and did it again
around Y2K to replace the right rear curtain (behind the cabinet)
and to freshen up the aging floor.

Consult your green Bentley manual, Chapter 1.
I recall only two screws which penetrate the wooden and steel
flooring.  Both are located in the walk thru aisle and hold the
sink/icebox down with an L-bracket.


Help:  I would like to know the length of the floor piece.  From
the heater vent on the floor to the end beneath the Z-bed.
I made my recent floor a bit too long.  I can always cut it shorter.




As the layout goes, I would prefer that my entire SO-42 interior
be mirrored L to R.  Icebox behind the driver (left side), and the
closet behind the driver as well.  Finally, the jumpseat near the
sliding door.  I use a portable cooker, outside the bus.  I imagine
RHD versions may have the closet behind the driver, and no 'blind
spot' from the closet.

Regards,

-Jack
