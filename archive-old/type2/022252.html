Subject: Re: 78 windsheild wipers don't work
Message-Id: &lt;4.2.0.37.19990524125938.041b5230_at_pop&gt;

Check the ground to the wiper motor and the switch.  Been there, done 
that.  Got so irritated after my 3rd switch (kept telling the FLAPS guy 
that the switches were the problem) I had to take a breather.  After a 
while I went and had a look again just cleaning and checking everything 
again.  Ended up being a couple of wires were switched around and the 
ground on the switch plug was not the same as the chassis ground.  When I 
removed my switch from the dashboard (thereby the chassis ground) 
everything worked correctly.

I have a diagram somewhere, but I don't think I could find it.  I would be 
happy to try and help by remembering the schematic if you need though.

Let me know if I can help

&gt;Before you go into the PITA job of taking the wiper motor out, try to
&gt;unscrew the wiper switch from the dashboard. Mine works perfectly when it
&gt;hangs free.
&gt;It seems like when the switch fails it connects the plus side to the shell
&gt;of the switch. Isolating it from the dashboard with plastic washers or
&gt;letting it hang free under the dashboard is the cheap and fast fix.

&gt; &gt;Hey Volks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Almost done sorting out my first Westy ('78 2.0L, FI,
&gt; &gt;auto). PO had it sitting for 2 years, It now *runs*
&gt; &gt;(compression 120,125,100,135) and *drives*.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I need to get the windshield wipers to work. The
&gt; &gt;wipers blow the fuse when I switch them on. Any
&gt; &gt;testing tips, or suggestions on where to start whould
&gt; &gt;be appreciated.
