&gt; I own VW jetta currently.  This bus I am buying has no engine in it so I
&gt; am looking for another engine to put in it.  It has the mounting brackets
&gt; for a bug engine but I don't know what engine to get.  I don't want to get
&gt; the stock engine power and I don't want the most powerful engine in the
&gt; world.  Something that will get me going pretty good, doesn't hog gas, will
&gt; do good on the interstate so I can go atleast 80-90 Mphs without pushing it,
&gt; and something not to costly.  Does anybody know were I can get a engine that
&gt; fits that description.  Some were online, in a magazine, or at a local
&gt; store??  Thanx peeps.  See ya.

Richard Childress in Welcome, NC (http://www.rcrracing_dot_com, but his site is
under reconstruction), builds an engine that will make a Bus go 90 MPH
without pushing it, but the price is a bit steep--he charges $35,000 for one
of his engines--and you'll need to call Kennedy Engineered Products for a
flywheel housing adapter. (Ask for one for a Chevrolet 350CID V-8.) Then
you'll need to reengineer the suspension to go that fast, and run hoses for
a radiator.

In case you haven't noticed, the front of a Bus is shaped like a brick wall.
In order to get a Bus to go 90MPH without straining the engine, you'll need
many hundreds of horsepower...so yeah, a Winston Cup race engine will
probably do it. Maybe.
