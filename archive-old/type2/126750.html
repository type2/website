Since I don't have any way to weld, would it be possible to replace
body panels with this stuff in combination with pop rivets? I know
welding would be ideal, but lack of $$ makes it impossible any time

IF you do a lot of homework on this...Curing times, temperatures,
etc. It should work...The Morgan Aero 8 (running at Le Mans, BTW)
has a glued and riveted frame and a price tag of $100,000 so price
was probably not a factor in the decision to use advesives...
