Subject: Exhaust fumes

Hi All,

I've read the archives on exhaust fumes, esp the posts from a couple of
months ago (JUST before I joined the list).

My '76 twin carb gets fumey when going down hill or backing off the
accelerator.  I think the heater is somehow disconnected, because at the end
of the heat control slider in the front is a z bend in the wire, with
nothing connected to it

&gt;&gt; as an aside, any tips on what to connect this too?  There is also another
cable tucked under the steering column thats got a funny loopy thing on the
end - it desn't seem to move much when I push / pull it, and it doesn't seem
right to connect directly to the heat control &lt;&lt;

back to the fumes, the heater is disconnected, so I suspect its not causing
the fumes.  The engine hatch (both internal and external) seal is fine.  The
engine seal is fine.  The backdoor seal is new aside from about 10&quot; along
the very bottom.  There is a bit of oil in the upper engine bay, and since I
just adjusted the valves the valve cover gaskets are leaking (they were fine
before).  I will fix this very soon.  Other than that it drops a lot of oil
from the oil strainer (I've got a new gasket kit now, but haven't fitted it
yet - again, I'll do it soon).  Of more concern I think there is fuel in the
oil (very very smelly).  I'm trying to pull to fuel pump to replace /
overhaul if possible as I think it is also leaking oil.  I don't quite know
about the exhaust location - it exits where all the others that I've noticed
do - pointing rearward from the rh side of the bus.

i suspect that the problem is related to the fuel in the oil.

The smell clears quickly when accelerating again.

Any thoughts appreciated.
