&gt; I just recently converted my 81 vanagon to carbs from fuel injection.  
&gt; Everything went pretty well except for one thing. There is a oil breather- I 
&gt; think- that is located at the top of the motor.  When it was fule injected, 
&gt; it had a vacuum tube that connected to it, but now that it is carberated, it 
&gt; has no where to go.  If I plug it up, oil leaks out where the cap sits on 
&gt; the opening.  If I don't plug it, and let the tube hang there, it leaks some 
&gt; oil.  Not a tremendous amount, but enough to make me concerned.  What can I 
&gt; do with this?  Can I plug it off permanently?  Can I add an oil cooler to 
&gt; this?

Not sure what you mean by &quot;adding an oil cooler to this&quot; but I'd think 
the correct set up would be to route the tube into the carbs' intakes 
somehow, maybe through the air filter box(es).  The positive crankcase 
pressure vents through this valve/tube and should be recycled into the 
intake.
