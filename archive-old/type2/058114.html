Subject: RE: stuck battery cable clamps

Why not just use a battery cable terminal puller?  Less than $5.00 at your 
local FLAPS.

Loosen and clean up the terminals as much as possible, then just pop them off 
with the puller.  The battery posts are tapered -- 

Battery acid from a cracked case can ruin your paint, bodywork, wiring, tools, 
hide, eyes, etc., etc., etc.....
