Subject: Re: [T2] EFI Blues :(  Possible fuel pump?

Kevin,
	I would start at the battery end. Make sure that you now have some
good voltage there. I believe that Sean reported a few days ago that
the fi system ran on something like 10 volts but ran bad. Since this
suddenly poped up after killing the battery. Give that a shot first &amp;
give us a shout back. Oh BTW, you are sure correct w/ not just
pull/replace. That never seems to fix much. I'll let dr Tim expound on
how important procedure &amp; testing is. It is.

&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; I'm still pretty new to the list and have new problems with my 80 westy.  The 
&gt; first part would be that I just did the lifters and somehow let the battery 
&gt; go dead by leaving the lights on for a night.  So any way finished the 
&gt; lifters went to start it and it would not start.  So I jumped it a couple of 
&gt; time and it still would idle so I charged the battery.  I jumped in and got 
&gt; it to fire up but still would not idle so I made it idle with my foot and 
&gt; drove it about 100 yards, that has always fixed the idle.  Not this time, I 
&gt; put it back in my spot and saw smoke coming from the dash, and I notice that 
&gt; the fuel pump does not make its normal hiss type sound when I put the key in 
&gt; and check the warning lights but they still work.  Now I don't know what to 
&gt; check or replace, the double fuel relay or the fuel pump or both. Limited 
&gt; funds and I used to work at a parts store and saw way to many people replace 
&gt; lots or wrong parts,  I would like to not be that guy.  Not sure if I can 
&gt; check either with a Voltage Meter or just blindly replace one or the other 
&gt; and hope for the best?  I only have the idiots book and that's not helping 
&gt; much right now.  Any help with this would be great.
&gt; Thanks
