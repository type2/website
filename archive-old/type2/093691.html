&gt; it and stuff.  Here's the kicker and she swears it's true. It had a

Possible but dubious. =^ ) Assuming a 54&quot; x 75&quot; waterbed (a standard 
double-size mattress, quite small for two people if they are pitching 
about together but let's go with it) twelve inches deep, that's 48,600 
cubic inches of water. At .036 pounds per cubic inch, that's right at 
1750 pounds. Let's add 300 lbs for two fairly light occupants.

Assuming no other gear in the truck, 2050 lbs is not beyond the carrying 
ability of a splitty, but it's at the limit of safety and definitely 
pushing the limit of comfort. Stopping would be an ordeal. Stopping on 
short notice would be impossible. Stopping in San Francisco would have a 
VERY high pucker factor. It's very unlikely anybody would drive around 
like this for long and survive to tell about it.

This leaves aside the unpleasant prospect of an unheated water bed in 
the first place.

But it's a fun story anyway. =^ )
