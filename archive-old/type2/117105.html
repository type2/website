Subject: 72 bus

Hello,

Welcome to the type2 list.  You will find many people on the list are quite
knowledgeable and/or helpful.

Off hand I'm not sure what your plugs are for.  I'll just say that one
thing you'll find on youe 30+ year old bus is that many modifications have
probably been made for various reasons.

As an introduction to your new 72 I suggest that the secret is to 'put your
heart' into your new bus.  If you take the time to get to know it then you
can keep it running for many happy travels.  It's kind of a zen thing, and
what I've found what helps is to get to know your van's little quirks.
Once you become comfortable with everything then you'll know when it works
well and/or not as well as it could.

Also it is important to learn the VW basics  : check your plugs, cap, rotor
and points and timing if you don't know how already, and on top of that
inspect and change your fuel lines as soon as you can.  Sometimes those
lines are 30 years old and it only takes 30 minutes and 5$ of parts to
freshen them up.

Other than that just relax, take it easy and enjoy the view from the
beautiful big bay windows.  Welcome to the list.

Best regards,
Shawn.
Montreal, Quebec.
