The wire that should be hooked to the electromagnetic cut-off valve runs
from the coil and also the automatic choke and I think the pilot jets. On my
69 its a little simpler, but if the wire is disconnected it won't idle worth
a cr_at_p. Check the wiring diagram in Bentley to be sure I'm not full of it,
then hook the thing up correctly to see if it works, if not then go buy a
new one. If you don't have Bentley I can scan a copy of the diagram from my
book (also I think they are in the type 2 library for some years, and they
are in color).
Hope this helps,

&gt; &gt; dave russel and kelly who told me to check my
&gt; &gt; electromagnetic idle cut-off valve(big thanks).
&gt; &gt; when
&gt; &gt; i got home i unscrewed it part of the way and my
&gt; &gt; idle
&gt; &gt; came right up.   thanks everyone for all the help,
&gt; &gt; im
&gt; &gt; now in search for a replacement.   as a side note,
&gt; &gt; this valve originally had  a wire connected to it
&gt; &gt; which i understand its function, but it has not been
&gt; &gt; connected for about a year and ive never had idling
&gt; &gt; problems before?
&gt;
&gt; Ummm...if it hasn't even been hooked up, how do you
&gt; know that it needs replacing??? I don't know on a '73,
&gt; but on my '69, the wire goes from the cut-off, to the
&gt; electric choke-solenoid, and then to the
&gt; coil....probably the same, but you should find out for
&gt; sure.
&gt;
&gt; One other note, I recently checked prices on these
&gt; little buggers (mine's bad) and found Bus Depot to
&gt; have them at about 1/3 the cost of my local FLAPS for
&gt; my brosol 30/31 POC (Piece-Of-Crap;-) carb. You might
&gt; check 'em out.
