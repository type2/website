Maybe Andy should have used a hammer against a smallish piece of plywood
wrapped in a towel. to tap his windshield without pushing so hard as to
break it.  Using a hammer gives you the advantage of applying LESS overall
force, because you also have the advantage of velocity.  But of course, not
hammer on glass.  You have to whack something soft against the glass or
rubber.

&gt; Folks, let's not get paranoid about &quot;hitting&quot; the glass! I've seen at
least 60
&gt; Bus windshields installed(10 were mine!) by pro installers, and to a man,
they
&gt; all hit the glass, and not a light tap. I installed a junkyard glass
myself, 5

Real life experience here,
My old '69 had a cracked windsheild for quite a while. My sweet wife got
me a windsheild for the holidays and I had a pro shop install it for me
and they did not have an easy time of it. One edge of the windsheild/seal
bothered me because it didnt seem to be fully seated in the frame. On e
day a few moths later while we were at a friends house I decided to give
it a little push, and then a harder push, and then a few more persuasive
efforts with open disributed palms. DOH! I never replaced the windsheild
in the '69 again and lived with it until I got a new bus.
Dont hit I say!
My 2 pfennigs.
