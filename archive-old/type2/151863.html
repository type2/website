Subject: RE: [T2] One version of why we are &quot;orphans&quot; of VW

Ron,

Absolutely outstanding letter(or what should be one).

I wonder if VWOA or VWAG would properly appreciate the sentiments 
involved, or maybe whether their sales and marketing staff would 
understand at all??

And I have worked for Volkswagen.  :-((

In regard to dealerships, the local Ford dealer is one of the very best 
around...for 36,000 miles I got stellar treatment...they even fixed things 
on the bumper to bumper warranty that I didn't consider to be their 
problem.

The bad news was that once the warranty was out, my $7,000 5speed 
transmission actually started failing....and they currently sold nothing 
that I was remotely interested in....so after 15-20 years of Fords, I 
switched to Subaru....so far the dealer has beeen passable, but they don't 
really know me yet.

The Subaru guys love it when I stop by in the Champagne Edition to pick up 
oil filters for the Subie....after all they both have FI boxster engines!

I almost feel sorry for the local VW/BMW dealer....watched them try to 
explain to an &quot;older&quot; couple with a brand new 3 series BMW why their
oil change cost them $175!!!!!!

I was so embarrased that I walked out without picking up the part I went 
in for.

Something is wrong and I can't quite figure out what it is....

Probably a Friday topic, but considering today is the last day before the 
holiday, it probably qualifies for &quot;Friday&quot;....besides, I did mention my 
bus&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave
