Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Swap Info?

Well, I might as well chime in on this on as everyone else seems to have.  I
am on the lines of make the bus work for you. But do it right.  Are
passenger buses converted to campers any less a bus?

I have had a 74 Riviera for 2 years that I saved from the junk yard, where
she had sat for 10 years.  I haven't done a thing to her except clean her
out and put her in the garage. She came without an engine or tranny.  A nice
T4 Engine rebuilt was gonna run me a good bit.  And with gas prices not
showing any signs of reverting back to the 70's when she was built.  I am
having her switched over to VW Diesel and also over to waste veggie oil.
Her heart will still be VW.  And she will be environmentally friendly.
Plus she will be getting 30-50 mpg on free waste oil.  The only two
noticable mods will be a larger over the engine access hatch (2 stock ones
welded together) and the engine lid will house the radiator.  If you don't
like it tough.  I'll wave as I pass you at the gas station. And if anything
ever happens to me, there will be a list of every non-stock part in the
glove box.

There's my .02.  Take it or leave it.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
