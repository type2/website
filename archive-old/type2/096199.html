well one tiny nit to bring up

&gt; I am getting a pod case for three 2.0625&quot; meters to mount side by side of 
&gt; This pod will be mounted under the dash and upside down, with the meters 
&gt; slightly angled towards me for easy reading while driving. The pod will be 
&gt; just to my right as I sit in the driver's seat.

this pod is designed for mounting upright, it probably would not be a
problem upside down except that the gauges in the pod are angled to the
left (when upright) so mounting it upside down would angle the guages to
the passenger side (USA side of the road driviing position) and possibly
making them harder to read.  I have this pod and like it but I found it
fits nicely on top of the dashboard up close to the windshield, wires go
through a hole in the radio speaker grill.
