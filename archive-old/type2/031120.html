&gt; where someone mentioned it took about two hours to drop a 72 up engine and 4

&gt; So I was wondering is this typical? I can have my 64 Single Cab engine on

different folks have different abilities and experience in how often they
have pulled a particular engine.

&gt; the floor in 20 minutes from the time I pull in the garage. Ok I know this
&gt; is a DUMB QUESTION but do the bays have the removable rear apron? I have

some do, some don't,   pancake engines do not

&gt; It makes life so much easier to pull the engine strate back and out. Also
&gt; apples to apples how much harder or easier is it to work on a pancake

some things easier, some harder.   pulling an alternator is much easier.
other things the exact opposite.

&gt; engine? Is their tons of differences between an upright and the pancake?

early pancakes (TypeI) are pretty much the same, the later TypeIV engines
are very different, especially the Fuel Injected ones.   HOWEVER many
folks myself included think the improvements and advantages far outweigh
the disadvantages.

one of the problems is that the TypeIV is that it is larger and heavier
than the little type I engine.   that translates however into more power
and torque so it is worth the hassle.

I have a 78 with auto tranny and 2 liter FI engine.....I used to be able
to take my 60 engine out in an hour or so, alone.  with this engine I give
myself 2-3 hours with a helper for actually pulling it.   BUT I would
never go back to that little anemic engine, but mine is a daily driver
too, and much more can be done with the engine in the car than I could
with the older one.  makes it easier if the first time you pull it that
you put in some quick release connectors.   I don't think it is much
harder to work on, Just Different.
