Subject: Re: [T2] bringing a bus back from Canada

Dan, its often the luck of the draw as to who you get and whats happening at
the border that day
there four agencies that I can think of
DOT dept of transportation- responsible for the safety and compliance stuff
EPA environmental protection agency- responsible for the emission stuff
CARB calif air recourses board aka the gestopo, enforces ca more restrictive
emission standards
Customs whos job is to collect the money and keep out the illegal stuff
As Richard pointed out being 25years old it shouldn't be too hard.
If it became a problem you could use a customs broker, I've used them before
and they aren't horribly expensive.
I think you could do one of two things. Either have him drive it across with
all the paperwork and declare it as newly bought (sorry, I cant remember
what the exemption limit is for returning US citizens) or heres a thought,
drive it across yourself and have a friend follow to pick you up and return
you, or drive across grab a beer, buy some cheap smokes and walk back a hour
or so later. I know this would work at the whirlpool or peace bridge
crossing, don't think I'd try it at the Windsor crossing
Chuck

.
&gt; It already has a mph speedo, and I don't think it has to meet any calif
&gt; emissions requirements because it's pre-71, as you mentioned.
&gt;
&gt; Is epa something different?
&gt;
&gt; Any clues on how to &quot;clear customs&quot;?
&gt;
&gt; Is it ok for him to drive it back on my Canadian plates (which are still
&gt; good) and just tell the customs people that he's just purchased it?
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure if there's a &quot;maximum import amount&quot; for someone that is
&gt; returning to the US. Do you know?
