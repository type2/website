Subject: 70 Westy FS AUSTIN

Seafoam and white, red interior, weird green/black/white speckled carpet
(looks like underpadding, but isnt), has the little stool.
Electricals are hacked a tad, has a nice stereo, new-looking rubber.
Paint job is nice, but looks like a really good amateur did it - line
between white and green is pretty jagged.
Baby moons, nice tires.
Know nothing about engine, as I merely cased it in a parking lot.


DOWN SIDE: $7,500!!!!!

512-440-1124; call them, not me.

Nice bus, but a california price; If I were buying it would make a counter
offer, but I don't think they'd take the ~$2800-3000 I'd peg as an upper
limit.

But hey, maybe you REALLY NEED a 70 Westy!

If you are THAT serious, I would look further for you.............

70 Neunsitzer
65 Pritschenwagen
