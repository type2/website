Subject: Zelenda (???) and 12-point star sockets

Anyone ever deal with a place in Queens, NY that goes by the name
Zelenda (I think)?  They specialize in &quot;Volkswagen, Audi, and Porsche
parts and tools.&quot;  I was asking a friend of mine about the 12-point
tool for removing CV bolts, and he told me to call them.
800-information had their number, and when I called and asked for a
catalog, they took my name and address.  I'll see what I get.
If anyone's interested, their # is (888) 892-8348.

So, anyone ever ordered from them?

BTW, will a Torx bit fit those 12-point bolt heads?  Anyone know what
size?  If I try Torx, am I just asking for stripped bolt heads?
On the 12-point thingermajigger, if I do find a place that sells it,
what size do I need?

TIA,
Rodney
