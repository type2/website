Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Tank

Dean,

Go search the archives for Richard Atwell's link to his terrific shots of 
cleaning out a 78 tank...yours will be slightly different.

Go to the por-15 site and read the faq on the kit that they sell to clean 
out your tank.

Go look at www.busdepot_dot_com fuel senders for your year and see if you got 
the correct sender.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello List,
&gt; 
&gt;     I recently pulled the fuel tank in my 72 bus because the sender was
&gt; no longer working.  Before I had the old sender out of the fuel tank, I
&gt; went ahead and order a new sender from California Import Parts.  Well

&gt; have is a column sender and not a float.  So I am now looking for
&gt; another type of sender that I can install into my fuel tank.  I also
&gt; noticed that I need to get the inside of the tank cleaned.
&gt; 
&gt; So I have two questions;
&gt; 
&gt; 1.    Does anyone know where I can find another type of sender?
&gt; 
&gt; 2.    How do I go about getting the inside of the fuel tank cleaned.  I
&gt; heard about this POR-15.
