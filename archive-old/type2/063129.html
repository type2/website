Hmm... let's see if I understand the slang. I was thinking that a 
breadloaf was the large windowed (73+) van w/o side windows... or does 
it take in all of these models?

I have no idea of what a &quot;feathery machine&quot; is.

As for waves, I think it depends on the model of the van, because of the 
mind-set of the owner. Anyone driving one of the older vans does so as a 
hobby, as much as for transport. The newer vans are (often) driven by 
commuters.

I don't think dad would have waved to other VWs back when he drove one 
(in the late 60s, early 70s)... it was just transportation to him.

BTW, the same hold true for motorcycle owners. Harley owners usually 
wave only to other Harleys... and Honda cruisers don't wave to anyone 
unless they are &quot;driving&quot; a motorcycle (as opposed to riding one).
