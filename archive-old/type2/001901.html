&gt;or downhill with a heck of a tailwind.  I got that once drafting a semi
&gt;for about 50 miles, wasn't worth the white knuckles


Hey Drafting semis if great fun. I used to do it all the time on my drives
back and forth between the carolinas and St. Pete florida untill my  wife
woke up while doing it. She says it makes her nervous. I say go back to
sleep , we will be there in no time........=)
