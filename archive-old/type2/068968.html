Subject: VIN number musings

Over the past year or so, I have sent off my VIN numbers to VW and received
a response on each.  In each case the letter I got back was a little
different in wording, but all very nice.  Also in each case the information
I got back was a little different.  I don't have the address handy, but it's
in the archives.

'73 Campmobile:
The VIN tag says Typ 23-517; the letter says Model 231-941; the first 3 VIN
#s are 233.  The Option tag says XH, which the letter says is the delivery
code to Netherlands.  This bus has the original engine, which is verified by
the letter.  No color is mentioned in the letter.  There was over a month
between the production and delivery dates, perhaps due to the Westfalia
conversion - production March 21st, 1973; delivery April 27th, 1973.

'68 Crew Cab Pickup
The VIN tag says Typ 26-16; the letter says Model 265-021, the first 3 VIN
#s are 268.  The Option tag says UH, which the letter says is the delivery
code for San Antonio/Houston, U.S.A.  The color section in the letter states
that it is &quot;not registered&quot;.  There are 9 days between production and
delivery dates - production Dec. 7th, 1967, delivery Dec. 18th, 1967.

'68 Deluxe Transporter (?)
The VIN tag says Typ 28; the owners manual has written in type 2211, the
letter says Model: Volkswagen Clipper, the first 3 VIN #s are 228.  This is
interesting because in the early '50s Piper and Pan Am had a court case over
the use of the name Clipper.  The court decided in favor of Pan Am and Piper
had to rename their airplane.  This is the only letter I have received with
a model name instead of number.  The color is given for this bus: exterior:
lotos white, interior: indian red - that's their spelling w/ no caps.  The
Option tag says UW, which the letter says is the code for Washington, USA.
I assume that this really means Washington D.C., since I have the original
owners manual and this bus was purchased new on February 26, 1968 in
Pennsylvania.  There are 3 days between production and delivery - production
January 16th, 1968, delivery January 19th, 1968.

Fun exercise.
