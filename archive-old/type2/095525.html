Subject: RE: [T2] Accu-fire rehabilitated?

In all reality you should be able to take it back from whoever you purchased
it from for a exchange. I know I refunded the money back for at least 10 of
them before I quit selling them and have a few ordered to replace bad ones I
sold. Those are at least on local off road cars so I don't have P'd off
customers. I still will not sell them until they are proven. Last time I
sold them they were 30 to 35 dollars a unit.

ronnie

ps. Do you have the Accu-Fire or the Mag-Fire this might help me in helping
you get a replacement

Ronnie,
Since you talked to them, I am wondering.........
If I have  a failed unit of theirs that suffered infant mortality,
are they interested in taking the faulty one back and giving me a new one 
of the proper construction?

I'd be willing to try one of their &quot;new&quot; ones on a replacement basis and 
report back what I find.
As is, I have one that failed almost immediately, and want no more of that, 
of course.
