Subject: Re: [T2] Air Shock/Tortion bar advice

There is an article somewhere - Type 2 library? - called Journeys under 
Difficult Conditions. It is a VW factory document that tells you how to 
prepare your vehicle for a difficult journey.

I would at least add some steel bars under the engine. I added a home built 
by me trailer hitch (tm) a few years ago. It had a bar that ran left to 
right under the muffler and then had two bars that ran forward from the 
cross bar to meet at the front tranny mount.

Was very good at protecting the engine and several times it saved my bacon 
when I was offroad and rolled slowly off of stone steps. The hitch took the 
banging and no damage ever.

&gt;&gt;I'm heading down to Baja for several months and will be off-road a lot,
&gt;&gt;and I'm looking for rear ground clearance advice and alternatives. My
&gt;&gt;ASI conversion has a couple inches of rear end sag, and to make matters
&gt;&gt;worse the shop that did the last rebuild (done by PO) added a Berg-type
&gt;&gt;1.5 qt sump, which also cost a couple inches of ground clearance and
&gt;&gt;seems pretty exposed down there, although the extra oil does seem to
&gt;&gt;help with engine cooling.
&gt;
&gt;I agree with Chris, ditch the sump immediately or you have major trouble 
&gt;the first time you hit it.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Bottom line is that I need to gain a minimum of three inches of
&gt;&gt;clearance back there. I'm wondering how much can be gained by tortion
&gt;&gt;bar adjustment, and how that adjustment relates to spring
&gt;&gt;compression/travel. Any advice/knowledge would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Be careful with torsion bar adjustment.  Too far and your bus will handle 
&gt;funny.
&gt;If you have aftermarket sway bars on the bus, take them off.  They will 
&gt;limit wheel articulation.
&gt;
&gt;The single best thing you can do for your bus in Baja (IMO) is to go down 
&gt;to Discount Tire and buy a pair of new BFG All-Terrain T/A KO tires, 
&gt;27x8.5x14.  Better yet, buy four.  They will give you some extra ground 
&gt;clearance as well as the best offroad traction you can get in a 14&quot; 
&gt;tire.  Yes, they will reduce your gear ratio slightly but if you can't get 
&gt;through something at full throttle in 1st gear you shouldn't have 
&gt;attempted it anyway.
&gt;
&gt;Also, bring a BIG floor jack, some 4-foot 2x12 planks, a quality 
&gt;come-along (test it first) and 100ft or more of strong rope for when you 
&gt;get stuck.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Alternatively, I just read an old post from a guy who had already
&gt;&gt;installed coil-over shocks, then changed to Napa coil-over air
&gt;&gt;adjustable shocks (Napa part MA758, which is still available).  He
&gt;&gt;mentioned some required spacers, but did not elaborate.
&gt;
&gt;I wouldn't put too much stress on the upper shock mount - I've seen them 
&gt;break under extreme circumstances.  KYB gas-adjusts will give you 1/2&quot; to 
&gt;3/4&quot; more ground clearance (at least they did on my bus).  Ground 
&gt;clearance is not the most important thing in a bus though - you already 
&gt;have plenty.  You will be traction-limited in most situations.  Remember 
&gt;that you have a lot of front and rear overhang so your approach angles are 
&gt;not very steep.  You WILL dent up the pedal pan on the front, and possibly 
&gt;your front bumper as well.  In the rear, don't let your muffler or heater 
&gt;boxes get hit, they are held on by eight small studs going into 
&gt;aluminum.  If you have a propane tank, be careful of that also.
&gt;
&gt; From experience I can tell you that places your bus will do reasonably 
&gt; well are steep, rocky, rutted/potholed roads and crossing creeks.  Lots 
&gt; of that in Baja.  Places your bus will NOT do well are low traction areas 
&gt; like mud and wet grass, also deep sand (low tire-to-weight ratio).  Stay 
&gt; away from these areas!  Get out and walk stuff first if you're not 
&gt; sure.  You should be able to get through sand up to about 5&quot; deep if you 
&gt; get a good run.  Speed helps in sand, right Nikki?  :)
