Subject: [T2] Junkyard finds, rear s belts

Hi everyone,
I took the day off to fix my wife's 325ix(new $$$$ fuel pump) and it 
went so well I had a bunch of time left.  I used it up going to a local 
wrecking yard that I had never gone to.  I left $42.00 lighter.  For 
my time found two bay Westies, one bay kombi and one Lime Green Advent-
urewagon that was pretty trashed.  One of the Westies had a pretty bad
engine fire(replace those lines!).  The other Westy is were I found my 
stuff.  Picked up an early ice rack and drain tray in great shape and 
the birch headliner over the driver/pass. along / the two side pieces
and the back hatch lower section.  All were in very decent shape.  There
was also the upper rear shelf and head liner in good shape.  I might
grab the headliner but would consider grabing the shelf for someone.
I think someone was looking for one a couple months ago.  pmail if int.

my main query is some seat belts that came from the Westy (72).  They are labeled 1971 and feature the lever release.  The belts are pretty 
stiff.  Will they loosen up with use??  The thread stiches 'look' intact
but does anybody have any opinions on whether they will still function
properly??  BTW these were for the Z bed and the jump seat behind the 
driver.(no jump seat present)

If these won't cut it, I might just grab the rear belts from a Scirocco.
I think G. Lyle mentioned this approach.
