&gt;I'd like to replace the seal now but I don't want to disturb the rust underneath until I can have the bodywork done to repair the damage.

For when you get around to fixing the windowsill...  I used to have a page up on the web with pictures describing how I did this job for the second time.  I somehow managed to lose the text of that page (which I had spent quite a bit of time writing, but as it turns out the procedures described did again NOT result in a long-term fix) but I found the pictures.  Since then I have repaired the rust a third time and it has been 2.5 years now and no reoccurance.  I re-wrote the text incorporating what I learned on the third time around, and added some new pictures (not as nice as yours, but I don't have an artistic bone in my body), which you may be interested in if your rust is not terminal:
