[...]  You will have a hard time finding these used in any better condition
than those you may already have.  I (er, a, actually, my wife), made
replacements from muslin fabric from the FLFS (friendly local fabric store).
She used the old curtains as patterns, and chose an off white color of
fabric, as the plaid pattern was not to be found.  I don't know of anyone
reproducing these curtains for sale.

&gt; Hi all;
&gt; Another phase in my restoration process:
&gt; Does anyone have any extra of the brown/yellow/white plaid curtain
&gt; material for the late 60s and early 70s Westfalias? I can buy or trade
&gt; (lots of parts available).
&gt; Thanks,
