List,
Doing some research on how to build a good, reliable, relatively strong type1
for this adventurewagen.

Anybody know how much more than a regular bus this thing weighs?

I have access to a fullcircle crank that ran three runs down a 1/8 mi track in
some monster rail engine before letting go of the flywheel. When the wheel
backed off, it allowed the dowels in the wheel to cut a groove around the end
of the crank - other than thit it is a good crank. My machinist friend
believes he can weld it up and drill the dowel holes back in and it should be
fine.  Cuss/discuss?

Might some sympathetic soul give me a rundown on a big T1 engine they have
built and successfully run in a bus?  I would like (flame suit on) to run the
Weber 2bbl on it - how best to build the engine so that it will handle this
carb correctly?

thanks volks,
clark in ky.
