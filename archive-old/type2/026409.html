Subject: Re: Fuel tank Venting: 72/77
Message-ID: &lt;CCONHBOLPAPFAAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

I have a nice explanation of the hoses from the canister that Karl von Salzen sent me; if anyone else is tackling this '77 engine into a '72 bus, i'll be happy to type this up and share it. 

What I'm still not sure about is that line that (in the '72 bus) runs under the gas filler neck toward the fuel tank. I don't know if that is in some other way tied in with the fuel venting system. If it is, then I probably need to block it off where it expects to meet with the '72 tank (because my '77 tank doesn't have this). If it isn't tied in with the system (other than via the tank and the charcoal canister in the '72), then I think I can just ignore it, since I won't be hooking my charcoal canister in this way; it will be hooked into the air cleaner.

Thanks! Joe


&gt;Dave:
&gt;I think there should be 2 large hoses hooked to the carbon cannister: 1
&gt;in and 1 out! In comes from the fan housing, out goes to the air
&gt;cleaner. In operation this air flow sweeps the vapors from the carbon
&gt;pellets into the air cleaner where they are mixed with air and swept
&gt;into the manifold.
&gt;They get into the carbon cannister via the smaller tubing from the tank
&gt;vents.
