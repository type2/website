&gt; Dear John, George and others,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the prompt and detailed replies. The more I think about it, the
&gt; more I remember about my last rebuild. It seems like the only way to get
&gt; it backwards is to drop the distributor drive in while the engine is set
&gt; at #1 is at the top of the exhaust stroke, not the compression stroke
&gt; (which is real top dead center, yes?), or at one of the other several
&gt; possible wrong places that the few camshaft gear teeth afford.

True.  the one positioning that requires skill is getting the cam in the
correct relationship relative to the cam, which is why you position the
drive with #1 at TDC of the compression stroke.  After you get that right,
the distributor _has_ to be right.

(Well, the distributor drive dog could be attached 180 degrees out as
well, but not many folks ever disassemble that.)
 The not so

&gt; And once the distributor drive's in, it won't come out unless I use a
&gt; magnet and pull it out.

There's a tool that grabs the drive and lets you pull it out.  You can
also use a tap on the center hole to get some purchase,  I've done it just
by twisting the drive while pulling upward on a big screwdriver, but that
was luck.

Try not to pull the drive out all the way.  Just disengage the teeth and
turn it to the correct position.  The teeth are slanted a bit, so the
drive will turn a bit as it drops into place.  There are two shims on the
bottom of the drive that will probably be OK if the engine stays flat
while you work with the drive, but if they get dislodged into the case
you'll play heck getting them back out.
