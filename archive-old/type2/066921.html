Subject: driving comparisons- '74 vs. '77

hey now,

well, i have two vw vans, a '74 Retrowestie and a '77 Westy. i've driven both
now and have noticed some differences in how they drive, handle the road, etc.
last weekend amanda and i went up to the mountains for a music festival..the
first trip in our '77.

now, these observations are just my opinions...and probably targest for flamers
as well! :-)

carb vs. fuel injection:

well, what can you say? fuel injection beats the carb hands down for
accerlation, power, mpg, etc. the '77 does fairly good on mpg, about 20-21mpg
compared to 16-17mpg on the '74 (single weber :-( ). the FI cranks right up in
cold and doesn't take as long to warm up the engine.

BUT, i still like carbs. on the '74 i feel more in control of my engine without
all that electrical stuff. i'm more comfortable fooling around with the carb
then that FI.

road handling--

well, the '74 beats the '77 hands down. why? cuz i have light truck tires, new
shocks, and a new steering damper on the '74! :-) best driving vehicle i've
ever had. the '77 still has the original shocks i think. boing boing. and
although the PO put new tires on, he didn't put lt or reinforced tires on it.

personal preference--

wow. this one is harder. i really like the westy cuz of all the comforts.
pop top. sink. cabinets all over. swivel seat. BUT me and Rumba ('74) have
a special bond. she's tougher i think. hardier. more spartan. but she's got
personality. Misha ('77 westy) seems a bit more timid. but that's just my
feeling. i like driving the '74 better i think. i dunno. more testing is
needed! :-)

maybe i need more buses for more testing!
