Subject: Re: [T2] Mid America Motorworks catalog

Richard,

They were overcharging for everything when the were mid-america to start 
with.  Now that they have bought out RMMW, you have fewer places to 
shop(or so they think).

On another note(friday), I recently purchased a new Subaru and have bought 
some engine &quot;performance upgrade&quot; parts.  A new turbo charger up-pipe(in 
stainless steel with a flex joint) that looks like a work of art for $89.

The equivalent item on a late bay might be a header pipe that would do 
away with all of the exhaust system between the two heater boxes...in 
stainless steel with gorgeous welding all around.

As a buddy of mine said...all the &quot;ricer&quot; parts look good and are 
generally well made.  We decided that if the VW suppliers out there made
parts this good for this cheap we would be in hog heaven.

What's wrong with this picture?

Have we put up with garbage for too long?

Cheers, dave

&gt; Those guys (formerlly RMMW) sent me a new catalog and it looks great but
&gt; unlike the RMMW catalog of old, they replaced all of the VW part numbers
&gt; with their own. Big thumbs down.

&gt; Unfortunately everything in their catalog is way overpriced. Does a large
&gt; outfit like that really need to charge $40 for Bentley?
