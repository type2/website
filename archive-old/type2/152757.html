&gt; To deal with some head issues (the Bus', not mine, at least this time),
&gt; I've
&gt; pulled off the hitch that came with this '71 I bought a while back and
&gt; have
&gt; lamely attempted to sketch out a design and take some photos for anyone
&gt; who
&gt; wants to build something similar for their own Bus (probably would work on
&gt; a
&gt; 68 through 71).  Records indicate that it was installed by a VW dealer in
&gt; Oregon in August of 1976 but at least some parts of the hitch seemed to
&gt; have
&gt; been manufactured by Draw-Tite so it's not something of pure German
&gt; origin.
&gt; If you'd like a copy of the sketch (it's a Word document), email me at
&gt; nickpace_at_rand_dot_org.  I'll also send you three sample photos I took but the
&gt; full
&gt; set runs about 5.5 megs and would probably overload your email system.  If
&gt; you
&gt; can handle them, let me know when you request the sketch and I'll send you
&gt; the
&gt; rest which would be very helpful if you ever actually decided to make one
&gt; of
&gt; these things.
&gt; Apologies for the crudeness of the drawing.  You'll quickly see why I
&gt; barely
&gt; got a C in my junior high drafting class back in 1968.
