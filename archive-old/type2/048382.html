Subject: [T2] Brake lines

Hey list, i have decided to replace all my metal brake lines, my master
cylinder, and get my booster rebuilt. Last year I replaced my rear wheel
cylinders, rebuilt my calipers and replaced my hoses. So I'm looking at the
parts for my 78 camper and bus depot has a 211 611 764A and a 211 611 764B
listed for my bus with different prices. This is true for several metal
lines where there is an A and a B. They are different lengths according to
Jerry, 764A is 26.77&quot; long, 764B is 22.56&quot; long. Which is correct, A or B,
for a 78?
Thanks
