X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

I am trying to address, in a general sense, some of
the questions on hard start relays and related items.
This will go on my site.
Any comments are welcome. See a mistake? Unclear?
  Thanks! Dan

Intermittent starting can be a result of an ageing
electrical system. As the
years go by connections corrode resulting in a higher
resistance. Switch 
contacts wear. Higher resistance. Single strand wire
fatigues at stress points
caused by vibration and or movement. Multi strand wire, by
design, will flex 
more and over time may lose individual strand continuity.
Higher resistance!
---Your electrical components, such as a starter assembly,
draws it's required
operating current via this electrical network. As
resistance goes up a higher
voltage potential is required to give the same amount of
current.
---A guy named George Ohm figured out this relationship
back in 1828. He came up
with this easy formula known as Ohm's Law.
I=V/R. Where &quot;I&quot;=current, &quot;V&quot;=Voltage, and &quot;R&quot;= resistance.
So you can see if resistance increases and voltage stays
the same, current will
drop. Conversly, if the voltage goes up and resistance
stays the same the 
current will increase.
---A common illustration of this is the &quot;dimmer switch&quot;
which varies the 
resistance of a circuit resulting in a brighter or dimmer
light. 
---All this being said, your battery has a MAX CURRENT
rating. You dont have
an infinate amount of current available in your system
because of this and 
the operational limitations of your alternator. Your stock
system is designed
around these limitations. As you add goodies to your bus
the system &quot;load&quot; value
increases. A heavy or big load electrically means a high
value of &quot;load current&quot;,
corresponding to a large amount of work supplied by the
source.
---Where high values of load current are required, a
lead-acid cell is the type
most commonly used. This is what your bus battery is. For
example the load 
current at starting is approx. 200 to 300 amps. One
lead-acid cell has an output
of 2 to 2.2V, but are generally used in a &quot;series&quot;
combination of 3 for a 6 volt
battery or6 for a 12 volt battery. As it is a &quot;storage
cell&quot;, charging can be
done over and over (your alternator) to restore voltage, as
long as the cell is
in good physical condition. Heat with excessive discharging
and charging, 
however, shortens the usefull life of a car battery to
about 3 years.
***Hooking up 2 or more batteries to get more power.
DO NOT HOOK UP BATTERIES IN SERIES! 
If you hook up two 12 volt batteries in series you will see
24 volts! 
This will be the case if you go from the neg. terminal of
one battery to 
the positive terminal of the second battery and hook up
your system to the 
free terminals on each battery.
HOOK THEM IN PARALLEL!!
&gt;From battery 1 to battery 2 hook the 2 postives together
and the 2 negatives
together.
#1(pos)0--------#2(pos)0-------0&lt;bus's postive cable 
&lt;br&gt;
#1(neg)0--------#2(neg)0-------0&lt;bus's negative(ground
strap)cable

---This will give you 12 volts and more current. I,
however, would advise that
you buy the commercial system that allows you to install
two batteries in your
bus as if you hook two batteries as shown and get a short
somewhere it will fry
the wireing in half the time it would have with one
battery. UNLESS you put a
in line circuit breaker. If you do this you will have to
install the &quot;hard start&quot;
relay for the starter, bypassing the circuit breaker for
the starter circuit.
Aint electronics fun!?

because he is not infected with the concept of what I &quot;should&quot; be doing.
