Subject: Re: [T2] The ideal VW motor replacement

A two-stroke horizontally opposed 2 cylinder 1810cc diesel engine.  It
almost looks similar...

The engine is water-cooled.  The goofy part is the fact is that it's
got two cylinders, four pistons and two crankshafts.  The crankshafts
are where you would expect the heads to be (there are no valves or
camshaft) and compression is achieved by the two pistons meeting in
the middle of the cylinder.  Intake ports are on one end of the
cylinder, exhaust ports on the other end.

Avtur/Jet-A1/Kerosene/#1 Fuel Oil/#1 Diesel are similar.  Diesel has a
lubricant added that Avtur/Jet-A1/Kerosene/#1 Fuel Oil is missing, so
I would assume there would be greater wear in the fuel system.
Perhaps the additional wear is not a big deal for an aviation engine
that needs to be torn down every 1000 hours.

&gt;         The site is a little odd in some ways  -  they're in no hurry
&gt; to tell how this engine is cooled, and I hadn't heard that Avtur (i.e
&gt; kerosene) will substitute for dieselene.
