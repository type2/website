Subject: Re: [T2] Re:grounding engine/trans


I have left this ground undone without ill effect on my '71.  As far as I
can tell, I was grounding through the CV joints as well as the clutch and
throttle cables.  Since all of these move/slide/etc. none of them are
reliable grounds.  When I noticed the ground strap hanging I said a bad
word and hooked it up right away.

&gt; &gt;     Then all you'd need for insurance is another ground wire piggied from
&gt; &gt; the battery negative to the engine?
&gt;
&gt; Yup, and I have seen this. It is not a bad test if you think this may be a
&gt; problem, but I prefer to do it as the factory did.  Extra wires make
&gt; pulling the engine more of a PITA than it usually is.  There is nothing
&gt; like discovering some extra PO-installed wire with the engine half way
&gt; down.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; BTW, didn't the &quot;brain&quot; (MPC) have its own ground wire?
&gt;
&gt; Yes it does, three of them as a matter of fact. but the &quot;feed&quot; for those
&gt; grounds are wires that connect to lugs the engine case under the intake
&gt; plenum. If the case is not grounded, the FI is not grounded.
