Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic clutch info for you

Very funny that I noticed a slot in my axle beam boss in the same location.
I wondered for about 15 seconds if this wasn't where the clutch cable was
supposed to go.  How did it ever get there, I wonder.  I wondered if this
was a lazy way to adjust the clutch cable after it had really stretched.
 
&gt; A couple of years back I noticed that the cable routing went through a
&gt; narrow slot on the backside of one of the big threaded inserts for the
&gt; front axle beam attach on the frame.  Closer inspection revealed that the
&gt; cable was _cutting_ through that boss after being misrouted on the wrong
&gt; side of the insert.  The clutch action had caused the cable to cut halfway
&gt; through the approximately 1 inch diameter solid steel insert!  It must
&gt; have been that way for decades, but the cable showed no wear at all.  I
&gt; rerouted the cable and the clutch action became much easier (it wasn't
&gt; hard to begin with) and &quot;slicker&quot;.  Before playing with hydraulics, take a
&gt; look at the clutch cable routing to see if the same error might have been
&gt; made on yours.
