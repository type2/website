&gt; I do not know of any electric and gas heaters combos. I have two space
&gt; heaters I will brag about. The first is a tiny Duracraft space heater about
&gt; 10 x 10 inches. It has a built in blower, 1500w and good for small spaces.
&gt; It is a ceramic heater, several years old (8 years?) from K-mart or
&gt; Wal-Mart or some place. Less than $30.

By accident, I found a good mini space heater.  The Wearever &quot;popcorn
pumper&quot; hot air popcorn poppers are 1400W, and if you take the clear
plastic widget off the top it blows hot air straight up.  We got a couple
for $5 at the Salvation Army.  We use them to pre-heat and defrost the
cars in the morning.  We've been using them for years and they seem to
be quite durable.
