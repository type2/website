&gt; The fact that this law was passed and signed in the first place shows 
&gt; a horrible lack of vision and compassion among our politicians. 
&gt; California's first job should have been the state's economy. Not 
&gt; messing with vehicle regulations. 
&gt; 
 Don't think for a minute that smog check isn't as much about $$$ as clean air. All those smog check stations spent all that money on equipment, so they want as many vehicles as possible forced to be &quot;smogged&quot;. Wouldn't surprise me a bit to learn that the auto repair industry lobbied for expanding the smog check program
When tighter standards take those &quot;dirty&quot; cars off the road, car makers and dealers will be happy to sell us new(er) ones. Even if you buy used from a private party, you still pay tax and title fees. 
It's a double bonus for the auto repair industry because people will be less likely to attempt to work on newer more complex cars.
