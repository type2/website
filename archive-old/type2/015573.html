 I use a non-migrating moly based grease

&gt;  I've been using a Copper-loaded
&gt;brake lubricant but it doesn't seem to last very well and always seems
&gt;to be gummy when I come to adjust.
&gt;

For the same reason I don't like anti-seize on threads. It gets gummy with
age and has to be cleaned out/off too often to maintain function. Why add
to the maintenance requirements with non-specified material?? There are a
lot of materials in the aftermarket sold as aids to brake assembly. Some of
the stuff for the back of pads will isure that the next time you try to
pull the pad, it will not come out. You must unmount the caliper. Then when
you force the pad away from the puck, the dust boot tears out with the pad.
I don't consider this an aid to brake service. Oh yeah, in most cases the
service was requested because the brakes were squeeking, the very problem
the material is advertised to prevent.
