Subject: RE: [T2] Oil Bath Air Filter hose

Max,

You should be OK to drive it a while. The tube vents the crankcase pressure
into the oil bath to create positive pressure if memory serves me right. You
might just belch a little oil into the engine compartment instead of venting
into the oil-bath. I am surprised you are using the stock system at all.
Most people ditch it in favor of a paper filter thinking it will help their
performance on a stock engine. It doesn't, so kudos for keeping it stock.

Subject: [T2] Oil Bath Air Filter hose

Hi all,

'71 1600dp

Quick question about the hose that connects to the bottom of the oil
bath air filter. During my engine swap on KK last weekend I lost the
metal tube that connects to the oil bath hose. Is that part necessary
or can I drive without it until a new one arrives. I have the hose
pointed at my engine bay door for right now.

Thank you,

Max
