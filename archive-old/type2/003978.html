 roll-on rubber stuff that
&gt;goes underneath asphalt roof shingles. i forget the brand name, but it's
&gt;pretty common.

I think you're probably describing what's called &quot;ice shield&quot; in these
northern parts.  Good idea, I'd like to know how that comes out.

Also, consider using a hot air paint stripping gun set on the low heat
setting (then be really careful about the tip and where you set it down.  A
ceramic  bowl or a clay flower pot is a good way) to soften the rubber.

Good luck.
