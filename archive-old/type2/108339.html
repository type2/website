Subject: Re: [T2] BB in vacuum line?

It didnt make much sense to me either. I didnt check to see if I still had
vacuum advance after I removed the BB. I did drive the bus and all seemed
OK. I will check tommorow.  What are the symptoms of a clogged charcoal
cannister if any? I guess that wouldnt have anything to do with the EEC
valve though right?

Thanks Karl

&gt; That would be kinda stupid to plug that line, unless the EEC purge valve
on the back of the air cleaner leaks.
&gt; If the valve leaks, you will not have vacuum advance. The valve is not
available separate. Only comes with the
&gt; air cleaner half. The valve opens when you accelerate and allows venturi
vacuum to suck the fumes out of the
&gt; charcoal cannister.
