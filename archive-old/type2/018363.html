Subject: When did rear hatch change?
Message-ID: &lt;37593484.5DA4498B_at_dds.nl&gt;

Hi everybody,

I heard that early baywindows have a different rear hatch than the later
types. The difference is in the point where the hinges are attached. Can
anybody tell me until which model year the old hatches were used?
