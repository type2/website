Subject: RE: [T2] 78 Champagne Edition Restoration...Thanks!!!

Seann,

Actually it was purchased at Autozone for about $20.  I cut
a groove out of the plastic ends so that when I glued it to the window it 
would not be touching the defrost wires.  I then drilled a small hole
in the frame just above it and put a small grommet in the hole.  Then ran 
the wires thru the back window frame and out the hole close to the hinge.

The wires now follow the defrost wire up under the headliner and then
down behind the wall bard on the passenger side...another very small hole
and grommet at the bottom corner gets you out within a few inches of the
wires for the right side brake lights and stuff.

All hidden and at least at the window level, looks like factory.

Glass glue will *not* work.  I ended up using my favorite black 3m
weatherstrip adhesive.  If I had done it before I put the back window
and new rubber in, I would have made a bracket and put it under/around 
some of the window rubber.


Sure makes me feel better about people &quot;seeing&quot; me stop.

Drawbacks...yes, if the fuse for the right side brake light goes out,
it won't work.  The addition of a couple of 10 cent diodes and wiring to 
the other side would fix that in the future.  It has it's own ground
wire back to a body ground, so that isn't an issue.

I also have a Jamie Rivers hitch to put on and have a &quot;hole&quot; cover
for the hitch with a brake light in it as well.  As soon as I put the
hitch on, I will have two extra brake lights.  If it makes it look
&quot;trashy&quot; at that point...well so be it....I have seen a guy in a freshly 
restored *black* 57 chevy with &quot;new&quot; bumpers on it get creamed cause the 
kid behind him didn't see him stop.  The guy had to be on it's maiden 
voyage because it looked so good.  Nobody hurt, except the car.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Noticed the third brake light?  yes
&gt; 
&gt; what did you pull it out of?  Did you run the wires down through the
&gt; headliner or into the corners of the door where the defrost lines
&gt; wire in?
