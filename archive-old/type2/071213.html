&lt;&lt; Does anyone have any info on this?

 &quot;...Last but not least will be a New Samba concept
 styled at VW's Simi
 Valley design studio in Southern California.
 Reportedly, this seven-passenger,
 multi-purpose vehicle with design cues taken from
 VW's venerable old microbus
 from the 1960s and '70s is meant to gauge public
 reaction to a possible new
 VW van/activity vehicle. We can't wait to weigh
 in....&quot;

I don't have any info, but I'd sure like to see it.
