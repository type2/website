&gt; My 82 Westy has had a problem where when you come to a stop it dies since

&gt; time.

so it sounds like everytime you get someone to mess with it the
problem goes away (at least for a short while). If I were you daniel I
would set aside some time this weekend w/ lots of cotton swabs,
electronic cleaner and a VOM. If just fooling with the problem
(especially replacing some elec parts) causes a temporary fix then It
might just be a bad connection somewhere? If nothing else it sure
can't hurt. especially look for the ground wires and the contact they
make. You can test connections w/ the VOM and get an idea. 

OTOH it could be a vacuum leak that tends to get seated when messing
w/ the engine but works its way loose. give it a shot.
