BBB IV in Lake Havasu City-AridZona  [Big Bus Bash] was a Blast--have a
lot of photos of REAL buses that are on the road!! Brian won the Uncle
Jerry Jess Award!! 5 days ago his bus was in the weeds for 16
years!--put it together and drove 250 miles- with expired 16 year old
tags- Police just let him go!--There just isn't anything like a VW Bus
Event--only saw one person actually polishing his bus!! Drive and
enjoy!! Do not concern yourself about $30,000 Buses--that is another
ballgame--Our game is driving--and Bessie with an unkown motor made it
there and back-- What more can i ask for?  Thanks LBB for a Vantastic 3
days--TWWM, uj
