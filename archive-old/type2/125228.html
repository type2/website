Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot Heads

Ron,
Sorry to chime in on this one BUT....

In my experience,
 AVP will not send out your core refund until you call and remind them.
Sometimes several times.

I had to send back 2 heads recently because they forgot to test the studs
and I had at least one on each head pull out. They admitted it was their
mistake.  I had to call and call and call to get my refund on the shipping
and had to park my bus while I waited and waited for the heads to come back.
On the 3rd head I had go bad, I finally told them no more and they agreed to
pay a local machine shop to fix the stud.  Which again the reimbursement
took way too long and I had to call again and again.

If you don't mind having to drop your engine several times and parking your
bus for undisclosed periods of time while waiting for replacements and you
have the extra $ that you don't mind spending on trying to get your heads
back to them and waiting for your refund.

Go ahead with AVP.

Just my experience and a warning.  And yes I did call Bus Depot when I had
all these problems and was told to call AVP direct, which is what I did.
