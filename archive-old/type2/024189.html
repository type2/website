I checked the posts but to no avail. I have a '79 standard consisting of a
dark brown lower half, a pumpkin-type orange above the beltline. I have done
some investigating and found too many answers. Could someone refer me to the
correct names of these colors? 

My driver's side window crank won't stay on the post because it is severely
stripped. Is there an easy fix or do I need a new regulator?
