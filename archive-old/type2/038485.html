&gt; &gt; A few things to consider:  These will be 15&quot; wheels, and require 15&quot;

&gt; &gt; load C or load D tire in that size is probably pretty slim.  Or move up to
&gt; 
&gt; Continental CT22 in a 205/65/15. A beautiful tire that I'll fit to my 6x15
&gt; Fuchs. They're reinforced and are rated at 99T (1706 lbs). I believe that's
&gt; what the Eurovans are wearing these days. But for a 205, I believe 6&quot; wheels
&gt; are a minimum.

ah! excellent.  And i agree, 6&quot; width is a minumum for 205's...7&quot; would
likely be better...but then, i'm looking for Z rated tires myself right
now.;) (ok, looking at...the dunlop sp8000 at 70 bucks each looks
tempting...but i might go with a cheaper tire...we'll see.;)

later...david
