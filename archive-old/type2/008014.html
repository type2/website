&gt;I'll test the power feed to the regulator again, what triggers the power to
the fuel regulator and when should &gt;it be on?  

Under normal operation, the solenoid winding on the regulator is energized
(valve open) while the heater is running, except when it is deactivated by
the temperature regulating switch on the hot air duct (when the desired heat
level is reached, the thermostat on the TRS activates a switch, cutting
current downstream to the pump and solenoid).  Otherwise, under abnormal
conditions such as overheating, the solenoid will be deactivated by the
over-heating switch (its contact points will open, breaking current flow to
the solenoid as well as the pump).  Also classified under abnormal
occurences, prolonged lack of combustion will cause the safety switch to cut
current to the solenoid and pump (as well as the motor and coil).  

&gt;I also replaced the diaphragm in the fuel pump with the same BUNA N
material I used in the regulator, was that &gt;appropriate ?

That the material is rated for fuel use is one consideration, others would
be thickness and heat rating.  On my heater, the original diaphragm pump
material was gray--the fuel pump material an orange color (the replacement
buna material I used for the pressure regulator was black).  A double layer
of material was used on the fuel pump (I'm not 100% positive this was
original--could've been a previous repair).  I have no specs for the true
thickness of a known original diaphragm, but I can say from experience that
this doubled up arrangement (each strip is the same thickness as the
regulator diaphragm) does work.  I'd say go by the thickness of the old
material you removed from the pump--buna should work just fine.
