&gt; The recommended tire size is listed as 205 - 70 - 14. But I put that
&gt; size on the front of my 73 and they rub when getting close to the
&gt; stops in either direction.  They're working fine on the back, however.
&gt; I got them because that size was MUCH cheaper in the higher load
&gt; ranges than a 185R14.
&gt;
&gt; Any comments? Where did that # come from? Maybe they work ok on different years?

I have a 78 and have been using 205/70 for over 10 years and have had no
trouble with rubbing front or rear.  I use Michelins (which unfortunately
are no longer avaliable)
