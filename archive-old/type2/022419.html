Subject: Rich mixture/Vacuum leaks
Mime-Version: 1.0

Volks-
	IF I had a small vacuum leak (without knowing about it) for the past year 
or so, and actually was able to adjust my carb and idle and all that, would 
fixing that vacuum leak now make me run too rich?
Today I was replacing some pretty ratty looking vacuum hoses for/from the 
brake booster and was wondering how some of them were able to create a good 
seal while I was using them. After I replaced them, my engine wants to 
stall out when I initially give it gas, kinda like a flat spot, but if I 
feather the gas, and it gets past that initial point, she runs fine. What's 
going on?
I have an 1800 T4 with the Webber Progressive (which I love).
Thanks,
	Joel
