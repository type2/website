&gt;hey volks,
&gt;picked my '77 transporter up today and after a hesitant start, she roared to
&gt;life for the first time in 4 years...with old gas I gave her some carb
&gt;cleaner, and ultimate gas...started again, and drove on home, about 8
&gt;miles...ran most electric off and on the ride home to check to see if it
&gt;still worked...anyways. when going to turn it on again, the engine turns
&gt;over very slowly....tried to
&gt;jump start it and the extra juice didn't make any change..
&gt;its possible the alternator is bad or vibrated loose a connection, anyone
&gt;know if a bad voltage regulator would cause battery drain?

4 years of non use can lead to several problems, depending much on ambient
humidity during period of sitting.

1. Drain all the old gas from the tank. Fill with fresh. Change the fuel
filter.

2. Fully charge then load test the battery. Replace if required.

3. Test charging specs. If the regulator or alturnator shows problems,
replace as required.

Expect possible problems with fuel hoses, injector spray pattern, and flush
the brake fluid and check closely for leaks. Does it go without saying???
Change the oil and filter before further running.
