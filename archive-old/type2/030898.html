&gt; Thought I'd jump in with my own oil pressure uniquity.  Last weekend I
&gt; installed a VDO dual oil pressure sender and VDO oil pressure guage.  I
&gt; installed the sender on a 6&quot; brass nipple from the local plumbing store,
&gt; such that the sender towers above the block, just above the distributor

I use a similar system, using a 3 in pipe and 90degree angle it is tight
fit but it is down below the distributor

&gt; (I have a '78 2.0L engine).  The rubber boot fits nicely around the
&gt; nipple.  But to the point.  My oil pressure guage reads 60-80 psi. for
&gt; the first five to 10 minutes the engine is running.  Then it drops to
&gt; the 20-40 psi. range and stays.  I can't decide if I have a bad sender
&gt; or if my installation is causing the high readings.

I had lower readings until I put in my newly rebuilt engine with new oil
pump, now I get similar readings as you get.  I think you may just have a
good oil pump ;8*} ????? (same oil sender)
