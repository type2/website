Hi Karl,

If you like, contact me by email off of the list and I will scan and send you
copies of my source materials.

Keep smiling,

Mike

&gt; Mike,
&gt; How many times do you need to be corrected for this false info??
&gt; A vacuum advance uses PORTED vacuum. PORTED vacuum comes from ABOVE the
&gt; throttle plate. The MORE you open the throttle, the MORE vacuum you have.
&gt; PORTED vacuum comes off the venturi.
&gt; If you are full throttle and you have zero vacuum, you better check your
&gt; tach. You seized your engine and you have no air flow into the engine.
&gt; Go back to Auto Mech 101.
