&gt; &gt;Barring unforeseen
&gt; &gt; circumstances, red tape, mountain traffic jams and that sort of thing, I
&gt; &gt; would give yourself at least a full 2 days for the drive (including time to
&gt; &gt; enjoy the beauty of the land
&gt; 
I've never gone the entire way to Guadalajara, but I do know that Navojoa
is one full day's drive from Tucson, and Mazatlan is one more day from
Navojoa.  Mexico is _not_ the place to try and maintain a tight schedule!
