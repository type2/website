&gt; &gt; it was death for a 1600 dp. 
&gt; 
&gt; Death?  A little extreme, I would say.
&gt; 
&gt; do you have a stock-style muffler?  Single tailpipe off to the driver
&gt; side, blah blah?  Or an aftermarket extractor?  Or Pon-forbid! A bug
&gt; muffler?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyhow.  If you have a Liestriz (yes, I spelled it wrong.:) stock
muffler,
&gt; it will be vvery obvious which is which, since the tubes on these are
&gt; correctly built.
&gt; 
&gt; One side has a tube that sorta points TOWARD the engine, (that is,
inside
&gt; the exhaust work...) and that end is getting the exhaust.  The other
end
&gt; leads to the expansion chamber of the exhaust system, and exists
there.
&gt; High pressure at one end, low at the other, allows the exhaust to
travel
&gt; correctly.
&gt; 
&gt; George Lyle...you have one laying around, right? Take a look, tell us
&gt; which end has the small hole in the top, and which has the large hole?

Right side connects directly to the header pipe.  Left side connects
to a long piece of tubing that ends up just in front of the muffler
outlet after passing through the wall of the muffler canister.

Although the hole in the left side is smaller, it is nowhere near as
small as the holes in the &quot;small hole&quot; gasket.

In my opinion, you should run only the large hole gaskets.  I seem to
recall there being a logical explantion for this written in one manual
or another, but not what it was!  In any case, you want to keep the
manifold warm, so don't restrict the flow of gases.
