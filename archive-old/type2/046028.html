Subject: [T2] 75 Tranny ?'s and 66 SC Tilt ?'s

Ronnie
    Need to do something about the trannie for my 72 Westie with a 75 1800 T
IV.  I believe that it was a freeway flier?  Would I be better off sending
to get rebuilt or try to find someone here in Omaha?  I know nothing about
trannies and frankly they scare me!!  Where would you go for rebuild or
transplant?  I'll do the work (OK my 14 year old son will).
Also still looking for detailed dimensions for the hoops and tilt(canvas) so
I can make my own at home.  Never took a look at the ones that I have seen
and don't understand how the canvas attaches to the hoops?  I figure that it
has little belts that hook into the side of the gates of the single cab?
Found a couple pictures in the back of the Bentley and that confused me more
as it shows that a strip of metal is welded on top of the hoops and it looks
like the canvas slips onto these strips?  I don't get it!!  How does the
canvas attach to the hoops?   Thanks?!
