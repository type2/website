Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line replacement - won't start!

Billy,

Hate to mention it(don't ask how I know)...did you pinch off the fuel line
near the tank to replace other lines and forget to take pinch device off?

The basics.....

Spark?   at the right time?
Air?
Fuel?

Reconnected cold start injector?
Reconnected temp sensor.....this is the usual biggee!

Cheers, dave

&gt; list, for my fuel line job I did the following:
&gt; 
&gt; changed all fuel lines
&gt; 
&gt; new filter
&gt; 
&gt; pulled all injectors, used one new smaller seal on #3 as I lost the original (borg-warner)
&gt; 
&gt; pulled 3/4 intake runner (had to fix sheared stud)
&gt; 
&gt; disconnect main f.i. plug (gently to get to fuel ring)
&gt; 
&gt; disconnected airbox &amp; wiring (above)
&gt; 
&gt; everything is back in it's correct place. cranks but won't start.
&gt; 
&gt; going out now to get a fuel pressure gauge to test my work properly, starting with the pump.
&gt; 
&gt; can anybody throw out some advice, places to start?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
