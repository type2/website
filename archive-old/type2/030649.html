I doubt it's the fork:  when the fork broke, I was unable to release the
clutch, now it doesnt have enough pressure to keep from slipping. (abd I
have a half pedal of free play..hmm..)

&gt; enough bend in the cable housing, maybe binding on the clevis. What

It was dark, so I havent investigated the bowden tube and clamp, but if I
make it to work in the morning, I'll be checking it over well.

&gt; exactly was wrong with the old pplate?

Which one?:(  the first plate, replaced maybe 10k miles before I bought
the bus, (according to reciepts) broke the little &quot;thing&quot; that holds the
throwout-riding-ring to the fingers of the plate.  This caused all sorts
of havoc...(i had ~20k on the bus at this time, not sure.  Could look it
up in my book..)

the second one broke sometime this summer.  After the fork broke.  This
one I was able to press ~3/4's of the springs by hand, with ease.  No
pressure.

&gt; You do have all the right style parts matched up, right? (pplate, t-o
&gt; bearing, trans sleeve or none)

*nod*  No sleeve, ring on the PP, round ears on the TB...

&gt; I'm not sure of the answer, but defective Sachs parts is WAY down on my
&gt; list.

It'd only be my third, so it wouldn't surprise me in the least.

Ah well.

thanks...david
