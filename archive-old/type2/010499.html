There is a 1977 Westfalia at Burnsville VW for sale at 
$6995.  It is green and almost perfect in and out.  There 
number is 612-894-3500.

There are the remains of a 1973 Westry and 1977 bus at U-
Pull-R-Parts in Rosemount.  The Westy is 90% stripped 
inside but still has engine, turns with a wrench, 
alternator, and under body stuff but no transmission.  The 
bus is about 70% stripped inside but still has the under 
stuff like the Westy.  Don't have their number.

I found these when I went lokking for a tail light for a 
friend's '91 Grand Prix.  I've been there three time 
looking for that and came out three times with things for 
the Westy instead!
