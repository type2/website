 Gentlepersons-
                        Not to be too negative. but I strongly suspect that 
VW 
 is only inter-
 ested in selling new VW's. Proof positive; quick poll, how many aircooled 
 owners have
 had a &quot;positive&quot; experience at their local VW dealers...with service/parts?

actually, I bought new rear torsion bar rubber bushings at my local Oly 
dealership, Hansen VW.  I had a part number- I went in and they looked it up, 
but their records did not go back that far, they had the bay window version, 
the number of the part was superceded.  I left and found out the the bay 
version fits the split, so went back, and I had to order them  ($32 for 4) 
and they arrived less than a week later.   The parts people were friendly and 
helpful.  Approaching  the parts guy with specifics probably helped.  Perhaps 
driving up in a SHINY splitscreen bus helped, as opposed to a ratty one.  I 
have also gone into old dealerships looking for old stash, and had the rude 
&quot;it's all gone treatment&quot;.  I've also borrowed parts list from a dealership, 
to photocopy, but the friend I went with was the son of someone who had 
previously  worked there for years.  So I guess it all depends.  A guy I know 
who is into old motocycles was amazed at how much aftermarket stuff there is 
for ACVWs, cause what he could get for the bikes was virtually all through 
dealers and cost were higher.  I still don't understand why some people think 
I would be excited about the 'new bus' or new beetle', they are just new 
cars,  so what.  I don't understand why VWAG has an aggressive attitude 
towards old VWs/ repro part makers for them- it is a market they abandoned 
ages ago, so why not let someone else fill it?
