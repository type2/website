We do not use silicone as a lubricant, or sealant....The best thing is
Teflon paste, made for pipe thread fittings, it is near perfect and will
keep them dry....

&gt; I use a spark plug socket on a short extension to seat the push rod tubes,
&gt; putting a little clear silicone lubricant to help them go. When it is
almost
&gt; there, I take a look at the seal in the head...half the time it needs a
&gt; little tweaking with a small screwdriver like Stan said.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Take a pair of channel lock pliers and brace them against the engine
&gt; &gt; block and pull your tubes out.
&gt; &gt; After  you get them out they may be a little bit crushed. Take a 3/8&quot;
&gt; &gt; extension with a proper sized socket on the end and drive it through the
&gt; &gt; tube to get the compression out. Examine the ends of the tube and make
&gt; &gt; sure that they are in good  shape.
&gt; &gt; When you put the new O rings on they will hang going into the head. Use
a
&gt; &gt; screwdriver to push the top portion of the O ring down and it will slip
&gt; &gt; right in. Use oil on the O rings to make them go in easier. I use a 15mm
&gt; &gt; socket on an extension to give me control over the angle and guide the
&gt; &gt; tube in.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Clean all residue of silicone, dirt, grease out of the O ring seating
&gt; &gt; areas on both the head and the block.
&gt; &gt; O rings don't need any other sealer if they are on a clean mating
&gt; &gt; surface. They could leak a little for the first fifteen minutes that you
&gt; &gt; run your engine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Is it just stuck or am I missing a step or
