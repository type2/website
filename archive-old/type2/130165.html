Gang,

An update to my endeavors.  Well my baby is back together.  I think the
hardest part was positioning the shroud so I could get the generator
our.  I also ran into a snag when I lost,  then found that small locking
pin (I guess you would call it)  that hold the pulley to the generator.
I was on my hands an knees with my shop light looking for this small
piece of metal.  My wife came in saw me and said I guess your busy and
went back into the house.  So I got it all together and the battery is
charging now.  I also was able to change my CV Boots (Left rear) and my
right rear heat exchange box.  Next pay day it'll be the left side then
onto the other smaller projects.  I've learned allot this past month
working on my bus.  Its fun and since my bus is my primary means of
travel, its necessary.


Thanks for all your help


Stay on the Bus....

 Michael....
