Subject: my dilemma

Hey everybody,

I have a dilemma that I'd love to hear some opinions about.

I currently have:

-73 sunroof bus - decent shape, pretty straight, strong engine, everything
works well

-71 westfalia - newly rebuilt 1600 engine, very rough interior (PO's dog
chewed everything up) except the cabinets are still nice, needs steering and
brake piston repairs.

-complete riviera poptop including excellent canvas

-a wife and 2 young children who want to go camping.

-$500 worth of parts from a local boneyard in exchange for helping him sell
a 87 westfalia quickly ($8500 steal if anyone is interested).


I'd love to keep both vehicles, but finances require that I keep only one.
The riviera poptop would provide better sleeping arrangements for the family
than the westfalia poptop.

The options I'm considering are:

-keep the '71 and replace the existing poptop with the riviera poptop.
-keep the '73 and convert it to a &quot;west-viera&quot;.

I need to be able to sell the remaining vehicle for more rather than less.

Any thoughts?  Obviously there are mechanical differences between the
vehicles to take into account as well.

Thanks,

Brian
