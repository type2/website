&gt;&gt;I'am worried about a similiar problem.  My 77 transporter cuts of for
days.
&gt;&gt;Then response to my attempts
&gt;&gt;to eliminate possible causes by running for days . Then cuts out again.
&gt;This
&gt;&gt;has happened 4 times . I'am also feeling quite insecure. The first time 4
&gt;or
&gt;&gt;5 months ago I cleaned and tightened all the grounds. After 2 days of
&gt;&gt;cleaning and fiddling she suddenly started and ran the 4 or 5 months with
&gt;no
&gt;&gt;problem. Two weeks ago she wouldn't start one morning. Would crank, but
not
&gt;&gt;start. would fire for 2 or 3 secounds and they die. New coil
&gt;&gt;cleaned all the grounds again, disconnected cold start valve leads. And
she
&gt;&gt;started up and ran for 3 or 4 days
&gt;&gt;maybe 10 to 15 start ups. But this time she wouldn't idle smoothly
&gt;&gt;immediately , had to rev her for a while  before she'd smooth out and not
&gt;&gt;die on me.  But she ran for a couple of days maybe 8 to 12 starts with
&gt;&gt;initial rough idle then run fine . Then again she wouldn't start. Cleaned
&gt;&gt;all air hoses and vacuum tubes. Air sensor  resistance with in bounds,
&gt;&gt;tempeture sensor resistance 1800 instead of 2500 ordered new one. Can't do
&gt;&gt;any test that requires the engine to be running or warm etc. I'am baffled.
&gt;&gt;Do you think the resistor ballast or the fuel pump relays (are they the
&gt;same
&gt;&gt;as the double relay?) might be the source of this INTERMITTENT problem .?
