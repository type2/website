Subject: Re: [T2] Bizarre braking

&gt; Last fall I did the complete brake job on my '70 bus, but starting in
the winter I had some braking problems.  Occasionally, the bus would
pull violently to the left when I braked.


This can be a sticking caliper due to the collapsed rubber hose acting as
a one way valve


&gt;  Plus, I lost some brake fluid, though I could not find any leak, but
then the fluid stayed level for a long time.  The braking continues to
act up intermittently.   I'm at wits end.  Any thoughts?


Loss of brake fluid with no outward signs could be the master cylinder
leaking into the booster, Loosen the master off at the booster, and see if
any fluid drools out ... you may have to pull it back enough to get you
finger in there to see if there is a puddle ...
