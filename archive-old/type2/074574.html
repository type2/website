Hi Grant,

I believe if you cut open a new one you will find that the volatile fluid is
plain old isopropynol (rubbing alcohol), which with its boiling point of
~175 degrees F is just about right.

Or I could be wrong, which would not cause me to throw a tantrum. I'm
usually wrong anyway. Marriage taught me that. It is bachelors causing all
the trouble around here. =^ )

&gt; Sean, there's a volatile fluid like freon in them that contracts greatly in
&gt; response to the cool temperatures, which is why they look like limp
&gt; accordions when they go bad.  Nature abhors a vacuum.
&gt; 
&gt; Is everyone in a bad mood, or what?
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Grant
