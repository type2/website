You think that is bad? Wait until you start getting
pissed because your 20 y/o neighbors are throwing a
party that 5 years earlier YOU would have been
hosting. And now you are the one calling the cops
because your child is trying to sleep and you have to
be at work at 8 AM.

Wait... you still have 3 more years before that
stage... my bad.

Welcome to adulthood my friend. The water it warm, and
the girls all wear one piece bathing suits.
