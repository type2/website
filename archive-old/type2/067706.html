Subject: oh no! Parts Place on the list!!!!

&gt;I totally forgot about checking the price on that....sorry... I'll find it ne
&gt;time I go in (Aisle 54, Row 2, Shelf 6) and get the price... If you're in a
&gt;hurry you can give me a call at work (810)373-2300 and I'll look it up right
&gt;away, if I'm not there you can ask for Glen, who is the biggest bus freak
&gt;I know...

ack ack ack ack! parts place is on the list! ack ack ack! don't order from
them unless you got the time and patience to put up with messed up orders.
probably one of the worst vw parts places to deal with as far as customer
service and accuracy in filling orders.

i ordered 1 one ONE halfshaft for my '74 from them last year. note: ONE. for
a '74. a '74. they sent me 2 two TWO vanagon halfshafts. and charged my
debit card (note: i'll never use a debit card to order anything over the
phone again!) something like $250 more then they were supposed to.

of course when i called they couldn't do anything to fix the situation until
i got them the wrong halfshafts back. which took about a week. then they
shipped the right part to me. but they have up to 30 days to give you the
money back. and they took about 2 weeks to credit my debit card back. well,
i had just enough money for that one ONE '74 halfshaft that particular week.
guess what? i bounced my first check that week.

i was polite during my many calls to parts place. but they didn't seem to care
about my buisiness there and customer service actually was rude a couple of
times. i'll never do buisiness with them again. a totally bad experience.

now, i understand that any buisiness can mess up an order. but the i'm not
the only one on this list to have trouble with parts place. many have.

i'll stick with RMMW or Bus Boys. Parts Place just ain't worth the hassle.
