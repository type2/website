Another fantastic thing in PA to see is the famous &quot;Falling Water&quot; and
&quot;Kentucky Knob&quot; of our (Americas) foremost architect Frank Lloyd Wright... its
NE of Pittsburg. DON'T MISS IT.

Theres also Presque Isle... north of Erie

And Chautauqua Institute on the shores of Lake Chautauqua in the Western
Corner of New York State... very beautiful old homes... and the Worlds Largest
Outdoor Pipe Organ... recently renovated
