Subject: save the bays! stickers

Though I do hold the title of Royal Loyal Choral Amoral Ambassador to the Central Valley, I am not the source of stickers.

Listmember Mike Visket and his cronies are the source, and are friendly/courteous mailers of stickers. I promised to send them some money for my stickers and didn't. That's how great they are!

Once you have stickers, you can also declare yourself a member with any title you chose, or select to have one bestowed upon you.

Where are you guys?

Savethebays_dot_org?

Billy
