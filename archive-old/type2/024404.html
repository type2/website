&gt;Why are manuals not popular - well it seems people are too busy in their

I couldn't agree more.

&gt;We had our first storm this week with about a foot of snow overnight.

We just had our first winter weather in Portland. Well they call it winter
here. It's nothing like the Midwest or Montana, where I came from. 
I wouldn't want to drive anything other than a manual in the snow, and for
an inexperienced winter driver I wouldn't recommend anything else. One of
the key elements of safe winter driving is to avoid sudden actions, ie.
sudden braking. If one can, they should avoid braking by using the braking
effect of their own engine to stop; shift down, take your foot off the gas,
and let the engine do the work. 
When starting off, don't just gas it thinking power is going to get you
moving. You'll just spin your tires. Gently step on the gas. I've even found
starting off in second gear helps in really slippery situations.
My Golf with 5-speed transmission is a pretty good snow car. The bus isn't
bad either, but maybe too big and light. I have fond memories of my '65
Beetle aka &quot;The Winter Assault Vehicle&quot; The Beetle with studded tires had
excellent traction. Once when I was forced off the road into a snowbank, I
just put the car into first gear and let the clutch out. With the wheels
spinning, I got out of the car and pushed myself out. Then quickly hopped
back into the Bug.
