Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Child cot brackets which way?

&gt; I'm trying to add a front child's cot to an Adventurewagen 
&gt; and need some help with placement. I got a later style cot 
&gt; from Bus Depot and need to get some good measurements for 
&gt; where to drill the holes for the brackets. Thanks.


It's going to be risky to do it that way. The precise height of the
brackets varied on different Westy years, and since the pillar is
tapered, this means that the precise length of the poles differed too.
Therefore you may get varying measurements depending on the year of the
Westy the person has, only one of which will be correct for your
particular poles (since the aftermarket cot poles only come in a single
length). It's best to do your own measurement. Simply get someone to
help you hold the cot in place, slide it up and down on the pillars
until you find the place where the poles fit snugly (allowing for the
brackets), and that's where the brackets go. You might want to
double-check by temporarily afixing the brackets to the spots where you
think they should go with duct tape or packing tape and making sure
everything lines up perfectly before actually drilling. (Support the cot
so its weight doesn't just pull the taped brackets off.)
