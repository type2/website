Hi all,

this might sound like an odd request, but here goes anyway:

Can someone provide me with the dimensions (height, width and length) of a 
late model Type 2 Deluxe Transporter?

My 1978 bus is locked up at my mechanics for the weekend, and my technical 
manuals are in it.  I'm planning to bring it home on Monday for an engine 
drop to replace the cylinder heads.  I have very limited workspace since the 
P.O. of my house shortened the garage to make room for a basement apartment. 
  The driveway is short and sloped, so I need to make careful measurements 
to ensure that the rear end of my bus will fit in the garage while on 
stands.

I'ved looked all of over the Internet but I can't find these specs.  Anyone 
got a link they can share?

TIA,
Kendrew Pape
1978 Transporter - 'Buster'
