Subject: Re: [T2] Guages? What to buy???

&gt; that I assumed were conflicting. The first is.. I was under the impression
&gt; that you measure the temperature of the air cooler motor by the temperature
&gt; of the oil, correct? Well on BUS DEPOT they seel a &quot;Cyl Head Temperature
&gt; Sensor&quot; which measures the temperature of the cyl head. What's the
&gt; difference? Do I need both?

This can be a religious discussion - but the general attitude is that oil temp
is the most important. Head temp, especially if you get  both heads, can be
useful for preventive maintenance and closer monitoring of the engine
conditions.


&gt; has the fuel guage in it. However, the fuel guage is not working apparently
&gt; because when I turn my hazards on.. the needle jumps around like crazy. The
&gt; next guage on the right is a digital LED VDO fuel guage.. I'm assuming this
&gt; didn't come factory in a 1973 Bus. I don't see a tachometer.  Can someone
&gt; tell me what guages I should have?

Yep. The PO must have put in the VDA fuel guage. Parts can be had for the
factory gauge and it sounds like you might just have a ground problem.
Personally, I've never seen a bad fuel gauge in the dash (but I'm not that
experienced) whereas I've seen a few bad senders on the tank. To get to the
send, you essentially have to drop the engine and remove the tank. There is
another way - cut a hole in the bed of the bus just about the sending unit.
Worked great for me - but if you don't want to molest your bus that way,
taking he engine and tank out is the only way to go.

&gt; Also.. I like to watch my guages like a hawk... what guages SHOULD I have
&gt; for this motor? I don't think I need a fuel pressure guage, or a vacuum
&gt; guage. I would LIKE to have a guage displaying the voltage, an oil pressure
&gt; guage, fuel guage, tachometer, speedometer, and the oil temperature guage.
&gt; What else would I need to ensure that the car is running within it's
&gt; tolerable limits?

A tach is nice. You can get the VDO tach and an adapter to mount in the space
tot the right of the speedo (where the factory clock would go). Other than
that, oil temp, voltage and/or current, and oil pressure - in that order - are
relatively easy. I ran four wires from the engine compartment to the dash when
I installed my tach and oil temp. This way I can add oil pressure and
something else without the hard part.
