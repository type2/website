Subject: Re: Fan motors

Is there a picture somewhere I can look at?
I have a LOT of parts that will be going on the block very soon.
Including dual carbs and pipes for a '72 bus.
I have a fan but I don't know where it goes.
It's &quot;S&quot; shaped with flappers in both ends.

&gt; &gt; gone the way of the buffalo?
