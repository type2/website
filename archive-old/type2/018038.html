The adventure begins...I was pretty well convinced that I had to loosen
the tank hold-down straps in order to move the tank around enough to get
the fuel sender out. The first strap came out fine. The second...well,
here's what I'd do next time:

Attach a needle-nose ViceGrip to the base of the hold-down strap, such
that if the nut is rusted to the bolt, the strap will not turn
clockwise.

Go under the bus with a 13mm deep wall socket and remove the hold-down
nut (it's hidden inside a funky structural member thingy).

As it turns out, I managed to literally screw up the hold-down strap
until it broke from metal fatigue. Oh well, a good excuse to meet the
guys at Roscoe's salvage.

(Somebody enlighten me--is the rear of the strap bolted on, or [God
forbid], spot-welded?)
