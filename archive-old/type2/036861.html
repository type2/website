Subject: Re: [Short pushrods, or Weak Hyd. Lifters]

Matt,
If this was originally a solid lift engine (which it was), the original
pushrods are solid lifter rods and they are different from hyd pushrods - i
think hyd pushrods are made of steel rather than aluminum and may be longer,
but not sure.

If Hyd pushrods are longer, you have your solution.  If they're the same
length, something is extremely wierd- did you remember to install the cam?  
Thatsa joke.

The problem you're describing is hard to produce without something being
really screwy - like the hyd lifters not being VW or there being some big 1&quot;
shim under the cylinders.  

I think you have the wrong pushrods. 3/4&quot; is a lot.

&gt; Hello everybody,
but it seems 
&gt; that the pushrods aren't quite long enough. The rockers are on right, and 
&gt; everything else fits perfect, it just seems that the rods need to be about 
&gt; 3/4&quot; longer. They are new rods, and have been compared to the old ones and 
&gt; are the exact same length.
&gt; Thanks 
&gt;   Matt O.
