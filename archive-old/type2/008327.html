&gt;I've got a new one for you all, when was the last time you checked
&gt;your accel-cable travel vs. your carbs linkage-travel?
&gt;


Today as a matter of fact. Also discovered that cable was holding on to carb
by its last strand. Was on the road when I made the discovery but I had a
speare :)

I do this check occasionly since it has bitten me before and I ALWAYS carry
a spare clutch and throttle cable in the buses.
