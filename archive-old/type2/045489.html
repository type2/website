&gt; Rusty, I've driven a t-4 1700 with less than 100 compression for months
&gt;  with no catastrophic failure..._dot_depends on your driving habits. If you
&gt;  always have your foot to the floor, GET A V-8 CHEVY! 

The &quot;deliberate&quot; acceleration of the early Vanagon, like that of the Bus, is 
part of its charm. . .

Don't ruin a VW 2L
&gt;  van further.If you, like some of us drivers, believe in letting the
&gt;  vehicle live, as in easy does it, you may have a few thousand miles left
&gt;  on that motor. Obviously the po didn't take care of it so well, as the
&gt;  Vanagon could get between 125 and 160k miles between rebuilds, if cared
&gt;  for. The VW 2.0L engine is a very strong powerplant, but there a few
&gt;  things you may want to consider:
&gt;  1. It is an AIR-COOLED engine,so it runs hotter than your average water
&gt;  boiler, hence the need for restraint(unless you have TONS of disposable
&gt;  incone)when driving.

I'll nitpick here -- the operating temperature of an air-cooled engine is a 
bit higher by design, as it's not limited by the boiling point of pressurized 
water/glycol mix.  However, unlike most water-cooled engines, the T4 in a Van 
or Bus is working at the limits of its cooling system.  So, as you noted, a 
lead foot, hot weather, and/or poor maintenance can push it past those limits 
with expensive consequences.

&gt;  2. You are pushing an almost 2 ton vehicle with around 85 hp. Thats it,
&gt;  period.

I thought the 2.0L was only rated at 67HP.  I'll have to change the sign in 
my back window (&quot;2 Tons / 67 HP / Just Go Around&quot;) 

&gt;  3. the only OTHER cooling medium you have is OIL, so you must keep it
&gt;  up, but not over. 

I know that overfilling the oil is bad, but what sort of damage does it cause?

&gt;  AWAYS check your own oil!
&gt;  4.  Sit back and enjoy the ride.  The VW VAN was built so people could
&gt;  enjoy the ride, not to get there in a hurry so we can start to have some
&gt;  fun REAL QUICK!!! 
&gt;  
&gt;  I'll get off my soap box for now. I hope you don't get mad at me for
&gt;  lecturing of VW VAN etiquette, as there are some folks in the VW VAN
&gt;  community that think a VAN should be driven like a chevy!

Chevy makes perfectly good vans, as do the other &quot;Big 2 1/2&quot; US automakers.
I prefer my Westy.

&gt;  To each his
&gt;  own. But you must consider the fact that you are more likely to see more
&gt;  of the country at 55-60 mph than at 75, and to enjoy the ride more. THE
&gt;  RIDE'S THE THING.

Vanagons are a bit too much for an air-cooled 4-cylinder engine to push 
_easily_.  Hence, the WBX and the inline engines, not to mention the non-VW 
engine swaps.    The 2-liter T4 is perfectly adequate for relaxed cruising 
and in-town driving, but marginal on 75 MPH interstates.  So, I keep to the 
backroads when I can -- and ride my motorcycle when speed is of the essence.

&gt;  My .021/2.
