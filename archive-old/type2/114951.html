&gt; We have a 72 bus and are using the original 72 tranny, but are putting a 74

&gt; newer yaer because the engine is bigger but will that work with the 72
&gt; tranny. Or should we keep the same starter.  thanks

Is it a later 2.0L or a 1.8L from 74/75?

There are two starters and they are matched to the bellhousings:

002 case
  68-71 200mm 1600cc
  72-73 210mm 1.7L
  74-75 215mm 1.8L

091 case
  76-79 228mm 2.0L

You can see that although the case is compatible with the starter you want
to put in, you are using a clutch/pressure-plate that is wimpier than what
the factory installed. If you are using a 2L engine, then that flywheel
won't even fit the older bellhousing.

Search the archives to see what people have to say about using a smaller
clutch with a 1.8L engine.

FYI.
