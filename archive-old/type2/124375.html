Subject: Re: Engine downgrades

Don and the List,

Yes, it is very possible to do an engine downgrade.  I'm planning the very
same thing on my '72.  In Europe, the 1600 continued to be an option through
1979.  I got the correct factory tin and rear engine carrier ( &quot;bearer bar&quot;)
from Just Kampers in England.  I'm thinking if my 1600 doesn't have enough
power to suit me, I might build a 2 liter stroker motor with one of the new
aluminum cases that are available.  It should still be cheaper than a type 4
motor, and besides, I'm familiar with the type I motor.  With the 1600 in my
'72 there should be more room to get at the spark plugs, another little
bonus.

Good luck,

Rob
