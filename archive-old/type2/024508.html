OK maybe it is not quite that bad but now that I have solved the oil drips
on my 78 Westy, I need to clean up a years worth of accumulated small drips
on the concrete.  I went to my FLAPS and they did not have a concrete
cleaner.  I tried some Castrol super cleaner upper (purple stuff).  It
didn't work.  I went to Home Depot and they had a concrete cleaner from
Safety Clean that was environmentally friendly.  I hoped it would do the
job but I was skeptical as most &quot;GREEN&quot; products I have used in the past
don't work as well as their toxic counterparts.  I did very little.  What
do other people use to clean the oil stains off of concrete?


Thanks,
Graham
