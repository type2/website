Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding door question

&lt;&lt; Mike Jackson says about WD-40 &gt;&gt;
&gt;Actually, it's good for getting pine sap off of your hands, too.

Thanks for the tip on the pine sap - I didn't know that one.  But what're
the neighbors going to think when I start lubing my CAT with the stuff
because he's been climbing the pine trees again?  :)

BTW, WD-40 FREEZES when it's really cold.  I don't know what the freezing
point is, but we were at -20 the other morning and the garage door wouldn't
close so I tried to give it a zap with WD.  Sprayed for about 3 seconds
before it froze and quit spraying.  That stuff is water-based, isn't it?
