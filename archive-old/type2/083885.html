Subject: Webber Progressive pics

My father and I are trying to get my bus, a '74 1.8l with a Webber
Progressive carb, tunedproperly. I've been having problems with the choke 'sticking' in cold
weather. Everytimewe adjust the idle down the engine dies. My father seems to think there
may be a vacuum leak.While he has significant amounts of knowledge about automotive mechanics,
he hasn't dealtwith this carb in a bus (or really any bus) before. I've only had the bus
for a couple months andthe engine was rebuilt just before I got it (I helped put it back in). But
somewhere down theroad, the correct configuration of the carb seems to have been lost (along
with the title tothe bus).

The title is being fixed and now I'm working on the carb. Does anyone have
anypictures of a 1.8l with a webber prog PROPERLY setup? It would be VERY
helpful. Diagramswould be cool too. The Bentley and Muir books are useless here. I almost
bought a book onwebber carbs at the FLAPS but decided to hold off as it seemed geared towards
performance.
