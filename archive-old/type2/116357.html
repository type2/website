Subject: Rear Safari Window

The rear safari windows are available from Wolfgang Int'l.  Very cool, but
they certainly aren't giving these things away..

I'm also super interested in that Safari window ! Anyone know where to
get one ?
That would be awesome on my Safare !

I think that bus is going to sell with no problem, if only I was in the
area and not banned from buying more vw's &lt;grin&gt;

&gt; First where did you
&gt; find the rear Safari window for the Bays.
