Subject: Local  '78 Westy f/s

I went and looked at a RUST FREE westy here in town, Merced CA.

$3800 great body-orig paint

Interior good, not great. 

Has fridge,cot... all the bells and whistles

recent rebuild,almost new good tires.

I can store it here for someone until convient to come get it.             
            (Ask K. Hooper how liberal my storage policy is)

I'll have to go back and get the guys phone number again
Mark, is all I remember (English chap)

pmail me if you are hot for it.



2nd nicest guy in the world selling it, I think  *no job*  forces the sale
