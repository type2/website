Subject: Re: spark plug wire #4

Sharon sez:

&gt; When I pull the spark plug wire off of #4 it doesn't seem to affect the
&gt; engine. No noticeable drop in engine noise.

Could mean:

a) #4 isn't firing - running on 3 cylinders.
b) #4 has such low compression, it's not contributing much to the overall
power of the motor.
c) Engine isn't running (Hehehe, just had to get that one in!).

Take the plug out of #4, attach the plug wire, hold the electrode finger to
a good ground on the motor somewhere, and have someone start the motor (in
neutral!). You should see the spark. If not, try switching #3 and #4 plug
wires to do some debugging on why #4 isn't sparking. Could be as simple as a
bad plug wire connection.

If you get spark, get the motor compression checked.

What motor are we talking about here? Carb or F.I.?
