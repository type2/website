Subject: Air brakes?

Air Brake Nick scribbled:

&gt; mando friday content: anyone ever consider rigging a westy poptop as an
&gt; airbrake? thats what i always think of when i put mine up.... :)
&gt;

I tried that going down the freeway, but the jet wash made all the cars
behind me go into a flat spin 8^o

So, instead, I hooked up an electronic &quot;jack&quot; of sorts to make a sail out of
it (mine hinges in the front) at the push of a button. Any time I'm heading
downwind, I hit The Button, and gain 3mph and 5mpg.

And I thought I was the only one who had these things in mind...
