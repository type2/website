Subject: Re: [T2] Shipping costs

I have noticed that shipping &amp; HANDLING has gone
sky-high as the unscrupulous vendors often charge more
for handling than for the product. It used to be that
the cost of packaging was a regular business expense
and amortized into the gross sales but now I suspect
that is still done, with the individual paying a
worst-case-scenario handling charge for his individual
item as well, without consideration of it being all in
the normal days' work and already absorbed. -BaH

&gt; Recently, I've noticed excessive shipping charges
&gt; from part vendors.
&gt; 
&gt; One order from CO was for a few rubber grommets that
&gt; weighed no where near 1lb and the charge was $9.59.
&gt; Another package came from GA was again a small
&gt; plastic item and the charge was $10.50. Both times
&gt; the part were put in a box that was too large but
&gt; the parts arrived safe and sound.
&gt; 
&gt; I should also mentioned that both were phone orders.
&gt; When I quoted the website shipping cost over the
&gt; phone, I was told it would be only $5-6 and both
&gt; times I was charged much more.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone else noticed this with their orders? I
&gt; know the cost of gas is sky high but...
