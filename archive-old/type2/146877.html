Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for urrent CA smog check parameters

&gt; Look at line ESC 10. The A row has the so called limits for the two
&gt; tests. ASM 5015 is 15mph and ASM 2525 is 25mph.

ahhhhhh.. got it.  I was wondering what 5015 and 2525 was.  I'm assuming 
that I'm looking at the A row.  What's that B row?

&gt; Each emission particulate has it's own limit column: HC, CO, NO.

got it

&gt; Then there are a second set of GP numbrs. The gross polluters numbers
&gt; shouldn't be exceeded.

hehe, hopefully I don't hit those (like I did last time)


&gt; FWIW, those numbers don't match my report. When I first saw them I
&gt; thought we were all doomed.

Yeah, that's what had me confused.  I was looking at your report numbers 
and trying to see where they matched on the PDF.  So what's that about?

So you're saying that they go by the numbers on the test report, not the 
PDF, right?


&gt; I'll do that once I find a scanner. The numbers above should be a big
&gt; help to you.

You know what, now everything's making a little more sense.  Lemme take 
the bus in tomorrow morning and see what numbers the machine reports. 
This should be interesting what the Megasquirt will produce.

Thanks,
Mike
