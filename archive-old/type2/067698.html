Getting real tired of anti-government malarkey today...

No I do not work for the government.

&gt; enough preaching about voting. there isn't anyone who i agree with. not old
&gt; man dole and his right wing agenda. not slick willy with his scandals and
&gt; wimpy administration. certainly not perot. it's my duty/right to vote but it's
&gt; also my duty/right not to vote if no candidate represents what i believe in.

Well work AHEAD of the final elections to get people you like to run.  
Not voting by staying home does nothing.  Voting but not choosing does 
send a message anyway - empty ballot, don't flip the levers whichever.  

&gt; besides, we aren't electing a president anyways. we are electing the electoral
&gt; votes...then they vote. of course, they don't have to vote the way they are
&gt; supposed to. so in effect, we aren't really voting democratically.

Well by law in most states they do.  Jail time if the goof up.

But there are quite a few more people running then the pres.  Not 
choosing to be involved is very definitely telling them - &quot;we don't care, 
do what you want&quot;.  Send letters to the ones elected.  Send letters to 
the ones annoucing they might run next time.  Tell them you don't want 
old cars (VWS!) used as smog permits - crush for credits.

&gt; let's stick to vws. they can't lie to you. they can't steal from you. they
&gt; work hard and as long as you take care of them, will keep on working hard.

So do most government workers, most of my neighbors.
