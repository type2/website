Subject: Re: [T2] gas theft

That's what I thought.  But it never occurred to me that if you  want to steal gas, you have to look for an older vehicle as all of the  newer ones have the releases inside the vehicle.  So I guess the  bus might as well have had a free gas sign on it.  But somebody  did indeed steal the gas.  I had just checked it the day  before.  I did go back and look for the gas cap.  No  luck.  One's on the way from BD.  Cheers...KR

getting low! Did you go looking for your cap? -BaH

&gt; Well, I was perfectly happy with my non-locking
&gt; original gas cap -  until last night.  I went to
&gt; dinner kind of late with a professor  friend of
&gt; mine.  Parked across the lot from the place.  It's 
&gt; just about 1/4 mile from my house.  This morning I
&gt; noticed that  the gas guage didn't work.  Well below
&gt; the empty mark.  The  bus was almost empty anyhow
&gt; but I made it to the gas station where I  noticed
&gt; that my gas cap was missing.  It has been over a
&gt; week  since I filled up and I'm confident I would
&gt; have noticed it.  My  guage reads 1/2 full when it's
&gt; full.  So I always fill up when I  hit the empty
&gt; mark.  Yesterday I was near that mark and planned on
&gt;  filling up today anyhow.  Well, my tank took 14
&gt; gallons!   I've never been able to put more than 12
&gt; in it on the empty mark.
