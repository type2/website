Subject: [T2] Solex carb x-shaped pipe thingy?

O' Mighty List,
I have a 1.7L T-IV, I think it's a 73, installed by the PO in my
1977 bay window. It has a weber carb and it runs okay. It has passed
smog inspection here in AZ with flying colors, but, I'm thinking of
putting the solex carbs back in. I have a pair of used solex carbs that
need to be re-built. My question is, (finally), what can I use to replace
the x-shaped crossover pipes with that I see in diagrams between the
carbs which of course I do not have, nor have I seen one in any 
junkyards here in Phoenix. Does any of this make sense? This engine is equipped with an 009 distributor and empi exhaust.
Thanks in advance,
Jeff and the Friojle Grande
