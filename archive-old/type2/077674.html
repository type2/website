&gt; I've been looking for said &quot;automatic&quot; valve that would open when the

&gt; Would be a great safety item in case of fire - would keep fuel from beeing 
&gt; added to the fire and would require no effort to close - I'm certainly not 
&gt; going to lean under my bus to turn a valve!!!

hmmmmm,  wonder if any washing machine or other similar device uses a
valve that works on 12 volt.  that would do the job.

&gt; Maybe a brass valve with a choke cable added to the lever...

I was also considering this, or possibly from an interstate (greyhound
type) bus that is required to have a &quot;dump valve&quot; that shuts the engine
down under any circumstance.   maybe from an old bus.  buses went 24v
somewhere in the late 60's early 70's.     
    Just a push  button under a safety cover activate the dump valve which
releases a spring loaded valve that slams shut.   depending on the design
it would probably require some rework.  they have to be manually reset so
that would be a consideration too.

hmmmm, got me thinking, I work it the bus industry so I may start nosing
around see what I can find
