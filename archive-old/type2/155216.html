Subject: Not bus but car related - need auto transport recommendation

Wayne,
        Who is moving your furniture and household objects?  The reason I ask 
this:  Last week I was pondering how to move my non-running Jaguar [maybe that 
is redundant] when the movers showed up with a huuuuge van.  They said they 
were returning from another trip and their original quote would apply.  For a 
few more bucks, the driver/partner said they could take the Jaguar in the van, 
as a piece of furniture ;-))

I called a rollback buddy, who came promptly, loaded the Jag on his rollback, 
and then offloaded it into the moving van... this was after the furniture was 
loaded in the front of the van, and we had ~18 ft of clear space over the rear 
wheels.  Bottom line, I moved 3500 lbs of 1987 XJ-6, some walnut, mostly metal, 
from Maryland to South Carolina for an incremental $300...400 -- a favorable 
deal that I could not pass up, and it worked out just fine.

If you are looking for a glowing recommendation of moving company, ask me by 
private email.  This company from Spartanburg did a terrific job for me!

Glenn

I need to get a 1981 BMW 320i moved from Charlotte, NC to Wilton, CT.  Can
anyone recommend an honest and careful transport company?  Other than
driving it, other suggestions appreciated.
