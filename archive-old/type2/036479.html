&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone out there have a lead on those nifty fans

&gt; &gt; &gt; ducts, just below the dash?
&gt; &gt; &gt; I know at least one Listte has them (got 'em
&gt; from
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mexico I believe)...

Does anyone out there have a part # on these babies.
That might speed things up. I will be going across
Tuesday or Thursday afternoon to see what I can find
out.
