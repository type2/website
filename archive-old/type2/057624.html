Subject: carb question 2

Volks,

As I continue to get my carbs balanced and working properly, I keep running
accross things that are missing.  The latest is a thermostatic valve that
regulates the injection quantity of the accelerator pump.  This valve is
only installed on 1974 automatic transmissions.  Sooo, my question is; is
this a vital component on my carb?  Will this affect any performance of the
engine?

As always, all help is greatly appreciated
