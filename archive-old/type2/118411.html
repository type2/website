Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0L rebuild question

If you're going to do this, go get yourself a copy of &quot;How to Rebuild Your
Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine&quot; by Tom Wilson.  The has very clear directions
for tearing down all VW engines - including the TypeIV - and specs for the
various components.  You'll need to measure things as you go, or take
parts/assemblies to a mechanic for measurement.  There's no quantifying &quot;a
lot of play&quot; so you need to measure and see if things are in spec.  Don't
bother rebuilding the engine unless you're going to perform these
measurements.

Subject: [T2] 2.0L rebuild question


&gt; I've decided to go ahead and give my newest project a fresh rebuild.
&gt; This is my first time.  I'm about th split case.  This brings me to my
&gt; question.  I noticed that the connecting rods have a lot of play in them.
&gt; should they be like that? and what is the anticipated amout of movement?
