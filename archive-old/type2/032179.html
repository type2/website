I'd stick with the FI unless something really bad and really expensive
goes wrong on it.  Having done the carbs thing after the ECU on my fuel
injection system quit, I can tell you you'll have plenty of 'downtime' if
you make the switch!  It takes a lot longer than you think!  Just removing
all the FI stuff from the engine took me a whole afternoon.  I liked the
FI, wanted to keep it...it runs so silky-nice, in the winter you can fire
up with one turn of the key and drive right off.  I just didn't want to
spend $280 on a rebuilt ECU that was un-returnable.  Your problem sounds
like a simple loose connector, no big deal, just tricky to find. 
Sometimes the spade connectors back out of the nylon plugs and don't seat
right. 

I've spent over a week of afternoons on mine after putting carbs on it
(can only work on it during term breaks, right now), and I'm still fixing
small problems that I created or ran into.  Would I do it again?  Yeah,
given the same circumstances, and hopefully I'd do a better job.  But you
better believe I checked that FI wiring harness from end to end and inside
out with an ohmmeter, and tested every part I could,  before I gave up on
it.
