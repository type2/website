That would be a good race if both vehicles had the same weight and tranny
gearing.  I sure do wish VW wouldn't have gone to such a high 3rd and 4th
gears in the later bays.  Thats why I am putting a '73 tranny in my '76
westy, maybe it'll be closer then!!

But I'd still like to see if your 1776 could pull a trailer or another bus
up and down some of the mountain passes we took this summer for as long as
we did, over 5,000 miles and still have a strong running engine.


&gt; I agree completely that putting a type 1 in a late bus is pure folly.
&gt; 
&gt; I also agree that a *stock* type 1 is underpowered and won't last as long as
&gt; a stock type 4 engine.
&gt; Now my very un-stock 1776 type 1 in my 71 bus is *real* strong after ~80K
&gt; and I bet I make it to 200K no problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll race ya Rick ;-)
