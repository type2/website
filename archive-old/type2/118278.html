Subject: Parted out a 1970 Alabama Camper

I parted out a 70 Bus this weekend with a camper 
conversion by &quot;Alabama Camper&quot;.  Anyone have any info on 
this conversion?

If anyone needs any items from this bus, let me know and 
we can work somthing out.  There is a good roof section 
(no sunroof or pop-top)that is available, other than that 
most body panels are rusted out.  

I am in southern Wisconsin.
