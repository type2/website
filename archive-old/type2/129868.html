Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel injectors / pressure

When I lived in Italy I had a carb/EFI specialist that I made friends with. He spoke no English and my Italian was too specialized around resturants, where was the bathroom, and which way to Pompeii... 

Anyhow he had an old fuel rail and electrical drivers setup. The fuel line went to a can that had an air line and a gauge. He could pressurize the can - full of cleaner fluid -from the air compressor, set the pressure with the guage, and watch the spray patterns or measure the spray patterns into long graduated glass tubes. There is a chemistry name for this but... Glass tube with a valve on the bottom.

He would cycle the injectors and run a bunch of injector cleaner through them, make sure they put out the same volume and that the spray pattern was good. 

All parts were junkheap stuff with the exception of the glass tubes. I do not know how he cycled the injectors unless it was an old EFI brain. Can you just put a voltage to the ijectors and hold them open without burning them up?
