Unless of course you're talking about rocker PANELS,
which is what I thought he was talking about in the
original post.  If so, Rockers are bottome few inches
of the sheet metal on each side between the two
wheels. If they are rusty, you can do it right and cut
out all old rusty metal and weld in new.  Or if they
aren't too bad and you're not a perfectionist, you can
just patch them up.
