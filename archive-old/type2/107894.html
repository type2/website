&gt;Subject: Oil sensor hole has rough face and leaks
&gt;Message-ID: &lt;3F364E57.D7780D5C_at_cox_dot_net&gt;
&gt;snip
&gt;I noticed oil dripping from the sender's nut today, and when I took it
&gt;off, I was surprised at the rough seam on the case, running right across
&gt;where the sender seats.
&gt;Is this normal? Should I carefully file the raised part away?

ggm replies, Wow, what a great picture,the rough casting marks are perfectly
normal. the slightly raised threads at the hole opening are normal. Please
don't waste anytime making things looks pretty but functionless. Aluminum
metal filings are soft and they might not ruin any bearings in the engine,
but your file may have hard steel filings from some previous filing job. If
the steel filings get in the engine they could load up in some bearing and
cause it to fail.

The sender has pipe threads. American pipe threads have a 1/4&quot; taper per 1
foot length of thread. I don't know the specifications for metric pipe
threads, but they taper too.  Pipe threads seal like a tapered cork. The
tighter you screw the plug into the hole, the tighter it squeezes against
the sides of the hole. WARNING if you screw the low oil pressure oil sensor
into the hole too tightly, you can split the case and ruin it. I clean the
male and female threads with any organic de-greaser (not detergent) sprayed
onto a super clean super lint free rag. Then I paint the male threads with
whatever adhesive sealer I have on hand that is similar to that used to seal
the case. I let the sealer dry the appropriate length of time. I screw the
sensor in just tight enough to not leak or not get loose.

&gt;Also,what's up with the case's paint flaking? Is that paint factory
spec'ed?
&gt;It seems to just rub off with a rag.

I suspect that the sleezy lazy rebuilder did not clean case properly but
instead just sprayed the case with el cheapo silver paint to make the engine
look nice and shiny in a trick to make the engine look like it was actually
repaired rebuilt correctly.
