Subject: re:  Baywindow Middle Seat Fold Down

&gt;I was just wondering if any of you folks out
there have ever modified the middle seat of your
baywindow so that it would fold down. 
Suggestions?

I had a folding middle seat out of an 84
wolfsburg vanagon once.  It folded forward but
not really flat.  If you're willing to drill and
mount one, it might work for you.  More farfer...
fahrpher... ferfuer... whatevergnugen than seats
from other minivans.   

Happy bussin'
