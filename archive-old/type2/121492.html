Subject: Re: [T2] Propane heater

&gt;The CO issue... I was curious about how this works. It is not electronic 
&gt;which is good I suppose. It is essentially a special nozzle for the pilot 
&gt;light. It depends on air passing through the nozzle from below to keep it 
&gt;lit. If the oxygen content of the air drops (CO rises to a certain point) 
&gt;then the pilot light will go out, the heater will then go out and the gas 
&gt;will shut off seconds later. I do not plan to test this with my life or my 
&gt;family's life! &lt;grin&gt;

For what it is worth I HIGHLY agree with the other listers: be careful with 
the CO. Don't rely on the heater tricks to keep you safe. Remember that CO 
is cumulative too - it builds up so even if you are going outside and 
coming back into a dangerous environment, you can still get poisoned.

Read all the safety warnings.

In small places like my shed or the bus I use the heater to warm up the 
space and then often will turn it off while I am in the space. My shed 
doors don't seal well and I leave a window open in the bus. I really prefer 
electric heaters for long term heating of the shed, bus, or other smaller 
spaces.

I'd like to think there is truely something safe like the &quot;ventless&quot; 
fireplaces but I don't trust those either... &lt;grin&gt;
