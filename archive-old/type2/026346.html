I guess I will ask the question that seems to stick in the back of my mind.
Does ANYONE out there have and regularly use the A/C in their bus?  How long
have you used it, and under what conditions; temps, hills, etc.?  I have
never heard of anyone expressing such a thing.  Can it be done?

Now that the lovely desert temperatures are approaching 110 degrees, I'm
beginning to notice a pretty large difference between the readings of the
cyl head and oil temp on my 82 aircooled westy.  The oil sensor is
sump-mounted.  My cyl head temp never goes above 225, but hte oil temp gauge
sometimes will read at close to 280.  I have a feeling that it may not be
wired correctly, as it tends to fluxuate with the dimmer switch for
headlights, but i still think it is running a bit hot.  The van has an
aftermarket a/c from PO, which I have not used as I haven't been able to
locate the dumb little belt for it.  Will the cutout on the tin for the
compressor cause this high temp?  I would like to run the a/c, but if it is
going to mean overheating problems and limited reliability, I will scrap the
a/c and replace the tin, rather than risk breaking down.  Would an aux
cooler help?  Any suggestions are appreciated!
Thanks
Mike
