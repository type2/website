Subject: Re: [T2] coil wires?

I can't tell you where the wires go but only one goes to the positive
side of the coil, that would be the wire from your ignition switch. If
you've been just shooting in the dark and swapping wires around you've
probably burned up your points, blown the resistor out of your rotor arm
(if it had one) and smoked your condenser. You could have had it right
but had bad ignition parts. + = Ignition switch, - = Point set, tach, FI
if you got it (think not).
Hayes manuals are less than $16.00, break down and buy one, its cheaper
than a tank of gas.
