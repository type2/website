ok....I got my bus towed to my house about 10 minutes ago...
I'm too overwhelmed with excitement I can barely type or figure out why
my wheel is stuck.  Its the rear drivers side wheel....it won't
budge...all of the other wheels move...
the PO  had the parking brake on for who knows how long...
I'm thinking that the brake is stuck to the drum....rusted from the
rain...I know other people have had a problem with this...but its JUST
that wheel...all the others are fine...

any help??
oh yeah...and now my sliding door won't open... it opened last
night....it feels like its locked...but it isn't...any suggestions??
