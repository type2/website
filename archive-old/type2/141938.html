&gt;Anyway, had a heck of a time pulling the old cable out.  Things slid
&gt;easily for the first foot or so, then the end of the cable caught on
&gt;something and wouldn't move either way.  I finally unbolted the Bowden
&gt;tube from the tranny and gave it a hearty pull, dislodging the Bowden tube
&gt;from the cable.

My last cable broke inside the bowden tube. I had a terrible time removing it:

&gt;Further examination showed a plastic sleeve pressed into the front (FIF)
&gt;end of the bowden tube that extended into the clutch tube under the bus.
&gt;The inner diameter of that tube was distorted so that the threaded end of
&gt;the cable got caught in the sleeve and could only be dislodged through
&gt;considerable force.  The sleeve was a tight press fit in the inside of the
&gt;Bowden tube, but I finally twisted it out.  The sleeve extended only two
&gt;inches (tightly) into the Bowden tube, but extended about a foot (loosely)
&gt;into the metal tube under the bus.

The older bowden tubes seem to have a plastic nose. The newer ones from Gemo are metal:

&gt;I'd like to poll the group wisdom on the sleeve I removed.  It might be a
&gt;modification from a PO or it might be leftover part of an old cable.  If
&gt;it's truly something that should be there I will replace it, but things
&gt;seem to work smoothly without it.

Could be. There is a plastic sleeve inside the entire length of the bowden tube for the cable to ride on.
