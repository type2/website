Larry,

I ran into a massive problem with flooding on a '87 syncro that I drive.  I
think, if memory serves me right, that the problem could apply to most of
the FI systems that were used.

All of the fuel injectors are fired at the same time, and consequently, use
wiring that is tied together.  The system runs 12vdc to all of the injectors
and the ECU controls the ground leg to fire them (easier electronically).
If one of the injectors develops a short to ground, it will in effect turn
on all of them.  I have seen this twice.  If I wiggled the connectors on the
injectors, it would sometimes clear for a little while.  The way that I
found it was to disconnect 2 of the injectors and get to run.  I would then
plug in the others one at a time to see which one is the culprit.  You may
have to experiment a bit.  The one that had the problem showed a definite
difference in resistance from connector the case.  They all varied a bit,
but one was significantly lower resistance.
I had spares from a blown motor and changing them was as simple as removing
the &quot;rack&quot; of 2 injectors and loosening the big rubber washer that pinched
them into the bracket.  A little sealant around the nose of the new
injectors and re-install.

Hope this helps
