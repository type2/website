Brett,

in all seriousness....

check gowesty_dot_com for overpriced westfalia reproductions....

check the archives/library at type2_dot_com for the camper supplement....

check other lists for love of the NB....

check your subcultures at the door....

Billy

&gt;anyone have the supplement for the gas range for a 77 &gt;westy, also i would
like to get ahold of the table &gt;for the westy or the dimensions of it and
&gt;some good pics to possibly have a replacement &gt;fabricated.  also the table
that goes between front &gt;seats is that available for the 77 westy as well.
&gt;thanx all, also point me the right way if ive &gt;transgressed my bounds.
