Subject: Failed emissions - CO(Carbon Monoxide)  [Washington St]
Date: Thu, 18 Feb 1999 16:42:53 PST

My '75 ASI Camper failed emissions for the state of Washington.  Dropped 
it off at Autohaus Vick to get a tune-up.  2 of the three are passing - 
HC and CO2.  CO (Carbon Monoxide)is off by about 3 points.  I've 
satisfied the dollar amount for the state.  I can now take it back and 
test it again and fail - then they wave me on to licensing with a 
document that says I failed but have satisfied the dollar amount.  

What is 3 CO (Carbon Monoxide) points in the scheme of things?  What 
kind of adjustments should they be looking at to adjust this?  I don't 
want to pay &quot;dink-around-time&quot; to look for ghosts in the machine if I 
don't have to.  On the other hand, if this is pointing to something I 
need to pay attention to then I want to get it fixed.  This is a 2.0L FI 
engine with approx. 120k miles.

Thanks
Danny
Bellevue, Washington
