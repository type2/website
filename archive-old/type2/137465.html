In-line photos would be a real boon to many of us.

For those on 56K dial-ups, though, it might be a total disaster.

I have been a Cable Modem guy since Cox did their first trials in
Orange County (CA) back in 1997. Man...what a difference in speed.

Sort of like going from a 69 Type II to a 2005 Subie WRX STi.

Zoom zoom.

But photos would just kill your average 56K AOL user.

PS: Heaven is where you make it.
