Subject: valve stem seals
Message-Id: &lt;v01510104b41ced4e775f_at_[207.172.184.209]&gt;

Two weeks ago, I installed valve stem seals on the Berg 1776 heads that I
got for my '71 Westy two years ago. I did so because I was adding a quart
of oil way too often on a fresh rebuild with many new parts such as the
heads.  Before I bolted  the heads on, I had a look through postings which
I've accumulated on valve stems .

The wisdom of the group is not unanimous on this subject.

Some say they can only help because they act as a dam for oil traveling
down the valve guides and into the combusion chamber where it is not
needed.

Others say they can be harmful because they allow too little oil to enter
the guide and lubrication suffers.

I'm at a big decision point and would like more advice.  In particular, has
anyone run for many miles with these seals in place?  Secondly, since they
are so cheap, wonder why VW never installed them on new engines?

Thanks, Jack
