hey, mine broke too recently in my 69 bug, but I kept it to myself.    I
cheeped out and put a used one in. Actually I didn't feel like going to the
store.     Bugster has  Better heat than the splitty, but the defogger works
better in the bus.   Then the clutch died again, this time the circlip that
held the arm that takes the cable disappeared, and the arm came off downtown
and it would be hard to speed shift home from there and I called for help and
got a tow home (from a 71 bus thank you Zach) and pulled the motor again
(maybe I'll make the rear apron unboltable like the bus, I need a better jack,
durnit its raining so hard the water is puddling on thegarage floor, I should
restore this bug, had it eight years now, at least put electrical tape squares
over the holes for the trim that isn't there to keep the rain from falling in,
every time I wash it it turns a more interesting mottled combination of
red/camo/two tone blue) so I probably should have bought  new one and saved
myself the hassle.   sorted out the arm and the TO arm and it has held
together the last few days.

Clara
