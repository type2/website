Subject: Re: fuel smell, flat spot.

Please forgive my ignorance, but can somebody explain how to set the adjustment back in the middle of the adjuster?  My 1600dp also suffers these symptoms.

Thanks,
Mike

&gt; well just got the kreeper back together-had a fuel smell in the exhaust
&gt; and it had a flat spot-009 34 pict-3 thing. anyway - i had checked all
&gt; the particulars in the carb and everything checked out. while i had it
&gt; apart, i changed the main jet to a 130 from a 127.5. i also reamed the
&gt; accelerator pump a few sizes and set the adjustment back in the middle
&gt; of the adjuster. hooked up the tach and set the idle mixture and idle
&gt; speed screw per bentley-wife said no fuel smell this time-time for road
&gt; test! wow what a difference off the bottom end! no flat spot and just
&gt; about snaps my head back in my seat! :-) well not really, but it does
&gt; accelerate much better now than ever before in the 700 miles since
&gt; rebuild. thanks to the list for the help....and thanks to karl for the
&gt; hoover piece he sent me a while back. he very quietly mailed it to me
&gt; with no request for $ not even for shipping. ok wasnt that expensive to
&gt; mail but it was the thought that counted. karl doesnt know me from the
&gt; next guy on the street but he helped me find the impossible part in my
&gt; eyes. karl, i admire you for silently helping out your fellow
&gt; bussers-brian and the kreeper
