Subject: Re: Roll your bus

&gt; I didn't particularly like the web site's demand for demographic data
&gt; before allowing access to the price list.  Not a nice thing to do!
&gt; 
Actually, it turns out it is more of a _request_ for demographic data. I
filled in the &quot;Where did you hear about this site&quot; field with &quot;Link from
another site&quot; and left the other fields blank. It let me view the
prices... they didn't look too shabby for someone that wants to do some
serious undercarriage work. About $500 for the Easy Tilter and $460 for
their jack.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If anyone would like to see one of these devices (as well as a
&gt; rotator),
&gt; &gt; one of the manufacturers, Accessible Systems, has a web site at:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  http://www.accessiblesystems_dot_com/
