&gt; ...i have been thinking about pulling
&gt; the gas tank out and cleaning it or having it cleaned by someone else.  i
&gt; have the POR-15 catalog, and it shows a &quot;auto fuel tank repair kit.&quot;  its
&gt; 49.95 and basically contains a degreaser (tank clean), metal ready, and us
&gt; standard tank sealer.  i have a vw trends article showing how they did, and
&gt; it seemed to work ok...

That the same price I paid a radiator shop to degunk and steam clean my
gas tank about 5 years ago. They did the work and I didn't have to worry
about how to dispose of the toxic cleaning products responsibly. 

You could do it yourself if you want, but it doesn't look like it'll save 
you any money.

Of course, your actual mileage may vary.  :-^
