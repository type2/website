Subject: Puttin my engine in and I've hit wall (the bus isn't even
  running yet!)
Mime-Version: 1.0

I am putting in a 1776 into my 70 bus. It's got dual carbs (what kind isn't
important) and it's been routed for an external oil cooler. The engine is
now bolted in with the tranny, I have a three point case, with the three
point rear engine mount, BUT my problem is that the rear mount wont fit
because of the fittings for the external cooler. It seems the brass oil
fittings are in the way. My question is fairly obvious by now, and the
answer is probably just as obvious. Will I need to cut the rear mount? If I
do, HOW? Both fittings are pointing to the left, and are on the left side
of the engine.
Just a tidbit of info. . . this engine was supposedly from a baja. SO how
did the previous owner mount this thing?

Please email me to reply.

Thanks

Jay Santos

        Do not follow where the path may lead.
	 Go instead where there is no path.
	 And leave a trail.
