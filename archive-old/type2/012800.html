To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello All,

Anyone have any experience buying discount furniture
(like sofa beds) in the Carolinas?  I understand
places like High Point and Hickory in NC are focal
points, but I wondered if this discount idea was
another factory outlet gimmick.  Anyone have any first
hand experience?

Also, has anyone ever put the AIRS list for the East
Coast on a spreadsheet?  I've got quite a few states
printed out, but it seems to make a pretty thick
looseleaf.  A spreadsheet with just the names, phone
numbers, and cities seems like it would almost be
enough.

Rob
