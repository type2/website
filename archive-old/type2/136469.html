Subject: Re: [T2] Odd Squeek. 76 kombi

&gt;  What else is
&gt; &gt; likely to make a rubbery squeek in the front?
&gt; 
    
Steering box rubber coupler?  I had a pesky front
squeek we couldn't reproduce by bouncing the front
end.  Then, during steering box replacement, we
removed the 2 screws holding the coupler cover from
above the steering box (like where the steering column
tube intersects the floor?; where your feet sit while
driving?), and voila!  There it was.  A rotted,
holding-on by only a thread, an old rubber coupler.  
   
Try removing the 2 screws, and raise the coupler
access plate to ELIMINATE this part as the possible
source of your pesky squeek.  Besides, if it is the
cause of your squeek, and your coupler is in a
deteriorated condition like mine was, then you have a
potential safety hazard.  Check it to be sure, sir.
