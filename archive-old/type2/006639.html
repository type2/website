Subject: Blower motor fan removal (HELP)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline



I got two blower motors, both is different states. B1 works great put the platic
fan crumbled on me last fall. B2 is the replacement blower motor I got for free
from a VW friend. It has a metal fan, sorta works but the wires are melted and
not trustworthing. I want to take the metal fan off of B2 and put it on B1. I
got B1 apart (out of the magnetic casing) but cannot for the life of me figure
out how to remove the fan from the armature(?) on either or the motors.  Any
ideas?
