Subject: RE:Regular V's Premium (Knock Sensing)

Hi All,

Has anyone considered building a knock sensor.  I have an article on making
one from a late model sensor with the rest of the parts being picked up from
a breakers, total cost is fairly minimal.  The original sensor sent a signal
to the computer that automatically retarded the ignition until the knocking
stopped and then advanced it until it started again.  This happened
continually to get optimum performance.  Of course in our buses and bugs it
would just have to illuminate an LED or something like that and you stop the
knocking by backing of the go-fast peddle.

My main question here is is there too much mechanical noise from our
aircooled engines for a knock sensor to be able to tell the difference
between knocking and normal engine noise.  The computer in the donor car
stops monitoring the knock sensor at about 4000rpm as the engine it's
monitoring becomes too noisey and the sensor becomes inaccurate, the engine
is a water cooled 3.8lt V6.

Any ideas if this is a viable option??

Cheers
Steve

In the absence of detonation, I don't see how this can be.  Low octane
fuels have the same heat value as high octane fuels.  The only
difference is that high octane fuels have a lower flame front
propagation speed, which reduces their tendancy to auto-ignite (knock).

The FTP reference you cite makes no connection between octane and
operating temperature.
