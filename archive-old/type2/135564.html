Subject: Bumper question

I seem to be having trouble finding a good used rear bumper for my 73,
so I decided to go shopping for a new one.

BD has a primered bumper for $80. Chrome for $120. WW has primered for
$125, with no chrome listed.

Since it's obvious that I'll be getting it from BD (even with shipping
it's cheaper than WW where I can go pick it up), anybody have any
comments on the chrome one? Quality? I like the idea of not having to
paint it after I get it. And chrome is just so.... BLING!

The BD picture sucks, but it appears to have a rubber molding. Is this correct? 

;-)
