Subject: re dual carb air box questions?

I have not seen a reply to the air box bits question from yesterday, and 
unfortunately deleted it.
The 3 parts (don't remember the numbers) which you said you didn't have are 
a thermo switch for cold or hot inlet air.
These three parts are actually inside the plastic junction from the air box 
to the RH carby. All you see is two 1/8&quot; tubes poking out the plastic 
junction piece.

It's function is to monitor inlet air temp, and is a flap valve with bi 
metallic strip that controls vacuum (supplied from central idle tube under 
air box) and feeds to the diaphragm at the inlet to the air box. The idea is 
in cold weather it draws warm air from inside the cooling tin rather than 
cool air from above the battery.

The missing tube you mention is just to draw air from above the battery 
rather than next to No 2 spark plug and can be replaced by any appropriate 
sized tube.

Hope that helps!!

Regards,
Richard
