Everyone,

The tranny, short block and sliding door are spoken for.

Still available are:

&gt;1) Top fold out cot from a Westy. The kind that fold in half like an army
&gt;cot. Has hardware and canvas, but the canvas is pretty rotten.
&gt;
&gt;5) Some spare rubber mats from the floor of a baywindow. I don't remember
&gt;if they are early or late, but I think that they were from a '69 or '70.
&gt;
&gt;6) A jalousie window from a baywindow. I am pretty sure it works.

It is oil change day in the motor pool tomorrow, so Ill dig around the shed 
and stuff and see if I can turn up anything else I know that I won't need.

Chris
