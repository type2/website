&gt;Do I need a stethscope? Any suggestions?


A stethoscope will work, or you could try this old mechanic's trick.
Take a long 3/8' socket extension, grab it in your hand with your thumb
folded over the end. Put the knuckle of your thumb right into your ear
and press the other end up against the head, or even the valve cover,
moving it down the gallery until the noise gets loudest. When it begins
to fade, you just passed the spot.
