Subject: they all chug at low rpm
Message-Id: &lt;v01510100b3331abaf723_at_[207.172.60.196]&gt;

My sons and I own seven ACs among us including two buses. For five of
these,  we have rebuilt the engines, some several times.  For two of these,
we have never pulled the engine.The latest rebuild is a 1776 in my '71
Westy which I just drove this week for the first time since way back.

Here is the perplexing problem.  The two  whose engines have never been
pulled make the transition off idle the way I remember vws when I bought
them new many years ago.  For all five that have been rebuilt- various
combinations of vacuum distributors, 009s, dual Kadrons, and 34PICT 3s are
represented in this group -   the transition off idle and at low rpm is
more a chugging than a smooth pull.  Unless one is generous with the pedal,
all five act this way.

As you can imagine, I suffer from low  esteem, mechanic-wise. Before I
submit to therepy, can anyone suggest a reason for these two groups?

Thanks, Jack
