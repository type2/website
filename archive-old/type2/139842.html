&gt; Hello Mark  I suspect what your problem is you are buying online and not off
&gt; a Snap-on dealer truck.  I have a regular dealer that stops by every tuesday .
&gt; I never have any problems cause the dealer handles it , sells the tools with
&gt; payments, also you get to check the tool out and make sure it is what you
&gt; want.   I dont think that they are set up to sell to the general public but only

a local snap on dealer lets me buy from him when he stops at a nearby gas
station, have to pay all at once, no time payments, but will sell me
anything he can get, and yes highest quality and service. but also top
dollar too, not being a full time mechanic like you I am very selective in
what I get from him.   Most tools I have are good quality home mechanic
level tools such as Craftsman or my favorite S/K tools.

Bob
