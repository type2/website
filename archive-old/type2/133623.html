Subject: Re: [T2] Molding for roof panel

I know the stuff well... I have also been looking for some for my '69
Westy.  I have been unsuccessful finding anything locally.  Tried all the
usual online VW places (GoWesty, Bus Co, etc)... no dice.

Would sure LOVE to find something that will work.  Suggestions?  Thanks.

'69 Campmobile

&gt; I am looking for the molding that goes around the hole in the roof of a
&gt; 1970 Westfalia.  Ya know the stuff that helps holds the wood paneling up
&gt; above the rear seat.  The paneling and/or the molding have shrunken over
&gt; the years and no longer make contact so that the panel is sagging badly.
&gt; Can I get something that'll work at the local hardware store?
