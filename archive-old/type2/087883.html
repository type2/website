Subject: Child's cot question..

------=_NextPart_000_0005_01C24008.525DF300
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Someone else on the list was asking about the placement of a child's cot =
across the front seat in a late 70's Westy. I have the '79 (with the =
turn-about seat) and promised to report back on my findings for the =
placement of the half-moon shaped brackets on the front and rear door =
columns.=20
Here's the deal. On the rear columns, the brackets are placed at very =
slightly below the level of the top of the seat.. not the headrest, but =
the highback seat. From there, on level ground, you can use a level to =
place the brackets on the front columns. I used a long mason's level to =
check this, but a line level would do. They are about 3&quot; above the dash, =
more or less. But the front and rear brackets are supposed to be level =
with each other.=20
Hope this helps.. Jan B
