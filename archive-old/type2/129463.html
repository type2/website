Subject: So where are all those who drop tranny w/engine

Well, the 75 has everything disconnected, and I'm contemplating dropping
them together as the tranny must go- but no one responded to my qu re
this- I think it is nearly impossible to get to the upper trans mounts
near the bell housing, as the head side faces where the starter/top of
tranny is, and the nuts hide where you can't see them unless the engine
is out!  Worse, how do you line them up when rejacking the combo up -
will the holes magically line up when the nose and rear carrier are
rebolted?  This idea seems good for a 71 bus, but a late bay??
