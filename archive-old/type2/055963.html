Subject: Right tail light mystery

Hi Volks,
I am THIS close to finally getting the Turtle on the road after working on
it since November.  The last (I hope) obstacle is getting the right tail and
license plate light working.  With Bentley's help, I have all other lights
finally working.  The electrical had been really butchered.  I have the live
wire from the harness, 12V when the light switch is on.  So far, so good.  I
hook up the tail, license, and marker light with confidence.  Nothing.  No
voltage.  Shorter version is, as soon as I connect a bulb, any bulb, the
voltage disappears on the meter.  Shut off or remove said bulb and the
voltage staggers back to 12V.  On the same circuit is the front parking
lamps. They work.  No blown fuses.  Tried pulling those front bulbs, no
diff.  All the flashers work, even rt rear.  I suppose there's a ground loop
or a short between live circuits, or something.  I'm usually pretty good
with electrical but this one is weird.  This bus hasn't been on the road for
eight years, so assume nothing.  HELP!  If I can get the Turtle roadworthy.
and if I'm daring, I'll take the trip down from VT to the Litchfield
Bugfest.  Maybe seeya there.
