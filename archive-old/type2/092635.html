Since there is no data available from Bosch, the only way to determine 
specs would be to compare to a new unit, then hope to get the tension 
uniform by comparison. I would never suggest to a client that this could be 
done for less than the cost of a new unit, because you could dink with it 
for weeks and end up with bad results.

&gt;p.s.  the bypass screw has also been dicked with and I
&gt;don't know where it should be set.  all emmissions
&gt;long gone.  do I need a gas analyzer?

Yes! An exhaust gas measure is the only way to verify mixture correctly.
