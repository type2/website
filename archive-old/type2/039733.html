Subject: Smog/dizzy/vacuum advance...help!

I can't get my 74 dual Solex 1776, manual transmission to pass the CA 
smog requirement for CO at low idle.

The distributor in the bus is a 021-905-205S single advance unit for 
an auto trannie bus. Based on some of the earlier list conversation, 
I'm wondering if the lack of a vacuum retard might be the source of 
the problem. It sounds to me as if my distributor is designed to run 
at 5 ATDC, yet the smog guys have to do the test at 10 ATDC.

Are my assumptions correct? What do you suppose the best remedy 
is...for example, how hard is it to find a 021-905-205N (or J) dual 
advance unit? I'm not seeing anything in the online parts catalogs.

Thanks mucho in advance--my hide is on the line. I've got to get this 
beast out of the garage and on the road pronto. I can hear the old 
lady sharpening the boning knife at this very moment...
