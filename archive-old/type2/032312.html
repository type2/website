New to the list only.
I live in the Seattle, Washington  USA area and have had way to many air
cooled Vee Dubs over the past 30 years (this summer).
I have owned several Busses, but never a camper.  Well, that has all
changed now and I have just purchased a '66 Westy and will begin
restoration next summer some time.
I have looked at the archive and library for the type II and can see that
I will be busy researching the info stored there.  I'm impressed with the
content so far.
I own other VWs, a '56 Kabriolett, '71 Super and a '66 Std.
A warm &quot;Hi&quot; to all of ya.
later
