Subject: Yahoo!!!  It Runs!!!  (and a little question too)

Yahoo!!!
    I got my bus runnin. All the time that i thought that it was somethin 
with the FI system or not enough gas pressure, it turns out to be the coil. 
   My problem started out with after about thirty seconds of running, it 
would stall. I ran on it till it wouldnt start (just a day or two of local 
driving). I tested all that i could and even started using parts from my 
friends bus to find the culprit. None of this helped, so my girlfriend 
brought me her coil from her 80 Rabbit.  We put it on and it started like a 
ball of fire blazing out of hell. Just to make sure, we switched back to my 
coil, and it wouldnt start. 
  So we put hers back on, and to life it came.  But as when the problem first 
presented itself, it would stall after only 5-10 seconds. i didnt want to 
force it to run when it didnt want to, so i took all the air hoses off and 
cleaned them up. Out of my excitement, we started it back up and forgot to 
put the air filter box and AFM back on, but it decided not to stall. I looked 
in the engine compartment and realized that i was running it without that, so 
i shut it off, and put it all together. It ran around the block like the 
happy scout that it always is. 
   I'm wondering if anybody may have any insights as to what may have caused 
such a blockage to make it stall like that; i hope that this doesnt occur in 
the near future.
 thanks bunches for all the advice that i have recieved from all you great 
listees. Even though it had nothing to do with the FI system, i can now take 
it apart, test it, follow all of its stuff, and have an understanding of what 
is happening in case i will need that knowledge.
