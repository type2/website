Subject: Re: too cool?

That cool is not good, either. Check to make sure that your thermostat wire 
and the thermostat itself are functional and properly adjusted. The flapper 
lever should be pushed forward to the limit and then the wire snugged up to 
remove all slack, all this with the engine cold. As you then take it for a 
short spin make sure the thermostat ultimately allows the flapper lever to 
rotate toward the rear of the van to the full open position under the action 
of the coil spring on the cross shaft. The pitfall of the adjustment is that 
if you do it with a fatigued (stretched out) thermostat, then the flapper 
doors can't open all the way and you overheat the engine. So watch this 
adjustment carefully! A new thermostat when cold is totally collapsed, coils 
squeezed tight together. If not, buy a new one. Don't ask how I know this!
