&gt; &gt; ... I snagged a bunch of CDs from my parents many years ago when I was
&gt; still in high school and living inside...
&gt; 
&gt; CD's?  Had you written &quot;8-track cassettes&quot;, I would have been impressed. :O)

what are you looking for, have a box of 8-track cassettes for the 8track
player that never got into my bus... of course it was the latest and
greatest then.  was driving my 60, 23window or my 65Westy.  my current bus
hadn't even been designed yet.......wish I still had either of those old
buses
