I have an 83 Aircooled 2000 cc FI.

1. The current ignition wire  set is wire core and the coil to
distributor is resistance wire.

2. The OEM wireset was wire core on both the coil wire and the plug wires
BUT it had a resistor built into the rotor.

Question: Do I need  the resistor rotor with the #1. current wireset?
Question: Why do various sources on rotor arms deliver them to me with
various width blades. The OEM was about 3/8 wide with a resistor.
Replacements I purchased have a blade about 1/4&quot; wide wothout a resistor.
