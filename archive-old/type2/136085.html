Subject: Re: [T2] Trendy Bus Advertisement

&gt; And Todd, Bay's first appeared in 1968 so unless
&gt; someone had just picked up
&gt; a brand-spanking-new 1969 Bus all of the ones at
&gt; Woodstock were 1968, 1st year, models.

No no!, the first modelyear is 1968, so they started
production in august 1967! It is the year with all
these one-year-only items such as the inner rear view
mirror and the door handles with push-knobs, instead
of the 'squeeze handles'.

&gt; &lt;Woodstock was August 15, 16, 17 -- the 1969 model
&gt; year started August 1st&gt;

So I guess they must have been all 1968 models. I
don't see how a 1969 model could be there in time,
there must be at least a month in between runing from
the assembly line to being delivered to the customer.
