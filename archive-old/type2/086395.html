Subject: coolest customer yet!!

I thought I would share a good story,

I got a call from Henry yesterday. He was looking for a transmission for his
1970 bus that's in Indonesia. While he is in the states, 10 days, he has
been visiting family in Denver and is leaving tomorrow.  Wow.

I have been to south east Asia but never Indonesia my girl friend has and
she said she loved the people and I now know what she means. Henry came by
with his wife and brother and talked shop for a while. Turns out he runs a
bus club there. After some small talk we get to business,.... bargaining.
This guy could talk a turtle out of his shell. We'll I wont tell you what a
deal I ended up giving him but, I will tell you that, in the end, I got a
great deal of satisfaction out of it. Henry agreed to take a trans out of a
'75 engine fire bus we have. Turns out his 1970 has the later style trans
hangers, also '68-'72 front but '73-'79 air intake vents on the rear
corners. We both figured that the fire killed the bus the bus and the trans
was probably good. So we pulled it up to the door and off he went, oh, yeah
don't forget that he is flying back tomorrow! His wife and brother went off
to the mall for some shopping, I gave him some tools and  coveralls, he
gives me his t-shirt (it was from a vw show in Indonesia). Cool!

In order to fly with the trans Henry takes it apart. Everything, This was
his first time taking one completely apart too. He used the throw out fork
to remove the adjusting rings!   The whole time Henry comments on all the
parts that I am packing for the days orders, he knows years and all the
stuff to look for and he also over hears some trouble shouting Blake and I
have about his dist. and make a comment. I told him to come back and work
for us the next time he's in the states. He declines as he has a great job
making transformers for the company that makes those fast trains in France
and has an engineering degree.

Well Henry's wife is back from the mall and it's getting late, she asks him
to finish up and helps us gather parts into small boxes and into the car. We
shake hands and shear smiles, I get invited to Indonesia when things settle
down and Henry promises to keep in touch. Here are some photos of Henry
pulling the trans.

Please send a warm welcome from the list to Henry (henry_volksw_at_yahoo_dot_com)
in hopes of getting him to join the list, he would be a great resource for
technical bus stuff and that good old vw spirit. Take care, have a safe trip
and good luck getting that thing through airport security.
