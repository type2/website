I tend to agree that it might be a disc going bad.  My rig started not
liking 1st and 2nd, adjusted, still didn't like it, and finally lost
going into gear at all.  Someone told me to try replacing the clutch
cable first, as it might be stretched.  Still no gears.  As a result
of me being a mechanical doof, I wrecked the pressure plate and the throw
out bearing trying to shove it in gear.  Might as well replace them while
you're in there anyway.

Also, don't forget to check your fuel lines!

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; Over the last week or so, I have noticed that it is harder and harder
&gt; to get my shifter to engage into first gear and even second- 3rd and
&gt; 4th are fine.  When I go to shift into reverse, I've noticed some grinding,
&gt; too (I think that could be unrelated to the shifter).
