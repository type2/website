Subject: Was gonna flame but now I say good job BUS DEPOT

On Monday ( March 29 ) at 11:45 I called BUS DEPOT (the phone number you can
ask questions on, so on my dime) and after asking a couple of questions I
figured out what I needed and ordered 2 items:

1) Complete OEM Sachs kit (disc, pressure plate, throwout bearing)
2) Flywheel Lock

I wanted these prity fast so I asked what estimated shiping time would be to
Toledo Ohio. Not being a gambaling man, and wanting it here THIS WEEK, I
decided to pay the the extra $$ for 2-3 day shipping and was assured that
I'd have it &quot;....by Thursday at the latest...&quot;.

So out to the garage I go, finised wiring up the power, cleaned out space
for the engine drop, and hit the &quot;SUPER 4 DAY TRUCK LOAD TOOL SALE&quot; that is
in town, and picked up an &quot;ATV LIFT&quot; to help me drop &quot;DA'BUS's&quot;  2 liter
engine.

Well Thursday rolls around and I get a UPS e-mail with the tracking number
and stating: &quot;Scheduled Delivery: 05-April-2004&quot;

Not wanting to &quot;FLY OF THE HANDEL&quot; I checked the tracking number &quot;Detail&quot;
and found
That the item did't even ship till &quot;Mar 31, 2004&quot;, Vary P*#_at_$D OFF by this
point I called BUS DEPOT to find out what was going on... the person I
talked to was vary cool about the whole thing and quickly defused me, and
let me me know it should be here by Friday, &quot;..unless UPS is really backed
up...&quot;

So I figured if the stuff was not here my like 7:00pm today it was gonna be
&quot;FLAME TIME&quot; Well it got here _at_ 2:22 P.M, so feeling gulty..I figured I'd
just drop a note saying,

     GOOD JOB BUS DEPOTE

Thanks again
