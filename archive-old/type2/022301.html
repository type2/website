I have recently purchased a '71 bus. It was originally just a transporter
but the PO did a fairly nice conversion...added the 2/3 fold out bed, a fold
up table, jump seat, and closet down the passenger side. Unfortunately (and
obviously), there is no pop-top. I suppose somebody out there has put a
pop-top on a non-pop-top-bus but I'm not too interested in that...I have
four kids and trying to wedge us all inside the bus is just out of the
question.

I'm thinking that a tent/awning would be the best solution for me and
somebody mentioned using a small trailer, which got me thinking. I'm
picturing a trailer that would be compartmentalized with areas for storage,a
propane stove, refrigerator/freezer, maybe even a fold-up shower of some
sort. Sleeping space would be provided by the tent/awning so I don't think
the trailer would have to be too large. Another advantage would be that you
could leave it hooked up to power at your camp site while you drive around
in the bus.

So(finally)my questions are these....
1. Anyone have much experience with trailer behind a bus? Is it feasible?

................Been towing a 600 pound fold-down camper since 1976 with my 
76 Westy 2 liter.

2. What do you think the weight/size limit should be? (I should mention that
the bus has a 1600DP, mostly stock, but I 'hope' to put something in the 2.0
range in.)

....................As light as possible and as low as possible. Mine is 
600 pounds and  the folded-up box is about 3 feet high, 6 feet wide, and 8 
feet long.

3. Has anyone built a trailer like this?

.....................lots of companies built these small camping trailers 
back in the 60's. Mine is a Cox. It sleeps two adults or maybe 4 
medium-sized kids. I have the plans in a drawer and could maybe scan parts 
of them and attach the scans to an email. Bitmap format(?) Say the word and 
I'll try it.  Doyt Echelberger

Any input would be appreciated!
Thanks
