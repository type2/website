Subject: '78 ca smog q's

geez, not even a month in socal and i've already made a mess! man, am i
green...

ok, so i'm new to cali and this whole smog thing. i've been busless for well
over a year now and my wife gives me the go ahead to find another westy
since it's camping weather year 'round compared to ohio. anyway, i find a
'78 that's close, pretty solid, and real cheap. don't forget i'm green. the
plates on the bus are from oregon and the sticker is from '98. the guy, real
nice guy, sez it's been sitting since he moved here. (i'll skip a bunch) so
i buy it only to realize later that since it's not from cali, there's no
catalytic converter. all the other fi stuff is there and apparently
unaltered. it does need a new muffler tho'. so what do i have to do, other
than replace the obvious muffler, to pass ca's smog test? simply put on a
cat? i called the cal dmv and they simply said it has to pass the
requirements for '78 and it isn't required to have a cat.

does anyone have any experience with this before i lay down the $ for a smog
test i know i'll fail and then head unkowingly to an exhaust shop?

thanks!

tony
