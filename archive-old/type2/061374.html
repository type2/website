You have the picture links pointing to files on your local hard drive so we
can't see them!  You need to upload them to your ISP.  I put 575 lights on
my bus this year, driven by a power inverter.  White, multi-colored,
moving, blinking, etc..  Really looks funny driving down the freeway with
them on.  A guy stopped me yesterday and yelled out his window, &quot;That's the
funniest gawdam thing I've ever seen!&quot;  - that's Texans for you.
