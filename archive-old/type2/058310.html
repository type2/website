Subject: Going to Sevierville, TN show?

Many, many thanks to the listees who responded to our search for the
cots for the 71 Westy.  

We have located an upstairs cot and mechanism.  There is only one catch
- the owner can get a ride for it to the Sevierville, TN show on October
3-4, BUT we are in Northern Va. and can't get away that weekend.  Is
there anyone on the list from our area who is attending the show and 
would be willing to courier this bulky package to their house?

I can pick up wherever is convenient for you and will help pay for gas
for your trip or we can work some other form of payment    
out.

TIA, 
Karen
