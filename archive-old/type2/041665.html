Subject: Re: What Issue???????  Use VWapster

Rob, et.al.-
                 The July 1990 issue of Dune Buggies and Hot VW's has an 
extensive article
on type 4 engine rebuilding, &quot;Close Encounters of the 4th Kind&quot;. Pages 80 - 
83 and 128
- 129
                 Also a repro of the &quot;Rear Caster Bracket&quot; schematic. This is 
from the Of-
ficial VW Workshop Manual and details construction of the bracket and caster 
to allow
type 1, 2, and 3's to be moved once the engine and transaxle have been 
removed. Page
69. It seems to be only for swing axles.
