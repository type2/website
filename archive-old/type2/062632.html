Subject: See y'all in a week

Hi Caravanophobes,

I lubed everything on my 71, crammed it full of spare parts, and aside from
that, thrown caution to the wind,  so I'm ready for the road!  I'll be gone
for a week or so (CT--&gt;NC).  Hopefully you won't see me on the side of the
highway with my engine disassembled and my head in a Bentley. 

I pulled out the rear hatch window last night to replace the dried out seal
and did some surface rust cleanup and painting. I'll pop it back in tonight
and promptly head for the highway (I dare tempt fate with a last minute repair).

Don't do anything wacky like turn into a newsgroup or a 1-900 number while
I'm gone!
