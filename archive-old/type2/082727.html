You forgot to add, John...  If the bus has been &quot;on tour&quot; with Arlo
Guthrie, check for trash under the seats :-)

I have not been privileged to own a bus that has followed any band, but
have always admired the originallity of the mods.  I *love* Richard
Palmer's bus, ferinstance.  Would that I could do as well.

On the mechanical end of things, I have seen good and bad mechanical buses
from touring origins and from middle-american origins.  Certainly the
poverty of touring inspires more &quot;originality&quot;, especially in the wiring
department, but the worst bus I ever bought was from a CB-head. I
eventually gave up and rewired it entirely.  Bad stereo/radio hookups and
dead end speaker wires scare me worse than paint every day of the week!
