Some options:

1. Use an easy-out extractor.

2. Find a torex bit that is slightly bigger than the hole, tap
   it in with a hammer and extract bolt.

3. Use Sears GripDoctor.  It works!

   I was trying to remove a couple of phillips head screws that
   the PO had stripped.  I had tried everything (penetrating oil,
   heat, etc.).  Went to Sears to see if I could get a better
   quality screw driver and saw a bottle of GripDoctor on display
   with the screwdrivers.  Picked up a bottle because I was desperate.
   Had no idea what it was.

   Tried it and the screws came out without effort.  This is simply
   a liquid with metal particles in suspension.  When used, these
   bits of metal fill in the gaps between the screwdriver and screw,
   causing the screwdriver to get a better grip.

   Don't see why it would not work on your bolts as well.

Good luck!
