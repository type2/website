Subject: 79 idling problem

Howdy,

My 1979 van has an idling problem.  It starts 
fine roars to life and then dies.  To keep it idling
i need to keep the throttle open.  Adjusting 
the timing and or the two idle screws has no effect. 
Fuel pressure is fine at roughly 30 to 35 psi. However, 
if i pinch of the return line to the fuel tank or feed 
propane into the breather it idles fine.  Simple vacuum 
leak, or something more sneaky???????  All the vacuum 
hoses are in good shape and connected properly.  Anybody 
have any hints??
