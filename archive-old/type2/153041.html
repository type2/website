Subject: Re: [T2] Boge Shocks for $18 Each!

&gt; We just bought some Boge shocks on closeout for only $17.95 each. Boge is a
&gt; much better shock that Cofap and usually sells for about three times the
&gt; price.
...
&gt; the AlKo's (which are perhaps the best value for dollar in my opinion), and
&gt; KYB's (which, as you noted above, some people find too harsh).


A|Ko's still the best value with the IP/Boge deal?

busdepot website is currently down.

Is there any reason one would want one type of front, another on the back?
