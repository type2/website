Subject: 5.5mm

I finished replacing all the seals, gaskets, rubber etc having to with
fuel/air in the engine compartment on Sunday.  I'd like to tackle the
underside now.

Can someone confirm these fuel hose sizes for me?

pressure regulator to tank return: 5.5mm

tank to fuel filter: 5.5mm

fuel filter to heater tee to fuel pump: 10mm

fuel pump to 3/4 fuel rail: 7mm or is it 5.5mm?  The fuel pump end seems to
be 5.5mm but the fuel rail seems to be 7mm.

Also, I took off the two metal fuel lines underneath back in Feb because
they were clogged with sludge.  There is a z shaped piece and I can't
remember which side it goes on.  Does it go between the fuel pump and the
3/4 fuel rail?
