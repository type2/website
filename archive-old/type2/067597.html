  If it's the unit I have it's not bad for what it is, but.

  It uses a standard size bottle of propane and a disposible oxygen bottle
  the same size.  The oxygen bottle only lasts about 20 minutes and are $8
  a piece.

  You need the oxygen to get the hot flame so it would get expensive
  quickly to try and weld.  I used mine to braise my seat frames where
  broken when I rebuilt them.  Before I got a MIG welder.

  Braising is like soldering only stronger.  You don't melt the materials
  you are joining, you use a brass/bronze ??? filler rod that melts and
  joins the pieces.   Strong but not as strong as a weld.

  I got my Lincoln MIG welder, MD100  (110v) at Home Depot for $288.  This
  uses the wire with innershield gas.  It is like another $100 for the
  conversion kit to use the solid wire and bottled shielding gas (plus the
  cost of the bottle of gas), that is the next step I'll do.  Used a
  friends unit with the gas and much cleaner weld bead.

Although I'm lobbying for all my friends and relations to collaborate and
buy me a welder for Xmas, I'm getting little eye contact and many arched
eyebrows, which makes me think I will probably get socks again.

So I'm looking through an industrial supply catalog and I come across a
little propane-oxygen torch setup. It says this thing burns at 4600
degrees, and it says it can braise, weld or cut. I don't even know what
braising is.

Could this possibly weld body panels? I'm not looking for show-quality
stuff, just rust repair that will hold up. The gas setup is a LOT cheaper
than a real welder.
