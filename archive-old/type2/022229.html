I got the bus pulled to Byesville, Ohio (thanks Mike Mott for the tip on
Beetle Barn there) and took Greyhound home. Jim at Beetle Barn says the bus
isn't worth fixing, but the engine, a recent rebuild that's always run
well, is still fine, and most of the camper stuff is in OK shape (the
fridge is a bit askew).

I wasn't carrying collision (stupid, stupid), so no insurance company is
buying it.

If anyone in that area wants to take the bus off my hands to scavenge the
engine and assorted parts, maybe for your own camper conversion (I might do
it myself except the time isn't right for me), give me a holler. Otherwise
I'll get it home somehow and try to peddle it here.

$500 OBO. It's sitting at Beetle Barn if you want to look at it; it's the
yellow-and-white one with the smashed front end, no windshield and Kansas
plate. Drop me a pmail if you want directions.

Best regards,
