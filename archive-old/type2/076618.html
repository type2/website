Subject: RE: [T2] Vacuum advance: dizzy requirements vs. actual vacuum

&gt;You probably should say what dizzy and carb you're using.

Good point, Andrew.

To the extent this information would affect the expected manifold vacuum: it's a stock 1600 single port engine, with a 30/31 carb (the carb sold as a stock 
replacement these days) and an aftermarket SVDA distributor from aircooled_dot_net.

What is the expected manifold vacuum on this engine?  No one knows?  

Like I say, since the dizzy requires 30cm Hg for full advance and my carb's vacuum takeoff is only pulling 15cm, I'm trying to figure out if this is a problem.  Is it 
comparable to the light produced by a bulb that requires 12v on a system that is only putting out 6v?
