Alex,

The symbol on your switch, eye lens with lines radiating, May be the switch that supplies power to your rear interior light.  On my 74 Westy, it powers the flourescent on the left side above the table.  The flourescent also has a switch on it, but will not work without the dash switch pulled on.
