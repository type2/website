Subject: VW cad file

A while back I think I sent a  CAD .dwg or a .dxf of my version of the AIRS
logo (an older version, without the lights or the cross) to somebody on the
list.  I just got a computer upgrade at work, and forgot to save that CAD
file back to the server.  It was my 'splash screen' in one of the drawing
packages.  I miss seeing the bus smile at me during the day.

Has anyone out there still got it?  I'll take it in most any vector form.

Thanks (I hope).
