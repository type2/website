Hey Spunky,

I had the same problem a couple of weeks ago.

Do you have any of the stud sticking out?  If not, you'll have to drill it
out or use a tapping kit.  If you do have some of the stud sticking out,
have you tried soaking it with liquid wrench + heat (I used BernzOMatic
Torch) + vice grips?  Also, there are multiple tools designed for this.
Check the Muir Manual in chapter XVI.  Also, check the archives.\

If all else fails, put the nut up on the stud.  Take a socket slightly
smaller than the stud.  Heat the stud.  Use a hammer to bang the socket onto
to the stud.  Once it is securely on there, heat up the top of the stud and
slowly use your rachet to take the stud out.  If the stud doesn't stay on,
it usually burs up the threads bad enough that you can twist the nut and
take out the stud.

Until Later,
