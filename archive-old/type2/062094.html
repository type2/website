Subject: tie rod toe in adjustment.

$40 to do toe in?

Gee, when I replaced the tie rod ends on a previous vw, just do it as per
St Muir and MEASURE distance between front of wheels and back of wheels-
easy to do with a telescoping set of curtain rods and a marker- mark the
gap at front, then check rear- mark should be a little MORE visible!!
As I recall, I set the steering arm in center of its travel first, centered
steering wheel (if it was centered before), then did the tie rod check.
