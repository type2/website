Subject: 82 stranded 20 miles out/// Tag A Long Tours, Moab, UT

 Hey ALL, 

I have an 82 westie air cooled.  It has been great to me for th elast year
and a half but I know I am  due for some trouble (aren't we all?).    I left
Friday evening after work for a weekend trip to the deserts of southern 
Utah.  All went well.  I arrived at 1:00 am about 50 miles into the San
Rafael Swell desert.  I found an isolated area where I could lay down
and sleep.  I camped overnight and then met up with my friends at a pre
determnined place.  We had a great camp site.  Clear and cool all
weekend, an almost full moon and no one else around for miles.  Makes
ya want to howl at the moon.  

In search of the camp site I traveled up some pretty gnarly dirt 4wd
roads (old uranium mining roads litter the deserts of southern Utah). 
Thinking this would be a terrible place to break down, I back tracked and
set up camp about 2 miles off the MAIN dirt road.

On Sunday morning I started the bus up to head home.  Started right up.  I
remember thinking great another trouble free trip!!   I let it warm up a bit
and then turned it around.  It stalled and that was that.  Could not get it
started.  

I played with the thing a while trying to figure it out.  NO LUCK.  Changed
the fuel filter as I thought I had heard the pump struggling earlier that
week.  DID NOT HELP although the filter was full of rust like debris.  I
checked for spark and it was OK.  Didn't have a compression tester or
anything else.  The other party wanted to get going so I abandoned my
beloved bus.

Luckily my friends did not leave.  They almost did.  20 miles off pavement
would be a long walk out.   My friend had a family of four with her and
they were heading elsewhere but I ended up catching a ride all the way
home with them.  Felt like I was kidnaped by the ADAMS FAMILY.  It is a
standing joke now.

In Salt lake I rented a car dollie and hauled it all 250 miles back down
yesterday using my  old reliable 1976 Lincoln continental with the 460 Cu
inch engine.  It actually made it into the desert only dragging bottom a few
times in washes and retrieved the bus.  I got it all back home in one piece
last night about 2 am.  YEA!!!

So now I will set out to  figure out the reason.  Any ideas would be
appreciated.  It started fine, sounded fine.  Stalled out during the
turnaround and then would not start.  It turned over fine, had fuel, but
sounded bad when turning over. It would make a loud bang occasionally
but not with each turn.  I thought maybe the number 1 cylinder may have
eaten a valve.   A friend of mine thinks it could be the points got dusty.  I
will check it out tonight and get back to the list.

At least now I know why I keep that dang Lincoln around.  Everyone I
know aleways suggests that I sell it an dump the money into the bus.  I
think I keep it to retrieve my other lost cars.  It pulled the westi home
trouble free at 50 mph up or down hills( 250 miles).  I was amazed.  Total
tow cost 130 plus a day off work.  (Didn't wanna be there anyway on
Monday)  All for now, wish me luck!

PS: A while back some one asked about a tour company in Moab Utah
who used to use  23 window buses in Moab for tours of red rock
country.  I think the company is called Tag A long Tours.  From what I
know I think the guy has retired all of the buses and now uses 4WD
truck and jeeps.  I think he may still have them sitting around. (This could
be a rumor or there could be some good parts or restos) Anyway, from
the Moab phone book.
