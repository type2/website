Subject: RE: [T2] VW logo mud flaps

&gt;Does anyone know where I can get rear mud flaps just like this?
&gt;http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/.Pictures/Mudflaps.jpg

I got mine from the Bus Depot.  They are really thick and heavy and look
like they will last forever, now if I would only put them on my bus.
