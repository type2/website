&gt;Yup, nothing has changed.  It's just like marketing almost anywhere in 
&gt;the world - unless it is *THEIR* idea, it's a no go.
&gt;
&gt;So guys, since Alldata has apparently crapped out, what do *WE* need to 
&gt;do to put out our own CD-ROM?

I've got a CD-ROM burner at work. Not sure how many I could knock off as 
it's not for high volume production, but this sure would be an 
interesting idea to pursue.

Also, since I work for a software company and we're in the process of 
burning our software on CD's, I'd be willing to check out the rough 
price. I'm pretty sure that it's under or around the $2/disk mark.
