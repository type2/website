Now that I have your attention...

We were talking Bus Fantasies, weren't we?

I'd forget Westfalia, Devon, Sundial and all those second cousins
to the basic bus, and do what VW did several times:  turn the
basic Type 2 over to Ghia designers and the Karmann Karosserie
for a hand-made Transporter with a little more in the rear and a
little smoother package.  Eeww, and maybe a drop-top version.

On second thought, why try to improve perfection?

While I'm talking Ghia, I'll take the opportunity to say I put
$500 down on a '64 Type 34 Ghia this morning.  $500 when I
trailer it home and it's mine!  The ad was correct when it said
no rust!  Pardon me, still walking a few inches off the ground.

Speaking of ground, as I crawled around underneath the 3Ghia, I
noticed that the heat exhangers were wrapped with the same
vinyl/asbestos-type wrap that buses have on the center heat tube.
I have never seen a &quot;wrapped&quot; heat exchanger before.  Has anyone
else?
