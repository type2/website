Subject: checking for brake fluid leaks

Hi again everyone
I was going to bleed my brakes today, and noticed that the fluid level was 
low. So, I wanted to repair the system before bleeding it. Any advice on how 
to check for the leak? and any advice for bleeding the brakes. I have a 
general idea of what I'm doing. (did it once on an 81 Ford F150)
Thanks,
Kyle
