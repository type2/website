  Hi Folks.

  You may remember about a month ago I stated that the spark plug for #2
cylinder (73 Westy 1700cc) was not reaching 22 ft lbs. torque. I had
replaced plugs and was removing #2 and noticed it was tighter than normal
coming out. I installed a new plug but as it began to (I thought) bottom the
torque increased to about 12 lbs. and remained there for another turn of the
torque wrench. I was sure the plug was stripping the threads outta the head.
I thought I'd leave it till I found inserts tools time, etc, to repair.
   That brings us to last night. Got home from a 12 hr shift , backed the
bus into the garage and began to remove the R/H carb,manifold,etc.etc. to
allow the 1/2 cylinder bank shroud to be pulled up for access to the plug.
Got that done and pulled the plug.
It came out fairly tight(running torque?) and after I sprayed down the
threads in the head, to my suprise they are perfect!!! Reinstalled the plug
and torqued to 22 ft. lbs.
  Since I pulled everything to access the head I retorqued all the nuts as
I've had a blowby problem on that side since the head replacement 2 years
ago.
  Today I reassembled everything and helicoiled a loose stud hole for the
intake manifold. Another improvement was to replace the short vacuum line
between the balance tube and intake manifolds. This as well as the intake
manifold stud repair has made the bus run a good as ever:))
Thanks everyone for the suggestions on repairing the spark plug threads
insitu.
I now have the tools and inserts for future use!

   Later
