I belive this man to be an impostor.

I belive during this second adventure that we have been duped by a
writer/philosopher as opposed to the original Doktor; whom I think that we
can all agree was a mechanic/philosipher.

I have carefully indexed an cross referenced all of his original postings
from his original incarnation as compared to the postings of his second
coming. When caompared in this meticulous manner it becomes instantly
obvious to a scholard eye that they are from different, but similar people.

I would challenge this alleged imposteor to reveal his tru identity, or be
forever compromised by this challenge.

Big time bust ass a-coming for me 'till after the holiday. Don't need 2000
&gt; e-mails fer blanket download and delete waitin' on Tuesday.
&gt;
&gt; P-mails whenever you like, I'll respond on Tuesday if I don't see it by
&gt; Thursday PM.
&gt;
&gt; If your drivin' this weekend, know there will be apes out there who spent
&gt; the afternoon a bathin' in the mash tun.  Don't be a-reachin' fer the
&gt; sunglasses nor trying to clean them while yer drivin'. Pay attention,
&gt; think, prepare, survive the clear and present dangers of the road and the
&gt; ones a-hidin' waitin' fer you at any particular convienient second that
&gt; might crop up on the biggest apes in bumpercars ritual of the year.
&gt;
&gt; God's grace protect you all and with a little help from you, keep you
safe.
