Subject: Vanagon Question

I bought my wife an 84 Vanagon for the winter, she wanted some heat  
this year.   On one of the rear sliding windows, the window latch  
(cubic looking thing you push down) is missing.   I've searched the  
'net, but haven't found them. Anyone know if these are available.

I'd go to a pull a part, but I'm homebound in a wheelchair for the  
next few months.
