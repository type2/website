Subject: Looking for type 4 tin piece

I am looking for the piece of tin that was on a late bus with type 4 motor
that had a dealer installed air conditioner...yes, the cut out one.  I would
rather not fool with cutting out myself..........they had a template they
used, and did a much nicer job..........

I will keep the list posted as I attempt to put a sanden compressor and r134
hoses into my restoration.......
