Subject: '73 chassis numbers

Hi, I am a little confused when it comes to chassis numbers.

Bentley says the exhaust valve clearance for Dual-carburetor engines:
through chassis number:  213 2210 553 is .006&quot;
and from chassis number: 213 2210 554 is .008&quot;

My chassis number is 233 2169 609, so what should I set the exhaust valves to?

Thanks,

Charley
