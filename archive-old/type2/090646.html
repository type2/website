Subject: '78 (TN to ME)

My friend Jeff just evolved from the murky waters of
his Vanagon to breathe the air of a green, 78 Westy he
purchased off ebay (if you're interested, the link is
below). He flies out tomorrow to Tennessee to pick it
up and drive it back to Maine. Please keep an eye out
for him and give him a Mod Squad, Link-esque,
solid-arm-out-the-window-hello if you see him heading
north.

I believe this is his first air-cooled vehicle so if
you happen to run into him, do as I did and tell him
to keep it under a hundred.
