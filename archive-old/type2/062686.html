Hi folks,

I plan on hitting the Woodstock, NY show this Sunday, Sept. 8.  I'm looking
for a pair of front seats with headrests out of a 73, 74, or 75 bus.  If
anyone is going and has a pair of seats to sell email me in advance.  I have
a straight, near rustless driver's side door (light blue color) for a
baywindow bus that I could bring if someone is interested in trading for
seats/buying.

I don't know what hurricane Fran plans for us on Sunday--hopefully we'll
have a clear day.
