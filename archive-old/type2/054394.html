d*mn heavy.  although it would depend a lot on how stripped it is. a long
block is about 125lbs (from when I shipped one) but it approaches 300lbs
when all decked out and an auto tranny feels just as heavy. don't know
about a manual tranny haven't lifted one in ages

&gt; I am looking to transport these pieces with a few
&gt; buddies and am trying to figure out if its under
&gt; the payload limits for my bus. ;)

I have carried em around in my bus, (78 auto tranny) I put the engine on
the floor between the wheels and the tranny over the engine in the rear.
but the bus was fine
