Subject: $900 bumper? -fiberglass repair?

Not sure I posted about my &quot;bump&quot; in a VW caravan of busses- but while
backing up, I bumped Sven Schultz&quot;s  87 Vanagon and created a tiny star
crack and a feathering of the edge (about 2&quot; long) of this simulated
&quot;rubber surround&quot; that was just a mould in the fiberlass bumper cover.  He
just got it (looked new) and said it was $600 for the cover and $300
labor-????????? I said I'd pay to have the cracks filled and repainted, but
his 2 estimates are for over $300 labor and replacement of the cover (ins.
co got it down to $648 with a &quot;like new&quot; bumper.)  I want to pay him (Sven
Schultz) out of pocket because anything over $500 in this _at_^#%%$ state of
NJ would risk my being dropped and a total increase in my rates of $720
over 3 yrs for a #&amp;$$%^little bump- btw, if it were $5000 or more, would be
same increase- no wonder we pay outrageous rates!
    Can't fiberglass be ground, filled, and sanded +painting with out the
damn labor of pulling the cover?  Our Nissan had a giant crack from deer
damage in the plastic bumper, and with filling/painting it looks like new
for about $200!
