Subject: Re: Help: how do you remove oil seal?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.91.990328170758.30554A-100000_at_Sherlock.SIMS.Berkeley.EDU&gt;

The first time I removed an oil seal from a 2.0L engine I used a small 
claw hammer that happened to be around.  Put the claw behind the oil 
seal, braced the head on the crank (maybe padded with a thin piece of 
wood) and levered the seal right out.

They have oil seal pullers that are thin metal tools, with a head with 
2 claws of different sizes.  Around $7 or $8 at most FLAPS.

&gt; One of the jobs is to replace the large oil seal behind the flywheel. I've
&gt; got the clutch, flywheel et al off okay, and I've carefully scraped most of
&gt; the seal off using a knife, but the outer part of the rubber ring is firmly
&gt; stuck between the crankcase and that funny metal ring (is it a seal
&gt; retainer or something?).
&gt; 
&gt; Now, do you have to split the crankcase to get his seal out, or can I do it
&gt; without having to? If so, how? I've had a look in the archives, with no
&gt; specific info. MY Haynes manual says it is possible, but doesn't say how.
