1970 Westies, as follows:

Casper is an A in heart, and a B in visual concepts.
Engine = A+
Interior = A-
Exterior = B+
Charisma = A+

NewBus is an A in visual concepts, but with an untested heart.
Engine = A+
Interior = A
Exterior = A
Charisma = Jealous of Casper and makes fun of Casper being Gay.
