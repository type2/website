Subject: Re: [T2] Putting on Michelin LTX LT 195/75R-14/C tires...

&gt; Stopped by America's Tire Store this morning looking into getting Mich MXT's
&gt; as most have recommended.
&gt; Big problem, they don't have them anymore.
&gt; not in a 195 or a 205.

the name has been changed I think to Agilis something or other
but I had to get em special ordered (the MXT) from Nevada, several stores
told me they didn't exist and they weren't in the computer database but
they were there with a little search and visiting several tire stores
finally got em from NTB.

&gt; They did a little research and came up with the LTX as being the new best
&gt; choice.

Don't think so..I seem to recall them trying to sell me those too. 
make sure what ever you get has the correct weight rating

the MXT's are 99S weight rated

&gt; It must be a major ego blow to a tire salesman for a customer to put off

and to his commission

&gt; Price is 89.00 per plus all the incidentals.  I can do that.  But I want to
&gt; make sure they are good tires for our application.

doesn't sound right, the MXT's were over $100 each BEFORE mounting,
balance, etc   not a cheap tire, but IMO well worth it.

&gt; BTW: It's a 72 Westy, completely stock.

that's one heavy van so get the right weight rating or learn how to handle
it when you have a blow out at speed due to tire failure (ask me how I
know) 

good luck
