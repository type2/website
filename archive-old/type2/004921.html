Ok I had a chance to really see what was going on tonight here's the
deal......

The outer CV joint on the right side is completly fubar (what a mess)....
BUT, when I have the van in neutral the driveshaft is still turning on the
right (broken) side... something still doesnt seem right here... I just
don't see the drive and the cv going at the same time ya know? not to metion
the tranny was recently resealed.
