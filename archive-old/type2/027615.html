Hey, a couple of you wrote about replacing a Westy's rear driver's window 
(with vent wing) for the passenger rear side (the one covering the closet on 
a 69) to get rid of the leaky vent wing.

What do you use for rubber? The passenger rear side rubber, but flipped? Or 
is there a piece for that side. And, is that glass flat, so it swaps over no 
prob?

Jason

69 Westy - just picked it up, pics and story to come.
