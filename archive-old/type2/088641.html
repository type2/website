Subject: Re: [T2] Dixie Bus Gathering Report and Pix (Very Long)

But if this gathering is in Ohio, why is it called the DIXIE bus gathering?

&gt; Doug Zannis

Hey Doug,
You are not spoiling any fun!  The author of the song Dixie, was written by
a Yankee.  His name is Daniel Decatur Emmet and he is from Mt Vernon Ohio.
The city has had a large festival the last 15 years to celebrate, and it was
this past weekend.
Since I fly a rebel flag when camping, and since I picked the weekend to
coincide with the COVVC show and the Dixie Days Festival, I named it The
Dixie Bus Gathering.
Have Fun!!
