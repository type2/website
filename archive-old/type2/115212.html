the first attempt at sending this message didnt work, so here goes. I 
removed all of the reply comments, maybe that will help.


Thanks Jason, and to the gentleman that called me yesterday, sorry I forgot 
your name.

Well, the bus is sold. I paid $250 for the 79 motor that was supposed to be 
in good condition, spent $1130 getting it up to par and installed, replacing 
all fuel lines, swapping my exhaust over onto it/etc, but it just didn't pan 
out.

So, looking back, I wish I would have sold it the first time around when I 
thought I had. Looking a little less back, I wish I had taken that lowball 
offer for $700 the day I bought the &quot;good&quot; motor but before I paid to have 
it installed.

I loved this bus, and I tried to do anything and everything I could to keep 
it, but in the end, it wasn't in the cards. It was my first Westy, I was 
engaged in it, I took my honeymoon in it, and I probably invested around 
four grand at least into it over the exactly two years I owned it.

It was worth every penny, and I'll own another one someday.

I need to find an airline ticket in the next few days so I can fly back to 
Minneapolis instead of the drive I had hoped to be taking. I willl  unsub 
from the list at that time, hopefully to rejoin in the not too too distant 
future.

Spanks for the memories.



Christopher
76 Westfalia &quot;jasper&quot; - hopefully gone to a good home. I'll miss ya.
199,998 miles, we almost made it buddy.
