Subject: sending unit question
Mime-Version: 1.0

can someone answer a question for me?  i'm getting an oil pressure gauge 
and sending unit for my bus (VDO.)  i want to get the sending unit with the 
terminal for the idiot light AND the gauge.

so, simply speaking....if the picture of the gauge has 2 pointy things on 
one end, and opposite is the end that fits into the engine....this is a 
dual gauge for the purpose i am seeking?!

i've been bidding on one from an auction site, and the picture appears to 
be the one i am seeking (by my &quot;technical&quot; description,) but the seller 
told me the 2nd terminal is a ground.

anyone have any input?
