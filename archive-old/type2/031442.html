&gt; problem.  I pretty sure I understand the procedure for turning the torsion 
&gt; bars, but I've never done it before. What I would like to know is if anyone 
&gt; has on the net or at home any kind of step by step instructions for this.  I 
&gt; remember someone talking about it a couple of weeks ago, but I've deleted 
&gt; all of that.  Thanks for any help in this.  This is actually bothering me 

a side question here, My van came with the &quot;Deluxe&quot; torsion bars, but the
vehicle was modified and is considerably heavier, I have aquired a set of
the heavy duty torsion bars. 

  is there any special things to know for switching them, is it just a
straight swap??
