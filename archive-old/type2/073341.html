&gt;    Hello Everyone, when I pulled the valve covers off my heads during
&gt;disassembly I found no retaining springs holding the pushrod tubes.  Is their
&gt;absence highly unusual?  The tubes stayed in place fine without them (they
&gt;would not push through the heads with considerable force).  Will it be
&gt;necessary to replace the springs during reassembly?  I have a 1700 engine.
&gt;Any ideas appreciated.

Since VW designed that engine and found it necessary to include the
retaining wires (&quot;parts left out cost nothing and cause no service
problems&quot;) I would not run without them except in an emergency.  If this is
such a situation, I would at least use some silicone on the pushrod tube
seals to lessen the chance that a pushrod tube will come loose.

Whether or not you remove the silicone when you obtain the wires is up to
you.  Although I am in favor of NOT putting the silicone on in ordinary
circumstances, it may not be worth your trouble to remove it, especially if
you have no leaks.
