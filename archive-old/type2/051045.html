&lt;&lt; I have the 66 that I'm gonna go start on this weekend.  First question is 
 this.  I am going to use a later model motor a 1300 from a bug year 72.  I 
 know this motor will bolt right in but the starter and flywheel are 6 volt.  
 Will the 6 volt pressure plate and clutch kit mount up to the newer case? &gt;&gt;

I remember having a european 1300 block and found the clutch to be similar in 
size 
to a 6volt 40horse clutch. I would first try to get away with just changing 
the flywheel to a 6 volt and using the 1300 clutch, but then again, I could 
be totally wrong....
