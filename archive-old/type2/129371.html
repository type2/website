Subject: Adjusting stove burner mixture?

The Seppelfricke model 113.1 stove in our newly-acquired 84 Westie seems 
to want a burner adjusted. One burner operates well: a nice blue flame, 
not too large. The other puts out a lot more flame and it is not just 
blue, but has yellow tips -- how do you adjust these things?

PS -- got the leaking LPG regulator replaced -- a shop in town amazingly 
had the replacement part in stock, knew how to install it, and had the 
time to do it over lunch. A miracle.

Best regards,
