Subject: Re: [T2] Does the grim reaper drive a bus?

Funny thing is, my brother-in-law said &quot;you're gonna burst into flames
and die&quot; when I told him I got a bus.  Screw him, I feell 100% safer
in my bus than I do in his GMC truck.

Besides, if the Grim Reaper drove a bus, we'd live to be 150!

Later,
