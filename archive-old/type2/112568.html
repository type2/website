Subject: Cap/Rotor?

Got a brand new cap and rotor That I originall bought for my 79 Westy years ago 
and wanted to put it on my 69. I've looked at the caps and both have the same 
Bosch #'s on them (1235522056) and the rotors also have the same #'s 
(1234332215)on them but they also have different markings that make me wonder 
if they are sifferent in some way I cannot tell. The new stuff is orange in 
color and clearly has Bosch written on it and the old just has the little Bosch 
logo. The new rotor has 4.5 and R5 stamped on it with a little #985 that is 
encircled. The old rotor has .08 and R5 on it and the #6, it also has the #270 
encircled. I don't know if these parts are interchangeable or not. Also the 
metal contact that is inside where the rotor fit onto the shaft on the new 
rotor is about a 1/4&quot; longer. Maybe somebody out there has a clue cause I sure 
don't.
