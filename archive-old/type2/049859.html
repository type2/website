&gt;&gt;you'll see a piece of metal with a big slot in the top and a spring sticking
&gt;&gt;out of it. That's the pinion.), turn it around and put it back in.
&gt;
&gt;This is risky.  There will likely be a washer under the pinion, and if you
&gt;remove the pinion the washer may fall into the crankcase.
&gt;Just rotate your plug wires 180 degrees and drive it, IMO.

Although I certainly won't get into an AVP quality discussion, David is
right, the washer dropping is always a risk.  But I've pulled a lot of those
out and never had one drop off...  Certainly doesn't matter one damn bit
where the dizzy aligns though as he mentions just as long as you get
the right wire to the right place, T4's don't retard #3 obviously.

Just depends how bold you're feeling really, I like to have my distributor
can pointing in the right direction with the plug wires runing to the right
locations to avoid confusion if I sell the car.
