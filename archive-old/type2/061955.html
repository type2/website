I'm feeling *so* musical ...

Junkers and Rot (to the tune of &quot;American Pie&quot; by Don McLean)


A long, long time ago.  I can still remember when the Busses ran on 
leaded gas.  
And I knew if I had my chance, I would give a sideways glance and see my 
dream Bus (one with all the glass).  
The Sunday paper was delivered.  I called on Busses, they were 
considered.  Some were bought, some given.  The count?  It reached eleven. 

My friends they yelled and others cried, when they heard about my latest 
find.  
A Split so nice, the paint still shines.  Today I call it ... mine. 

So bye-bye all you junkers and rot.  Some to Kevin, some to Heaven (via
crusher, why not?) And them good 'ol bones may help a Splitty that's shot. 
I still need to sell two Busses I've got.
