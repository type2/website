&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello list and all auto tranny lovers.  Can the transmission be pulled by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; itself without motor?  Or is it easier to pull as a complete unit with
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; You have to pull the transmission with the engine.  Won't come out
&gt; &gt; &gt; otherwise.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Auto tranny engines can and do come out alone, do it all the time, the
&gt; &gt; auto tranny doesn't have the long power shaft so it doesn't have to be
&gt; &gt; pulled back any more than needed to clear the studs on the bottom of the
&gt; &gt; engine.
&gt; 
&gt; The question was &quot;can the transmission be pulled by itself&quot;.  I still
&gt; think that the answer is &quot;no&quot;.

your right, the tranny cannot be pulled by itself, what I'm trying to say
is pull em as two distinct units, pull the engine, THEN pull the tranny
