Subject: Pop top 

Hello all,
  I was in a local 'recyclers' yard and ran into a 73 Bus
with a pop top. It is a small top, maybe 5 foot square, it
pops up straight, canvas is crapo tan/orange. I did some
surching and it looks like it may be a Riviara(ASI). It
looks just like the one in the adds on the Wet Westies
site. The interior is gone, basicly all that is left is the
pop top. The yard wants $50 for it. Is this resonable? It
seems to be in good condition. Would it work on top of my
74 Kombi?(it has no sunroof hole yet) It would be nice to
have the extra room to stand up when I finaly convert it to
a camper.
  Any information would be helpful, thanks.
