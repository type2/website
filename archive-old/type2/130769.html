Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof drain

Hi Mike,

There is no water seal for the roof. It is designed to drain off 
through the drain holes. If they are plugged, then water will back up 
and puddle upstairs until it finds a way into the bus. There is a soft 
felt seal, but its only purpose is to keep debris from jamming the 
gears and to keep the big metal parts moving smoothly.

Be careful unplugging the drains. The metal drains at the front are 
about 6&quot; long, after which they are connected to vinyl hoses. On my 
wife's sunroof bus one of these hoses had become disconnected, and the 
water was running into the bus through the headliner, which had 
mildewed and decomposed. It was an eas job to re-connect this hose, but 
the headliner will never be the same. I plan to replace the headliner 
with a 68-72 westy headliner instead.


Happy trails,
