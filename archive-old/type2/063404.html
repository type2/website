It should work.  The sender has a plastic stop on it that slides up and
down the dipstick part.  You remove your dipstick and place it alongside
the sender, then slide the plastic stop such that the sender will extend
the same length down the tube.  There's a set screw on the plastic stop
to hold it in position.  Then you scratch marks on the sender that line
up with those on the original dipstick for add and full.  If you leave a
little extra wire (not enough to get tangled in things), you can check the
oil level without disconnecting anything.
