Subject: Re German FI pumps; water in gas

To Dr Tim &amp; list: I can attest to the quality of German FI electric fuel
pumps- got 211,000 mi on my original now!  (Hell, the rest of the engine
is original also!)  Any reasons?  Well, I NEVER have let the bus run out
of gas (even with the flaky sender-just keep good records), and do
change the filter.  Also keep it topped up to minimize condensate. Which
leads me to ask- My old tractor has a simple low-sitting glass bowl in
the fuel line just below the tank outlet, and you can see any water
collecting, as it sits in the bottom, letting the gas pass out
horizontally above it- anyone do that in their line? Also, why are most
fuel filters NOT transparent plastic?
