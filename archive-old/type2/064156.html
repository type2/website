Subject: smelly leaky brakes

How y'all doin! Last week I wrote about how I adjusted my brakes and one of
them (left rear) was greasy and dirty. A listmember (Michael Perry)
suggested that I smell the greasy dirt to determine whether it was brake
fluid or gear oil. Well, I smelled it, and it is gear oil. I take it this
means that there is a leaky seal between my reduction box and the brake
drum, right? It looks like I'm going to have to change my rear brake shoes,
too, as I'm starting to hear grindy scrapy noises back there when I apply
the brakes or pull the emergency brake while I am moving (that's how I
could tell it was the rear brakes). I guess my questions are: 1) does this
sound like a correct diagnosis (brake and seal problems); 2) is this
something I can do by myself, or should I take it somewhere, close my eyes,
and sign the check? How much should I expect to spend, given the limited
amount of info?

&quot;do it myself&quot; arguments:

save the big bucks
&quot;learning&quot; experience

&quot;go to the pros&quot; arguments

I have to buy:
46 mm socket
breaker bar wrench
jack stands
replacement parts
beer

will take at least 1/2 weekend

brakes are important (no room for error)

did I mention the time problem?

Anyway, I will accept all advice, then decide. I can ride my bike to the
bus stop if I have to, so I'm not in a tremendous hurry. Heck, maybe I'll
get some more body work done if it's stuck in the driveway :). I guess I
can cut corners and buy Schaefer instead of Miller High Life (I'm not
making this up).

Thanks in advance,

Thought of the day...
&quot;You'd have to sniff a lot of brake shoes to get asbestosis&quot;
