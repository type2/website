Subject: re:of benches and buckets

I can only speak from what I know but my AW as does Nikkis has a structural
bar that runs across the &quot;top&quot; of the bus also at this point, directly above
the partition. It is the outer lip of the over cab storage compartment(luv
those AdventureWagens!) I toyed with getting rid of the compartment and
doing some mods but read that the bar is a structural piece. All in all I
couldnt see what harm it would be removing the bench and mounts. Then again
not seeing the harm is the key phrase. If we always saw the harm nothing
would ever go wrong! :)
