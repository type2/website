&gt; I have no doubt you could do a nice job without a spray gun.
&gt; I have, in my vast collection of collectables, an old Sherwin- Williams
&gt; product guide that details painting auto (Circa 1925!). It starts out &quot; the
&gt; key to a good finish is a high quality brush&quot;!
&gt; I'm sure you could still do such a thing with SOLID color paints (no metallics
&gt; or micas).

You'd need to use something inexpensive (tractor paint?) if you wanted to
paint your Bus with a brush. I did a calculation on total film thickness of
that high-priced auto paint I like. For a standard paint job consisting of
corrosion-resistant underprimer, gray standard primer, color coat and
topcoat, Akzo Nobel states maximum film thickness is as follows:

One coat Sikkens Washprimer CR--        0.0004&quot;
Three coats Sikkens Autosurfacer 940HS--0.0066&quot;
Two coats Sikkens Autocryl--            0.0042&quot;
Two coats Sikkens Autoclear--           0.0020&quot;

Total film thickness--                  0.0132&quot;

I was sanding some rust off Edelstein the other day and applying lacquer
primer (which will be stripped off later) with a paintbrush to keep new rust
down to a minimum, and the film (from just one coat) looks like it's a lot
thicker than .0132&quot;. So what? The thicker the film is, the more paint it
takes to achieve it. Even that budget PPG paint we discussed last week runs
$100 a gallon, and you'll need a full gallon to paint a Bus if you're
spraying.

It might be a lot cheaper just to rent a spray setup from a tool rental
place, or to buy a top-notch airless sprayer and polish the heck out of the
paint once it's on. I painted a motorcycle with an airless sprayer once, it
came out really nice.

BTW, lacquer topcoat is NLA. Thank the EPA for that one.
