Greetings -

I can't remember if I found a road test on a 71 bus through type2, but I did
see one on-line that measured the Bus at a maximum of 68mph (the speedometer
indicated 72 or 74 - I forget). This was a standard Bus.

It's hard to believe, I know.

I'll see if I can dig up that website if I have some time.
