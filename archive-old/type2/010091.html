&gt;When I pump my brake pedal the first time I stop the way I have come to
expect my bus to stop. If you pump the pedal a couple of times you have
better pressure and &quot;more stop&quot;.  What up?&lt;

&gt;&gt;Adjust your rear brakes. You are doing your stopping on the fronts only
until you pump them up. Turn each star wheel til the wheel locks then back
off 3 clicks.  The reason the pedal comes up as you pump is you are
overcoming the springs pulling the shoes back with brake fluid pressure.&lt;&lt;


Hey All --
This thread reminded me of an ongoing question I've always had regarding
the rear brake adjusting stars:  Does anybody have a foolproof guideline
for determining which way to turn the right/left stars each time?  
Each time I do it I seem to always have it backwards.  Muir attempts this
but I find the description confusing.   Thanks in advance for any tips you
can give...
