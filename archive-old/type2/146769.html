Subject: Re: [T2] Goodbye type2... 79 Westy for sale

&gt;I pressed a bunch of buttons,, and when I finally got sound..... the radio
&gt;station was playing Greatful Dead  , Magic Bus!   How appropriate!

Jamie,
the next time you're down south, we need to have some remedial 60's 
music appreciation. . . Magic Bus is a great tune but it was done by The 
Who, not the Dead. . . enjoyed your great bus rescue TR. . .
