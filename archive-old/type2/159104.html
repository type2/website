Subject: door panel clips wanted !

Hi Volks,
I was looking to buy door panel clips like the one you can find in Gowesty:
http://www.gowesty_dot_com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=251-867-299&amp;Category_Code=vp-i-p-misc
  and was wondering if:
1)  Its $0.95  for  one item only ? (well I already send an email to them )
2) I plan to installed some thin RV carpet  ($20 from home depot)  in 
the sliding door and in the rear hatch and was wondering if those clips 
would be long enough when you take into account the carpet thickness. 
Thanks.

Chris, vanagon
