Subject: Re: [T2] Holding the long starter bolt

Hello Guys   What I do to hold the starter bolt is to put some dum-dum on the 
shaft some that it will stick in place,  On the old models that didn't have 
the self holding bolt I weld a bolt from an old exhust clamp across the head  
home made self holding bolt !! Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import
