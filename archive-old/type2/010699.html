Now that winter is coming, so are the questions about heat. I've been on this 
list 3 yrs or so, and every year questions come up about Back Seat Heat and 
even worse, the little dashboard heater. Let me be the first ( I think) this 
year to say: KEEP YOUR MONEY. They don't work, or at least they don't put out 
enough heat to make them a worthwhile purchase. The little dasboard 
&quot;heater/defroster&quot; will take hours to defrost your windshield, and may warm 
your fingers if you hold it in your hand for about 15 minutes. I drive 
sometimes with a propane heater going.Crazy? Yes. Other times I just accept 
the fact that I drive a vehicle with a poor heating system ( though I have 
been in Westy's that had decent heat output from intact, stock systems). I 
figure I'm at least more comfortable than the folks on motorcycles! Jeff S.

PS- If anyone doubts what I say about the dasboard heater/defroster, I've got 
one I'll sell you!
