&gt; You can keep the accessories with the engine if you don't change the

&gt; alternator then you sure as hell can't use the Bus fan housing.  And if

    Don't know about that, I've used the '73 alternator on the '81 fan
housing in my '73 bus. And also used the '81 alternator minus the fan
(no room) in my bus.


&gt; you can't use the Bus fan housing, you can't use the Bus heat
&gt; exchangers.  And if you can't use the Bus heat exchangers, then you
&gt; can't use the Bus exhaust.  Of course, all this is assuming you are
&gt; doing a proper installation.

     What a &quot;proper installation&quot; consists of for some people on the
list is clearly different for others. Depends on whether you are doing a
&quot;restoration&quot; or just looking for a ride. My bus is ride. When I'm able
to get a more pristine bus from some nice place like Ariz. I'll do a
restoration, but for this one it's all a hack. You're making the same
arguement that others do about &quot;if the VW engineers in their infinite
wisdom designed it that way, we should follow suit.&quot; So therefore,
putting extractors on our buses, Weber carbs, whatever, is bad, bad,
bad. Not! 
    I'll agree that a sealed up engine compartment is a good thing -- it
keeps all the slush, water from puddles, mud, leaves, and other crap
out. Or maybe it's real purpose is to help you float when you hit the
water -- which is what they used to say about the bugs. 8-) 
    But for engine longevity, I'll worry more about the essentials. My
last engine wasn't in a sealed compartment, and never got hot all last
Summer here in Mobile, AL -- had no problem at all with it until the fan
hub sheared the key and I got it out of time.
