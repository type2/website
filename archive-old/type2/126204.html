Subject: Re: [T2] Rusty Front Brakes?

No No No.  Never put anything oily on brake pads or rotors or drums or  
shoes.  Try as hard as you will there will always be some residual unless  you take 
the rotors off and immerse them in solvent.  A little rust will  come off 
after a few applications of the brakes.
