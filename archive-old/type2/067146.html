Subject: Re: Sunroof drainage? 

on my '78, I go to the carwash and take the high
pressure hose to the drains as follows:

front -- open the sunroof and apply hose directly
to drains which are at the front two corners of the
sunroof opening (outlets are plastic tubing protruding
from the bottom of the door post, i.e., at the bottom
of the vehicle)

rear -- spray into the outlets, which are plastic tubes
just visible at the top of the ventilation shaft; this
is messy and will result in some water in the compartment,
but it works.

in fact this procedure is as much a part of fall readiness
for me as is &quot;Golen'izing&quot; the wheel wells, waxing the
exterior, etc.
