Subject: Wandering timing???

My Bro-in-law (outlaw)  just called and said he put a timing light on his
'71 bus and the timing mark wandered from TDC to maybe 40 degrees Retarded
and anywhere in between.  He claims this all happened while it was idling,
he just sat there watching it move all over.
What is up????? Anybody seen that before?  Something weird inside the
Distributor?
Suggestions?

thanks, rex
