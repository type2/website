&gt; Alex, where are you photos of your homemade flywheel seal
&gt; installer?

Well first I should mention Mike Benthin as he deserves
credit for the homemade flywheel seal installer. It was his
idea to use an electrical junction box cover to press the
seal into place. I've just followed his instructions and
made my own. You can read his original post here:

Here's two photos of the one I made.

I've used the hammer and a block of wood method to install
a seal but I have to say I have more confidence in slowly
pressing in the seal now that i've used this tool.

If your are considering making one of your own a used metal
flywheel washer works well as a trace/guide to keep your
drilled holes spaced evenly.
