&gt; Pasadena to Phoenix can be one helluva windy ride.  That would be scary as

Good luck climbing out of the LA basin on I-10 on your way to Phoenix.
That's without towing a bus. There a very long windy stretch where I almost
overheated, going downhill. On the way up there are plenty of RVs pulled
over at the many stops having overheated. Many other kinds of vehicles also.

Not having a radiator doesn't mean it's any more fun.
