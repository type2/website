On our trip from GA to NH this summer in our '72 Bus we stayed at the
Lickdale Campground in Lickdale, PA.  It's located at the 'intersection' of
I-78 and I-81.  It's a private campground because none of the State Parks
in PA allow pets for overnight campers.  Apparently you can bring a pet in
if you are just visiting for the day.  So, if you have pets, you'll have to
find a private campground.

This campground is located on a river which is good for swimming and
fishing.  The tent sites are located at the back of the campground, but
they all get riverfront lots!  There is also a small island in the river,
but we didn't venture out to it.
