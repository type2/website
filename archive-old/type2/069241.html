Subject: Dellorto Carburators

 I have recently bought a '73 model bus with dual Dellorto Model FRD 34B 
carburetors.  I need to adjust the idle speed, and I have no idea where to 
start.  Does anyone know how to adjust these, and is there anyway that I could 
obtain an instruction book/sheet on these carbs?
