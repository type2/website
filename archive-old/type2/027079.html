It was said . . . .

&gt;I twisted gently back and forth until I could make them turn, then I folded
&gt;one of those rubber jar lid removers around the tube, grabbed on very 
&gt;gently
&gt;with a pair of pliers and pulled towards me until they slid out.  It took a
&gt;while and a lot of swearing, but I removed them all and only dented one
&gt;(which I replaced).

!!!  What !!!!  You replaced a push rod tube simply because you DENTED IT ! 
! !

Why not simply remove the dent ! ! !  ? ? ? ?

1 -  Clamp a solid piece of round bar steel to your work bench.  I use my 
dog legged lug wrench.  Pointy end + 6 inches of the lug wrench hanging out 
over the edge of the work bench, with dog legged end clamped down.

2 -  Slide the dented push rod tube over the pointy end of lug wrench.

3 -  Locate the dent over the top of the metal bar (lug wrench, in this 
case) and 'tap' fairly solid with hammer, or other metal, heavyish object.  
Move the push rod tube around, and continue tapping until you are satisfied. 
  Salt to taste.

The metal rod DOES NOT have to be a big, fat rod. Most any skinny rod will 
do.  You will need six inches, though.  (Gotta stop now, 'cause I will be 
blamed for getting off topic)
