&gt; I thought I had the infamous VW Bus door lock problem but after  searching the archives, I'm not so sure.  All of the problems I  found in the archives were with trying to unlock the door with a  key.  Mine is with squeezing the latch open.

&gt;   Quite a while back I had this problem.  The door latch would be  very hard to squeeze open.  I could insert the key, lock and then  unlock and it opened fine.  I sprayed it good with PB  Blaster.  I've come to think of that stuff as a cure-all but have  since learned spraying anything into the locks is a no-no.   Anyhow, I don't know what fixed it but it quit doing that for well over  a year.
&gt;
&gt;   Now the problem is back.  Same symptoms, driver's door only.   Real PITA.  Anybody else had this problem?   Thanks....KR

Sorry, but the only way I know to check this is to take things apart and
look.  It sounds to me like you might have the classic broken spring.
Lube does tend to help things, but it doesn't fix the underlying problem.
