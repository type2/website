Subject: Re: [T2] Friday kind of post

I really can't find this answer in the archive which somehow authaurize 
myself to post my question to the list.
 From which sit,  the driver is supposed to drive , left  or  right side 
? , I rules out the back sit since it won't be practical to watch the 
road and I would be very tempted to make coffee while driving. Ho ! I 
almost forget ! I have a California vanagon 83 model.

Thanks for any help

Well its friday !! sorry ;-) 
Chris

Vanagon 83
