Subject: Parts needed

Anyone here from Canada?

I'm looking for some door pins for my 78' van. I need 2 or 3 so I can 
install an alarm into it.
I just can't seem to find anything locally.

Found some retractable seatbelts from a Volvo that will install easy.

(OT) What's funny is I installed a sub and amp into it and it's so much 
fuller sounding than
it sounded in my little car... amazing how space makes everything so much 
better.

I took my friend for a ride and he couldn't stop looking nervous as well as 
his singing
Jefferson Airplane's 'white rabbit' song.  Talk about a weird feeling lol.

I wouldn't mind meeting some local's who are into their Vw's.

J
