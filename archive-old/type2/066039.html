Subject: Adding seat belts.

After buying my '72 Westy, I decided that I should look into providing
seat belts in the back for the kids. The first problem was one of 
anchorage. 

        Fixing the two bottom points wasn't much of a problem.
I made up some 4&quot; plates, drilled and nuts welded on the back were
welded in. The third point (above the shoulder) was a problem,
the ideal fixing point was halfway up the window! However I had noticed
that Volvo had overcome a similar problem in their estate car. A steel
rod
with a seatbelt loop, spanned the window, fixed above and below into the
bodywork. So I had some plates welded in the appropriate places and
fixed 
two rods pulled from a scrap Volvo. (Taking care to find one which had
died of old age rather than some other more traumatic event!) Once
fitted,
it was just a case of getting some seatbelts which would be long enough
to go all the way around the installation. 

        OK OK I will admit I got my belts from a scrapped BMW. Not the best
solution, but a whole lot better than none at all! 

This may be of interest.

Regards Simon.
