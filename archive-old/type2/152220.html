&gt; &gt;&gt; Now to find the missing pieces... I'll let everyone know what is missing and
&gt; &gt;&gt; hopefully someone will have the parts. If anyone is interested in the
&gt; &gt; if you can find a junkyard/pick n pull 411/412
&gt;
&gt; The 71 bus used a BN4, not a BA4, so if the heater is from a stock 71 Bus

that's correct. the BA4 if from a &quot;real&quot; type IV

&gt; application, it is the former. I would recommend a BN4 in a bus over a BA4,
&gt; just because it a standard application and all the factory documentation is
&gt; there to support it, not to mention the &quot;kludginess&quot; of putting a BA4 in a
&gt; vehicle it was not designed for. The BN4 is a great deal simpler to boot.

again very true but BN4 are a little hard to come by the BA4 is more
plentiful

&gt; Germansupply has a very good stock of new and used gas heater parts such as
&gt; control switches, glow plugs, fuel pumps, flame switches, safety relays etc.

unfortunately everything for these heaters is $$$$$$$
