Subject: Portland, Oregon Mechanics - Update

I sent a post in a few days ago regarding me changing my mechanic.  I ended 
up going to Always VW and was pretty happy with the results.  I took it in 
for them to do some minor adjustments(carb adj, new points and timing).  
They did it for 20 bucks and also checked out some stuff I hadn't asked them 
to.  Which is nice to know they are just not rushing it in and out.  They 
found that I had a vacuum leak on the carb manifold, and that the 
distributor was for a type 3???  I haven't picked it up yet so I dont' have 
specifics.

But can anyone tell me what kind of Distributor was stock with the 71 bus.  
Its a late 70 model.  And what kind of Carb are most of you running.  My bus 
has a 33/34 pict.  I'm thinking I need a 30 pict??
the bus is a 1600 Dual Port.

Please post privately.

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
