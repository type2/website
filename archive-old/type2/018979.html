Well, thats ok if you are a resto person, but I bought some seriously cool
handles from a local cut-price stationery shop the other day :-) They are
fridge magnets in the shape of little hands giving the 'veedub' sign. Made  of
perspex, the colour is bright 'gorilla-snot' green. They have inspired me to
totally redecorate 'Ektor's interior.... so their value at 40p each is now
somewhat dubious :-(
