&gt; The heads must be taken off in order to get the old tubes out and put the new
&gt; ones in. As far as sealant, all I used and was recommended to use, was the new
&gt; gaskets that come in your basic engine gasket kit. Of course I'm working on a
&gt; '65 not a '80 but the heads should still need to come off. Otherwise how are you
&gt; going to get the push rod tubes out from around the push rods? Happy wrenching!

Correct me if i'm wrong, but i thought that one could slide out the pushrod tubes
just by removing the valvecovers, rockers, and push rods on a T4.(???)
