Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Heat

I'll jump in here as a physics teacher type and add a BIG safety caution!

&gt; I've had a couple of requests for instructions to make the coffee can
&gt; furnace. I won one of these as a door prize at Busses Nowhere Near The Arch
&gt; a couple of years ago. It's an ingenious little device.
&gt;
&gt; Get a 1 pound steel coffee can (empty of course). Save the little plastic
&gt; re-sealable lid. Get a roll of cheap toilet paper. Use a pair of needle nose
&gt; pliers to pull the cardboard core out of the center of the roll of paper.
&gt; Crush the roll of TP down to close up the hole where the core used to be.
&gt; You may have to remove some of the paper to make it fit in the can. It
&gt; should be snug, but not overly tight.
&gt;
&gt; Press the paper to the bottom of the can. Should be about 1/2 to 3/4 inch of
&gt; space above the paper to the lip of the can. Get a bottle of rubbing alcohol
&gt; from the pharmacy. The kind you rub on cuts and scrapes. If you get the
&gt; wintergreen kind it will make your bus smell good.

I'm rather surprised that ordinary rubbing alcohol will burn well enough.
Rubbing alcohol is only 70% alcohol (30% water) and is hard to light.  You
can get 90% alcohol.

&gt; Slowly pour the alcohol into the coffee can. The TP will soak it up. Bubbles
&gt; will rise to the surface as the alcohol is soaking into the paper. At some
&gt; point the bubbles will stop and the furnace will be full. Pour off any
&gt; excess liquid. It should hold most of a bottle. The paper acts as a wick,
&gt; bringing the alcohol to the surface. Just hold a match over the top of the
&gt; paper to light. You will get a small blue flame. Maybe about 6 inches in
&gt; height. Alcohol burns clean... no fumes.

Relatively clean.  It is a hydrocarbon, so any incomplete combustion will
result in HC and CO emissions.

&gt; You only have two worries. Leave an
&gt; window open a crack so you don't burn up all the oxygen and don't set the
&gt; curtains on fire. I set mine on top of the ice box well away from the
&gt; curtains. You might have to light two of them if you're camping below
&gt; freezing, otherwise one should work just fine. The flame will put off light,
&gt; heat and moisture. No fumes.

Other worries.  Tip the thing over and you're likely to have a puddle of
burning alcohol in your bus.  Don't count on the toilet paper to contain
all the alcohol

An alcohol flame is not very visible.  If you use ethanol the flame is
almost invisible, particularly in light.  It will still burn you.

&gt; To put out the flame, all you need do is cut off the oxygen supply for a
&gt; second or so. I use a book or a magazine slapped down over the top of the
&gt; can just for an instant. I've never set anything on fire. After the can
&gt; cools a bit snap the plastic lid back on to keep the alcohol from
&gt; evaporating. Should burn several hours on one charge. I can usually get the
&gt; alcohol at the drugstore for about 50 cents a bottle sometimes on sale 2 for
&gt; 50 cents.
&gt;
&gt; If you start to notice the paper starting to turn black and smoking, you're
&gt; running out of alcohol. Just put it out and add another bottle.

And be _darned_ sure that it is out and cold!  In a nearby school, two
students were adding alcohol to a tennis-ball cannon.  A residual flame
caught the fumes on fire, causing the bottle to explode in the student's
hand.  Two students spent over a month in the burn ward.

&gt; I do recommend you have a fire extinguisher handy and don't do this if
&gt; you've ever smelled gas fumes inside of your bus. Make sure all of your fuel
&gt; lines are quite secure (always a good idea!).

Personally, I wouldn't have any open flames inside a vehicle.  This device
is similar to the &quot;Desert candles&quot; we have used outdoor for years, but it
is just too dangerous to be inside.
