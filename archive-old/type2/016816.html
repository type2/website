To Ken and others,

I drive a bus, not out of some karma enticed want, or nostalgia. Its not
even for its odd styling.  I got the one I have out of neccessity.  I
needed cheap transportation that I understood how to repair.  Having had
a bug during High School and College,  a bus was an easy choice to
make.  The one I ended up with was a '69 Westy with rust so bad that
there was more duct tape than steel in the floorboards.  One day, I saw
a post on the list for a 69 sunroof shell,  free to a good home, all you
had to do was pick it up and it was in north central Oklahoma.  Living
in Wichita, KS and driving a rust bucket,  a free shell that was rust
free and virtually dent free was appealing.  I wrote Josh and found out
where he lived, and how stripped the shell was.  &quot;Totally  stripped&quot; he
said, not even windows or doors were left.  I rented a uhaul  tow dolly
and drove my Mitsubishi Montero down to Ponca City to pick it up.  Once
there I got cold feet about dragging the rear end of this thing all the
way back to Wichita.  Josh said: &quot; Hey, no problem,  I'll just borrow my
dad - in - law's flat bed trailer and haul it up to you tomorrow, pay my
gas up and back and buy me a case of beer and we'll call it even.&quot;  The
next day, Josh arrived as promised with bus in tow on  a trailer.
Seldom will friends take the time to travel 180 miles out of their way,
let alone someone you've just met.  Josh wrote me on occasion to see how
the bus was coming.  He looked at the bus that I had and the bus he was
giving me and figured it would be a winter project.  It was summer,  I
am a teacher , and two weeks later, I was driving a bus that I had
nearly totally built.  In the few moments that I knew Josh, I discovered
a man of boundless energy and a desire to see others succeed as well as
himself.  Whatever darkness that crouched in the corner of his soul, and
caused him to leave this life a little early,  I will probably never
know, but his generosity, his joy in life,  and his red, white, and blue
bus,  I will never forget.
