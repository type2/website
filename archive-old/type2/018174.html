         The thing about insurance companies to remember is that you
don't have to take their offer -- go get a estimate from a couple of
body shops, and demand the full amount. Tell them that it's not just a
car, it's a antique, and that you are going to sue them if you don't get
the full amount, and that then they will have to pay you not only the
full amount but also the full amount of your lawyer's bill (and the
court will tack that on) and that could easily be double or triple the
repair bill.
        You can also file a complaint with your state insurance
commissioner -- insurance companies are terrified of the insurance
commissioner, he can lift their license. I used to work for a dental
office -- the insurance companies *ALWAYS* dragged their feet -- two,
three, four months to pay the bill. After we starting complaining, they
paid within days. And never messed with us again.
