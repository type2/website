Mark and others,
I sent a reply to this thread earlier but forgot to include the list on it
:-)

Only the CA model Buses had lambda/oxygen sensors.  '79-'83 federal model
Buses have catalytic converters but no oxygen sensor.

You can use a cat on a carbureted vehicle if you want, it was certainly done
in '75 when catalytic converters became mandatory in the US.  The cat might
not last as long in a carb system or a system without lambda control but
it'll still do its job.

&gt; &lt;&lt; I believe to use a cat on your bus it would be necessary to obtain and
fit
&gt; a
&gt;  late FI system which includes a lambda sensor. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; My bus is a 79 &quot;federal emissions&quot; model with a catalytic converter.  It
did
&gt; not have an oxygen sensor when I got it.  Was it just &quot;CA emissions&quot;
versions
&gt; that did, or did my bus also have one originally?
