&gt; Hello list and all auto tranny lovers.  Can the transmission be pulled by
&gt; itself without motor?

no, not enough fore and aft room

&gt;  Or is it easier to pull as a complete unit with
&gt; motor?  Thanks, Mark

I take the motor out seperately, then the tranny.

unlike the manual the auto does not have a long power shaft to clear and
can drop almost straight down.   also the auto tranny is MUCH heavier than
the manual tranny.

why do you need to pull the tranny anyway??
