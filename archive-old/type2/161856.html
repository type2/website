&gt;&gt; I found these at Discount Tire when I replaced the ones on my
&gt;&gt; 63' Double Cab.  Just a thought.  Proper load range and specs
&gt;&gt; and the ride is nice as well.  Or atleast, as well as it
&gt;&gt; could be for a DC.

&gt; We carry this in 205-65R15, which is the same height as the 14&quot; tires found
&gt; on later Busses.  It is an excellent tire. We also sell the 14&quot; Vredestein
&gt; snows when we can get them. However Vredestein does not sell a 14&quot; summer
&gt; tire here in the U.S.  Even if they did, it would cost considerably more
&gt; than the 185R14 Hankook RA08, our 14&quot; all-season offering, which IMO is
&gt; definitely the best 14&quot; year-round Bus tire available for anywhere near its
&gt; price...

For anyone in eastern Canada, we have an excellent tire, the Signet SV-820,
it is pound for pound on par with the Michelin Agillis at about half the
price. A really excellent bus tire in every way.

We don't ship these at the moment, they are for pick up only.
