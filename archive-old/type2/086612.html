Subject: Re: [T2] Suspension query


Just looking at the pictures I can't tell you the condition of those parts.
There is some rust there but it doesn't look like cancer. You have to check
each part for play. Tie-rods can be rusty as hell and still not have any
noticable play. Ball joints same story. Steering dampner may be fine too
unless it looks like its leaked fluid. Best bet is to put your bus on a
lift or jack stands and inspect each component per Bentley for wear .
Wiggle the tires and have your helper look for play in the ball joints, tie
rods, and steering parts.
     The alternative here is to just buy all new parts and install them,
have your bus aligned and be happy knowing everything is new... Not to
economical in my view though.

My bus still has the original shocks on it, and they've clapped out.
Checking out the front suspension I see everything there has aged.

I'd appreciate it if someone could look at the suspension pictures at the
bottom of this URL and tell me what they think of the condition of these
items; I'd like to replace them at the same time.
