Subject: Re: [T2] Depressing afternoon working on the bus...

I've never had to pull my wiper motor...I'm not hoping to either. It sounds 
like some preventive maintenance would be in order. Can someone give a 
procedure for lubing important points preferably while the motor is still in 
place? Like for example spraying white grease spray up from below or into 
the shafts from outside? Or is it only a remove and dissassemble deal?

&gt; I found it was easier to pull the entire dash out a foot or so than to
&gt; try to get the _at_^%&amp;_at_#~! thing out from underneath.

&lt;Everyone learns that the hard way.

&gt; Rained on me the whole time I was working on this.

Are you saying that's ironic?

&gt; When I had checked out the switch a couple weeks ago, the thing was
&gt; shorted all across the contacts. That tells me that the switch burned
&gt; out the motor which now draws an outrageous amount of current to not
&gt; move anything.

That's what motors do when they can't move. My electricity theory is rusty
but iirc the back emf keeps the motor from accelerating and drawing excess
amounts of current.
