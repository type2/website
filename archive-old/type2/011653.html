&gt;sure how they work specifically, 

The oil cooler shouldn't be too dirty, especially not
oily crud, as dirt acts as insulation (preventing heat
from the oil from transfering to the air going through
the oil cooler), and dirt also restricts the flow of
cooling air through the oil cooler, also adversely
affecting the cooling of the oil. Lots of oily dirt
could be an indication of oil leakage.   And, of
course, you can't tell what the insides of the oil
cooler are like just by looking at the outside of it.
So, it is entirely possible that the oil cooler isn't
working at peak efficiency.  Did you clean it off good
on the outside before reinstalling it?  You should
also straighten any bent fins so that air can travel
through it properly.  There are many who feel that the
oil cooler should be replaced, not reused, when an
engine is rebuilt, which I would also recommend.  Any
doubts as to the condition of the oil cooler, and it
should probably be replaced, even if you aren't doing
a total rebuild. ( I think that the difficulty of
really properly cleaning the innards of an oil cooler
has been discussed on the list, maybe I read about it
in a search of the archives on oil coolers, etc.)
Good luck.
