&gt; Where is a good place to buy parts for an Automatic Transmission out of a
&gt; 1973 Westy? I have the transmission torn down and need to completely rebuild
&gt; it. I am not having much luck finding parts. Any thoughts?

that is the 003 tranny, I would try to find a later 010 tranny it is a
fairly easy switch.
