Subject: RE: [T2] Duncan's new bus (oops/power loss update) AND returnof
  the oil F.A.R.T.

Hmm...it might be that I stick to 20w50 all year then. It very rarely gets
over 30C over here during the summer, most days are between -10 and 30 so it
should be fine :) Average temperature has to be around the 17C mark. Sounds
like I'm on the oil change every 2,000 miles then - anything to reduce
potential pain ;)

I used to be a believer in the straight-weight HD-30 BUT I had problems
with low oil pressure this summer (new rebuild, tight tolerances).
granted, I was running at interstate speeds on the hottest days of the
year (100-105 deg F / 38-40 deg C).  IMHO 20w50 is better all around.
lower viscosity when cold, higher viscosity when hot.  conventional
wisdom says that polymers they add to make it multi-weight is
susceptible to breakdown over time, other folks say that modern oils are
more durable--regardless I change my oil often particularly under such
extreme conditions.
