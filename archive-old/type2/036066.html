Mark writ:

&gt;So why are y'all carrying them around by hand? Bone-headed machismo?

Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. Couple of years ago, I moved a T4 
engine, complete except for the one heater box that I could get off, from 
the icy ground in Milwaukee, into the trunk of a 72 Nova. Did cheat and walk 
it up a pair of planks, but if I'd taken time to round up a gentlemans' tool 
of some sort to do it with..that freakin blizzard would have killed me.
