Subject: New engine, '71 Westy, growling sound! - follow up
Message-ID: &lt;19991022141739.29708.rocketmail_at_web1003.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

I forgot to say that this growling problem didn't
exist until I started fooling around with the clutch
cable. 
I &quot;adjusted&quot; the clutch cable immediately after
installing the new engine. I did the cam/lifter
breakin by running the engine at 2000 rpms for 20
minutes. Then without having driven the bus I had it
towed to a repair shop to have some work done that I
didn't have the tools to do. When I picked it up it
seemed as if the clutch cable was adjusted differently
than I had adjusted it. So I tightened the wingnut to
take some play out of the cable. When I drove it for
the first time after that I noticed the growling for
the first time. I've tried to adjust the cable several
times since this started and no matter what I do I
still hear the growling sound. I'm told you can't hear
it when you are outside the vehicle. 

I'll appreciate any help you can give me.
Thanks,
