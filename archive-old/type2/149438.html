Subject: Re: [T2] R &amp; R Exhaust Studs - Northern Virginia

&gt;Didn't see these at the sears site, but they are here and look like this.

These are not metric.   I bought a set of 4 metric stud pullers, a decent 
product and a decent price.  JBB

&quot;&quot;Your wrench is right Barry.
Don't heat the stud, heat the area around it.&quot;&quot;

Ok, but the area around it is Aluminum and I imagine that the Aluminum will 
quickly spread the heat and take a LONG time to get up in temperature.  JBB

&quot;&quot;Get yourself a decent stud puller that will fit on the end of your 3/8's
drive ratchet, and they will back right out.&quot;&quot;

My auto mechanic was using a 8mm stud puller, and together we got just one 
out.  No heat, just careful powered arm movement.  it was so difficult, he 
said that he would do just one a day, 'cause the other two we tried just 
slipped around the stud puller.  This guy likes to go by the nickname 
&quot;MacGyver&quot;.  I still want a machine shop...  EVWParts in Severna Park 
Maryland advertises to R&amp;R an exhaust stud at $15 the first, and $12 each 
additional.  Around $100 per pair of heads.  But that probably includes the 
studs.  EVWParts is about 70 miles away from me, and about $25 in gas!!  JBB


&quot;&quot;The GE hydraulic lifter engines used spring # 021 109 623 K

Both parts are not in stock at any dealer in the Cobalt Group. You would 
need to
check with your local dealer to see if they are still available.
Bus Depot shows those 2 part numbers and the year differences,&quot;&quot;

Karl, I called my local FLAPS.  They said they have access to 17 of these 
springs. Just now I ordered 8 _at_ $5.50 each, a bit more that Bus Depot, but 
when I tried to order from bus Depot some 3 years ago, Bus Depot said the 
price was DOUBLE what they listed.  So back three years ago I called this 
locals FLAPS and I was able to get them ar the reduced price because their 
system did not catch up yet.  Now the price is representative of 
availability.

The FLAPS said they have not heard  of the Cobalt Group.   I'm on the East 
Coast   JBB
