  To Al Brase: Re Knipex pliers:
I'm confused- these are &quot;channelock like&quot;- but your dealer stood on them-
they lock like Vice-Grips?  How wide is the jaw?
   The problem isn't the jaw shape but the width of the plier...to prevent
kinking you want to spread the force over a wide area  while also
pulling/twisting back.  The strap idea is OK with vice grips (but I tapped
the vice-grip backwards with a hammer and used rubberized webbing- just
smear GOOP over the webbing where it grips the tube).  Cleaning the oil
film off the tube helps also.
   I have this idea of making a remover by using  a piece of thin wall
steel pipe 2&quot; long with an inner diameter = to the pushrod tube or slightly
bigger.   Cut one side lengthwise (sawzall or hacksaw).  Shim the gap made
by the cut and grip it lightly with a vicegrip so the cut faces the jaw
fulcrum.   Weld/epoxy this in place.  Now cut the other side. Smooth out
the edges, and coat it with goop or silicone rubber.  Since I'll likely
foreget this idea by the time I need seals, someone let me know how it works!
