Subject: Who Designed These Windows?

Hiya List,

To get the rear window channel (that little &amp;*%#_at_!#) back in place I had to 
remove my driver's side door window glass.  I managed to do that without 
removing the winder mechanism.  But it looks as if I'll have to remove the 
winder mechanism in order to get the glass back in.  The problem is that the 
winder does not want to come out.  Is there some kinda trick to getting it 
out?  

I followed Bentley up to step 8 on page 14 of Body &amp; Frame.  Step 8 reads, 
&quot;Press the window front guide (huh?) channels off its bracket.  Then, through 
the gap thus formed, pull the window lifter assembly downward and out of the 
door.&quot;  What the heck are they talking about?

HEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLP!
