Subject: Re: [T2] Small cracks in heads

I might get flamed for saying this but if your bus has a type 4 engine 
(didn't say in your post if it was type1 or type4) some small cracks in 
the exhaust ports are common and may not be harmful.  It depends upon 
the location and severity of the crack.

The late Mark Stephens High Performance sold rebuilt type4 heads with 
cracks in the exhaust ports and claimed they were just fine.  And I have 
seen people run with them for many miles with no problems.

That said, if the crack extends to the valve seat, it is probably one of 
those times where you should not reinstall the head since type4 heads 
are notorious for dropping valve seats, and it causes a lot of damage 
when it happens.

&gt; Here's my bigger question: after inspecting the heads, we noticed some small 
&gt; cracks in and around the exhaust ports near the valve stem seats on both 
&gt; heads. They look to me like casting cracks, so I was wondering how common it 
&gt; is to find small cracks in the heads and will this be a problem, or do I need 
&gt; to replace them? Thanks.
