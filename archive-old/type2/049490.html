Subject: Re: [T2] 1929cc will it work?

[...]

&gt; Hey all,
&gt;   As some of you know I am working on a Cali converted type 4 engine for
my 71
&gt; Westy. The parts I have available to work with are what I want to use. I
have a
&gt; 2.0L Vanagon engine with a good crank and rods, but even though the case
is
&gt; perfect I can not use it due to the beather casting. It has bad pistons
and
&gt; cylinders and bad heads. I also have a good 1.8L. The heads are good and
so are
&gt; the P&amp;C's. I will be useing the case form this motor(or one of my 1.7Ls)
for
&gt; the build up. I would like to use the 2.0L crank and rods with the 93mm
Ps&amp;c's
&gt; from the 1.8L to make a 1929cc. Is this possible? I figure I will have to
lower
&gt; the compression ratio, but to what? This will be for a Westy so I need the
&gt; torque of the longer crank. Any sugestions?

The length of the rods are different between a 1.7/1.8 and 2.0.
2.0 are longer.  I believe the piston measurement from the top edge of the
piston the center of the wrist pin on a 2.0 is shorter than a 1.7/1.8
piston. Measure this distance on both pistons. I think the head of the 1.8
piston will stick out of the cylinder _at_ TDC......
