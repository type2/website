Subject: Re: [T2] Idiot lights and other assorted questions

The problem with diagnosing your rough idle (and the oil light for that
matter) is once the engine leaves the stock configuration, there are way too
many variables. Maybe that engine is going to idle rough no matter what
because of a really lumpy cam? Maybe the wiring was hacked to include some
non-stock FI components?

That said, the first thing to check for is your fuel pressure in the morning
before starting it and then when warm and idling. When you get home at
night, shut it off and attach a fuel pressure gauge to the bung on the fuel
rail. (I believe the Bentley has this procedure? Can someone confirm? My
Bentley's in the Guac and I don't wanna go back outside. Too lazy.) Start it
up again and let it idle for a few minutes (it's still warm right?) and
check the reading. Leave the gauge attached and shut the bus off. The
pressure should stay pretty close to the idle pressure. In the morning take
a peek at it again and see how much it's dropped. Start it up again and make
sure the pressure comes right back up.

If the pressure dropped immediately after shutting off or was completely
flat in the morning you've got a leak either in the fuel lines or a sticky
injector. If the pressure doesn't come right back up you probably have fuel
pump issues. Leaky injectors especially can cause roughness when cold. As
for the id10t light, you may have a sticky pressure switch. Pick one up
(they're only a couple dollars) and swap it in when you get a chance and see
if it makes a difference.
