Subject: Re: [T2] successful sliding door fix

It always feels good to complete a repair, but you didn't mention anything
about lubing the door hardware.  To keep your door working well, you need
to put some stick lube on the sliding track up under the cover, some oil on
the hinge, oil on both latches and oil the rollers both top and bottom.  I
even put oil on the bottome where the wheels roll to keep that area from
rusting.


&gt;The &quot;link&quot; on my sliding door was cracked making the
&gt;door a bear to operate. I got a used one last week and
&gt;put it in Sat a.m. Incredibly satisfying repair job!
&gt;Didn't shriek and curse once. Door works so well, I
&gt;made my kids watch as I demonstrated about 10 times.
