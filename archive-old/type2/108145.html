Subject: Westy Utility Cover Flap

I'm looking at a Westy utility cover flap (thank you, Jon).  It would help a
lot if I could see exactly how the cover fits onto the utility receptacle
housing.  Is there an on-line source for Westy part diagrams?

I'd like to look into both strengthening the flap and adding some sort of
aerodynamic feature to it in order to lessen the wind stress on the flap
during driving.  In order to do this I need to see how it closes onto the
housing (for clearances, etc.).

Thanks for the help.
