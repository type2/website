&gt;I have yet to install a Wolfsburg West panel that fit.
I am one of their wholesale dealers, I love the rubber and carpet etc. but
the metal
big frown.

Josh says they are good, I disagree, what pcs have you installed Josh?

Sheet metal artists,

        Though I feel my experience with  VW sheet metal is quite limited,
I have been thoroughly impressed with the product that Wolfsburg West has
provided me with.  Maybe if I had gone with the more superior supplier, Das
Bulli Haus, first, my opinion may be different.  

        I have experience with the following sheet metal offered from WW
for pre-'68 buses:
2 inner rockers
2 outer rockers
1 lower 8 inch rocker
2 outer 10 inch cargo floors
2 outriggers
1 front cross brace
1 rear cross brace

        The only experience I have with DBH was a battery tray that I
ordered at a significantly higher price (of course...you pay for what you
get, right?).  It was much heavier thickness of metal and it fit like a
glove.

        Agreed, DBH is a superior sheetmetal supplier....but most of the
stuff I have replaced did not require their level of quality per dollar. 
Dont get me wrong, now, I am mostly a perfectionist (ask my friends...they
call me &quot;anal&quot; when it comes to bus stuff) but I am also realistic.  I have
been completely satisfied with the fit of every WW sheet metal part I have
ever recieved.

         Maybe when I run into some really intensively difficult
replacements, like...say dog legs, I will change my views but for now for
things like inner rockers and outriggers I will continue to use WW.
