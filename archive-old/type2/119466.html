&gt;Without disparaging the proper tool at all I have used a coin clamped in a

I knew someone had a homemade solution. The porsche tool has a different profile than the Sears one.

&gt;I believe (from very old memory) that the gasket on the pressure relief
&gt;valve plug is a crush ring not an O-ring.  See part &quot;U&quot; at your page

I goofed in the reply. It's a crush washer as listed on my webpage.
