Subject: Re: engine hatch open - just say no

and this air is coming up
&gt; from UNDER the bus as well. HEATED
&gt; air from up under the bus. Air your fan just got finished dumping OUT.

I read a post recently in which an individual had a weber progressive on his bus with a bad engine compartment seal.  He had never had any trouble with the legendary icing or fuel condensation problems UNTIL he replaced the comp. seal - then he started to suffer.  When he sealed his compartment, he STOPPED drawing warm air into the compartment, which had been heating the compartment aparently enough to help with the carb problem. I don't know if he was overheating - didn't sound like it in the post (hey man, if you're out there speak up! :-&gt;). Now, what i'm going to do, because i will be running the weber carb on my 75 1800 --i'm not saying anyone else should do this-- is take my extra compartment door, install a small vent towards the bottom side of it, and when winter comes i will switch my engine hatches out. Cuss or discuss?
