did anyone from the list ever go on that trip to the southern most part of
chilie.  I remember that was a thing going on for awhile and everyone from
the list was gonna get together.  I was bummed out I couldn't make it but
never heard anything.

did that get trashed or what??


I was on that list for awhile. Was (is?) to leave this Sept, so as to be in
Tierra del Fuego on the real new millineum. Believe you can call up the web
by searching for  55 South. There was a problem associated with crossing the
Darien straits..and the price got quickly out of my range (like air-lifting
busses across!!)

Good luck..hope you can afford to go, and give us some vicarious thrills :)

Marv Krupp..lucky to make it downhill from the mountains to Fla.
