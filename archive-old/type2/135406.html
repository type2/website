Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Single Port Heads

Ya, I got a pair of new SP heads when they were $125  (the DP were  $105 ) 
because I was happy they were available new suddenly.  Haven't had  to price the 
stuff recently, but check a bunch of places... prices do  vary.

Tom,

They are still widely available at extreme varying  prices.

At least it appears that way based on several vendors online  catalogs.

Rebuilt from $89.95 to new at $269.....

When it gets  really bad, I'll dig out my cache of old engines/heads and 
start selling  them off.  Sure am glad I didn't start throwing them away.

Cheers,  dave

I know that they are no longer  being made, but does anyone have a line 
on rebuilt or new SP heads?   
&gt; 
&gt; Or know of a reputable rebuilder in the  Baltimore/Washington/Philly area?
&gt; 
&gt; I just determined that my  &quot;good&quot; heads need quite a bit more work than I'm 
&gt; ready for at the  moment (and one of them might be cracked) and I'm looking 
&gt; at my  options.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
