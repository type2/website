Subject: Exhaust leak?

Hi again people!
Thanks for the suggestions and info on my engine trouble. One of you 
suggested an exhaust leak and I looked into that a little and remembered 
that my engine has also recently started backfiring alot when I shift and 
let off the accelerator. If that's the problem can anybody key me in on how 
to check on this? Thanks again.
