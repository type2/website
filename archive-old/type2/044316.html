Subject: [T2] '71 Bus For Sale

For those who may be interested, there is a '71 Deluxe Bus for sale in
the SF Bay Area.

According to the seller:


&gt; '71 Deluxe Bus, medium green/white top. Straight and in good running order. Engine strong, transmission solid. Asking price
&gt; $1500.
&gt;
&gt; The negatives: front (nose) has been replaced with one from a later model. Although the work is very good, the result is late
&gt; model turn signals on an early bay window bus. Brakes don't hold as well as they could; likely glazed shoes and/or drums need
&gt; turning.
&gt;
I looked briefly at the bus. First impression is that it is a straight
vehicle. The rear bottom corners looked OK. There was duct tape across
the top of the windshield indicating the usual leakage. The nose job
wasn't obvious until I was told; it's a good job. Assuming that the
drive train works as advertised (the seller seemed very confident with
the engine/transmission), it may be a bus worth considering for
somebody. A further advantage for CA drivers is that '71 doesn't have to
be smogged! :^)

Interested parties can contact Gary at (925) 229-2877.

I have no financial interest in this. Really.
