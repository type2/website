Subject: [T2] oil pressure sensor wire M.I.A. 75 westy

Hi listies,

In a 75 westy chasis can anyone help me to narrow things down in my search 
for which of the several unconnected wires( in my engine compartment) goes 
to the oil pressure sensor.Color/which harness from/which side of engine 
compartment it runs toward etc. Maybe if one of you has a 75 westy you 
could check yours and give me a visual.
Also I'd lile to install an oil pressure guage but can't seem to get a 
wrench onto the oil pressure sensor to remove it.Any ideas.

Thanks again for all the help. I'm planning to drive from Wyoming to 
Seatle starting next week. Then meandering my way slowly down the coast 
eventually to San Diego with some planned and unplanned stops along the 
way.
Wish me luck

Mickey
