Hi,

&gt; I'm curious about your opinions about dual carbs.  The stock dual solex's
I
&gt; have are working fine, but I've been jostled by odd whisperings and faint
&gt; rumors of the joys of new progressive carbs.  Thoughts, feelings, dirty
&gt; anecdotes?

 I'd stay stock.  My impression is that aftermarket carbs are a lot of
hassle to get working properly and may not provide a net gain (ie you 
may get better breathing at the cost of poor cold weather performance
or hesitation at low revs). If your stock carbs were trashed and you
couldn't find or afford replacements then maybe it would be worth
substituting.
 The rest of the world used carbs on pancakes right up to 1980. I think
many of the progressive conversions in the US have been done because
people didn't like the Fuel Injection system on the later busses
rather than because of any inherant superiority: IIRC the stock
Solexes are (were?) very expensive, and so not popular for the
retrofitting brigade.

Cheers,
	 W. ('77 Devon conversion w/ 2.0l and (stock) dual Solexes).
