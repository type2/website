Subject: Re: pump, tank, what's wrong?  -  cleaning tank

The easy answer is remove the tank and give it a good clean (rinse out).
As this requires a motor pull, it is a major pain. (it is just possible to
remove the tank with a type 4 motor without removing the motor though)
The PO of my bus cut a hole in the floor to replace the fuel gauge sender.
Removing the cover panel above the sender, and removing the sender gives
just enough access to the tank to remove any foreign objects. A major bonus
when your on the side of the road on a long trip!!
Cheers,
