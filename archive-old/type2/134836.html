Subject: Re: [T2] WR1

&gt;I installed a WR1 kit today.
&gt; But, it doesn't seem to help.

Throw that thing in the trash and buy a new starter.

They add insult to injury. Seriously look at your starter and how it is 
wired and ask yourself what a soliniod is and why you would need another 
one. When ever I see these things I *&amp;%#$ rip them out.

&gt;I need to get underneath and try to manually kick the starter over.

I knew a guy that killed himself doing that. Seriously
