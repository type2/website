&gt; &gt; 	Just out of curiosity George, why do you believe that a powerful auto
&gt; &gt; stereo would have to be 'annoying'?
&gt; 
&gt; Because if played at the intended volume in an urban setting it subjects
&gt; everyone within 50 yards of the vehicle to the musical tastes of the
&gt; stereo owner.
&gt; 
&gt;   I have personally installed dozens of
&gt; &gt; automotive audio systems, and I have never designed one that I would
&gt; &gt; describe as 'annoying' to listen to, let alone &quot;very_annoying&quot;.

stop by my place on a Fri or Sat night the locals have decided the road in
front of my house is the place to cruise and see who's radio/cd is the
loudest....danged if I could tell you what any of the songs are though.

me I prefer the sound of my engine and my own thoughts, a wire on my radio
broke oh 5-6 years ago and I still haven't bothered to fix it, still
haven't put the antenna back on either.

&gt; Wattage is power, the product of voltage and amperage.  The relationship
&gt; between the power and current is porportional at constant voltage.  It
&gt; doesn't matter which term is discussed.
&gt; 
&gt; 30A??  I think that this is a bit high.  Perhaps the inital surge, but
&gt; once the field is established the current should drop.  There are a lot of
&gt; cars out there with A/C, quad headlamps (220W total) and 55A alternators
&gt; and I don't see them flattening their batteries.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; My statement that a larger alternator would be a good idea, especially if
&gt; &gt; you are adding  multiple loading devices to the charging system, seems (to
&gt; &gt; me)to be 'sound' advice.  Oh, the statement that a 75 amp alternator doesn't

well I would like to up to a 75 amp alternator, I ski in the winter and at
night in bad weather my BA-4, windshield wipers, headlights, and heated
wiper blades will flatten my batteries (twin 125ah) in a couple hours,
usually have to turn the heater off for 15minutes of every hour to keep
from running dry.   I usually carry a charger for when parked at night, I
run an extension out and run the charger and block dipstick heater to make
starting in those sub 0F mornings just a little easier.
