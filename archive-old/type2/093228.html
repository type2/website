&gt;Also I'm wondering if you can get the sodium filled valves in larger

I wouldn't bother with the sodium valves.  They are expensive, hard to find 
and the jury is out on whether or not they are actually a benefit.  Some 
people have said that the stems are prone to breaking.  Manley SS valves 
are fine.  The Porsche 914 heads have sodium valves but they have larger 
diameter stems and thus are more reliable.  These heads are pricey and rare 
but will make good power.  They also require 3-bolt intakes instead of the 
4-bolt bus ones.

&gt;This is one I've been having problems with also, I'd really like to stroke 
&gt;it a bit, but not sure how it's going to impact the health of the 
&gt;engine.  I also havn't found any places that carry stroker kits for the 
&gt;type4.  I'd like some advice on where to buy my crank/pistons either 
&gt;2000cc or bigger from and what I should get.  Gex has some that I was 
&gt;eyeing, but scares me of course now =p.

As it should.  Jake Raby has stroker engines but he doesn't sell the parts 
separately.  You might consider just buying one of his engines.  He has a 
good rep but of course it won't be cheap.  And you won't get hydraulic 
lifters (he doesn't believe in them).  If you find a source for 
counterweighted 2L cranks, please let me know - I want one.

&gt;I'm going to go hydraulic conversion and just wanted to make sure what I 
&gt;needed to get.  From what I've gathers a hydraulic lifter/cam kit with 
&gt;matching (shorter) pushrods is what I'd need.  I'm assuming the valve 
&gt;train is the same.  Also need recommondations on this.

Talk to WebCam (www.webcaminc_dot_net).  I'm probably going to go with the 107i 
grind.

&gt;Total Seal Rings...
&gt;
&gt;I used these on my truck and would like to use these on my bus, however I 
&gt;had a bad problem.  The transmission was only controlled via vaccum from 
&gt;the engine and the total seal rings wacked it out because they have no 
&gt;loss etc.  Is this going to pose a problem on my auto on the bus?

Don't know, but I am considering those rings also.
