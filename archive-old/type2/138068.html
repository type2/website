Seems all the links here are dead.  Man, it's just tantalizing to see 
all of the topics covered.  From my internet searches, it seems Mr. 
Hoover did not want his sermons published any longer.  I can't pretend 
to stand in his shoes, but I don't understand why someone who seemed so 
free with his knowledge would suddenly retract it all.  I'm sure there 
are many recent owners like us who would benefit from his experience 
and enjoy his stories.

cheers,
joe
