Subject: Re: [T2] Good Infrared thermometer source?

Hi Mike,

I needed an IR thermometer recently for my day job and googled up a   
supplier within two blocks of home:
http://www.scigiene_dot_com/cat46_1.htm

Their model TN203 sells for $49US but the range only goes to 485F.  
It's adequate for assessing oil and head temps, but not for exhaust  
work.
They sell a variety of models with different price and temperature  
ranges; the TN203 was exactly what I needed for the job at hand.

Happy trails,
