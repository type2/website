Subject: Child's hammock

Hi All,

I have a child's hammock with poles (tan) that is original (and in 
nearly new condition) but has apparently rarely, if ever, been used.  
It came with my 1976 westy but I've never used it (though certainly 
used the one on my first westy).  My kids are grown and even my 
grandkids are big enough to go upstairs.  If you have little ones and 
think you can put it to good use send me your delivery information and 
it's yours.  Since I'm giving it away and only want it to be of value 
to someone, please allow me to send it to you COD.  Thanks.

Jeff
