Subject: '73 auto - Heater blower and red (alt) light glow

I noticed that connecting up my heater blower causes my alternator light
to faintly glow - not enough to see during the day, but clearly visible
at night.  This probably explains some of the on and off starting
problems I'd been having last fall before I took it off the road for the
winter.  Disconnecting the blower clearly takes away the &quot;glow.&quot;

I just pulled the motor and tore it down for a look and a clean and
lube.  It seems to be intact;  it spins, it runs fine, pushes lots of
air, brushes intact, no squealing, no obvious weirdness visible when I
took it apart.  I thought that maybe it wasn't grounding, so I &quot;jumped&quot;
it to a ground, but that didn't change anything.

Can the motor just be shorting out internally so that it is discharging
my battery when it is connected up and running ?  Any fixes, other than
replace (repair?) motor? Anything else to look for?

Thanks.
