Subject: Re: [T2] It's not fixed.

I recently had a similar issue. I thought I was out of gas. Poured in
a can of gas, took off for the gas station and died at the stop sign.
Took the line off the filter and blew back into the tank. Felt a pop
and release. Never had another trouble with it.

 Sounds like a fuel flow issue.

 Is the fuel tank outlet blocked?
