&gt;&gt; Last night on the Simpson's Halloween Special, the first of three that
&gt;&gt; night, I think it was a re-run, there was a green on green splittie that
&gt;&gt; got crushed by a giant Ken Brockman (I think it was Ken).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It was only on screen for a second, so I couldn't get more of an ID.

&gt;I saw this!  It was the giant neon beer advertising mascot who crushed
&gt;the hippies with his gian beer bottle.  Not only did he crush them, he
&gt;turned the bottle side to side to really smear 'em good :)
&gt;
&gt;I love the Simpsons!  Also saw that green VW Thing in the &quot;Who shot Mr.
&gt;Burns&quot; outtakes :)

I watched part of this too, and saw the episode where the really tall guy
all scrunched up in the VW Beetle yells at the bully kid for laughing at
him.  Would have watched more of them but we were having major
thunderstorms last night and the cable kept going out.  So, I hopped in the
bus, drove thru the flooded roads (fun!) to Blockbuster and rented &quot;Fargo&quot;.
Didn't see any busses in the movie but it was interesting anyway.
Reminded me of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.
