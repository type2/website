Subject: Re: [T2] UK VW Camper Magazine

I'm here in Canada and received mine early last week (issue 15, summer
2004).  They did somehow not send me issue 12 though and now its sold out.
They said they'd send me one if they come across one, but I don't think its
going to happen.  Anyone have one they are done with and want to sell?
