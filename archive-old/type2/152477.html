Nick,
I believe that timing for total advance means nothing when it comes to
timing a vacuum dizzy. The vacuum may be very different when you are driving
at freeway speed than what it is when you time at 3000 rpm in the shop.
The book says it is timed at idle -and 009 is a different story of course.

&gt; Interesting. I usually time to total advance because I normally have 009
&gt; dizzys on board for a '71 Bus. I figure that if I go with what is maxed out
&gt; when the thing is screaming, I know it won't go over that figure (in this
&gt; case 31 degrees at about 4000 rpm). 5 degrees ATDC would probably put it at
&gt; about 26 degrees at full bore which is closer to the &quot;22-25deg _at_ 3800rpm&quot;
&gt; figure for centrifugal dizzys shown in your reference.
