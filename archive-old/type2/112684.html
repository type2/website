Subject: rod orientation

Please o' list sages:

I'm in the process of getting my 2.0 GE back together and have a
question about the rod orientation.  It's obvious this engine's been
rebuilt before (and not very well at that)  Bentley states that the
forge marks on the rods must face upwards on page 68 (engine and clutch)
figure 18-3. (even though the crank in this pic looks like a type 1
enginee)  However, my rods have no forge marks.  They do have numbers on
both halves right at the shank near the bolt.  When the rods are in
normal operating orientation as in:
&lt;o----O
	Ox----o&gt;
&lt;o----0
	0x----o&gt;
(where x = the number)
the numbers are on top of two of them but on the bottom of 2 of them. 
When the rods are all in the same orientation as in:
    0x-----o&gt;
	0x------o&gt;
    0x-----o&gt;
	0x------o&gt;
all the numbers are on the same side.  (I hope this makes sense)
Common sense tells me that all the numbers should be on the same side in
operating orientation.  Is there a top and a bottom?  Please help if you
can.  TIA, Greg
