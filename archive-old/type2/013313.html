Subject: Flogging an '82
Mime-Version: 1.0

No real point to this message just a story.

When I got the auto, with A/C, '82 westy going on it's 3rd engine at
76k miles I further mocked the fact it had a rather HD class 1 trailer
hitch (more than the average tow bolt hitch) and chuckled about no
wonder why the original owner lost 2 engines in that amount of time.

Well I went to buy a real HD tow dolly Wednesday up around Pontiac,
MI (why didn't anyone mention the VWoA show was this weekend) to
use to tow back the '95 EVC (not to be done with the '82.)  Circumstances
were such that the only thing readily available to do it was the '82, and
hey, look at that hitch.  Now since I put the rebuild in the '82 I've been
somewhat depressed as compression wasn't exactly what I thought
it would end up, and it has run 10-15F hotter than I thought it should,
even in that pig of a chassis.  So I'm heading out of WV through PA,
OH, over to MI, 375 miles or so each way, and I figure, what the F, I'm
going to beat the damn thing to the ground (I've picked up a set of
96mm P&amp;C's for it anyway.)  Anyway the neat point of this is that
about halfway through, somewhere in OH, I start noticing the steady
state cruising temps at 65 are falling from 240ish on a grade down to
about 220 or so, and the power (real subjective here) also seems better
and I don't think its just Ohio (flat.)  Then the real suprise I'm getting
16+ mpg (it has been getting 12-14.)  Well I get up there, get the dolly
which is a commercial 850# sort of thing and take off back for home.
It towed amazingly well, across OH I had no problem doing 60-65 and
even was OK in the hills of PA though I had to go to 2nd and 45mph it
was no worse than the same trip before unloaded.  The vanagon towed
the thing like it wasn't even there as far as buffeting etc.

Anyway to get to the point of all this, I got this P&amp;C set second hand
cheap as the rings, pins, and retainers had been lost so I had used
a nice set of used pins, retainers, and bought the Bus Depot bargain
set of $20 Brazilian rings.  Went out and checked compression this
morning and all are sitting 120-125ish just like they always should have
been (a couple had been down around 105-110) before.  The moral,
apparently it took 6000 miles and a good beating to finally get these
things to seat, and yes I had performed proper breakin and ring seating
exercises on the bench before I even installed the engine.

Go figure.  Now I don't know if I'm going to put in those 96s.
