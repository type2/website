&gt; Greetings to the List,
&gt;
&gt; I had planned on installing European taillights in my 70 Bus.  I say, &quot;had
&gt; planned&quot; because when I went to order the bulb housing, lens, and seal
&gt; Wolfsburg West (who had them listed in their catalog) told me they were
out
&gt; and they wouldn't be getting any more.  A quick search of the usual places
&gt; turned nada.
&gt; So Listerinos, does anyone out there know of a source for European
taillight
&gt; bulb housings?  I figure I can scrounge the lenses and seals.  Sure would
&gt; appreciate a lead on this one!
