I must agree with George Lyle.  Nevada's stretch of &quot;the loneliest road in America&quot; is beautiful, and the nights in this desert cool down nicely.  Don't forget spares: tire, belts etc.  There is a reason why its called the loneliest road.

I would also recommend the Yellowstone/Grand Teton Nat'l parks north of Jackson Wyoming, they are incredible but full of tourists.
