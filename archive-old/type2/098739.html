Subject: Re: [T2] mysterious rattle

damn! i think my problem is more severe than i thought. the metal the
bolt goes through is no longer an enclosed circle, if it ever was (if
not, someone please tell me). the top of the circle is missing and there
appears to be a ring of metal around the bolt, as if the metal the bolt
goes through had broken. i felt behind that wall and i can feel the back
end of the bolt, so i dont THINK tightening down the bolt will do
anything at all. i need to jack it up and remove the wheel to inspect it
better, but from what i could see, it looks like i will have to have
someone weld it for me.

again, how bad/dangerous is it to drive with the shock not bolted at the
top?

&gt; Chris, I put shocks on a '70 about a year ago.  I think the top bolt 
&gt; does not have a removable nut.  I know the later buses screws into 
&gt; the body.  I believe the bottom bolt removes.

&gt; guess what i found out that noise was? the bolt through the top of  the
&gt; left rear shock was out! it is still in the shock, but it isnt 
attached
&gt; to the bus. is there a bolt on the back or does it bolt into the  body?
if
&gt; the latter is the case, then i will bolt it back in tomorrow (when i 
can
&gt; see what i am doing) but if it is supposed to have a nut on the  back,
&gt; then i think i am screwed. i am fairly certain it is gone. is there  a
&gt; bolt on my 65 beetle i can steal to get a replacement?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,

&gt; ps~ how bad/dangerous is it to drive with the shock not secured as  it
has
&gt; been the last week or so?
