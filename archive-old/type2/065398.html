&gt;Isn't the &quot;wider body&quot; that shows up in the specs just the wider flares on
&gt;the wheel-wells in 1979?

Dunno. I thought this was settled, but it appears it ain't. It would argue
that the 70 has a wider body than the 69 if this is true, because the 70
has more flair in the rear wheel wells, but I don't think anybody claims
that...
