Subject: Re: [T2] painting an engine

Hi Voks,
I would like to add my .02 on this topic as my tin is
currentley drying in the shop.  I painted the tin
black for heat transfer (black absorbes the full
spectum of light including IR)  which causes heat to
be &quot;pulled&quot; away from the engine. This is why chrome
or white is a bad idea, it looks clean but reflects
much of the light spectrum back at the engine. I did
not paint the engine case because I agree with the
theory that it will act like a blanket of sort around
your engine.  
However, as someone pointed out what evidence is
there? The real issue will be a combination of thermal
transer rate of the type of paint you use, and the
surface area involved. In this case a less than smooth
finish would be desireable because it will allow more
surface area to cool and paint will make the surface
much smoother.  I don't know specifics on the thermal
transfer rate of paint but a rule of thumb is the
better it conducts electricity the better it conducts
heat (there are lots of exceptions to this rule but
generaly it holds true) and paint does not conduct
electricity well.
For these reasons I feel it is a good idea to paint
your tin a dark/black color and keep your block,
heads, and jugs power washed clean.

One final thought, I was going to paint the
transmission an enamel white to keep it running
cooler.  The white would reflect the IR heat from the
engine and hot road surface in the summer.  However,
as discussed above it will most likely add some
insulation factor.  Any thoughts?
Rick

&gt; &gt;Painting an engine case is a very bad idea.  You
&gt; want the heat to dissipate,
&gt; &gt;paint is insulating it in the case.........it seems
&gt; that Berg wrote about
&gt; &gt;this or maybe Hoover........
&gt; 
&gt; interesting theory- i've never found any proof.
&gt; anyone ?
&gt; i've also seen some deep-end stuff from Berg that
&gt; borders on insanity.
&gt; Perhaps if a thing is repeated often enough it
&gt; simply becomes true.
