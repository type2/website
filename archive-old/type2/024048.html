Subject: [T2] Pop-Top Canvas Replacement

I wanted to thank everyone that has given me ideas on repairing/replacing
the pop-Top canvas on my 1971 Riviera. It's been very helpful. What a
wonderful resource!

It looks like my best bet is to get the canvas off, inspect it and decide if
it just needs some minor repairs or a full replacement. I now have ideas
what to look for and where to look for them.

Thanks again!
