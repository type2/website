Subject: Wanted Carb and maniflod for 79 bush.
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I would like to get my 79 rolling my other wheels are seriously sick.
Does any one have a crab and manifold setup that will work on a
79 FI bus. I can do some matching and welding.

I would also consider a carberated engine that would drop in with out
too much trouble and getting the FI mill out on the stand and see what I 
can do about fixing the FI.

thanks
Gordon
