&gt; hey gang,
&gt; 
&gt; the new(old) slider window finally came today. 
I think it's the old style (spring'd lock you have to open 
before sliding screen will open so you can open the glass. 
Seems my glass doesn't lock, correct? Seems odd. 
There's a handle high up on the glass, seems like the lip of it is broken off tho, you have to get it with your finger nails.
&gt; 
&gt; q: are these reversible (fit in either window)?
&gt; 
&gt; q: does the multi-ribs side of the seal go towards the interior of the bus?
&gt; 
&gt; Later,
