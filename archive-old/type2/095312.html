&gt;hello
&gt;
&gt;im a bit new to megasquirt, i did a bit of search on type 2 archive, but i
&gt;cant find some information.  Ill try to resume what ive found and maybe a 
&gt;FI
&gt;guru could complete for the benefit of all !

Mike

I am not a guru and have no desire to be one. It is too stressful to have to 
have all the right answers all the time even on something as simple as a VW 
bus.

Anyway here is my take on FI starting from a T2 base. Learn the stock 
system. Get a copy of Bosch Fuel Injection &amp; Engine Management by Charles O. 
Probst,SAE and read and understand at least the basic chapters. Get The VW 
T2 Bentley Service Manual and learn your own system. Research your questions 
from a solid base.

Not many people that have busted their butt to really learn the basics have 
the patience to answer anyone, in over their head, shot gunning unresearched 
questions. God bless those kind few that do.

Chuck
