George,

It is a standard 3 prong flasher. relay  I used to carry a spare 
flasher relay and swap them when the one in the fuse box filled with 
water. I have since fixed the windshield :) You should pull the one 
out of your bug( you have one don't you) and swap it in to see if 
that cures your problem. The relay is available at any FLAPS for $6 
or so dollars. They are common to buses, bugs, ghias and things of 
the early 70s on.
