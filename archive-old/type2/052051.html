More wizbang with cheaper parts is a market demand. All the manufacturer
dealers have low inventories for recent cars, maintenance parts only. Go
ask your local Range Rover dealer if they have cheap plastic replacement
parts on hand for 2000 productions. Then check their backorder availability
and price. Perhaps then your opinion of VWoA with sit a notch above bottom
of the barrel.
