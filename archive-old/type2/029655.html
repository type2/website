&gt; In reference to this problem, I haven't seen anyone mention the screen in
&gt; the fuel tank outlet. 

&gt; Maybe the injected buses don't have this screen? 

Fuel injected buses do *not* have this screen.  Only single outlet gas
tanks have it.  FI buses have an outlet and a return, both of which are
welded to the bottom of the tank.  If you do have an obstructed supply
pipe, the only solution is to remove the tank and have it cleaned.

If you suspect that this may be the case, by all means check your fuel
pressure first.
