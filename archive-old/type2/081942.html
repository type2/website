Subject: EB Group Photo  (FMBC and T2) and last chance for patches....(maybe)

If anyone wants to be in a FMBC group Picture, gather around my bus around
1pm on Sat. (For those that don't know what my bus looks like
(http://quicksitemaker_dot_com/members/snoop/SnoopyBus.html) Someone tried this
last year but it didn't work, figured I'd try this year.

On another note How about a T2 group pic around 1:30 or just after the FMBC
pic.

AS for the official FMBC patches.  I am taking what I have left to Everybus
and if you
can't make it and you want one.  You will need to follow this link and order
one thru the mail.    http://www.geocities_dot_com/snoopyvwbus/patches.html  I
may have some left after EB or may not.  So if you really want one of these
limited edition patches (only 100 of each were made)   You better get me
your order by Wed, as I am leaving Thurs early am for EB.

You do not have to be a Moonie to get one but after all membership is free,
so why not join???
