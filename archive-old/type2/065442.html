I'd like to hear Tom Johnson's feedback
&gt;on which heaters used Bosch parts (if he's not busy in his workshop forging
&gt;a 40 HP crank ;).

As far as I know, none of the VW heaters used Bosch parts.  I just dug
through my Eberspacher parts and zip.  Beru and SWF but no Bosch.  This by
no means definitive, but I've never encountered any.

As for that crankshaft...Hopefully 3's the charm
