Subject: Bike Rack / 2&quot; receiver on 77 Westy

I'm stumped on figuring out how to carry 4 bikes on my 77 Westy. I would 
prefer to put a 2&quot; reciever hitch on the back. If I could there are plenty 
of racks that hold 4 bikes. But all of the local hitch places I've tried 
here in Atlanta don't have one. I can order a traditioal hitch from Rocky 
Mtn Motorworks but the rack manufacturers only have 2 bike carriers for that 
style of hitch. I'm sure it has to do with the tounge weight.

Any ideas where I can order a 2&quot; receiver hitch? I realize my bumper is a 
flimsy brazilian POS and could not hold much weight. But there are two 
brackets below where the bumper mounts that looks like they could be useful 
in reinforcing/supporting the hitch to the bumper.

I want to be able to check the oil and open the back hatch without removing 
the bikes. Most of the hitch racks will hinge forward.

Many Thanks in advance!
