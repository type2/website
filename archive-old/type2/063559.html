Hi Jake

&gt; Also, something i noticed that i wanted to check out with everybody.
&gt; Usually when i decellerate(sp.) i can hear a little bit of backfire from the
&gt; engine, almost like pop-corn but not just the average sound of a vw.  my
&gt; mechanic said he couldn't even hear it when he drove it, but i'm not sure i
&gt; trust him enough and i'm  really not  a mechanical person.  

If you have a leak in the exhaust system, then you'll get this.  If it's
just like a little popcorn sound, it'll be a little leak.  That's not bad,
except chasing it down might be a problem.  Could be anything from the
exhaust manifolds on out to the muffler.

My '77 recently had a nice job done on it's exhaust by the local VW
guru who took the time and care to change a busted stud at the exhaust
manifold, and welded up one of the heat exchangers.  The exhaust no longer
pops when the bus is driving the engine (deceleration in gear).  Yay!

        TTFN

&gt; BTW, i'm looking for a new mechanic in the Boston area--anybody out there
&gt; know of one?

How about Klick and Klack in Cambridge? :-)
