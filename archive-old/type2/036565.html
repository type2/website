&gt; To George Lyle et al:  MB here with my business signature- I'm the guy
&gt; with the 213,000 orig. miles on the engine, except for a replaced clutch
&gt; friction disk at 150K and changed hydraulic lifters/seals.  Even the
&gt; alternator, distributor, fuel pump, etc are original!  The posts on
&gt; needle bearing got me to wondering.....an odd, intermittant symptom is
&gt; occuring, noticed when I push the clutch in, say to stop at a light.....
&gt; you hear a funny &quot;deep&quot; noise (like in trans to engine area when you are
&gt; driving) which sounds/feels kinda like the clutch is briefly engaging-
&gt; not constant, just a little hiccup of a rumble.   It does not get worse
&gt; if I &quot;rev&quot; the engine with clutch pedal in, actually, better.   This is
&gt; fixed by just putting it in neutral to wait and shift to drive off. 

The fact that it is fixed with the clutch engaged indicates that there is
some problem with the
pressure plate, disk, throwout bearing, or pilot bearing, as these parts
only move when the clutch is in.

&gt; Shifting is ok, although getting into 1st is sometimes difficult, as is
&gt; 1st to second if I do it on a steep hill.  While driving and shifting,
&gt; no problems.  Could this in any way be due to some wobble in the clutch
&gt; disk if the needle bearing is going/gone?  Anyone know wht the symptoms
&gt; are if it's gone?  

Anything from a noise to a complete lockup.

&gt;      When I changed the disk in 1995, I can't remember greasing the
&gt; flywheel hole, and did have an odd symptom somewhere camping in the
&gt; rockies- on a wet FOGGY morning, the car acted like
&gt; the clutch was engaged even when pedal was all the way down (ie, the car
&gt; jumped when I started it).  I can't remember if I had trouble shifting
&gt; after trying it in neutral, but I think it &quot;broke free&quot; and started ok
&gt; after that, with no such trouble for next 5 years!  Maybe the damp
&gt; somehow &quot;glued&quot; the disk to the pressure plate?

Possible.  if the disk-flywheel surface got damp the disk could rust
itself to the pressure plate and flywheel, just as rear brake shoes stick
to the drum in the wet.

&gt;  I do get shuddering on
&gt; lots of traffic shifting when it heats up -when clutch is let out and
&gt; shudders, I just push it in and let it out again.  I had that symptom on
&gt; the original disk, which I noted had one broken spring.  So what's going
&gt; on- can I assume that high revs create a gyroscope effect (like a bike
&gt; wheel, it centers itslf easier, or is it just held by the pressure
&gt; plate?, but at low reves (clutch in , 900 rpm) it may wobble causing the
&gt; &quot;engaging&quot; sound here and there even with release bearing doing its
&gt; thing?  

It might be that the disk is a bit out of true, and when it warms up it
warps more.  It also might be that the pilot bearing is sticking.  Both
would cause a &quot;draggy clutch&quot; feeling.

Cure is pretty much the same for both.  Remove engine and look at the
offending components.  Trashed needle bearing is usually obvious.  Warped
disk is less obvious, but it's prudent to replace the disk whenever the
clutch is apart.

Be sure to attend to this problem.  If it is the needle bearing and the
bearing siezes up you might have a heck of a time getting the engine
separated from the transmission.  Been there done that!
