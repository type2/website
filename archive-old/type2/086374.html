Subject: emails sent to BUStedBUS

Hello folks,

I have gotten some feedback that some emails have not been returned. It
turns out that most of them have not been found right away because they have
been replies to our type2 posts which are filtered into a sub folder. While
we try to read all of the posts we do miss some. If you have not seen a
reply to you email it is probably because it has the [T2] in the subject. I
am trying to fix this. I would also like to say sorry to anyone that this
has affected, especially me. Later and happy busing. It sure feels like bus
driving weather around here.
