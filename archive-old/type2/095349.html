Subject: VW dealers: Dont get me started  RANT


So I went with a friend who wanted to buy a new car:

We have looked at this and that and went to the VW dealer. Of course I went 
to parts and had them look up all the stuff thats on their computer but cant 
possibly order! Oh well, thats ok, I let it slide....

SO I went out to the salesman. (He had no idea I was irritating the parts 
guys BTW)

I had my son with me. He's three and I dont test drive with him, so I say, 
as we are looking at a sporty new VW,  &quot;I would test it, but my son is with 
me...&quot; He says I can not test drive that car. I sit down inside it and 
laugh, well come back later to test it, it feels nice as I play with the 
gears and what not. He says, &quot;No you cannot ever test drive this car, nobody 
is allowed to&quot;. I look at him like he's crazy, and say why not?
No test drives on this car only so many were made. WHAT? I cant test a car I 
might buy!?!?!? Are they insane?
I look at him and start to laugh.  A little, then more, because it's a damn 
VW for goodness sake.
NOPE no driving this car.
I then ask for specs. Then (I was with a friend whos dad is from Germany) I 
said well my bug out performs this car anyway. He is not happy about that, 
not at all. Then my freind goes off about how its a peoples car and how BMW 
or Mercedes wouldnt try this kind of crap at their showrooms.....

I had to agree, I have test driven 911's! Hell I learned how to drive 
switching between a 1964 Beetle and a 1979 Porche 928s directly imported 
from Germany (and I was 15!) The bus I owned was older then this salesman.

He stuck to his guns. &quot;Only 1 car is allowed by the dealership and the rules 
are that no one gets to drive it&quot;.

OK Volkswagen. You win. You have insisted on copyrights to kill the 
aftermarket, and now you wont even let someone testdrive your cars.

I will buy a Toyota. Thank you for helping me make the decision.
Jason
