&gt; If you folks are talking about heater box eliminator pipes, we have them.
&gt; They fit 1972 - 1979 Bus engines.
&gt; 
Now you tell me!!?!?!?!?!?  why couldn't I find them last year when I was
looking, I know I didn't ask you

how much are they (78 with automatic) and do you have a piece of tin that
goes under the pushrod tubes but above the exhaust so the thermostat will
operate properly
