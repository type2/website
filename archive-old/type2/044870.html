This is the kind of thing that sticks with you. I feel very sorry for Kristen 
Ann, but sadder for the loved ones left behind. The tragedy will be ever 
present with them. 

Wish we could let them know our thoughts and prayers are with them. 

Things like this make me believe stronger in the notion that they will get 
theirs in the end.
