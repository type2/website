Hi all,
     I have a '72 sunroof bus that I am parting out.  If anyone needs
anything, please let me know.  The bus is located near Chattanooga, TN.
Engine and trans are already gone.  The bus has a good front axle, and the
body is relatively rust free and I believe the bus could be put back on the
road if given enough love (and engine and trans).  Anyway, if you want any
parts, let me know.  If you want the whole thing, come tow it away for
$150.00.  The bus does not have the middle seat or the front seats, and the
window regulator for the drivers door is gone and all the door locks/handles
are gone.

Does anyone know how to get into a VW chatroom (irc) using webtv?

Stuart
