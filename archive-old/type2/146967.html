Subject: how long a themostat last

Hi Volks ,
Is anyone knows how long a thermostat last  ? what are  their life 
expectancy ?
Just try to plan ahead and buy a couple of them before you can't find 
them anymore.
Is anyone tried to install a manual one like a cable which could open 
and close the flap , something equivalent of the old shokes ?
