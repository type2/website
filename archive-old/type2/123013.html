Subject: Type2 Gas Mileage

&quot;I average between 21 and 23 miles/gal
while fully loaded for a long trip(4weeks or more)
with the family with my stock 79Westy with the 2L FI.

Chuck and list,

How fast are you driving? I seem to get 15-17 on the highway in my 78'
westy loaded travelling around 65-70, but closer to 70. Timing and dwell
are dead on. 2.0FI stock except for mild webcam and 8.5:1 compression. I
have wondered about my FI mixture but don't have an exhaust gas analyzer to
test. May try the emissions inspection (breathalizer folks as I like to
call em) but I don't know if they will give me a test if my bus doesn't
require one. (antique tags) plus if its not on they are not likely to let
me adjust while hooked up to their sniffer...
