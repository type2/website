Subject: RE: [T2] Kick panels

&gt; Has anyone bought the ABS kick panels from Just Campers in the
&gt; UK?  Mine are badly water damaged from a leaky windshield seal/rust and
I'm
&gt; wondering how well these fit and what the finish is like.


They just became available, and we are now shipping them instead of the
cardboard ones that everyone else sells (since we are Just Kampers' U.S.
distributor).  They look quite similar to the stock ones (not identical, of
course, since the finish is black ABS rather than vinyl-over-cardboard, but
very close).  They are likely to outlast the cardboard ones by a large
margin; should be the last pair you have to buy.  Also they're much easier
to install without cracking/chipping, as ABS is more flexible and sturdier.
Overall, a better product for the same price. Someone should have done it a
long time ago!
