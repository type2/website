Subject: RE- Oxy-Propane Welding?

For occasional use, if brazing is sufficient for your needs, instead of the 
Oxy-propane rig, which uses propane cylinder sized disposable oxygen cylinders
that don't last long and are very expensive, there are torches that will burn
either straight propane or a gas mixture called MAAP gas.  The MAAP gas 
option is hot enough for brazing light bar or tubing stock, sheet metal, etc.
and although more expensive than regular propane, cheaper than propane-oxygen.

It basically looks like a propane torch head but has a knob that you adjust
depending if you are burning propane or MAAP gas.  Seems to me cost of the
torch head is about $30.
