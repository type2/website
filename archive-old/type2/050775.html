HI All

I have a stock 1971 Westy.

I drove it home from Seattle (250mi) about
3 weeks ago and parked it in the garage.
I was going to clean it and then installed 
a heater duct fan.

The fan install was ok.

Then came time to drive it out. Release the brake
and shift into first. I can feel the clutch engage,
the back of the bus rises up, but does not move.
Very similar symptoms to foot on brake while
giving it the gas (if it were an automatic). 

I assumed frozen parking brake. I jack up the
front to verify wheel spin.

However, the rear wheels will not budge a
fraction of an inch. There appears to be slack in
the E-brake cable and I can hear movement
inside the drums when I give the cables a yank.

I gave the drums more than a few whacks with
a fair size ball peen, but no &quot;boing!&quot; of release
observed. I'm thinking issue is bigger than
a parking brake, but definitely brake related.

I have clutch, neutral and can find all gears
including reverse. Motor starts right up.

Brakes were serviced professionally less than
3500 miles ago and were dragging slightly.

Any shared wisdom is appreciated.

Open bleeders?
