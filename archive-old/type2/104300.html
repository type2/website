&gt; Tyler, do you have any enemies?

I had this happen at a place where I worked.  Someone who apparently didn't
like me loosened the lug nuts on both front tires.  I couldn't figure out
what the vibrations were until I looked closely at the almost completely
backed off lug nuts.

Even with the help of the police, we never discovered which idiot at work
either sincerely wanted me or my family dead or injured, or thought that it
would be a great joke.

Yeah, right...
