Yes! another post (I'm on a roll!), What other wheels will fit my '76 bus? I
have 195 tyres on standard 5 bolt wheels, but all other alloys seem to have
185. I would prefer the larger &quot;footprint&quot; of 195's, but I expect that low
profile 185's keep the speedo accurate.

I know that Carlton wheels will fit, as will some Nissan &amp; Audi 200's. I am
quite happy with the stock wheels, but some alloys DO look nice. But my
needs are more practical, I intend to tour Europe once our baby is born &amp; if
for some reason I need wheels (theft / multiple punctures) it would be nice
to get moving ASAP. I envy the simplicity of living in my bus, but would not
like to be forced to!!

P.S
Europe cars please, telling me mustang wheels fit real nice is no good in
France.
P.P.S
Having just seen the film, I might change the bus' name to &quot;The Big
Lebowski&quot; or &quot;The Deud&quot;
