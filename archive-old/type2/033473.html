Subject: Re: wave to buses

&gt;    I inadvertantly wave at buses all the time.
&gt;
&gt;I do this, too.  Among other things, it solidifies my
&gt;daughters' opinion of me as a kook in a kook's club.

I wave to busses, or rather the drivers and most all wave back.

I have a 23 year old son and his friends tell him &quot;Your dad is so 
cool!&quot; I suspect my son's mileage varies. But sony boy is just 
jealous, I have longer hair and my beard is better.
