Subject: Refurbishing the shift linkage

Hi Volks,

Following some engine trouble during the JBB trip I pulled the motor  
from the westfakia. And since I also had been having some issues with  
the transmission following the linkage failure on the way to  
BusFusion, I have decided this is a good time to get things sorted  
out properly.

Ever since I've had the westfakia on the road the shifting has not  
been precise. In fact, some might even say it's been downright  
sloppy. I am using a 3-rib tranny in a 1979 chassis, and I  
compensated for the 79's shorter shift linkage by bending the shift  
lever. This worked great for 5 years, but in the long run it's not  
the best solution. I have acquired a stock stickshift and have  
decided to modify a rear linkage connector to add the extra required  
length at the back instead of at the front of the linkage.

I did try to improve things some back in the spring of 2001. I  
replaced the front bushing at that time but decided against  
replacing             the rear bushings because I didn't have time,  
tools, or expertise to drop the transmission. My wife and I gradually  
got used to the shift pattern. It's only when I drive someone else's  
bus (or vice-versa) that the problem becomes apparent.

This morning I delivered the transmission to a local (80 miles away)  
specialist who will resolve the problem with the third gear  
synchromesh. When I get it back, I'd like to have the linkage in good  
working order. I'm also interested in a short-shift kit, if this is a  
good time to add one. Any advice on where would I get one would be  
appreciated.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
