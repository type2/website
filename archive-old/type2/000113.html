Subject: Pictures of Unusual Transporters wanted.
Message-ID: &lt;0.8e8b66ed.2538f95b_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi all,

As you may be aware I run the web pages at www.soft_dot_net_dot_uk/vwt2oc for the VW 
Type 2 Owners Club (UK club with 2800 members). 

I would like to add a sub-page to our web site for unusual Type 2s 
(Splitties, Bays, Wedges or Eurovan) - So does any one have pictures on the 
web of unusual Type 2 that I could use?

Please do not send the pictures just the URLs to pictures along with a few 
words as to what is in the pictures, so that I can select and down load 
without running up a giant phone bill to down load pictures which I may not 
then want to use.

Also please do not send the URLs of pictures for which you have the 
copyright; any pics I use will get a copyright credit.

So what is unusual? 

Any pictures of vehicles with unusual factory options - provided those 
options are shown to good effect (eg flag holder, repeater indicators (side 
or roof), rifle racks, ambulance, blackout screens, factory side step, 
ambulance, full height bulkheads, extra high sliding door, long arm door 
mirrors, wide bed pick up....)

Anything coach built after it left Wolfsburg / Hanover / Graz IS unusual 
including fire-engines, hearses, cinema projection vans, hot dog vans, cherry 
pickers, police vans (especially with the radar-trap door in the front 
panel), jet engine starter vans, half tracks, mobile workshops Kemperinks, 
Jurgens Autovillas, Karmman Gypsies.....

None mainstream camper conversions are unusual (ie Westfalias,   Devon, 
Danbury, Dormobiles or other mainstream conversions are NOT unusual). The 
interior of one converter with the pop-top of another would be unusual 
provided the interior is clearly shown.

Any UNIQUE, outrageous, hideous, or monsterous owner mods would be considered 
unusual too (eg a splittie van with a lage pigs nose on the front)

Pictures which are distinctly representative of NON-European production 
vehicles would also be considered unusual (eg Japan, South Africa, New 
Zealand, Mexico, Brazil)

Ok, you've got the idea?

Although I will be grateful for any URLs I am sent I must reserve the right 
to use or not as I feel appropriate.

PLEASE DO NOT send your replies to the type 2 E-mail list, just personal mail 
to me please.

When the page is done I will let all you good folk know it's there.

Thanks in advance for anything I'm sent
