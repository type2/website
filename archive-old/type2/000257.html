Those of you who know of us by mail will know of the questions I've put to
the list.....until recently, thought unrelated.
I have been digging 'round in the type2 archives, have gotten a copy,
(however recently controversial), of Muir's bible, and do believe that a
picture.....apparently expensive, may be forming.
 I have had some idling problems recently, which I have put down to a
plugged heat riser.
 I recently replaced the coil due to power loss after one hour plus periods
on the motorway...( either dying coil or carb icing-see above )
 ....but only now, with the weird stiffening-up (burning smell) and later
slacking off of the brake pedal during these bouts of power loss - and my
increased reading in both books and _at_ type2_dot_com......
.............aaaaaarrrrggghh....no, not the dreaded brake booster
syndrome...
could this be?.....how can I tell, and is it really as expensive as it
sounds.
	I will no-doubt be staying up all night and revising the exact workings of
a t2 braking system....but as always would like a general consensus before
loosing my proverbial.......
Thanks once again
Garp
