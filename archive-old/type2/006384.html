The sump sender is the best thing I have found for an all around temp
reading, we have gotten readings from about everywhere...

&gt; I'm concerned that the sump sender would be affected by the leakage of
&gt; heat conducted out to the finned sump and loweing the reading- how do
&gt; they insulate from that?  The sump has different surface temperatures
&gt; when in traffic or the open road; same if it rains.  The dipstick sender
&gt; I made from a meat thermometer hangs in the oil without touching the
&gt; bottom.  Yanking the sender and getting the dipstick is not such a big
&gt; deal, and I do it at every gas fillup.
&gt;    One subject to address is: Isn't the oil sucked up at the sump going
&gt; throught the oil cooler before the bearings- ie it will be cooler that
&gt; the sump temp.  It's all relative, and will at least warn us if it goes
&gt; abnormally above what we know is normal at a given speed and outside
&gt; temp.   MB  227,000 mi on original engine

&gt; &gt; sender is somehow inferior to a dipstick sender.  If you really want the
&gt; &gt; hassle of wires hanging in your engine compartment and having to carry a
&gt; &gt; separate dipstick with you and insert it every time you want to check
the
&gt; &gt; oil, be my guest - but don't do it because you think you are getting a
&gt; &gt; better reading in &quot;hotter oil&quot; because it's simply not true.
