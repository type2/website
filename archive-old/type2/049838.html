Subject: [T2] Junkyard Locations

I just stumbled across this link and figured with all the &quot;does anyone know of a
junkyard in ....&quot; questions, this should pretty much answer all of them.

http://www.junkyards_dot_com/automotive/directory/directory.htm

Lists nationwide junkyards and is organized by state then city.

Happy Junkyard Diving!

Scott
