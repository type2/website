Subject: Where to buy tire chains in Bay Area or Sacremento?

I have a 72 bus with rear tires size LT195/75R14

I've tried a few FLAPS and tire stores in SF, nobody seems to have this size.

I've leaving for Tahoe tomorrow and would like to pick some chains up 
along the way.  Does anyone have a suggestion of where to buy them?

Also, is LT195/75R14 the correct rear tire size for a 72?  If not, what is?
