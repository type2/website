I've lived and camped all over this great country in vans that  were decorated
with no concession to propriety.  The only time I ever encountered a police
officer was one night in Narragansett, R.I.  I was parked in a shopping center,
and the constable told me how to find a nice deserted side road nearby where
noone would bother me.  I woke up in a beautiful spot, thanks to that helpful
advice.
