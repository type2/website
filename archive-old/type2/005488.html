Dear fellow Westy owners.

I am new to the list and hoping to pick up lots of tips and information.

Just last week I got a much searched for 82 air-cooled Westy.

Issue # 1;  It is in need of a engine as it burns/leaks oil and the valves
make a racket, plus it is leaning right on the front, due to a broken
torsion bar (so said the mechanic).  I have priced out a VW remanufactured
engine at $2800 but with VW labor rate it becomes prohibitive.  Does anyone
have any recommendations for a local rebuilder, or remanufacture that has
worked well for you.  I am trying to avoid the California sources due to
warranty complications.  A recommended mechanic would also be appreciated.

Issue # 2; Do you carry a canoe on top of your popup, if so how?

I am in central New Jersey.

Thanks for your opinions and recommendations.
Hope to see you on the road.

Alex
