&gt; &gt;I just called Painter's Grinding and they have both the normal

&gt; &gt;The leaky head I have in my garage also has this spacer thing on the intake.
&gt;
&gt; My understanding is that the phenolic blocks were for FI engines, specifically
&gt; to help keep heat from getting to the injectors.  VW used phenolic blocks
&gt; on injected Type III's for the same reason.

Hal,

You are not wrong.  The phenolic gaskets are for FI, the wrung metal are
for carburetor.  The metal allows heat to pas from the head to the intake
manifold to prevent icing (short as it is, it can still ice up).  The
phenolic *prevents* heat from passing to the intake runners and fuel
injectors as you suspected.

Don,

You want the wrung metal gaskets.  No (or a very light coat of) gasket
cement, 14 ft/lb as you said.

OOK!
