Subject: Timing ??

        I have been trying to get my '73 Westy moving again.  We have
re-done carbs, checked valves, points, new vaccum advance diaphragm, and
been through the timing thing &gt;several&lt; times.  I understand that it should
be 10 degrees after (towards the top) of top dead center.  I just got a new
timing band, but it doesn't seem right.  Low power, too high of an idle,
etc.....
        Also, how do I know if I am in need of a new engine seal....how much
oil in that area is acceptable?

Gotta love these Vee-Dubs.

Thanks a bunch-

Have a Nice Day :)
