Subject: Locally manufactured tool book

&gt; Every once in a while I post a plea to anyone holding a copy of the
&gt; 'Locally made tools' book published by VW for their dealers.
&gt; 
&gt; I have yet to get my hands on one or even get info on some of
&gt; the contents.
&gt; 
&gt; Soooooooooo. Does anyone have access to this publication?

Yes, I have that publication.

&gt; 
&gt; Would you be prepared to copy it for me? (All costs covered!)

Certainly not. It is very thick and consists mostly of fold-outs.

 
&gt; Would you be prepared to publish on the web?

You can not imagine the volume of that book and my computer illiteracy.


&gt; Am I banging my head against a brick wall?

If you need a specific tool drawing and send me a SASE plus one Dollar I
can copy it.
 
&gt; Fame and fortune awaits the first to go public...........

They are not really all that rare. I've seen a few for sale, although
not yet in the US. The UK seems best for old org. VW literature.
Scandinavia is also very good.
