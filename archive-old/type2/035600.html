&gt;Hi, As I am getting to know my new 78 Westy I am doing the usual routine.
&gt;Fluid changes, lubing, tightning nuts and bolts, checking for potential
&gt;exhaust and oil leaks ... I have recorded the mileage of its maiden voyage
&gt;at 17.8 UK gal (21.4 US gal) for 352 miles. That is 19.8 miles per imperial
&gt;gallon or 16.4 per US gallon

Hi Bob,

I get 21.4 mpg imperial, largely highway, but that's measured over about
8000 miles of driving. Your figure isn't too far off the mark. If you're
topping off, recording miles and topping off again, your results will be all
over the shop for the first few tankfuls. Give it a bit longer, and your
average will become more representative. However, it's still never going to
be very good with this engine.
