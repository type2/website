Subject: Fuel Injection Info needed....

Anybody familiar with the original VW fuel injection that came out around
'71?  I am retrofitting a Turbo &amp; EFI into my 64 DoubleCab, and I have all
the hardware but no electronics.  I need a 'direct' way to fire my injectors
without major computor/sensor type stuff.
