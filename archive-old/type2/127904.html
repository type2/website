Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Pedal = Stalled Engine

The same thing used to happen to me on every cold start during the 
winter. It was a real pain in the neck and I eventually switched to dual 
carbs. In other words, I don't know how to fix it, but it must be a 
condition not confined to your own bus.

I hooked up my brake servo line to the part in my Weber single (dual barrel)
and the brake servo now kicks in great, but stalls the engine?
