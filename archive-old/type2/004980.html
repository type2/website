Subject: How do you repair a cracked camper top?


My husband and I have a 79 camper which love dearly.We knew nothing about
vans when we bought her and so we ended up with a van that needs much body
work.The camper top is cracked in the back right corner which in turn has
created problems in opening the pop top.It opens but the x bar on the right
is bent and scrapes the top inside and it does not sit up correctly.We can
still use the pop top but I would like to fix it.Any suggestions on where to
begin or can I just buy a new top (if so where?).Thanks,
Eve
