Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trademarks Q&amp;A

I read through their website and my understanding is that they are a 
company who markets their services to corporations. They hunt down websites 
that use trademarked words or names in the address belonging to their clients.

Thus the IP Protector company name.

I'd love to know if they recruited VW as a client or if VW recruited them...

My guess is that for a fee from VW they do away with us in the name of 
protecting a trademark. I'd also bet that they get to keep a portion of 
whatever licensing fees they might collect if not all of each fee collected.

Probably a three person business started by some computer science grad in 
his bedroom over his parent's garage.

They sound big and threatening because that makes them effective.
