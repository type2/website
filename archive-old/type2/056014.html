Subject: Where are yunkjards in the US?

Wolfgang - Hi...

So you are planning a trip in the USofA?

Why do you want to visit so many junk yard buses?  Is there some pieces
that you would like/need, and perhaps you do not need to travel all over
the US to get your pieces. The US is pretty big.

The junkyards in the US are a special breed.  You will lean quickly that
you are considered a foreigner because of your accent. I, too, born and
raised in Pennsylvania, am considered a foreigner in most junkyards
because I do no speak or look like the guy behind the counter.  

Within 30 mile radius of my home, there are at least 10 junk yards that
have late bay buses in various condition.  One yard, called LEON'S in
Culpeper VA, has a MAP on the wall with each vehicle numbered per
location.  You get a list of all vehicles (one group is SPLITs, and
other group is BAYs - for the VWs).  This yard has the MOST in our area,
but they are completely picked over.

Also, the junk yards in this Northern Virginia  tend to CRUSH their
VWs.  I stopped in a junk yard to see the prettiest early bay sitting on
the side of the office.  It was rust free, intact, and really nice.  I
did not want to get too close, because I did not have permission.  Well,
it was my mistake.  That early bay window bus went to the crusher that
very next day.

What you will see today in the junk yard may be there for the next 10-15
years, or it could be gone the next day.  Fresh buses in the junk yard a
QUICKLY picked over for the hard to get pieces.  We call it 'cherry
picking', because the person picks the cherries from the bus.

Plan to spend a LONG time in any one junk yard that you visit.  Spend a
long time with the counter man, before you go out in the yard.  He will
price things out according to what his computer says, or how he feels
(his 'how he feels' price is usually only 20-25% of the computer price.)

There are over 50 - 60 junk yards in my area.  About 20 of them are
owned by the same person (who, incidently, is German!!  he hangs out at
SAVE MORE junk yard in Oxen Hill Maryland) and they have access to
everyone's inventory.

Do NOT skip by a junk yard because it looks closed, or small.  One yard,
8 miles from me, has only 100 feet of frontage, but goes back quite a
ways.  I asked if they had any VW buses, and they had SIX!!! I got my
clock from one camper that came in within the previous week.  Two weeks
later, it was 'cherry picked'

Better than junk yards are VW repair shops.  Stop in ANY US city, call
each of the VW repair shops, and you will be sure to find over 20 buses
or campers in their back lots.  Yes, this is a better place than any US
junkyard!!  Call, and ask them if they know of any places with busses or
campers.  You will be plesantly surprised.

In all cases, junk yard or VW repair shops, do not show up there in the
last hour that they are open.  You will be too late to make a good
impression, and the you will pay inflated prices for anything you want. 
(Of course, if it is something that you NEED to get back on the road
because you are broke down, these places will bend over backwards to
help out. Seriously)

Do not be afraid of the junk yard dogs.  They do not bite until quiting
time.  Ignore them, but do not step on them if they are laying down in
the office.  Do not walk around them; they will move aside.  Ignore
them.  However, if you see any junk yard dogs in a pen, or tied up to a
shed, be sure you are out of there BEFORE closing.  The dogs are usually
not fed by the owners until the morning.

I have seen the yards come down in price, on some occasions.  But don't
expect to bargin.  It is best to get a price for an item BEFORE you pull
it off, unless you are a regular.

OK, and welcome to one of the finest relaxation hobbies in America, junk
yard (not 'flea market') shopping!!  (And remember to shut the door
behind you when you enter the office, and DO NOT smoke inside.  'Sir'
goes a long way, too!!))
