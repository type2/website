Subject: FS:  '71 Westfalia Camper

A friend of mine is selling his '71 Westy.  It is in very good condition.
        - 20k miles on completely rebuilt motor
        - 1600 dual port, upgraded to 88mm pistons (increased horsepower)
        - New clutch, brakes all around, generator, ball joints
        - Interior in good condition.  Brand new poptop canvas.
        - Body nice.  Red.  Some rust on inside of rocker panel, but not        
          noticable from outside.
        - About the only thing this camper needs is a rear bumper.
He is asking $2500/best offer.  Phone him directly at (215) 234-8687, or 
email to me and I'll pass it on to him.  He does not have email.
- -Ron Salmon
