&gt;difficult.  Do I need to remove the flywheel for any reason before I split
&gt;the case.
&gt;
&gt;Only if you want to get the case apart!....there are fasteners back
there..and
&gt;do not forget the one buried between the lifter bores on the driver's (?)


Also the one under the oil filter area, also by the lifters.  YOU NEED TO
REMOVE UP TO 18, count them 8mm nuts or bolts (often 17 but occasionally one
will be in place at the very top tab on the flywheel end) 2 6mm nuts from
the breather area, and 6 10mm case through bolts to split a T4 case, as
mentioned don't actually remove those 10mm bolts just take off the nuts.
Count them, if you don't have 18 yet, keep looking.  The 3 to get though are
1 behind the flywheel, 1 in the center of the lifter bores, and 1 below the
oil filter.  Then the T4 is still often a hard case to split, last week I
ruined a nice 1700 case, broke the tang up at the breather clean off on my
second tap with a wooden mallet, although I've hit harder on others with
even steel hammers so I figure someone else had already nearly broken it, so
I suggest the following as well.  It is usually the 2 dowels that hang it
up, particularly if they are rusted any.  To make it easier I rec using one
of the studs below the oil pump (which you had to of course remove as well,
though sometimes easier to first remove all the parting line and through
hardware then the pump will slip right out) to tap on, put an old nut on it
about halfway on, and tap gently with a hammer on the nut, this will
concentrate the force right at the dowel there below the pump, once that
starts judicious tapping with soft mallets up on the front top (flywheel
end) will usually break the other pin free and then you can pull it apart by
hand.  Also FWIW, no need to remove the oil seals.  Don't beat that stud so
much to damage it, light tapping will get the case going.
