&gt; What is hanging off of the cabinet on my '69 Westy?

&gt; It looks like a bag. It has gold snaps that match the curtain straps, which
&gt; leads me to believe it is original. I was thinking maybe for the side tent
&gt; or something?

Rob, I do not know, but I do know my '73 had something very similar tucked
up over that same cabinet.  I always figured it was related to the
hammock, but have no idea what it could be.
