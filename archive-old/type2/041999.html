I seem to have lost the number but their address is:

10328 Oakwood Dr
Dallas, TX 75217

I think they charge around $125 to rebuild your booster.  They ship it back
COD.  HOWEVER,
www_dot_carparts_dot_com has already rebuilt ones for about the same price if you
need one quick.  They didn't have them listed on their online search engine
but you can talk to one of their reps and they will look it up for you.

&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have the number for H&amp;R Boosters in Dallas?  I need to get a
new
&gt; booster asap.  Anyone know of anybody that might sell them locally?
