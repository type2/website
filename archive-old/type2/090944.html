Subject: Re: [T2] Sudden infatuation!!!

i thought this was what i had seen around town (i have seen 2-3 different

chris, the girlie one

 
... I'm lovestruck, folks.. I feel a new addiction coming on.
&gt; I just looked up one site on the Mercedes Pinzgauer / Unimog line of 
&gt; military
&gt; vehicles used in Germany, Belgium and? (I noticed one is painted UN 
&gt; blue!)..
&gt; Check out this one.. and yes, their electrical systems are 24V.
