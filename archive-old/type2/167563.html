Subject: Bribery??!!

I think I need another set of fresh eyeballs looking at my 78 2liter
engine.  anyone want to come to Baltimore tommorrow and stare at this
thing with me, !!  your favorite beverage, food, spare brain box for your
bus!?!  I'm getting pretty desperate, if nothing else need to stare at a
working bus just to get my perspective back, everything looks wrong about
now...

meekly crying help!!
