Subject: vanagon wt.

Listees:
In my ongoing bus hunt, may I ask another question, pls?

'79 Bay vs. 80 vanagon:
Theoretically, the vanagon handles better, has more room (and from what
i've seen--less rust). But weighs more.

How much do these models (non-westy) weigh restpectively?  (I've searched
the net, but can't find that data.)
And is that enough to trash trannies?

TNX 4 ur patience.
Gw
