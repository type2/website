Subject: Wurth site and catalog

Karl referenced the Wurth site.  Wow, there's a storehouse of good parts 
there.  I could not see how to order other than calling them up.

Anyone with experience on ordering? Is it wholesale only?  Do they have 
retail stores or?  I am in Canada so it may be more complicated.

In particular I saw ceramic type fuses in other than 8/16/25 amp 
denominations. I could use some 5 amp ones for my megasquirt application.
