Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield replacement in N. Virginia

I certainly would if I still lived there! (Vienna), but. I don't. However,
the job is fairly simple, just remember not to &quot;FORCE&quot; anything. I tried to
wrestle the original windshield back in (after it was repainted) and I
cracked it. It seems the toughest part is in the center. Rather than move
from one side to the other (like from left to right) I would suggest that
you attach the rubber gasket at the bottom first. You can simply sit the
windshield down (standing verticle) and work the gasket into the groove.
Then slowly work the windshield on the left and right up the sides
(equally).

When you get to the top, start in the middle and then work out to the sides.

I suggest using some string, as well as plastic hooks. Oh.. you'll also want
to use plenty of lubricant.. I suggest soapy water. I don't know what PB
Blaster or Armor all would have as a long term effect on the paint under the
gasket.

&gt; Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I broke my windshield and will be installing a replacement tomorrow here
&gt; in Alexandria, Virginia.  If anyone in/near Alexandria is interested in
&gt; watching/helping, they would be welcome!  E-mail me for directions to my
&gt; place.  I am thinkng this will happen at ~ noon and will take about an
&gt; hour.
