Subject: sick of points

I was driving around and my car was running like crap.  Turned out that
my points came totally loose.

So, now I'm looking at getting either pertronix or compu-fire.  I'm
looking at getting a Compu-Fire unit, and I'm just curious if it still
requires filing the bottom of the rotor?  I also read that the pertronix
isn't as durable.  It seems like both the the Compu-fire and the
Pertronix have their little quirks so I don't know which one to pick.  I
like the compufire design... hmmm... any thoughts?

Thanks,
Mike
