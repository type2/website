&gt;   What is different about the intake manifold for a bus?

Well, the part number starts with a 2 instead of a 1 ;-)

71 bus engines are a little strange and have a few one year only parts.  
The generator, gen stand, pulley, front engine tin, intake manifold (end 
castings at least),,,,not sure about the actual manifold, and some other 
little pieces are kind of hard to find.  I also have a 71 bus, she was 
my first bus, and my first car.
Does anyone have the late 71 model with the connector for the (Sun?) 
computer doodad to hook up to the engine?  I believe it is located in 
the upper passengers side of the engine compartment or something like 
that.  I have yet to see one.  I believe it would tell timing, dwell, or 
something like that.  Better yet, anyone have the gadget to hook up to 
it with?  Now *that* would be cool.  Or if anyone had a whole setup that 
functioned.

Isaiah
