I'm trying to resurrect a '80 Calif. Vanagon... she starts ok on the first
or second try, but won't idle at all.  I have to keep the gas pedal down to
keep running.  If I let up on the gas, the van stalls &amp; won't start again
for a few hours.  There is a gas smell when this happens.  Warming up the
van doesn't seem to cure these problems.  So far I've checked temp sensor 2
and the intake air sensor.  Where else should I concentrate my efforts?
Checking for vacuum leaks is difficult because I can't get the van to idle.

Also, I'm pretty sure the van is a California model (same dizzy as my '81
Calif. and has an O2 sensor) but the ignition coil appears to be from a
Federal model.  There is a Hall control unit, but no idle stabilizer.
Anyone seen anything like this?  I assume I should time the engine (once
its running) according to the type of dizzy (5 deg ATDC for the Calif.
2.0l), but the Bentley procedure says to connect the terminals from the
idle stabilizer together while setting the timing.  How would this
procedure change with the setup I have?  Thanks much for the help!!
