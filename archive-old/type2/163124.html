Subject: Fwd: [T2] Heat

OK, I'll get with the distributor. You guys look the website over real
good. Looks like the heaters that will work are the Airtronic D2 and
D4.
Controllers are also necessary. The best way to look at their features
in in this brochure

The minimalist control is the mini controller, but for you guys that
live where it's really cold you might want one of the radio remote
control units so you can preheat the van without going outside.
I haven't inquired into price yet, but I wouldn't be suprised if this
all ends up costing more than a grand.

Who on the list would be interested in a group purchase if I
&gt; can get him to import some of the &quot;petrol&quot; models?
