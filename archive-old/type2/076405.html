&gt; &gt; Truth be told, I've been operating without either
&gt; the bolt or the 
&gt; plate
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; everything is just fine.  The tire does not wiggle
&gt; around, make 
&gt; noise, or
&gt; &gt; pose any threat of escaping.  And with the plastic
&gt; cover in place, 
&gt; who
&gt; will
&gt; &gt; ever know?
&gt; 
&gt; mine wiggled and made noise, even WITH the strap in
&gt; place ('77 model). so i put it up on the nose, 1 so it
&gt; wouldnt wiggle and, 2 to cover up that nasty deer
&gt; dent.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;First time you hit something and the unsecured spare
&gt; flies forward, 
&gt; crushing
&gt; &gt;your head or that of one of your family
&gt; members/passengers, you'll 
&gt; know.
&gt; 
&gt; well, i can vouch for that, as i rolled my bus over
&gt; just the other day. altough the spare didnt fly up and
&gt; hit me (it was mounted on the front), EVERYTHING ELSE
&gt; in the bus came up and hit me on the head on it way
&gt; out the windshield hole. stuff like camping equipment
&gt; (tent poles) and stereo equipment (2x10 speaker box +
&gt; 2 amps) and various other misc. i have multiple cuts
&gt; and bruises on my noggin, and i must have been knocked
&gt; out for at least 30-45 minutes from what i can
&gt; recollect, cuz all i remember is going off the road
&gt; toward some trees, then waking up.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Maybe more likely in a rollover, but still...I'd want
&gt; it secured. 
&gt; 
&gt; try VERY likely in a rollover. there was more stuff
&gt; around my bus than still in it after the wreck.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It's 
&gt; not
&gt; like no one's ever rolled a Bus before (John Anderson,
&gt; looking in your
&gt; direction). :-)
&gt; 
&gt; or me. this happened when i was coming home from a
&gt; party on xmas eve. you can see how merry my xmas has
&gt; been. i drove 20 miles before I wrecked within 2 miles
&gt; of my house.
&gt; 
&gt; DONT DRINK AND DRIVE!!  EVER!!   ask me how i know.
&gt; 
&gt; the bus is totaled. i had it towed to my house where i
&gt; am basically stripping everything that's still good.
&gt; these items will be for sale, so email me with what
&gt; you need. i will be putting up a website soon with
&gt; parts available and asking prices. have to pay the
&gt; lawyer somehow. sorry the engine is not available, it
&gt; will be going into my bug so i might still have
&gt; transportation.
&gt; 
&gt; and i had just done a whole bunch of work to it. d*mn.
&gt; 
&gt; glad i was wearing my seatbelt. i was extremely lucky
&gt; to walk away with only cuts and bruises. if i had had
&gt; a passenger they probably would not have survived.
&gt; (just wait for the pictures)
&gt; 
&gt; counting my blessings,
