Subject: installed bap engine wont run

--part1_12d.12a580ce.2a3b6581_boundary

just installed our new bap 1600 in our bus. went to start it and it turns 
over, thre is gas going through the filter but wont start. Had a few flames 
shoot out the exhaust but that is it. When i installed the dist. they said 
the engine was set at tdc#1, but the rotor was pointing about 180' away from 
the #1 mark which is at about 5-6oclock pointing directly at me should the 
dist. be turned so the mark at about 12-1oclock, or is the engine not set 
right. Thanks
