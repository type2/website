Subject: Re: [T2] convert automatic to standard.

Hi Jack,

It's not very feasible, but there are some who have done it...

None of the linkages from the auto tranny are there, and neither are 
the holes they pass through or the mounting points they bolt to. You 
will need a complete manual drive train from axles to shifter and there 
will be a lot of fabricating and modification to figure out.

It would be easier in the long run to swap the engine and interior from 
the auto-tranny bus to the manual-tranny donor vehicle.

Which begs the question: What's wrong with the auto transmission?

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
