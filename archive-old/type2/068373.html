&gt; Subject: ID My '68 Bus.....Please...?

&gt; I wonder if anyone out there can help me to ID my bus, whose
&gt; details are as follows;

&gt; VIN                   : 228084614
                            ^
This makes is a '68 model. the 84,614th '68 to be exact.

&gt; I'd like (obviously) to get as much info. as possible.  I am
&gt; pretty sure that it's a '68 bus, but Bentley and Muir are
&gt; confusing me.  I think from Muir that it was built in December
&gt; '67 - which would make it a '67 bus...no?

The December '67 dated confirms a '68 because the model year
changes began in August '67 for the '68 model.

I don't have Bentley for bay window buses.  Actually, I don't
have one for Splits either, but I do have the VW Workshop Manual
and it shows the difference between the US and non-US models.
Please pardon my offlist gaff which &quot;suggested&quot; you may have a
non-US model, since you are in a non-US country (after that
little skirmish a couple hundred years ago).  I'm gathering that
Bentley produced its book primarily for the US market and did not
include Euro or UK models.

Other than &quot;electrical problems&quot; can you be more specific about
what doesn't work?  If it's just a couple of things I can help
with long distance diagnosis.
