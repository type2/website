Subject: Headlamp dimming-relay: NO FLASHER in USA &amp; Canada !

From: Nigel A. Skeet
To: VW Type 2 Listees

Dear USA and Canadian Listees.

Browsing recently through the electrical circuit diagrams, in my Robert 
Bentley and Haynes manuals for the 1968~79 VW Type 2 and 1968~75 VW Type 4, 
I noticed that the headlamp dimming-relay for the USA (and also Canadian 
presumably) specification vehicles, only has 4 terminals.

In Great Britain and Europe, the headlamp dimmer-relay has an extra terminal 
labelled 30, which is connected by a 2.5 mm2 cable, to an unfused battery 
supply (same fusebox terminal as the red/white 6.0 mm2 cable from the 
battery).

This enables we British to flash our headlamps, without first turning on the 
headlamps, at the main dashboard lighting switch!

Formally, flashing headlamps has the same meaning as sounding the horn; 
warning people of one's presence. Informally, it is used to acknowledge a 
courtesy from other drivers and lorry drivers commonly flash their headlamps 
to say it's okay to pull in front of them, following an overtaking 
manouevre. Owners of air-cooled VWs, also do it in greeting to one another, 
in Great Britain!

I discovered this difference, whilst sorting out a revised headlamp circuit, 
for a fellow VW Type 2 listee, in California, USA. I devised the circuit 
sometime ago, to enable the use of H4 100/55W, 100/80W, 130/90W or 160/100W 
quartz halogen headlamp bulbs (both p43t and P45t flanges), on my British 
specification 1973 VW 1600 Type 2, without suffering excessive voltage 
losses or overloading the standard wiring cables, ignition switch, dashboard 
lighting switch or headlamp dimming-relay.

The British &amp; European specification, 5-terminal headlamp dimmer-relay, used 
for 1971~79 VW Type 2, post-1967 VW Type 1 and post-1970 VW Types 3 &amp; 4, has 
VW Part No. 411 941 583B.

I have a few spares, if anyone wants to trade for some USA specification, 
featherweight second-hand, air-cooled VW components, which I seek for my 
1973 Westfalia Continental.

Regards.

         Nigel A. Skeet
