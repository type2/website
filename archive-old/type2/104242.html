Subject: RE: [T2] friday content:  Duct Tape

Ted,

I was afraid of that...It's just that we have had 
19&quot; of show *in February* and our normal is 2.7&quot; here
in Northwest Arkansas.  Shoot, when it finally got up to
32 degrees 4 days ago, people thought we were having
a heat wave and started wearing t-shits&lt;grin&gt;.

This is our first sunshine and &quot;normal&quot; temperature
in what seems like 3 weeks and I gotta tell ya, that
it is long overdue for us.

Your time *will* come.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Have a great weekend guys,
