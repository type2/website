i have some rust
i have some bondo
i have access to a high speed grinder
i can buy primer...

questions:
if i'm not concerned with the fact that the body damage = dents and stuff
can i scrape/grind/sand the bondo and funky paint spots off along with the
rust [if possible] and primer those areas?
will preparing small/medium areas of my bus's body regardless of actual
body damage prevent any rust that is occuring between the cracks of the
horrible bondo job?  will simply painting over rust provide some prevention
for the spread of the cancer?  what grit paper is reccomended for getting
down to the nittygritty with the existing bondo/paint/rust...

i'm not looking for a quick fix... ok, maybe i am.. but only to avoid
further spreading of the rust under the crappy coverup that's there.
i'd rather cover it up well and have dents showing than have cracking bondo
with rust going rampant under/between it.

so it'll be blue with gray clouds...
