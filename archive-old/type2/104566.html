&gt; &gt; It also allows you to use an
&gt; &gt; uninterrupted metal line from the firewall to the fuel pump.
&gt;
&gt;Um... there's supposed to be a _metal_ line between the firewall (concealing
&gt;the fuel tank) and the fuel pump?

Originally, yeah.  Now I'm talking type1 here.  I don't know anything about 
the type4 engines.
I was responding to a guy with a '71.  Your late loaf would have had 
something else going on,
I'm sure.

The metal fuel line went through the grommet in the firewall, and a couple 
of inches on the far side,
connected to the rubber hose that went to the tap on the fuel tank.  Inside 
the engine compartment,
it went over the top of the spark plug connector boots, did a 90 deg. bend, 
and headed over to
the fuel pump, where it screwed into the 211-127-025 fuel pump, using a 
111-127-531A fuel line farel
and a 111-127-541A fuel line nut.  This is the setup I use in all my 
ACVWs.  The later pump
dispensed with the farel and nut, by using a push-on connector attached to 
the metal fuel line
with a short length of rubber hose.

Every time I go to a VW show, there's at least a couple of folks with 
buckets full of these pumps
for five bucks each.  Wolfsburg West carries rebuild kits for twelve 
bucks.  Beats the [dickens]
out of buying those cheap-o, throw away pumps--like I used to.
