&gt;Hey Everyone,
&gt;This weekend we were camping in the local San Diego mountains and 
&gt;experienced a new problem with the '70 Westy.  When coming down the 
&gt;mountain ,or on fast deceleration, the engine lets out a real loud 
&gt;backfire... POP!
============================&gt;
My '70 is doing the same thing, but not a singular big time POW;
more like a series of smaller, quite subdued backfires in a continual 
string.
(Almost can't hear them way up in the driver's seat)
Occurs when I stay in 2nd or 3rd gear so as to slow down the coast 
speed a'comin' down mountains,
and during fast decelerations.
BTW, Those are some super fine Westies shown on Tom's home page... WOW !
