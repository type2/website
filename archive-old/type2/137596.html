&gt;How come you couldn't import one and update it.
&gt;I knew a guy a few years ago who imported a Mercedes 280 SL from Germany
&gt;and had to change the lights and a few other things but he could do it
&gt;and with the exchange rate at the time came out a little ahead.

And if I read the Brazilian web site correctly, you can pick up one of 
these new buses for about $12,500 USD.
