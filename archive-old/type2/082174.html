Tony---

You must be a very wealthy  type of guy---

A lift ain't cheap----

A pit has it's limitations----

But would e a good deal for working on the bottom of anything, where the
vehicle didn't have to be off the ground---

Think about undercoating for instance----


Later,


Terry

&lt;&lt; build it into the side of a hillside or other location where it is a

designed such a &quot;pit&quot; but didn't buy the house that would have made it
easy... 
Second thoughts on a &quot;pit&quot;: If you're working on VW's primarily, drop-
ping the engine would be at least as difficult as on level ground. You'd
only have a hole slightly less in width as the inner wheel spacing and a
transmission-type jack would be required to let it down. Then move the
bus to get it out of the pit...repair the engine...load it back on the
jack...drop it into the pit...roll the bus back over the pit...lift and
install engine...Nah...Not worth the effort to put the pit in. Save that
money and put it towards an electric lift...
