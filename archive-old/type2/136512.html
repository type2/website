&gt; what's the deal with Bentley recommending to leave out the dished washers on

&gt; be very tight still.

Apparently, the snap rings tended to pop out if the spring washer was
used, so they deleted the washer.  If you're pulling the CV then leave the
washer out, but I wouldn't pull the CV just to take the washer out.  After
all, it's been secure in there for a very long time!

Remember that you only have to remove one CV to replace both
boots.  If one boot is more torn than the other remove that CV so that you
can clean it more completely.  If the boot isn't torn, then all you have
to do is wipe up the grease with clean paper towels and repack the CV.
