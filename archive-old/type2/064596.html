Subject: Question about water tank lock

The lock was missing on the fresh water tank of our Westy when we
bought it, but the PO found the lock and brought it to us yesterday.
He never had a key from the owner before him so I am wondering how
I should go about getting a key.  

Do the VW dealerships have keys?  Is it expensive to have a 
locksmith make a key from the lock?  Can I get one of you to make
a copy of yours and will it fit? 

Surely some of you have had to deal with this problem.  I don't think
anyone would be mean enough to sabatoge my water reservoir but
we will be traveling into &quot;uncharted&quot; regions and you never know!

Thanks,
Juli Martin
