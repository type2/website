&gt; The EGR light on my 1978 Westy has just come on at 104,000 miles. 
What does it mean?  What must I do to get it to turn off?

It means that it is time to service the EGR valve/filter.  The light
can be turned off by pushing a button on the back of the speedometer
(as I remember, mine doesn't have this feature)
