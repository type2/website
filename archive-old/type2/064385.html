Subject: Heat Exchangers

There have been some pretty exotic ideas passed around about how to 
preserve heat exchangers.

I live in Canada where we get our share of cold and wet.

I found some pretty rusted exchangers a couple years ago,
cleaned them off with a wire brush, and used a brush to paint them
with a good rust inhibitor paint.  I gave them several really thick
coats before installing them.   

I found that the exchangers didn't get so hot that normal rust paint
came off and they still look really great.

ttys,
...Markus
