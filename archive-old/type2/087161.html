Subject: Re: [T2] Woe is me.


I have been watching this thread for several posts...and now have to jump=
=20
in.

I had one of these, yes I used two synchronizers...about 20 years ago.

I rebuilt the engine and carbs on my 72 and thought they worked=20
great....plenty of power(relative to the 67 I had before)...great brakes.
Compared to some of the Kadrons linkage setups, they vw linkage on that
engine was perfect...infinitley adjustable and it stayed where you put it.


Did 90+ mph on the istate on one of those unbelievable no cars anywhere
Saturday mornings where you can see for about 10 miles.  Never did it=20
again, but *never* had any trouble keeping up with any traffic....this was=
=20
not a camper.

I can't remember ever having to touch the carbs again...and I probably put=
=20
60k on that engine...got great 22mpg+ on the hiway(no head wind).


Rebuild/rebush them, make sure they are installed as the factory would,=20
synchronize them according to the bentley and drive on!

Cheers, dave

&gt; My 7 seater is  72.  Working on the engine is, what is the term? oh yes,
&gt; fun, like the games Twister is fun.  I have often found myself almost
&gt; completely inside the engine compartment for certain procedures.  But, it
&gt; really isn't that bad.  I agree with David that it is easier than most V8=
's
&gt; or FWD V6's to extract the spark plugs.  Everything is logical and
&gt; accessible and simple.

&gt; The carbs are easy to work on and once I got them dialed in, I have had v=

 If
&gt; you decide to replace your carbs, I will be interested in buying your old

&gt;=20
&gt; The 72 has a lot of 1 year only issues.  But there are many things I like=

&gt; Has anybody ever used 2 carburetor synchronizers simultaneously to sync t=

&gt; &gt; So I am happily shopping for stuff at my favorite local dealer today. I
&gt; &gt; picked up some door handles and other broken stuff for my new baby.  Wh=
en
&gt; &gt; the shop owner informs me that his mechanic refuses to work on my parti=
cular
&gt; &gt; year of westy.  And he proceeded to list the following &quot;known&quot; problems=
:
&gt; &gt;=20
&gt; &gt; 1. Throttle linkage wears out and creates a vaccuum leak on the dual ca=
rbs.
&gt; &gt;=20
&gt; &gt; 2. The engine is hard to access and therefore work on.
&gt; &gt;=20
&gt; &gt; His main bone of contention seemed to be the carb situation. He seems t=
o
&gt; &gt; dislike the dual carbs with a passion. Maybe they stomped on his flower=
 bed
&gt; &gt; in a previous life. But anyway, I am a little disheartened, how big of =
a
&gt; &gt; deal is this? Opinions ideas? :-(
&gt; &gt;=20
&gt; &gt; Question #2, exhaust leak near the head on the driver's side. It doesn=
=B9t
&gt; &gt; look like its the head itself so I suspect the heat exchanger is cracke=
d.
&gt; &gt; The question is, can this be done engine in the bus or do I need to yan=
k it.
&gt; &gt;=20
&gt; &gt; And an update:
&gt; &gt;=20
&gt; &gt; To those whose had suggestions for the shifter and no reverse, thank yo=
u!
&gt; &gt; The shifter plate was out of adjustment and now everything is hunky-dor=
y.
&gt; &gt;=20
&gt; &gt; Thanks.
