Subject: new 1776 rebuild running crappy

------=_NextPart_001_0002_01C1905C.92A96310

Volks, =20
I have a new rebuild here that i have put in my SC.  New wires, pertronix=
, plugs, etc.  Plugs are torqued in.  Timing set at 30 degrees total, wit=
h an 009 dizzy and dual kads.

Thing starts on about the 3rd turn of the key..............and stalls whe=
n I give pedal.  Does this 2 or 3 times and then runs and pops(sputters) =
a lot when i try to give it gas. It will warm up and smooth out, but I ha=
ve not road tested yet for fear of the worst.  I have done a few other re=
builds, and usually they run smooth right off the bat (more or less).  I =
know the carbs are good, for i had them recently on  a 1600..............=
I balanced them earlier in the week, But the readings on my synchrometer =
seemed a little high for 1000 rpms.

I have adjusted the valves, same result.
