Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Injection Parts Photos

Thanks for the pics. That helps out a lot. I am slowing learning all the
pieces that I am going to need to make this change happen.

Is their an alternative to using the CHT sensor that is threaded into the
head? I am assuming that this is an FI head part only and will not be on my
current 1973 setup. I thought FI was a bolt on replacement for a carb. Do I
need to get a different head, have machine work done to this one? I plan to
have a megasquirt setup, so I can adjust the output from this sensor, so maybe
I can use one like the CHT gauges use under the spark plug? What have others
done when upgrading from a carb to FI?

Thanks,
Corbett
