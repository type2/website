Most bizarre engine swap? Toyota v6 into a 67 Mustang. (Helped a
friend do it actually.) Amazingly, there was a kit out there for that
swap! I wonder how many Ford fans wanted to beat him up... LoL

Water to water aint that bizarre...The hardest part of a water
to AC VW is the radiator... Where do you plan on putting it?
And how do you plan to plumb it? 'Lectric water pumps...?-(
