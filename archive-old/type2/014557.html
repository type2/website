Dave wrote &lt;&lt;What store, and what application 
were the studs listed for ? How much longer ? Diameter of the bigger
section ? 
Dave&gt;&gt;
 
     I found them at a store called U-Joint a distributor for CarQuest
Auto parts. They were listed for a late model Chevy(part #610-327)(brand
name is DORMAN). The box says they are M14(diameter)-1.5(thread) x
45.4mm(long), I think someone said stock studs are 35mm long. The
diameter of the bigger section is unknown, by me, but it's not by much. 
     I talked to a machine shop and they are going to charge me only $40
to drill the hubs, and press the studs on. Not bad, at least I'll know
it's done right.

Thanks,
