Subject: Dispose of '79 and '69 type 2's

I have two Type 2s to dispose of.  I am really hoping that they dont have 
to be sent to the crusher graveyard.   One is a 1979 bus that I drove for a 
few years as the second owner. It was in good shape and ran well as my 
regular vehicle until parked outside in 1991. Has since gotten rusted spots 
on it. It could probably be restored, but it is certainly at least good for 
parts.

The second is a 1969 bus that has a conversion package (not a pop top) that 
included curtains, sink, cabinets, folding seat/bed, etc.   I had a brand 
new VW short block from Germany installed by a VW repair shop shortly before 
taking it off the road due to a rusted framework. The new shortblock had 
about 4000 miles on it and the bus was driven daily until I parked it 
permanently. I wouldnt consider this restorable, but Im sure there are 
many parts that would benefit someone else.

I specifically bought the 1979 because it was the latest year with the same 
body style as the 69. All these years Ive intended to move the camper 
stuff from the 69 to the 79, but it aint happened yet! Guess I have to 
face reality and realize Im never going to get to it; thus, maybe someone 
else can better utilize these vehicles.

These parts buses are in southeastern Massachusetts. If interested in more 
info, email to jpjerri_at_hotmail_dot_com
