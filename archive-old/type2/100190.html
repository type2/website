Subject: bum joints

BG-

(after your new engine and all this, aren't you ready to hit the road?)

I wouldn't expect to get much for your trades, but I wouldn't be too unhappy
getting out of there for $500 either.

A while back, I pulled the torsion arms on my '70 myself (2 hrs), bought the
joints at Bus Depot (4 x $17) and took them to a pro who set up the ball
joints for $100 which was very fair.  The pain is putting them back (2 hrs
of frustration).  I can see adding some time trying to get the sway bar
clamps off intact but I just cut them off and bought new ones.

Then again, I already had my brakes removed, so add another 2 hrs for front
brake R&amp;R, and another hour for adjustment and misc.

That adds up to about 7 hrs at $50 per hour is $350 plus $100 for pressing
in the joints.  Probably they don't give you the discounted parts so try
4x$25 total $550.  If they did other stuff they are probably thinking that
you are getting the deal.  Someone who knows what they are doing would take
about half that time (but still charge the book rate on all that.)  And
someone who knows what they are doing will align the joints right--someone
in N.Florida had a recent experience with mis-alignment. (or maybe thats
what took them so long)

IMHO, ballpark price for major shop work.  If I ever have to do it again I
will probably just buy the rebuilt arms from Bus Boys for about $180.

PS.  My Autozone &quot;Bosch&quot; recrap generator lasted 3 days.  Cost 3/4 of new
price, not counting the hassle.
