X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Greetings,
     I was checking out the engine that I pulled yesterday and discovered a
few things.  First, I have regular lifters, not the hydraulic lifters that I
thought I had.  Second, the EGR valve is not connected to the exhaust
system.  By looking at Figure 7-1 on page 32 of the Bentley (Fuel Injection
section), I see what I should have.  Well, I have the pipe running from the
intake of the air intake distributor to the EGR valve.  The EGR valve itself
which is attached to the Filter.  The bottom of the filter is missing (as
in, it looks like someone cut it out with a chisel).  There in not (or at
least none that I can see) place for the exit pipe of the filter to connect.
I guess this is good for me since I don't have an exit pipe on the bottom of
the filter.
     Can I remove the EGR valve, filter and connection pipe to the air
intake distributor?  I know that if I do, I will have to plug the hole where
the connection pipe hooked to the air distributor and patch the engine tin
where the EGR was mounted.  If  I remove the EGR valve, what do I do with
the wires that connected to it?  Should I just tape them up and tie them out
of the way, or cut the plug off the wiring harness?  Will leaving this plug
unconnected cause any problem with the &quot;brain&quot;.

Thanks,
Stuart
