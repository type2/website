Ken,

Before the king kong jokes start, &quot;faying&quot; is a semi-obsolete term that
died with the advent of fiberglass boats.  It refers to to painting
sealant (usually red lead suspended in turpentine) (gad, what an
environmentally sensitive, non-toxic substance that was!) between mating
surfaces. The places I remember were at the scarf joints on the wood keel
and along the top of the lead keel before pulling it up to the wooden
keel.

I would never have thought of using it inre VW engines but I assume he
means the edges of the case that seal one to the other.  BTW, I love the
re-incarnation, as it always disappoints me when a word disappears from
common use.
