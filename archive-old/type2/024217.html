Subject: Sloppy Shifting
To: Type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hiya All,

70 Bus.  The shifting action is very vague.  Not much resemblance to the old 
&quot;H&quot; pattern at all.  Sometimes an adventure just to find first gear.

Anyway, I'm under the Bus (doing a brake job right now) and there seems to be 
quite a bit of play in the shift rod.  Especially so at the point in front of 
the rod where the  rod rotates on the little plastic pivot.

Bentley says that you can't mess around with the shift rods without dropping 
the tranny.  But I seem to recall reading here on the list that it is 
possible to change out the forward shift bushing WITHOUT moving or removing 
the tranny.  If so, how does one go about that?  I'd really like to replace 
these parts under the shift lever and tighten up the action a bit.

Thanks!

Mike
