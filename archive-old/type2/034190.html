&gt; I'm no tranny expert, but far as i know, autos started in 73 in the bus. 
&gt; Early ones came with a vacuum module that is undesirable for some (buggy

&gt; bad, but shouldn't be a high-dollar item. Screw right into the outside of the
&gt; transmission and is easily accessible.

it isn't expensive, but try finding one!

&gt; A 70's VW auto in a bus should go 125 - 175k miles if serviced properly. 
&gt; Those are 'soft numbers', but I wouldn't want one (bus auto tranny) with more
&gt; than 150k on it.

284k on auto tranny(s)

&gt; I speculate further that the rebuild on one of these would be cheaper than on
&gt; a std tranny.

surely you jest!?!?!?    seems the most trouble prone part is the pump
