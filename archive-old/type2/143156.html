Subject: Another benefit to having working thermostat and flaps!

This morning was the first time I've driven the bus since installing the
thermostat and flaps. I must say that it warmed up MUCH quicker and idled
better when cold than it has since I got here in Colorado last Feb!

This is wonderful!

But.... Has anybody noticed the deep whooshing sound coming from the engine
when the flaps are closed? It goes away when the engine warms up...
