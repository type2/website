Subject: pistons, cylinders, and rings

     I've been trying to solve the 'lack of compression problem' on my 74
westy and I was wondering if someone could answer a few questions for me.
Three of the cylinders had zero compression and so I was guessing that I had
a burnt valve.  But with the heads off, my valves look great!  So I'm
wondering is there any way that I can check to see if my pistons,cylinders,
and rings are O.K. without having to pull the pistons out of the cylinders
or is that just wishful thinking.  My local mechanic friend says that I
should just pull the pistons out of the cylinders, put new rings on and put
everything back together; does that sound logical?
