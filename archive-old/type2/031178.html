&gt; It sounds like you are using Castro Syntec, is that
&gt; right?  I used it on my worn out first 2L and it

actually Pennzoil &quot;Performax&quot; 

&gt; (little VW type 4 joke).  Is there anything magical
&gt; about 3.3K for the synthetic switch?  I was wondering

I changed my oil after 
15 minutes
100 miles
200 additional miles
1,000 additional miles
2,000 additional miles

changed to synthetic
3,000 additional miles
4,000 additional miles
every 5,000 miles there after

so the total non synthetic miles were 3,300
basically the guy that rebuilt the bottom end says, wait at least 3,000
miles before switching to synthetic.  he recomended synthetic but I was
using it before anyway

&gt; if you should wait until compression hits as high a
&gt; pressure as it's going to, by recording compression
&gt; every 1K miles or so.

I didn't but might not be a bad idea

&gt; Who rebuilt your 2Ls low end, and how much did he

Bruce at RJ Loock in Baltimore.
(not the same Bruce as works on VW buses on Central Ave, I reccomend both)

&gt; charge you?

wasn't cheap but I provided most of the parts,  bottom line when done was
about $2,600.  but I did things that are not normally done too, including
1 gram balance of crank and rods and pistons.  balancing of rods.
honeing the oil pump 
cleaning the bore of the intake and exhaust ports. etc

&gt;  How do I get intouch with him?

you have to go to him, he doesn't do mail order. and he is a bit slow.
(took about 2 months for my engine)

&gt;  Your oil
&gt; pressure numbers are so impressive it might be worth
&gt; the trip.  I've got another block I might consider
&gt; getting rebuilt for later.  It doesn't sound like your
&gt; mechanic even bothers to check oil pressure after a
&gt; rebuild, which makes the high pressures even more
&gt; amazing.

nope he has never checked anything, finishes it up and hands it to me and
says &quot;I think you'll like it&quot;

I did.
he is a fanatic, likes to talk too!
