Subject: Re: [T2] good speaker for my Vanagon 83 wanted !!

&gt; I'd like to change my original speakers (front and back) by a good (not
&gt; too expensive) ones.
&gt; I would like to know if one of you guys have some nice experience with a
&gt; brand on a vanagon.
&gt; I am a jazz-rock musician (my music style is weather report , jaco
&gt; patorious , Stanley Clark , step ahead , .....) and would like a 4&quot;
&gt; speakers which could reproduce the bass sound nicely.
&gt; Thanks for any info.

Polk Audio makes some of the best (or if not THE best) combination tweeter,
midrange, bass units you can buy with a balanced price. I  don't see a 4&quot;
offered however.

http://www.crutchfield_dot_com only has one model of 4&quot; available an &quot;autobahn&quot;
brand 4&quot; speaker. But at 79.00 a piece...
