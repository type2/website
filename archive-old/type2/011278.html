Subject: Help stranded south of Provo

My wife just broke down south of provo. Can anyone suggest a good shop to 
have AAA tow our bus to? Phone number and address would be great! She just 
called AAA but we have no idea where to go. She said the lights started 
dimming then it quit. My guess is the Altrenator blew. Thanks!
