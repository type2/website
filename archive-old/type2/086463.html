Subject: exhaust leak

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C1EC8F.19F2B720

Well, I have spent the last week and a half listening to and learning the=
 sounds of my bus.
And I have realized two things.  The first is that I have an exhaust leak=
 on the drivers side.  The leak is coming from the front area of the heat=
er box, but I can't tell if it is the heater box or where it connects, or=
 what it connects to.  Is there anyway to tell where the leak is coming f=
rom without replacing all the parts.  I tried to run my hand over the are=
a to see where it is coming from, but I just felt heat and couldn't tell.
The second thing I realized is that I need to install a stereo.  I have a=
 stereo, but do not know where two of the wires connect.  One needs to be=
 connected to the power supply and one needs to be connected to the memor=
y B+.  I have a red wire coming out of the fuse box right above the numbe=
r 10 fuse.  Is this where I should connect the power?  Also, underneath t=
he dash there is a metal piece that runs from the emergency brake to the =
front of the body.  This piece bolts to the body.  And where it bolts the=
re is an electrical connector.  It is shaped like a c and slips around th=
e bolt.  It has a short length of black wire crimped on to it (the way yo=
u crimp wire to a push on connector).  The wire is only an inch long and =
must have been cut.  Does anyone know how to hook up a stereo, and/or wha=
t these wires are for?  Does anyone have any diagrams of how to do this? =
 =20
Also, anyone installed speakers in the rear of there westy without taking=
 up a lot of precious storage space?  Does anyone have pictures of this?
Thanks,
Peace,
Kyle
