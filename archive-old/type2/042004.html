Subject: RE: valve covers

Jason and List,

In response to:
&gt;I am not familiar with the rubber gaskets; are they a VW factory part?

	I've used both the cork and rubber valve cover gaskets and haven't
noticed a difference in their performance.  I agree with all the
suggestions that Roland gave you and they should eliminate your problem.
But if you are still having trouble with your valve cover leaking you may
want to try removing the bale wire that holds the cover on and then bend
the the ends toward each other.  This will increase the force with which it
holds the cover against the engine. Lastly, sometimes the covers can get
bent or warped so that they don't fit flush against the engine, in which
case you should buy new ones.  Luckily they are cheap.

Good luck,
