&gt; All,
&gt; Last weekend I came upon a VW shop w/hundreds of old Vdubs sitting around
&amp;
&gt; a big &quot;commercial property for sale&quot; sign out front. I wandered through
the
&gt; yard, taking pictures. Looking at the pictures I can count 30 type IIs,
from
&gt; splits to vanagons, 14 of them campers. The building is a huge rambling
&gt; affair, just chock full of partially finished  Vdubs &amp; parts, mostly used.
&gt; I don't know what will happen to all this stuff when the property is sold,
&gt; but I have a bad feeling the crusher is waiting.
&gt; I have no connection to the place, I'm just a gear-head Vdub fan passing
on
&gt; the info to anyone who might need parts or a project, while they are still
&gt; there.
