Subject: [T2] 68/69/70 Front Beam Q.

My bus was manufactured on the 12th August 1969, (VIN: 220 2007 404).
I.e.: drums all-round, 205mm 5 stud wheels, curvy rear vents, etc)


Q1: Does this make it a 70 or 69??

 and

Q2: How do I determine if I have the later style front beam or the earlier
one??


TIA,
