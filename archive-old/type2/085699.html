Subject: Body restoration Tech and Tips Web Site?

hey all,

I'm Currently in the process of soaking up all the Information I can about 
replacing the obvious Panels in my '77 (Windshield, Door Pillars, jacking 
points, etc.) but I have never operated a MIG welder in my life... I was 
just wondering if there were any websites on VW Bus Repair with informative 
pictures to reassure me that it can be done and that I'm not in over my 
head...

Thanks a bunch.
