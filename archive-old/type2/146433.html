Subject: Re: [T2] Why not to live in pretentious neighborhoods

&lt;It seems as though the third house
I've parked in front of didn't like that I blocked the
Friday morning street sweeping.  In script
I wrote a friendly note on the back of my neighbor's
note explaining the painting work and how it won't last
but one more week.  I also offered to sweep the street
in front of their property w/my phone number.&gt;


C;mon guys!!! Quit it!!! You're going to ruin our &quot;good for nothing&quot; reputation!!!! 

&lt;grin!&gt;
