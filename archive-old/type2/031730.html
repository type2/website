&gt; there is a dremel tool in the house for those rusted bolts!  i bought all 
&gt; new triangular gaskets for the exhaust, bolts and nuts.  i also have 4 new 
&gt; exhaust manifold gaskets.
&gt; 
&gt; any tips on putting all of this back together?  anything i should do in 

I have found that put the exhaust to head pipes on as early as you
can. but don't pull em down real tight. (snug but not torqued)

then put it all together loosely.  (seems nothing ever quite lines
up) then when all the pieces are together and look like they are square
etc then tighten all the bolts/studs etc

&gt; gaskets on BEFORE i install the engine?  i also bought a new foam engine 
&gt; seal (thanks mice!)  at what stage should i put this on, before or after 
&gt; the engine is in the compartment?

I always put the foam in dead last, after the engine has been started,
initial tune up everything... the foam is a royal PITA to get in and gets
in the way while doing some of the other installation jobs and I always
seem to manage to tear it taking it out so this lowers the risk of damage
to it.

&gt; also, what tools/cleaners has anyone used to clean the engine?  the shop 

people clean engines??????   ;8*?

Have a good trip
