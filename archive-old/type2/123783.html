Subject: RE: [T2] Storage/Prep Oil Question

Part manufacturers have some sort of spray grease they put on their
parts to prevent them from corroding while in storage.  Find the
thickest oil or spray grease you can and give it a good dousing.  White
lithium grease is the easiest product to find that will adhere to parts
and not drip away.  Also put the engine in a big garbage bag and tie the
opening off.  This should help to prevent any condensation, dust or
rodents from getting into it.

Subject: [T2] Storage/Prep Oil Question

Senario: Damp basement, freshly cleaned and degreased short block '73
1700 
type IV. I want to oil the crank, bearings, camsfaft, whatnots, etc. Oil

pump, screen, drain plug, cooler all removed. I watched the priming
thread 
the other day and it got me to thinking.

Question: Besides using my oil can suirter to hit the visible parts,
what 
would be a good way to get the oil to the bearings and such?
Could I suirt oil in through some other orifaces and turn the engine
over to 
get it all dispersed to the areas I can't see?

Right now there is PB Blaster on most of it just to keep the moisture in
the 
air from getting to the unprotected surfaces. But I would like to get
some 
real lubrication in there before building up the rest of the engine. I
am 
imagining something more like an assembly lube or thick oil additive.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
