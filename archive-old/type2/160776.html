Subject: Re: [T2] Driving home from EveryBus at 3,600 MPH!!!

An entertaining trip, thanks. You're right about the stopover, the 
movie lost 'something' after dark.
I'm not sure where EveryBus was but spring had arrived wherever that 
was and on the trip north there were places you could spring hadn't 
made it that far yet.
The other thing I noticed was that you were in a VW bus, everyone was 
passing you &lt;g&gt;.
Thanks for thinking of us, I enjoyed the daylight part.

&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt;What I have for your viewing pleasure is a stop-motion video I made
&gt;using an Apple iSight video camera positioned on the dash of my bus.
&gt;The camera was set up to take 30 frames per minute, and playback is
&gt;set for 30 frames per second. So the video shows the bus heading home
&gt;along the interstate at up to 4000 miles per hour (a little slower on
&gt;the hills, but still respectable at 3000MPH.
