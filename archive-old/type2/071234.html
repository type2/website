&lt;&lt; I believe to use a cat on your bus it would be necessary to obtain and fit 
a
 late FI system which includes a lambda sensor. &gt;&gt;

My bus is a 79 &quot;federal emissions&quot; model with a catalytic converter.  It did 
not have an oxygen sensor when I got it.  Was it just &quot;CA emissions&quot; versions 
that did, or did my bus also have one originally?
