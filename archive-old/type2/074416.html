Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Bilge Blowers

Years ago I bought the dual fan and recirculation
deal from Barney's.  I wasn't impressed with the
kit.  Buy your own stuff and view Bulleys &quot;heat,
noise and rust in a vw&quot; website.  You'll do just
as well.  

The problem with that remote oil cooler heater
deal is that you don't want your oil any cooler
on the days you want heat...
