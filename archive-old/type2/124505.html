Subject: RE: [T2] Floppy vent wing- how to tighten? - also in bad haiku

It's the front door, drivers window. I'll play around in there later,
there's no desire to pull the door panel right now. I'll do it in the
fall when I wax the inside of the doors.
Thanks again Karl!

From Al:
 Vent window flop in wind.
 Want to tighten top pivot.
 How will I do this?
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Since you mention the top pivot, 
which is a rivet, I am assuming you are
referring to the front door vent windows?

If yes, remove the door panel and tighten the lower clamp bolt on the
pivot shaft. But make sure the pivot shaft is still attached to the
bottom of the vent window 1st.....  A lot of times, the clamp 
and shaft rust together and when the window is opened, the shaft shears
off. You can watch the shaft turn thru the same hole in the door where
you see 
the 10mm clamp bolt.

The rear vent windows suffer the sheared shaft fate about 50% of the
time.
