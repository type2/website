Subject: Fluff and monkeys

 Man . .  the &quot;hairless monkey&quot;. . . . consults his charts and maps.

 Casts his religious and political bones. Grunts and squeaks and calls 
it &quot;Science&quot; if he can get 2 other monkeys to agree on a regular basis. 
 
 Scientific &quot;data&quot; if he doesn't have to throw out more than half the results.

 Makes his little evenly spaced marks on paper and then declares it 
a law of &quot;Nature&quot; or whatever. The &quot;when&quot;, &quot;where&quot; and &quot;what&quot; of it
all. 
 
 Writes on both sides of the paper and has it carefully bound and 
covered in the hide of an animal.

 Only those &quot;Chosen Few&quot; who have been &quot;properly&quot; indoctrinated
may have access. 

 Caesar wants 31 days in July well change the damn calendar.
 Let's not forget &quot;Augustus&quot; either. 

 Autumn is defined as &quot;Fall&quot; or the &quot;autumnal eqinox&quot;, September 22.

 But today - November 3, when the fog lifted from the valley, the signal
flags were flying from every mast in the forest and glen.

 The Alder, Aspen, Maples, Madrones, Oaks, and 1823 other deciduous 
trees and bushes in their yellows, reds, purples and browns against
the back-drop of a dozen shades of greens and blues.

 Today is &quot;Autumn&quot; in Grants Pass.  
 
 I haven't described this scene very well and I regret that.

 &quot;You had to have been there&quot;.
 
 &quot;Hail Caesar!&quot;

 Went to town to get a &quot;used&quot; 3/8 drill and came home with a new .410
double-barrel shot-gun.  If I had a wife, she'd kill me.
