Subject: Help -- new carbs -&gt; engine won't start
Date: Fri, 26 Feb 1999 06:56:24 -0000

Clever people of the list, I am appealing for help on this one.  It has
got me stumped.

Last Tuesday night I put a new pair of carbs on the bus (stock Solex,
stock 2 litre CJ engine).  I took my time and made sure I did everything
right.  When I finished I started up the engine.  It ran fine, starting
as soon as the bowls filled up, didn't threaten to cut out or anything.
The idle was high but then these are brand new carbs and I don't know
how they set the screws in the factory.

Last night I went out again to set everything up, and it wouldn't start.
At all.  Not even the faintest hint of a sputter.  My battery is good,
there is 3/4 of a tank of fuel, I have a nice fat spark, I have air (the
intakes are still off the carbs).  What else do you need to start a
fire?  Even the weather was ideal and the bus was parked in the garage
the whole time.

If anyone can give me any ideas what might be going on, I would
appreciate it if you could let me know today.  I wanted to get it
running by the weekend.

Thanks very much.  You people are great.
