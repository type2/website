Subject: prototype VW

&gt; I worked at a VW-Audi dealership back in the late 60's, and one summer day
&gt; the owner handed me a car to test as 'maybe the replacement for the
&gt; beetle.' As I recall, it was black and small, about the size of a beetle,
&gt; boxy, conventional-looking, with a hood and trunk, like a Fiat only rear
&gt; engined. Maybe like a squared-off Renault Dauphine of that era. All I was
&gt; asked to do was drive the car for a day and report my impressions. At the
&gt; time, I was driving a 62 beetle.
Sounds like the Central American market Brasilia... looks like a chopped
off 411. Very common in May hee coh.
