Subject: mechanic in SF?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, it's come to this:  anyone know of a mechanic in the SF bay area,
preferrably as close to Ocean Beach (where my '80 vanagon is broken down)
as possible? She seems to need some clutch work, way beyond me.  I figure
as long as she's in there I'll do the lazy thing and have them tune her up.
 Any recommendations? Any experiences with Bay Area VW mechanics invited.

Thanks a lot.
