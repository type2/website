I am going to try to be there. I'm also in a '79 that is a strange mix of
white, gray and orange with a splash of rust here and there.
The PO painted over the liscense plate light and that didn't go over well in
the safety inspection (that and the rusted/welded front axle beam).

&gt; Hay!
&gt;      I heard about a swap meet in Ogden, Utah, this saturday, the 29th.
&gt; At Bug Craft, is any other list members going? I'm planning on going,
&gt; but depends on the weather. If so I will be driving my 79' bus, White,
&gt; with a black bra, and a brown engine lid.
&gt; Thanks
