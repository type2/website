Subject: [T2] New Mexican Case and Hydraulics

Volks;

The thread on rebuild or new got me to thinking, which is ALWAYS
dangerous.

I have one of the new mexican 1600 DP cases.  I recently (2-3 months
ago) saw an article in H*t VW's or something about installing hydraulic
lifters in this case.  It seems the lifter bores are thicker to permit
machining.  Does anyone know what machining would be involved?  Do the
new Mexican cases use Type 4 hydraulic lifters?

The skin on my thumb is just now growing back from my last valve
adjustment.  Also, I've read that hydraulics are much quiter.

thanks
