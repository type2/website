Subject: Re: [T2] Heater... too much of a good thing!

hehe.. yeah, my dad used to wire it open as well.  I was *determined* to 
fix it right and I think I spent a couple weeks under that car.. my god 
it was frustrating.  I was trying to root out the old tube with spring 
steel on the end of a drill and finally just gave up and cut the stupid 
thing off when I broke the steel inside the tube!!  Heck, I could have 
just zip-tied the new cable to the old tubes, but I wanted it to look 
slick... it's my weakness ;)

&gt; I too encountered the rusty guide tube problem- one old cable would not

&gt; one would lie underneath and wire open the flapper box- a messy choice- 
&gt; many do this just for winter.  . I rigged a wire from the flapper box
