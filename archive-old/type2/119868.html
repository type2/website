So is it OK to tee the hose off the canister into the crankcase 
breather hose?  this is not going to force any gas fumes into the 
crankcase or vice versa?  Which one has more pressure or if they both have 
pressure at least will there be no problem either way? 
What if there is no hose from fan shroud to canister and thus no 
pressure from canister?  
I can't find the hose off my shroud that's supposed to go to canister.  Where is it?  There is one poked into my shroud front below the distrubutor but is this it?
