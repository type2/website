Subject: SIR came through

Hi All,

SIR finally got it almost right.  My third crank and oil cooler arrived
today at SIR's expense.  The crank is indeed a 40 hp this time.  Same
problem w/the oil cooler though.  Fresh paint w/dirty innards.  I carefully
explained to them that I had plenty of dirty oil coolers and lacked the
ability to clean them.  Evidently they do to. 

As far as doing future business with them?  Not sure.  All the parts have
been good (except the coolers) but the service was rotten.  Stark contrast
to other mail order shops who have been very prompt about sending crap.

Can anyone suggest a source of good parts/service at reasonable prices?  (I
use RMMW for anything cosmetic but they are too pricy for mechanical stuff)
 How is Mark Stevens w/the upright parts?
