This is the normal way to start ANY hot engine since Hector was a pup. All
drivers learned this from their fathers when they were 14. VW has a funny way of
putting it in the owners' manual: slowly depress the gas pedal&quot;.
Duh? If you slowly depress the gas pedal, soon it will be fully depressed. On a
hot engine, might as well fully depress it first.

Your mechanic is exactly right- it lets in more air. Even on a cold engine that
is flooded, there is a device that opens the choke blade a little to let in more
air and unflood it.
On FI engines, this is less relevant, because the injectors on inject relevant
to the position of the blade in the AFM anyway. Some OLD FI might still need
open throttle when hot starting.

&gt; I had been having this problem every once in a while and it finally happened
&gt; while I was at my mechanics shop. He heard me trying to start it up and said
&gt; to floor the gas. I thought that was crazy but I did it and it started right
&gt; up. He says when it is hot and hot outside some gas gurgles into the carb or
&gt; something like that and floods the engine. Don't remember if he said it
&gt; flushes it out or what but he said there is more air going into the engine
&gt; at cranking speed then gas... still not sure of his explanation but it
&gt; worked.
