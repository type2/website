Subject: Re: [T2] Aux battery size / rating?

&gt; What is the appropriate physical size of a Bus battery (or aux battery,
&gt; though they look the same to me).  I'm looking for a &quot;size code&quot; that I
&gt; can use when pricing new batteries.

41 is the standard battery size but the smaller 42 fits also. There is often
only a $10 price difference between the two but the larger battery has
significantly more starting capacity (45%). If you plan on going or living
anywhere where it gets cold the bigger battery is worth it. Being an
erstwhile Canadian I'll let the real Canadians vouch for the usefulness of
the larger battery.

The important thing is to get a battery with &quot;reversed terminals&quot; so the
battery isn't installed backwards.

&gt; I looked in my glovebox manual, and it didn't say.  Archives / Library
&gt; check didn't turn up anything, either.

All it says is 45Ah or 54Ah.
