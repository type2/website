Subject: Hydraulic lifters noisy

 I've got a little over 300 miles on the &quot;new&quot; GEX engine I put into
 my Vanagon and I've noticed that the hydraulic lifters are noisy on
 startup in the morning.  They clatter for 15-30 seconds and then
 quiet down.  I've never encountered this before - any idea what's
 causing it?

 Could too &quot;tight&quot; or too &quot;loose&quot; an adjustment of the rocker arms be
 causing this?  I'm running the recommended multi-weight oil and it
 just seems odd to me that the lifters could be draining after sitting
 overnight.
