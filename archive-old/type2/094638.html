Subject: Re: [T2] Re: need idle advice

Talking the one that is right on the air flow metering sensor.  Not the

&gt; When you say CO screw, do you mean the idle screw that Jay mentioned? 
&gt; The one right on the throttle, big old slotted job?  Or is there 
&gt; something else... See, i had the same problem as him, and i fixed it, 
&gt; but i don't really know how, so i can't really help him.  I just wonder 
&gt; if my mixture is messed up, because i messed with that screw...  Maybe 
&gt; i'm just being a hypochondriac.
&gt; Thanks.
