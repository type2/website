Did you run a wire from one of the 2 spade terminals on the starter solenoid
to the double relay? When the starter solenoid gets the crank signal, the
relay also gets 12v to run the pump. The wire goes to terminal 86a of the
relay.
If you have this wire and it is connected to one of the top 2 spades on the
solenoid [NOT the lower one!] then disconnect it and touch it to the battery
post on the solenoid. Listen and you should hear the pump running strong and
steady. If it is not running, get a test light or voltmeter and see if you
have 12v at the pump. If you do, you have either a bad ground at the pump or
a bad pump. If you don't, you have either a bad double relay or the wiring
is incorrect.
Do not give up on the FI so quickly.....correct the problem 1st.


&gt; I need help :'(
&gt;
&gt; I installed my FI 1800cc in my '74 westy and can't get it to
&gt; start. I think that my problem is in the fuel system. I am definatly
&gt; getting spark at the plugs (pulled one plug out to see a little white
&gt; spark.... shouldn't it be blue?). I think the fault lies in either the
&gt; double relay, the wiring, or the fuel pump. So this is what I did. I wired
&gt; it up the right way. Nothing. suspected the wiring system to be faulty so
&gt; I wired the pump directly to the ignition switch .... when the key is
&gt; turned I can
&gt; feel/hear the pump click. But no whirrr, hum, or vibration. I think i can
&gt; hear
&gt; gas move through the lines, but maybe thats just my optimistic
&gt; imagination.  I seem to remember the pump
&gt; in my other bus hum and vibrate when operating. I'm doubtful that the
&gt; relay is shot, it worked when I
&gt; pulled it from my other bus, along with the entire FI system aside from
&gt; the fuel pump. Should the pump hum when it gets power? Is it supposed to
&gt; click? I can't really smell any gas in the engine compartment, no matter
&gt; how much I turn the starter, and I did a lot today, until the battery
&gt; died. I am just about ready to throw this whole FI system out the window
&gt; and go with those nice dual Weber 34ICT's I have on my type 3 engine in
&gt; the basement. But the whole intent of this project was to have a FI bus.
&gt; Please help me help the FI :)
