&gt;         I have a '78 camper that has what looks like dual exhaust
&gt; pipes.The pipes are located 1 on either side of the motor and are mounted
&gt; to the frame. They are about 2 feet long and attach to a piece of cooling
&gt; tin on the motor via a fresh air/heater hose. The pipes are 2 inch
&gt; outside diameter and I can not find a hose to fit. Beetle hose are almost
&gt; 2 inches but not quite. Anyone know what these are for and where can I
&gt; find a 2 inch hose? TIA

The pipes are to carry away hot air from the heater boxes when
the dashboard heater switch is off.

I used wire-impregnated hose from a boating supply. This kind
of hose is generally used to direct exhaust through the transom
of a boat.  It withstands high temperature and the elements
quite well.
