Subject: Plumbing &amp; Fuel Pump for a late BN4 Gas Heater

Bought a BN4 last spring and bench tested, got it working and
everything seemed to work just fine. I let it run and run on
the bench and had no probs, functioned as it should. Then 
after installing it, it would only run for a few mins and then
shut off. Like it wasn't getting any fuel and the safety 
features kicked in and shut her down cause of no ignition.

I have a '76 FI westy and was wondering the best way to route 
the fuel line to the gas heater. I assumed it would not be 
wise to &quot;T&quot; into the FI ring since it is pressurized at 
30 or so psi so I &quot;T'd&quot; into the line coming out of the tank
before the FI fuel pump, but when I tried to run the heater 
it acted as though it wasn't recieving fuel.

I then installed a low pressure after market purolator pump, about 2-4psi inline and then the heater would ignite and run but now only for about 10 mins or so and it shuts down. Maybe now it is getting too much fuel. Is there a better way to route the fuel lines to the heater fuel pump on the FI buses? Or possibly would the purolator fuel pump suffice to run the heater by itself? Has anyone used an aftermarket fuel pump to
run their heater? Sorry about the length and thanks for the
help.
