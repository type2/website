Cool!

BTW, you don't need to get the engine *exactly* at TDC, although
it should pretty easy to do so if your pulley and scale are
clean.  All you care about is that the valves aren't open, and
if your engine was running OK before you started, then having
the rotor point to the crack on the distributor is good enough.

Also, you can usually &quot;feel&quot; where TDC is by the engine's
resistance to turning.  When pistons are mid-stroke, turning the
engine one direction is really hard because you're compressing
air, and turning it the other way is really easy (the compressed
air helps it spring back).  When you get closer to TDC, turning
the engine back and forth 10 degrees or so is easy because the
piston is near the top and isn't moving up or down much.  TDC is
right in the center of the little &quot;easy turning&quot; range, or at
least close enough for valve adjusting purposes.

Finally, I usually write down the valve clearances before I
start adjusting.  If I notice that I'm having to add more and
more space to an exhaust valve over a couple of adjustments, I
know that the valve stem is stretching and it's time for a head
rebuild (instead of an engine rebuild after the valve snaps off
in the piston).

My experience with dealers is that they get one or more valves
.002&quot; or more off.  I've had the valves adjusted, and just by
listening to the clatter, I was able to tell that they screwed
up.  I immediately shut down, waited half an hour until it was
stone cold again, crawled under (thus getting dirty and negating
the reason I had paid the dealer $50 or whatever), checked the
clearances and sure enough, two valves were over .008&quot; and one
was under .004&quot;.  Morons.

So you've probably saved yourself some hassle and possible
engine damage.
