Subject: Questions on tranny, and break-in '77 Westy

Whoa!!

The '76-79 trannys were the strongest available, and had the highest
(numerically lowest) gearing, making freeway cruising much better.

The R&amp;P of the 77 is 4.57, and I think the 72 is either 5.375 or 4.86 (I
forget). Also 4th gear on the 77 is .88 as opposed to .82 for the 72, making
the final jump from third to 4th an easier one.

If you get the 72 with a .82 4th and a 4.86, your freeway RPM should be
about the same as your standard tranny. If you get a 5.375 tranny, take it
back! You'll be pulling way to many RPM's on the freeway!

&gt; way)
