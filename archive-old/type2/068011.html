Subject: Forwarded: Heater controls

Thanks to all who responded to my heater control questions. My bus has four 
controls plus a fan switch. The controls slide horizontal. It's starting to jell.

Seems like the &quot;A&quot; control(top) directs heated air: (L-R) F&amp;R, F &amp; Defrost 
                                                                                        The &quot;B&quot; control determines amount of heat: (L-R) min to max
                                                                                        The &quot;C&quot; control adds fresh air to defrost and lower front and rear 
                                                                                        heat ducts: (L-R) max to min
                                                                                        The &quot;D&quot; control(bottom) adds fresh air to roof vents: (L-R) max to min

I think this is it on my van.. but I'm not sure about the fan function!

I previously wrote...
I just realized that since I just recently bought my 4th bus that it's 
about time I came to grips with the heater controls. Am I alone? I have 
never felt competent at adjusting them. 
What I know..

                        All to the right = defrost
                        Heat to the left=       cool
                        Heat to the right=      Hot

                I'm not sure about the rest (Don't make fun of me now...I've only been 
driving these babys for about 15 years)

I have the manual.. It doesn't make it clear to me. Is there a good description
of what these controls actually do and how they work in some other book or publication?
