Neither JB-Weld or Loctite are as hard as that woodruff key.  I really
doubt that either would fill the gap for an extended length of time.

It bothers me that the manufacturers of these products (particularly
JB) persist in implying that the stuff is as strong as metal.  JB is
great epoxy, particularly in fuel-contact use, but there is no way
that it will take the loads steel will.

One solution I've seen for your problem is to take a larger key and
grind it down to size.  This is a fairly lengthy process, but it will
yield an excellent fit.  The oversize key is initially thinned with a
Dremel grinder, then is finished on a whetstone.  You could even make
a stepped key if you had to!  Grind slowly to keep the temperatures
down. Forget using a file, as the keys are hardened!
