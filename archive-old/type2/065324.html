While I am certainly not The One Who Know All (I believe Bob Hoover is 
vying for that title), I am pretty sure the 009 is not the stock 
distributor for your bus.  

The stock 7.5 deg BTDC spec is for a *stock* distributor, and the 009 is 
designed to be timed to a different place.  Probably somewhere around 20 
deg BTDC, if you're listening to your bus.  I'm sure someone else can 
give you the recommended timing for the 009.

I'm not going to get into the debate about whether running a 009 
in a FI bus is The Right Thing To Do.  I run a stock distibutor in my 
bus, FWIW, and have never had any problems with it.
