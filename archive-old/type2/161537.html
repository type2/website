How many Canadian folks are driving your Buses in the winter? Even if mine had
decent heat I wouldn't drive it in the winter here in Minne-hopeless. MNDOT's
salt fetish would reduce it to dust in a couple years.

An aside; I just turned on CNN Headline News and during a story about Princess
Di a sage green Westy (like mine) cruised by as the reporter was blabbing
about something.

  Mine have block heaters.  Now I don't drive them in the winter so ....

  Pre block heater, I would wrap rear of bus in plastic with a square ceramic
  heater to warm it up.
