Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Drain Plug hmmmm

IMHO...

I've had my drain plug out twice, once when I rebuilt the engine, and 
once when I got the engine because the crush ring was leaking...

I know it's more work, but drain kits for the strainer and plate are 
cheap, and if you want to know what's going on in your engine, you don't 
find out through the drain hole until it's too late usually...

Removing the plate and checking it for contents is part of making sure 
the engine is healthy inside...I do that every time I change the oil and 
put a new filter on every time as well...I drive hard, and carry lots of 
extra &quot;Stuff&quot; so it's good insurance in my mind...

Just my $.02

Den.
