Subject: Re: [T2] High Head Temp (Long)

Wayne,

You absolutely must verify that the senders/gauges are actually right!
Or at least close enough for government work.

See my testing results on CHT senders/gauges on ratwell_dot_com
here http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/VDOGauges.html

Yes, you desperately need the rest of the sealing parts...especially 
around the spark plugs.  Stick your hand in there, rev the engine up and 
feel how much air comes out.

If you have a friend with an IR non contact thermometer it might be 
usefull when you think it is really hot to shoot the oil filter and see if 
it really reads 230 degrees.

I really hate it when gauges lie to me.

My standard 78 bus with A/C on at 99 F degrees reads 325 to 375
on the 3/4 head at 75 mph up or down hill.

Is my gauge lying....I think so....maybe in the opposite direction 
than yours!

Your first sentence below about it sounding and running great should be a 
clue.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I wrote about this before but now have more details - they should answer
&gt; some of your questions.  
&gt; 
&gt; First - on the whole the engine sounds and runs great.  Starts up all the
&gt; time, even when hot (has hot start relay).  Hydraulic lifter(s) are
&gt; sometimes a bit noisy when the engine is started after sitting a week or so
&gt; - this quiets down in less than a minute.  Oil pressure seems high when
&gt; engine is cold ~60-70 psi - goes down to around ~30-40 when warmed up and
&gt; driving and ~ 7-10 at idle.  Here are some more details.

&gt; Some rubber bits missing:
&gt; 	No sparkplug rubber in tin
&gt; 	No alt adjusting rubber in tin
&gt; 	Rubber around oil pressure sender is torn

&gt; 
&gt; Now for the high head temp info as it related to today's test drive.
&gt; 
&gt; Today's outside temp ~ 83 degrees
&gt; Oil temp ~ 230 degrees
&gt; Oil pressure ~ 30 psi
&gt; Head temp runs around 400 +/- degrees on flat ground at ~ 65mph
&gt; On moderate up hills (I live in Connecticut) head temp rises and after long
&gt; up hill or steep hill it will hit 450 until I get off gas
&gt; 
&gt; Spark plug color looks like Nestles Quick Powder (my old standard) that
&gt; would make me think mixture was OK


&gt; 
&gt; I've not yet checked for mouse of other varmint nests under the tin - that
&gt; is my next task.  Or possibly very dirty cooling fins on the cylinders -
&gt; there are oil leaks around some of the push rod tubes.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think I've left anything out :-)  Your thoughts would be
&gt; appreciated.
