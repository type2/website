All of the talk of Jeeps and Saabs aside, I have replaced several starters
in my '72 Westy.  I always experienced this &quot;starter won't turn over while
hot&quot; syndrome in the days or weeks before the started finally did fail.
This has happened enough times for me to believe there is a cause and
effect relationship here.
