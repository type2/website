Subject: replacing metal brake lines

&gt;I got a good scare last night on the way home in my 1969 Campmobile when I
had to make a &gt;&quot;quick&quot; stop from 45 mph &gt;due to a cop directing traffic. I
hit the pedal a little harder than &gt;usual, it held for a second, then went
right to the floor. I &gt;was able to downshift quickly and &gt;slow down enough to
get by, and luckily I was only about a mile from home, so I &gt;didn't have &gt;too
much &quot;white knuckle&quot; drive time.
&gt;

I sure hoped you drove home at a crawling speed in first gear with the engine
idling
 and with your hand on the emergency brake.

I have a few random order of importance hints for you.

Replace all the metal brake lines as one job. Since one line already rusted
through, all are suspect. Metal lines can rust through from the inside
without any visible outside damage. If you or the PO did not change the brake
fluid every single year, then the inside of the metal lines may be badly
rusted and ready to bust open.

Another good reason to replace all the metal lines as one job, it that it is
really time efficient to do so. Over all you will not have to start the
project over and over: get out the tools, figure out what to do, put away all
the tools, take the bus off the jack stands; find somebody to help you bleed
the brakes, etc. You already will have the bus jacked up; you will already
have out the necessary tools; you will gain skill as you learn to bend the
lines to the correct angles and bend all the rest of the lines faster; you
will gain skill at aligning and starting the really difficult to start
threads.

Take your time starting the threads. Make sure you have not cross threaded
the parts, then make sure again. It costs a lot of time and money when you
discover you have ruined a caliper or brake cylinder or proportioning valve
when you ruined the fitting's threads by tightening a crossed threaded barrel
nut.

Some of the FLAPS generic brake lines have the correct threads but are
unuseable. They have a special type of dog leg thread set up such that the
end of the barrel nut has no threads and the threads start way up the nut.
Sometimes this dog leg thread arrangement is very useful to help start
threads that are difficult to align. But in the case of brake fittings, if
the threadless dog leg is too long, then the double flare end bottoms out and
you can't get any threads to start or you get only one thread to hold. I
really prefer that the barrel nuts have threads all the way to their end.

You will also know that all the lines have been replaced and that is one less
thing to worry about for the next 20 years as long as you replace the brake
fluid each year.

You are damn lucky you are not dead or worse killed somebody else

I am glad nobody was hurt.

Next time your brakes fail USE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE. That is what it is for.
You must use the emergency brake every time you park. If you use the
emergency brake every time you park you get in the habit of using it. You
would not even have had to think about what to do in the emergency no brakes
situation; you would have engaged the emergency brake automatically.

Keep the emergency brake adjusted so tightly that you cannot drive off if you
forget to take it off. Then you will not ruin your rear brakes. If you have
the emergency brake adjusted correctly, you will notice when the rear brakes
need adjustment because the emergency brake handle will come out further than
normal.

The best way to keep the emergency brake available for emergency stopping is
to use the emergency brake every time you park. A properly adjusted and
greased and regularly used emergency brake cable will not freeze or rust or
get stuck on. If your emergency brake is not working properly, then fix it.

It really doesn't matter that much if you are too lazy to keep your emergency
brake working and you kill only yourself because your regular brakes fail,
but it is totally unacceptable to kill someone else because you were too lazy
to keep your emergency brakes working.

I always paint brand new metal brake lines. I very carefully tape the ends
and any threads that may come in contact with the brake fluid. Brand new
replacement brake lines only have enough paint on them to keep them from
rusting on the store shelves.

There is a special brake cylinder and brake caliper assembly grease that can
mix with brake fluid. DO NOT CONFUSE THIS GREASE WITH &quot;CALIPER&quot; GREASE
available at all the FLAPS. The regular claliber kind of grease is only for
the outside metal parts of claipers that have metal parts that slide
together. This grease will ruin brakes if if gets inside the brake fluid.

Do not trust the FLAPS counter person to give you the correct grease. Read
the label; if it doesn't say that you can coat the inside of brake cylinder
parts with the grease, do not use it. Use this special assembly grease to
coat the metal brake line threads (and bleeder valve threads) and coat the
metal brake line inside of the barrel nut. This helps to prevent the metal
brake line from rusting to the barrel nut and then breaking when you try to
remove the nut.

It is not that hard to make all those really complicated bends. Just start at
one end and adjust as necessary. You can buy a cheap brake line bender if you
are worried about some really tight radius bend. I do have one, but I rarely
use it. If you bend the line and you create a crushed area, you have ruined
the line, do not use it, do not try to straigten it out. Buy a new line and
try again. Brake lines are cheap compared to human pain and suffering.

The metal brake lines are made of steel that is annealed to be soft and be
easily bent. However, you cannot bend it over and over and over or it will
fatigue and break open. After you make a bend, the metal gets &quot;hard&quot; and it
does not bend again easily. It is easy to make incorrect mirror image or
right left reversed bends.  Think about the bend you need, take your time,
make ONE BEND ONE TIME where you need to make the bend.

You will probably have to buy combinations of lines to do the job. Too long
is a good thing. It is very easy to add some extra bends in a long line to
shorten the line. Too short and it will not work at all.

To prevent twisting the metal brake line, always use two wrenches : &lt;one&gt; to
hold the coupling &lt;and two &gt; as you tighten the brake line barrel nut into
it.
