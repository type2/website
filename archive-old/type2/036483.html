Subject: 73 muffler install difficulty

List:

I am a mechanical idiot, I think the book was written for me....anyway have
a '73 that I successfully removed the old, rusty extractor type
exhaust....but my nice new stainless steel stock type muffler doesn't want
to co-operate....if I try to go straight on, it hangs up on the studs, if I
put one side on fully, the other side is about an inch or so too low...I
don't want to try to persuade it and break somthing...stupid questions, but
any help is appreciated as I need the bus soon for the big move to our own
house.


Thanks,
