Subject: Ignition options

There is something wrong with my ignition.  The other day I died on the highway.
Checked the spark and was getting itermittant and weak (orange) spark.   After
fooling with the points, etc., I got it to start an run again. But now I don't
trust the coil..Even though I'm running fine, I still have an orange spark; so
I'm gonna get a new coil.

But since I'm going to plunk down twenty or thirty little dollars, I'm wondering
if maybe there are some choices to be made.  IE different coils...some sort of
electronic system or what...

What are some of the non standard choices you've made?     John Jensen in
