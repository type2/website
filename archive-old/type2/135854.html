Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust Favorites, was:Monza style exhaust,

Thanks for all the input thus far on the Monza exhaust. I had feared 
that poor quality was typical of the Monza style exhaust, for once I 
was a slave to fashion, must be throwback to my love for dual exhaust 
on rice rockets &lt;grin&gt;.  My question as to a good quality version was 
in part due to the way Don's didn't go so well when he actually ran the 
bus, I recall it being super discolored.

So, scrapping the &quot;look&quot; for function, what are some of your personal 
favorites in the exhaust dept. ? Based on Durability, Sound, Look, Flow 
...

I currently have a non bus muffler with a chrome tip on the '73 that 
the PO had put on at Canadian Tire, its just starting to get a bit worn 
out. I figure with the new engine I might as well go tip to tail.
