Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum can replacement

From: Matt

&gt; With reference to the vacuum can replacement, is it possible to replace just
 the vacuum can on the original dual-advance distributors (74 with dual
 Solex)?

Yes, 2 screws and a C clip hold it on. I am assuming you have this distributor?

Bus &amp; Pickup 1974 * 1800 Manual Trans Dual Carbs
Note: Bosch lists this application as Federal Models Only
Distributor: VW 021-905-205N, Bosch 0231 181 005
Can Use: VW 021-905-205J, Bosch 0231 173 009 or 010
Vacuum Can: 07 115
Timing Set At:: 10deg ATDC _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s) connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 7-12deg Adv, 16-18deg Ret; Centrifugal: 9-14deg _at_ 2000rpm, 21-25deg _at_ 3400 rpm

The 07 115 vacuum unit means you should have 953 on the arm. The 'can use' dist number 205J, has a 07 113
vacuum unit:

Bus &amp; Pickup 1973 * 1700 Manual Trans
Distributor: VW 021-905-205J, Bosch 0231 173 009 or 010 &gt; 021-905-205N, 0231 181 005
Can Use: VW 021-905-205N, Bosch 0231 181 005
Vacuum Can: 07 113
Timing Set At:: 10deg ATDC _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s) connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 7-12deg Adv, 16-18deg Ret; Centrifugal: 9-14deg _at_ 2000rpm, 21-25deg _at_ 3400 rpm

The 07 113 should have 925 on the arm.

07 115 = 953 = Bosch part number 1 237 121 953
07 113 = 925 = Bosch part number 1 237 121 925

Both have the exact same curve.

&gt; If so, where could one be found?

Good question..... maybe Bosch still supplies it?  I don't know.
I may have a good used one here....I would need to look.
But don't just put one on if the the numbers don't match! They are all different.
If you come up with different numbers on the arms, let me know what they are and
I can tell you what they fit.
