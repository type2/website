Subject: Smog testing article

I wrote up all I know about smog testing our buses in California:

http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Smog.html

Most of this information has been previously spread amongst many  
postings from the list but I believe I've collected the best of it in  
one place. I've drawn mainly from my own experiences so some details  
may not be correct for your testing area.

If you have any comments or find any errors please let me know. It's  
a work in progress but I thought it useful to post what I have so far  
(perfection being the mortal enemy of good).
