Subject: Re: idle problem in 73 dual carb

Just a thought, fellow campers, about one of the possible causes of our carb, 
idle, and stalling problems. Gasohol.  How many of us live in states where 
they occasionally, or always put alcohol in the gas??  Some stations do, even 
if it aint mandated. I had a 76 Honda Accord, a great little car, that ran 
like a race car until it got gasohol. Then, it would hardly get away from the 
pump. I have noticed a marked difference in performance in my bus when I 
travel to places that demand gasohol. Keep your eyes and mind open for this, 
it may help explain things.  Just a thought.
