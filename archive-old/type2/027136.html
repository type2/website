Subject: 71 Intake Manifold dilemma

Does anyone know where I could find a 71 DP intake manifold? I tried the Bus 
Depot without luck (not available). I have a brand new 34-PICT3 carburator 
for my 70 bus (which has a dual-port engine), but I need a new manifold for 
it to fit. It previously had the stock 70 carb in it with the original 
manifold.

Stuck with fingers crossed,
Will
