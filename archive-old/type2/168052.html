Subject: Re: [T2] Thoughts on locking engine compartment

I have a friend who wanted the locking handle also. He drilled and small  
hole the size of a quarter behind the tag. He had a rubber plug that fit  
perfect. So in the event of a fire he could bend the tag up a just push his  
extiguisher hose in and pull the trigger. The handle will get hotter than the  tag. 
Another problem with opening the lid in the event of a fire is the fire  will 
come out as you open the lid. Always be careful. Also carry a big  extiguisher. 
Those little ones are cool because they are small but, better to  have too big 
of an extiguisher then to run the little one out and then have  nothing.
replace those fuel lines. Replace those fuel lines.
