I am considering making my sunroof history -- who needs
the leaks, some niblets of parts are impossible to find
around here, I only really like it when I am carrying
tall bookcases, etc.  However, I am as much a stock
purist as the next guy and would welcome alternatives.

1. duct tape the roof  --  No

2. serious overhaul  --  Low utility for me, and the drain
that goes through the right front column is now perforated
into the cabin at one foot above the floor; it is this head
scratcher that has most of my current attention

3. some sort of clever filler strip  --  Has to be pretty
clever to really prevent water entry and, remember, I live
in New England so winter ice, etc., is inevitable, but this
should be possible, I would think, with some sort of rubber
T-shaped thing that, for all I know, is already in manufacture
somewhere

4. welding/grinding/new headliner  --  No one need ever know
I even ever had a sunroof and I need to paint this baby anyway

5. a few tubes of bathtub caulk or the like  --  I do not
like repairs unless they are permanent or reversible

6. trade-in  --  anyone have a '78 non-sunroof model with
165K miles and a new front end they want to trade?

7. your creative idea  --  here

8. I am whining  --  should be told I am
