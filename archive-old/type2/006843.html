Chad,

Sounds like the clutch might be out of need adjustment.  Usually a person
can feel the clutch engage with their foot, and if it isn't then the clutch
might be the issue, either worn out, poor adjustment (cable could have
streched) or there is oil in that area and no traction.  do you see oil
under the car (more the usual?)

Or, if the exhausted isn't bad (black smoke) and the engine still starts
and runs it could not have any power from the distributor settings (timing),
or value settings.  However these usually don't go out graduatly along a
highway.

-Wayne

Subject: [T2] A.I.R.S. Request


This morning I received a call from a Bills Downs (from Atlanta, anyone
know him?) who was on his way back home from West Virginia.  He's
currently in Statesville, where his engine has evidently given up the
ghost.  His 1969 bus is at a garage in Statesville, and he's staying at
a friend's house.  The garage is telling him that he needs a new engine
and is quoting an unreasonable price for the job.

Bill called me seeking ideas on how to get his bus to the Southern part
of Georgia, where his trusted VW mechanic is.  His mechanic has
supposedly located a good engine and is negotiating to purchase it on
Bill's behalf.  Bill, who had gotten back to Atlanta by other means and
has purchased a used car, came back to Statesville with the intent of
renting a tow dolly and pulling his bus back.  However, he ran into the
ol' &quot;we won't rent a dolly to any one driving a vehicle with less that a
5,000 lb hitch&quot; deal.  Bill has checked and the biggest hitch he can put
on his car is 3,500 lbs.

I suggested to Bill that if he can obtained a reliable engine, he ought
to consider just bringing the engine to Statesville where we would be
able to install it for him in short order.  This hadn't occurred to
Bill, who by his own admission is no mechanic, but he liked the idea.

Here's the question.  The garage in Statesville has declared the engine
dead and told Bill they didn't think it is a transmission problem.  Bill
said that prior to Statesville he was gradually losing power, until it
reached the point it would barely move.  I can sort of hold my own
working on my own bus, but I've never dealt with my transmission, and I
am not experienced at diagnosing things over the phone (the right
questions never seem to come to mind).  Bill said the engine will start,
but has no power.  He said if the engine is off, and you put the bus in
gear, it will roll.  If his clutch is gone, it would roll, but wouldn't
it then not move at all under it's own power?  What problems with the
transmission should he/we check for?  I can bring an extra transmission
(unknown) with me if we go down to help with the engine swap, and clutch
problems should be readily detectable after we pull the engine, but I'd
like to be able to evaluate the transmission.

Bill's supposed to call me back later today and let me know what
arrangements he has been able to make about the replacement engine.  It
looks like I might be driving to Statesville Saturday morning.  I'd
appreciate any ideas and input.

Thanks,
