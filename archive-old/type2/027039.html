Hi everyone.  on April 26th I posted about high temps in my new engine.  
(*new guy with questions* thread)  I decided to not drive it until I could 
follow all the advice I got.  Well, I discovered something today while I was 
replacing the wire from the temp sender to the temp gauge.  Although the 
mechanic who built this engine did a great job of sealing the rear, he 
neglected to seal the front.  The old rubber is still attached to the 
firewall but there's a gap of about 2 inches all the way across.  AND 
there's no thermostat flap.  Seems funny to me, but maybe since it's hot 
here (107 last week) I don't need the flap to close when starting from cold? 
  But I'm sure it runs hot because the 2&quot; gap at the firewall.  Lots of air 
flows in here (heated from pavement?) and also: can debris from the road 
enter here and destroy my new fan &amp; housing?  Any suggestions?

What I have (for a reminder): 68 Camper, with 66 case, now 1600 dualport &amp; 
doghouse added, all new tin, with less than 500 miles on the clock.  Runs 
about 210 in town, and if I try to take it out on the highway it creeps up 
to 250 very fast.  The temp sender is the type that goes in the relief valve 
and the gauge is a VDO but of unknown age.

Thanks again for your help.
