Subject: Re: [T2]oil filler cap seal

&gt;So what is the part number for the filler neck itself? 021 115 317 ?

My source says that is correct.

On mine it was a flat seal that was up in the head of the filler neck. I 
will try and get a good picture...

I have never seen an original seal, I suppose mine could of been added by a 
PO.
