Subject: the 215,000mi bus's SECOND dying/ warning

Well, in its lifetime of rolling, the 78 Westy had only its second day
of dying! (first was breoken points rubbing block).   To top it off, it
blew a &quot;brand new looking&quot; tire! The short story: plugged fuel filter;
tire lost entire tread! (Go to **** for tire story).
  The long story- before NJ inspection, (June 1)  I switched a front
tire with a &quot;new looking&quot; one pulled from a parts Westy spare tire well-
a German made Rallye with the right specs, and looking perfect in the
tread and sidewall; had I seen cracks I wouldn't have used it.  Also did
a full tuneup.  Passed inspection on emmissions , woohoo!  Took this bus
to the shore Sat. and it got 21.5 mpg from a previous 18.  
   We left for the Maple Grove show this Sunday (85 mi, and getting onto
the Pa turnpike, I noticed hesitation on giving it gas, which got worse
when going up any hill.  Bombed fine down the hill, so I was guessing no
ignition problem, but gas starvation, air being sucked in somewhere?
Daughter went for some food at a rest stop, and it idled fine, revved up
fine in the parking lot- so off we went.  Hesitation got worse on those
mid Pa hills; by the time of the big hill before the show it did a bit
of backfiring and stalled getting it into the show row of busses.
   Jon, a good mechanic suggested it was an air block (fuel starvation,
like when a carb overheats), and I suggested a blocked tank/filter
because I had siliconed the fuel filler inlet once and some of it had
delaminated.  I even scrounged a tire valve, planning to udse my little
compressor to blow air up the gas line if there was something stuck at
inlet.  However, sitting there, it ran fine, retimed it, checked a loose
air hose (wired it), and upon leaving the show, it severely hesitated in
the lot (and died) with the wierdest running- you step on it; it runs,
slows to  a &quot;near death&quot;, then reruns for a second, slows, etc, and died
if I tried to give throttle to take off.  So I unscrewed the fuel rail
bleeder (left side) and stuck a hose on it, had Nyssa turn over the
engine- yes some air bubbles, but the flow was more of a slow running,
not 30 psi squirting. No unusual sounds from pump.
   Finally got out a small bucket and the visegrips (needlenose style,
rounded so it couldn't cut hose), clamped the line before the filter
(replaced last lat July?) and yanked it- lotsa brown stuff came out on
my hand!  Unclamped the visegrip to watch the flow into the bucket, and
out came brown followed by clear running gas.  In the bucket was a fine
particulate (like 2 cc worth when gas dried) of brown rust!
   *****Oh well, tank will need coating/replacing- I put a new filter on
and off we went in fine form until 1/2 hr before home I noticed a little
vibration in the front (the road ain't the best anyway) and then the
driver side front tire exploded (I was in the passing lane next to a
concrete divider!)  The &quot;sloppy fairies&quot; were watching, for I managed to
just steer it off the divider and stopped it, waiting for traffic to ebb
so I could limp it to the other side.  That shoulder was too small
(another wall) and I rolled it along to where it widened safely at an
off ramp and we changed it- my 14 yr old's first experience at changing
a tire!  With a marginal jack point, I use the small rolling jack
(Walmart) under the lowest lip of the torsion bar housing and it raises
it enough.  The entire tread was gone, but not like a retread- the side
1/2&quot; or so of tread was still there! The inner plies blew out at one
point, with steel sticking out in a big shredded flap.
   The moral?  DON'T USE OLD/Unknown age  TIRES even if they don't look
cracked- I think the adhesion between tread and plies had separated, and
then the tread failed.  This happened to Jim Lecrone also, who severely
damaged his rear tire well from the shredded tire.  If some tire expert
reads this far, I noticed the tire has no traction/wear rating on it-
when was this required?
