Subject: Welding Thank You

Folks,
        I just wanted everyone to know how much I appreciate the helpfulness of
everyone on the list. I want to publicly thank list-member Herb Harmison
(in Iowa also) for letting me spend the morning today checking out his
welders, letting me try a little myself, and just talking. It is great
when we get to meet each other in person. Then we can realize that
although we are different people, we have something in common that can
cross boundaries. It was an enjoyable visit, a nice day to drive the
Karmann Ghia and to learn something new.
