&gt; The one thing everybody left off.
&gt; You need to massage the upper sealing part of the O rinf in the head with
&gt; a small screwdriver to get it to slip in without cutting or pinching your
&gt; O ring.
&gt; Everytime I've had my heads off I've tried to remember to polish that
&gt; pesky sharp edge off the heads where the O rings slip in but I never get
&gt; it done.

I watched the Bug Me Video Type4 rebuild last night.  In the video Jake made
inserting the seals look effortless.  When I was under the car doing it, I
had to tap them to go in and be very careful about pinching the seals.  I
didn't think to smooth the edges either.

I pinched one slightly even though I used lots of oil.  Next time I will oil
the contact area more instead of just the seals.

The archive was my source of info at the time:
