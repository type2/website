&lt;&lt; While tuning her up, I found she
 wouldn't run right until the timing was 15 degrees BTDC.  &gt;&gt;

first is this a sock engine....stock cam....etc.??  that all makes a
difference in setting timing.   but i would figure it out soon...being set at
15 btdc will give  you a heck of a lot of advance.  usually a dizzy set at 7.5
btdc will max out around 26 total degrees advance( my beetle is this
way)......so crunching the numbers you are getting way to much advance.
hopefully this engine is not stock..1600 is small for 40 mm carbs....even if
you do have an extractor type exhaust to remove all the extra fuel you are
sucking in..............
