&gt;Simple Question:
&gt;Let's say you order a new valve from Rocky Mtn. Whn you get the valve, do
&gt;you have to get a machinist to cut the new valve to fit the valve seat? I
&gt;seem to remember something in my Bentley about cutting the head of the
&gt;valve to three different angles.
&gt;
&gt;BTW, this is on a 1700 CC Type IV.

The best solution is to have the seat ground to match the valve, then lap
it for a perfect seal.  Depending on the condition of the seat, you might
be able to get away with just lapping.  You can buy lapping compound at
Napa.  I find it's easier to chuck the valve in a variable speed reversing
drill (after the valve is in the head of course and lapping compound has
been applied) and using the drill to turn the valve slowly.  You need to
constantly seat and unseat the valve and reverse directions so that the
compound will cut properly.  Apply new compound every so often too.  Lube
the valve stem well with assembly lube before you do this to protect your
guides.

NOTE:  I am an ametuer at this - the above is what works for me and may or
may not be good for you and your parts.
