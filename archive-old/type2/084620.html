&gt;So I am happily shopping for stuff at my favorite local dealer today. I
&gt;picked up some door handles and other broken stuff for my new baby.  When
&gt;the shop owner informs me that his mechanic refuses to work on my=
 particular
&gt;year of westy.  And he proceeded to list the following &quot;known&quot; problems:
&gt;
&gt;1. Throttle linkage wears out and creates a vaccuum leak on the dual carbs.

Whatever.  The vacuum leak will be very minor except in extreme cases and=20
is easily compensated for by idle jets to attain a smooth idle.  I ran this=
=20
way for years.  Under load, the leak will be insignificant.  If you're=20
paranoid about it, there are places that will rebush the shafts for under=20
$50 - check the archives.  It's a simple procedure that any machine shop=20
should be able to do.

&gt;2. The engine is hard to access and therefore work on.

Whatever.  Just because 72 is the one year without an overhead hatch.  It's=
=20
still easier to change spark plugs than on the majority of V8 cars on the=20
road today.  You can do everything you need to do through the rear=20
hatch.  I have the overhead hatch and almost never use it.

&gt;His main bone of contention seemed to be the carb situation. He seems to
&gt;dislike the dual carbs with a passion. Maybe they stomped on his flower bed
&gt;in a previous life. But anyway, I am a little disheartened, how big of a
&gt;deal is this? Opinions ideas? :-(

After let's see here... 12-odd years of running those carbs I can confirm=20
that they have their drawbacks.  The base flanges warp.  Throttle shafts=20
wear.  Linkage not well engineered.  Idle solenoids are=20
trouble-prone.  But, they deliver good fuel economy and are easy to work=20
on.  I can remove and disassemble a pair down to the last washer in 20=20
minutes.  Rebuild kits are available, as are jets.  When they are working=20
well, the bus will run like a Swiss watch.  I can see mechanics not liking=
=20
them because they deal with the problems all day and never reap the=20
benefits of smooth trouble-free camping trips across the country and 20mpg.

&gt;Question #2, exhaust leak near the head on the driver's side. It doesn=B9t
&gt;look like its the head itself so I suspect the heat exchanger is cracked.
&gt;The question is, can this be done engine in the bus or do I need to yank=
 it.

Heat exchangers can be removed with the engine in the bus.  Remove rear=20
tin, then muffler, then heat exchangers.  Be careful with the exhaust=20
studs, they may pull out or come out with the nut.  There should be copper=
=20
washers between the exchangers and the heads - they often stick to the=20
heads.  It's easy to have them move on installation and get squished in odd=
=20
directions, causing exhaust leaks.  Don't overtighten the nuts when you put=
=20
them back.  A few lb/ft is all it should take to seal to the head, a few=20
more to keep them tight.  Maybe 10 lb/ft max.  Use anti-seize on the=20
threads and use lock washers, preferably the stock flippy washers but use=20
the cut ones if you have to.
