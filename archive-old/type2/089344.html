Subject: Re: [T2] Hot Rods

[...]
havent used theirs but i have used other &quot;clearanced&quot; rods.  One engine 
i put together with them about 2 years ago is still running strong as 
of  a couple months ago.  If your staying mild and not all out drag you 
should be fine.

&gt; Does anyone have an opinion of CB Performances &quot; Hot Rods&quot;
&gt; http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/catalog.asp?ProductID=150 Since these guys 
&gt; sell
&gt; the questionable slip-in engine components, I can't tell if this 
&gt; product is
&gt; a medium performance alternative or a cheap shortcut.
