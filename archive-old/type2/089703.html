If they're in the tubing, what you absolutely positively don't want to do is 
kill them
and leave any evidence in there...Even if you hafta take the dash vents out 
or the
diverters at the ends of the heat exchangers to vacuum the tubing, remove ALL
the remains or else stench-city! especially if there's any remains there 
during 
heating season...;-(
