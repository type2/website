&gt; Jason,

&gt; Welcome to owning a bus in Colorado! You should have seen the old
&gt; BustedBus
&gt; yard. It was a 24 hour wasp farm. I have found nests (both occupied and
&gt; abandoned) in every bus I have ever been under.
&gt;
&gt; The only fix is to drive your ride regularly, move your parking location
&gt; often and wash the outside and underside of your bus whenever you can. For
&gt; some reason by washing my buses, wasps leave them alone. I guess they
&gt; figure
&gt; they are of value if they are clean so setting up house inside is too
&gt; risky.
&gt; :)
&gt;
&gt; I'd avoid the poison.
&gt;
&gt; L8TR,

Good call Jon. I really need to do a strong cleaning to her anyway.
