Subject: steering box crack

Should there be a huge vertical crack/seam/seperation in my steering box?

It seems to occur between where some horizonatally oriented bolts might be bringing two beveled edeges together...

I'm guessing not, and for some reason, my steering wheel tube has been, well, maneuverable in recent months.

Don't worry, the bus is off the road for summer as of today.
