Subject: X-country - bus needed in OR or somewhere between OR and MD

I have been lurking a while on the list as I was out of the country. Now
my 74 camper is being shipped from Germany to Baltimore, and I am
currently in Portland, OR in need of transportation to the East Coast.

So I am looking for either of two things:
- an affordable bus or camper in the Portland area that would not
require too much work to make it to the other coast (my tools are
somewhere on the Atlantic, too ...)

- a vehicle or vehicles that need to be transported to the East coast
or part of the way.

Please respond to me off-list for any hints or leads.

BTW, I have owned, driven, and restored buses for nearly 10 years.

Thanks,
Marcus

first registered on the same day - April 19, 1974
58 - 61 Opels - one of each year
