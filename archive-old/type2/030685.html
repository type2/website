It's a dualport, isnt it?:)

10:1 chance that the boots between manifold center, and manifold ends, are
bad.  PITA to replace, but you gotta do it.

it is ALSO possible that it is just a loose manifold end or two, or a
really cruddy carb.....

Check those boots, first.  You may not be able to visually see cracks, so
get it running for those few seconds, and carefully (warning! FIRE HAZARD!
perform at your own risk...) spray a bit of carb cleaner, starter fluid,
hair spray, or other flamable fluid or gas in that direction.  (a propane
torch is good for this,  you can get the tip right up to where you are
checking, and turn it on a sec, then off. easily controlled..)

If the motor vvrrrrrs! quicker when you do this, you have a vacuum leak
there!  you can also check for leaks at the carb base, and
manifold-to-head junction too.

later...david
