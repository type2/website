Subject: OEM wheels?

Hi People,

Pumpkin II came from the PO with what I am told are
Audi mag wheels.  Same bolt patter, but the the oem
studs are just a hair shorter than I'd prefer.  I also
need new tires, so I thought I would explore possibly
going back to OEM wheels and tires.

The audi's are 15&quot; diameter and the current tires are 
215 75 R15.  This provides plenty of clearance for
dirt roads (and mechanical work), but doesn't provide
the best &quot;gear ratio&quot; for the hills I climb.

I'm thinking of

a) Putting on slightly smaller tires and keeping the
audi rims (and installing longer studs). This would
keep some clerance, but improve the gear ratio.

b) Or just going with OEM rims and tires.

I do occasional dirtroads (at campgrounds) but nothing
too drastic.  

Thoughts?
