Subject: Stuck bus...something ain't right

&lt;snip&gt; of jonathan's long detailed description of weird &quot;stuck bus&quot; problem.

tonight it happened again. same parking space. same thing. didn't happen at
my house...didn't happen anywhere else. what could this be? IBM gremlins?
i really don't think it's the parking brake, because even when the brake is
on, you can go forward without the amount of resistance i'm experiencing.
any ideas??

VanBondo observes the oft quoted C++ techie joke that if you worked for
Microsoft it would just be called a &quot;feature&quot; and shipped...
