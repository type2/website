Subject: Westy top catching air

I was heading up the highway to see if my engine was still running hot,
(which it is) and I noticed that when I was driving into the wind at 55 mph,
my fiberglass top was catching air. It was up enough that I could almost get
two fingers between the seal and the bus. This can't be right. Is there
something I should be tightening down? The canvas will be replaced soon, as
a new one just showed up from Bus Depot.
