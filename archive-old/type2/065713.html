welded belly pans in to increase the ridgity of the bus to compensate for  the missing roof member that 
wasremoved  in the process of installing the sunroof

&gt; 
&gt; i have what may be a dumb question: while doing my fall inspection (lube,
&gt; tighten, knock off rust and zap it with zinc-rich paint(until I can grind
&gt; it)) under the 70, I thought, man if I just attach a piece (well, several
&gt; pieces, actually) of sheet metal under here, things would stay much
&gt; prettier! Is this goofy? It would take a few sheetmetal screws and some
&gt; careful measuring and cutting, but it seems that road noise, underbody
&gt; rust, and heat loss from the heater tubes would be reduced. Using a seal
&gt; around any edges you can do so would help keep water from getting in and
&gt; staying in. Since the loaf has all the aerodynamic qualities of a brick
&gt; anyways, I can't imagine this would affect things in that dept. Of course,
&gt; it would make maintenence day just a little longer, but the more time I
&gt; spend w/ the bus the happier I am, so... just a thought.
&gt; (BTW, if you cross BORDERS very often - DON'T DO THIS! BPatrol officers
&gt; *love* modifications done to car bodies!)
