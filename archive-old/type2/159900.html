Subject: Re: [T2] A Real Squeaker

Mike,

Can you jack up the bus, turn the wheels and hear the sound?

If you can, and it is rhythmical, with the turning of the wheel, it's 
likely brakes.  If you don't hear the squeak when there's no weight on 
the wheels it may be just lugs or an axle nut that needs tightening.

If it is bearings or a CV joint you'll probably hear and feel a gritty 
sound.

Doesn't hurt to check your brakes anyway.

Cheers,

John R
