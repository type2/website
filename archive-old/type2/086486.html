Subject: 76 alternator bracket

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C1FFFF.A96A64B0

Hey all!  I was in the process of installing my 71 engine in my bus, and =
a young lady stopped by and asked me if it was mine.  I told her yes, and=
 she asked me if I may be able to find an alternator bracket for a 76.  A=
pparently even the VW guy this way does not have 1.  Wondering if anyone =
out there might have a spare.  Her bus has the F1 2.0.  All parts I have =
are 71 and below.    Thanks          BTW, she lives in southern Vermont.G=
