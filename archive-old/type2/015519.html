It does depend on your point of view.

&gt;&gt;should I
&gt;&gt;replace them (TO bearing, pilot bearing)...
&gt;
&gt;Qoth Dr. Tim: &quot;At 150,000 miles???? You got to be kidding. Do you want
&gt;another 150,000
&gt;miles before failure, or a few months or years before you pull the motor
&gt;again????&quot;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Well, after I replaced that 150,000mi clutch I went 10,000 mi in 6 weeks
&gt;&gt;around the country- assumed I'd eventually pull the engine anyway, which
&gt;&gt;was 6 yrs, 70,000 mi ago...still assume I gotta rebuild it &quot;soon&quot;
&gt;&gt;sometimes? 

You may assume any risk your heart desires. Best cost/mile ratio comes from
removing as much risk as possible. Cost includes time/money for unnecessary
expenses like towing, missing work or play, pissing off the frau/kinder
because you can't do what you said you would do this weekend/month, calling
too many favors from former helpful friends or the time to pay back the
favors to maintain a balanced value and true friendship, which I consider a
perfectly and most proper economic exchange of extremely high value, but it
is all cost (time/money) associated with transportation. 

Consider how the equation changes if working on the bus on the weekend is
the best family time because Mutter und Patter und Kinder all learn
together and consider that FAMILY FUN TIME. Teach them things like, &quot;Do it
right the first time if you haven't got the time to do it over!&quot;, &quot;Don't
buy cheap tools! Pass them on to der Kinder with the knowledge of their
proper and improper uses.&quot; Your kinder will become very valuable to
themselves and all they serve in whatever vocation they seek with a few of
these universal principles in mind and applied for a lifetime. I don't know
how to put a rational value on that, ergo, in my mind, priceless as highest
and best good.   

Do, indeed, add value for the knowledge gained and skills developed with
the time. On the other side of the equation is cost to hire the work done.
If it takes you 4 hours to perform a correct procedure that would take a
skilled mechanic 1 hour to do and his rate is $70/hour, your hours were
worth $17.50. If you take home $20/hr in your vocation, hiring the work out
is ecomically feasable as a possible enhancement of the cost/mile ratio.
If you take home less, then consider the immediate expense of purchasing
the manuals/tools required to perform the procedure. Know that the next
time you perform that procedure, it will take you maybe 2 hours and they
will be valued at $35 each.

Buy quality tools with the money saved. If you do a procedure in a weekend
that would cost $500 to hire, buy the tools with the $500 and gain the
knowledge for future enhanced value in reuse. I do not advise Craftsman.
Their spans are typically cut just a bit too wide. Spec is tighter on the
better manufacturers. DIN standard wrenches are a bargain for spec work,
but for rusty nuts a few spezial items will be needed.

 I'd like to see if all will wear out at the same time (;  I
&gt;have this innate curiosity to see how long something will last if it
&gt;ain't broke and woulda put that plate back in if it weren't for the
&gt;broken spring- probably woulda outlasted the Canadian reline?? 

Indeed, share the knowledge gained from your experiment. If you value the
knowledge of &quot;what will happen if I do this???&quot; above the inconvienience of
parts forced to failure, that's wonderful. You may use whatever objective
or subjective ideas to justify whatever actions you contemplate. Share with
us what you value most.

Know it's quite different in you working on your own vehicle and me working
on a client's vehicle, but guess what, when I work on my T-II, I add more
time/money value than I would typically charge a client for the same
procedure. Client vehicles are maintained spec. My T-II/912/280CE get
enhanced specs. Takes more time than most people understand the value of in
enhanced functions and longevity. The expense of too much maintenance is
less than the expense of too little maintenance when the resulting repairs
get added, fer sur, but only if excellant results are perceived as
valuable, and excellent results being defined as best cost/mile in
continuouse, uninteruped use for purposes intended.
