Just checked things out a little.
Check out the new V class directly at:

http://www.mercedes-benz_dot_com/e/product/pkw/07.htm

HOWEVER there are NO plans to offer this outside of Europe yet.
Sounds like a nifty vehicle.  

Seating for 6 maybe 7.  In the 6 seater config the seatbelts are 
integral with the rear seats, so one can turn the seats around to face each 
other in the back, while driving!  How soon will a wrecked one be 
available! (even used, probably cost more than another VW bus)

Seats fold over to provide flat space or can be removed.

ABS of course, discs all around.  System to prevent slipping when 
accelerating on slippery ground.  Electronic Traction Assist or 
something like that.

Dual sliding doors.

No mention of camper options.

Even have a manual transmission option.  Diesel option too.
(I thought they gave up on manual transmissions in 1968)

If you can't afford it, don't even ask. Couldn't find a price and 
wasn't willing to go through the section on options to see IF they 
were going to list a price.

&gt; One of the winners was Mercedes. Scrolling around the form/frame you will
&gt; find a section for new Mercedes vans/buses!!! Unfortunately, with the
&gt; limited amount of time that I had to look at the site, I did not find a
&gt; &quot;Camper/Westy&quot; type option. Overall the design/style is the typical &quot;Baby
&gt; van&quot; design. Checkit out at:
