Subject: FI Deceleraton Valve

Folks,

My brother has a 2000l FI bus. He has been told by his experienced 
mechanic that the reason his bus always idles fast is that the 
deceleration valve us no good. All other possible causes have been 
eliminated.

His problem is the difficulty of getting a part here in Australia. 

Is the valve repairable? Is there a source in the States for these valves?

Thanks
