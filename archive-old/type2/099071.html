Subject: Re: [T2] the canadian border

Hey all:

I gotta chime in here.

I travel routinely to the usa and I do a fair amount of
travel in Europe for work.  (Its not all its cracked up
to be)

But anyway, the customs in USA and CANADA are the most
&quot;inquisitive&quot;.  And Richard is right, if they are not
busy, you soon will be.

Highlights of my many crossings:

Into USA: Being asked for my business cards to prove I
was actually on business. (At the time I was travelling
down once per month over a period of two years)Into USA

Crossing in USA by car, and being waved through!  (Not
even a check of the Passport)  Same trip, being waved
through back into canada (Not even a check of the
passport) three days later.

Waiting for 2 hours to pay $7.98 duty on a VCR.
(Returning to Canada)

My recommendation:  Be nice, be polite, and have
nothing to hide! 

Cheers
Logan
