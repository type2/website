Subject: Re: [T2] Mig Tig or Arc Wire Feed?

&gt; The only welding done without gas is Arc welding--
&gt;
&gt; You must be thinking about the econo Wally World mig welder's with the
&gt; flux coating on the wire, so you allegedly don't have to buy a bottle--

Well actually none of it is without gas really.
The Mig and tig have the sheilding gas in a bottle. this is good.
The wire-feed makes the gas when its flux core burns. not as good.
the Arc rods are coated and when the flux coating burns off...gas again.

and really its not power that you need to do bodywork. if you have a high
power mig it will mostly be at the lower settings anyway.
the real nice thing to have is duty-cycle at the power you use it at.
low duty cycle and youll have to keep stopping while it recovers.
100% would be ideal.
