Subject: Re: [T2] RE: [VB] tranny drain plug trick

I was in the same boat in 1992 i8n Italy so I took a VW wheel bolt and 
screwed a Ford Escort lugnut on it and welded it solid.


I've still got it and it works great.

That's what I love about VW's, easy to invent solutions that work.

&gt;For $1.16 I made a little tool today to get the drain and fill plugs out of
&gt;my '65
&gt;
&gt;1 - 3&quot; Automotive bolt with a 17mm head
&gt;2  17mm nuts
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The two nuts lock each other, so vise grips on the bottom one loosens, on
&gt;the top
&gt;one, tightens
&gt;Not one flaps, or even VW dealer even knew what I was talking about
&gt;when I asked about a 3/8 17mm hex socket.  The Foriegn Flaps guy said
&gt;&quot;you'll never find anything like that out here&quot; (CT).  So I made this little
&gt;thing and it's worked good so far. Will still order the socket from someone
&gt;for safe re-tightening
&gt;
&gt;Just thought I'd share my small triumph
