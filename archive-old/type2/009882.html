	Anna,
	0 compression means time to check the valves, and if
they're set ok, probably take off the head, which
means time to pull the engine. You can do it by yourself but you'd
be better off if you can recruit a friend to help. You can certainly
save money doing it yourself but not time, so you have to decide
which is dearer :(

	Mis-wiring the spark plugs so that the sparks were in the
wrong order isn't LIKELY to have caused the problem you describe,
though if the engine were really run for 30 minutes with the
wires wrong you should have gotten some pretty spectacular backfires
as unburned gas/air mixture from the cyliners getting the wrong
sparks encountered hot gas from the cyliners what were getting
the right sparks... that said, to get the plugs wrong two would
have to be swapped and that would make an engine that ran so
rough (only 2 of 4 cylinders firing) that it might not ever
have heated up enough to light the unburned stuff... 

	If you're not hearing all kinds of noises, then the failure
is either a hole in the piston or a valve that won't close. DO
check that they valves are in adjustment, it is possible for a mis-adjusted
value to never close and that would give you 0 compression.

	The classic #3 failure is a burned exhaust valve, which you
can read all about in the archives at Type2_dot_com. Luckily, its not
that tough to fix and you might get away with just doing one head
if $ are truely low. But remember that it's recomended to do both
if you possibly can.

	Bottom line, check the valves. If they have clearance and
you're still getting 0 compression then prepare to remove engine
and pull the heads off.

	Good luck,
	Bill
