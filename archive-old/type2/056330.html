Subject: Re: Additional battery

&gt; 
&gt; Now my question is what is it good for? The fridge in the 81 is propane or
&gt; shore powered so no need there. I can envision some interior, or even
&gt; exterior,  lighting but otherwise I'm drawing a blank. How do you folks who
&gt; have the batteries put them to use?


Fans!!  I like to run a fan to get some cross ventilation inside the Van
during the summer.  Plus, I like the security of having a backup.  The
sink uses power, as does the reading light I have above my sleeping area.
Were I to fall asleep with the light on, I have a back up.  Although it is
a small light that probably wouldn't hurt the battery anyway, when you're
10 miles from the nearest paved road it's nice to have some peace of mind,
even if it isn't really needed.
