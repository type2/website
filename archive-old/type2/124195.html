Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking Head Gasket??

Martin,
I have heard of leaving out the gasket before, but mainly from people trying
to up the compression. Can't say I've heard any bad things about it other than
needing more machining of the head to get a good seat after a re-build.
Richard


 have seen the following technical bulletin referred to a number of times
but have never seen any feedback. Has anybody done this? Does it do any
good? Also, I'm not clear on the details of the connecting rod grooves.
Does anyone have pictures that clarify them?

 &gt;You should NOT have put head gaskets back in.
 &gt;VW did away with them for a reason and you found out
why.......    &gt;http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/techbull.html

 &gt; What can cause a head gasket to leak on a type 4 motor?

Cheers,

Martin Strandgard
