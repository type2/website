Subject: Needed: Rear Bumper Mounting Bolt Sizes
References: &lt;200011171031.CAA55411_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

My early Christmas present this year was a new rear bumper for my little
'78 Bus to replace the old one that someone backed into. It should go
nicely with my new paint job, the only problem is, when the body shop
took off the bumper, they took a mounting bracket and all of the bolts.
Now it took me a few months to hunt down all these parts again, but I
still don't know what size bolts to hang this bumper with.

I need the sizes for both the bumper-to-bracket and bracket-to-Bus
bolts, if someone could get those for me, that'd be great.

Thanks alot,
Bj Warminski
