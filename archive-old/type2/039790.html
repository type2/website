Subject: Thieves stole some bus trim

Does anyone have the drivers side rear corner trim to fit on a 72 
HighTopper. My wife and I went junktiquing today and when I came out, the 
drivers side rear corner trim was gone. I guess someone figured they needed 
it worse than I did. Let me know if you have one or both sides since the 
passenger side on mine has a ding.

Thanks,
David
