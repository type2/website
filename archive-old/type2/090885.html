Subject: Broken fuel pump!

Hey all!

I was driving home the other day and my bus just
stopped.  I went round back and took a peek, finding
that the fuel pump had shattered into three or four
pieces.  I got it home, ordered a new pump, flange,
rod, and seals.  My engine is a 1600dp that I equiped
with a alternator.  I ordered the correct pump for a
car with an alternator as well as the correct rod. 
When I got it all apart I found that the rod in the
car was bent, and considerably longer then the one I
got from RMMW.  I figured that I needed to put one
back in the engine that was the same as the one I took
out.  So I went to the autoparts store and got a new
rod that was as long as the one I took out of the bus.
 I got home and put it all back togeter again.  When I
tried to start it, nothing happend.  The engine turns
and turns but never fires.  I'm assuming that I'm
still not getting fuel.  I tried it with the smaller
rod just to see what would happen and still nothing.

The only thing I'm not quite sure of is wether or not
I got the fuel hoses hooked to the appropriate places
on the pump.  Does the hose from the tank go the the
top hookup or the bottom hookup on the pump?  Any
other suggestions why she won't start?  Any Idea as to
what caused the old pump to fail so badly?  Also, any
comments on the pros and cons of using an electric
fuel pump in place of the mechanical one?

Thanks!
