&gt; &gt; Although Mr. Raby's web site does not give prices I believe he is in the

&gt;A year ago when the prices were still listed on the website a stock engine
&gt;started at $3k. It's much higher now and there is also a 4-6 month wait.

NW ConRod will do a long block to fine specs throughout for similar money, 
but they ship within a few days at most. They always forward with the long 
block all the other complete engine gaskets and seals that come with the 
spec kit they use and charge you for. So you have the intake and exhaust 
and other misc. goods needed for install. What else do you get for the 
extra money?? New studs, new cam and lifters, new heads if required, new 
valves, new pistons and cylinders, properly experienced and skilled 
machining of the case and heads and cranks and rods and flywheels, all OEM 
parts with rare exception. It's the lowest possible risk of failure and 
warrantee issues are a less than 1% event.

You cannot lower the price without compromise to the risk of failure element.
