&gt; Maybe not, maybe so. My Makita 9.6v has been running since 1991. Two

OK, one more post, then I am disappeearing agin...

First, if you want cordless, then of course the ore recent the better.
Battery tech has improved *immeasurably* in the las 15 years!

Second, as I take these tools apart my objection is not to the plastic,
tho I don't care for it, but rather to:

plain bearings vs. roller and ball bearings;
riveted construction vs. screws, nuts, and bolts making disassembly
impossible; and
rotor and stator insulation that is *waterproof* or at least not water
soluble!

The modern plastic cases are actually easier to work with.  The aluminum
cases have corroded shitlessly, alas, since the aluminum electrochemically
the &quot;hottest&quot; metal in the tool and acts as the electron donor.  This does
not bode well for flood-damaged  aluminum and magnesium engine cases,
tho:-(
