Subject: Mein VolksWagon ist ein FeurWagon! 

Well volks, my van burned yesterday. Remember those fuel lines people
were raving about. Well I guess one popped, and about 1000ft down the road from
home it was on fire. I stopped and lifted the engine flap to find a fire
about the size of 24 hamburgers flaming on a gas BBQ in the engine compartment. 
I didn't have anything to put it out, and was standing their wondering 
what to do when a van from a drywall company stopped. I asked if they had
a fire extinguisher. They didn't, and i asked it they had any water. They
held up a 2l jug of iced tea! I grabbed it, and reaching way back to fire
extinquisher school in the mines, hoofed the whole thing on it, thinking
I had nothing to lose, and just might slow it down a bit until the fire
department arrived. To my ammazement, it put aout ost of it. There was one
burning hose left, and a small part of the engine seal still burning, but 
a few adrenalin powered breaths, and I managed to blow them out.

Then the fire department showed up. They looked a bit skeptical when I told
them I managed to put out a fire that big with just 2l of iced tea;-)

My poor van! Two days ago it was stock, original parts, mint. Now it has a 
large blackened hole where all the plastic bits above the engine 
used to be. It didn't damage the body, and I assume the engine is still OK. 
However there are a lot of melted parts. Major Bummer!!!

If I am ever going to get it back on the road, I need both advice, and a
source of reasonabley priced used parts.
If there is anyone who has any of the parts listed below that they would 
be willing to sell, pleas e-mail me. Ideally what I'd like to find is someone
who has done a FI to carb conversion, and has the whole kit hanging around in a 
box?
I'd like to restore it to stock condition if I can without spending too much 
money. If I can't then I might have to convert it to carbs, but I don't want to.

Also does anyone -know- about compatibility of Fuel Injection parts between 
model years. If I can use parts form several years it will make them
easier to find, but I don't wnat to trash the computer with incompatible parts?

Parts needed for 1976 Type II 2.0l Fuel injected Canadian model (no catylitic 
convertor):

Needed to run?
- -Air Cleaner &quot;Nose&quot;
- -Air Cleaner Body
- -Air Cleaner Filter
- -Air Flow Sensor
- -Intake Air Duct to throttle body
- -Throttle Valve Switch
- -Cold Start Valve
- -Thermo Time Switch
- -Fuel Injection Wiring Harness
- -Complete set of all Fuel, Air, Vacuum hoses, and any &quot;T&quot; type fittings etc. 
 made of Plastic (are these pre-formed, or just permanently bent due to age?
- -Heater Fan 
- -Heater Fan connecting hoses
- -Heater Fan Right Side Plastic Duct to engine tin
- -Unknown Little Melted Relay that was mounted with heater fan?

Needed to complete restoration, or I can get one new locally. 
- -Foam type Engine Seal
- -Cooling Fan Screen
- -Engine Flap Weather Stripping
- -Rear Hatch Handle (Plastic Part)
- -Decel Valve
- -Distriutor Cap
- -Spark Plug wires Set.
- -Wiring harness that crosses back roof of engine compartment to the left
 tailight?

This was just a first pass inventory of things that I could no longer find, or
found the melted remanant of. I'm sure there are lots of other little bits.


Thanks for any help that can be offer to get Sunny Side Down back on the road.
