&gt;Does this mean that, from your experience, it is possible to replace the 
&gt;sender simply by tipping the tank out -- and not removing it completely? 
&gt;You could, for instance, leave the fuel lines connected?

I think if it were possible you would still have to disconnect the Vapor 
Lines on top and atleast create enough slack on the lines below. But IIRC, I 
don't think that would be possible either. Conflict between the lines, the 
inlet and outlet on the bottom of the tank and the opening they pertrude 
through will not allow the &quot;play&quot; you need to tip it.
