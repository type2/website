Subject: Re: hardtop westy ceiling

Hey, I've actually got one I pulled out of a 69 hdtp westy- it was in good 
shape when I pulled it out, but it's been beat up a bit since. It had the u- 
channel riveted to the sides and the chrome strips to cover the seams. I 
could send a pic of what I have, if it'll do you any good.I'm using the 
remains of the wood for my 61 westy.    Ed
