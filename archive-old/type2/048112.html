&gt; Okay, everyone...a friend of mine asked for the definition of FWEEM.  I
&gt; didn't really know how to explain it.  I would like to enlighten him.
&gt; 
&gt; I just thought I would try for some input from this fantastic group.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
&gt; Missy:)

If you have a Bug or a pre-72 Bus handy, both of you get in it, start the
car, and nail the gas. FWEEEEEEEEMMMMMM...
