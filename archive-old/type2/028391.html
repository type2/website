Shelby,
	 I went down this road awhile ago, All good fun. I imagined an alternator
in a tube and a long tubular-type fan in front of it and a scoop in front of
that... Good bearings and wiring later windcharge of the extra battery is
happening.

	Finally I didnt do that, I went to a computer auction and paid a very few
bux for an uninterruptible power supply. They are basically a car type
battery with a mains charger at one end and an inverter at the other. Take
out the inevitably expired battery inside and wire in your extra batt. in
the van. Wire the power input into to your campers mains wiring and whenever
you plug in at the park the battery charges. When you are away from power
you have a neat mains style alternative power supply. If you get a big one
and a serious battery, it will run a whole heap of mains voltage stuff.
lights, tools, allsorts.

&gt;
  ive read
&gt; occasional posts on charging extra batteries with
&gt; solar panels now and again.   lately i have been
&gt; surfing around looking up information on alternative
&gt; power in houses since i have a friend currently living
&gt; sans electricity and running water.   where the bus
&gt; related part comes in is.....i was wondering if anyone
&gt; has thought about &quot;wind power&quot; to charge a battery.
&gt; windmills can do a good job of supply electricity to a
&gt; home so why not some type of turbine, wind powered
&gt; generator on a bus.   driving down the road would
&gt; cause it to turn and could charge a couple batteries
&gt; for camp.   i do realize this would not work out so
&gt; well when camping but i was just brainstorming.   ill
&gt; stop rambling...
