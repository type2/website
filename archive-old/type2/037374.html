Shelby,

The earlier loafs had the hinge in the front. I don't remember what year
they changed, but apparently, Westfalia wasn't making enough money on
replacement tops from stupid owners (like me) who forgot to latch the tops
down before driving away, so they put the hinge in the back. This resulted
in instant income, and therefore became standard ;).

Another theory would be to put the upper luggage rack atop the driver,
thereby evening out the front/rear load.

Subject: pop top question(might be a dumb ?)


&gt; to the list,
&gt; this question was just posted to a yahoo vw club i am
&gt; a member of and it got me thinking.   i was wondering
&gt; if anyone could enlighten me on this:  the gentleman
&gt; asked why westy's have pop tops that raise forward as
&gt; well as rear facing.   is this a year specific thing,
&gt; or an option thing.   im just basically curious and
&gt; like to have useless knowledge to fill my head instead
&gt; of the important stuff.   if this is an obvious answer
&gt; ?, i apologize, ive got a riviera anyways:)
