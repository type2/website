Subject: Re: [T2] re: diesel bus?

Brian Verbeek says about my allegation that $5000 for a diesel Loaf
conversion is really, really expensive:

&gt; Well, if it is a professionally done installation, using only original VW
&gt; parts and a factory new engine. It is dirt cheap, and still less expensive
&gt; than the 1776 I built for my single cab.

The $5000 is parts only, Brian. You get to put it in yourself, or pay
someone to do it for you.
