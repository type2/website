&gt;I am having trouble mounting my rebuilt 1971 engine in
&gt;my 1970 camper.

!?!?  The only difference that matters for mounting is in the clutch.  Use a
clutch plate that has the three prongs to match the early trans.  Otherwise
it's a drop-in fit, dual-port tin and all.


&gt; I had a mechanic tell me he could
&gt;fabricate some motor mounts for it and it turned out
&gt;all he did was weld it in place.

Whoa-  is this FOR SURE a '71 engine?  Could it possibly be a '72 type4?
The '71 engine will not mate to the input shaft unless it butts right up to
the bellhousing, and if it accomplishes this feat then the rear hanger now
lines up with its mounts.

!!?!??!!?!?
