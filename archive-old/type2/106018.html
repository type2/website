&gt; Looking at my own bus it looks as if one set of flaps can be made that will
&gt; fit both front and back; IF the flaps are made so that the excess flap that
&gt; would get in the way installing them in the back could be easily identified
&gt; and removed by the DIY'er.  Maybe a cut line included as part of the design.
&gt; I'll try to locate a flap or two down here and see if it's a workable
&gt; project.
&gt; 
&gt; In your valued (blatant buttering up [grin]) opinion, do you think that
&gt; making the front and back flaps the same width (as your front flaps are)
&gt; will work for the back flaps?

Talking about the rear flaps:

I've seen two stock designs in pictures but know little about them. One is
straight from top to bottom. The other is tapered at the top. I figure the
top is the same width but the bottom is wider:

All mudflapped out...
