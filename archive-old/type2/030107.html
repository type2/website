&gt; You have to push down on the shifter when going into reverse. Try pushing
&gt; down while shifting down and to the left.

Well,

Actually, it's a three-step process.  Push down first (toward the ground),
then move the lever all the way to the left (toward the driver (in North
America [1])) then toward the front[2] of the bus.  It's position is
rather like first gear, but more to the left.

[1] In Britain (and other RHD countries) is the trans the same or is it
reversed with the steering wheel?

[2] back in a Vanagon, and it is like second, but left.
