Subject: oil into carb
Message-Id: &lt;v01510103b348f43edbad_at_[207.172.119.145]&gt;

I've just pulled the 1776 from my '71 Westy for the third time in twelve
months.  It was really gratifying to see that the only evidence of oil on
the outside of the engine was a bit coming from one of my push rod tube
doughnuts.  Everything else was dry.

However:  The tube on the oil filler pipe is plumbed into the intake tube
on one of the Kadrons.  Every time I have taken apart the engine,  this
pathway has been soaked with oil.  I now recall that the PO had a home made
1liter plastic bottle hanging in this path,  I now know to accumulate
liquid and pass on vapors.

My question:  What is the source of this oil and why is there so much of
it?  My understanding of blowby does not jibe with this oil problem.  This
is perhaps my tenth ac rebuild but my first non stock one. I've not had
this problem before.  The previous rebuild went well but a quart of oil
vanished in 100 miles.  Might be related to this.

Is the liquid oil slung up there?  If so, I thought that the louvered
gasket was to prevent this slinging.

Is oil vapor, perhaps generated in the sump by too high temperatures making
its way into this tube?


I'd appreciate any help.
Jack
