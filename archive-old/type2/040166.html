Subject: Re: What color is top of dash

Sorry I missed the beginning of this post - been away on &quot;training&quot; for work.

What I used was a piece of indoor/outdoor carpet - not the loopy kind, but 
the &quot;pile&quot; kind - with cutouts for the defroster vents.  No glare, and stuff 
doesn't slip and slide.

Hugs,
