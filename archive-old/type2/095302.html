Subject: What would YOU do?

Here's the scenario:

In rebuilding an engine (someone else's), I've come across a classic 
distributor dilemma.

Hers is a '71 dual vacuum, like the one in my bus. (I like them -- in fact, 
I pulled the new 009 off mine and installed a stock one, worn and decrepit 
but with &quot;triple fast action&quot; for the stock carb lover.)

So I go to clean off her diz and replace the electricals tonight and two 
things jump right out:

1) The vacuum advance doesn't work. Air leakage somewhere. Retard works.

2) The cam is really worn ... shaft is tight, though.

I can't, in good conscience and good business, put the old half-dead 
distributor back on this pretty new engine. It needs at least a vacuum can 
(maybe the nipple needs rebrazing? Anyway, vacuum leak no good). All I have 
to replace it with is a 009. Having established that I wouldn't put one on 
my bus, this is not my bus, in fact it's a bug and hey, the 009 is 
practically new. By the way it's a stock carb.

I do want her to be happy with this engine. With the 009 I worry about being 
able to dial in a low enough idle. What would you do?
