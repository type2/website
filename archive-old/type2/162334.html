Subject: gas tank swap?

Guys,

I'm finally getting round to doing some work on my 68 dbl cab and have 
pulled the gas tank out of it.

Ugghh...the outside bottom of the tank is waaay more rusty than I would 
like and I am worried about it pinholing when I get it boiled out.

Anyone know swap limits between busses and trucks?

I hoped that a tank from a bus between 68 and 71 would be the same?

Chris as Busted Bus has one out of a 71, but fitment is unknown for sure.

Cheers, dave
