&lt;&lt; Can this outside air duct be disconnected without ill effects and let the 
 inside engine compartment air be the sole intake source? 
 What about that little thermostatic valve, is it necessary in other than 
 freezing temps? &gt;&gt;

this preheat air intake system operates in different ways (depending on year 
of van) but generally has the same principles thru-out.  it provides not only 
heated air in the winter time for faster warm-ups.....but also allows the 
engine to run more lean on full high way driving and more rich on full 
throttle poundings.  on mine, my thermostatic control flap is only vacuum 
operated.  when at full throttle this flap closes to only let in regular 
outside air.  the principle is that colder air holds more fuel/is more 
rich....thus by closing the flap (shutting off the intake of heated air) you 
suck in the regular outside air.    on the other hand when driving down the 
road _at_ 1/2  throttle or so ( normal steady speed)...the flap remains 
partially open to full open (depending on engine vacuum, in my case).  thus 
heating the air into the carbs.  heated air holds less fuel...thus better 
fuel econamy etc.  pound the gas again the flap closes and no more heated 
air.........hope that makes a little sense.
