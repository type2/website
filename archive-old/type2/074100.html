Subject: Re: [T2] What part is it?

The sump plate  is for a fuel pump to run off the camshaft I guess. 
I've never had a Canadian, European version of the 1800/2000cc so I just
venture my guess.

&gt; That plate is called a sump plate. It has two copper washers under 
&gt; the two mounting screws and a big O ring under the plate. Drain your 
&gt; engine oil before you remove this plate.
