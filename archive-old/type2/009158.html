HI,

This is cross posted for safety reasons.

As the weather has been warming, my comcerns about engine cooling have
become more acute. It was time to replace that tattered engine compartment
seal in the '69. This is an easy matter in the '72 but would require an
engine pull for the upright in the '69. I enlisted the aid of local
listmember John Staincamp to quide me thru this procedure and and to  look
for the proverbial red herrings. I am glad that I did.

The yanking of the motor was, as I expected, a helluva lot easeir than
coaxing the pancake outta the '72.  The only real sticking point was getting
the fuel line clamped off. In fact John got quite a dowsing :( Further
inspection revealed very hard and cracked fuel line from the tank to fromt
tin. THIS IS BAD!!!!!!!!! I cannot estimate how close I may have been to
going up in flames but I am sure that it was coming soon. Please, if you
have been putting off inspection or replacement of fuel lines for another
day, don't; DO IT TODAY! I have seen buses that have burned to the ground
and it is sad.  &lt;end rant here&gt;

In order to correctly install the engine compartment seal it was necessary
to remove the remains of the old one. That proved to be more work than
expected. The old seal was rotten and torn. It had to be scraped and
&quot;chiseled&quot; out with a flat-head screwdriver. The tracks that hold the seal
were then cleaned woth WD-40 and som rags. The last step was to straighent
the tracks up a little. The had been bent during previous engine pulls I
guess.

There are 3 parts to the seal. The front(front is front of bus) seal is more
or less a straight piece that was a perfect fit. The other two pieces needed
some triming. We installed a piece in the valence and trimed the ends off so
that it stuck out about 3/8&quot; to account for future shrikage. We also trimmed
it at a 45drg angle so it would  lap over the next section. There are two
tracks that run parallel to the heads. We trimmed the straight parts of the
extra seal an inserted those making the same cuts as on the valence. 

Now for the fun part: A ride to the parts store in Johns '61 double cab.
That was the highlight of the day!!!!! We returned to his place and redid
all the fuel lines and added some exrta hose clamps where there had been
none. John did a little hammering on the bent front tin and in the motor
went. After it was plugged in we had to fuss with the seals over the heads
some more but no real problems. 

John pointed out that I was missing some tin that goes around the heat riser
tubes where they come thru the tin. These are the least piece of the cooling
puzzle. I have looked thru some catalogs but have not turned anything up
yet. If you have em and want to get rid of them of know where they are
available., let me know.

THANKS to John for spending the day with another listmember and helping me
out. I learned a lot and now I can help myself and maybe someone else down
the road. Buses have a way of doing that to people :)&gt;
