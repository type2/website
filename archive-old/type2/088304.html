Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump/FI question of the day 

&gt; So, you see, I am reaching for straws, and the solution might be getting
&gt; those female push-on connectors on the correct blades at the
&gt; starter......or not.  So I'm asking. Is there any difference between the
three?

Doyt,
I've never seen a solenoid with 3 male push-on connectors.  Most have 2 and
the new Bosch Mexican starters that Bus Depot sells only has one (so you
have to piggyback for FI).

It sounds from your description like one of the wires is on the same circuit
as the wire from the ignition switch and one is not.  I would bet that the
one where you say it starts easier is the one on the circuit, but this would
be very easy to verify with a voltmeter.  Crawl under while a helper sits in
the driver's seat (DOUBLE VERIFY THAT THE TRANSMISSION IS IN NEUTRAL AND THE
PARKING BRAKE IS ON AND THE HELPER'S FOOT IS ON THE CLUTCH PEDAL AT ALL
TIMES).  Put your voltmeter on each spade connector as your helper turns the
key to start and see which one gives you 12v.  That's the one you want to
hook the FI wire to.


&gt; Maybe there is a third wire that ISN'T present but should be, to go on one
&gt; of those available male connectors.

No, I don't think so but you can always verify with the wiring diagram.  As
far as I know there should only be the 2 push-on wires and of course the big
wires with the ring connectors that go on that post.
