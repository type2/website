Subject: Insurance Questions

Hey guys,

	I was curious what some of you guys use to insure your VW
Transporters. I currently use Geico. Right now, it's costing me about $170
dollars a month to insure 3 cars, my 1997 GrandAm, my 87 Pontiac Fiero, and
my 73 VW Transporter. The Fiero only costs me an additional $30 dollars a
month, the GrandAm costs me only $55 dollars a month, but the VW Transporter
costs me $85 dollars a month. It seems a bit pricey. The lady on the phone
said that because my VW Transporter is soo unsafe, they charge a higher
insurance rate. I even told her I had front wheel disc brakes, but she said
it didn't matter because they didn't have ABS. My Fiero doesn't have ABS,
but Geico seems to think it's a safer car than my 4 cyl GrandAm Sedan? She
even went so far as to say.. &quot;Are you SURE you want to insure it??&quot;

Do any of you guys use separate car insurance companies to insure your VWs
or special cars? I'm just wondering if it might not be worth it for me to
switch.
