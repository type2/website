frank-
you have a type 2 body, correct.
the engine is a 2000cc type 4 if it is stock.
in '75 they were given fuel injection, and
in '76 they were 2000cc displacement until
'83 when the vanagon went water-cooled
(vw's folley  :-(
ok, here is a good history of the type 4 engine in busses.
it was first brought to the bus in '72 as a
1700cc with dual solex carbs.
in '74 it became an 1800cc with carbs.
in '75 it was given Bosch L-jetronic fuel injection. and in '76 it was 2000cc
until
'83.

&gt; I have a 78 Westy, 2.0 L engine w/FI. The reference to &quot;type*&quot; has me somewhat
&gt; confused. I believe I have a type2 body style w/ a typeIV engine. Is this
&gt; correct? What is the difference between a Type2 and TypeIV engine? This may be
&gt; elementary to this knowledgeable list , but is confusing to me.
&gt; Thanks for the help.
