&gt; there was a guy named Beckett, who was a double E for Exide Battery,
&gt; that really helped to explain how the whole aux. battery set up worked...
&gt; He came to your defense, and really made sense, at least to us laymen.
&gt; Do you still have his archived post address?


Yes. This is great info for anyone contemplating a dual battery setup. It
explains how the stock VW setup (and my $18.95 Hella kit) works, and why
they designed it that way.  This guy was great at taking a very technical
issue and making it easy for anyone to understand.   Here is the link to his
posts:
