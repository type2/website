Well, I finally registered my 74 camper on Easter thursday. It has been
running more or less for a while and after all the usual sitting for a year
or two trauma, but now it is singing. I bought it from a breaker who had it
in his yard and was hallucinating about going to Sydney for the Olympics in
it, that fell through and I snatched it for a thousand Aust$. Not much
really. (NO rust you see) Good Sopru camper conversion fridge, bed, sink,
all the stuff. Sopru was a European carpenter and did these very nicely in
South australia. Three cylinder motor no extra charge. I replaced the motor
after a comp test.  The dead motor is nice and dry outside. I will store it
and rebuild the top end for later. Got a good second hand motor from a mate.
Lean into the drivers window, and flick the key, listen carefully and its
idling away. (Not dead cold of course.)
	I replaced the seats with some from a Nissan Bluebird, difficult to find
some low enough on the seat. These are good, lumbar and lateral support. Low
enough to retain the runners, so all adjustable, mmmmm.
	I left the motor bog stock and replaced seals etc. Nice and reliable
theory.
Carpeted under the seat/bed and can now hardly hear the motor as I go along.
That was worth doing. Now I must instrument it well as no motor info comes
through the noise.
	Got grunt gas shocks from a donor van and it goes around very tidy.
	Off again today,(500 miles since thurs.) to brothers for a barbeque. He has
a land cruiser and thinks I must be mad. I suspect his soul was removed as a
child.
	Pics of the process etc. up soon. Having fun.
