Subject: Re: [T2] Sound deadening...

I have read on the Samba from people with plenty of experience that it is their opinion that you should sound deaden against wind and road noise and rattles but leave your engine audible so you can hear if you have a problem, each to his own but I thought I would share this little piece of advice, if I deaden my engine compartment I will do it last, that way I will have quieted everything else and can hear the engine still even after trying to quiet it.
