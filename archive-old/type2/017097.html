     Never, ever, sand contact points. You have to use a file (and a
nail file will work in a pinch, albiet slowly) or a stone. Sandpaper
leaves a glue residue on the points. You can buy a nice little file made
especially for points, and do them right in the dizzy, or take them out
and use almost any big file with a flat surface.
