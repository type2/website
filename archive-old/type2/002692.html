Sadly, because I am moving from a house with an enormous two-car
garage/workshop to an apartment with a puny single car garage, I must place
my bus in long-term storage. Any tips on what to do what not to do? Does
Stabil fuel stabilizer work for periods of up to a year or longer? How am I
going to keep the damn rodents out?
