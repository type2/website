&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Looking at 185's vs. 195's on Tires for my 71
&gt; &gt; Westy (1600cc).......Got the
&gt; &gt; right tire it's just a matter of what width..
&gt; &gt; There are 185's on the bus
&gt; &gt; now...Thoughts , draw backs ????
&gt; 
&gt; well for a little more stability and better (IMO) handling you could 
use
&gt; 205/70R14 tires...they are almost identical in outside diameter to 
the
&gt; stock 185/14 tires that are stock.

One other thing to think about is that early bays have the worm-and-
peg steering box that is weaker than the later worm-and-roller box.  
Unfortunately, the two boxes do not interchange.  My theory is that 
the increased steering effort of the radial tires over the original 
narrow bias ply tires caused more steering box failures, prompting the 
change.  For this reason, I've resisted the urge to go to wider tires 
on my '71.  If you do make the switch, make sure you are moving before 
steering to reduce stress on the peg.
