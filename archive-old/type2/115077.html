&gt; Along the way, I noticed that the fuel pump turns on when the key is

&gt; I'm tempted to cut this wire to restore stock operation. On the other
&gt; hand, the car has been running this way for a year.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone suggest a reason that I should remove this &quot;feature&quot;?

Safety? Also, the chances of you getting &quot;lucky&quot; and springing a leak you'll
notice while the engine isn't running is remote.

Why run the pump when you don't have to? Fuel line pressure will build to 36
psi then return to the tank.

Find out why the wire was added. Someone was smart enough to know to wire it
there so they may not be a complete DPO after all.
