It sounds like you are running some sort of aftermarket sender unit.  If so, 
it may simply be set to go off at the wrong pressure.

I remember reading that the sender units on some of the cheaper gauge sets 
are not specifically designed for your VW's engine.  They are a &quot;generic&quot; 
unit set to activate the dash light at a different threshold than the stock 
sender.
