Subject: [T2] Heater questions

Hey All!!  Regarding auxilary Eberspacher (sp?) gas heaters.  Are these self-contained heaters that use their own gas supply or do you have to hook them into the existing gas line on your bus??  Also, if anyone has installed one of these in your bus (I have a '75) how much of a pain in the anus is it???  I love my bus, but I'm freezing my _at_#$%&amp; off!
