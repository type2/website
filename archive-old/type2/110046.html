Subject: Re: [T2] POR 15

From: &quot;Darren Evans-Young&quot; &lt;darren_at_bama.ua_dot_edu&gt;
&gt; Is their rust prevention stuff ok?

Darren,
If the directions on the POR15 can are utilized and all the steps followed
correctly the POR will last a LONG time.  I used it on a few spots on my bus
at least 3 years ago and no signs of any rust through or advancement at all.
If I didn't know where it was I wouldn't be able to tell.

Hope this helps.. Be careful if you use it though as it stains your skin and
DOES NOT come off with anything but time...

Peace Brother,
Snoopy
