Subject: Re: [T2] Head/Tin Question

&gt; Ok, I've run into a slight problem with the rebuild of my 2.0. The first
 question... are the heads basically the same? Meaning can I put them on
 either side of the engine? The reason I ask this is I've put the heads on
 the engine and now am trying to put the deflector tin that screws onto the
 case and the heads and I can't get the screw holes to align. I figure this
 could be either because I have the heads on backwards (but the appear to the
 same even if I did switch) or I'm just screwing something up. So did I blow
 my 50-50 shot at putting the right head on the right side or do I just have
 to try a little harder to align the holes? 79 Westy

The only difference between left and right is the temp sensor hole at #3 cylinder. It seems that all
replacement heads are lefts so you can put a left head on the right side. But the factory right head does not
have the large sensor hole, it is just a tin screw hole.
