&gt;         At startup, the engine must create oil pressure from none at all,

&gt; possible.  The addition of lengths of tubing to some other location,

This is why you use a thermostat and place said thermostat intimately
close to the engine, such that you only minimally increase the length
the oil flows until it is warmed.  In the ideal and perfectly harmless
intallation, you mount the thermostat in a block between the filter
flange and filter.  Automotion may carry such an adapter for 914's or
I know they are sold for the FWD VW's that use the same flange, would
in fact allow you some extra grip on the filter during changes as well.
The thermostat flange jobby is like $100-$150 if I recall though, not
for the faint of wallet, but if you are going to do it right.  The one
I recall has like AN6 or AN8 fittings out, ready for quality hydraulic
grade installation.
