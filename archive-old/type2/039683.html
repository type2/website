Subject: Friday type question about Propane gas tank

I have a Devon conversion and my propane gas tank lines in a cupboard under
the sink just in front of the rear seat.  I am thinking of making the bed
full width, and need to move the tank (it's 29 inches high). Things I have
seen/thoughts I have had are

Leave it where it is but shorten the cabinet so the bed pulls over it (just
about fits)
Get a smaller propane tank
Use a petrol (Gas) burning stove (heard this is not a good idea)
Put the tank in the engine compartment??????? (I once saw a bus with this)
Cut a round hole where the spare wheel sits in the reaer shelf and construct
a compartmant to &quot;drop&quot; it into
Put it outside when I use the bed. (just like a caravan (trailer))

Any (postable) suggestions, where is your tank?

Thanks
