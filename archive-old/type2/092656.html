Subject: Re: [T2] Compression Check question

&gt;I want to check the compression on a 1600 DP engine I have that is NOT
&gt;installed in a bus right now. My question is: Can I do a compression check by
&gt;turning the engine over by hand on the generator pulley or does it need full
&gt;cranking speed from a starter to get an accurate reading?

You need the starter to do a compression test. Just no way to turn the 
motor fast enough by hand to get good data. You could do a leak down test 
which will tell you more than a compression test. This will tell you not 
only quality of sealing, but where any weakness may be, whether valves or rings.
