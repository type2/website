Subject: Re: Stereo Wiring

There is a wire from the ignition switch that must likely has been cut.  I 
believe it is gray (my Bentley wiring diagram shows it as brown).  This is a 
ground that makes contact when the key is in the ignition.  It can be wired 
opposite a hot (always) wire on a relay/solenoid that can activate a hot wire 
going to your stereo.  That way, you have current going to your stereo when 
the key is in the ignition, but as soon as you pull it out, that current goes 
dead.

It seems like it would work in theory, and it seems like I saw this idea 
posted on the list before, but I have not tried it myself.  Anyone?  Who was 
the original &quot;poster?&quot;
