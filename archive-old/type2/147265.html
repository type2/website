Subject: Re: [T2] Why would points wear abnormally fast?

Jay,

Verify that the coil polarity is correct. Reversed polarity here can 
cause points to wear prematurely.

&gt;   The points that we pulled out were pitted and looked pretty bad.  
&gt; Could this be a wiring issue where the points are burning out?  Could 
&gt; this be keeping the acc position on and wearing the points?
&gt;    Anything else you can think of???
