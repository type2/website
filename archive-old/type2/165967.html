Tuesday. NO LATER!!!


All shirts will be GILDAN quality white cotton Ts,either Mens, Ladies  
or Childs.  Shirts will cost $15CDN for on-site pickup, or  
approximately $26-$30 for mail order with shipment tracking.See this  
page for more details:

ALSO NOTE: BOTC Pre-registration ends August 1st, so you have only 1  
more days to save $5 and pre-register for the biggest Bus-Camping  
event in Southern Ontario this August!
