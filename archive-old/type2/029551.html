&gt; Having said that, the bus needs a thorough check-up and reliable engine. If

&gt; I would say you need to allow for at least 2 to 4 weeks running the car
&gt; around town before sending them off.

Running around town is one of the worst ways to break in an engine.
Repeated hot/cold cycles and rapid speed changes aren't good to new
running surfaces.

Better to take a 300-mile shakedown cruise around your point of origin and
you'll never be more than 75 miles or more of home.

I didn't take that advice when I put in my new engine.  We headed out to
BBBIV directly!  :)  300 miles of California Desert without a hiccup!
