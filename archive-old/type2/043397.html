Subject: transmission help needed

I want to build a custom transmission for my 1971 bus (if I keep it... 
currently for sale but no good offers).

It will have a 1914cc motor, or a 2221cc motor (I own two).

What should I tell the builder (besides motor displacement) that I would 
like or that may help him. Someone once before mention wheel size ??? And a 
1976 or later case ???

You know stuff like this.



Mykl and
Rusty (71 Westfalia)
