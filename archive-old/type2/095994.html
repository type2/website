Subject: Re: [T2] popping from webers

PS&gt; i have an 009 and it works great with my set up&gt;&gt;

1800ccdual port w/dual 40mm weber idfs and an 009 dizzy...

once i reset the carbs it has run better than it everhas since i bought it 
almost 2 years ago...

(i had the same problem no matter what, i always checked the valves, 
timing and everything was good but the sneezing and popping wouldn't go 
away...)
