&gt; I am thinking of buying one and would like to know if these things work or
&gt; not. It would be an expensive experiment.

I have no experience with these, but here's some general info:

Swamp coolers work great in dry air.  Let the humidity go over 50% and
they don't work.

Swamp coolers need a constant supply of outside air to work properly.  If
you recirculate cabin air all you will do is humidify the hot air.

I think that one spray bottle per passenger would be a much more practical
solution.  :)
