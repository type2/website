Listees - 

Normally I wouldn't post this to the list, but my
surfing efforts have yielded nought up to this point.
I would like to find a website that describes the
process of heat shrinking warped metal in detail. My
71s rear quarter needs this, and I'd like to have some
idea how it's done before I go at it. I do have basic
torch welding skills, but this seems like another
order of beast.

TIA

Tom
