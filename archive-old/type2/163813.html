Subject: Re: [T2] Pushrod tube seals

&gt; &gt;Right now I am losing about a quart of oil every 2-400 miles.  So
&gt; &gt;while not an amount I can't keep ahead of, its more than I am
&gt; &gt;comfortable with since an oil covered engine tends to collect dirt
&gt; &gt;which affects cooling efficiency.
&gt;
&gt; That seems a lot for push rod tubes but the valve covers do see a lot of oil while the engine is running.

I agree, its only really a problem when its running as when it sits,
there are no leaks(except from the oil dripping down from the tin)  I
may also be exaggerating on my oil losses.  More like a quart over the
last 3 tanks.  Theres enough oil dripping that I have little oil spots
on the back of the bus from the turbulence.  Either way, I am going to
attempt the replacement without pulling the motor as I don't really
have a suitable place to do that.  Then I will degrease the engine and
monitor the situation further.  Its a good engine and I would like to
make it last as long as possible.  At least theres lots of fresh oil
in there :-)
