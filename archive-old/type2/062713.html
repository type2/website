Subject: Re: Getting off Lug Nuts (was: Helping a Fellow Vw'er)

&gt;The owner of the VW shop I used to work at showed me a trick. Take the
biggest hammer
&gt;you can find and hit the lug nut square on the face two or three times
before you try
&gt;to break it loose.  This always worked for me.

A sears Craftsman (replace at any Sears) breaker bar and socket, my foot and
the rest of me on top of it,  have been enought to get off all the lug nuts
I've tried. Mind you I have had to bounce on the end of the bar a time or two.
Good luck all.
