&gt; After seeing all this talk about hot engines, missing tin and engine
&gt; compartment seals, that brought up a question that's been bouncing around
&gt; in my head for awhile.

Replacing the engine seal, at least for me, was neither too time-consuming nor
difficult .. pull the old seal out (you may have to alternate over and under
the motor to get it all), then make sure you get as much leftover residue,
scraps, etc. off the tin as possible.  Start in the front middle (front is
front) next to the gas tank and start working the seal into the crack; what
worked for me was to pinch the bottom edges together and slide them both into
the crack at the same time, then push with my fingers on the middle of the seal
to get the bottom edges to spread back out underneath.  You should be able to
work most of the seal into place from above, then move underneath to make sure
the seal is spread evenly and not pinched anywhere.  Trim excess length so the
ends are snug and you're done.  Remember, the smooth, coated side of the seal
faces down so it can repel oil, etc.  Have fun  :o)
