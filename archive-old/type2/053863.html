I talked to the manager of my local Checker about air shocks. He said they
only sell them for the Beetle. But  after looking them up and comparing they
are the same dimensions for the Bus except for one part which he said could
be cut off. After he said cut, I wasn't paying attention. Now I'm
reconsidering. They weren't too pricey either -$65.00 +if I remember.
Does anyone out there have a pair on their Beetle that they could compare
for the Bus?

&gt; Anybody out there have any luck with air shocks? I don't have a t-bar
&gt; problem, but I haul an absolutly amazing amount of crap around on a daily
&gt; basis for work.&lt; I do custom marble and tile installation, kitchens,
&gt; bathrooms, mantles etc...&gt; and when I'm fully loaded, it really shows on
the
&gt; suspension of my ' 79 bus. I seem to remember that these suckers are rated
at
&gt; 3/4 ton, but when I get close to that, my suspension is pretty much
hitting
&gt; the stops. When I'm unloaded, everything is groovy, no butt droop or
&gt; anything, and I was thinking that maybe air shocks or a good set of coil
&gt; overs would help me out. Anyone ever try this, or am I just stuck with
&gt; keeping my load far below the rating of the bus?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Jack Merrick
