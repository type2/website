Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum leak?

Daniel
what you've most likely have is a vacuum leak, in your case, as you say its
on the right under the generator, a likely suspect is the boot that connects
the dp manifold.
What your looking for is to spray contact cleaner and have the rpms drop.
You want to spray it at a likely joint. ie if you spray it where the
manifold connects to the head and the rpm drops, then your air leak is at
that joint. The repair is to take it apart and replace the offending
gasket.More to the point, clean the two mateing surfaces, check for trueness
of the parts, reassemble with new gaskets and sealer.In your case, if its
the intake manifold half, be prepared to drop the engine. I'm sure someone
has done it in situ, but with a 71, the aggrevation just aint worth it.

&gt; Howdy Volks
&gt; Finally getting around to see why my 71 westy 1600DP was running rough.
What
&gt; it was doing was SERIOUS hesitation upon acceleration. It was doing it for
a
&gt; while, then was fine for a while, now back to bad. Ayway, did the usual
&gt; valve adjust/check head torque. So I started her up and it was rough on
the
&gt; idle. It would idle low then kind of rev on its own, then go back to a
rough
&gt; ticking (not valve ticking, but another kind) then rev then tick, then
&gt; afterr about 60 seconds or so idle, but idle high (maybe 1200rpm).Checked
&gt; dwell (52degress, just on the high side but should be ok) when I went onto
&gt; checking timing. ok at idle (recheked statically later - ok) but when I
went
&gt; to check timing at advance by pulling the throttle it would cut out. As
soo
&gt; as I started pulling the throttle I would hear a loud whooshing - much
like
&gt; lettin the air out of something. So sounds to me like an exhaust leak. It
&gt; sounded like it was coming from the right side, maybe under the generator.
&gt; So..from what I've read I can spray carb cleaner to see if it idles higher
&gt; (or more or less normal). But what do I spray it on? And if I find
&gt; something, what do I do? (I suppose that depends where it is, duh) Any
&gt; suggestions as to:
&gt; 1. where this might be occuring?
&gt; 2. techniques for diagnosing?
&gt; 3. possible solutions for different possible problems?
&gt; 4. am I on the right track here?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks mucho
&gt; wink
