Subject: RE: [T2] replacing doglegs on on a 76 

&gt; i have owned my bus for about 5 years now. And again this is 
&gt; the second time i have to replace my dog legs so i ordered a 
&gt; pair from cip1.When i got them in the mail they were from 2 
&gt; different manufactors the frist was named art who is in 
&gt; brazil and the second is klokkerholm which i figure is in 
&gt; germany. Does anybody know anthing about theses comapnies is 
&gt; one better than the other metal wise.


Klokkerholm is Danish - they bought Veng's tooling when Veng (also
Danish) folded a couple of years ago. Their 68-up sheet metal is
generally pretty good, not as good as the genuine VW stuff (which is in
fact Brazilian, yet better than the Klokkerholm, but hard to get) but
close.  The notable exceptions are Klokkerholm's splitty sheet metal,
and their '73-79 nose, which are for the most part Brazilian anyway, but
more expensive because they made the trip from Brazil to Denmark to the
U.S. 

As for the Brazilian one you got, I can't say I'm familiar with &quot;Art,&quot;
but apparantly it's not the genuine VW one. Klokkerholm prices have been
going up recently, so perhaps the retailer was looking to save some
money and brought in some aftermarket Brazilian stuff instead.  I guess
you'll have to try to judge it based on how it looks as compared to the
Klokkerholm one. It's not a &quot;name brand,&quot; but who knows.

I try to ship the highest quality metal whenever possible; welding in
new metal is just too much work to use anything less. I rarely sell
aftermarket Brazilian '68-up sheet metal except as a last resort (in
cases where nothing else is available). I try to ship the genuine VW
stuff whenever possible but it's hard to get.  At the moment, my genuine
VW metal includes some complete '73-up wheel arches, rear corners, and
left battery trays, and I have some genuine VW front doors on the way.
Some of my other metal is made by AH Schofield in the UK, which is also
exceptional quality. The rest is just about all Klokkerholm, with
virtually no aftermarket Brazilian (the notable exception being the
front nose, which is actually pretty decent).  

Incidentally, expect the Klokkerholm stuff to go up in price
significantly over the next few months. Their wholesale prices have
skyrocketed. The only thing keeping the prices down for now is that
there is still some old inventory out there.
