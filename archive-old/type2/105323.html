Subject: Re: [T2] heater boxes

Joey:

You don't really say just what difficulties you're having, but I know from
experience that getting those things back on can be a chore.  If you're
working on your back in the driveway this is one of those places where
having a friend (one of the most incredibly useful tools you can have)
who'll help can smooth things out considerably.  The boxes are fairly heavy
and the studs in the head and the holes in the flanges tend to not want to
line up.

Unless you resort to bending studs or enlarging holes (not advised) the only
way to do it is to just *barely* get the studs into the holes on one flange,
giving you maximum adjustability on the other end.  Then you go over to the
other side and with a little persuasion and a little wiggling, just *barely*
get the other studs in their holes.  Then smoothly push up evenly, maybe
banging things a bit to encourage progress.

Subject: [T2] heater boxes


&gt; is there a trick to getting the heater boxes back onto the head??? I have
&gt; tried for almost an hour and I can not get it on. Ive tried wd40, and some
&gt; emery paper to smooth things out but i just cant get it back on. Is it
just
&gt; going to take more time or is there some trick that someone knows. I have
a
&gt; 72 bus and the engine is in. Anyone have any tips?? Or if i just cant get
it
&gt; back on, is there some alternative to the heater boxes?? I know that type1
&gt; engines have j-tubes, do the type4 engines have something like that??
Thanks
&gt; for any support you guys can give me.
