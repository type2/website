Subject: Re: [T2] I Smell Gas Fumes on Mountain Passes

And don't forget that in the mountains you are probably rounding alot of 
curves that causes the gasoline in the tank to slosh and leak out any leaky 
vent lines and filler necks.

Mine was doing just that here in curvy TN.

I replaced everything rubber and all was well again.

Ciao!
