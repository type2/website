&gt; Or do you use two for freshly built engines?

Tom,

Sorry for the confusion. You always use three shims for the completed motor.

You use two for the measuring procedure.

Here is the procedure the way I learned it:

Take any two good shims, and install flywheel with those two shims. Measure
end float. Subtract 0.003-0.005&quot; from the measured end float and that is the
size of the needed third shim. Remove flywheel and install third shim of
appropriate size. Depending on your supply of shims on hand you may need to
do this a few times to get the right combo, or you may have to order a shim
of the right size if you can't make it work with what you have. The shim
sizes are available online.
