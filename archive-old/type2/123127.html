&gt; Jamie: IMHO, it is a way to make your bus a much better camper. It is really
&gt; nice to be able to stand up, it adds a lot to the camping experience.

&gt; Will it look better? Aieee, it took me a while to be able to stand the sight
&gt; of my bus with that upside down boat on top of it. I even took the top off
&gt; once for about a week, and contemplated filling the hole in with a tonneau
&gt; 
&gt; As I told you before, there's been times where I've wished I had a hardtop
&gt; camper. Less wind resistance, sealed to wind and rain, actually fit into
&gt; garages, etc. Tough choice all around, not sure what I'd do either.

of course the other option is to lower the floor between the wheels, one
can stand in my bus (if your not too tall) but the roof is stock height.

of course I then go and put a boat upside down on it anyway, but at least
I can take it off and go fishing.....
