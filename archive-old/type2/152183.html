Subject: Re: [T2] removing dash

see it is like this, yesterday I'm driving in the driving rain when the
windshield wiper just stops! nothing, no warning nada......figured a fuse
blew and I'm only a couple blocks from home I just drive on slowly.  today
I get out there and &quot;nope not the fuse&quot;  test here test there and
basically find that the #_at_$%&amp;* thing is dead or at least deader than I
can mess with inside the car.
 so rummage around in the debris pit I call a garage and find my spare
windshield wiper assembly and test it, works perfectly so out comes the
old one and in goes the new one..(with appropriate application of German
and English expletives as needed)

but to make a long story short I discover while doing this that the lower
lip of my windshield is pretty rough shape.. now I know you can buy them
and I'm a fair to middling weldor but the question is how hard is it to
pull an 78 dashboard far enough away from the metal to not burn the bus
down with the MIG welder... don't need to change out anything just need to
not burn up my dash....of course I need to take out the glass, I already
have new rubber for that..but have never actually changed a windshield.

if anyone has done this before and has some hints' I am more than willing
to pick your brain....

thanks

Bob
