Have it re-done to the Bently specs for your van...... the suspension on the vanagon front end is completly diferent than the 79 vans.....    it would be
pretty comparable to them trying to align your 79 to the specs of a chev van..........

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I just had an alignment done on my '79 Camper at NTB. Though I gave them the Bentley for the specs, they used their computer's Vanagon settings (80-92).
&gt; Are the specs close enough or should I insist on having it redone according to Bentley specs?
&gt; It does not pull or anything but it does not feel totally right, either.
&gt; BTW, the alignment was done after a complete front end overhaul (new beam, balljoint, steering pin, and tie rod ends).
