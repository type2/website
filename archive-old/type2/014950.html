Subject: Pop top addition?
Mime-Version: 1.0

We're contemplating converting our new '72 Bus into a camper.  We have a
line on a '75 Westy that we can part out.  Installing the interior should
not be that difficult, but what about the pop top?  I obviously will have
to hack out a gaping hole in the roof of our '72, but are there any
reinforcements needed?  Did they reinforce the bodies or frames at all when
making the Westies?

I'm also assuming that a '75 pop top (hinge in the back) will fit a '72
Bus, which would have had a front hinging top.  Is that correct?

Has anyone out there done this sort of conversion before?  Any tips or
suggestions?

Thanks,
Dave
