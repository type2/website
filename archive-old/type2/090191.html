&gt; &gt;They have specialized equipment, such as EDM machines that can literally
&gt; &gt;disintegrate the offending stud.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;they generally prefer to see the part before the EZ-out is embedded in it,
&gt; &gt;though.

&gt; I wonder why George. If I had invested big bucks in an EDM machine I would
&gt; love to see EZ-outs dug in deep Monday thu Friday.


The machine works easier on a material without voids.  It will work on an
EZ-out, but it's more work for the machinist.

Also, it is often possible for a machinist to remove a broken stud without
using the EDM machine, which is much less time-consuming.
