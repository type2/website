Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny fluid

Oh kind and gracious Listees,
Please disregard my previous post asking where to get GL4. I have finally
been able to get my 28.8k connection up and checked the archives. Thanks to
Stephen on May of 2000, I got my answer. I always seem to forget about NAPA
because there is not one close by, however, they have the fluid in GL4 only.
Thanks and please forgive me for not checking the archives before I posted
my question. (I guess I like the slow things in life, 28.8 modems, VW Buses,
etc.)
Thanks,
Jim
