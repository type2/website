&gt; Speaking of which, I have a set of Westlake tires on my '71 in 185R14C.
&gt; That size isn't mentioned in the list of recalled tires for this
&gt; manufactuerer, but I think that it would still be wise to avoid this
&gt; brand.  I'll see how mine do across the Mojave in a couple of weeks.

   Don't bet on a replacement tire...Foreign Tire Service is a seven man
operation and will be in bankruptcy long before any tires get replaced... ;-(
