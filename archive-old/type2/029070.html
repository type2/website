Hi All,

My wife is giving me a guilt trip about owning a bus instead of a 2002 =
vehicle, so I'm regrettably letting it go. This is the nicest original =
late model bus I've ever owned or seen for that matter. I'm the second =
owner of this '72 7 Passenger Station Wagon. I bought it from a nice old =
guy named Burt Young who purchased it new from Hegeman VW in St. Louis =
County. Burt drove it on the weekends till about 1983 when the engine =
gave out. He took it in and didn't like the price quote for a new Type =
IV engine, so he opted for a used Type 1. Whoever did it for him didn't =
do it the best possible way and it was then put up in his garage till =
this summer. I then purchased it from Burt and replaced the engine with =
an all new 1641cc. The previous engine wasn't mounted correctly and the =
engine compartment wasn't sealed off properly. So I modified some engine =
mounts from a pre-71 bus and bought a custom engine filler panel from =
Creative Car Craft in Florida -- =
http://www.creativecarcraft_dot_com/notforbug.htm ...It worked out quite =
nicely and thus has been properly converted to Type 1 power. So now, =
pretty much, the only difference between this bus and a '71 is the tail =
lights. It has a rebuilt stock carb and a new .009 with electronic =
ignition. Also all new fuel lines, exhaust, fuel filter, chrome air =
filter, tires, brake shoes plus other miscellaneous stuff.

This bus is so well preserved, I almost cried when I found it. It has =
the original paint (2 tone: Chianti Red and Cream White) and very shiny. =
There is some paint chips and a slight parking lot ding (no paint =
broken). There is some surface rust up in the rain gutters that I'm =
going to fix before it gets sold. It still has the original dealership =
label on the back near the VW badge. The interior (white) is original =
and phenomenal, there is a slight bit of surface rust under the driver's =
floor mat, everything else is flawless. Everything electrical is =
perfect......I'm using the word &quot;perfect&quot;. The front end is tight as =
ever, it could use some rear shocks though, they're a little squeaky.

I'm asking $5,000 for it. This is exactly how much I have into it. The =
engine and all work was professionally done by Motor Cars of St. Louis. =
Email or call for pictures.
