Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] RE: Calif. &amp; Ariz. Emissions Laws - What's
  the latest?

&gt; If I correctly recall, the current California law stipulates that vehicles
&gt; 1973 and older.  The portion of that law also stipulates that the 30 years
&gt; and older exemption requirement doesn't go into effect until January 1,
&gt; 2004.  I will try to dig through my archives to get a copy of the
&gt; legislation and post it on my website.

Not correct. I answered this the other day with a link to the BAR newsletter. Here it is again:
[READ the next to last question on page 3]

&quot;&gt; &gt;It's been 1973 and older for a couple years.  The 30 years and older
&gt; &gt;fully kicks in this year so in 2004 it will be 1974 and older.

 Not correct. It is 1974 and older starting 1/1/03. 1975 and older starting 1/104 and so on.
The original SB42 was vetoed because of the 25 year drop-off. Kopp had to rewrite it to 30 years
with a 5 year moratorium on 1973 year model vehicles to get it passed.

Here is part of SB42:

 SB 42, Kopp.  Air pollution:  vehicles:  inspection and
maintenance.
   Existing law exempts any motor vehicle manufactured prior to the
1966 model-year from provisions requiring vehicles powered by
internal combustion engines in certain areas of the state to obtain a
smog check certificate of compliance or noncompliance biennially,
upon transfer of ownership, or upon registration of a vehicle
previously registered outside the state.
   This bill would, instead, exempt from those requirements any motor
vehicle manufactured prior to the 1974 model-year or, beginning
January 1, 2003, that is  30 or more model-years old.

Here is a pdf of the new rules for the Bay area. It also mentions the 30 year rolling cutoff on page
3.

This is straight from the Calif Air Resources Board.&quot;
