Subject: Re: [T2] the raw power of my 81 air cooled westy (Calif model)

Brad, perhaps it should do just a little bit better than that, but not much.  Load, headwind, just how &quot;flat&quot; flat is, etc all affect it of course.  I've had '81, '81, '82, '83 (which was an auto) with new engines I built in all, the autobox would only do about that, the '81 and '82 would do a bit better, maybe high 60's or very low 70's on what I guessed to be &quot;flat&quot; but for a slightly worn engine that doesn't seem that far off.  You engine is probably making 65-70hp or so max and it is probably a 2 1/2 ton vehicle if you have anything in it, maybe even more, not hard to figure it out.  Another tip running 55mph the engine will last 75-100k miles in a Vanagon Westy, running 65mph you may be lucky to see 40-50k miles, the autobox '83 I had was on its 3rd engine with a real original 72k miles on it (though the auto has some issues a stick doesn't for cooling.)  Not uncommon that #3 is the one lower on compression BTW, it always seems to be on a T4, just like it always was on
 a T1.  Tune it up, consider having a look at the injector spray patterns if you have the guts to get a gut feel fuel delivery is even all round, but I wouldn't expect a whole lot more.

The bus gets through to 4th gear fine. It will cruise at 55 with no problem
(without pedal to the metal), but top speed after about a mile or two is
63-65mph on flat land at about 300ft above sea level.

Should I expect any more power than I have? I'm thinking that I shouldn't but
wanted to be sure.
