Subject: Re: brian box needed( Spelling)

From: VWBrain_at_aol_dot_com
&gt;Hello Guys or is it buttholes    EXCUSE ME!!!!!!  make one little spelling 
&gt;error and all ya get is a bunch of BS back.

Hee hee.  Aw, Mark, don't let it get to you.  Whaddya expect from bus drivers?  It *was* pretty funny, especially since your email addy has &quot;brain&quot; in 
it.  And the Python connection was a good one.  I think of it as people having loads of fun over a typo, not a misspelling.  Mispelling.  Misspeling.
