&gt; I was wondering where this rule of thumb comes from,, what difference does it
&gt; make to the trans or axles if they are turning while being towed??
&gt; 
&gt; I was under the impression that the final drive in a BuS or BuG automatic trans
&gt; is the same as the manual and it could be towed safely as well...

 the automatic is different, VW says not to tow very fast forget the speed
or very far.

Bentley manual, Chapter 7 page 4
bottom of first column it says

&quot;Caution
 Never tow a car with automatic transmission faster than 30mph (48kph) or
farther than 30miles (48kmph)  bearings can be damaged by lack of
lubrication.  If you must tow the car farther, lift the rear wheels or
remove the driveshafts that connect the rear wheels to the transmission&quot;


&gt; Anyways,, I have towed both Auto and manual ACVW trans for hundreds of miles at
&gt; a time using a tow bar,, and never had a single trans/axle issue,, 

lucky.

I would not tow my automatic with the wheels on the ground, on a trailer
or a rollback
