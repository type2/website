Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny Problem

Got the problem fixed! 
It was just a matter of adjusting the linkage, greasing all the linkage.
Thanks to all who P-mailed their very good advise.

&gt; I've got an 81 Westy and it doesn't want to go into first gear.
&gt; It slips into second, third, fourth and reverse very easily and 
&gt; shifts
&gt; smoothly while driving, also downshifts OK.
