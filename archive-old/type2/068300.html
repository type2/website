Subject: BA^ Gas Heater

I am on  the verge  getting the BA6 Gas Heater to run properly, but fear
that I will need to replace the regulator that fits by the passenger's side
glove compartment. If any of you have an extra I will gladly take it off
your hands for a sum (for you).
Still, I have been able to get the whole unit running  and a few questions
remain:

1) how does the fan run at two speeds? does the regulator sense two voltages
and make the fan run at high speed when the ignition is off?

2) How hot should the core of the heater get? Dante's inferno? Red Hot?
Mild? Should sparks fly out?

I had the system at full blast and it really pumped out the heat -  almost
too hot to touch the output  vent.



3) How does the flame switch work?

The system is not yet installed - and i have been running it outside off of
the battery charger. It takes the battery boost (50 amps) to get the whole
thing running.

Thanks for any  advice and info on the regulator.

Thanks - DC
