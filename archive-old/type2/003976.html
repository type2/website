&gt;      This is a question out of curiousity.  How do the lengths of the
&gt;pop-tops differ for the front pivot and rear pivot pop-tops repectively.
&gt;That is, are they both the same lenth or is one longer than the other.

I just measured the actual canvas and the 68-73 canvas is 75 inches long on
the bottom and the 74-79 is 98 inches on the bottom, therefore making the
later much longer.
