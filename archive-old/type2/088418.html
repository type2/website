OK, took the dist back off.  Looked down the shaft and tried to move the
drive shaft  It would only wiggle just a bit.  Moves only when the
engine is cranked.  Made sure the dist was aligned right with the shaft
and put it back in.  I got it to where it is tight and does not slip at
all now as far as the rotor turning  Turns good with the engine  When on
the notch I am at TDC for #1.  Tried starting it but it still wont go.
I can get it to go for just a second though if I push the dist so far
forward that the vacuum can is up near the sensor in front of the dist
(FIF).  Now to remove drive shaft and put it back in per Bentley? Thanks
for the help.
 
 
Troy...whose bus never gives him a boring day.
