Subject: WTB: '78 EEC Valve and EGR Valve

Hi All,

I'm looking to buy an EEC valve. This is a vacuum controlled valve on the air filter assembly that =
controls whether fumes from the carbon cannister are sucked into the air filter or not. I had one =
go bad on me when I got my bus four years ago and replaced it with used oner. Now the replacement =
also leaks vacuum.=20

If anyone has a spare they'd like to sell or any info on repairing the one I have, please let me =
know. On a properly working one, you can suck on a hose connected to the vacuum port and this will =
open/close the valve. You should not be able to suck air through continuously. If this is the case =
then the valve has become a vacuum leak (like mine).

I'm also looking for an EGR valve.

Any leads appreciated.

Thanks,

Mark
