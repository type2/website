Subject: Gottabus! ...and Those Darn Archives

Greetings!

	I'm the proud new owner of a Type 2!  It's a 1970 seven-passenger,
and my first bus.  I've been lurking here for about a week or so in digest
mode.  (I've actually been a subscriber of this and other VW lists in the
past--including the *original* combined air &amp; water cooled list run from
arc.ames.nasa_dot_gov in the late eighties/early nineties!  I currently
administer the list over at vwtype3_dot_org.)  I've owned six vehicles in
eleven years of automobile ownership, all of them air-cooled VWs, and
currently have four of those six.  But never before a bus!!!

	I'm in Michigan, but I just took a trip to Arizona to visit
relatives and to go VW shopping.  I was looking for basic transportation,
with Squarebacks at the top of my list.  The ad for this '70 bus looked
interesting, though, so I had a look.

	It's just shy of 300,000 miles.  Wow--and it doesn't look an inch
over a quarter million. ;)  I bought it from the second, fourth and sixth
owner.  See, the PO bought it used in 1978, drove it a bunch, sold it to
his folks (who drove it a bunch), bought it back from them, later sold it
to a friend for a bit, then bought it again for the third time.  Wild.

	It's got a Z-products bed conversion installed on the stock rear
seat, as well as their front spare tire mount.  (I even found the
zproducts_dot_com site, where such kits are still listed!)  There are curtain
fixtures, but no curtains at the moment.  PO bought these kits years ago.
It's even got a trailer hitch!!  Engine is single port and basically stock,
but missing a healthy dose of tin. :(  Doghouse fan shroud, full flow oil
filter, semi-hemi heads (rebuilt 100mi ago) and dished-top pistons
(reportedly a cr of 6.5:1).  At least I shouldn't have to worry about
detonation problems...

	When doing the compression check, we unfortunately found out
first-hand why you don't pull spark plugs from a hot engine.  I'd rather
not talk about it, but let me just say that I'm now the (not-so-proud)
owner of a tap and some inserts.

	Turns out the PO had a trip from Phoenix to Wisconsin in the works
with his truck &amp; (empty) trailer to pick up a 1940s Buick engine and
drivetrain, so we worked in delivery to Michigan with the whole bus deal.
It's due to arrive a week from Friday; I'm counting the days!

	When it shows up, I'm going to town with the heads and other engine
tidbits.  Pop out the engine, tend to that pesky 1&amp;2 head with its crunchy
spark plug holes.  (I've installed an insert in a Type I with the engine in
the car, but this time I'm removing the head completely for a clean job.)
It's got a fair amount of missing tin, so I'll have all of that queued up
and ready to go on.  I just scored (Thanks, Mark J.!) doghouse pre-heat
flaps, and am just a few odds &amp; ends away from completing the entire
thermostat/flap system.  No flames, please; my wife &amp; daughter will be
driving this bus daily for an entire winter in Michigan, with temps
sometimes below zero F.!  (Actually, some flames might help keep us warm.;)
Hey, we're just a thermostat kind of family, o.k.?

	I've naturally got loads of questions, and the roll of film I shot
of the bus a week and a half ago now seems woefully inadequate.  I've been
combing through the archives, which is a mixed blessing:  I get tons of
questions answered, but I thereby keep eliminating reasons to join in the
chatter here on the list.  I've got my Bentley and just picked up a
second-hand '61-'72 Clymer for kicks.  It *does* have a correct upright
Type 2 exhaust parts blow-up, whereas the Bentley shows a dual pea-shooter
setup.  (However, you gotta wonder why the Clymer has instructions for
removing the '61-'67 bus window *crank*...)  On a whim, I downloaded the
entire Hoover sermons a couple of weeks ago w/ WebBuddy; those have been
great to revisit, too.  I'd pretty much ignored the bus-specific stuff in
the past.

	For both of you who are still reading this ;) you can see pictures
of our new bus on the Web!  I stuck them at
http://vwtype3_dot_org/bus/good.bus.pix/ .  If any of you bus-savvy folks sees
something worth drawing to my attention, please holler!

	I always knew I'd get a bus *some* day, but this one kind of snuck
up on me.  Glad to join this crowd!!!
