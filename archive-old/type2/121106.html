Subject: Hen's teeth (aka 74-79 bay window gas cap)

I know I'm not living right.  Just last week I bought an original gas
cap for my 79 camper for when it returns to me (if ever) from the body
shop.  Well, wouldn't you know it, I was gassing up my 74 Single Cab on
saturday and foolishly left the cap on the side gate and drove off into
the sunrise.  I returned to the station and no one turned my gas cap
in.  So I have taken my 79 camper gas cap and put it on the single cab
until i can find another gas cap for the 79 camper which leads my to my
current state of begging.  If anyone sees an original 74-79 non-locking
gas cap floating around in their posession, I am willing to pay a
reasonable amount of small unmarked bills (or paypal) to again procure
said gas cap for my 79 camper.  humbly yours, Greg
