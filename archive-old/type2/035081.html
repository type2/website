well the water hitting the cylinder heads should not be a problem, unless
you don't drive in the rain!

I've thought about this a few times, thinking a little simpler using the
garden sprayer type of mister and being able to electrically trigger it
from the dash, and just use it on Very hot days or climbing a long grade
or whatever.

but just haven't got around to it yet,  all the other things that this VW
is giving me to work on has delayed this optional project
