&gt;I am in the process of installing a replacement mechanical fuel pump.  In

&gt;a suitable replacement for universal grease ?  Will this work in my fuel
&gt;pump?

Remember that some of the grease in that area is going to partly dissolve from contact with the oil that runs from the cam to the hole in the case before the pump:

So, either use a thick grease sparingly or a thinner one.
