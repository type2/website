Subject: Re: [T2] News Article...

Steve,

Anything to catch killers....BTW, Kristen's parents(and lawyers)
have been in Arkansas suing the state for $3,000,000 because they claim
that the state of Arkansas failed to adequately police/protect people at
that rest stop.

Not sure how I feel about that as I haven't seen the rest stop as it
has been closed since somtime shortly after the murder.

Should be on the news someplace...

I thought that they had captured someone in California that had
admitted to the murder...

Cheers, dave

&gt; Volks,

&gt; As many of you will remember, Kristen Ann Laurite was travelling alone across
&gt; the United States in her 1971 bus and was murdered at a rest area on I-40 in
&gt; Arkansas in August of 2000.  That murder is still unsolved but I saw an
&gt; article on the CNN web site today that sparked my interest...
&gt; 
&gt; See this article:
&gt; http://www.cnn_dot_com/2004/US/02/27/possible.serial.killer/index.html
&gt; 
&gt; As I read it, I was reminded of the murder of Kristen Laurite, which remains
&gt; unsolved.  Altho there are definite differences, there are also similarities.
&gt; I have the name and number of the prinicapal investigator at the time and
&gt; intend to call him in an hour or two but don't want to be the 40th to do so
&gt; (actually I am not sure if that might  not be a good thing, but...)
&gt; 
&gt; Any comment?
&gt;
