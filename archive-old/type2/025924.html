Man...someone left some vowels out of that diagram.  The &quot;I&quot; and the &quot;O&quot; are
missing.  Now how in the heck do they expect someone to do this with an
incomplete alphabet?

If I were following these instructions I would only get it fixed so far,
then I would have to call my mechanic to find out how to proceed from there.

I swear, some people just never learnt ABC's letters every good did they?

God forbid I ever have to fix this on my bus.
