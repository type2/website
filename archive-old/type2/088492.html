Subject: Rear disc brakes

Good morning all.

I was just wondering if anyone ever tried putting disc brakes on the rear of
a Bus.  I frequent the junkyard here in Atlanta, and there are always any
number of Mercedes with rear discs, and the thought just occurred to me one
day.

I don't think I have ever driven a vehicle with properly maintained brakes
that were inadequate for the vehicle.  A Bus would not be an exception, but
the cool factor I think would be pretty high.  And for anyone with a beefed
up T4 or maybe a TransVair, more braking wouldn't be bad.  Not to mention
these are one ton trucks.

Ah, so three reasons for.  Very cool, extra speed, heavy loads.  Thoughts,
anyone?

I hope everyone has a great day.
