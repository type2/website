&gt;  Disconnect the double relay, and fuel pump wires. run a &quot;temp&quot; wire from
&gt; the battery to the fuel pump, and hook a ground up to the other side,
&gt; respecting the polarity + and -, check fuel pressure at the rail, should be
&gt; 30-40psi.

Just so you know, it's much easier to just pull off the air filter and 
push a screwdriver and open the flapper.  Or, if you've already pulled 
off the cover from the AFM, just actuate the fuel switch in there.
