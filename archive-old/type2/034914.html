Subject: Ruminations on heating a VW bus while camping

My brain keeps straying over into this topic. Since all my neighbors have 
Caddies or SUVs (or both) and stay in fancy hotels, it's no use talking 
to them, so I'll think out loud here.

The problem: staying warm in a VW bus under a variety of conditions.

The parameters: The cost limit is determined by the price of a 
Propex/Carver heater. Ideally, it should be possible to stay warm for 
less than half the price of one of these (~$600). Costs discussed here 
are capital costs, not operating costs.

Conditions:

1. Driving. While the bus is underway, I am convinced (on small evidence) 
that G. Matthew Bulley has this subject sussed. Get the stock heat 
working correctly, insulate the system and the bus. Be warm.

2. Camping. This is where the Carver would be handy, but expensive. And 
the difficulty with it is that there are variety of heating requirements 
when camping, while the Carver is just one solution. So it's necessary to 
break these down a bit.

2a. Sleeping while camping. I believe that it is expensive and wasteful 
to heat the entire bus interior while sleeping. But then, I don't live in 
Maine anymore and I camp without children or significant other. Even so: 
The money spent on a heater is really better spent on warm bedding. A 
down sleeping bag can be had for $200 or less; one can buy three wool 
Pendelton Yakima blankets for $180; polar fleece blankets are cheap. If 
the bus is already insulated (see #1, above), the further insulation of 
appropriate bedding lets you be the furnace. Eat hearty! But note one 
additional modification: get a piece of 1/2&quot;-3/4&quot; closed-cell foam 
(usually sold as a cheap substitute for a Thermarest) and cut a 6' X 10&quot; 
piece from it. Put this up around the perimeter of the Z-bed or other at 
night, like the &quot;bumper pad&quot; of a child's crib. This further insulates, 
and prevents infiltration of cold air around the rear hatch. 

2b. That shocking first five minutes when you have to get out of the 
cocoon in the morning, dress, and warm your clothing. The cheapest way to 
do it is to be manly about it! Or womanly! But there is an alternative. 
I frankly think that the very cheap propane radiant heaters are ideal for 
this. Set one next to the bed so that you can aim it at your body and 
place one of those special lighters for campstoves next to it. When it is 
time to get up, reach out and light the thing. These give off almost 
instant heat. In less than a minute you can emerge from the bed and 
dress. As soon as you do, SHUT IT OFF. These are not space heaters, and 
they'll kill you dead if you use them that way inside a bus. But I think 
that they are perfectly safe to use for a period of five minutes or so, 
as a space heater.

2c. Meanwhile fire up one or more Coleman plat-cat heaters. These have 
been amply discussed, and some among our growing committee of list 
administrators think that talking about heat on a VW bus list is a 
category mistake.

2d. Dress appropriately. Thermofax underwear goes a long way.

3. Real space heat. There are endless discussions of space heat in the 
archives. Nevertheless, there is an option that hasn't been adequately 
aired, methinks. This is using a retrofitted oozer heater core and fan 
to provide space heat in a stationary bus. The unresolved question is how 
to heat the water that will pass through and heat the core. I think there 
are two workable solutions to this.

3a. Solution one: get some kind of water heater/boiler/heater exchanger 
and carry it in the bus. Then, as part of making camp, set it up outside 
the bus, hook up the water lines to the heater core, and fire it up using 
the appropriate fuel. Inconvenient but well-vented.

3b. The elegant but untested solution two: Cut a big rectangular hole in
the side of the bus and install a box that is sealed from the interior of
the bus. Cover the hole with an RV-style vented cover. Inside the box, 
install a tankless propane water heater. Plumb the water heater to a pump 
and then to the heater core in the bus. Rig up a thermostat. Insulate as 
needed. Worry about corrosion, etc.

4. Extra insulation for camping. This has also been discussed at length 
and is in the archives. Get some insulation on the windows and in the 
poptop. I like the idea of sewing up a poptop liner of two layers of 
&quot;NASA insulation&quot; including the roof area and hanging it inside the poptop 
canvas.

5. Redundancy and overlap. If redundant systems were good enough for 
NASA, they are good enough for me. I think that a combination of 
insulation, clothing, bedding, a radiant propane heater for short bursts 
of heat, and a plat-cat for longer bursts, is the way to go. I'd like to 
replace the plat-cat with the water-core heater discussed above, though. 
(But I would probably still carry the plat-cat.)

With warm regards,
