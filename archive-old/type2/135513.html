Subject: Re: [T2] towin a bus with a Pontiac 6000

A tow dolly will do the work. I have towed with my dolly our Westy and a previous Westy 200+ miles. 

However... Stopping is big problem depending on your tow vehicle. A flat trailer might have electric brakes which is a wonderful feature IMHO. 

FWD cars are a bit light in the rear. Should you stop hard it MIGHT push you sideways. The engine if in good condition ought to do it fine but the tranny will pay the price for hard driving. If it was across town, and slow, no problem. I've pulled a Westy with 2.4L Nissan p/u with a wornout auto tranny. No problems up to 45 mph. I have moved one with my CR-V (around neighborhood). A problem. Stopping and starting. Not enough torque. Toyota p/u with V-6, no problem but I worried ALOT about any panic stops. Was a the longest tow. 

400 miles? Would either be a LONG drive at 50 mph or less or I'd rent/borrow/buy a big truck. No interstates.

Towed my westy across town (mostly 55-65 mph) on our dolly last Friday. Did fine, no surprises. We moved. Now I've got a garage and that all important 2nd bathroom. &lt;grin!&gt; Did it with a 2001 GMC 4WD 3/4 ton long bed pickup. Borrowed. No THAT'S a tow vehicle. No strain. Proper instruments to tell if the engine temp is high, tranny temp is high, oil pressure, etc. A rental is prob cheaper than a new Pontiac tranny (the weakest point IMHO).
