Subject: Re: [T2] vanagon seats in my 77 Bay

Ok, all this talk about Vanagon seats in Bays, I can't vouch for all year
Bays, but I have a Vanagon drivers side seat in my '75 Westy, and while it
DOES fit in the track, there is no way to secure the seat in the track
other than bending up the tabs in front of the Vanagon seat track. This
also makes the seat un- adjustable in terms of sliding it forward/back. At
6'4&quot;, I simply put it all the way back and bent all the tabs in front of
the track upward. It also makes my head touch the ceiling if I don't
slouch, but it sure is comfortable! I also have Vanagon seats in my '84
Vanagon Westy, and, of course, those fit fine!   Jeff
