You may have a thrown rod, or a seized main bearing, or rusted pistons,
but start with the pistons first.
Get a can of &quot;Marvel Mystery Oil&quot;, from parts house. Pour approx. 1/4
cup into each spark plug hole, then replace plugs loosely. hake the car
to spread the MMO around the cyls. Leave for 3-4 days. Attempt to turn
motor over. If you can't turn the motor over by hand,wrench on pulley or
by rocking the bus in 1st gear, you need further testing, aka: pull the
engine.
