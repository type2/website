Subject: Restoring Fiberglass top

Joel, I have been building and restoring fiberglass canoes for years and
have found that the only tried and true way to restore undamaged
fiberglass is to buff/rub it with compound until it is smooth and shiny,
and then seal it with a UV resistant wax or acrylic-teflon.  I have not
yet found a &quot;One-Step&quot; product for fiberglass that delivers what it
promises. Most either don't work at all or leave the finish looking
streaked and oily. 3m makes some great buffing compounds and waxes. You
can buy the liquid compounds by the gallon at most automotive paint
supply houses. Good compound and elbow grease will remove the oxidation
and bring back the color and shine. Then just seal it and keep it
sealed. Re-wax as often as conditions (sun/heat/acid rain/pelican poot)
call for it.

If you have damage to the top, get with me and I'll tell you how to
repair it.
