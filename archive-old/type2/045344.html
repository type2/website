Remove the rocker assemblies.  Keep your pinky and thumb over the ends of the rocker shaft to keep the parts from sliding off.  Place the complete assembly inside an inverted valve cover which ought to be nearby.  Cover with a clean rag till you're ready to reassemble.  As for the tin, that upper piece is a bear to remove with the engine installed.  It can be done, but you'll have to almost completely strip the motor!
