Subject: Re: [T2] paper or metal intake manifold gasket?

&gt; Tomorrow I am going to pull that intake and put in a different gasket.  I am
&gt; currently using metal, so i think i will try the paper one.......Any thoughts?

Last time I changed mine I was recommended to use the paper ones.  I don't
have any scientific evidence as to whether they are better or not, but I've
had no problems.
