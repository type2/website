Subject: Re: [T2] full flow filter problems; again

&gt;I have completed the assembly of a new Berg engine  and, prior to 
&gt;actual  startup, I am cranking it on a test stand trying to get oil to 
&gt;circulate through the full flow filter attachment. This is my first 
&gt;experience with  such an  add-on.
&gt;
&gt;After extensive &quot;priming&quot;, I can get oil to spurt out of the oil pump 
&gt;cover and down the flexible line to the input port on the filter 
&gt;housing.  I filled the filter full of oil, but can not get a drop of oil 
&gt;to flow at the output of the housing. It is as though the pump is too weak 
&gt;to push the oil through the filter.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone had this difficulty? Any recommendations for a solution?

Just dealt with this the day before yesterday, as a matter of fact.  8o)

Pull the spark plugs, and the black wire off the + terminal of the coil 
(tape up).
Loosen the connection of the hose coming from the oil pump cover to the
filter AT THE FILTER END, so that air can escape.  Using a remote starter
(or helpful assistant at the ignition switch), crank until oil starts to 
come out
of the connection, then tighten it up.  Resume cranking until the oil light 
goes
out.  Install spark plugs and reconnect power to coil.  Unless your battery
is really new and strong, I'd recommend running a battery charger while
you're cranking.
