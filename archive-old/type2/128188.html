Subject: Re: [T2]Spark Plug PiCs after 360 miles (Advice)

Yup, they do look a little(lot) rich, and you are
right it could be the mixture, jets, and choke, one
you can mark off is the choke, take the breathers off
and watch them to make sure they open when warmed up.
after that make sure the mixture control screw is set
right, I believe it's in till it drops then back out a
1/2 turn? (both sides) After that, it's down to
changing the main jet sizes till the plugs clear up.
you were right, better rich than lean. If you change
the jets be sure to put the same size on both carbs.
Good luck with it, maybe someone else has a better
idea. Phil
