 Mike,

  If you have not already purchased the mini-truck campers you have been looking at and have the time/talent/inclination, you may want to look at the plans for the VW Bug-Camper conversion at Robert Q. Riley's site (www.rqriley_dot_com).  I'm sure that these plans could be adapted to a single/double cab (plus you could make it exactly the way YOU want).
