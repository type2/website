&quot;Does anyone know of a place where I can pick up a new tank and have it
overnight delivered? I realllllllly need to get her back on the road this
week while the 411 is in the shop (besides, this is just the incentive I
need to finally finish up the engine work).

how about the Busdepot? They are just north of Philly.
