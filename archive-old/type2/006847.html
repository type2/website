Hey, that sounds pretty cool, and I would definately be interested.  I live
in South Dakota, and it is pretty scarce bus country, but there have been
some bus sightings within the city (mostly by my friends).  How do you go
about hooking up with other bus owners in the city?  Especially those who
aren't on a list like this  :-)

Oh... Bus content...  that clunking in my front right corner of my bus, which
was occurring when the suspension was actuated, has stopped with a couple
warm weather days.  Any clue as to the cause?  I checked the ball joints, the
rubber is cracked, and I have no clue as to when the shocks were installed.
 Could it be them?

thanks...
dave
