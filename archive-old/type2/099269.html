Subject: Re:the dangerous things we do (was seat belt ass'y
  dissassembly)

You mean you have &quot;sloppy fairies&quot; watching out over you also? (:   They
let you get into scrapes but don't let you get killed......Countless
times have I had &quot;near misses&quot; to the hereafter (like that time I
thought I was on a main road and rolled right through a stop, realizing
it only when a car zipped behind me, missing me by inches.  When I was
12 I made a cloud chamber to see radium tracks, using a fishbowl and a
refrigerant pump to create a vacuum in it as it rested on a platform I
made....it imploded in my face and luckily I'd been wearing glasses
since I was 6 and had cuts just to my nose and forehead.  More recently,
I parked our Westy on the hill above our house where the garage is, and
went into the house to get something as my daughter 13 then) waited in
the bus.  The parking brake failed, and I came out to see it start down
the hill backwards to our house, with Nyssa clutching her seat looking
backwards- for a brief minute I wanted to jump in and hit the brake, but
good thing I did not, or I'd have been run over- it hit a load of gravel
we had piled in front of a pool behind the house and stopped- or it
would have been in the pool!

 It hit me in the face about one inch below my left eye.  Please don't
mess around with those things.  I don't really remember how I got it
rolled back together now, and
 I don't think I want to remember... 
         I've done about half a dozen really stewpid things in my life
that
&gt; probably should have left me maimed or dead (or worse), and that one little
&gt; stunt still ranks about number 3 or 4.  Please - I don't want to have to
&gt; read about anyone on the list have to go spend a charming afternoon at the
&gt; local emergency room.  Those things just work, and that's all you need to
&gt; know!
