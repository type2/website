I just acquired a 21 windoe splitty

It is totally dismantled
and I want to put the largest and best engine
in it available.

Any suggestions??

I'd get a 1600 single port.    I think that is the best for practicality and
has enough pep to get you around and up the hills.      Dual ports teend to
crack n the heads.     

Get a copy of John Muir Idiot Book and a copy of the Bentley reprint of the VW
Transporter Workshop Manual for 63-67 buses.  (this is the dark blue one)   if
you dont already have them.
