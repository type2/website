Message-ID: &lt;37440049disabling a brake booster.....*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

&gt;1970 but has a 1974 nose. It has front disc brakes and a brake booster. The 
brake booster now is connected to my single port
&gt;intake mainfold. I'm considering putting a dual port engine in and am 
wondering how to configure the brake booster in this
&gt;situation.  If there is no way to hook up the booster hose can I just block 
it off?

You could find a 1971 intake manifold and use that to have both the dual port 
and the brake power assist, as it has the vacuum
port you need.
