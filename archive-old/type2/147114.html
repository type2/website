Subject: [T2] Replacement of fuel lines

 

So can anyone tell me the gospel on which fuel lines I'm to replace, as I've

just picked up this 77 westy and I do NOT need it to go up in flames, I

would be heartbroken. Diagrams are good, I'm a visual learner. Instructions

can only go so far with me. :-)

 

 

 

Thanks!!

 

Courtney
