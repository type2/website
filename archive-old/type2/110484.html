Subject: Re: [T2] ATTN:Richard Atwell / vacuum hose guide

Hello Jason,

I had to &quot;make&quot; the molded vacuum hoses using
appropriate lengths of heater hose and plumbing elbows
from LOWE$. When I get my didigal camera out, I will
take pictures of them. I just used hose clamps and
large wire ties to make the connections stable. At
first, I tried to use long lengths of heater hose to
replace these molded vacuum lines but I had to make
them very large to keep the sharp curves from
colasping. I did not like this so I used the elbows to
compensate for the sharp curves. This makes them
sturdier, neater, and less likely to collapse from
vacuum. When I take the pictures of these hoses, I
will let you know what sizes of heater hose I used and
what type and size of elbows I used. So far, this
seems to work and they hold vacuum fine. Have a great
day!

Regards,

David Kelly

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yes, all but two. The NLA molded hose from the
&gt; s-boot to the decel valve
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; the NLA molded hose from the s-boot to the oil
&gt; breather. The latter failed
&gt; &gt; on me and a list angel was kind enough to supply a
&gt; replacement.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks Richard for the info. A thought on the two
&gt; molded hoses. If I could
&gt; find the right size hose to match them or something
&gt; close, would it be
&gt; necessary for them to be molded? The bends don't
&gt; seem to be severe enough to
&gt; restrict flow on a non molded hose.
