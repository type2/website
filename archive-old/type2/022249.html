Subject: Re: Fuel pump, again?  Why me.

I have had that happen to me before.  When you take the pump off the motor, 
try rotating the shaft and see if it falls down into the block just a 
little more.  What was happening to mine was the shaft had gotten wedged up 
a little higher and over extended into he pump.  It wore out the pump in 
short time, twice.

HTH!

&gt;It has just gotten warm enough around here for me to start driving my '72

&gt;had problems with not enough fuel to the engine (1700 pancake, twin weber), i
&gt;replaced my mechanical fuel pump and all seemed well (it seemed to be leaking
&gt;a tiny bit of oil but i was going to fix that later).  On my way home from
&gt;school today cruising at a nice 50mph in 4th gear, that same damn thing
&gt;happened, again, lost power, started to buck.  I pulled over, on level, open
&gt;up the engine area, sure enough barely any gas could be seen in my fuel
&gt;filter, running on good ol' gravity feed again.  The fuel flow seems fine when
&gt;i took the gas lines out and had it splash all over my face, new fuel pump,
&gt;what is the problem?  Or do I have to replace my fuel pump every 100 miles or
&gt;something.
&gt;
&gt;Any help would really be appreciated, the only mechanic that I trust not to
&gt;rip me off is 250 miles away in NJ!
