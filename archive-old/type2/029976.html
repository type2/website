Fuses are rated in amperes, not watts.  white fuses are 8A and red fuses
are 16A.  The color code is pretty strictly followed, so you ask for them
by color.  I don't know if Radio Shack has them, but most FLAPS do.

&gt; How many watts are the white fuses?
&gt; What about the red ones?

&gt; I don't have a manual or anything to tell me what they are, I was
&gt; going to go to radio shack and replace the white one i blew.
