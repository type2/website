Ernie,
Check condition of Aux battery, fluid, connections, isolator,etc....
Put in larger deep-cycle battery for Aux. RV center or Boat shop will
have information on this system, maybe even diagrams.
you can put in a third battery, RV Center Boat shop will have this 
information also.  Be sure to use fuseable links or fuses in your wiring
of the correct amperage.
