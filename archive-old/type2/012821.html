&gt;depends, does the roof have a luggage rack notched into the fiberglass
&gt;top or is it straight?

&gt;bus at a reverse angle, don't know what that style is called. Look for a

It's called a late Adventure, they started that one in about '75.  There were
at LEAST 3 Adventure roof options on bays, short length with big rear rack,
full roof, full roof with the overhanging nose.  The first is mostly early

wanted it even on a late one.  So all those styles can be Adventure, like
