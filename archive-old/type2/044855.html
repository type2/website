Subject: RE: [T2] TORSION ARMS  HELLLPP!!!!!

&gt;The arms slide on and goes about 1.5&quot; away from where they need to be 
&gt;and then stop.  According to the directions you just need to hammer them 
&gt;on and they should go pretty easy. We hammered for 2hrs and they wont go.

What I found when I did mine is that when I put the arm back on one side and 
pounded it all the way that it sort of &quot;pre-tensioned&quot; the torsion leaves on 
the opposite end.  I had to knock the first one back off of it's stop before I 
could get the other arm started on its torsion leaves.  

I was told after writing up the procedure that this shouldn't matter, but it 
certainly seemed to.  The weld on the torsion leaves on the second side (the 
one that didn't yet have the arm on it) popped when I put the arm on the first 
side.  I didn't have access to a welder so I put mine back together without the 
weld.  I suppose if the leaves were properly welded together that it wouldn't 
matter if you &quot;started&quot; both arms first or not.

So if I were you I'd try backing off the arm that you've already got on (not 
all the way, just off of the metal stop) and then try to put the other one on.
