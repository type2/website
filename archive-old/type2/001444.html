Hey Volks,
I would like to thank everyone who shared their insight concerning my sway
bar/oil cooler/poptop questions. Now that I have been steered(so to speak)
in the right direction about tires and load ratings, leaky oil coolers, and
great ideas for screen repair, I feel like I have a panel of experts ready
to look over my shoulder. It makes for a big confidence booster!

I am almost done removing the camper stuff so i can get a better idea of my
rust repairs. I think that I won't reinstall my refridgerator(a cooler will
work fine for me) and since the stove is not present(or the sink) I may pull
the propane tank and lines as well.  If someone needs em make an offer as I
have no idea what they are worth.

I think I will sew my screen to some velcro and try to make it work that
way. I will provide updates as things progress.

I noticed that there is another Andy from Miami on this list, so Andy any
recomendations that you may have in the way of VW resources here in south
Florida would be greatly appreciated.

I hope to take &quot;The Avocado&quot; on a cross country journey later this spring so
I will be looking for lots of help in order to get her ready....

Thanks Again,
Andy(miami,jr) 76 Westy
