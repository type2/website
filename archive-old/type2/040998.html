Subject: New fixens on crapen 1660

Before I start here I would like to say that the June Bug Jamboree was a
success for this family.  The 71 1600 Westy took 1st place in class#20
Stock.
I was very surprised and estatic.  The place was jamed with every type of VW
imaginable.  The site was perfect and everyone seemed to have a lot of fun.
Thanks guys for announcing it here.

Now, I has a pregunto (question).  The old bean mobile has had everything
replaced recently, anothere tanie, valves adjusted, new wiring everywhere,
new distributor(the Ignitor did not fit the cam on the new Bosch 009 soooo I
sent it back) new tuneup etc.  There is nothing else to replace on the
engine itself.  Before the  distributor was put in I would turn the key and
the car would start immediately.  Now its takes several cranks and sometimes
several trys as if its starving for gas.  Once it warms up she takes off.

Also if the car is in first when I try to start her, it feels as if the
clutch is trying to engage(its a manhuel trani) four speed.

Something is wrong.

Any ideas guys.

P.S. I parked at the KOA and Springfield and did not find any of the Type 2
gang.  Sorry if I missed ya.
