Well, it didn't happen today. Two things changed. I'm
not one to change two things at a time for evaluation
purposes, but the second was unavoidable.
 
One - I filled up the tank last night. I do have a
sluggish / tempermental fuel sender, it is possible
that I was running out of gas both times. 

Two - Went out to the bus after work and put the key in
and got nothing - no click, no tick, no lights, no
nuthin.' Went to the back of the bus and opened up
the decklid and saw that the + cable had come off the
battery. I reconnected it after completely disconnecting
the battery and then hooked everything back up. The way 
I figure, it was been barely attached (dangerous!). It
is now secure, though.
 
Evaluating the stretch of road that it was happening
on I found that there was a bump right before where it
happened, and a slight downhill. The bump could have
jarred the battery and the cable might have loosened.
Shifting into third &quot;pushed&quot; it back in. OR, I might
have been running out of gas.. being on a down grade may have put all the fuel towards the front away from
the hose and then coincedentally as I shifted in to
third, I was on an uphill slope. 

Of course, it could just me the Busmuda Triangle. 

Of course, I'm probably wrong on all three accounts.
