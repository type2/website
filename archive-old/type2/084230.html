Subject: Further, tomorrow...

Listees;
   Thanks for the input from all of you who responded to the plea for
help with Nikki's bus, which is still back by my shop tonight. Been
finding bits that need attention, but just ran out of steam before they
all got done. Will pick up in the morning and try to resolve the issues
with this poorly running engine. Special thanks to David Schwartz, Steve
Dolan, Bob from California, Phil Houtz, Chris Mills, Dave C. Bolen for
their direct input. I'll be applying the collective knowledge in the
morning.

Goodnight and bless you all;
