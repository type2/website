Hi Folks, happy new year,
  Earlier Steve said
    &quot;...The first is plain old anti-sieze compound.  It is metal based      
and should be corrosion-inhibitive and conducting...&quot;

   I just put the leads of my multimeter into a blob of copper based 
antisieze and did not get a continuity reading.  I guess it's not conductive 
after all.
