I've got one of these and had it for about 3 years now.  It works great!  
I forget how much I paid for it but it was from Rainbow Electronics in 
Indianapolis, Indiana.  This gizmos has been affectionately known as, 
&quot;The Brake Light Tester.&quot;

I have had great experiences with this gizmo. Mine is a little black 
plastic box with a red button it.  It also has a red LED to let you know 
the state of the 9v contained within.

We have a row of bushes on the north side of the house.  It's a dense 
thicket comprised of evergreens brought in the from the farm when I 
was 4 years old.  It killed all the fruit trees in the surrounding 
neighborhood but life's tough I guess.  Anyhow, I have an old chair that 
belonged to my grandmother which she intended for the trash but that I 
salvaged.  The chair is placed so that I can sit undetected about 15 to 
20 feet from passing cars and pedetrians.  The street I happen to live on 
is a major link between to busy streets and since there is an elementary 
school bordering this road, I live a block from the only 4 way stop along 
the route.  At night, teens run the stop signs and various others can't 
find it to slow down from 35 to 25 for about 5 blocks.  This is the 
perfect setup.  Heck, even the cops sit on the street and catch 
speeders.  See what I'm getting at?   You guessed it, PRIME brake light 
testing territory.

I have caused cars to suddenly sqeal the brakes as they drop from 45+ to 
under 25 within seconds.  I've heard about all the different sounds a 
detector can make and the cursing from the occupants from within on a warm 
summer night when all the windows are open.  I consider myself a secret 
enforcer of the law on occasion when I go sit in the chair in the 
bushes...a soda in one hand, little black box in the other. :-)

On the highway, it's an excellent tool to use for passing people.  You 
know that jerk you always end up behind that drives 50 then 60 then 55, 
etc. - can't hold a constant speed?  One blip from the box usually makes 
them slow way down and you can pass easily.  I have also nailed a guy 
repeatedly for 40 miles all the way from Lincoln to Beatrice.  He would 
pass me, then I'd nail him.  He'd slow down, and I'd pass him, etc.  We 
leaped frog the whole way home and poor soul was so confused after 
getting back home, I leaned out and pointed it at him.  When he caught 
on, he shut off his radar detector, got pissed and drove off in a huff.  
I had fun that night.

So yes, these things do exist and they do work.  Mine starts making 
detectors beep at about 3 blocks (1/4 mile) and usually pegs the meters 
from point blank range up to a block - but not further than that.

It's worth the money...I've had more fun than you can shake a garage door 
opener at.

Slater!
