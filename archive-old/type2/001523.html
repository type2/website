Hi all,

     Well, I am finally getting around to dropping my fuel tank.  I do have
a question for you all.  Are the small lines the same ID as the vacuum lines
in the engine compartment?  This is what I was told &amp; they look a little
small to fit on those barbed fittings on the plastic cross piece.  Thanks.
