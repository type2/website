Subject: [T2] Burnt Volkswages in general:

Just a reminder, I have seen more than one Volkswagen burnt to the ground
from an engine fire. One thing I have noticed is most of the time the fuel
inlet tube is missing from the carburetor. This tube is a press in fit. I
make it a habit of taping this tube in any time I have the fuel line off.
Another thing is fuel filters between the pump and carburetor. This is the
pressure side of the system, the filter should be on the suction side.
Anytime you have a failure on the pressure side, fuel is spraying until the
engine dies from lack of fuel in the carburetor. By then you have a very big
fire going.

Tim I just saw your post about electric fuel pumps. A good way to add a
little safety to electric fuel pumps is to wire them through a relay. Using
a common 20 amp Volkswagen relay, with the relay getting its ground signal
from the negative side of the Ign. This way when the engine is not turning
over the fuel pump wont run. In an accident the fuel pump wont pump gas all
over the place. I will be glad to send anyone wanting the wiring procedure,
contact me off list and I'll send you a diagram.
