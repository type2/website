Subject: [T2] got Her running!

ok ok for all those that have helped me out on this...
from the starter to the flywheel to such...
i have read all and took into consideration and have her running finally...


i set the TDC and got the timing close with the distrib and she crank...
took a bit and she is a little groggy but she crank...
i have a new set of plugs today that i will put on and  i will recheck timing again since the #3 plug insulator has a broken place on its side..

this might be what is affecting the skipping and power loss in her?

i will know more this eve when returning home.

the valves will also have to be set after the timing is correct,...
peace and to all thanks...
