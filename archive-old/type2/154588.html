Subject: Re: [T2] Splittie profiteering

&gt; BTW, most amateur collectors end up with the cars they would 
&gt; have bought (if they had the money then) or actually had when 
&gt; they were 18-24 years old...Serious collectors (like Jay Leno) 
&gt; just buy eveything else...;-) 

At 29 I ended up with the car I SHOULD have had when I was 18-24, make that 16-29.
