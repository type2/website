Subject: RE: [T2] Pilot Bearing question...

I just went through this with my 74 bus. There was no bearing left, well the
outer part was there, couldn't really tell, what I did was get an old
flathead and used it as a chisel to go at it with it took some time and help
from a friend holding the flywheel from moving. It kind of came out in
strips of metal. a few hours of beating on the hammer it was all out , the
new one went in like butter:)
if yours is that far gone you should look at the end of the shaft of the
tranny, to see if its been beating around and worn ,if so you might wanna
use a different tranny or get that one fixed.
Hope you have fun

Subject: [T2] Pilot Bearing question...



Ok I've pulled my engine.
I removed the flywheel and unless I am mistaken the pilot bearing should be
in the little hole behind the flywheel.
I think there is a well worn outside ring of one but how to get it out?
