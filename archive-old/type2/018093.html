&gt; I would go over the motor visually, check and feel each hose and make sure
&gt; the connections are airtight, check the integrity of your hose clamps - use
&gt; only your best. then make sure the main brain plug is seated in it's holster,
&gt; another one to miss is the 9 pronger on the air flow meter, is it seated
&lt;snip&gt;
Ultimately you might just replace the air flow meter with an understudy,
&gt; jiggle some wires and the thing will roar to life and drive happily for 40k.
&gt; I hope so anyway.

Chris and Joe:
Good advice (and apparently the resistor block was the problem), but I
seem to remember that a 78 would run WITHOUT the AFM EVEN HOOKED UP!
(apparently it goes to some default settings or something). Am I
remembering this right? What would keep the double relay (fuel pump)
running after the starter stopped? I distinctly remember driving down
the road once and pulling off cause it was running poorly and not
responding, finding the connector to the AFM off- remembering that I'd
had it out just before I'd started- hooked it back up, and it was just
fine again! This was in the mid 80's, so maybe it's one of those dreaded
flashbacks they always warned about!
