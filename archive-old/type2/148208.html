Subject: Re: [T2] Wife sez the bus isn't reliable enough to go to
  California!

Our philosophy is to have at least two so that if the primary camper
is down when it is vacation time, we have a backup so we can make the
trip.

The trouble is when you buy into the rescue of distressed buses
concept and we have 6 buses at present, and two in the que that we
told people we just can't take anymore until the current crop is
completed.

Then we find working on the rescue buses takes time away from our
buses, and our readiness is not good.

 This may annoy some on the list but ...

 Some here *love* busses so much that they have to own more than one.
 Which often also means they own more than one that needs work.

 When I see how hard it gets to find time to maintain my only bus given
 my relatively untroubled life (wife is easy on me, no kids, family
 sits across oceans :-). I wonder how you guys do it - or maye not do
 it.
