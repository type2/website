&gt; Actually, your not very far off another thing that I'm planning on doing. I

&gt; I've come to realize that most people are now almost totally dependant on
&gt; seeing that third light to recognize that you're braking. I figure that if I
&gt; make it flash, its more likely to get their attention.

Years ago they sold a third brake like called a &quot;Cyberlight&quot; that did just
that.  The quicker you slowed down, the faster it flashed!
