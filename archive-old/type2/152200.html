&gt; I agree with Terry's assessment.... used to own an autobody shop in Chicago, so
&gt; have seen a few of these cases before.  If this were a late model, you would
&gt; probably get a new front panel plus some time on the rack to straighten the
&gt; pillar.  But it is not new, so the insurance company will offer you as little
&gt;
&gt;    book value - salvage value (of parts, scrap metal, etc)
&gt;
&gt; In other words, they give you book value*, you give them salvage value and
&gt; retain title.  Before you agree to do this, you should assure yourself you can
&gt; find someone to fix the Bus for an acceptable number of dollars.  I gather
&gt; there are a couple of very good Type 2 repair guys in your neck of the woods,
&gt; Randleman, N.C. was mentioned on this List not long ago.

VERY IMPORTANT, make sure they DON'T use the &quot;blue book&quot; value, vehicles
that old are list in the &quot;green Book&quot; usually can be found at the main
library.  the green Book is for &quot;Classic&quot; vehicles, when my 78 was hit the
blue book value was $750, and they wanted to total it, the green book
value was $2,800  they fixed it...
