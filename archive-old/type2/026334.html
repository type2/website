&gt; Well in the UK a rev limiter costs about £10 ($16 USA) I see them in the
&gt; my
&gt; (somewhat out of date) RMMW catalogue for $29.95(USA). I'm sure they won't
&gt; have gone up to $100 dollars by now. Take a look at the distributor page
&gt; and
&gt; the rev limiter is built into the rotor arms.
&gt; 
&gt; A damm good idea from VW for prolonging the life of your engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck
&gt; Bob
&gt; 
&gt; PS
&gt; For those with catalytic converters these rev limiters should NOT be used
&gt; -
&gt; they work by earthing the HT, which results in unburnt fuel being expelled
&gt; from the cylinder into the catylitic converter. This distroys the precious
&gt; metals in the converter.
	[...] 
	[Crick, Bill [KAN:0W40-M:EXCH]]  I was also told by a shop in
British Columbia that they are not
	a good idea in the mountains. You go down a long &quot;hill&quot; rev with the
rev limiter kicked in.
	Two things happen. First the unburned gas washes the oil off your
cylinders and rings causig increased 
	wear. Second your exhaust system fills with gas, and at the bottom
of the hill when spark starts again
	this unburned gas blows your exhaust system off. Just what I was
told. The guy discovered one
	on a bus while I was there, and he quite violently ripped it off,
threw it outside, and stomped it into
	the dirt!
