Subject: RE: [T2] Long Mirror

Chris,

While many buses do suffer from saggy bottoms. The mirror is not a good
indicator of this condition. A bus sitting at the proper height may still
only show you the road directly behind you. That's because what you see in
the mirror is a function of the mirror position. If your bus has a rear view
mirror with a standard length stalk, as most of them have, you will only see
the road immediately behind you.

The best way to see if you have a sagging back end is to take measurements
with the bus properly loaded on level pavement. Unfortunately I don't have
these particular measurements and points to measure handy right now. Perhaps
someone reading this can supply that information.

If it turns out that your back end is sagging, the right way to correct this
is by adjusting the torsion springs. This process is a bit more involved
than installing air shocks or coil-over shocks, which by the way, is the
wrong way to compensate for worn torsion springs.
In a normally set up bus, the torsion springs support the weight of the bus.
The function of the shock absorbers is to control the bounce as you drive
over stuff. Normal shock absorbers do not support weight. The points where
the shock absorbers mount to the bus were not designed to carry the weight
of the bus. If you install coil-over shocks on a bus with very worn torsion
springs you run the risk of damaging the shock mounting points.
