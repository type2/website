Subject: Oil seal on fill tube

Chris, did the others decide that there is no oil seal
on the filler neck? According to the pictures there is
none there, hey the seal stopped it for a while, I
could swear that there was a seal there but the
pictures proved me wrong. It could be the way that you
are putting it on, they are right about the filler
neck it has a notch that the plastic part fits into,
maybe your plastic filler part is worn out, I have
another filler neck here, I'll bring it with me to
&quot;Fix yer bus&quot; this weekend at Buddah's and we will see
if it will fit any better. Phil (bear)
