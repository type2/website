Subject: 1700 and Fuel Injection???

Howdy all. My girlfriend has finally seen the light, and is selling her Nissan
to buy a really nice '79 Westy. It's pretty cheap, because it needs headwork,
and probably more. However, I have a nice 1700, from a '72, transplanted into
my old '78 automatic. I used a carb on it, but as that won't pass inspection,
I'm wondering if I can use the '79 Fuel Injection system on the 1700 engine.
Also, will it fit physically with no problems? It was fine in my '78, but that
was an automatic...
 Anyway, any advice will be greatly appreciated, as I delve into yet another
project bus!
:)
