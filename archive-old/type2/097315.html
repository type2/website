Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Wheel bearing packing tool

Sounds like a great tool.
Has anyone ever looked at adding a grease nipple to the rear hub to be able
to grease the bearings without pulling anything apart??
I've thought about putting one grease nipple in the centre on the hub, and a
removable plug on the outside of each bearing. That way, you remove one plug
at a time and pump until clean grease comes out. I was planning to look into
this if/when I replace my wheel bearings.
