I'm sure this is an easy problem to solve but I've never done any
electrical work on my bus and am kinda hesitant to go messing around with
things without knowing what I'm doing.  Hopefully one of you can help feel
a little better about what I need to be fixing.  Here's the symptoms, the
G light(generator i think) on the dash is light up and my radio, tail
lights and blinkers aren't coming on.  If i move the blinker or turn on
the radio, the light gets redder but they still don't work.  The
headlights are working though.  This all happened while I was at a
friends.  It all worked fine while I was driving over but when I got ready
to leave, the red light was on.  Thanks for any help.  Dallas
