Subject: Re: [T2] Solex versus Brosol experiences ?

It is a real pipe dream to hope for more than 20 mpg in a bus....you might 
be able to squeak it out under optimum cruising conditions on a flat road, 
but not around town for sure.  I have heard many people make claim to 
getting much more than 20, but generally find speedo issues, different sized 
tires, etc., that have skewed their results.

My beetles get close to 28 around town, but i have set them up for economy 
and have a pretty light foot.......
