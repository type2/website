&gt; I was one of the people who was supposed to buy the Westy Fabric from John Anderson that he bought
&gt; from the Trim Shop (I think).  Well that was quite a few months ago.  I know John is on the list
&gt; because I see posts from him several times a week.  However he is either not getting the e-mail I send
&gt; him or he is just ignoring it.
&gt; 
&gt; Did anyone actually get the fabric from him?  Has anyone heard from him?  Does anyone have an address
&gt; for him other than vwbus_at_netbiz_dot_net?  I've been trying to get a hold of John for a month or two now
&gt; and have had no luck.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry to waste list bandwidth but I figured someone other than the people who were buying this fabric
&gt; might be able to help me out.
&gt; 

Well I'll adress this, I bought it all and sold it to Sewfine at $20/yd.
Just kidding, I'm sorry to everyone I could make excuses but the
fact is that I'm just basically a lazy, procrastinating, SOB who has not
yet been able to get to the nearest UPS hub to get shipping prices as it
is
about an 45 min from work and I typically work till 5-5:30.  I have
the fabric, I am truly sorry, I kept meaning to reply to recent
inquiries
after getting the prices and was holding out to do so.  As I am going to
take
tomorrow afternoon off, I will go seek prices and mail them to the
concerned
parties, and if they are still interested and don't hate and begrudge me
too
much for my being an ass, you will all get your fabric promptly.  If you
don't
get a price from me by Sunday 09/22/96 please feel free to belittle me
on the
list, curse me, call me at (304)788-3704 and leave nasty phone messages,
whatever
you want.
In fact only one person has recieved their fabric and I generally am
sorry
for being myself in this matter.  Vacations and Vanagons and failure
investigations
at work took precedence but it has been terribly rude of me not to keep
people abreast of the matter.
