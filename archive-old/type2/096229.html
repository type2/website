Subject: Re: [T2] How about Imron?

&gt; Bob, Small correction here-
&gt; Imron is actually a polyurethane paint.

really, Dupont always told us it was an Epoxy

&gt; And if I can remember correctly, it isn't quite 1 to 1--it more like 3
&gt; to 1 mix, and if you want the stuff to flow out a little better
&gt; reduction is OK---

right 3-1, and yes you can reduce, can't remember the formula
&gt; 
&gt; The stuff is the most durable paint known to man---

for sure

&gt; BUT, it is Verboden to apply without a natually asperated helmit type
&gt; mask, paint suit, and rubber gloves.

again correct, although I used it once outside with just gloves and dust
mask.....wouldn't do it again that is for sure, let other people do it now

&gt; The poly isocianates will kill you period.
&gt; Nasty stuff.
&gt; It is non repairable, meaning that if one section of anything gets
&gt; screwed up--hope that there is a cut off or seam to paint to---you cnnot
&gt; blend the stuff.

again right although VW was very considerate to give you lots of seams on
the bus.  I have actually considered having my bus done with the stuff if
I ever get far enough ahead of the rust

&gt; It is a total bitch to sand--have a lot of paper on your DA, or orbital
&gt; sander--it will ball up in the paper faster than Jackie Robinson---
&gt; The stuff can be rubbed out, but there is a 10 to 12 hour window in whch
&gt; to accomplish this task--if you wait an hour longer you'll never cut the
&gt; stuff with any wet sandpaper, and your buffer will go up in smoke trying
&gt; to remve the dust nubs that may have landed in the paint.

I never tried (after the first futile attempt) get it right the first
time, period

&gt; The boat can bounce against a pier till the cows come home --and the
&gt; paint won't budge---

we used it mostly to stop grafitti

&gt; I no longer even get close to this stuff because its a pain--I have
&gt; opted to use the PPG Concept system which is a modified urethane enamel,
&gt; which is totally repairable, and no as lethal to use, lays out
&gt; beautiful, and more resonable than Imron---and it lasts just as long----

but not as graffiti resistant
&gt; 
&gt; This is alll the straight scoop---

and I'll back that up,  read and heed!
