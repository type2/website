&gt; I don't know that there is any advantage to wiring it to the coil except that
&gt; it is alot closer. In the diagram that came with the relay kit it says that 86
&gt; can be wired to any switched 12v source. Since this just powers the
&gt; relay(opens or closes it depending on the key position) I am assuming any
&gt; switched 12v supply should work which the coil is. On the  original relay it
&gt; looks as though the 86 lead was wired to the blue wire on the voltage
&gt; regulator harness, which by the Bentley goes to the dash alternator light.
&gt; That's where I tried it first but it was blowing the fuse there also. Dunno
&gt; I'm stumped.

The Westy wiring diagram says D+ (terminal 61) on the alternator is the wire
to use. Should the batteries be connected together if the alternator isn't
running? I suppose that can be debated.

It sounds like some kind of resistance in missing in the circuit. The
current that is drawn from the coil through the relay 86 to ground 85 is
obviously to be too much because the fuse is blowing. Someone else must have
had this problem...
