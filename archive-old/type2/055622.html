&gt; I heard these new Mexican 1600cc long blocks are now coming with Cast
&gt; Crankshafts?  
True.

I remember that cracking/breaking of Cast Cranks were a big
&gt; problem in the early proto-type VW engines.  They went to Forged Cranks and
&gt; thus eliminated the problem...and have used them up until recently.

This has always worried me.  Especially if you plan to use the engine in 
a bus.  The dowels tend to oval out alot easier I think.  I've never used 
a cast crank and they might be just fine, but they definitely won't be as 
strong.
