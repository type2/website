&gt; I hope this is not too dumb.  Where do you all store your wood when you go

I use a gas stove (not VW)

if I take any wood I put a piece of cardboard over the engine comp and
then dump it onto the ground as soon as I get where I'm going.  But I
rarely take much because I rarely build more than a single &quot;companionship&quot;
fire and usually it is small.
