Subject: A question about heads. Anyone in Montreal?

I have recently moved to Montreal.  My '72 bus needs the driver 
side head rebuilt or replaced.  Does anyone know of a trusted 
mechanic that could do the job in the Montreal area? 

The exhaust valve in the 3rd cylinder has been needing adjustment 
more frequently and the compression test shows it slowly getting 
lower.  It has not been using extra oil or fuel, so i'm guessing that 
its nothing more than a burnt valve. All the other cylinders are 
about 112-115 pounds but #3 is at 80.

Some of the prices I've been quoted seem very steep.  One place I 
went to wanted 800$ for a head plus labour.  I figure I could get 
mine rebuilt or buy one online for under 200$.
How many hours are involved for taking the engine out 
removing/installing a head and reinstalling the engine?

Thanks for any help.

Scott
