Subject: Low Cranking vacuum in good engine??

Hi,

We got our '68 on the road again recently and we've been checking it out. I
posted already about the unadjustable carb but no one has responded... (the
mixture adjusting screw isn't having an on our clean, rebuilt *PICT 2*
carb.)

We tested the cranking vacuum and got a low 5 Hg reading that was not steady
at all. We were confused because the engine runs so well and there's no
evidence of burning oil. We tested the compression and found that they were
110 all around to our relief... but this doesn't make sense with the
cranking vacuum being so low! We have rebuilt heads and the cam lobes looked
good, and you could still see the 'honing marks' in the cylinders... no
evidence of excessive wear...

Can anyone give us an idea as to what could be causing this low cranking
vacuum?

Here's a list of stuff we did/didn't do to the engine:
Stock 68 1600 single port fitted with doghouse cooler, fan and shroud.
 ~53,000 original miles.
 Original pistons rings barrels, crank, case rods, oil  and fuel pump
 Soaked, air compressor dryed and rebuilt carb (new gaskets, needles etc.)
 Rebuilt heads hemi cut new valves and guides.
 All new stock exhaust (tail pipe heat boxes etc.)
 Swivel balls on stock rockers.
 New clutch, all new engine seals and gaskets.
 New oil pressure relief valve and spring.


Thanks,
Jen &amp; Brett
