&gt;I am trouble shooting my '76 2000 FI (CA model) with a Pertronix 
&gt;Igniter in place of points. It won't start. The other night it as 
&gt;I drove off it was acting sluggish so I turned right around and 
&gt;parked it till it was light enough to trouble shoot. The next day 
&gt;she wouldn't start. It turns over okay, but no start.

Pertronix units are great when they're working.  But they create a whole new 
category of headaches when they're not.  

I had one in my 73 (with d-jet FI) when I moved from Texas (hot) to Colorado 
(burrrrr) in Feb 2000.  Immediately upon arrival, I started having troubles on 
cold mornings.  The bus would start up and immediately die.  If I kept starting 
it and pumping the crap out of the gas pedal, I would eventually get it to 
run.  Once it started running it would run perfect.  

I was certain it was FI related so I replaced every damned piece of that system 
one at a time to no avail.  Then summer came and the problem went away.  Until 
last winter...  Same problem.  I finally replaced the Pertronix with points and 
have had no problems since (including way too many 10 degree mornings).
