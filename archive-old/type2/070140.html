&gt; Hey Folks,
&gt;   If the pages of your Bently's don't look like they would stand up to a 
&gt; spiral binding, think about going the hardcover route.  It's a much more 
&gt; permanent measure.   Wow, a 'forever bus' and a 'forever book'! 
&gt; 
&gt; Seriously, I am the 'bindery guru' here at Draughon Library, and we can 
&gt; bind any book under three inches in width for seven bucks.  While they're 
&gt; not quite as flexible as a spiral binding, the binding methods nowadays 
&gt; do allow for a book to lay open without the help of a greasy hand (or 
&gt; tool).  I've bound a few of my most beloved softcover books, and they 
&gt; look nice.  Heck, I even got my initials placed on the spine.     
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone is interested, drop me an e-mail. 
&gt; 

So your saying that we can have &quot;The word of St Muir&quot;, &quot;Sir Bentley's
Books of Volkswagen Engineering&quot; and &quot;Hoover's Handouts&quot; inscribed on
the spine...Hey, we could even produce a yearbook of the list
;)...This may be better than bumper stickers and T-shirts!!! :-)

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!

Roy
