&gt; Greetings,

&gt; I really do try not to be negative - especially in a public forum but I
&gt; think this needs to be said about Ron and Old volks home.

WHOA!

Ron has absolutely nothing to do with .this. Old Volks Home.  (neither Ron
Salmon, or Ronnie F(?))  This OVH has been around as such a bit longer...


&gt; Sorry for the negativity on this really positive and helpful list but I
&gt; though Nikki and others considering doing business with Ron should know
&gt; this.  I had done business prior to this incident with him without any
&gt; problems.   Ut now, I would think twice before working with him again.

Again, just to point it it out, www.oldvolkshome_dot_com has nothing to do
with Ron (presumably ROn Salmon of Bus Depot (www.busdepot_dot_com))

OVH (was) is run solely by Jim Thompson.



later....david
