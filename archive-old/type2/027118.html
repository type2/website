I would add to the previous suggestions, that you apply some WD-40 or other 
thin rust penetrant to the circumferences of the holes out of which the two 
screws that appear to hold the drum to its flange were removed. Apply is to 
the seam between the inner surface of the drum and the outside surface of 
the flange, which is the interface where the rust has developed. It doesn't 
take very much penetrant, obviously, to start the derusting process but if 
you keep applying the penetrant and rotating the wheel around every hour or 
so it ultimately will dissove the bond and, accompanied by the hammering, 
release the drum.
