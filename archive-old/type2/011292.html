Subject: RE: Replacing the Cam
Date: Wed, 26 Jul 2000 14:34:04 US/Mountain

&gt;I just got the news yesterday that i might have a bad cam in the old
&gt;1600cc dual port. my mechanic has run his battery of tests, with a few
&gt;more to do, but as of yesterday, its either a bad cam, or hopefully, a
&gt;bad valve. I will know for sure today. But for the purpose of this

A very important point to remember when diagnosing a bad cam:  If you have a 
very flat lobe on the cam, TWO valves will be affected!  Think about it.  There 
are 8 valves in your engine, right?  4 intakes and 4 exhausts.  But there are 
only FOUR lobes on the cam.  Each lobe drives a pair of valves - one on each 
side of the engine.  So if you have a bad cam, 1 valve on each opposing side of 
the engine will be affected.

I thought I had a bad cam on a type IV motor for weeks.  Turned out to be a 
severe leak at the intake manifold on one side.
