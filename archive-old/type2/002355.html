&gt;My wild guess is that the 4500rpm limiter rotor is for type 1 engines and
&gt;the 5400rpm is for type 4. Think they are interchangeable. I allways put


I missed the origional bit but if we are talking of the neat centrifugal
limiting rotors they are in fact available in a smear of ranges from
3500-5500 or so in 500 rpm increments.  Gene Berg used to carry them,
probably still does, and I notice Automotion lists one for the 914 but fails
to mention it's rpm.  All around $30 US as I recall.  Or put in a MSD 6AL
and get rev limiting as a byproduct.  Which brings on a question would it be
damaging in any way to use one of the rotors with a regular non limiting
electronic or CD ignition of some sort, damaging to the ignition that is,
say an MSD 6A or the stock CA Vanagon or whatever, the sort of ignition that
carries warnings about not pulling plugs without grounding them.
