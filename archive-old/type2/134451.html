  2) Air somewhere - bleed
 left front brake works, better than the right.
 Bleed the entire system, longest line (RR ) first.
 If the brake fluid is discolored, change it.

 When the brakes have not been used in the last 10 seconds, pedal goes to
 about 1/2 and then bus brakes OK but steers to the left.

 When the brakes have been used in the last 10 seconds, pedal goes only to
 about 1/3, feels fantastically solid and bus stops really fast and remains
 straignt.

 I am getting used to do a quick &quot;pressure up the brakes&quot; when I feel I'll
 need the fantastic stopping power. It would be even better to have the
 fantastic stopping power always ready to serve.

 My preferred explanations (by order of preference)

 1) Collapsed brake lines - replace
 2) Air somewhere - bleed
 3) Faulty master cylinder (that valve that is supposed to keep pressure up
 in the system, however it does not explain the left steering)- replace
