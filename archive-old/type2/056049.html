Subject: Re: Finding TDC

&gt;&gt;My 1981 Westy with a 2.0 l FI engine has a convenctional ignition system.
I was told my a local mechanic that the general rule of thumb for your
distributor cap wiring is to have the number 1 Ht lead segment in the cap
should point towards the number 1 cylinder.  My number 1 lead points
towards the rear of the engine compartment.  Can this be right?  &lt;&lt;

For firing #1,The contact part of the rotor should point to the mark on the
distributor body, and #1 wire in cap should be at that point.  As I recall,
the rotor should point roughly to 4 o'clock when you have #1 at TDC.  I
doubt that your distributor is turned, since in the type 4, there is very
little room for the vacuum canister.  If #1 is in the rear, more likely
your plug wires are 180 degrees off.  The notch on the crank fan should
also line up with zero on the degree scale- did you rotate the fan another
180 degr. to see if there is a mark?  If so, You may have to move each wire
back 2 posts- the notch on the fan lines up with zero  for #1 and also #3,
and 2, 4 will line up (when strobe would flash) exactly 180 degrees from
notch.   Turn the crank counterclockwise, and watch rotor turn- that way
also- it's moving now 90 degrees from 1 to 2, etc.  The fan edge will move
180 degr from #1 to 2.  When the rotor is at around 4 o'clock you should
have #1 at TDC , see a notch, and that's where #1 plug wire must be.
No notch?  To make sure you are at #1, yes COMPRESSION means piston is
coming up with valves closed.  TDC is simply when that piston is at its
highest - easy to figure out when someone is rotating the crank back and
forth while you stick a dowel in there and watch it for &quot;peak extrusion&quot;
from plug hole!  #1 is on pass. side, near FRONT of engine.
     Yes, before figuring out why it's not starting, get the
ignition/tuning in order- pull the center wire out of the distributor and
with well shielded hands (rubbercoated plier) hold it near ground while
someone cranks- you should see 4 blue sparks per revolution that can jump
1/4&quot;!.  If you pull #1 plug wire you can hold that to ground (yank other 3
from distr), but since the plug is so deep, you need either a nail in there
or an old plug you can lay against ground and watch the spark.  Extend the
gap on the plug to 1/8&quot; so you can see if electricals (coil, etc) are
strong and make a nice blue spark or a wimpy orange one.  The spark should
coincide with the notch coming around on the fan to the top- a white dab of
paint makes this very visible.
