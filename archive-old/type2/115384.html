Subject: Cold Start  Valve

How can I check to see if my cold start valve is leaking??

I checked the library and read Sean Barnik's explaination on the thermo time 
switch and cold start valve. (Sean says, RE: Cold Start Valve - &quot;It can be 
tested in the same manner as the other injectors. Leakage is undesirable as 
it will cause the engine to run rich.&quot;)

I am wondering if I am getting too rich a mixture that is causing me to 
stall when I stop the vehicle, or  slow to almost stop.

I. e., 2 or 3 seconds later, after I stall, I get the smell of 'fuel' from 
the defrost vents (wired for the winter, and the fan is always running, warm 
air from engine compartment to vents pronto.)

I know, CSV only fires 10 secs max, and only when engine key is on start 
position.  But Sean says the CSV gets it's electrical impulse from the 
double relay, and if my termo time switch (ground for CSV) is also bad, 
couldn't this cause CSV to dump fuel into engine??

It could be that one went bad, and nothing reulted, but if the other went 
bad also, I would be bonkers on my CSV.

My motor is uncharacteristically cool.  In the Spring, it was running hot as 
a $2 pistol.  I found vacuum leaks, and thought that was my answer.

Now, I am balking when I snap my footoff teh gas pedal at 60MPH, and 
stalling just before I come to a stop.  Only when warm.

Thanks
