Subject: i need new carb???

Good day again

Well, now i am pretty sure i have carb(S) problem...

I have dual Solex 32-34 on my 73 1700cc, they are at the end of there
life. (even if i have 2 spare one)

I would like to stay away from dual carb (i want reliability and
simplicity more than power)

Can i put a single carb? if yes, i will need a new 2 in 1 intake system
(as i have dual now), where to buy, which company (Weber or else).

Should i also change my distributor (as i have a dual vacuum advance
distributor)  for a 009 or any point-less one.

Any input guys!

Regards, Ben
