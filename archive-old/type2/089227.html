I like this one best of all! The &quot;Whatwagen&quot;! It sort of resembles the
symbol that Prince used before he coined the name &quot;The Artist Formerly Known
As Prince&quot;. (Yes, we are back to that again, and I think it was the
&quot;artist&quot;, rather than the &quot;entertainer&quot;).
It does imply that we are having an identity crisis, and that pretty well
sums it up. It's almost like we're being disowned by the VW family..
Disinherited by their lawyers.
