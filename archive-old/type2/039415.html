Subject: RE: damaged nose on '79 

&gt; California Imports sells the
&gt; nose panel for less than $200.


I sell it for closer to $100.  It's on the specials sheet that comes with my
catalog, and also on the website, for $139.95 + shipping.  Bear in mind that
you can also use part of the panel, rather than welding it on in its
entirity.  For example, I have seen people use only the upper half to fix
under-windshield rust, or just use a portion of it to repair a dent.
