Subject: Re: [T2] Re: spare tire well

Hi Mick,
The sliding door, rear hatch and engine lid seals all fit into a shaped grove which will hold the seal in place with out any glue at all.
The same is in thory true for the cab doors although its not very successful just below the windows at the front of the door.
Where seals have needed to be stuck I've used &quot;Evo Stick&quot; sucessfuly.

Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; I get water in the corners of the back area (including the spare tire well) 
&gt; after a heavy rain or a high-pressure wash. I'm fairly sure the culprit is a 
&gt; worn-out hatch seal. When I open the back hatch after a wash, I can see 
&gt; where the water has infiltrated the seal at the top corners. So I bought a 
&gt; new one and plan to stick it in there real soon.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm wondering what types of adhesives people have used to replace this seal 
&gt; ... or the sliding door seal, which is similar in design. Any advice will be 
&gt; much appreciated.
&gt;
