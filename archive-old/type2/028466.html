&gt; &gt;The type 4 engine does have fairly high
&gt; &gt;compression, you wouldn't run a 60's muscle car on low octane would you?

the highest compresion &quot;Stock&quot; in a VW ac engine was the 1500S engine.
never offically exported to the USA, less than 10,000 ever built...12.8-1
was the claimed Compression Ratio.

I had to put 102 octane in mine to keep it from knocking!!!
