Would that be chasis 100229 or 000229?

Al has a good point about it getting titled incorrectly from the 
beginning. Perhaps it lingered on the lot after the 69 model year 
buses were in and the dealer did it for loan purposes.

&gt;&gt;  A Bus chassis number is registered as '69, but the VIN is 228 100 229. Can a
&gt;  &gt; bus be built in '68 and have the vin of a '68, but be registered as a '69?
