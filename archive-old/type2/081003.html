Subject: What time is it?

  I've looked through the archives, and the library, but I don't see the =
specs for this distributor.
                                                    vw113 905 205 AA
How should I set the advance on this distributor?

 Also, I have around the garage.... 113 905 205 T ,  043 905 205 , and a =
few 009s I know, I know.

 I hope not to start yet another dizzy thread so maybe someone will let =
me know off list
which of these would be most suitable for my 1600 dp with Webber prog., =
extractor header, and
Pertronics points eliminator, for my 70' Kobi with a M.T.

Thanks, Jack=20
