Subject: NJ Bug FS

I havent pesonaly seen the bug in question however I do know the seller
and he is a seriously straight forward shoot form the hip tell it like
it is sort of guy so if you have any questions  just  e-mail him  and I
am sure he will tgive it to you straight, photos are up at
http://www.mmxpress_dot_com/MMXBUG.jpg and he said  &quot;Im trying to get $2200
for it. WELL worth it. SOLID floors too. All redone.&quot; when I talked to
him about it, and form the images I have seen of it I believe him. And
for those of you that like tunes when you drive, considering that he
runs a car audio business, it probly has a rather nice set up in it.

if your interested in it you can email him at mailto:john_at_mmxpress_dot_com
to get more information on it.
