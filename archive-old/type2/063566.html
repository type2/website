Subject: Why adjust valves?

When you are adjusting valves on your VW, you are setting the gap between 
the tip of your valve adjusting screw and the top of the valve stem. Why 
leave a .006&quot; gap on something that should be in direct contact? 

The reason, as I understand it, is to compensate for the expansion of 
metal when the engine is at operating temperatures. When the valves help 
to remove heat from the cylinders, they are expanding in length. 
Orginally VW specified a .004&quot; gap in between the stem and adjustment 
screw, but because in the US market we generally drove our engines longer 
and harder, they changed the specs to (.006&quot;) so that the engines 
wouldn't konk out quicker.

So this begs the question, would the addition of sodium-filled or 
mercury-filled valves, which have the ability to more efficiently channel 
heat out of the combustion chamber, change the gap between stem and 
adjusting screw? 

I know the answer is probably no, but I'd be interested in why?
