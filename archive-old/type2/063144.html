Subject: KYB shocks

Hellooooo all...
I got around to attempting to install my rear KYB's. The old shock
was in such poor condition that it would not have surprised me
if it was the origonal. So anyway, here is my quandry. The 
bolt that holds th top of the shock gets wider where the threads
end as you get closer to the head. In the origonal shock it fit
into the rubber bushing on the shock. On the KYB it will not
go through. Can I just go and get a bolt that will go through
from the local hardware store? It appears that the origonal
shock mounted snug against the body, and that this would be
ok. Any thoughts??????? TIA

BTW after pulling my rear wheels (which were tourqed way to tight
and took me, my 1/2 drive wrench, a 3/4 in socket, and about a 
4 ft cheater to loosen) I could see my engine much better and
it appears that my oil leaks are coming from the standard 
places of the push rod tubes and the valve cover gaskets....:)
