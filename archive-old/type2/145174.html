Subject: Re: [T2] Shifting

hey mike i like the 15-30-45 alot better and the bus seems happy with it also....
  i had been going 20-35-50 but that was way to high just from what i THINK! 
  i ended up and liked the 15-30-45 alot better...
  i went from using a 2liter also to now running a 1.8 liter engine...
  i was told once bus engines liked high rpms to me though 15-30-45 is just smooth and very suitable and not to high at all like i was told once from someone i didnt really know anyways... but at that time was a mechanic in nc....
  peace
  chai

  I've been putting up with my boss complaining about how I over-rev my '77
when I shift. I've been using the Muir pattern, 15-30-45. I tried shifting
at lower speeds this morning, 15-25-30, on my way home from dropping my son
off at school, but it seemed a bit sluggish or &quot;slow&quot;.

But then I realized that I no longer have the original 2.0L. I had it
replaced by a rebuilt 1.8L.

Am I shifting at the right speeds?
