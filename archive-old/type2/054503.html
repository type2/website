Subject: Re:Torque wrenches and Pressure Plate

You need to set these to the spec'd torque... mondo important.

You really *do* need to get a torque wrench and do it right... Sears has 
them, click style (my favorite as more accurate) or pointer kind... not too 
expensive... definately cheaper than the clutch parts!!!  Also you will find 
you end up using it for everything (almost) and *know that 1-the parts won't 
come apart, 2-the bolt holes won't strip, and 3- things that need to be 
tightened evenly (like disk brake wheel studs, flywheel bolts, etc) will be 
even.
