My first AIRS call!

After work Monday night the phone rings and I hear from Nick and Jason;  two
college kids from Nebraska.  They're here in Cooperstown with a brake
problem on a white over red '71 bus.  Nick was familiar with the list, (had
met Isiah in Wisconson and someone else up in Portland, Maine) but wasn't a
member of AIRS.  (Promised he will sign up after his trip.)  Just like AIRS
is supposed to work, I tell'em to come on over and we take a look at it.
Blown, leaking wheel left rear wheel brake cylinder - one of them had
already diagnosed it and gotten the part - so we spent the evening setting
up in the driveway and pulling and replacing the cylinder.  Only the usual
trouble with drum brakes, no catastrophes.

Got some takeout food, and they slept in their bus and my bus in the
driveway, had breakfast and lunch here and visited our local museum and then
were on there way, towards NYC.  They're traveling around the country and I
hope you get a chance to met them.

My thanks (and their's too) for Wade and Charlie and all the other AIRS
volks.
