It was brought to my attention this weekend that I'm missing some
cooling tin on my bus. Apparently there are pieces that bolt to the
underside of the motor, between the heater boxes. Does this sound
right? Having never seen them installed, I'm not sure what they're
supposed to look like. Do any of you have a photo of the properly
installed pieces that you can send me? I'd like to get this remedied
as soon as possible, although I haven't noticed any hot-running
characteristics so far. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks-
