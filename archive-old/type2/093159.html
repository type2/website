Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Tin &amp; POR-15


&gt;My engine's out, and I'm thinking of cleaning up and painting the rusty tin
&gt;while the engine's at AVP. I wanted to slap on some basic rust treatment,
&gt;but I'm planning on doing a full restoration in about five years, with
&gt;POR-15 on everything.  In the meantime, I'm in a preservation mode with  my
&gt;bus.  If I clean the tin, apply &quot;Extend&quot;-type rust inhibitor and spray
&gt;paint, will this make it harder to do the POR-15 treatment in a few years?
&gt;I think the tin would probably last that long  without treatment, so I could
&gt;hold off if necessary.

I've used EXTEND with wonderful results. It is good but needs to be 
topcoated to seal it. It sands easily just like regular paint.

Go to it. By the way I've used spray paint and I've powdercoated tin. Both 
have offered excellent results without the rust converter.
