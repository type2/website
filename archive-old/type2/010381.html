Danny/All,


Sounds as if the electrical portion of the switch is
no longer mating properly with the mechanical portion,
or is flat-out shot.

I had this problem on my '69 Westy. I spent an entire
3 hours trying to get the damned switch out, but to no
avail. I'm now very happy I wasn't able to; I fixed it
with a .07$ zip-tie (the kind used for
electrical-wiring bundles)! 

Loosen your steering column so you can get to the
switch and push the red (electrical) portion in with
your finger while turning the key. If this works, grab
a zip-tie and pocket the extra cash as well as the
unnecessary headaches! Don't get it too tight,
though...otherwise, the key will stay in the &quot;start&quot;
position and cause the starter to grind!

Hope this works.

&gt; On occasion I've had to turn my steering wheel a tad
&gt; while turning the key

&gt; of those Reindeer games
&gt; and won't start at all - full power to everything
&gt; electric - just no go.  I
&gt; ended up wiggling the key in some pretty odd
&gt; patterns until it would engage.
&gt; 
&gt; I have proper voltage at both ends of the bus - am I
&gt; looking at a short of
&gt; some kind in the key-switch it self?
&gt; 
&gt; Bob Wallace has a good article in the archives on
&gt; how to tear it down - just
&gt; wanting to know if this registers with any bussers
&gt; in audience today that
&gt; have already gone through this and done the
&gt; procedure - any words of wisdom
&gt; to diag this.
&gt;
