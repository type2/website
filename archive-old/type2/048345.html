Subject: [T2]  Mystery clutch slippage

Ok, here’s one for which I need as many ideas as possible:

I have a ’71 Westy; 1776 engine and freeway flyer tranny.

When I installed the tranny 3 months ago, I had to replace the old-style
(collared) clutch pressure plate with a new style (collarless) plate I
pulled off an engine in the yard.

I had slippage in the clutch; no amount of cable adjustment would correct
the problem.

Figuring that the (used) pressure plate was weak, I ordered a new, heavy
duty plate, and threw on a new clutch disk and throw-out bearing just for
good measure. When I pulled the engine, I also wiped down the contact
surfaces on the flywheel and new pressure plate with rubbing alcohol to get
them good and clean.(The flywheel surface seemed a little shiny to me, but
there wasn't any oil or other foreign substance on it, and I didn't give it
a second thought once I wiped it clean. Should I have &quot;sanded&quot; the contact
surfaces?)

Here’s the rub: I installed the new hardware last Wednesday, and I still
have
slippage. I checked the cable run; there is no binding (ruling out this
source of inadequate engagement). I have adjusted the cable so that my pedal
free-play was as long as possible (thus ruling out inadequate free-play as a
cause of inadequate engagement).

I’m just baffled. Obviously the clutch is not fully engaging, or it is not
gripping the contact surfaces with sufficient friction. It is also obvious
that I will be pulling the engine again very soon to try to fix the problem.
But before I do that, I was hoping that a few folks on the list might
suggest some potential causes and remedies, so that when I tear everything
down I have a list of things to look for.

Again, the clutch cable and the cable adjustment are not the problem. Any
ideas?

All comments and suggestions would be immensely appreciated
