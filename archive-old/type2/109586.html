Subject: Fw: [T2] Head/Tin Question

It's been a few weeks since I looked,
and hopefully someone will correct this ( if I'm wrong:), but-
The deflector tins are left and right. Try reversing them.

Subject: [T2] Head/Tin Question


&gt; Ok, I've run into a slight problem with the rebuild of my 2.0. The first
&gt; question... are the heads basically the same? Meaning can I put them on
&gt; either side of the engine? The reason I ask this is I've put the heads on
&gt; the engine and now am trying to put the deflector tin that screws onto the
&gt; case and the heads and I can't get the screw holes to align.
