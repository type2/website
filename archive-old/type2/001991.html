My baby is on it's originals and doing fine (only 59K), but for my money,
new rotors, and even calipers if necessary, are cheap if you put them on
yourself (easy to do).  Brakes, you know...  really good to know they're
100% or close to it.  Buses, leg exposure and all that.  It's your money,
I'm trying not to preach, believe it or not.
