&gt; I subscribe to a mailing list for drivers of older Volkswagen buses. It

&gt;
&gt; I can't say I'm terribly enthusiastic about that goal. Is it true? Any
&gt; chance you might stay busy trying to get car manufacturers to part with
&gt; profits building huge SUVs for yuppies to drive (and drive into ditches,
&gt; thinking they're invulnerable? ha! ha! ha!).
&gt;
&gt; I like my '76 Volkswagen. I spend over $700 getting it smogged last
&gt; year. I have zero interest in parting with it, ever.


Dear Mr. Wagner:

Thank you for contacting us.  We appreciate your candor in writing about
this important topic; however, it is news to me that this agency (for which
I have worked, for the most part, since 1982) has any kind of agenda for
&quot;removing vehicles from the roads&quot; per se.  It is anticipated that there
will be improved air quality as the California fleet &quot;turns over&quot; (older
vehicle are retired and replaced by newer ones), but I can assure you that
there is no effort to target any particular vehicle brand, make, age, etc.

On the other hand, I have seen, in print (statements in newsletters, for
instance) certain allegations that are totally untrue about the Air
Resources Board.  So, we do appreciate your &quot;coming to the source&quot; to find
out what is going on--most people don't do that!

Incidentally, if you type SUV into the search engine on our website
(http://www.arb_dot_ca_dot_gov), you will see that we have been actively working
with SUV manufacturers to bring them into the same arena as other automakers
when it comes to air pollutant emissions.  Be sure and read the press
release that followed our Board meeting last November.

If you would like someone to call you to discuss ARB programs regarding
older vehicles, for example, our pilot program for accelerated vehicle
retirement in southern California, just let me know.  And if there is any
other way we can be of assistance to you, we're as close as an e-mail or a
telephone call....the way I see it, I work for you.

Sincerely, Jon Pederson, Helpline Services,
California Air Resources Board
