Subject: Spray Guns was DIY Bus Painting

&quot;Just got a flyer in the mail, advertising the opening of a Horrible 
Freight 
store in the Glen Burnie area, on Ritchie Hwy = Rte 2, just north of 
I695, 
according to their map.  Sure hope this does not mean we will have to 
pay sales 
tax on Internet purchases from HF&quot;
 
I thought they already had a store in B-more and have not been charging tax on internet, so maybe they wont start. 
 
Anyone have products to tout for sealer, primers, acrylic enamels? Looking at PPG stuff I guess...
Getting the doors stripped down and will be ready to start spraying sealer next week. I am going to order an HVLP gun that I can get replacement parts for as well as different sized nozzles for spraying different viscosity paints. The HF guns are cheap but i don't know if they can be repaired or ifyou can get nozzles of different sizes to fit them...
