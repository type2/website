Subject: Re: [T2] [t2]Rebuilt engine still stalls

I hope your fuel system is in good shape. Symptoms of flooding are
like symptoms of running lean. But flooding won't seize your engine,
running lean will. Always fix the cause of a failed engine before
running the new engine, or the new engine will just suffer the same
fate (unless everything was fine and your old engine died of old age).
If you suspect flooding, check for black smoke from the exhaust.

Your symptoms also are similar to those of a clogged catalytic converter.

Check Phil's ideas too.

 So I just got my brand spankin new engine back from
 the shop and low and behold, I'm still having problems
 with it.  The guy said it would be rough, since it
 still needs to be tuned, but it's not even drivable.
 Here's the predicament:  I'll be driving along, and
 the engine will start to slow down (feels like it did
when it seized) and no matter how much gas I give it,
 it refuses to speed up.    If I put it in neutral, it
 stalls out completely.  Then, once it's stalled out,
 it refuses to start.  I think the reason for that is
 that I've flooded the engine from giving it too much
 gas, but the first part has got me perplexed.  Any
 ideas??
