Hi All...

The battery in my 71 bus is not staying charged. It is
a new battery ( 2nd new battery ) and I have a brand
new alternator ( generator has been converted ). after
charging the battery it is completely dead in about 2
days. All wiring in the engine compartment looks fine.
I'm figuring that something is drawing power from the
battery but am no sure where to start looking. 

Any help would be appreciated!
