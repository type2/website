&gt;I heard a rumor that they aren't going to do Buses on the Blue Ridge
&gt;anymore because it has just gotten out of hand.

I spoke with Neil Pickett, the organizer of Buses on the Blue Ridge, 
earlier this year and he had not decided what he was going to do yet.

He started BotBR as a split window bus gathering (he is the head of 
the Appalachian Split Screens, the NC chapter of NEATO) and it just 
grew into &quot;something else&quot;.

Last year at least one person went to jail and there were complaints 
about the noise in the campground.  The group photograph was not 
allowed because a &quot;parade&quot; permit would have been required.

One thing he knows for sure is it will NOT be held in the campground 
across from the Pisgah Inn, due to the hassles of Federal Property and 
the Park Service.  He is looking for private land to hold it on, and if 
he finds a big enough area, everyone may be welcome.  But it may end up 
being &quot;invitation only&quot; or &quot;split bus only&quot;.

Not that he wants to be a snob or anything (Neil owns an '81 Westy), 
but he wants to keep it smaller and sort of take it back to it's roots.

That doesn't mean everyone else can't &quot;end up&quot; at the Pisgah campground, 
by coincidence, on the same weekend...
