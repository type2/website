&gt; This is what I was told Tony---
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not a Jaguar expert.
&gt; 
&gt; 
 Neither am I, but '61 is the first year of production for the
Jaguar E-series (XK-E)... Might be a very rare D-type or an
even rarer XKSS, but both of those models were racers and
the surviving ones are &quot;known&quot;. Might be a '59 XK-150, not
as rare but very pricy...Or, it might be an XKE, but the year
is wrong...
 BTW, have fun if you get the Mini...I've had a couple of them
over the years...Including a &quot;Traveler&quot; (You do know about
&quot;Minimania&quot; in California... ?-)
