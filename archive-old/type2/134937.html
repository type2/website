Subject: Pulling a Vintage RV with a Bus

I am restoring a '73 Standard Bus.
My kids want to go camping with it but my wife won't camp without a toilet 
with us (and not a westy portable deal).
As a convenient asside I have been thinking of getting a vintage Airstream 
RV...the aluminum toaster camper type.
So, I'm thinking of buying a Vintage early 70s Airstream...maybe a 17' or 
20' long RV.

So I need the list's expertise. How much weight could I pull with a '73 VW 
Bus? I'm thinking of one of the hitch types that replaces the bumper 
brackets.

Peace,
