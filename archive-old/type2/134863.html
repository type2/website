Subject: Re: [T2] Headlight Switch or wiring causing Power Drain

&gt; As it turns out, neither my battery, not my Alternaor or regulator are
&gt; bad.  I had the battery tested at Advance and it tested good.  Then they
&gt; wheeled out the machine for the alternator and it tested good at 13.5
&gt; volts *until* I turned on the headlights.  Then, there was a setady
&gt; voltage decline, immediatley to 12.5 and varying there for the few minutes
&gt; that it was tested.

Call me crazy, but is that not a normal voltage drop?  As a paramedic ive 
noticed in ambulance (always equipped with voltmeters) that a 1v voltage 
drop is normal when head and running lights are on?  I could be wrong as I 
have no evidence. YMMV.

Matt
