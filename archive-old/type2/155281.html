&gt;I must be the minority that would vote for stock carbs. The dual 
&gt;carbs were used in the UK
&gt;for many more years and there are vedors there who can provide them. 

Some parts of Europe might be a better source than UK since the vehicle tax structure meant that more 1600cc single carb beetle engines were installed in 72-79 baywindows than the CJ Type 4 engine.

&gt;1) ECU placement. I would cut and splice in the proper metal from an FI Bus.

Wouldn't it be easier to just cut the slot and two holes for the the bolts than cut up two buses?

&gt;4) The components for the 1800 FI will not correctly feed a 1700 
&gt;engine. If you go with all 1800 FI
&gt;parts, you will still not have a proper mount for the head temp 
&gt;sender,

Just tap the hole to the left of the intake?

&gt;5) Get the adjustable fuel pressure regulator from an early 914 
&gt;Porsche. Should be able to drop
&gt;the fuel pressure with that to tune the 1800 FI to the 1700 engine. 
&gt;Using an exhaust gas meter, set
&gt;the mixture screw on the AFM to about 2 turns up from bottom, then 
&gt;adjust the fuel pressure regulator,
&gt;reducing pressure until the mixture leans out. Then use the mixture 
&gt;screw to make the final adjustment.

This I don't understand. Why forgo the vacuum control of the pressure regulator and then adjust the idle mixture? Why not adjust the wiper inside the AFM and then check the exhaust as you rev the engine?

&gt;In the end, new stock carbs from the UK will likely be less costly, 
&gt;and when set up properly that 1700
&gt;will run like a champ, just like the engineers who designed it 
&gt;thought it should run like.  

I think they are just importing the same Brosol &quot;Kadrons&quot; we get.

&gt;Converting a carb motor with carb heads and carb cam to FI IS second guessing 
&gt;the designers. That's why I advise it will be far less costly in time/money 
&gt;to just pay the cost of putting it back stock. 

If the Type 4 cam was virtually universal and the 1800cc engine ran both carbs and FI from the factory, it seems adapting the parts like Greg did would have good results.
