Subject: Bus Tires

Those Hankooks don't exist. I know because I tried
every trick I could think of to find them on the
Hankook website and they simply don't exist. Same goes
for Cooper Explorers, Goodrich Commercial TA's, and
especially the Nokians that I have on my bus in
winter... They don't exist!

Before I get too far into this, Bus Depot does have
access to some of these tires that the manufacturers
deny having!

Why is it that our little slice of marketplace has
been overlooked on most if not all the tire websites?
Apparently we don't buy enough tires. I have tried to
buy tires (locally - Seattle area) but the dealers
can't find them. The only way I was able to get my
Nokians was to email Nokian directly - to which I got
a next-day reply - to tell the dealer how to get the
tires! I had been to three Nokian authorized dealers
in person and was told to my face that those tires
were not imported to the U.S. I was told by my local
Discount Tires dealer that the tires I wanted were not
the tires I wanted and that they couldn't get them
anyway. They were interested at least, and easy to get
to (next door to my work) so I ended up buying from
them.

Look for the Yokohamas or the Hankooks or really, any
of the 185R14, 195/70R14 tires and what do you find?
You have to enter information in their search engine.
Decide from a vehicle selection that starts at 1987.
Decide from a tire size selection that starts at 205
width or has no provision for selecting load range or
demands a profile selection when there is no &quot;blank&quot;
available (and usually no &quot;80&quot;.)

Look at how many tires were available just a few years
ago and what is available now. You used to be able to
choose. Now tire manufacturers are discontinuing sales
of these tires probably because they don't sell. They
don't seem to realize that they don't sell because of
stinking rotten marketing and distribution practices!
Build it and they will come - but not if they keep
getting told by your own people that it doesn't exist!
The last probably 4 tire purchases I made have been
for tires that I was first told did not exist. The
only people that seem to want to sell our sizes is
Michelin and for some reason, I don't want anything to
do with them! I don't know why - maybe it's that when
I was buying Goodrich TA Commercial 195/70 R14's for
$49.95 the closest Michelin was $115.

I have no gripe whatsoever against Ron and his Bus
Depot but they are east coast. I'm west coast. I want
to buy my tires from a local dealer. I also want to
support the people who support our &quot;hobby&quot; or
&quot;addiction!&quot; so I suspect that next spring I'll likely
buy a set of non-existent tires from Bus Depot and
have them put on by my FLATS (Friendly Local Tire
Store) at a premium price - only to be told
afterwards, &quot;You know, we could've gotten those tires
for you...&quot;

The Information Highway has a lot of neat stuff going
for it, including forums such as the Type 2 List, but
it seems that as much information as is available,
there is an exponentially larger amount of
misinformation. Anybody else run into this? -BaH
