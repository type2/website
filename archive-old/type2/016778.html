&gt; Any thoughts about painting the fiber glass like these people did:

&gt; 
&gt; It would probably look nicer since my top is worn a bit, and special kinds of
&gt; paint?  Should it be primed?

I painted mine and it turned out really nice. I used the same paint that
I used on the bus, no primer. I found that it works best to paint it
once and then sand it down quick with something like 150 grit to get rid
of the fuzzies, then paint it again.
