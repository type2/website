Subject: What is this??? anyone know?

Hello List,

I came across some brackets that were in a box when I
bought my bus a few years ago. Can anyone tell me what
they are for? Here is a link to a picture of them.

They were with some carburetor parts but I couldn't
find any way that they attached to the carbs. Any
thoughts???

Thanks!

David Kelly
