Subject: Tinted Sliders w/ screens or Jalousies?

Hey all,

I have a van with tinted sliders with screens.  They were made by a
company called &quot;Huhn&quot;, and definitely not stock, probably custom made. 
This van also has a sliding window for the farthest rear passenger side
window, made by &quot;Huhn&quot; as well.

I was wondering of I should hold onto these middle sliders (I am
definitely holding onto the farthest rear slider) and install them into my
westy, or, should I just stay jalousie with screens and rebuild them (and
get them tinted)?

What does everyone think?

Thanks,

Mark
