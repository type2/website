&gt;Any idea what oil cooler I should buy for my air cooled westy?

&gt;So far I like the 
&gt;Race-Trim? Oil Cooler Systems at:
&gt;http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/oilcoolingremote.htm

yes sort of.

&gt;Maxi-Cool Six Pass or Maxi-Cool 16 Pass Oil Cooler

no.

The standard ole biggest or next to biggest size &quot;plate style&quot; cooler 
fits very nicely back in the rear corner of a Vanagon FWIW.  You can 
cut a large acess hole with a sawz-all or jig-saw back in the left rear 
corner beside the engine (take out the tailight for acess to see what 
you are doing.  Cut the hole big enough that there is a nice overlap 
lip about 1&quot; all the way round around the cooler to sit on, and the 
cooler will just fit back there, use right angle adapters off the 
cooler and route the hoses carefully through grommets in the tin.  I 
mean to put it opposite where the computer is on the passenger side, 
but down on the bottom of the compartment, the ECU is up on top on the 
other side.  I then used a $5 pick and pull radiator fan off a Nissan 
of some sort (about 8&quot; diameter) on top, with a thermostat switch from 
Jeg's.  (Jeg's sells nice B&amp;M plate style coolers BTW.)  Anyway this 
dropped temps of the flying pig '82 auto Westy from 250-270 (the higher 
if you went over 65 or up big grades) down to a pretty solid 210-230 
under the same conditions.  Without the fan it did well enough with the 
ram effect at speed but nothing (or maybe even worse preheated intake 
cooling air) sitting in traffic.  Anyway get the kind of the one from 
Bus Boys, but their price is ridiculous, the whole kits for 96 plate go 
for about $99 with the adapter and hose from most VW parts houses.  I 
think the B&amp;M from Jeg's is a bit better quality than most VW parts 
houses.  For the ultimate in slick (which I didn't do) Neuspeed sells a 
thermostatic adapter plate for Rabbit/Golf/Jetta etc.  It would spin 
right onto the bus as well (you can use a rabbit filter on a bus) but I 
don't know and won't swear if the hoses would fit and route OK, should 
it looks just like a normal adapter plate but costs about $80?  Slick 
but I've done fine without a thermostat if you want one external from 
Jeg's again is cheaper than most other sources, or just warm it up.  
Anyway my experience and thoughts.  Also FWIW a single 2&quot; VDO gage fits 
nicely between the clock and speedo underneath the &quot;idiot lights&quot; great 
location for your oil temp gage but make sure you look at the back of 
the cluster (with it removed and foil removed) and MEASURE TWICE, CUT 
ONCE with a hole cutter (I obviously went through two clusters 8-) and 
I measured twice the first time and still F'd one up.
