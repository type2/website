not sure what dizzy you have over there, but from my experience i have
three lubrication points to check each year: one is the round, felt pad
below the rotor; then the little ball under the cup (grease); and finally
there's a hole on the plate that gets a squirt to keep the two plates from
ginding. AND, it cured my hesitation....my dizzy plates were so tweeked,
that i ultimately lost vacuum advance.    - steve
