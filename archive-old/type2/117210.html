Subject: Points typical useful life?

Just curious as to how long a set of points on average lasts for most
folks. Type 4 2.0 FI motor. I have about 12K on my rebuild now and set the
points before a trip to RI from DC. The dwell had been close to 60 so I got
it back to 50 then reset the timing. I never actually looked at the points
to see if they were pitted or anything, just regapped them. So on the way
home from RI I got an occassional hiccup like a misfire or something but
only every 20 -30 minutes and opnly one hiccup at a time. Just enough to
keep me nervous... I have not really driven the bus much since then and
yesterday I pulled the points to have a look and they seem about done. Some
pitting on one side. Before I pulled them the dwell was back up to 56 and
the timing had retarded to around TDC from 7.5 ATDC. The points dont look
really cooked just plain worn out. I guess I could file them but it's cheap
enough to replace. So my question is this: Is 12k about right for point
life? I am planning on going to electronic one day soon but I really can't
complain much since thats the only time in 12k that I ever touched my
points. Maybe should have checked the dwell more often?
