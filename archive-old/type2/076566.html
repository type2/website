&gt;Part of the reason I like buses is that they are
&gt;straight forward,even the Type4 style engines,so why
&gt;VW would want to ruin a good thing I don't know.

If the engineers at VW were allowed to build the vehicles they wanted to,
we would still see the original T-I available in the US. Times change, less
maintenance is demanded by new buyers (starting 20 years ago) so that is
adverstised and greatly insures the later cars will go to the junk yard
pre-maturly. No one what's any 15 year old Chevy/Honda/Isuzu anyway.

&gt;Yes,they are getting up to the 30+year mark,but even
&gt;still,you should be able to expect some reliability.

JHC, 30 years life is not good enough????? Which other manufacturer's parts
last 30 years????? Mercedes/BMW/Audi/Porsche for sure, but ones that cost
less than a VW???????????

&gt;OK, VW cut costs when they had FI designed but why
&gt;should we pay the reckoning?

Our voters allowed (demanded) the regulations that required it. Better to
have a SUV that gets 20 miles per gallons &quot;cleanly&quot; than to have something
that gets 30 miles to the gallon but lets out more hydrocarbons into the
atmosphere.  

&gt;And new computerised FI sets are expensive but no-one
&gt;seems to be rushing to fill that niche specifically
&gt;for Bugs'n'Buses.

Have you seen the cost of a precision carburator today??? None that I know
of will outlast a Bosch FI system.

&gt;For practically ANY other brand of car you can get an
&gt;aftermarket system for less than an arm and a leg yet
&gt;no-one seems to be interested in either improving
&gt;VWAG's system

I guarantee you that to improve the stock systems would cost much more than
the stock parts. That's why you don't find that anyone has spent the time
to design a system for replacement. If it really did work as well or better
or last much longer, it would cost far more. Thank God you can still buy
original Bosch parts for 30 year old systems. You can't say that for many
markets. 

&gt;I have a 67 panel which I still don't know what I'm
&gt;going to power it with and the above facts aren't
&gt;making the decision any easier.

Make it easy and at the lowest possible cost for results. Make it stock.

&gt;If VW FI did work I'd be there with bells on!

Follow procedures and specs., then put on your bell belt.

&gt;But well,you know where I stand.
&gt;Yes,FI is the future of cars and we have to face that.
&gt;But unfortunately it's not a reliable or economic
&gt;possibility for me.

If you try to &quot;update/convert/modernfy a VW it will either not work as well
as stock or cost you more. The least amount necessary to have a VW safe and
reliable may be beyond your budget. You will have to hold out for &quot;luck&quot; to
do better. 

&gt;Anyone else got thoughts on the subject?

As you see, I did.

Any $10,000 used car with factory maintenance only and 7 to 10 years old at
100K miles is far more risk than a 30 year old T-II in spec. (determined by
inspection, with maintenance history showing proof why it still has most of
the original parts still function nominal) and stock, even if the
compression is out of spec and it's ready for it's second motor rebuild at
300K. If it's never seen dirty oil, polish the crank and put in stdXstd
bearings/cam/pistons/cyld's/heads/oil pump/ect. Drive on to continued use
with proper maintenance indefinately.
