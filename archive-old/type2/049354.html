Hello,

I came home from work last night to find another bus parked next to our
westy, and in my transporters spot. At first glance I love this bus, even if
it is in my spot. After all it made friends
with 'punkin' already.

Its a high top roof bus, all the bells and whistels. I happily parked 'ruby'
alongside it and took as many pics as I could. I have to say I felt a little
bit jelous....

see it here :

so whats your guess on year and style?
Its now on my list of buses I feel like I need to own,
maybe we can swaP? =)

Chris, Kell, and Tre'
74 westy 'punkin'
75 transporter 'ruby'
