Subject: To Sump Or Not To Sump

I wanted to thank all for comments and advice. It looks like most believe 
it's not a good idea to use the sump. Few if any agree that it adds any 
cooling benefits. Most agree it's nice to have the extra oil capacity, but 
the down side is hitting it on something and taking the bottom of your 
engine case away.

I'll hold off for now.

Thanks again!
