&gt; Now for the question. While I was at my favorite boneyard on the eastern
&gt; shore I picked up a lock tumbler for my sliding door. I called a local

which yard are you talking about??

&gt; locksmith and he says he can re-key it for 35-40 bucks. He has not seen
&gt; this part yet and I wonder if he really can do this job. Anyone have
&gt; experience having locks rekeyed and if so whatdid you pay? I want my one
&gt; ket to fit all of my doors. The slider was missing its lock tumber when I
&gt; got the bus.

I rekeyed my locks to match my ignition several years back, it is not that
hard and the instructions are in the library.  It's not that hard and it
gives you a chance to clean the tumblers and to lose some of the small
springs ;8*}
