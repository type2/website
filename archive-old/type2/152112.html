&gt; Got a '78 Westy with a 2000 cc that the PO had

&gt; after it has been sitting for a week or so, it raps
&gt; for maybe 5 seconds a little bit, then once oil
&gt; pressure comes up, nice and smooth.

that sounds about normal for a 2000 since it has (stock) hyd lifters and
if the bus sits they can bleed down and need to pump up

&gt; Headed along a highway today with oil temp at say 80
&gt; to 90 degrees C, maybe 50 mph, and listening to the

sounds about right, actually it is a might cool.

&gt; radio.  I turn the radio off b/c something just
&gt; doesn't sound right out back.  The old lady says &quot;I
&gt; liked that song!&quot; and I says, I've got more important
&gt; things to worry about...  As suspected - godforsaken
&gt; racket coming from the engine.  I mean, the SOB is
&gt; RAPPING!  Like someone taking a hammer to the valve
&gt; covers.  Raps at idle and at all range of RPM.  Got 10
&gt; psi oil pressure or so at idle, 25 or so when above
&gt; idle.  No loss of power, seemed like all cyl were
&gt; firing.

not sure about that could be a few different things,  BTW who did the
rebuild on this engine...?

&gt; Any thoughts?  I am concerned about the sudden onset.
&gt; And I'm supposed to be getting this thing ready for my
&gt; honeymoon cruise around Maine the week after next!

suspectt you should start searching for alternate wheels.  enjoy your
wedding, where in Maine, I used to live in Auburn/Lewiston

also a 78 bus
