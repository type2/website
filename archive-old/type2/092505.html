Subject: VW shop closing

--=====================_11365682==_.ALT

hey folks, I just came from a local shop here in Tallahassee that is 
closing and after the next week or 2, they said everything that isn't sold 
is going to the crusher.  I saw 3 type IV engines with all tin and shrouds 
and alternators.  None of them have carbs or FI on them.  One has a single 
center mounted intake manifold (possibly weber).  They told me I could get 
all 3 engines for $100 (or a nominal amount.)  There's also a 72 Westy body 
there with jalousie windows and a 78 bus body there with sliding side 
windows and rear seat and middle seat.  Philosophically speaking, I'd hate 
to see all this stuff go to the crusher since they're not making this stuff 
anymore.  Would it be worth my while to go try salvage some of this 
stuff?  Thanks, Greg
