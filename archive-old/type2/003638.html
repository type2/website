&gt;I think the earlier systems were a lot more complicated - in electronic
&gt;design.  I think they simplified a lot of stuff on the 78-79, which
&gt;supposedly means better reliability because there is less to go wrong. . .


There is essentially no difference in complexity or parts count with all
L-Jet systems from '76 to '83, all are basically the same.  The presence of
throttle body switches came and went then came and went again, the second
air temp sensor came into the AFM but that was one you don't see (4 or 6
wire I guess.)  Very late an O2 sensor came if you were in CA which also
made the resistor pack go but introduced a little relay pack.  All parts are
vaguely interchangeable all years depending on how innovative one is.  Parts
count and complexity in the ECU changes year to year but is always about the
same.  Cool thing would be to get a new L-Jet system Bosch sells today to
work where the entire ECU and electronics are all mounted inside the AFM
lid, with the right harness to plug to all the parts that would be a WAY
cool retrofit, I wonder if some of the European folks might know what it
gets used on.  The L-Jet 914 (1800?) is similar.  Now T4's (411/412) came
with what I guess came to be D-Jet and it is more complex in my view as it
has throttle position sensor (I think, I know T3's did), has the points for
the FI in the distributor, etc.  This was T4's and I guess 1.7 and 2.0
914's, or I might have the 914 stuff backwards.  I've never personally seen
a '75 fuel injected 1800 bus but I've noticed the parts (injectors and cold
start) listed for them are often different and T3ish, which leads me to
think but have no idea that they may have been D-Jet as well.  For true
simplicity, all hail K-Jetronic on the early A1 cars, all mechanical
basically.
