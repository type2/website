zfactory/stock heater.  I followed VanNess's article on cleaning, testing,
&gt;and fabricating new diaphragms.  I got things in relative order and started
&gt;the flow rate test with the graduated cylinder, through the jet.  After
&gt;approx 1or 2 minutes the clicking stopped and now I only get a steady
&gt;stream.   I emailed Mr. Van Ness saturday but am waiting til monday to give
&gt;up on a response from him. 

My apologies to Oly and anyone else who attempts to contact me over a
weekend and receives no response.  Lately my email access has been limited
to weekdays, so if any mail is sent from late on friday to sunday, you'll be
hearing back from me on monday. :)  

Oly, my first thought regarding your problem is that perhaps the brass
fastener you used to fab the diaphragm is too thick.  As I mention in my
repair article, if the face that contacts the needle valve has not been
ground and stoned down to the same thickness as the original rivet, it will
depress the valve and cause fuel calibration problems (i.e. too much fuel if
too thick).

If you really have no clicking when the solenoid has 12v, then you will need
to replace the winding.  If you can't locate a used BN4 for parts, try
contacting Jurgen Ploetner at tessandjurg_at_hypertech.yk_dot_ca , he might have a
new winding for sale.

I have some updates and one correction to the BN4 articles on the web, but
as Ken has previously mentioned, FTP problems to Type2 have temporarily
stalled the wheels of progress.  Among other items I have a listing of BN4
part numbers for 6v-12v models and some parts sources, as well as some new
write-ups and photos.  Also, I am grateful to Nathan Badgley for alerting me
to an error in my write-up regarding the temperature regulating switch on
the duct that I have corrected but have not yet been able to upload.  The
bottom line is that the temperature regulating switch must be
installed--bypassing it will work for a test only, but not for long term
operation.  Many thanks to Nathan for pointing out this inexcuseable error
on my part.

&gt;length.  Arkady seems to have done a lot of work and research into these
&gt;heaters and while his arguments sound valid, I cannot afford the $300+ it
&gt;would cost to have him rehab the thing for me or sell me the metering fuel
&gt;pump he says is the ONLY safe way to use the old model BN4.  

The diagphragm pump and the pressure regulator on the early model are
especially unsafe in their old age due to potential fuel leakage points.  In
my articles I prefer to caution people to the specific hazards that lie in
wait (such as dried out fuel hose and diaphragm) and relate how to repair
and maintain aging parts as I do on my own early BN4 that I use in my daily
driver '71 Westy.  The choices are to spend $$$ or learn and repair--decide
what's best for yourself.
