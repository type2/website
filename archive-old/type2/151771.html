Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Loss

Eric,

Do a compression test followed by a leak down test.

Both will show the condition of your rings and valve guides...although 
severely worn valve guides(exhaust) will generally show as a lot of oil 
smoke.

Absolutely not leaking anywhere?  No oil slicks on the back ofthe bus?
No big drips after parking for several hours?

1 quart per 42 quarts of gas(10.x gallons) is about a 40:1 ratio...got any 
two stroke stuff at home that takes a 40:1 mizture?...it actually burns 
pretty clean looking once it warms up...

Look at your spark plugs closely and match the pics all over the net for 
what plugs look like when burning excessive oil....

Then there is only one place for it to really get out of the engine....
Valve stems or rings.....or being sucked into the carb thru the crankcase 
breather and into the combustion chamber.

Richard has an excellent write up on leakdown tests someplace....and how 
to make one cheaply if you have a compressor.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Recently I have noticed that I have been going through a lot of oil. It seems
&gt; that I am loosing it at about a rate of 1 quart per tank of gas. I can not
&gt; find any evidence that it is leaking out ( a couple of spots about the size of
&gt; a quarter when I park ) I would guess that I am burning it - my question is
&gt; would I burn it at this rate and not see much evidence at the the tail pipe -
&gt; because it doesn't seem to be smoking - my wife followed me on a trip recently
&gt; for about 4hrs and she said that I was not producing anything noticable
&gt; Any thoughts ?
