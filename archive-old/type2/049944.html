Subject: Re: [T2] Rear brakes/ heads/ timing light?

&gt;      My rear brakes, seems to be backing off. A month ago I adjusted my
&gt; rear brakes, and my parking brake, after adjusting my brake pedal was
&gt; nice and hard, now my parking brake comes way out again, and I have a
&gt; hard time stopping, this is how it was before adjusting them, I can tell
&gt; my front brakes are doing all the stopping. so whats up with these
&gt; brakes? I replaced the shoes about a year and a half ago, I also flushed
&gt; and bleed the brake fluid. I'm going to adjust the brakes again
&gt; hopefully this weekend.

Yep, the brakes are not self-adjusting.  You have to adjust them every so
often.  How often depends on how much you drive your Bus.  The more quickly
you wear down the brake shoes, the more often you will have to adjust them.

When you adjust the rear brakes the parking brake adjustment will be back to
normal.
