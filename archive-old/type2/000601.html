To all:  here's my 2 cents worth on learning anything mechanical, including
driving a stick shift...

For myself, and a whole lot of other people in my estimate, one learns how
to run something (a bus, a bicycle, a PC, nuclear submarines...) if you have
even a reasonable idea of what is really happening when you push that pedal
in.  I'll bet that if Lloyd slides under the bus with his son and they look
at the clutch lever on the side of the housing together, and then check out
the accelerator cable as it enters the engine compartment, and look at a
little diagram of a clutch assembly first, all the rest will go so much
better.  This latter 20th century notion of things being so automatic so
your pretty little head doesn't get confused with all it has to do is
corrosive, applied idiocy.  Noone can know everything (that's why most of us
are on the list, eh?), but when his brain understands the process, those
feet and hands will get the idea all that much faster.

And I'll bet Lloyd's son will be telling his friends about the bus he took
his license test in the rest of his life.  I haven't told anybody about mine
(French Simca) in twenty years, at least.  Good for you, dad.
