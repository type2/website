Subject: Re: Sales Taxes, was: CB Performance problem

I passed along some _incorrect_ information in my previous post.  Jim
at Old Volks Home (who obviously is in a much better position to know
such things) was nice enough to point this out to me in pmail so I
could correct things.

This is incorrect.  In Cal. you pay whatever tax is due at the
_business'_ address.  The only time that the businessman has to charge
a different tax is if he is physically selling in a location different
from his business address, such as at a swap.

What happens in other states is anyone's guess.

Sorry for misconscrewing the facts!
