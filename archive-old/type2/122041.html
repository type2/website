Subject: Heater blower fan electricals

Folks...

I replaced my dead (stuck) heater blower fan in my '76 Westy this 
weekend with one from a junk yard Bus.  The new one blows quite a bit 
of air (too bad it loses all of its &quot;umph&quot; by the time it gets past the 
heat exchangers).

I'm still having some minor trouble with the electrical circuit in the 
Bus, though.

First if all, I need to verify that the fuse in the power supply line 
coming from the battery should be 16A (an 8A one popped pretty 
quickly).  I'm guessing it is, but I don't have an owner's manual to 
verify it with, so a sanity check would be appreciated.

Secondly, the blue wire that provides the trigger voltage for the relay 
is duff somewhere.  When the key is on, I only get ~1.7V on that wire, 
and it is barely able to illuminate my test light; I guess maybe it has 
corroded or broken somewhere, and that there is significant resistance 
as a result.  Instead of trying to find the fault in the blue wire, I 
was thinking that I would just tap that from the + side of the coil, 
instead (why VW didn't do this for all low-current switched circuits 
back there is beyond me).  I tested this with a jumper wire, and it 
seems to work just fine.  Can anyone see any problems with this 
solution?  Can anyone tell me where exactly that blue wire runs on its 
way up to the front?  (The wiring diagram seems to indicate that it 
ties in at the alternator warning light?)

As always, your help is greatly appreciated :-)
