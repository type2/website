Subject: Re: Propex: Starting the Installation

Excellent info Tom.  I'm sure it will help all of us.

I decided to get an RV place to install mine for me.  I have an appointment for next 
Wednesday.  I'm sure that Caron wouldn't set foot in a bus that I installed any propane 
devices myself (and I propbably wouldn't feel very comfortable either).

So hopefully everyone will post any troubles/suggestions they come up with while 
installing.  I'm going to print them all out and bring them with me to the RV service 
place next Wednesday.

I'm halfway through staining the wooden box I built for our new porta-potti.  Should be 
ready about the same time as the heater is installed.  Then it's off to Whistler for 
some snowboarding ;-)
