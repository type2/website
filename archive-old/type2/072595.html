Subject: cv joint grease
Message-Id: &lt;v01510102b34e3ebd2cd4_at_[207.172.65.2]&gt;

For my '71 Westy, I have the drive shafts off and plan to clean and repack
the cv joints.

One tube of the CV joint grease sold by, among others, RMMW is said to fill
one joint and so it does if all one does is pack it into the joint itself.
On the other hand, a mechanic at a VW dealer once told me  that the reason
why my boots cracked that time was that &quot;the rubber dried up because I
failed to push grease all the way in to fill the boot&quot;.

Fast forward a decade to early this year.  I did this on new boots that I
installed a thousand miles ago but three of the four are already cracked,
a problem that many on this list have experienced.

Anyone have wisdom to pass on for repacking?  Only the joint or all the way
into the boot?

Secondly,  on two of the four joints, the grease literally gushed out as I
seperated it from the transaxle and wheel.  It had the consistency of gear
oil, not of grease.  It's viscosity had somehow gone way down in the
thousand miles. Can anyone comment on this?

Thanks, Jack
