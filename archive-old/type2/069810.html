Subject: Brake servo replacement

My '71 Westy was having severe braking problems recenty (brake pedal decended
to the floor as soon as I started my engine).  I did a quick study on the
brake servo.  As a test, I went to the junk yard Saturday and pulled a couple
of servos out of some '73 buses.  I bought the one that had the best suction
then went home to install.  Once I pulled my servo out it became very
apparent that was my problem.  The one from the Westy was RUSTED mush with
absolutley no suction.  I had replaced my check valve earlier to try to get
off cheap but that didn't work.  My brakes work great now and the entire job
probably took 3 hours including bleeding the lines.
