Subject: Brake lights don't work, neither do turn signals ('69 bus)

Hey folks,
Excuse me for my lack of electrical intelligence (and appropriate wiring 
diagram)
Here's the problem:  For a month or so, my brake lights seemed to take 
progressively more pressure to come on, until one day they finally quit.  
Brake light switch, methinks.  So I have a couple questions regarding this.
There is a dual-circuit master cylinder, i.e. 2 switches, with the prongs 
arranged in this fashion ( I _ I ).  The vertical one on the right is 
positive.  What are the other two? 
Suppose I want to bypass the hydraulically activated switch, as a quick fix 
until I have time to bleed the brakes...and I use a momentary on switch, 
which leads must be connected in order for the brake lights to glow?  
Problem #2:  On my way to radio shack to buy said switch, my turn signals all 
of a sudden quit working.  (The brake lights have been gone for some time).  
I cleaned the contacts on the switch to no avail.  I had been using my 
emergency blinkers as half-assed brake lights, to at least give people behind 
me some warning.  Could a combination of the blinkers and turn signals bunged 
up the relay??  I thoroughly cleaned the grounds by the tail lights but that 
didn't affect anything.  
Any help is greatly appreciated.
