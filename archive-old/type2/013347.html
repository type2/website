&gt; I have a 1600 Dual Port.  It ran fine but the carb was old so I wanted

&gt; little.
&gt;
&gt; Then the oil light came on at idle only. This was about 2-3 weeks after 
&gt; the carb was replaced. So then I replaced the sensor and cleaned the  
&gt; relief valve??(the screw at the bottom of the case).  The oil light 
&gt; still goes on at idle ONLY.  Never while driving.  I took it to always 
&gt; vw and did an oil pressure test and it has zero reading at idle.
&gt;
&gt; The engine was rebuilt about 30,000 miles ago.  The valves were recut.  
&gt; At the time I didnít know too much about the inside of an engine(and 
&gt; still donít).  So I donít remember what else was done on the engine but 
&gt; I would assume they pulled it all apart and inspected everything.  What

&gt;
&gt; Does this sound normal?  The compression check was over 110 all the way

&gt;
&gt; Any advice?

I've had the same problem for the last two months and have been pulling 
my hair out trying
to identify just what's going on.   I had also replaced my carb and 
that's where the
problems started, but I don't think they were necessarily carb related 
(I could be wrong).

Here are some of the things I came up with:

1)  It turns out that the first two NEW carbs I had were pieces of junk 
and had bushings which
  	leaked.  This very subtle leak made it impossible to properly tune 
my carb, and the idle
	was inconsistent.  Basically, it had all the symptoms of a vacuum leak.

2) Related to #1, my idle was not consistent after setting it.  I would 
set it around 900 RPM,
	drive it around, and confirm that it was at 900 RPM, but the next 
time i drove it,
	the idle would be off.  If I had adjusted the idle up, the idle 
would be ~1100-1200 RPM,
	if I had adjusted it down, it would be ~700-800 RPM -- not enough 
to keep the
	oil pressure up.  I think this is carb related, but i'm not sure.

So, I would say that when you're having the red light come on at hot 
idle, pull over and
check where the engine is idling at.  Is it under 850 RPM?  That could 
be the source of
the light coming on.  If it's idling fine at 850-&gt;950 RPM, then I'm not 
sure where the
problem is:  most likely it's an oil pump.

AFAICT, the oil pump can only be tested by someone with the proper 
equipment (and with
the engine out of the car?)....

I'll be trying out a new carb in the next few days and will probably be 
able to let you know
if my problem was carb-related or not...

cheers and good luck,
