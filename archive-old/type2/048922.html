Subject: [T2] Carb Problems

Hello all,

Well once again I come to you all for some advice.  I have a 1970 bus, with 
a single 34PICT2 carb. I have put a rebuild kit on it, and it now idles, 
but does not want to accelerate cold or warm.  The eletric choke does not 
work but I am not all that worried about that cause that is easy.  I have 
adjusted the card as per the Bentley book, and still have the same problem.

Help please I would love to drive my little bus.


Mike
