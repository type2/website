I have a 4.12x.82x1.26 4th in my bus, and 215-75-15 tires on my '66 bus.
I'm very comfortable cruising at 60-65, and 70-75 is no problem to
achieve... just gets a bit noisy.  I have a pretty basic 1600SP.

FYI: 4.37x.82x1.26 = 4.51 final is standard for my bus
     4.12x.89x1.26 = 4.62 is what Douglas is running (same as my old tranny)
and  4.12x.82x1.26 = 4.25 final

The 4.12 R&amp;P and .89 4th is supposed to be from a bug.
