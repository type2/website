Dropped into the marine supply store today and the guy just looked at me 
like I was an idiot, (astute fellow isn't he?) :-) and then deadpanned 
the comment &quot; 3 inch or 4 inch&quot;? I looked at him intently for about 3 
seconds, before I retreated outside to fade into the sunset.
Regards,
Courtney
