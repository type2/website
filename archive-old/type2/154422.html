Subject: Re: [T2] starter terminal confusion

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;richard carlton&quot;

&gt; i need to know which of the spade terminals are which in my starter.   i
&gt; have looked at the wiring diagram over and over but my question is&quot;  does
&gt; the Skinny red and white wire to the double relay belong on number 50 or
&gt; 30?  now i need to know which spade is which?  any pics of how things 
&gt; should
&gt; look?


Terminal 30 is a threaded stud...

Terminal 50 is a spade push on

The skinny red/white wire to the double relay goes to terminal 50 on the 
starter ,,, to give power to the double relay when the key is in the start 
position.

hope that helps
