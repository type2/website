Subject: Re: [T2] Phenolic blocks for intake gaskets?

&gt;I just called Painter's Grinding and they have both the normal

At least as far as stock is concerned:

The phenolic spacer goes between the carb and the manifold and it's sandwiched by two very thin paper gaskets:

The gasket between the manifold and the head was paper but it's now metal in the gasket sets.

There seems to be less of these items shown in the fiche:
