&gt;The clutch seems okay, but worn.

Have you adjusted the cable to Bentley spec.?

&gt;I'm hoping that a run at 35 mph might clean up the cylinders a bit.

Give it an hour on the freeway.  Low, cool speeds won't do much.

&gt;He also needs new air cleaner, and an oil change would probably not hurt.

Do these before any further road testing.

&gt;Using the stick is a little weird after the tight movement of the S's stick.
&gt;Is the stick supposed to lay up against the side of your right leg?  Or is
&gt;my bus just letting me know that he's fond of his new owner?

When was the last time you replace the shift rod bushings?  And no, you
do not need to cast some.  They are readily, and cheaply available.  8o)

&gt;Needs shocks, or I'm just not use to the ride, yet.

Probably needs shocks.  Oil filled OEMs are the be$t, but Gas-A-Justs on
the rear, and Gas Riders on the front will suffice, for quite a bit le$$.

&gt;The steering is a bit loose, I don't like the few degrees of play.

Tie rod ends.  When's the last time you replaced 'em?  Maybe the
steering box, but let's just hope it's the tie rod ends.

&gt;Everything electrical seems to work, including the high beam switch, but the
&gt;turn signal function is shot.  I'm hoping that I can rebuild it.

The switch is not working, or is it the flasher relay/fuse/bulbs/wiring?

&gt;Tomorrow, we try a 3 mile round trip to the store...

Replace the oil first.  If you don't have any, get some at the store while 
you're there.
Old dirty, nasty, water contaminated oil is just *not* what you want 
lubricating your
bearings.
