&gt;When I pump my brake pedal the first time I stop the way I have
&gt;come to expect my bus to stop. If you pump the pedal a couple of times you
&gt;have better pressure and &quot;more stop&quot;.  What up?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
Adjust your rear brakes. You are doing your stopping on the fronts only 
until you pump them up. Turn each star wheel til the wheel locks then back 
off 3 clicks.
The reason the pedal comes up as you pump is you are overcoming the springs 
pulling the shoes back with brake fluid pressure. If you wait longer, then 
the spring pressure will overcome the fluid pressure and the pedal will be 
lower when you press on it. [which is what is happening now]

Since you have an auto trans you probably don't use the parking brake. The 
parking brake is a dead giveaway your rear shoes need adjusting. The handle 
will just pull out all the way and not hold. When this happens, never adjust 
the parking brake cables. Adjust the rear shoes.

I have the 'Warranty &amp; Maintenance' booklet that came with my 77. It says to 
change the oil every 7500 miles AND check the brake adjustment. [on another 
page it says &quot;Have the engine oil changed after 6 months if you drive less 
than 7500 during this 6 month period&quot;. after that it says &quot;If you use your 
car under severe driving conditions, it may be necessary to change the oil 
more frequently&quot;.] I change my oil every 3000 miles AND adjust my rear shoes 
then.
