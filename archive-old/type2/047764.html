Subject: [T2] Help in Indiana?

List,
My mechanic asked me fwd this to the list.  Not sure what kind if bus the kid
has. Assuming by the message he has blown one of the oil plugs out of a type4
air cooled engine in a 70's bus and will need help tapping the hole and
installing a plug.  Send advice to keslingb_at_walbash_dot_edu or to
gentery_at_webtv_dot_net  Jay, you close to Crawfordsville?

Thanks for any help.

hi clark
being im not on the type2 list im turning to you
to see if you can get someone on the list in
the crawfordsville ind. area, ben is in school
there and has a small problem whitch is over
his head. [unless he's looking down at it ]
he called here for help and i felt you were the
best to get him help.
he dumped all this rather suddenly, and found
a oil galley plug on top of the fan schroud.
there are about 5 plugs in the oil filter area.
he needs help to fix the leak by removing
the schroud and tapping the hole for the
proper pipe plug. he has never ventured
into this sort of repairs, smart but green.

Contact info for needy type2 owner:

ben kesling
515 west walbash
crawfordsville ind.

keslingb_at_walbash_dot_edu

i do not have a phone #
if you could throw this out on the net where
it would do him the most good i would appreciate it greatly.
thanks
gentery
