Subject: what is this Engine Code?

OK 

I finally had a chance to dig around and look for my engine code.
This is what i cam up with, it was right above the engine tin, and right
below the push rod tubes on the passenger side.

I believe the engine to be a 914 engine.

The number i found is 004101102A

I can't seem to find what it means.

thanks again

eli
