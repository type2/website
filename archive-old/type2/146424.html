Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield Washer Pump?

Richard,

 

As always you've got good info - thanks!  

 

A follow-up question though... I have a '79 bus - what are the colors for
the wires that I should be looking for to hookup a windshield wash pump?

 

Regards,

 

Wayne

&gt;I did have it a little easier than I could have -- some months ago I 

&gt;kludged a Rabbit wiper/turnsignal switch set into the steering column 

&gt;of my Bus and that was already designed for an electric washer pump.

 

The most recent SWF switches for our busses (at least the 74-79 ones) have
the contact as well.
