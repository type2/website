Subject: lorax strikes again...

I did a compression test of my own Monday, I found some not too great
news. I forget exactly what the measurements were something like 90 in 1
40 in 2, 30 in 3 and 60 in 4. So i retracted my request for vacation to 
go to High Country. A friend and i are going to pull it apart this
weekend or next, to re-ring it. I found an air leak from an elbow hose
that was conveinantly nestled so no one could find it till now. and Now
i've been driving around with it for a YEAR bruning the hell out of me
new engine. I apologize for my beat attitude but I was so looking
forward to HCBF and most of all VACATION W/ MY BUS.
things will be great I can feel it.
see ya at the next one.
