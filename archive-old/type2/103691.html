&gt;     I've just come from the archives but would like to hear more
&gt; opinions and ideas.  I need to replace the vacuum hoses for the brake
&gt; booster on our '71 bus.  The closest thing I can find locally is 1/2
&gt; inch heater hose.  It is thick walled and seems to have a fabric
&gt; reinforcement embedded in the middle of the rubber.
&gt;     Does anyone have a source for the proper hose?  If not, what have
&gt; some of you used?

You don't want to use heater hose.  Gas fumes will attack the rubber and
the vacuum might collapse it.

There is a inch-sized vacuum hose available that is within thousandths of
the metric original.  I don't have my bus handy, but good vacuum hose is
definitely out there and not uncommon  Check your FLAPS.
