You were not mistanken.  a seal DOES go there.  It is deisgned to limit
the amount of water coming into the roof.  (which then drains out of the
pan, through the 4 drain tubes..)

It may/maynot be available as such.  If not, a bug/rabbit/early volvo (All
the early Golde model units use a similar seal...) should fit, but you'll
need more then one. 2, maybe more.  clean the edge of the panel (remove it
first..) and install the seal with some 3m weatherstrip adhesive.  There
should be a section in the Bentley that covers this.

good luck finding those parts..

later...david
