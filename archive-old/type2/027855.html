Subject: 1980 speedo cable disconnect???

While underneath my project van (1980 Westy) last weekend I saw what looked 
like the speedo cable disconnected in the spare tire area (screw on type 
jack at end of cable here). Is the speedo cable a two piece item? that is, 
does it go from the dashboard (1st piece) then swing through the 
undercarriage (2cd piece) to a wheel with a connection piont in between???

There was also a vacume line (flexible rubber about 1/4 inch) laying there 
with no obvious connection point to anything above the spare tire area. I 
traced back to the engine compartment where it also was not connected to 
anything. This vehicle once had Dealer A/C installed on it. Could it have 
something to do with that?
