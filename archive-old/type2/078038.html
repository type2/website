Subject: Re: [T2] 78 2.0L

Do all that the good doktor has mentioned, except one thing.

Take the Bentley to your outhouse, and use it for toilet paper.

This worthless mass of bound paper, is only good for telling you just
enough to get you into trouble, and leaves you on your own anyway.

OK for spec's, not for good, specific, lead you to the problem, trouble
shooting.

Sounds like your running short on fuel.

Pull the fuel line off at the engine side of the pump, and put the hose
into a coffee can.
Have someone turn on the ignition, and you will find out real quick if
you have a fuel from the pump / filter problem.

 
E-mail message From Doktor=A0Tim 

Okay, 
Here's the situation. I just bought a 78 Van 
=A0=A0=A0=A0It ran for about 10 seconds, shut down and then 
would not fire again. When I cranked it, it would almost catch, but not
quite. 
=A0=A0I do have spark, and I
would assume fuel.....Hmmm! 
Thanks, 
Sam 
You can't assume anything, you must verify. Mechanicals first (valve
adjust/compression/leakdown). Check intake air duct and all vaccuum and
other hoses hooked into the intake and stop any leaks. Then verify that
spark at the plugs is HOT. If not sort out the ignition. Then address
the fuel system. Pull the fuel filter. Pour the fuel out the inlet end.
Blow through the filter. There should be very little resistance once you
get the gas blown out. Renew or replace it. Then verify fuel pressure.
Note that if the fuel pump is making any noises other than a very smooth
hum, it's been stressed and could be a problem very soon even if it is
still putting out spec pressure and volume. 
Once all that is verified and you still have a problem, only then begin
testing the vaious components that feed info to the FI computer, the
ECM. 
There are quite a number of things that can cause your symptom. Follow
Bentley in order. Note that engine comes first, then ignition, then fuel
system. It comes in that order for the very specific reason that you
will not miss the culprit/s if you skip no steps. Any step skipped might
in fact miss the malfactor and lead to much further work (time/money)
and poor/no results.
