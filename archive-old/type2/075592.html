&gt; Shame on you&lt;grin&gt;....you of all should know better than to say 
&gt; &quot;test&quot; or
&gt; &quot;reference&quot; without the URL or personal data.
&gt; 
&gt; Where is the data for synthetics???
&gt; I *know* that you know your stuff, but share!
&gt; 
&gt; I use mobil 1 in F**d, but am afraid to use it in my bugs.  Every 
&gt; time
&gt; that I do, it seems to get sucked up faster than 1 qt/3,000 miles.
&gt; 
&gt; In my F**d I use 0 quarts/10,000 miles.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, dave
&gt;

&gt; &gt; The synthetic oil &quot;truth&quot; is based on testing when? 197x? I assure 
&gt; you, oils
&gt; &gt; have made huge changes since then. OUR testing has shown 10-15 
&gt; degree drops
&gt; &gt; in oil temps, with other engine temps staying the same or 
&gt; dropping, PROVIDED
&gt; &gt; you use one of a couple brands of oil.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The benefits of synthetics are not utilized if you don't have 
&gt; good
&gt; &gt; filtration, since to remove the dirt you have to change the oil 
&gt; ($$$$).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I really wish people would take a good HARD look at tests, and 
&gt; when they
&gt; &gt; were done, when repeating that &quot;information&quot; to everyone within 
&gt; earshot.
&gt; &gt; Otherwise we'll all be driving with Bias Ply tires, straight 
&gt; weight oil, and
&gt; &gt; AM radios. Time marches on (and so does technology), don't get 
&gt; stuck in a
&gt; &gt; rut!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; PS: There is some EXTENSIVE dyno testing taking place on certain 
&gt; cylinder
&gt; &gt; head chamber shapes, and deck heights, and compression ratios, on 
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; upright Type 1 engine, including oil and head temps, and output 
&gt; #s, that
&gt; &gt; will try to rid the VW World of a humongous Myth that's been 
&gt; circulating for
&gt; &gt; what seems like forever. Stay tuned. My lips are sealed, but you 
&gt; heard it
&gt; &gt; here first.
