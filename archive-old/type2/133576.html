&gt; Do many of you out there have a 6-point metric box wrench set??  [[WRENCH,

&gt; I have only seen the 12-point wrench sets.

I have a few and I like em, but they were not in a set, bought one at a
time when I saw them.   I really like the (dern I can't remember the real
name) wrenches that are almost but not quite a box wrench, has enough
opening to get the bolt thru but not the nut.   sort of a 5/6 box wrench.
