&gt;The van dropped an intake valve seat on #1 cylinder when I was doing
&gt;compression testing in the driveway. Very lucky. The van/engine has only
&gt;51K miles on the original engine.

But it is 20 years old.

&gt;1. Is it common for the VW heads to drop seats this easily? 

Yes.

&gt;I was hoping
&gt;to just replace the one head as the compression is fine on the other.

You run the risk of the other head suffering the same fate.  Most rebuilt heads now have special procedures done to keep the seats in place.

&gt;2. Is it OK just to replace the one head?

Depends.  There are subtle variations in heads (like combustion chamber shape) that can have big consequenses.  If you just want it to run, you can do it.  If you want to drive to Alaska and back next summer, do both heads.

&gt;3. Any suggestions (sources) for a good cheap pair of ring clamps for
&gt;VW's?

Swap meet, NAPA auto parts.  Not a VW-specific tool.

&gt;4. I have never honed a cylinder. Is this necessary if I keep the
&gt;existing rings?

No.

&gt; Or should I just replace the rings.

Depends on compression/leakdown results.  If okay, there is no need to replace rings and hone cyliners just because you removed the piston for another reason.

&gt; Will a shop hone the
&gt;cylinders?

If the rings are replaced they will, otherwise probably not.

&gt; I was originally trying to not have to remove the cylinders,
&gt;but to clean the area, adjust the deck height, I will have to remove
&gt;them. Anything i should be careful of?

Don't break a ring.  :)

&gt; Where does one get new shims to
&gt;to adjust for machining of the cylinder heads? 

I got mine from Rocky Mountain Motorworks.

&gt;5. If I replace the rings, what happens if I do this on only one side?
&gt;Will this unbalance the engine?

I wouldn't recommend doing rings on only one side.  If you do them, do all four cylinders.  Otherwise leave them alone.

&gt;6. In the process of dropping the seat, the valve put a small ding in
&gt;the piston. Should I worry about this?

No, it will quickly fill in with carbon deposits.

&gt;7. I notice a lot of carbon deposits under the valve cover and past the
&gt;cylinder head seal. In addition the seal on # 1 cylinder was warped.
&gt;This indicates that the valves and cylinder were leaking. The worst
&gt;carbon deposits are on #2 cylinder. It's seal looked fine. What causes
&gt;this and how do I avoid the problem when I rebuild the engine?

VW now says not to use the head gaskets.  You will have to make your own decision on this one (I still use them).  You can lap the cylinders where they seat against the head to improve the seal.

&gt;8. When I had adjusted the valves (about 300 miles before problem) the
&gt;lifters appeared soft. Looking at the lifters they look almost
&gt;brand-new? They have been in the car for 20 years. Should I 1) bother
&gt;trying to rebuild the lifters (clean them) and then purge the air, 2)
&gt;just purge the air, or 3) buy new ones?

Do you have more time than money, or vice-versa?  

&gt;9. The neighborhood we live in gives us problems if they see a car
&gt;disabled. They threatened to have the van towed when I was replacing the
&gt;gas tank. A tight budget means that I must do the work myself here. Thus
&gt;I have stripped the tin, exhaust, etc. with the engine in the car to
&gt;remove the problem cylinder. Other than making this task slightly more
&gt;difficult, is there any other reason why I can't complete the repair
&gt;with the engine in the car?

Can't answer this as I haven't done this job on a Vanagon.  I did it in my '73 camper though, once.  The next time I pulled the engine at night and worked on it in the tile entryway of my apartment.

&gt;10. Any reason why I can't replace the intake and exhaust studs with
&gt;stainless to avoid the problems with rust I had when removing them? Will
&gt;the aluminum heads corrode faster? Where could I get stainless studs?

Dunno about this one - I'm not sure the thermal expansion properties of stainless are compatable with the aluminum head.  In my experience the stud isn't the problem, the nut is.  You can get brass nuts and/or stainless nuts, and combined with anti-seize you should be okay.


&gt;11. The cylinder head studs and heads were rusty. Should these or all
&gt;the studs be replaced?

Depends on the rust.  Light surface rust is normal.  You said heads but I think you meant cylinders as the heads are aluminum and don't rust (they do oxidize a bit though).

&gt; In the future what is the best way to lock the
&gt;studs into the case so that they do not come out when I am trying to
&gt;just take of the head?

Loctite.
