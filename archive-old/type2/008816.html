I saved this because I have a 70 and it is good info. I hope Mark does
not mind me passing this on, it may answer the questions surounding the
69-70 masters.

&gt; A little info to save someone the aggravation I had ordering a master
&gt; cylinder for the Turtle.  As with many instances in parts
&gt; replacement,
&gt; changes in design don't always happen as the model year changes.  I
&gt; ordered
&gt; a MC from Bus Depot off the web, this one is a 1970 only part.  When
&gt; I
&gt; received it and compared to the old one, I had only one outlet in the
&gt; new MC
&gt; for a stop light switch instead of two in the original.  With the
&gt; help of
&gt; the Bus Depot folks we determined that my 1970, built 8/69, took the
&gt; 68-69
&gt; MC.  Unfortunately that meant the price went from $50 to $110.  Hope
&gt; this
&gt; helps someone out someday.
