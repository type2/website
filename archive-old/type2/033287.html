Subject: Early Bay/X-Mas Lights/48th Street in Tempe

'Mornin All,
     I'm in Phoenix this week on business, yesterday about 5:15 I passed an 
early Bay, red/white, with Christmas lights on the front going down 48th 
street in Tempe. Anyone on the list? BTW, this may fly in Phoenix, but in 
Virginia if you do this ( Christmas lights on your car) and you run into a 
cop with an attitude, you WILL get a ticket, speaking from experience. I say 
one with an attitude because I did this years ago, drove around for weeks 
with no problem, til one night I got pulled over by a real a**hole of a cop. 
I had done nothing wrong, but got a ticket for the lights. Whats happened to 
all the Westys in Phoenix? I come here quite a bit, but this is my first trip 
in 2 years. Usually see Westys all over the place, have seen maybe one or two 
so far. Plenty of air-cooled bugs around, a few Ghias, but hardly any buses 
or Westys. Went by LeSueur Car Co. on Sunday, &quot;Arizona's Largest Unauthorized 
VW Dealer&quot; their ad says, but they were closed. Saw some Westys way in the 
back of the lot, but the 10' fence and Fido walking the lot prevented me from 
getting any closer.      Jeff S.
