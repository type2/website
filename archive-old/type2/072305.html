Whilst driving to the airport Monday, my 1972 type-2 (with A/C... yeehaw)
developed a weird accelerator problem. I have not researched it fully yet, as 
I had to get my other type-2 and drive to the airport right away. 

Here's the deal:

Out of the blue, my accel pedal stuck down 1/2 way. I hit the clutch and 
the engine raced. I shut off the ignition and started looking....

The pedal is 1/2 down. I can raise it back up and it stays there, but if I 
press on it, it stays down. 

The accel cable in the back is LOOSE, not tight. But it does not move freely 
in the tube. The throttle valve was normal. 

When I start it up, the engine races. I cannot get it back off (with only one 
person, it was tricky racing the engine and running back to look at the 
linkages, etc.....)

Any idea? Accel cable &quot;frayed&quot; and sticking? Wide open? I thought that would 
fail a completely different way.....

Just looking for ideas, prior to taking the pan off when I get back home....

Gracias en frente, 
chuck
