Well, I've watched this thread for a week, I guess I'll jump on board! 
I don't disagree with most of what you're saying and I think that by
free revving to 34-3600 rpm, you'll still have ported vacuum to run the
vacuum advance (shown as 7.9 inches mercury  on late 76-78 all 2 liters
and 9.4 inches mercury on 79 Cal 2 liters). The reason for this is that
at no load the butterfly is not open very far and there's still a lot of
vacuum.
What I would take issue with, however, is whether under full load, the
vacuum advance is even functional because under full load the throttle
butterfly is fully open and the vacuum in the whole intake tract is
pretty low. I don't know how low, but I'd bet it's less that 8 inches.
Anyone with a functional vacuum guage care to enlighten me?
This would indicate that a stock engine under full load has  more like
32 degrees lead, not 44.
All the numbers may add up to 44 (43, actually on the fed, 46 on the 79
Cal) but under these circumstances, cylinder filling is pretty low and
chances of knock are pretty remote.
I actually have very little idea of where my timing is set on most of my
cars (except the diesel which is normally set with a dial). I use a
light to get it into the ballpark and then bump it back and forth till
it feels good. This works for me, but I do have the benefit of having
roasted a few pistons in busses to put it into perspective. (All those
cars had 7.8 or higher compression and ALL rattled enough to wake up the
dead- if I'd just realized what I was hearing!)
