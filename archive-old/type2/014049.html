Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Progressive carb on `77 BUS



&gt; I know lots'o folks on the list have had bad luck or just plain hate the
&gt; Weber Progressive setup.
&gt; 
&gt; Not me! I ran one on my '77 Westy for 4 years without a problem...

&gt; ...Cold weather may cause carb icing - there is no heat riser. This could be a
&gt; big issue. I only run my bus in the 'better' half of the year so it was not
&gt; an issue with me.

A piece of data for carb icing fanatics:

Carb icing does not require cold temperatures and in fact cannot occur at temperatures below freezing.  As air goes through a carburator 
it is sent through a venturi which increases the speed of the air and, courtesy of Daniel Bernoulli, lowers the pressure.  Lower pressure, 
according to another chap named Charles, means lower temperature.  Air goes into the carb at, say, 55F and is sped up in the venturi.  
The temperature of the air drops to 30F at which point any moisture in the air will condense out and freeze into ice.  If the ice starts to 
build up, you end up with the problem called carb icing.  

The idea that carb icing is most serious from 50F to 70F is drummed into the head of any student pilot, since airplanes have manual 
carburator heat controls.  Part of the landing checklist is to turn on the carb heat as you approach the runway so that the carb won't ice 
up during the descent and then not respond with power if the pilot decides to go around.

On my '71 (with dubious heat riser condition), use the hot air tube and wire the flap in the &quot;hot&quot; position during the mild SoCal winter.  This 
improves drivability and I haven't had any icing problems.  If I were running a higher compression engine I'd be very sensitive to 
detonation, as the hotter intake air could cause it.  On my MexiMotor this isn't a problem at all.

The cure for this is either to heat the part of the carb and intake manifold to melt the ice, or to heat the intake air so that icing conditions 
are never created.  VW uses both of these approaches on carbed engines, but on a single Weber conversion the heat riser isn't present.  I 
don't think that there is much icing problems with dual webers since the intake manifolds are short and heated directly by the heads.
