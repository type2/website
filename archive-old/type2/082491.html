Subject: 77-78 Westy

I recently purchased a '77 Westy that had the stove, sink, and fridge
removed (and they're WAY long gone). Are the 77 and 78 Westy
interiors the same or did they change slightly between the two years?
How about '79? I know someone who has an entire '79 (beds and all)
interior for sale and was contemplating buying it.

Hey there,

The westy interiors are the same for 76-79 (except for the plaid
colors). Remember that there are two versions of the interior, the
deluxe (stove, fridge) and the standard or weekender (no stove,
icebox).

You can pretty much put any bay interior into any other bay. It'll
fit, it just might not be correct for the year of the bus (i.e 74-75
interior in a 76-79).

The 79 will fit.

Hope this helps,
