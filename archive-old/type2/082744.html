&gt; &gt; This is per how the meter is supposed to be used. The van won't start

&gt; hmmm, mine has clips that go on the battery for power.  So both + &amp; - are
&gt; hooked to battery.  then a third wire is clipped to the battery, but I am
&gt; trying to remember, thought it was + side of coil but I read the
&gt; instructions every time I use it to remember
&gt;
&gt; what brand of dwell meter do you have?

Good point!  There are two different kinds of meter and it makes a
difference!  My analog has only two wires and hooks to ground and terminal
1 (?+?) on the coil but if you have three wires, then the black and red go
to + and - on the battery (or other 12V source) and the sensor wire goes
to terminal 1.

Jeff,

It is barely  possible that your coil/condensor are so marginal that the
power take-off from the meter make the difference between starting and
not starting, but it is very unlikely.  If the bus will start w/o the
meter hooked up, start it and attach the leads while it is running.  If
that kills it, then fersure you are hooking the leads up wrong somehow.
