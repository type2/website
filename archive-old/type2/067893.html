Subject: Re: Dumb Heat Question

        I was hit by that inspiration a while back too, but the impression
I've since gotten from various engine gurus is that the possible benefits
of toasty toes is far outweighed by the increased wear on the engine.  I'm
no pro and feel free to flame, but this is what I've been able to muster...
        At startup, the engine must create oil pressure from none at all,
and must get the viscous fluid moving around as quickly and efficiently as
possible.  The addition of lengths of tubing to some other location,
braided or not, introduces a delay in attaining oil pressure due to the
pump having to pressurize a now much longer, sinuous route. The oil
travelling through all this extra stuff creates fluid friction
continuously, even at optimal pressure.  &quot;They&quot; say the worst engine wear
occurs at startup with no oil anywhere it should be, and no pressure yet to
get it there.  I had put an auxiliary oil cooler in my old bus anyway and
did notice a marked delay in attaining that oil pressure plateau with my
oil psi gauge.  I also noticed that prior to optimal psi, the engine made
ominous sounds, the so-called &quot;expensive noises&quot;.  So I gave it up.
        That old cooler was strapped to the rear left panel fairly close to
the engine. You're suggesting a long hose run (two actually) all the way to
the drivers floor plate, bigass valves for switching summer &amp; winter oil
routes, the cooler, and the ensuing friction these would all cause.  I
dunno, man.  Seems like a helluva run.
        If it were possible to pre-pressure the oil system prior to startup
that might be a neat little creation, minimizing wear to the engine and
enjoying warm feet too.  But I'm not experimenting on the gut$ of my bu$
anymore.  I'm simply going to widen and insulate the hell out of the tube
run, install a sucker fan and maybe try out that suggestion someone else
had of running a hose straight from the inside of the car to the blower fan
above the engine; the &quot;reheater,&quot; I think it was called. Great idea there.
The advantage being reheating the semi-warm air already in the bus instead
of freezing air from outside.  All fairly conventional solutions without
affecting the holistic balance of the engine proper.
        But hey, if you do decide to proceed keep some notes for posterity.
You could be on to something.  An oil psi gauge would be a good idea to
test for any possible anomalies.  Good luck.
