&gt;X-Diagnostic: Not on the accept list

[...]

&gt;
&gt;Hi folks,
&gt;I found you all because a friend on the aircooled VW NG suggested you as a
&gt;better resource than what I was getting there, so I'm putting out my query
&gt;and desparate for help!
&gt;I'm looking for two things: 1.) Advice on the mechanical end of daughter's
&gt;81 vanagon and 2.) a truly reuptable FI VW mechanic in the Greensboro, NC
&gt;area.
&gt;
&gt;Here's the tale.
&gt;In October, daughter drove her 81 vanagon north to Maine for fall break,
&gt;without incident. She had her mechanic here check it over when she got home
&gt;and it was pronounced fit as a fiddle. She bought the car from this
&gt;mechanic who knows it well.
&gt;We did have problems last summer and replaced both an intake and exhaust
&gt;valve, but it was running fine when she left here in October to return to
&gt;NC.
&gt;She got off the highway in Lexington, VA in a rain storm to buy gas.
&gt;Vanagon was stuttering a little as she slowed down, but ran okay into truck
&gt;stop aprking lot. She bought gas, got food and then the van wouldn't start.
&gt;Nada, nothing, zip. AAA came and brought a mechanic who hot wired around
&gt;the relay just before the fuel pump. Bus ran fine all 160 miles to
&gt;Greensboro. Daughter got caught up in classes, work and didn;t get the
&gt;relay replaced immediately, but she did disconnect hot wire when van wasn't
&gt;running. She only used it when absolutely necessary for short jaunts 10 to
&gt;15 miles round trip around town.
&gt;In early dEcember, she replaced the relay, taking extreme care to mark
&gt;wires for connections, etc., rechecked points and plugs, etc., and the
&gt;dratted thing wouldn't start. It would catch for a few seconds/minutes then
&gt;die.
&gt;She and a professor friend took a Muir and with help from another friend
&gt;trouble shot from beginning to end. Nothing. They tried jump starting and
&gt;got it to catch, but it died right away.
&gt;Thinking the relay might be bad she got the parts store to replace it.
&gt;Still nothing.
&gt;Needing to get home, she had it towed to a mechanic who changed oil and put
&gt;in new rocker arm studs for her in early October. He couldn't look at it so
&gt;she ended up borrowing the professor';s 69 camper and brought it home.
&gt;That was 12/17. When she got back to school on 1/12 she called the mechanic
&gt;- who had our 800# and was supposed to call - he said he'd checked
&gt;everything external and couldn't find anything. So, because it backfired
&gt;occasionally when he tried to start it, he thought it must be the cam and
&gt;needed a rebuild to the tune of about $1000!
&gt;Our understanding is that even if there are problems with the cam it will
&gt;still run, just be loud as hell, and even last summer when it lost the
&gt;valve seats it still ran.
&gt;WE are baffled, confused and frustrated.
&gt;We don't have a lot of disposable cash, and she is on full scholarship at
&gt;school.
&gt;She says she's not real comfortable with the mechanic cause he overfilled
&gt;the oil in October and just seems to dismiss her - now we find out!
&gt;The car sits in his lot now, about 15 miles out of Greensbor and we want to
&gt;find a FI specialist cause we really believe that is what is wrong with it,
&gt;but we don't have a clue where to go!
&gt;So, we're looking for mechanical input on what anyone thinks it might be
&gt;and a shop we can take it to.
&gt;If you're somewhere in NC, that makes it even better, because she is
&gt;getting frantic and we have no way to get her home for spring brak without
&gt;the van.
&gt;PLEASE, PLEASE help us!
&gt;Janni
