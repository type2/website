Subject: Re: [T2] acid rust removal

&gt; There are OTC products such as RUST FREE which contain hydrofluoric
&gt; acid- does a great job of removing rust rings from our counter
&gt; tops-where does this acid fit in between HCL and Sulphric acid for rust
&gt; removal?  I did notice that it etched our glazed tile countertop?
&gt;
&gt;    A trace amount at best...Hydrofluoric acid is VERY dangerous and
strong solutions are used to etch glass...VERY, VERY dangerous to
life and limb...A while back a NYC sanitation worker was killed when
someone threw a container of it away and the truck's compactor
broke the container, splashing the hydrofluoric acid into the sanit-
man's face and upper body... ;-(
