Subject: Re: [T2] Horsepower and Torque

Ok, now I have time to type.  Here's the definitive info on torque and
horsepower.

Torque is how much &quot;twist&quot; the engine creates.  The &quot;foot pound&quot; unit is
simply a creative way of quantifying this.  100 foot-pounds is simply 100
pounds applied perpendicular to a lever arm.

This is actually rather easy to handle.  Your transmission and
differential multiply torque with gears.  If you would like to know the
torque applied at the rear wheels, all you have to do is multiply the
engine torque by the gear ratios.  If you have 80 foot pounds of torque, a
transmission ratio of 2.5:1 and a differential ratio of 5:1 then you
simply take 80x2.5x5= 1000 foot-pounds at the rear axle.

How does this relate to acceleration?  Simple, all you need to do is take
the torque at the axle, divide by the rolling radius of the wheel in feet,
and you get the actual force on the bus.  Let's assume the vehicle has 28
inch diameter tires.  All you have to do is divide by two for the
radius(14 inches) and divide by 12 to put it in feet (1.17 feet).  Divide
the rear axle torque by this lever arm and you get 1000/1.17=857 pounds.
This is how hard the vehicle is being pushed forward.  To get
acceleration, you have to find the mass of the vehicle, which is its
weight divided by the acceleration due to gravity.  Assuming a 3000 pound
vehicle, we get 3000/32.2=93.16slugs (yes, the slug is the unit of mass in
the American/Liberian measurement system!)  To find the acceleration, you
simply use f=ma or a=f/m.  857/93.16= 9.19ft/s^2.  1G is 32.2 ft/s^2, so
the acceleration is about 0.28G.  Not too shabby!

Note that I have left a lot of stuff out, such as rotational acceleration
of the engine and drivetrain, as well as frictional losses.  All of these
will deduct from the acceleration.

Note also that nowhere in this analysis does the RPM or vehicle speed
appear.  They don't matter when it comes to calculating acceleration given
torque.  Purists will have to deduct drag from the force applied!

Now for power.

Power is defined as the rate of doing work.  Something that is powerful
can do a lot of work in a short time.  Work is defined as force times
distance.  You apply a force and move a particular distance.  If you can
do this in little time, you're powerful!

A horsepower is defined as the ability to lift 550 pounds a distance of
one foot in one second.  It is commonly abbreviated as 1HP=550ft-lb/s.
This is unfortunate, because the &quot;ft-lb&quot; in the abbreviation are often
mistaken for torque when they are, in fact work.  Same units, different
quantity entirely!

Power can help lift a heavy weight up a tall hill.  It can also help to
accelerate a heavy mass to a high speed (high kinetic energy).  it's all
about delivering energy (potential or kinetic) to an object.

So, torque tells you how hard the car will be pushing on your back at a
particular time.  Horsepower tells you how fast you will be going 10
seconds from now, or how fast you can climb a hill.

If you know the RPM and torque, you can determine horsepower.  All you
have to do is to multiply the torque times the RPM and then multiply the
result by 0.00019.  In equation form:  HP=T(RPM)(.00019).

This equation is somewhat informative.  Notice that the same torque at
higher RPM will result in higher horsepower.  This is how motorcycles get
those outrageous power ratings from tiny engines.  Spin it at 12,000RPM
and you only need 1/4 the push from the pistons as you need at 3000RPM!
