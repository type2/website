Subject: Rusty Exhaust

Importance: Normal

A few weeks back, I added a new Empi dual exhaust to Gretta, my '72 (thanks
to Rob _at_ 72camper_dot_com for the recommendation, and to Ronnie _at_ Old Volks for
the great price).  The easy install, improved ground clearance
and mellow tone are great, but I have already started to get quite a bit of
surface rust.  I would like to catch this before it becomes a big problem,
but don't know where to start.  Has anybody had good luck using high temp
paints on their exhaust to stop rust?  Anybody have any experience with the
Por15 high temp stuff?  I don't expect to get 10 years out of a low cost
aftermarket system, but it does seem that I might expect a bit more than one
summer before the rust sets in...  Please help.

							Thanks in advance,
								Jay
