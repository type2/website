Subject: Re: Cylinder Head temp sensor - '75 2.0  FI
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.3.96.990227170843.5745A-100000_at_techsrv1.tech.mtu_dot_edu&gt;

&gt; From: &quot;Danny Knox&quot; &lt;dannymk_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Hey Volks:
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any easy way to get at the cylinder head temp sensor?  On my
&gt; '75 2.0 FI its right underneath one of the manifold tubes below the tin.
&gt; I understand theres a tool for this - will a deep socket work just the
&gt; same?  Because there's a torque spec for this I'm assuming you have to
&gt; remove the manifold tube - otherwise, how would you be able to get your
&gt; torque wrench in there?

--&gt; The torque *probably* isn't critical, but be careful.  On my '77
engine (where the sensor is in a little different location, so you can get
at it with a normal box-end wrench) someone over-tightened this and
stripped the threads in the head.  This caused all sorts of fun problems
with the sensor working itself loose and making the engine miss, which I
tried various ways of preventing until the rest of the FI died from
unrelated causes, making the point moot. ;) 

When you put the thing in, make it just snug, so it won't work loose.
Don't overtighten it.  No lock-tite, either, it has to make electrical
contact.  I wouldn't remove it at all unless you have to, but I'm assuming
you wouldn't be trying it it hadn't shorted out or something.
