Subject: VW Canvas still around?


&gt; Hello all!
&gt;
&gt;  My bus should be back from the body shop in a month or so.  That means
itll
&gt;  be time to put the whole thing back together again soon.  I have a huge
&gt;  pile of parts sitting in my house including new rubber all around and
some
&gt;  misc engine goodies.  I do need some new poptop canvas to replace the
ripped
&gt;  stuff I removed six months ago.  I was planning on going with PLF, but
&gt;  this talk latley has got me thinking whether I should find a saffer place
&gt;  to send my hard earned green.
&gt;
&gt;  I remember a place called VW Canvas in Texas, but I cant get their Web
site
&gt;  to work.  Anybody know if their still around?  Anybody got their canvas
from
&gt;  them want to tell me how it worked out, quality and buisness wise?

 It's Called V W CANVAS 104 Hillcrest La Vernia, Texas 78121
830-779-2136 ...www.flashnet/-vwcanvas
email: vwcanvas_at_flash_dot_net
I bought a canvas from them about 1 year ago, very good quality, and good
service too. I think I paid about $250 for the delux model and about $50 for
the cot.
Also you might try http://www.poptops_dot_com they are in Malibu, SoCal.  Never
bought anything from them.  They advertise in hot vw mag.

Good luck,
