Subject: '79 Camper hardstart

My '79 Auto 2 Liter F.I. camper will turn over but not start UNTIL i put the
gas to the floor, then after a couple seconds, it will fire up...This is
only when cold...Is this the symptom of a bad cold start valve? or perhaps
lack of fuel pressure at cold?

I surfed the archives but nothing refers to applying the accelerator to make
it start...

maybe my feuly wants to be carbed..LOL

Thanks
