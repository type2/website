&gt; &gt; Final thought:  You really cannot do this correctly without the alignment
&gt; &gt; machine!  If you have one of those available to you, have at it!  There is
&gt;
&gt;Bullfrogs.  Every byhand toe setting i've done (either using the
&gt;tapemeasure method on fwd wassers, or my nice sliding rod set i made that
&gt;works on buses) has been dead on once I could get someone to put it on a
&gt;rack.

'Fraid I have to agree.  On my other vehicle I change camber and toe 
settings all the time (before, during and after races).  If I had to pay to 
have it done each time, it would bankrupt me, not to mention that it would 
be extremely impractical.

By sheer coincidence, this is being discussed right now on another list I'm 
on (RoadRace/Autocross Mustang list).  Here are some useful quotes:

Turn Plates - you need to have your front wheels on these to do a proper 
alignment as friction between the tire and the ground will throw off your 
readings:

&quot;I came up with an easy solution to the turn-plate issue recently, after
getting frustrated trying to get repeatable camber and toe measurements.

buy some cheap commercial vinyl tiles, and put some heavy grease between
them.  you want the commercial tiles, because they have smooth surfaces
(cheaper and more durable than textured).

you'll be amazed at how well these work.  the steering effort drops
tremendously when the car is sitting on them.  i can move the steering
wheel with my finger, and that's with the engine off and 3 degrees of
camber.  and karl quickly discovered that you can't torque the lug nuts
while the car is sitting on the greased tiles, because the top tile just
slides out.

cost: about $2 for tiles.  the only catch is that they're relatively
fragile, but i've used them several times so far.  i'm going to buy a few
more the next time i go to home depot.&quot;

For camber:

&quot;Well, for a camber gauge, I think the best is a SmartCamber set-up.  I 
don't have one yet, but borrow my chassis guys' all the time.  It's also 
great for setting up control arm angles, for leveling the car (based on the 
roll cage angle) and other stuff as well.  My Halibrand camber gauge does 
the job however.&quot;
