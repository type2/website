Subject: Re: [T2] left heater cable

[...]

if the plastic piece is missing, it is just crap build-up?
does seem like the left tube has a smaller OD and ID than the right. welp,
i'll just crank &amp; reef on it and if it stretches or snaps, no spare cable
this time. no big deal. who needs an ancient cable that bad. thanks crew. -

&gt;[...] I just went through the same thing this week, except the one I'm
&gt;parting out is a '69.  There is a little plastic piece in the end of the
&gt;metal tube, presumably to keep crap out of the tube.  Sometimes the little
&gt;bugger is hard to get out.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; hi list - why does the left heater cable never want to come out form me.
&gt;&gt; i'm breaking down a 68 parts bus and once again i am stumped on that
&gt;&gt; cable. seems like the tube in the rear is smaller, and the metal bit at
&gt;&gt;the end
&gt;&gt; it the cable never wants to pass through that tube. a yank on it it and it
&gt;&gt; jams up. opposite effect on the right side. heavens-to-betsy if i do get
&gt;&gt; it out and i have to re-install someday. someone share the trickery?  -
