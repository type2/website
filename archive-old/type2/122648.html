Subject: Question about horn and windshield washer system

Hi,

I have a '77 stock FI westy and my horn has had intermittent problems. I
am of the mind that a horn is Very important! I want to fix this problem
before spring comes. It works most of the time if I have the bus running
and driving down the road straight. As soon as I turn the steering
wheel, in a turn it will absolutely not work. When I first got the bus I
had my local shop check it out as well as all the other diagnostics to
see what shape the mechanics of the bus were. As far as the horn problem
they just cleaned the connections and it did work only for a short
while. I want to fix it for good though. I am pleased to say the bus
runs strong... wonderful actually. I am considering how hard it is to
take the steering wheel off and then what to do, rewire the horn? Any
and all help would be greatly appreciated; diagrams and pictures of what
I should do would be fantastic.

As well as the wiper washer system, it was taken out not by me so I have
no reference to put it back. Richard Atwell has great documentation for
parts, thanks. But I would like to see a picture of it installed inside
the bus. Also where to buy the valves and tee connectors?

Thanks as always for the wonderful help:-)

Peace

Meg
