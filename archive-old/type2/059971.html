Subject: Re: oil pump cover gasket

The measurement Bentley gives is what I use.  After using a feeler gauge
to determine the spacing between the gears and the cover plate, I will use
the gasket that produces the correct amount of freespace.
This space is important, in that it is part and partial to determining oil
pressure.
