Subject: Re: [T2] Brakes are NOT RIGHT

Tina-
Brake problem diagnosis is fun!
Not many parts, good system to learn.
They look amazingly similar to the brakes on your SB,
which should have been serviced many times in fifteen years.

The bus pulls left, so that brake works, m'kay?
(This does not mean it doesn't need attention:)
Noise? Bad brake shoes may have no lining left,
or be worn down to the rivets, and the drums may be scored.

The front drums are fairly easy to get off.
You may have some trouble reversing the star adjusters
if the shoes are not adjusted regularly, but may not have to
if the drums slide over them.

You will be doing this job twice, unless you have the parts.
Replace shoes in sets, have the drums inspected for lathe turning
or replace them. check the hoses, metal lines and brake springs too.
Clean out the wheel cylinders, replace fluid, bleed front and rear.
Grease those star adjusters and clean/repack the wheel bearings.
This is all classic Muir stuff. You deserve good brakes!

&gt; I got in my 69 Westi after a huge thunderstorm here in Tulsa, Oklahoma &amp; my bus breaks screamed &amp; the bus pulled to the left w/ a nasty grinding sound.  I continued to drive &amp; to 'test' the breaks &amp; the screaming stopped sorta but the pulling is still there &amp; I do have stopping power.  My bus has never done this before, but it's my new addition to my VW addiction.  I've gotta take a 160 mile trip at the end of the month &amp; this is got me on edge. 
&gt; I've searched the archive on where to start trouble shooting but am getting overwhelmed w/ info.  I read every post daily since joining the list just to learn more about type 2's.  I cant afford to take the bus to the bus boys here in town.  
&gt; Where should I start 'trouble shooting'?  Im off to read my 'how to keep your vw alive' manual since its help me keep my 71super beetle on the road for 15 years.
&gt; any help will be put to use guys &amp; girls!  Thanks in advance!
