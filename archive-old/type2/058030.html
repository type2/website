Subject: RE: Timing Explainations

Volks: Just a comment on all the timing marks ATDC, BTDC discussion.
Even though I understand the subject, I'm finding it hard to follow the
discussions, 
becasue I dont know wheter you are refering to the case, or the pulley when 
you say &quot;to the right of the 0 mark  is obviously BLASTSO....&quot;. So I can't
sdecide whether
the post is right or wrong. Imagine the confusion for someone who is trying
to learn from this?

Can people always and &quot;on the pulley&quot;, or &quot;on the case&quot; every time you refer
to a direction?

For example the above would become:

Parts of the pulley to the right of the 0 mark on the case are obviously
BTDC becase they 
passed the 0 mark on the case before the notch on the pulley.

Just a suggestion.
