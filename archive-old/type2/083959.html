Subject: Re: 1700 exhaust leaks


There is a hole in the head for the air injection system; this hole
starts in the exhaust valve chamber, and exits on either side of the
intake runners.  You will need to plug these holes; there are several
ways to do this.  You can re-use your air pump plumbing and crimp &amp;
braze the tubes shut, or screw some other type of bolt into the hole.  I
believe that the thread pitch used here is something non-standard; I had
a hard time trying to one myself (I could only find them in bulk). 
Anyway, I can't remember what the thread pitch is, but someone in
ListLand might.  You could always bring the piece of air injection
tubing that threads into the head to a hardware store and ask them to
size it for you.

If you use a bolt, beware how far you thread it in.  Too far and you
will bottom-out on the exhaust valve.  Use that piece of original air
injection tubing which threads into the head as a guide on how far in to
thread the bolt.

Hope this helps
-Roger

&gt; after rebuiling a 1700 engine and re-installing in my 73.I have exhaust
&gt; leaks that I cannot locate.  
&gt; I did follow advice and file the exhaust headers flat before assembling.
&gt; The reason I beleive there is leaks is because of the loudness both under
&gt; the engine and above.
&gt; Last night I was running it in the dark and notice a small blue glow under
&gt; the tinn next to the intake manifold (F.I.)  
&gt; Is there a &quot;hole&quot; in the head that connects to the exhaust port that is
&gt; somehow open?  I did not install an air pump, or EGR, but did block off the
&gt; egr inlet to the FI air dist chamber.
