Subject: AVP

Saw your forwarded message today finally-

&gt; I don't mean to sound negative, but in truth, your's
&gt; is the only 'positive' testimonial for AVP that I've
&gt; heard in the 2+ years I've been on this list :-(

I've written two letters to the list this year about my dealings with
AVP and the positive experience I've had with them.  6,000 miles on my
2.0 L  in my '76 Westy.  You can see
the whole writeup on www_dot_net-link_dot_net/~flyboy/vw.html
