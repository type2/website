Re: Bad 1.3/1.5/1.6L Dansk mufflers!

Not everything you don't understand is a production mistake!

While Dansk/Jopex stuff is indeed junk, especially everything muffler
and heat exchanger related, mufflers with the pipe exiting on the right
side are perfectly legitimate.

These were original VW equipment too. But even from the german fiche I
can not figure out when there was a formal switch, they may have been
used concurrently. My 72 Bus with the 1600 engine (german model) came
with that muffler and it was still the first.

Maybe these mufflers never made it to the US, but I still have one of
those mufflers (new) and the corresponding tailpipe (new).

Jopex probably just shipped the wrong batch and RMMW doesn't seem to
have any quality control or clue anyway (judging from their junk I've
seen). They do charge full retail though.
Definitely a last resort kinda place to buy from.

BTW: Even if it says Dansk or Jopex on the part or box it is very often
brazilian anyway, thats where they buy a lot of their stuff.

On the other hand there is some really good brazilian stuff, we just
don't get to see much of it in the US, because places like RMMW only buy
the cheapest stuff possible. The average customer doesn't know any
better.
