&gt;             What is the trick to balancing the motor and tranny on the
&gt;floor jack and jacking it all up in there without dumping it?


I took a 2X12 and routed a shallow circle in it, so that the sump nestled in
the hollow and the 2x12 supported the pan all the way across.  Then I lifted
the 2x12 with my jack, and it went very smoothly.  If you have the time and
want to send me your postal address I'll mail you a copy of my engine dolly
drawing, which has the 2X12 cradle on it.  Or, Michael Wagner scanned one
and put it out there at http://home.pacbell_dot_net/mwagner/dolly.pdf
You have to squint a little, but it's readable.

Last clue:  sweep the floor beneath the engine compartment so the wheels can
move smoothly.
