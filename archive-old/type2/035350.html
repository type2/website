Subject: spare wheel cover?

Hi,

I know someone wrote about this before (I checked the archives &amp; couldn't
find anything)... Anyway, I'm looking for a spare wheel cover with the vw
logo on it.  I know I saw them for sale somewhere, but for the life of me
can't remember where.  If someone knows where I could get one (with the VW
logo on it), could you please email me.

Thanks!
