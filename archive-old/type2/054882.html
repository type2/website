Subject: RE: Odd things

Today, I was looking at a friends new find.  It is  a 68 hardtop westy.  

I noticed a couple of things.  

1. The vent windows in the front doors, do not open.  I mean they have no
latch and the rubber completely seals them in.

2. It  doesn't have a door covering the gas tank.

Is this something Volkswagen did on panel vans.

Hi Richard,

Weird, sounds just like my 75, weren't these standard VW changes on later
models, can't remember what year they came in but it defiantley wasn't 68!!!
At least not here in Australia.  In saying that though we had many different
combinations that weren't available in other countries, not so much the
Buses but the Bugs.  I guess the windows could have been retro fitted but
the gas cap door sounds like a lot of hassle, unless it just fell off ;)

Cheers
Steve
