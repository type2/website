Subject: seating piston rings on '71 Type 2
Message-ID: &lt;37FA4EDF.4B2CA8EE_at_crosslink_dot_net&gt;

Had cylinders/pistons/rings, etc. replaced on my '71 stock 1600 a while
back. Put 3-4000 miles on it running non synthetic oil (changing oil at
appropriate intervals) and assumed that the rings were fully seated at
that time. After that, had to remove the heads and while the heads were
off, I removed the cylinders to inspect the walls (which looked ok as
expected). Now everything is back together. The question is this. By
removing/reinstalling the cylinders (on the same pistons they came off
of, of course), do I need to wait another 3K miles for the rings to
reseat? I am curious about this because I want to change to synthetic
oil and don't want to change until the rings are seated.
