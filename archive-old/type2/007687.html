At least here in the Pacific Northwest, Eagle Hardware carries a variety
of steel corner and peak fittings to be used in assembling a shelter with
a tarp cover.  They're designed to be used with metal tubing like
electrical conduit, which is very inexpensive.

The first time I saw these fittings in the store I was struck by their
very close resemblance to the fittings used in the assembly of a Westy
tent frame.  Hmmmm..........
