volks

 just finished some work on my 78, auto tranny stock 2l with Pentronix.

put on rebuilt heads and 72-74 exhaust system, got her back together and
on the road..runs nice... but I can't get the idle smooth and at idle
there is a small backfire every so often...and when I first start it she
idles and then rev's up, then settles back to 950rpm.  Does the rev up
thing til she's warm slowly fading out. I have suspected a
vacuum leak but try as I might I cannot find one.  at any speed over idle
it runs pretty near perfect.
  tiny exhaust leak on #1, part has been back ordered so can't do anything
about that for the moment.
  while apart replaced the temp sensor, one hyd lifter, and the usual oil,
filters etc.  have futzed with the timing and while it seems to help a
little it does not solve the problem...

????what am I missing???

TIA
Bob
