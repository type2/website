Subject: Re: Weird stuff happening

Howard,
The backfiring on deceleration is often a sign of too advanced timing. You 
might want to check that again, and also check to make sure that you have 
the two distributor vacuum hoses on correctly and not reversed. Also, the 
nipples at the throttle valve to which these hoses attach have very fine 
lumen, so you might want to poke a needle thru them to make sure they aren't 
plugged. If you haven't done it recently, removing and cleaning the throttle 
valve may be helpful (but get a new gasket before you reinstall it).
