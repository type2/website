Subject: Re: [T2] weber carbs, fuel pump, etc.

one problem is that webers are designed for NO MORE than 3.5psi.

When you exceed this, the engine will not &quot;flood&quot; as most people understand
it, but the extra pressure puts pressure on the needle/seat, and effectively
raises the fuel level, which brings the main jets in sooner (rich running),
and you are running on both the idle AND main jets at 2500-3000.

BTW, the chrome regulators with a cheesy dial on them are garbage, get them
away from your car into the nearest trash can, and get a quality Holley or
Mallory regulator.
