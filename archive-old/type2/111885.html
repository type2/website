&gt; Ok, here's the poop.

euuwww! yuck.

&gt; I'm driving my 1970 to work this morning and while shifting between
&gt; 3rd and 4th,  It turn over and almost catches, but it won't fire up.
&gt; I checked for spark on 4 and I've got it. Do I need to check all
&gt; four or is that a dumb question. The spark at the coil was orange,
&gt; so St.  Muir says replace the coil, I'll do that. I haven't chacked
&gt; my points yet, but they probably need replacing as well.  

Check the points first. If they are off you can very well get a really
lousy spark. If you manage to get the bus running and still have a
loss of power, try pulling each plug wire at a time and see if the
engine speed reduces. if so more work is needed, but I would check the
points first.
