It's funny how it has been this way for 30 years or so.

&gt;BTW, I encourage you to visit www.volkswagen_dot_de and have a look at 
&gt;the new VW camper. You can cut to the chase by going here

That's the first Eurovan camper that's appealed to me in a long time. I really don't like the white/grey color scheme and laminates used in the US models. I rather prefer the wood to the white RV look.

&gt;As for the &quot;New Microbus &quot; round headlights at the very least :)

My big objection to the design in general is that it doesn't honor the old bus in the way the New Beetle does: it toy and novelty appeal is too high when they should be striving for an enduring design. I hope they get it right by 2005.
