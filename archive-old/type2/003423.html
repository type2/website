&gt;I am i the process of getting all the parts together to replace the
&gt; exhuast and heater boxes on my 78 Westy.
&gt; I am going to put on heater boxes from a 72-74. I have the boxes and the
&gt; exhaust new from the Bus Depot.
&gt; I went with VW boxes and the stainless muffler. I am wondering what else
&gt; I will need to complete the conversion.

You will need the left and right heater tubes that go between the heater
boxes and the flapper valves for a 72-74. They are round on the box end.
Your 78's are oval.

You will need the long alternator support/adjusting bracket for a 72-74. It
bolts on the outside of 72-74 boxes. On your 78, it bolted to the welded-on
bracket on top of the exhaust pipe between the box and the transverse pipe.
You cannot make the 78 fit.

Didn't your 78 have EGR? ....... Does your state not have smog checks?
