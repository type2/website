 &gt;After installing my shiny rebuilt 2.0 hydraulic lifter AVP engine in my 79
 &gt;bus a couple months ago, I noticed that the oil pressure takes a really long
 &gt;time to build up when I start it up.  On a cool day, it takes a good 30
 &gt;seconds before the oil warning lite goes off and on a cold day, it takes
 &gt;about 45 seconds.  During this 30 to 45 seconds, the engine makes a terrible
 &gt;racket, but quiets down once the pressure comes up.  When the pressure
 &gt;eventually comes up, it comes up really fast, like just a couple of seconds.
 &gt;
 &gt;I have just changed oil (Castrol 20-50) and a new German oil filter and the
 &gt;problem persists.  Also, I have an oil pressure gage, so I know that the oil
 &gt;warning lite is working right. &gt;&gt;

my first two things to check would be the pressure relief valves and 
springs.....and next i wonder about the value of running 20w/50 oil when its 
cold.....that is kinda thick dontcha think??  just my opinion.
