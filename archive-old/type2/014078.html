Subject: How wide can tyres be in a bus without cutting the guards?

This was posted just before the big crash of the server, re-posting on the off-
chance that someone may have some information available.

Bit of a strange query here, I'm starting in on a project on a '75 DC  
basketcase (rusted out), and am trying to work out what the maximum width would 
be (front &amp; rear) for standard height tyres to fit in without cutting the 
guards (IE: keeping the tyres within the standard body line, possibly trimming 
the inner lip).

I've seen figures for raised Busses with tall off-road tyres, but that's not 
the way I'm going. (Got offered an deal I couldn't refuse on a set of Mercedes 
stud pattern 18&quot; mags http://neale_dot_org/images/antera.jpg .)
 
Any suggestions or information would be greatly appreciated.
