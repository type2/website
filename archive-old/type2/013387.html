&gt; Arch, list:
&gt; The belly pans used with the BA-6's are REMOVEABLE
&gt; belly pans held on with a
&gt; bunch of bolts (14, maybe). Prime reason is to
&gt; protect the heater and hoses
&gt; from damage, but possibly also protects the
&gt; immediate environment (under the
&gt; bus) from the heater while in operation. It would
&gt; also slightly stiffen the
&gt; structure, but I'd guess that was not the intent.


That's good to know, as on my list of mods I would
like to make is the addition of a gasoline version of
the Espar D1LC to my camper...
