Subject: Re: Les Schwab Brakes/Shocks...(not a tire question)

Another option to consider is a privately owned muffler/brake shop.  I
guess I'm  a little biased as I have a friend that has two shops.   It's
quite possible that you are dealing with the owner or a manager that has
been there a long time.  In fact my friend used to be a service manager
for a VW/Porsche dealership for many years.  

Once I went to a privately owned shop to get a pipe swadged.  They did it
for free and said have fun - probably because I was 17 years old at the
time - but I'll never forget that!

As to the Odyssey, I been thorugh the same - lights on form the kids! 
wish it had one of those automatic timers.  Anyone know of a decent way
to install one of those in any other vechicle, such as our VW (and other)
vans?
