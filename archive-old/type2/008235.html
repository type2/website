&gt; Hi there,
&gt; 
&gt; One of my friends is looking for a pair of springplates of a '68 to
'71 bus.
&gt; It appears they are not that easy to find over here.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any to sell or know of a source?

I was wanting to know what the difference is between the 68-71 and the
72-79 spring plates. I have some for a 73 that I don't need.
