Subject: Re: [T2] 1974 van dies when warm

Hi Jeff,

You definitely have a fuel supply issue. I would first recommend 
checking your fuel filter for debris.

Have you tried removing the gas cap? It might be a blocked air vent, 
creating a vaccuum in the tank that eventually overpowers the fuel pump.

If it's not the filter or the vent then it is a blockage in the tank or 
a bad pump. Check the flow from the tank and if that's ok, replace the 
pump. Unfortunately the 1974 mechanical pump is expensive and very hard 
to find, but a cheaper electrical pump will work just as well, you just 
have a bit more work to do to mount it.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; After it dies, if I look down the throat of the carburator and pull on 
&gt; the throttle, no gas shoots into the carburator.  Could this be vapor 
&gt; lock?  We live in Seattle if that's of any significance but it happens 
&gt; in both winter and summer.  If you suspect vapor lock, is there a way 
&gt; to test for that?  I've also read about an egr valve and similar 
&gt; problems but am not sure what it looks like or if our van has it 
&gt; anymore. Could this be the problem?  If so, how is this corrected?  If 
&gt; there's anything else you  recommend checking I'll be happy to take a 
&gt; look.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
&gt;
