Subject: Re: outside lighting _at_ camp

&gt;A while ago I took an old hurrican lantern that leaked and put in a 12
&gt;volt light socket where the wick is (was).. mounted a little switch on
&gt;the fuel tank part... drilled a rather large hole in the bottom so I
&gt;could clean it out real well. got some lamp cord and wired it up with
&gt;the other ends having battery post clips (clamps?).
&gt;   It was very portable and was nice if I needed to work on das bus on
&gt;the side of the road... gave off lots of light!
&gt;   I ended up giving it to a kid I met at a VW meet here in Seattle. He
&gt;lived in his bus (I dont) he needed it (I didnt). But I did field test
&gt;it for around a year before giving it up... think I will make another..
&gt;
&gt;Also, it worked well when the power went out.

Having concerns about draining my van battery while camping I was 
thinking of buying an automotive battery, a good size one. Then use 
12 volt florescent lamps  clipped to the terminals to light up the 
interior and the camp. It would be good for powering my lap top 
computer as well if I rig up a cigarette lighter receptacle. I could 
then charge up the batter at home.
