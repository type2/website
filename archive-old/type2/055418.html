&gt; I'm not surprised that your bus leaks.  Stock '71 buses break when they're 
&gt; driven at 70 MPH for long periods.  If you need to drive 70 you should get 
&gt; some other kind of vehicle.  A '71 bus can be very inexpensive to operate and 
&gt; last a long time if you don't abuse it.  Also, I'm not surprised that you 
&gt; &quot;can do it with your eyes closed at this point&quot;.  You're going to get lots 
&gt; more practice at pulling and repairing that engine if you keep driving at 70.

Was that 70MPH actual or indicated?  VW speedometers can be very
optomistic.  My '71 is happiest at 58MPH or so _actual_ but the speedo is
pointing at 72+MPH at that speed!
