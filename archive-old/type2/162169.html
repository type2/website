Subject: Re: [T2] What engine in my 77? GD or CJ ??

&gt;While looking online for a gascap for my 77 Canadian Westy, Rockauto asked me for either the
&gt;2.0 GD or 2.0 CJ engine. I didn't realize two engines were offered in 77. Which would I have, and
&gt;what are the diffs??

GD - USA with FI
CJ - Europe with carbs

&gt; While I'm at it, who's got a stock gascap for sale??

The chrome locking and non-locking gascap are hard to find but they fit and work best. The last locking gaspcap I bought was from eBay but since then Bus Depot has started to carry this OEM Blau gas cap again:

Be sure to avoid the black version of this gas cap: It's for a non-Type 2 VW and it fits poorly.
