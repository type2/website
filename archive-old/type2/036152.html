Subject: Crossdrilling rotors

People usually crossdrill rotors to save weight.  Don't think the three or
so pounds it would save would help much on a bus.  Crossdrilling also
supposedly helps when brakes are wet (a debatable subject when talking about
a 3000+ lb vehicle).  Though they probably would slow rotor wear in very
sandy/dirty areas (if crossdrilled in the correct pattern).   Actually can
cause rotor overheating in traffic, especially in hilly areas,  due to loss
of mass, so the slight advantage you might gain in wet conditions could
cause your rotors to warp more easily.
