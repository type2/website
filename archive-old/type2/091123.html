Subject: 70 westy fuel gauge adjustment?

ok, i also have a question about fuel guages. (is it just me or does it
SEEM like i have nothing but problems all of a sudden?)

ever since we got the bus running and i filled the tank, it doesnt read
completely full. it reads about 3/4. when i get to &quot;R&quot; i still have
something like 1/4 tank... actually, it is pretty close to right, but i
know i am not on fumes when i get to &quot;R&quot;.

is there an adjstment like on my 65 beetle guage? or is there something
else i can do to adjust it?

thanks, more to come...
chris
