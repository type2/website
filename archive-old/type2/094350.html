&gt; It is a non-poptop Westy. Westfalia made 3 models:
&gt; P-21 has no poptop. Has sink, cooler, bed in back, main table in rear, childs
&gt; cot in front.
&gt; P-22 has poptop. All of above, and bed in top.
&gt; P-27 is the deluxe Westy. All of the above plus 2 burner stove, fridge instead
&gt; of cooler, front table, storage container/stool between front seats.

Thanks Karl. I also wondered where the stool and front table.

My Canadian model's m-plate says P22. It seems it's the same as the US model
but it has the original stove.

&gt; That 77 has a few things wrong:
&gt; It is white, appears to be originally white because the front interior is
&gt; white. Pastel white is correct for the 77 P-21 Westy. But the green plaid is
&gt; wrong. Supposed to be yellow plaid. The yellow curtains are correct.
&gt; Not sure about the &quot;signature edition&quot; headliner......

It looks yellow to me, like my own cloth.

The 76 dealer brochure seems to call this Orange Plaid while 77 dealer
brochure calls it Green Red.  I think it's the same fabric as long as it has
the red stripe in the pattern.

I emailed Vincent Molenaar a while back and he said the European models had
names like Helsinki.  Does anyone know all the names and what they
designate?
