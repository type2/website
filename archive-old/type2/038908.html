&gt;Hello all,
&gt;
&gt;im bran new to the list!  My girlfriend and I have been planning a cross
&gt;country trip for a couple of months now and are planning to leave in
&gt;June.  We will be doing alot of camping and backpacking so we wanted to
&gt;get some insight or suggestions as to the essential things we would need
&gt;to take with us.  Not only for the bus but for ourselves as well.  We
&gt;plan to travel for awhile and have become overwhelmed with the things we
&gt;are taking with us.  We also have our two dogs, so suggestions for them
&gt;would also be appreciated.  Again any advice from anyone who has done
&gt;this or traveled for awhile would be fantastic! Thanks for the help and
&gt;the insight

     Less is more. I tend to packrat stuff on trips, and it makes things 
harder. Took me about 20 minutes to setup and break camp on the Inuvik 
run(everyone else took about 5). Halfway through that trip I was wishing 
I'd packed a bit lighter... Bring only that which you  are sure you'll 
need. If you think you *might* need it, leave it at home. Engine parts 
excepted, of course...


Peace,
