Subject: Re: [T2] New Carb Question

The carb I sent to Richard Carey for rebuilding also leaked gasoline when 
it came back to me.  I took it back over (I'm local) and they reworked it 
(within a day), but it still leaked fuel in the same manner as you describe 
when I reinstalled it. My fuel bowl would actually weep and become damp 
with fuel, almost like it was porous. I returned it to them and exchanged 
it for another rebuilt carb.  The second one was fine.

Sometimes you will get a bad one, but trust me, they will make it right for 
you.

&gt; Here's the details:
&gt; 1600 DP
&gt; 34PICT3 carb
&gt; 
&gt; I recently noticed a few drips of gas coming from the side of my carb
&gt; where the accelerator linakage connects to the throttle shaft (right
&gt; side of carb). The gas only drips for a few minutes after the engine
&gt; has been shut off, but it is enough of a concern that I'd like to fix
&gt; the probelm fast. I ordered up a rebuilt carb a few months back from
&gt; Richard Carey. The new (rebuilt) carb looks great, but for some reason
&gt; I can't get it to work right.
