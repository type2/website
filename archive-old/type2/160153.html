Subject: Re: [T2] Starting troubles in San Diego

Hi P.

Two thoughts come to mind:

A. Have you checked to see if the engine is spinning freely? Are you
100% certain it's in neutral?  If it's locked up for some reason then
it's not the starter that's at fault.

B. Check the entire current path from battery - starter - tranny -
chassis -battery. ALL of those connections need to be clean and
secure, or it won't charge OR start reliably.

To answer your questions.

1. Unlikely.
2. Possibly.
3. Unlikely.
4. Dunno... My alternator is different from yours, and it's too wet
outside to climb under the bus right now anyway.


Happy Trails,

&gt;       Thats where it stands for the moment.
&gt;   1.  Could I have damaged the new Solenoid?
&gt;       2.  I suppose it could be the Battery, as the charge is low.
&gt;   3.  Could the Bosch Relay be an issue?  Do they go out?
&gt;     4. - On the Alternator, under the plate where the wiring goes,
&gt; there is a small black box attached to the center of the Alternator
&gt; and a small wire running from the black box to a nearby post also
&gt; on the Alternator.  My assumption is that its a ground wire, but
&gt; then why have it in the box?  Anyway, point is, I re-used this part
&gt; as the new Alternator did not come with it and the guy at Napa
&gt; couldnt tell me what it was.  What is this part and is it possible
&gt; that it is damaged and needs replacing?
