Joe,


I disassembled, cleaned and reassembled both of the calipers from my
78partsbus for use on the 74.

Not a biggie.  Inspect everything for damage. Careful with the rubber parts. 

You can use very fine (600-1000 grit) sandpaper to clean the bores and
pistons.  

Clean everything with soap and water and then dry it all thoroughlly after
using the fine grit and maybe some steel wool to get all the buildup off of
the steel parts.  Be certain everything is absolutely clean and dry before you
decide to reassemble.

Lube it all up with DOT3 and slap it back together.

If none of the parts are seriously damaged (o-rings ripped into, pistons or
bores gouged)  it will work fine.  Follow your Bentley.

You can do the same to you master cylinder.

have fun,

clark in ky

&gt; Hi gang - finally got the bus on the road (new case was the charm) and
&gt; now I'm working on the front brakes because the left was
&gt; sticking/grabbing.
&gt; 
&gt; There was only one bolt holding the left caliper on.
&gt; 
&gt; I've read some of the tricks for removing the pistons -- I was able to
&gt; get the right-side ones out with a foot-pump, but the left is really
&gt; gummed in.  My mech suggested reconnecting the hydraulics and using
&gt; brake system pressure to push them out, so I'll try that.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, ordering repair kits, pads, wheel bearings, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Question: seems I've heard that splitting the caliper halves is a BAD
&gt; THING, although my mech seemed surprised at that and said the main thing
&gt; is not to lose the seal, as it's not available.  His main argument for
&gt; splitting them is to make it easier to clean out the bores.
&gt; 
&gt; So what's your experience with splitting/cleaning calipers?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Joe
