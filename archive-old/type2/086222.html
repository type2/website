Subject: Type2_dot_com definitions and terms page

Bus content,
The Type2_dot_com definitions webpage says my 77 has an 1800cc motor. I always 
believed it to be a 2.0 FI motor as stock for 1977 T2. Am i wrong about 
this? Any experts want to take sides, correct me, or change the web page??
Thanks,
Jeremy
PS. why did i have to ask about FLAPS anyway....  :)
