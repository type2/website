&gt; So what's this anti-GEX stuff I keep reading about?  Has their quality
&gt; fallen down?

I am still in court related activities so I can't say too much yet.

but my suit was for &quot;Non Conforming goods&quot;  under my state law that means
they did not deliver what was promised, in the way of material and work
performed.  I have won a judgement, more details will follow.  

you can read between the lines and make your own conclusions, mine went a
total of 3396 miles, 100% stock

&gt; Hubby's bug has a 1600 GEX purchased about 15 years ago, that has almost
&gt; 200,000 miles on it--he still uses it to commute to work . . .He has
&gt; quite religious 'bout changing the oil every 2,000-2500 miles or so.
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like we shouldn't be counting on GEX anymore, especially for our
&gt; vans. . .

I wouldn't trust GEX to bury my dead dog!
