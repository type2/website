&gt;How do I hook up the electrical connections for the fuel pump? Do I just run 
&gt;the positive and neg to their respective terminals on the battery?

Having a toggle switch in between would be nice.

&gt;What do I connect to the positive side of the coil? Should this be run to 
&gt;the battery?

Yes, and also with a toggle switch.

&gt;Besides the wire from the alternater and the wire from the starter, what do 
&gt;I run to the starter? A wire from positive battery to the bolt that doesn't 
&gt;connect to the starter?

I missed the earlier thread...why do you need to run the alternator for the test the engine?

For the starter you need to provide postive to terminal 30 and negative to a very good ground like the transmission case. I used jumper cables. Then to activate the starter just bridge terminal 50 with 30 temporarily.

In my photo you can see the jumper cables and the remorte starter switch.
