Subject: '69 carb problem solved;-) &lt;I hope!&gt; Coil questions...

All,

I wanted to let everyone know that the problem with my
carb dripping fuel (motor off) has been cured, and to
thank Andy for his helpful advice &lt;though I didn't
follow all of it!&gt;.

It turned out to be the float/valve, not a shot
carb....duh. Andy and a friend of mine both suggested
I look there, and they were right. 

The float seemed to be fine, with no obvious
cracks/leaks and was floating well with no sound of
fuel when I shook it (high-tech testing, huh?). The
valve seemed fine, too...moved freely and easily with
a light touch...it also blocked all air flow when I
blew into the fuel-inlet (even more high-tech). But it
just wasn't stopping the fuel like it was supposed
to...

Friend #1 (who's a VW mechanic who lives in another
state) suggested I bend the tab on the float that
connects with the valve *up* to stop the flow. Andy
said don't mess with it, because it'll screw up the
float level.

The bus certainly wasn't driveable in it's current
state, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to try (hell,
anything's better than nothing, right?).

So I took it apart and looked at it...but it seemed
that bending the tab *up* would make the problem
worse, so I followed my gut instinct and bent it
*down*. 

It works just fine, no leaks, and no power loss on the
steepest hill I could find! I shut off the motor
midway through my test-drive (thank God Taco Bell has
a well-lit parking lot;-) and no leaks after several
minutes. Checked again at the end, still no leaks.

There is also a very noticeable *lack* of gasoline
smell in the engine compartment, too. It makes me
wonder how long this has been going on, and what kind
of damage that raw fuel has done to my motor...

Tomorrow it gets an oil-change, and I'll be looking
for any tell-tale metal shavings...wish me luck!
