Subject: Fw: [T2] Re: [VB] Kombi

15 would be quite squishy indeed.
I know VW did make 11 seaters for the UK market for some tax laws (in bay window kombi's). They started with a std 9 seater and added two small seats attached to the bulk heads behind the front row of seats and the seats faced into the centre of the bus (sideways not forward). Meant not much leg room for the middle row seat.
I'd imagine they must have three rows in the back??
It would also exceed the load limit of the van if they were all adults!
As for the reverse gear, it must be interpreted wrong?? Can be interpreted as a synchronised Trans with 5 speeds (not all synchronised)?
Regards,
Richard
