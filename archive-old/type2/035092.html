Subject: Standards of reliability

I've changed the subject heading because I want to change the subject a 
little. 

I am getting p-mails, and some list traffic, from people who have 
reliable daily-drivers in which they have invested less than $2000. I do 
not deny that this happens and that this can be done.

But I do want to address something -- an attitude, an ethic -- the pops 
up frequently in these posts, most recently in Stephen White's:

&gt;without being stranded yet... I'm sure I'll have my day, but thats part of
&gt;the adventure.

Okay, sure. That's part of YOUR adventure. You didn't mention whether you 
share this adventure with any one else.

My experience, and that of many on this list including Jay, who started 
this thread, is that significant others, spouses, and children don't 
necessarily see being stranded as an adventure. Neither do employers and 
co-workers who have to take up the slack. Neither do students if you are 
a teacher or teachers if you are a student. Clients don't share the 
adventure. Other motorists on the road don't share the adventure.

This probably sounds like I am gearing up for a lecture about the golden 
rule, and about keeping one's own narcistic pleasures in their proper 
place. But I am not.

Instead, I want to state one simple, true, and undeniable point, which is 
this.

With proper maintenance, preventative maintenance, and attention to 
detail, a Volkswagen bus can be the most reliable vehicle on the road 
today. This costs some money, but surprisingly little compared to what it 
costs to keep Lexuses and Fords and Volvos reliable.

Sadly, however, there is an ingrained belief -- almost a faith -- that 
breaking down in a bus is a certainty. If not today, then next week. Or 
next year. I don't know where this comes from; maybe it is a 
characteristic of bus owners. Maybe it is because VWs, alone of all the 
vehicles on the road, have a stoner-style &quot;idiot book&quot; that is sold in 
virtually every bookstore.

What I want to argue is that this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. And 
when the prophecy is fulfilled, it seems a necessity. And then many of us 
go one step further and make a virtue of the necessity.

And it is all wrong.

I believe -- though I remain open-minded and will listen to argument -- I 
believe that there is not a single piece, part, subsystem, or system in a 
bus that is so flaky that its failure cannot be foreseen and prevented.
Although I talk like I believe in karma, and at some level I do, I am at 
my core a thorough-going modern rationalist. There is no ghost in these 
machines. Just Newton's laws at work on materials that are well understood.

And there is lots of knowledge about buses, their strengths, and their 
failures. Knowledge that comes from experience.

Get it apply it. If you have arranged your life so that you can bring a 
burned out bus back from the dead for less than $2000, that is 
commendable and impressive. But it does nothing to help Jay, who has 
responsibilities and who has a spouse that is saying, look: we need a 
running vehicle RFN (right freakin' now).

It is to Jay that I say: here are some facts. Buses can be made dead-on 
reliable, but not for free and _probably_ not for very cheap. 

And armed with this information, Jay can go to his spouse and make a case 
for keeping the bus or not.

I hope he does. Nothing makes me sadder than to read of one of our type 2 
brothers and sisters who &quot;has&quot; to give up his or her bus.
