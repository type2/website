Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Thermostat- to fit or not to fit?


More important than flaps is the bottom cooling tin that assures an even
flow of air over the cylinders.

Having flaps brings the engine to full operating temperature sooner. This is
useful when the bus is used for short trips, say 20 minutes or less, but if
you are using your bus for longer trips.it probably doesn't make much
difference.

Also, the absence of flaps should have very little if any effect on the
bus's cabin heating system as this is controlled by air passing through heat
exchangers and drawing heat from hot exhaust pipes, not the temperature of
the engine.

In warm weather I feel perfectly comfortable not having flaps. In cold
weather I let the engine warm up for several minutes before driving.

All that having been said I still plan on installing them next time I have
the engine out. But if you don't have them yet don't panic. But do make sure
you have the bottom tin.

&gt; Cute anecdote.  In my personal experience, I had a 1600DP rebuilt where
they
&gt; of course chose to leave out the flaps and thermostat.  The way I
discovered
&gt; that this had happened, was by the condition of my motor oil.  It became
&gt; very sludgey and foamy inside the oil filler tube.  Subsequent research
told
&gt; me that this was condensation that was not being 'flash' heated out of the
&gt; crankcase.  I'm not too sure what the eventual issues would be if left in
&gt; this condition, as I pulled my engine and added the cooling parts, but I
&gt; doubt that foamy oil does good things in your cooling system.
