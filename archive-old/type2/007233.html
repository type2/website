&gt; The socket on your dash is a 12v outlet.  The corresponding plug is
&gt; availiable at bmw motorcycle dealers, as they use it for electric vests. 
&gt; I have heard that outlet was used for a compressor for a space saver

and sold it very quickly.  included was a small spare that fit under

all original.  am i right or crazy?

Subject: got the rat by the tail (65 westy)

I FIGURED IT OUT!   

it wasn't the bad tie rod that stopped the bus being driven, it was the
messed up shifter!   I wanted to move it out of the garage to use the space
for something else, so i got a friend to help me reattach the shift stick.
  but noooo.  the piece underneath was broken, no can do.   so i had to climb
underneath to shift it into reverse to back it out.  to pull it in again
later i had to manually push the rod into first.   joy.    but it starts
right up.  a little messing with the carb helped,  and im going to put a
mechanical advance distributor on it.
         gotta finish the brakes next week, but in the meantime she's on
hold.

I guess I need a rear bumper tent pole bracket too, so any kind souls with a
spare, please let me know.

Subject: Re: 74 rough running problem found!

David,

How do I wire the cylinders against the case?  Does this require special
tools?  Or is it just regular wire?

I am inclined to believe that the heads are shot-the motor is original and
has 163.000 miles.  I am going to pull the valve covers first, because the
mechanics said the exhaust valve seat is visibly dropped-they can see it
with the covers off.  I also trust these guys, particulary because when I
told them I wanted to do the work myself to save money, they agreed and
said that they would do the same.  They are a couple of Czech guys that
probably have been working on aircooleds for 30 years.

I'm sure I'll have tons more questions as the moment of truth arrives. I'm
getting the heads from AVP.

In addition to the various other suggestions that have been made, when
I had this sort of leak recently, it turned out that the O-ring that
goes onto the distributor shaft had gotten old, hard, and cracked.
This isn't something that's easy to see without removing the
distributor, since it's about an inch down into the engine.  One
symptom is that you end up with oil all around the distributor,
including (in extreme cases) on the fuel pump mounting block.

Subject: Bumming...

Yesterday while driving back from an interview (with a VW 
dealer, no less) the Temp light started flashing then the needle 
pegged... limped a mile or so down the road to the next exit and pulled 
off... as I pulled into a BK parking lot several Good Samaritans pulled 
in behind me, jumping out with extinguishers at the ready...Van looked 
like old Faithful....Steam plume 'bout 30 feet high...

        called for a flatbed tow and 45 minutes later The Beast and I 
are sitting in the drive...

        Question is: could a stuck thermostat have caused the head 
gasket to blow...?

        I had done the Head gaskets and had a tiny crack welded on both 
heads back just after Christmas ('bout 10K ago) and she has been running 
 just fine...not a drop...then 'bout two weeks ago I noticed when I got 
back from some errands that she had burped up 'bout a cup of coolant 
after I had stopped and gone inside...nothing since and couldn't even 
find where it had come from... the last coupla weeks have been quite hot 
and humid (90s and 80-90% humidity, too hot for New England)...

&gt; 
&gt; It can also be caused by an air leak near the exhaust port... cold air

&gt; 

Or from what I understand, fresh air from the leak (which could be 
almost anywhere in the exhaust system) mixes with unburned fuel and 
hot gasses and KABOOM!!  There is a richer mixture going through the 
engine when you decelerate which leads to more unburned fuel exiting 
the cylinders.

 Several people responded about the FireHazard in late type 2's I forwarded

  The JunkYard seems to be a parts source that included the Hazard story
(the loose brass tube in non FI fuel pumps) &amp; (the gas tank/filler pipe
rubber connection)- a bus burned up because of the latter
   In an earlier post I mentioned the cracking of this connector, and using
silicone to glop all over it.  Another poster mentioned a replacement
radiator hose piece from auto supply place will work, but I question if
such rubber is gas resistant?  The dealer wants $90 for a 4&quot; long piece of
hose!. Bus Boys, you said this could be fabricated??

You're right.  Only the '74 and '75 Westfalias had an interior 
layout that did not provide interior space for a full-sized spare.  
Instead, they came with a collapsable mini-spare.  A cigarette 
lighter powered compressor was an available option.  A friend of 
mine bought such a compressor from Vanagon list member Martin 
Barrett, who saved it when he sold his '74 Westy.  It is made by 
Coleman and carries both the VW and Coleman logos.

Subject: What's the deal with naval jelly???

I need to replace the window in the cargo door of my 78 bus.
I popped the broken window out, and discovered lot of rust under
the seal.  I undertake my first rust repair on a bus...

I used my drill with a kind of grinding/sanding disc thing and a wire
brush to clean up most of the rust on the ledge, then I applied naval
jelly in hopes of getting the last little bits of rust out of the pits
in the metal.  The directions say to leave the naval jelly for 10
minutes, and a second application may be needed for heavy rust.

After several reapplications, the longest one lasting about 1-1/2
hours, and modified to include intermittant scrubbing with a
toothbrush, it looks like there is still rust in most of the places
where there was rust before.

What's the deal with this stuff?  Does it work?  Am I doing something
wrong?  Is it intended for use on only the lightest of surface rust?
Is there anything that works better?

Any advice for rust removal welcome!

How important are these two bolts?  I figure most of the &quot;staying

Subject: RE: Piece of metal rod stuck in rubber bushing, how remove?

On Vanagon sway bar links, what looks like a rubber bushing on the control
arm is actually two rubber bushings, one above, one below a flat place on
the control arm.  The hole in the flat place is the diameter of the metal
sleeve the link goes through (about 1/2&quot;) not the diameter of the bushing
(about 1.5&quot;).  What's holding the broken piece in is that the broken piece
is rusted to the sleeve and the sleeve is rusted to the hole in the control
arm.   Tear the two rubber bushings off and this will be clearer.  Heat
and a hammer will then get the sleeve out of the control arm.

When I put it back together, I left out the sleeve since it seems to me to
have rusting to the control arm as its sole purpose.  I just put fender
washers above the top bushing and below the bottom bushing to make sure
they stayed there.

If you are able to get the broken piece out, leaving the sleeve rusted in
place on the control arm, do not slide a new link into it.  The link needs
to be able to rock a little in the control arm and will break right away
if the sleeve is rusted in place.  As jag_at_cs has found, this rusted connec-
tion is very robust, and can snap $68 links within the first trip after
installation.

Hope this is clear enough for those that have become intimate with their
Vgon front suspensions.  Feel free to email questions if not.

&gt; &gt; The socket on your dash is a 12v outlet.  The corresponding plug is

&gt; &gt; at bmw motorcycle dealers, as they use it for electric vests.
&gt; 
&gt; Electric vests?  Like battery powered socks?
&gt; My fiance would be VERY interested in that!

I've already thought about that.  Whin I was in my pre-syncre days, I
found elkectric socks at the Fleet Farm (large farm type wal mart) They
ran on 9v, But I'm sure they could be adapted to run on 12v through the
plug

Subject: Re: Any advice on cleaning Westy curtains?

To redye the curtains try a local arts supply store and see if they
have an aniline dye the color you want. I remember using this type
of dye in a batik class years ago. It is very strong and it dyed
every type of fabric in the class. I think it would work on the 
curtains as well.

Well go to a hobby shop or an arts store.  There is dye especially for this (I 
think the stuff we used was a powder alled Procon MX or something like that).  
Check out my web page to see how it turns out.  You need soda ash, salt, urea, 
and some smelly stuff I can't remember.  It's more work than I thought it would 
be. It can only be used on 100% cotton.  If you use it on a mixed fabric only 
the cotton part will dye well.  But it is permanent.  We have washed our duvet 
cover and pillowcases several times and they do not fade.

Reply to message from boleyn_at_scr.siemens_dot_com of Thu, 18 Jul

&gt;What's the deal with this stuff?  Does it work?  Am I doing something
&gt;wrong?  Is it intended for use on only the lightest of surface rust?
&gt;Is there anything that works better?
&gt;
&gt;Any advice for rust removal welcome!
&gt;Rodney

We have used Permatext Extends on many vehicles, including the Westy
with great results. Grind off the surface rust then spray on the 
Extends. It causes a chemical reaction that changes the rust. You end
up with a black hard surface on the bare metal. Doesn't seem to 
affect the paint either.

Subject: '70 bus windows and seat-FREE!

Hey now,
     As some of you know from the trip reports, I converted my bus to westy
when in Los Angeles. So, the side windows, ventwings, and the rear passenger
seat are all at my grandfather's house in Palos Verdes (LA area, south bay
actually), and are free for the taking. The seat is in very good condition,
with only one very small tear, and the windows are all good. So if you want
them, give Sparky (grandpop) a call at 377-1260 and arrange a time to pick
them up. Enjoy!
Peace,
Eddie

Subject: Trip Report: The Redwoods

Hey now,
     It's 10:30 AM 17 July, we're at the Riverwoods campground, about 40
miles south of Crecsent City. It's a nice little campground/RV site set on
the Klamath river, just outside of the Redwoods National Park. The price was
right, only $10, no pet charge, and showers are included. Much better deal
than the $16 NPS sites, which were full anyway.
     Yesterday we finished off the northern stretch of PCH, stopping in Fort
Bragg at Safeway for some supplies at more reasonable prices, and continuing
up to this area. PCH was a wonderfully scenic route, but it was nice to get
to the 101 and not deal with hairpin turns anymore. 
     While looking for ampsites, we found the perfect place. Gold Rush Beach,
I believe was the name. It's about 3 miles north of Orick on 101, and you
turn off the 101 onto a winding dirt road. 4 miles later you emerge at the
beach, and the campground is on the beach. We saw 3 bull elk on the way, no
more than 10 feet from us. Big suckers. Glad they don't mind VW busses in
thier territory, I'd hate to get one of them mad at me...  Problem was, it
was packed solid. 25 or so spaces, every last one occupied-on a Tuesday no
less. I can see why, it's a remarkably scenic area. Problem was, we had no
more film, so we didn't get any elk pictures. I suppose we'll see more of 'em
in Canada.
     Today we will leave the Golden State. It will be a sad occasion, as we
likely will not be back for a year or two. We both miss our home state
already, but adventure lies ahead, so onward we will go. 
     The weather here is marvelous. It's overcast all morning, and it stays
very comfortable all the time, much better than the heat of Texas. I think
yesterday it got to about 65 in the afternoon, just perfect. We both enjoyed
the PCH run, and will likely settle down somewhere up there when we leave
Texas. 
     After about 1 hour of driving we will cross the Oregon border, and
continue on 101 north. Our trusty &quot;California Camping&quot; by Tom Sienstra
(highly reccomended-packed with little known sites and vital information, and
*very* accurate) will no longer be able to guide us, so we will likely spend
some time trying to find a campsite in Oregon. Perhaps around Gold Beach, as
I would like to take the mailboat ride up the Rouge river. We shall see.
     It's starting to rain lightly so I must stash the Powerbook. Our good
wishes to all who remain at home, and we look forward to meeting everyone in
several days time up at Tobin's house in Vancouver. Northward Ho!!!
Peace,
Eddie
