Subject: 6 volt emergency flashers

I'm having 6-volt emergency flasher problems. My turn signals work
intermittently. I can temporarily fix the problem by turning on my emergency
flashers and then checking to make sure both turn signals work. It's pretty
clear that the problem is a bad set of contacts in the emergency flasher unit.

The part number on the emergency flasher unit is:

 #211 953 191

I haven't found any references that show this part number.  The unit has
five electrical connection points and works with a separate two prong turn
signal flasher.

Does anyone have a replacement number for a five prong, 6-volt, emergency
flasher?  Has anyone tried to open one of these up and clean the internal
contact points?
