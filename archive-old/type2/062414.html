Subject: Passed Emmissions...

I finally got my 83 Vanagon Air cooled to pass emmissions with a Weber carb.
The trick was accomplished with smaller main and secondary idle jets and the
installation of a Catalytic converter.  The Carb changes got me part of the way,
but the converter really knocked the numbers down way low...HC at 11ppm and CO
at .06.   I'm still planning to change over from carb to FI.  Thanks to all the
folks on the list who offered suggestions and advice.  I feel like I just
graduated college...    John Jensen in Annapolis
