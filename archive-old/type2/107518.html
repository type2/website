Subject: Re: [T2] Spark Plugs Bosch vs NGK

&gt; One question, Karl. Do they suggest that the plugs be pulled from time to
 time to prevent seizure of the threads, or just wait till 100,000 and break
 the plug off trying to get it out???

During normal services, there is no requirement to touch the plugs. We have not had one seize yet. Some owners
are tight fisted and don't want the plugs replaced at 100,000 miles when they come in for just an oil change
in their ML320 because they don't want to spend the $$$ for the plugs. 12 x $26. So they wait til a major
service, around 115K to 120K miles. The plugs look good still and do not seize.
