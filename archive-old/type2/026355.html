	Although it doesn't have a clock(yet), I believe even on the deluxes
this was an option.  No?

-It's a Deluxe!  Does it have a factory VDO clock?

&gt;
&gt; Although I don't know TOO much about the differences between the classes
of
&gt; bus, I have a '70 that has the anodizes aluminum trim, and the triple
&gt; seating, but is not a walk through.  I have always assumed that my bus was
a
&gt; Deluxe.  I too am curious concerning this matter.  Anyone out there with
the
&gt; answer?  Greatly appreciated...

&gt;
&gt; I have a question regarding a '67 21 Window.  I recently looked at one
that
&gt; has all of the deluxe features, but it is not a walk-thru.  I was under
the
&gt; impression that all of the deluxes WERE walk-thrus.  Can someone explain
&gt; this?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Victor
