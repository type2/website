Appreciate it. I have had ONE problem with these kits, unfortunately to
another Type 2 list member. The holes in the end of one of the bars are not
centered, though I am not sure to what degree (if it can be used as it is,
or not). I'm waiting for instructions on if replacement is required, and of
course, I am ready to do it.

Thanks for the props!
