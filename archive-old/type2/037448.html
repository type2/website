Sorry to have to repost this but I haven't recieved any feedback.  I
have a 74 with an automatic transmission.  I am running a 2L with FI and
want to put in a 79 automatic transmission.  Has anyone done this
conversion?
Also does anyone have a good automatic tranny 74-76?
I am located in MD

Thanks
Frankie
