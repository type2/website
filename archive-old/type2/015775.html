&gt;practice a bit then shoot the paint.   I just don't think it is worth my
&gt;time to do the work on the rust spots when I can get a pro to do it for
&gt;$20.00/hr.

A couple things: you'll care much more about the finished product than he
will, and it's probably cheaper for you to spend the time yourself.  I make
more than $20/hr, and I still do most of my own work because I know it's
not going to cost me in the wallet to spend a couple extra hours on a spot.
 Now if I was taking time off of work to do it, well that's a different
story.
