&gt;Interesting that you should say something about the 30,000 mile service
interval on
&gt;the rears. I've never heard of it. (But there is a lot I've never heard of.)
&gt;Also, in all the hundreds of thousands of miles I've driven them, I've never
&gt;repacked a single one, nor replaced a single rear bearing. They must be
quite up to
&gt;the task!

I agree with Al on this one, it's one of those, would be nice but...  I've had
a '78 with about 175k never done, many vanagons and buses around 150k,
never done.  I know Dolan has had a set of rear bearings sitting in his
basement he meant to put on something like 5 years ago, never done.

Conversely I once looked at a nice '87 camper (back in '94 or so) with 75k
miles where they had recently had to replace a rear bearing set after a long
trip to Alaska.

But until I hear one, I know I'm too lazy to ever repack one.

Al also mentions front end work which is funny, aside for ball joints for
boots,
very little as well I've ever done.  In fact of the last 7-8 buses and vans
I have
yet to ever even have one aligned, and some of those I drive at least 50k
never having the front touched.

YMM REALLY V on this one.
