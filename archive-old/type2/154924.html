Subject: RE: [T2] And now with less power!

Karl,

Yes, I am running a degree pulley on the motor. I use a nice chrome
expensive looking timing gun for timing. I recently checked it against my
neighbors gun and my Sears timing gun and it is dead on. 

Specifically the directions for the SVDA go something like this:

7.5 degrees BTDC at idle, but my motor won't run at that setting. I starts
and idles poorly at 0 degrees TDC and likes 5-7.5 degrees ATDC at idle,
which is close to the factory setting for a '71 DP 1600 motor.

As for throttle advance:

28-30 degrees _at_ 3500 RPM w/o vacuum
38-45 degrees _at_ 3500 RPM w vacuum

I get 28 degrees ATDC with vacuum and without. John Connolly explains that
this is because the rubber in the vacuum can hasn't &quot;broken in&quot; yet. I don't
think I should crank it up to 38-45 degrees ATDC with just mechanical
advance. I want to drive the bus for a while! :) 

I am patient enough to wait for the vacuum can to soften up. It will
probably take a while in this freezing cold we have been having lately.

It is a little confusing and makes me dizzy. (sorry for the pun, but I
couldn't resist)
