Subject: oil temp gauge question

In an effort to make my 1986 Brazilian DC a reliable daily 
driving vehicle. I've decided to add a tach in the clock 
hole, and oil pressure/oil temp/volt meter under the radio 
block off plate. 

I'm starting to map out the installation of these items and 
have done extensive reading in the archieves of the Type2 
list. I discovered many helpful hints reading the 
previously posted materials.

I do have questions about the oil temp sender which will be 
mounded replacing the oil drain plug. Does anyone have 
advice on how to route the connecting wire to the oil drain 
plug sender?

Thanks in advance.
