&gt; The squirrel fan does nothing above idle...

Has anyone considered adding a bilge blower directly to the squirrel cage
fan by removing the fan motor and replacing it with the blower?  The
existing fan bracket would be used to mount the blower/cage.  It would
require a little bit of modification to the cage in order to mount the
blower, but no modification to the bus.  I could probably come up with a
casting to attach the blower to the cage.

I've been tossing around a few ideas about how to install my bilge blower,
and it dawned on me that this would eliminate having to provide a way for
the blower to have a cabin air feed.  It might even allow me to use a
smaller (and less expensive) blower.  I was originally going to install a
blower in the spare tire well, pipe the air through the well wall into the
motor-less squirrel cage housing and then through to the heat exchangers.

Thoughts?  Would it adversely affect the engine's performance?  Any problems
with using engine compartment air for the feed?  (Hmm... would probably want
to duct the blower intake away from the carb.  Not sure how it would be
affected by a FI setup.)  I think it would eliminate the blower melt down
issue, too.
