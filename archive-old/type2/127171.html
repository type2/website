Well, the Permatex silver stuff I use is supposed to be good for exhaust
studs so it is fairly &quot;high temp&quot;  I don't use very much, since any that
escapes from the drum/hub interface will be thrown onto the drum, which
isn't good for man nor beast!

The other thing I found is that it is a lot easier to remove the drums if
you take them off every time you have the wheel off.  You need to check
the brake shoes anyway and it's a lot easier to do it with the drum off
then through the little slots on the back side of the brake.  My bus never
had the retaining screws, and doesn't seem to miss them.
