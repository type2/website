Subject: BAP Heads?

I installed new DP heads from BAP last year. Ever since then I've had
problems with my exhaust valve clearance tightening up after several hundred
miles. This valve problem was the last straw and I decided to have the
engine rebuilt (at 80K). This week I learned that the reason the valves were
tighten up was that the seats were not right for unleaded fuel.

I'm a little pissed since it's well passed the warrantee but in fact they
were never right. I wonder if anyone else is having this problem or if I'm
the only fool that buys heads from BAP.
