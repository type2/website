Well, the time is almost here for my trip to Fort Jackson for my Advance
NCO Course.  ANCOC for those who have been around the Army.  I was to
have done this in January but with the death of my step-father, it was
delayed.  Temperature wise I would have like to have gone then, however,
that was not to be.

So, I will be unsubscribing for a while starting 13 August which is also
the date I leave for SC, to return around 5 October.  I plan on stopping
in Indianapolis, IN then, maybe, making a stop at Camp Lejeune, NC to see
what changed there since I left the USMC twenty years ago this month.

If any of you between MN andSC see a gold '87 Vanagon GL Syncro with
Minnesota plates and the old list sticker, wave, it's probably me.

Wish me luck!  If I don't pass the PT test on the first day this will be
a VERY short trip!SFC Brad Spear
