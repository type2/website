Subject: wiring questions???

Here's one I hope someone can help me out with.  I have a '63 kombi that was
mostly complete when I got it.  However a few things were missing, one of
which was the starter.  I'll be buying a new one this weekend and just need
to figure out where the wires hook up to it.  When I look at the space where
it goes, there's a small box mounted above where the starter goes with three
wires coming out of it.  Two are black and one is red.  one of the black ones
has a push on connector and the other black wire and the red one have the
round type connectors that go over a bolt.  Basically, I'd just like to know
what the box is and where the three wires hook up.  If no one knows, I'm sure
I can figure it out, but I thought it would be easier to ask.  Also, where
does the positive wire from the battery go- to the starter or the solenoid?
 Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks
Sean Stueber
