     I've been reading my Bentley's here, and it sure looks like you
guys are right about the '69 not having any tranny support at the rear.
Which makes me wonder why mine never fell down with no support after I
pulled the engine. Do you suppose the shift linkage at the nose was
supporting it? That's the only thing I can figure. Gee -- not cool, not
cool at all. Well, when I go up to my place in MN next summer I'll have
to take a peak under the old girl and see what's up. She's been sitting
there for over 14 years I guess with the engine out and no tranny
support.
