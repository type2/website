Subject: Re: [T2] 71 gas door questions

Hiya Austin,

Went through all this with the Duck a couple of years ago.

The lock on your gas flap was added by a PO.

The hole is a drain.  For rainwater and gas overflow.  It leads down and 
through the frame.  If you crawl under the Bus and closely inspect the bottom of 
the frame you'll see the hole.  Mine (as yours probably is) was plugged up.  
Dirt and 25 years of crud.  It was really a struggle to get that thing cleaned 
out.
