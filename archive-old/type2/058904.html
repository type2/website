You may want to check your dwell and timing.  That rattle may be preignition.  I resisted buying a timing gun/dwell meter for years.  I bit the bullet and I have to say that it was the single-best investment I've made for maintaining our vehicles.

My '80 was running hot and lacked decent power until I adjusted dwell and timing.  An added bonus is that my gas mileage also improved.  It is not hard to do, especially with Sean Bartnik's detailed summary (see type2 site).  The only problem I had was finding the timing notch on the pulley; it is found on the engine side, so you have to feel for it and mark it where the gun can hit it.

I hope this helps,

John Haddad
