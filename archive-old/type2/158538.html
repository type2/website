Subject: Re: [T2] No pulse at injector in '77 EFI

Hi Robert,

&quot;Starts-and-dies-right-away&quot; is a typical symptom of a large vacuum  
leak. Double-check EVERY connection and you should find success.

If not that then it might be that the flap in the afm is not engaging  
the fuel pump. To test this, disconnect the AFM from the S-pipe and  
turn the ignition to run, but don't start the bus. Now move the flap  
inside the AFM and listen for the fuel pump. If you don't hear it  
start whirring, you need to remove the cap from the AFM and  
straighten the contact wires that normally power the fuel pump when  
the bus is running.


Happy trails,

&gt; Hi guys,
&gt;
&gt; I recently became the owner of a '77 Westy that was rebuilt, but  
&gt; the re-builder died before he could finish the job.  The engine is  
&gt; in the bus and cranks, and all double-relay readings are correct,  
&gt; the engine sometimes runs momentarily (probably due to cold-start  
&gt; injector doing it's job) but the engine doesn't continue to run  
&gt; longer than the initial burst. There is fresh fuel and a spark and  
&gt; the timing seems to be correct according to a timing light check.  
&gt; No smell of fuel from the exhaust.
