The Vanagon is probably heavier than the baywindows, but I doubt that is why it is so slow.  If I were you I would take it to a chassis dyno and have the hp and torque measured.  Make sure they have a wideband O2 sensor so you can also check your A/F ratio.  This will cost under $100 and should help answer your questions.  I bet you are running way rich which would kill your power and mileage as you describe.  I also have my suspicions that the cam in the Vanagon 2-liter is a conservative grind although I have nothing to back that up.

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;     This maybe long but I have to get some help here.  I bought my first
&gt;Vanagon Westy in October I think.  It is a stock 82 FI 2.0l westy camper.
&gt;It is very underpowered in my opinion.  All I have ever had was 71-79 buses.
&gt;My last three were 79 station wagon, 76 Westy &amp; a 79 camper conversion.  I
&gt;know how these things are supposed to run.  My Vanagon is a different story.
&gt;I am floored most of the time just to do 60-65.  I am getting only about
&gt;14MPG.  Freeway on ramps make me downshift to 3rd.  I also have a unsteady
&gt;idle of about 200RPM while at idle.  sometimes when I downshift for a corner
&gt;to 2nd &amp; give it gas, there is a hesitation.  The car just goes flat for a
&gt;second or two.
