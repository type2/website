Subject: tapping sound

So I start my bus up and i notice this tapping sound coming from the rear. I 
give it some more gas and it hesitates. Then i keep giving it gas and it 
smoothes out (takes a couple of seconds and a bit of gas), but the tapping 
sound is much louder at the higher rev. Loose valves and Timing off??? Am I 
right? Also, a 72 bus has an alternator of a generator?? And while Im on the 
subject, Whats the difference between the two? Alright, thats it for now. 
Thanks
