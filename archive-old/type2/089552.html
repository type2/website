Subject: Re: [T2] Camper and Commercial #7

Gee..with the talk of the mags i went to their sites.  Like what i saw 
and have subscribed to Volksworld as well as camper and commercial.  BTW 
my HotVW and VWTrends just expired and will probably stay that way as 
they rarely have anything bus in them.
