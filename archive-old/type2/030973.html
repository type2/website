&gt; What kinda gauges do you  fellers reccomend.  I hope to find some unity
&gt; here, but I excpect I'll get a list.

unity, nahhhh

but I have oil temp, oil presure, ampmeter (which is not worth the trouble
and will be replaced by ???   maybe voltmeter or even tach)

&gt; BTW my '71 seems to do o.k. on plain old 30w, I've considered synthetic but
&gt; have heard if you have a leak somewhere it'll find it for you, so I figger

not quite that bad, but if there is a leak it will.
