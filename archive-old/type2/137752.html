Subject: Re: [T2] Fresh air fan? Vanagon upgrade for late bay??

That fan on the Vanagon serves the same purpose as the auxillary fan
on the late bus which is mounted hanging from the engine compartment
roof.

 I was helping a friend install a vanagon engine the other weekend and
 noticed how VW attached the fresh air fan to the alternator.  Has anyone
 figured out a way to use this on a late bay with a pancake engine?  This
 would blow air much stronger than the engine fan.
 
 Any thoughts? Pros/cons?
