&gt;With reference to the vacuum can replacement, is it possible to replace just 
&gt;the vacuum can on the original dual-advance distributors (74 with dual 
&gt;Solex)? If so, where could one be found?

It's easy to remove. Karl taught me that on the arm of the can is an ID number. I would try aircooled_dot_net for a new one. They claimed to have a bunch when I last contacted them but will need a part number for an exact match.
