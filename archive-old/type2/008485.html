&gt; need help!  how 2 remove seat back from seat section on drivers seat
&gt; of 71 westy. In process of reupholstering and have 2 pivet points that
&gt; look like very large rivet head on the outer sides and a cup on the
&gt; inner side. thank you much from virginia

That's because they _are_ large rivet heads!  I ended up drilling mine
out and replacing them with fine thread bolts from the local hardware
store.  Nylock nuts allow them to remain loose enough to pivot without
coming completely loose.
