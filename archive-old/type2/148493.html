&gt; FWIW, most of the &quot;green&quot; production - i.e. stuff made
&gt;to have limited impact on the environment - is either coming
&gt;from or will come from China...Seems the Chinese aren't copy-
&gt;ing &quot;everything&quot; we've done here... ;-(

Not so, Tony!  Chinese industry has some of the worst environmental
practices and are predicted to only become worse. Developing nations
for the most part have poorer environmental practices because they are
mostly interested in developing economically and not in being &quot;green&quot;.
Environmentally sound practices are primarily the realm of nations
with a strong enough economy to support so called &quot;green&quot; industrial
practices.

Bus content? Re-using older vehicles, keeping them in good tune and
using them for a dedicated purpose is environmentally sound. Just look
at Cuba (Venceremos!)

I live in a restored old (1912) home and bike to work until the roads
ice over. But then again I'm an aging boomer who can afford such
extravagances.
