&gt;Don't trade your stock Solex's for the single progressive.  The Weber is a poor
&gt;carb for the bus. 

Hogwash! If you don't beleive me then send me the carbs, manifolds, oil bath
etc and I will toss my weber and test this setup for you free of charge:)&gt;

In all seriousness, try finding a pair of stock carbs from a junked bus and
have those rebuilt so can still tool around while you wait. Word on the
street is that Rimco does a good job of remachining the stock duals. I have
the Weber and it works OK but I really want to know what the stock setup
feels like from the drivers seat. 

Keep us posted
