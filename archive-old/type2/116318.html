Subject: Fuel Venthilation???

Hey guys....

	With all this talk about the fuel vent system... can someone help me
explain exactly how it works? Does the fuel travel through those vent tubes
that run in the engine compartment vents?

I've NEVER checked those tubs, and if they're anything like the rest of the
car, all those tube pieces are probably original. Do only gas FUMES travel
past there, or actual fuel?


If that's the case.. pardon me for a second if I try to re-invent the
process. Would it be a BAD idea to completely get rid of all of that stuff..
and... say... I take one port off the fuel tank, and attach a charcoal
canister to it, and the other part of the canister I attach to a port on the
carburetor? Kind of like how the slightly newer cars are?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but... my current 73 Bus with the 1.8 does not have
a charcoal canister. Either it did and the previous owner removed it, or it
never came one.

I know I should check my Bently manual (which I did buy by the way) but I
ABSOLUTELY DETEST using manuals.. I hate them. I use them only for torque
specs...
