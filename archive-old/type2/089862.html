Subject: not technical ...

this isnt a technical question, but more of a fun one, i was just curious of 
everyones favorite movie which shows the coolest, or most busses? i recently 
caught an old robert redford movie in which he is a down hill snow skier for 
the us team, wow , an amazing amount of busses in the background throughout 
the whole movie... hope to hear everyone elses... 
peace... scott  71 vesty
