Yes, My 79 bus is 1&quot; wider then all the other &quot;inferior&quot; baywindow buses :)

The way the VW factory made the 79 bus 1&quot; wider is quite interesting:

Instead of having the rear view mirrors on the doors with the longer dimension
of the mirror in the vertical plane, VW turned the mirrors 90 degrees, so that
the longer dimension is on the horizontal(sic) plane. I forget where I read
this, but it's another example of the useless info I remember.

So, if you want to make your baywindow bus an inch wider, just turn your
mirrors 90 degrees :D

PS. I've made my bus as narrow as the rest of the bays, by returning the
mirrors to the &quot;standard&quot; position (even tho' it didn't came that way from the
factory).
