&gt; You can slide a deep-well 14mm socket down over the top of the distributor

&gt; &gt; I currently have 3 vehicles with the Pertronix operating in them.  On each
&gt; &gt; and every one, it has been a B*#*h to get the magnetic circular thingy to
&gt; &gt; fully seat on the distributor drive.  Makes sure it is fully seated and

don't forget on many VW distributors one lobe is slightly different than
the other 3 and the magnet takes this into account, it took me three tries
to find the right position, it is next to impossible to see, but when I
hit the right alignment it slide right on with no hassle.
