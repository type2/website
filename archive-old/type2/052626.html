 &gt;The movie&quot;Almost Famous&quot; has the most VWs that I have ever seen in a 
movie, many buses.
 &gt;The movie streets Tuesday 3/13. PS. The movie is pretty good too.

Discerning bus fanatics can see trailers of this movie
if you clickety-click right here:http://us.imdb_dot_com/Trailers?0181875

The reviews were not that good, but it should be worthy of a rental, if 
only to see the busses.
Those of us who lived through those days wish that they were as fun as 
Hollywood portrays them now...
