Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator, rebuilt, high output, lifetime fact

&gt; On of the things that I'm very pleased that I did when I restored my 1970
&gt; Westy was to install not only an 80-amp deep cycle auxiliary battery (under
&gt; the jump seat behind the driver's seat) but also a 1.5-amp trickle charger
&gt; that is wired to the 120 outside shore power.

In the winter I kept my trickle-charger connected to my battery and would hook
up an extension cord at night. Should really be necessary in Tennessee...

&gt; That said, there should be no reason for the problems you are having,
&gt; considering all that you have done unless there is a leak somewhere in your
&gt; wiring.  If it is holding a charge overnight but discharging on short trips
&gt; around town I would look at things that are drawing power when the ignition
&gt; is on.

I'm pretty certain my radio is drawing power. It's not wired into the
ignition. But I wouldn't think the radio memory would really drain that much.
But that problem will be releived when I wire in the aux battery. I'll run all
accessories off the aux.

&gt; What kind of bus do you have, BTW?  I guess I'm jumping in sort of in the
&gt; middle of this thread.

'74 Campmobile (hard top). 1700 pancake. Weber progressive carb.

-Eric
