Edmund and Mom,

It was this time last year that I was licking my wounds from my rounds with
the city.  A couple of things that can extend your time with the city.
1. appeal the decision. - this should extend your time and get you an
administrative hearing.  This will buy you some time while they arrange the
hearing.
2. At the administrative hearing, ask for additional time to make
arrangements to get it worked on and operational.  As long as you are making
a good faith attempt to get it running again, the city seems to be willing to
work with you as long as you are trying to get it on the road and extend
time.

All the bus needs do do is drive forward and backward under its own power.
Not even elegantly.  If it can do it under the power of two cylinders, they
have to leave you alone.  I got my original notice just after april fools and
was able to delay and postpone while I was working on the truck until mid
august when I got the transmission in. The city then came out and watched me
back out and drive back in.  That was it and they have been off my back
since.

It it interesting that you bring this up at this point.  The &quot;it will do in a
pinch&quot; transmission that I threw in there to get the city off of my back,
broke down two weeks ago.  When I pull it out, I will park the truck
backwards up against the garage and cover it so that no one can easily tell
that it is non-op.


Good Luck,

Scott

&gt;  Bloody nosy neighbors... My Mom is in San Diego, [...] as of the 23rd she

&gt; what the law says will happen if it gets towed.
&gt;
&gt;      So, does anybody have any ideas on how to deal with it? Advice on
&gt; past encounters with the local city hall? One option would be to put it
&gt; in her garage. Problem is, it won't fit as is, so she'd need to pull off
&gt; the garage door to get it in. Which would obviously be problematic for a
&gt; single woman...
