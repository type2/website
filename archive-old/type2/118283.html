&gt; well went out and tightened all the terminals and connectors and
&gt; took test drive, starteed out acting the same but then smoootheed
&gt; out and ran normally.

&gt; this morning went out and drove a few miles and it acted like one
&gt; cyl was not fireing intermitently no sound or other symptoms.

&gt; really got me mystified, as soon as it cools off I will go out and
&gt; pull a plug or two see if they are wearing or over carboned.

&gt; any other suggestions

Did you say you had replaced the plug wires?

Cap and rotor?

Condensor?
