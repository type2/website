Subject: RE: Who has a full flowed upright engine on their bus?

I have a full flow system in my 71. Ill describe what I have:

1) Out of the pump goes either the straight connection or a 45 degrees 
connection. I use a 45 degrees connection and turned it until it pointed a 
little down and a little forward. I still had to dimple in the rear of the 
tin forward of the pully. I only had to dent it a little to get it to fit. 
Dent it too much and it rubs on the pully and drives you crazy. For that 
reason some people cut a little hole in it for clearance. Not really enough 
to leak air, but I was lazy and hit it with a hammer.

2) The 90 degree fitting goes on the return fitting on the left. I also had 
to bonk the tin to make it fit. You can bonk a little more here, not as 
much danger of rubbing on the pully.

I don't like to use pipe dope or teflon tape when tapping into the aluminum 
or alloy block. Too easy to turn it too far and crack the fittings. Into 
the steel pump cover you can use teflon tape, but I didn't. I used a little 
Locktite green on both and it has been fine.

Here is my tip of the day: For all four brass fittings I noticed on mine 
that there was a significant internal restriction at the center, about 4 mm 
reduction in diameter. I guess that is done for strength of wrenching. I 
found the largest drill bit I could put into the end of the fitting (out 
where it is larger, near the threaded end) and drilled out the restriction. 
That made a much smoother path through the fitting. I doubt it helped all 
that much, but I feel better about it, and that is what counts...

Where are you hanging your filter? I put mine on the left under the 
&quot;battery tray&quot; area. I mounted the filter horizontally with a backing plate 
on the top made from some spare steel bracket. It is strong, I can drain 
the filter and it is mostly out of the way. The hose length is nice and 
short, too. When I put mud flaps on the rear it will even stay clean, too.

Do you want pictures?

&gt;I finally took delivery of my newly built, full flowed, single port doghouse
&gt;cooler 1776 for my 70 Bus today. I'm wondering if anyone can tell me how
&gt;they handled the barbed oil hose fitting that sticks out of the rear of the
&gt;engine block. I have 2 possible fittings, one is straight and the other is
&gt;90 degrees, and either of them interfere with the rear engine tin(the one
&gt;that goes around the pulley). The only way I can see is to cut a big hole in
&gt;the tin. What have other people done here? Also, do you teflon tape the
&gt;fitting into the block, or did I read somewhere that Berg recommends putting
&gt;it in metal to metal?
