The main reason I like my 69' Rivera over the Westie (had a 69') is simplicity
and the Rivera suits my camping style.  I have never used a sink in a Westie
or a Rivera for that matter.  My 69' came with just a water tank and a spigot.
I like the extra counter space this provides and it makes doing dishes a sorta
outside of the bus chore.  I like the full length zippered windows in the top.
These let in lots of light and plenty of air.  I'd never thought I'd be a fan
of vinyl.  But the vinyl top of the Rivera is so much easier to clean than the
Westie canvas.  As for storage, both buses are about the same.  Though Westie
does have the lift up rear seat and prop, which I dearly miss.  Rivera and
Westie borrowed several ideas from each other.  My 69' Rivera has the tray or
shelf over the bed, whereas the Westie had the ever elusive cargo net.  The
next year Westies had the shelf.  
    Another about the Riveras was their White Stag side tents.  These are so
much easier and quicker to set up than the Westies.  This may not matter a lot
to some folks.  But on a 5 day trip last summer my tent was put up and taken
down everyday &lt;sometimes even in the dark!&gt;  
    The last thing about my Rivi I like is that it is an Oregon bus, bought
and sold here in Eugene.  I talk the the original owner every now and then and
thank him, Albert, for his foresight and gusto.  In fact I named the bus in
his honor.
    As for which ones better?  It's all a matter of camping style and what you
want in a bus.  The main thing is that they are all Volkswagens.
  Peace, Love, and I never met an (air cooled) VW I didn't like,
