Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] What H4's is everyone using in ther Buses?

A couple of things here that may be of interest--

The site you directed the list to--at the description of e $14.95 H-$
conversion lamps mentions that &quot; be sure your wiring is up to snuff
prior to mounting these lamps&quot;
These have to be the bird watching Packostanley units which I had in my
Van for the total onf two days.
Terrible light pattern---all over except where they are suposed to be
--out in front of you.
AND besides ths minisule candlepower on the road problem--they didn't
fit between the buckets and the retaining ring tight---
I had to make rubber gaskets to take up the slack so they didn't rattle
in the mounts.
Another high quality import product.

Second the advantage of running relays is not only to protect your
wiring and switches when running high wattage stuff--but it's primary
purpose is to give the lamps a full charging system load of juice--much
to the advantage of the lamps, and the driver using them--

Dave,
I'm running the 55/100W bulbs that I picked up from aircooled_dot_net.
They are unbelievably bright, no relays either. Just plugged them in and
turned them on. I use my high beams quite a bit and for extended lengths
of time with no ill effects.
The light pattern is awesome compared to the previous sealed beams.

What brand and wattage are everyone using in the Buses&gt; Are you doing
the Relay routing? I'm getting closer the starting that phase.
