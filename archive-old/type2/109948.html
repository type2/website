&lt;&lt; Have any of you seen these? http://www.ikombi_dot_com  I'm kinda new to all of

&gt;you think it would be worth it?


First, due to DOT regulations, we can't import these to US.  If you are in 
another country, you better check your local regulations before buying. &gt;&gt;

I'm on a couple three other lists and they're full of horror stories of guys
trying to import &quot;grey market&quot; cars into the US...Even Bill Gates had prob-
lems with his Porsche(s)...and he could afford to try. I doubt that even VW
could bring the Kombi up to current specs...IF you went with this scheme,
you might end up with a vehicle sitting on a dock...
