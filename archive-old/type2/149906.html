Subject: Got to get rid of it!

Howdy Fellers and Cowgirls,

I got an &quot;abandoned unlicensed vehicle&quot; ticket yesterday on my 79 parts van.

I have to get rid of this 79 chassis. It is in overall good shape with
minimal rust. The 2nd and 3rd seats are there, the dealer installed overhead
A/C is in good shape and all the glass and large sliding side windows are
intact.

Missing is the tranny, EFI (2.0L long block is still here), and brakes. I
will throw on an older &quot;wide 5&quot; set with beam for transportation/towing.

Some folks have expressed interest, but I haven't heard back. It will go to
the crusher next week.

Let me know ASAP cause this is my second ticket and I think the cop is
pissed and taking it personally.

Make me an offer! Any offer considered since it will cost me 70 bucks to
crush it! Buy it and swap over your rusty stuff. It has a clear Colorado
Title.

I'll email photos if interested

Jon
