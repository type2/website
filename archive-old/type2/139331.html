Subject: Re: [T2] Oil temperature sender conversion?

Considering the reported &quot;hobbyist&quot; accuracy of the VDO gauges doing a diff
across the two locations can't hurt. I'd be interested in seeing any
differences as per the next paragraph I'm writing.

After I though about it a bit it seemed to me that the actual problem with
a temp sender on a Tee at the pressure sender location is more of a bad
idea because the oil in that location is probably going to be pretty static
as it's located at the end of a small tube with no &quot;flow through path&quot;.
There will be a spot near the engine end of the Tee that has the oil sucked
away and replaced by the flow across the opening but the oil at the sender
end of he Tee is more or less just going to &quot;sit there&quot;. The only heat that
oil will pick up after the engine is running will be by direct conduction
from the oil at the end of the tube and any heat transferred from the block
to the Tee. If you use any sort of relocation hose to solve sender
clearance issues I'm certain the temps would be way off (as mentioned for
the Type4).

The wire to the sump plate can be done gracefully. There are tin pieces
only a few inches away on either side that it can be run behind. You just
have to certain to use a GOOD wire with insulation that is temp, petroleum,
and abrasion resistant.

&gt; Running a wire down to the sump plate seems even messier than the dipstick

&gt; gage using the tee setup, leaving the dipstick gage in place and then see 
&gt; how much lower the tee sender reads.
