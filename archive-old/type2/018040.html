&gt;the tranny to remove.  As the engine wouldn't come I just  bolted the
&gt;tranny back in, chained a bar under it and pulled just the engine.  So
&gt;much for my original plans of leaving them together.  
&gt;Question?

good decision to pull the motor. I usually just drop the engine by itself, 
and have gotten used to taking it in and out that way, 
simply because I'm by myself and it's easier to handle the engine alone. I'd 
leave the trans where it is, since you're biggest 
concern is with the left head.
Think through taking off the good head before you do it. This is the head 
with the good compression but bad exhaust studs. 
Do you have a method to hold the loose head while you work on the exhaust 
studs? You might consider draining the oil,
then sitting the motor on a moving blanket or something so the flywheel is 
taking the weight, this way your head is already
vised  for the stud removal job (you may want to remove the push rod tubes on 
that side at a minimum, just so you can 
have better access to the studs.
