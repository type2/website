I ordered a new thermostat from VW heritage the week before last, along with
some door seals to replace the crappy cheap ones that leak.  Before
installing it, I thought it might be a good idea to test it first. So I put
it in a mug with some hot water.  Nothing.  Sent it back and got another
one.  Tested it.  It made no attempt to expand whatsoever.  So I sent that
one back and asked them to test the next one BEFORE sending it out.  The
moral of this story is - if you buy a thermostat, be sure to test it before
it fries your engine.
I got the new seals installed, they fit very well and have all the right
shape mouldings at the corners etc.  I also got a mechanic to replace my
split CV boot, he didn't have time to do the other side, but that's not
split yet, just cracked.
Any listees going to the T2OC camping rally this weekend at Beddgelert?  We
will be there, thermostat or no thermostat.  You can identify Sally by her
dark green hue and registration SEY392T.

PS before you all throw your hands up in horror, I do have a thermostat, it
just doesn't work very well.
