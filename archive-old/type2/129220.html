 &gt; All of these VW's had heater systems that leaked a bit of

Hi Chris
Yep. I removed those heater tubes that connect the engine
to the body off. I then realized air was rushing in at the
front foot wells while driving at highway speeds, etc.
Lower pressures inside the bus were sucking the air in
from the outside open duct ends. So to cap the ducting at
the body I jammed a tennis ball into each duct under
the bus and then made a seal with duct tape :^)  Although
it looks like a crummy job, I took my time and I'm
confident there is a tight seal. Doing that didn't make
an improvement though.

So after that attempt I just removed the main heater
channel that runs under the bus cargo floor. Sealed up
ducting end that was open was made  and the exhaust
still is finding a way inside this poor bus.


 &gt; Also can you move your CO detector and get higher
 &gt; readings near any of the heater outlets?

No I haven't really noticed much of a difference when
the detector is in different locations. Usually it sits
a top the rear mattress bed which is over the engine
compartment. Some of the places i've put it include ,
front passenger seat, on the floor up in front near the
heater foot wells, on the dashboard..

There was never much of a change in readings and the highest
readings were usually when the detector was in the back of
the bus. Probably because the windows are open.

Just to mention though my heater boxes are in great
condition. The right box is from California and the left
is from Colorado.
