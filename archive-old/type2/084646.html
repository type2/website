&gt;Perhaps there is a reason that VW NEVER EVER EVER put a [currently common]
&gt;009 on a typ1, typ3, or typ4 engine?

The best value of an 009 is it only wastes $50 or so to get by until you=20
find a better curved dizzy. This does not include the T-IV motor. It's dead=
=20
wrong and cannot in any way meet specs.

I have verified curves on a number of 009's and have found in the cases=20
where they were not worn they all hit within a degree or two of 25=B0 total=
=20
range. The 009 is shown by Bosch as a suitable replacement for some VW=20
engines, but not the T-IV in any case.

Standard procedure when first installing and running any new or used dizzy=
=20
is verifying the curve with a tack and timing light. Plot the advance/rpm=20
every 500 rpm up to total advance. Compare your curve with stock. If you=20
are within the stock curve min-max area at all rpm's, you can use it and=20
expect suitable function. If not, find a better fit ASAP.
