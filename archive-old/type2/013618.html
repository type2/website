&gt;The consensus is: bad motor mount/s.  Which is upsetting, 'cuz 
&gt;they're brand new

If you jack up a 72-79 bus by the engine (ie. put a floor jack under the engine 
and lift the bus with it), you'll tear your motor mounts in half.  Maybe this 
is what happened?  BTW, motor mounts can be replaced without removing the 
engine.
