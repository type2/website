&gt; If you have verified everything, and I mean everything else, and the motor 
&gt; does not respond to the idle mixture screw with changes in rpm, you have a 
&gt; carb issue, like crud blocking flow of air or fuel in the channels in the 
&gt; body of the carb or jets. Poor response to the idle rpm adjustment screw 
&gt; means first verify that the throttle gap is spec. If it is, suspect vacuum 
&gt; leak somewhere. 

Do you have the idle cut off solenoid?
Check the connections and pull the wires to see if they pull out of the 
connector lugs.
Even if you have a connection but too much resistance from loose &amp; oily wires 
the solenoid will not open correctly causing the idle circuit to malfunction 
and this can be intermittent if the wire is loose.
I just had this issue with my bus.
Replaced the jumper wires and everything was good as new, it made a huge 
difference in drivability.
