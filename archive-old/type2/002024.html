     Yesterday I did my first oil change on my 79 Westy. I drained the oil
and
&gt; removed the oil screen. The screen itself looked pretty clean, but the cap
had
&gt; all sorts of grunge in it. Anyway, I cleaned the screen, cap, gasket , nut
and
&gt; put it all back together ensuring not to over-tighten the nut. Tight and
just a
&gt; little tighter. I also tried to make sure that that gasket was lining up
&gt; properly, and it appeared to be so. Now it is leaking oil from that seal.
My
&gt; question is should I have used some sort of gasket goop on the gasket to
make
&gt; sure that it stayed in place while I was tightening the nut?
&gt;      I most likely don't have the nut tight enough for a proper seal
because I
&gt; was erring on the side of caution. I lack a Torque wrench. My kind
neighbor has
&gt; one and I will borrow it tonight either way. I am wondering if I should
drain
&gt; the oil again and reset the seal?

Yes, definetly!, and I would put  a new gasket set, and a new *Bosch* oil
filter on while your at it.
