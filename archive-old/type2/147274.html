Subject: new heat exchanger

After taking a better look at the right side of the heating system I 
decided to buy a used HE and the tube that runs from the HE to the 
flapper box.  It's really nice having Chris and the bustedbus_dot_com parts 
collection so close by!  He crawled under her and figured out what was 
needed and so on.  Great guy.  Anyway ... The new HE took about 2 hours 
to install.  The real test will be tomorrow morning during my cold and 
dark drive into work, but in testing today I would have to say the 
volume of air has roughly doubled.  It seemed nice and hot too, but it's 
45 degrees today.

Here are the pictures...

A special thanks to Chris and Jim for their help yesterday.
