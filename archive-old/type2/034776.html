Subject: Re: Beatle motor in 70 bus?

Brenden:

If it is a 70 Bug motor than it is the same inside (1600 single port). 67 to
69 would be a 1500 single port. 66 would be a 1300 single port and 65 and
older is 1200 single port. 71 and newer is 1600 dual port.

Just make sure it has a 12 volt flywheel and you should be fine.

Thank You!
