&gt; I've got nearly 200,000 miles on the thing. I know those potentiometers

I'm not sure.  What does your mechanic mean when he says the CO would 
&quot;spike way up?&quot;  Was it a transient spike, for a second or two, or would 
it spike up and stay up for considerable time?

There seem to be 2 or 3 common problems when it comes to the aging of the 
AFM.  

One problem, weakening of the air vane return spring, tends to make 
the mixture too rich overall; sometimes the idle mixture adjustment screw 
can't be backed out far enough to lean the mixture down to acceptable 
levels.  The quick fix here is to tighten up the spring enough that the 
mixture gets back down into an acceptable range with the adjustment screw 
more or less in the middle of it range of travel.

Another problem, the wearing out of the resistor strip so that there are 
&quot;dropouts&quot; as the air vane moves back and forth, will frequently show up 
as a &quot;stumble&quot; somewhere along the acceleration curve.  People have 
reported fixing this by either bending the wiper arm slightly so it 
traces a new track, or by removing the board the resister strip is on, 
enlarging the holes that the mounting screws go through, and 
re-positioning the board in the AFM.

I also understand that the air vane will sometimes stick or bind in its 
range of travel, and that this can sometimes be fixed by a partial 
dissasembly and relube of the AFM.

Logically, it seems like transient &quot;too rich&quot; spikes might be caused by 
the last problem.

&gt; Anyone know if an '89 or later one would work on my '78? I know a few 
&gt; details of the FI changed (like adding an O2 sensor on the exhaust), but 
&gt; I don't know if this part changes or not.

It's a completely different setup, using an air mass sensor instead of an 
air flow sensor, so offhand it doesn't seem like it's a &quot;bolt it on&quot; type 
of replacement.  But anything is possible!
