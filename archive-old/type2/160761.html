Subject: Re: Filtering fuel (NOT IN THE BBQ)

George said, &quot;Now, I know it pains you do do it, but use the &quot;cleaning gas&quot;
for
something else, like washing parts or lighting the barbeque.&quot;

There will be plenty of pain when you use gasoline to light the bbq.
Don't be foolish. Gasoline flashes off quickly it isn't of much use to
light charcoal. It's dangerous. And there are better products for
parts washing.

Like I said before, this things works great!

If you want to blow up yourself and your friends up by using it to
light the Kingsford, have the phone handy to dial 911.

Use the gas the way Sheik Yerbouti intended, in the Bus!
