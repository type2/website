&gt; Don't worry about anything. I just took my '78 through and passed with no
&gt; problem. I am running an extractor system also. As someone already said,
&gt; anything newer than '75 must pass DEQ and they only test for emission
&gt; standards on older vehicles. No dyno test. This one had me worried, I didn't
&gt; want some VW ignorant slamming through the gears not knowing where they
&gt; were. The guy that tested mine didn't even look in the engine bay or ask
&gt; about original equipment. He just put the wand in the exhaust, took a
&gt; reading of emissions at idle and then at 2500rpm and was done. Make sure

they also checked my gas cap of all things, took it off and put it on a
special machine, they even had the correct adapter, I guess to check to
see if it sealed correctly.
