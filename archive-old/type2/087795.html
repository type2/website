Subject: Engine Tin &amp; POR-15

My engine's out, and I'm thinking of cleaning up and painting the rusty tin
while the engine's at AVP. I wanted to slap on some basic rust treatment,
but I'm planning on doing a full restoration in about five years, with
POR-15 on everything.  In the meantime, I'm in a preservation mode with  my
bus.  If I clean the tin, apply &quot;Extend&quot;-type rust inhibitor and spray
paint, will this make it harder to do the POR-15 treatment in a few years?
I think the tin would probably last that long  without treatment, so I could
hold off if necessary.
