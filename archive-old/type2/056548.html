Subject: *ATTN* Listees in CA....

Hey All,

Home base for me is near Toronto, Canada..I have a friend who is going
to California next week and I would like him to pick up some parts for
my '70 Camper.  Can any listees recommend some Type 2 FLAPS  in the San
Jose/South Bay area which carry new/used/refurb accessories for my Bus.
I am looking for the PopTop Seal, Canvas, hub caps and the handpump for
the sink.

Any input would be greatly appreciated...

Ciao and Thanks...
