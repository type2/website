I have found this strange behavior, and come to the conclustion that this is
the problem.

When you have points on the engine, they produce a slight &quot;drag&quot; on the
distributor pinion shaft. This DRAG also helps return the vacuum advance
plate to the &quot;no advance&quot; position. If your advance mechanism is a little
stiff, when you remove the points (to install the pertronix/compufire), you
also remove this little bit of &quot;return&quot;. The result is a vacuum advance
plate that never fully returns to zero. Disassembly, inspection, cleaning,
and lubrication will result in &quot;normal&quot; operation.
