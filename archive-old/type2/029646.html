&gt; &gt; Do regular and high test really have different densities?  Back when I was
&gt; &gt; in college we had to use a special motor-driven test engine with variable
&gt; &gt; compression and standard fuels to measure octane rating accurately.
&gt; 
&gt; *Accurately* is the key, and I know about the octane test engine.
&gt; 
&gt; I did a search...the two hydrocarbons in the &quot;reference gasoline&quot; are
&gt; isooctane and normal heptane.
&gt; 
&gt; Octane--57.3 lbs/cu. ft.
&gt; Heptane--42.42 lbs/cu. ft.
&gt; 
&gt; A hydrometer and a trained operator would be able to decide whether to take
&gt; the gas back to Raleigh for further analysis. It's kinda like those little
&gt; dipsticks we used to use to screen urine for drugs--if it turns color, send
&gt; it to the test lab.

They would if gas were composed of a mixture of those two reference fuels,
but real gasoline is a mixture of hundreds of different hydrocarbon
compounds, which means that samples of the same octane could have
different compositions, and therefore different densities.
