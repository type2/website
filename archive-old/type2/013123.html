Isn't it a bitch? I made a sort of &quot;jig&quot; by grinding a notch in a bar of 
cold-roll that sort of held the rivet in place while I beat on it, but 
it really wasn't a satisfactory solution.

I suspect the best thing may just be to weld the little b_at_stards on and 
grind them off again when they break.

If you get the ones from RMMW they will crack in a few weeks, get them 
from the dealership.

&gt; back that holds the clip and all I have to show is 3 smashed fingers!  
&gt; Anybody have any tips they'd like to share???
