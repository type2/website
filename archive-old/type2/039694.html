Subject: Fouled plugs on #3 &amp; #4

Hello,
I'm new to the list and recently purchased a 82
Westfalia.  It had a new &quot;crated&quot; engine put in 95 and
has had only 9,000 miles put on the new engine since. 


Judging from the mileage, it has done some sitting. 
I have changed out the oil and added some Marvelous
Mystery Oil to the crankcase.  Also added some
Berryman B-12 to the gas tank.  Pulled the plugs and
saw that they were carbon fouled so I cleaned plugs
and reinserted.  Ran for 10 minutes and started to get
some missing and then it eventually died.  Pulled
plugs and noticed #3 and 4 were completely black and
carbon fouled!  #1 and #2 looked fine and clean. 

I have done this cleaning of the plugs and run for 10
minutes several times with the same results. I hear a
clicking noise at low idle  and it dissipates when I
step on the pedal. Assume that is either valves or
lifters and will hopefully end.

I am in Austin, TX and went to my local shop, Boer's.
He felt it might be the injectors and was probably not
low compression.  I have a compression tester and will
do a test. Back is stiff from a car accident on
Wednesday.  Any help appreciated.

Thanks 
Greg
