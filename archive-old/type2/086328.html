&gt;It will get within 5 degrees of it, and then it seems to bind up.
&gt;This is with the plugs in or out.  Doesn't matter if I am going clockwise,
&gt;or counter-clockwise to get there either.  That is where I was most
stumped.

What are the only things that could be happening here? Assuming the valves
have been set with no problems, then the next question would be is a broken
ring capable of preventing the crank from 360 turn? Probably not, then could
a spun bearing resulting from a dowel slipping out of the case be the
culprit?
Don't know. Take the valve covers off and spin the crank to find the problem
spot
sounds like on the number one or three cylinder. Might have to tear it down
to
find out where it's binding. Also that compression is questionable at best
anyway
so maybe a rebuild is in order.
