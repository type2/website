Hi Scott,

Since you mentioned the beasty boys, I'll chip in and mention that &quot;No Sleep
'Till Brooklyn&quot; is a favorite of mine while driving the bus... It even has
&quot;Bus&quot; content in it. And when you sing along, you can change it to your own
destination....

&quot;NO SLEEP TILL EVERYBUS!!!!&quot;

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Keeping with your 90's theme, anything by the beastie boys. The louder the
&gt; better.
