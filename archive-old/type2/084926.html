Subject: Brown Sports Cars in CA banned???

 From another list:


&quot;The latest (june '02) Automobile magazine came yesterday, and on page 20,
there's a news release about the Supreme Court upholding a California ban on
brown sports cars. Now I'm old enough to not get bamboozled, but there's no
disclaimer nor a hint of tongue in cheek-ness to this article. Anybody know
anything about this? I'm not making this up, but it sure was interesting.&quot;
