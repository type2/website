Robb, I'd love to hear more on your conversion.   
Advantages? Pics? Is this a higher tank capacity than
stock?

Thanks,

- Randy

Hey All, just finished converting my stove from the
standard Westy 
under-body 
propane tank to the 1lb. &quot;throw away&quot; spin on type.
Thus, if you're in 
the 
Raleigh, NC/Triangle area, and want a perfectly good,
FULL stock Westy 
tank, 
with regulator and quick disconnect fitting, drop me a
line, it's yours 
for 
the taking.
Robb
