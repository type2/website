Subject: Kick Panels
Date: Sun, 15 Oct 2000 17:44:04 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

The front kick panels in my '74 Westy are ripped and seem to be disolving.
I would like to replace them with a wooden kick panel.  However, I only have
the passenger's side kick panel and 1/2 of the driver's side.  Does anyone
have an old kick panel like something left over from replacing theirs or
maybe a template I could use to cut one laying around?  I'd appreciate the
help.

Thanks,
