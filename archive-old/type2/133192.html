Subject: ign problem?

Folks,

The scenario:

Getting ready to drive 120 miles to Tulsa on Saturday morning in the 78 
Champagne editon to go to the VW show.  Drove the bus to work yesterday
and it seemed to do fine(although a little low on power).

The problem:

78 all standard 2liter FI manual.
Checked the dwell and timing(standard points) and found that they were
waaay off.  40 degrees on the dweel and about 16 degrees off on timing!

Loosened the points(they didn't look bad at all) and readjusted to 50 
degrees and put the timing back to stock...wow!  Idles so much better that 
I had to turn the idle screw in 1 1/2 turns!

But!  After a test drive, I have either a &quot;surge&quot; or a miss..._dot_can't 
decide which.  Heavy acceleration and full throttle is great...no misses, 
plenty of power...but! at cruise, I have either a &quot;surge&quot; or a miss...I 
can't decide which....or why!  Great spark to all plugs.  Remember, this 
engine has about 2500 miles since built.

Soooo, I pull it all back out, put the pertronix back in(a whole nother 
story), and go for a test drive...same problem.  The vacuum plate moved 
smoothly by hand, but when I tested the vacuum can by sucking on it and 
watching the plate, it was not smooth...felt ...ummm jerky and &quot;rough&quot;.

I have a new svda like Aircooled_dot_net sells in the wifes car and will 
likely try it after I get home today, but am looking for clues from all of 
you other folks.

BTW, the new A/C is in and working well on a sanden 508 
rotary compressor...blew 44 degree air Monday afternoon with **NO** 
modifications to the stock engine tin!


Cheers, dave
