Subject: FS 73 Bus..give it a good home!!

Hello all,

 I normally don't advertise anything on the list except the JRMC III, which
is being held this weekend, but I want this bus to find a good home!!.

The 73 Westy I used to own is being put up for sale. The guy I sold it to
has put in a new engine, transmission, and numerous other parts. I did the
body work 3 years ago, and it looks as if he kept that up very well. This
kid loved the bus and babied it!!!

I'm not certain of the price, but he can be reached at: Blinddude1_at_msn_dot_com
or (405) 672-6518.

Please give it a good home, I'm kind of partial to it ;-)
