          Well, yes, you can do that in some instances -- however, on
the bus front axle, the inner has to sit in the hub, behind the grease
seal, then you just slide the hub onto the axle. It has to be a slip
fit, you can't put it on any other way, or you won't have a grease seal
-- which would be a no-no for the brake.
