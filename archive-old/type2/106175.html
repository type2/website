Subject: Re: [T2] Front Seats

From: &quot;Marcus Schaper&quot; &lt;marcus_at_schaper_dot_com&gt;
&gt; The reason I asked is that it is pretty rare to have rails on both sides.

As I mentioned before, I didn't know this.  Is my bus that unusual, or are
there other `77 bays with seat rails on both sides?

&gt; My camper has them on both sides but that is because it had special seats
as an option. Is your old seat weight-adjustable? My camper came with seats
the have a built in suspension that is weight-adjustable. If you have one of
these weight-adjustable seats I would like to buy it from you and help with
finding a nice set of matching seats.

The bus only had a front seat on the passenger side.  The &quot;driver's seat&quot;
was from some other sort of vehicle and was bolted down.  I moved the
passenger seat from the right side to the driver's side by sliding it off of
the rails on the passenger side and sliding it into the rails on the
driver's side.

It's not in good shape, and would need re-upholstering.  I'm not sure what
you mean by &quot;weight-adjustable&quot;.  Is there some sort of control lever for
adjusting the seat like this?  This seat has the front lever for sliding it
back and forward, and another lever for adjusting the seat back.  I didn't
see anything else.

Thanks for the offer. :O)

For those interested, the &quot;PSP Medallion&quot; page has been updated to reflect
