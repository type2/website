Subject: re: lock lubrication

I've noticed quite a lot of discussion about oiling locks.  As a locksmith
specializing in VW locks and keys, I'd like to offer some pointers.  First,
the best thing is to remove the lock and clean with carburetor cleaner (the
aerosol type).  VW used a grease similar to wheel bearing greas that turned
quite hard and when mixed with dirt and metal shavings from the lock, turned
almost solid.  If you don't use carb cleaner, WD40 can be used, but I do not
recommend it.  As far as a lubricant, DO NOT use graphite.  When mixed with
the grease on the lock, it will really gum up.  A teflon or silicon bearing
lubricant is best.  Consider Tri-Flow, available at most hardware stores.
About every 6 months, a shot of it can do wonders.

A worn key is also frequently the cause of sticking locks.  If you have an
old key, just getting a copy of that results in an old key on new brass!
Get the code number and have a locksmith make a new key from the code.
Also, beware using a hardware stor or anyone other than a locksmith to
duplicate VW keys.  Due to the fact that there is not an alignment shoulder
on one side of the key, many of the key cutters cannot accurately align the
second side.  At least half of the keys that are sent to me for duplication
are mis-cut by a considerable margin.

I hope this answers some questions.  Feel free to contact me for any VW lock
questions.
