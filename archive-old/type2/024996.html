Subject: Ashley's bad weekend

This weekend I was supposed to be taking part in a model railway exhibition
around 25 miles away in Sutton Coldfield (UK). Last year I had had problems
attending because Ashley (my van) had just come back from major work and the
electric's needed sorting out - so I took the bug instead and a smaller display.
This year I got two miles into the journey and the speedo started making a
whirring noise and the needle moved up to 90 mph (or something wrong as it
should say !). I disconnected &amp; reconnected the cable which cures the problem
for 1/2 a mile, so I called it quits and returned home. Back home I tested the
cable which appeared to be OK. I then called around until I was able to get a
replacement speedo (25 pounds for the complete set of instruments) which was
fitted and works OK. It is a speedo from a later van (Ashley is a '71 and this
is from a 73 on I think - black background &amp; white letters. MPH &amp; KM/H reading)
and looks different but having looked at the old one I think I can change the
face easily enough some time as prefer the older look.
Question: was the gearing different in later years, I'm sure that the speedo
reads slightly lower ?

Next day we set out again and get to the show OK. On the way back though the
fanbelt broke on a dual carriageway ! I didn't fancy trying to change it there
(too likely to get hit !) so called the breakdown people. An hour an a bit later
they arrived and since he had the wrong tools (told it was a K reg, didn't
realise it was an old K reg !) and didn't want to fit my spare old fanbelt
(rules etc. Must use new bits) he spent an hour getting the front bumper off so
he could put Ashley on the back of the truck - the front spoiler was in the way
of the tow rope due to the angle to get it up on the back of the lorry, apart
from this it was OK.
Still, he did it and we got home and back on the drive.
Last night I fitted a new BOSH belt - it didn't need any shims in the pulley,
are newer belts slightly longer ? Why is it &quot;toothed&quot; instead of a true V ? Belt
bought from a VW specialist (Autocavan).
All looked OK, I had stopped instantly so no overheat problems here.
How long can you travel without a fanbelt ? I know it's not far but on some
roads the risk might be worth it if you knew roughly how long the engine would
last.
Finally put the bumper on. The irons have different sized bolts in with the
inner ones being larger than the outer which are the same size as those for the
step. Both Irons are the same. Is this correct ?

Upshot is that Ashley now works OK &amp; I will NEVER take him to Sutton Coldfield
!!!  :-)

If anyone can answer any of these questions - TIA
