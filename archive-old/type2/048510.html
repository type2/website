After looking at it closer I think the Fox looks similar to the VW Polo and
Derby as sold in Europe in the mid seventies and early eighties (and the
Audi 50 which was the original) but is also sufficiently different to make
it another car. It would be interesting to know whether VW Brazil did this
one on their own, maybe using some existing parts, or that is a modfied Polo
adapted to Brazilian circumstances (much like their current Bus).

&gt;That's quite a hybrid!
&gt;
&gt;Was it a front or rear wheel drive  chassis?
