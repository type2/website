Hi folks,

This add just appeared in the Washington Citypaper (that is D.C.).

    VW CAMPER/ VAN, 1971, pop top, low-mileage engine, very little rust, new
tires, original
    interior with bed and storage, hard to find, best offer, 202/321-6420.

I called him to ask what he wants for it, and he will not say.
He did indicate some rust on the rocker panel under the sliding door.

Call him, not me.

Paul
p.s. I'll go check it out for you if you are truly interested
