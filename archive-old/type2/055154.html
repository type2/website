Subject: Near loss of engine

I was letting my 18 year old son drive my '71 the other day and while he had 
it I noticed that there was a 2 to 3 inch wide by 24 inch long oil spot where 
it had been parked before he took off in it.
I paged him and told him to be sure to check the oil because of the leak and 
to get the bus home.
When he checked the oil he saw some on the end of the dip stick and assumed 
that the oil was just at the end of the dip stick and drove the bus home (25 
miles).
It turned out that one of the stainless steel braided oil lines that goes 
&gt;from the engine to my full flow filter and cooler had a hole in it from 
rubbing against the other line and/or the rear engine mount.  I guess a wire 
&gt;from the braid broke and poked through the Teflon liner.  It took 3 quarts of 
oil to get the oil level back to where it should be.  (My bus takes 6 quarts 
to fill it because of large sump, filter and added cooler)  
What I learned:
If braided lines are touching something that they can rub against do 
something to protect them.  They aren't as bullet proof as they look.
Be sure to have at least 2 spare quarts of oil in the car.
Teach significant others how to check and add oil.
