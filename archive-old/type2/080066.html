You can get them for $12-15 at your local FLAPs.
But problems come with them...as mentioned in a previous response.
I put on on my 78 Trans..._dot_used molybolts...lasted about 3 years before 
rusting out.  Fortunately I caught it before falling off (not a pretty 
thought going 60mph)
I have heard and read of an alternative...it hooks up to your back bumper (a 
much thicker metal) ...it swings down and locks up to the bus...I saw this 
advertized in the new Bus magazine...maybe list members have a source for 
this...here.  I would like to know where to get one to.  But im sure its more 
than $12...
Aloha
