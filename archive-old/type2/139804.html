&gt; This is an email that my a friend who was helping me

&gt; Its funny to me becuase its true.  This happened at 3
&gt; in the morning.  I hope someone else can enjoy this.
&gt;
&gt; How to change the fuel filter on a 1975 VW, Type 2,
&gt; Westfalia Camper
&gt; Van.

or
1) turn shut off valve on fuel line
2) change filter
3) open shut off valve on fuel line
skip to step 14

not as much fun but less painfull.

(of course I have in the past tried your method)

14 step prochedure deleted to save the guilty from too much embaressment
