&gt;Ok, y'all can see me in finest moment at
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/shame.html

I can't believe they didn't make special mention of the cool-looking
aftermarket mirror and the finishing touch of removing the hub cap to
show off the finely detailed rear hub.  

And (in this photo anyway), you look more like T(h)om Cruise and one can
just imagine you sitting up there saying, &quot;Sometimes you just gotta say,
what the f...!&quot; 

Thanks for sharing.
