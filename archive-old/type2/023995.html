Perry,

If you're going to Phoenix to check out VW's, whether it's a bus or a camper, 
be sure to check with LeSueur's VW in Tempe.  It's at 1109 E. Curry Rd. just 
east of Phoenix.  Tel. 480-968-6611  They bill themselves as the largest 
unofficial VW dealer in the country.  When I was there recently they had 7 or 
8 buses and campers, as well as about 30 other VW's.  They are not an 
official VW dealership.  All the vehicles are reconditioned and checked out 
used vehicles.  

Good Luck, David Hunt
