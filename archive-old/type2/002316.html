This will only be of interest to UK readers, so if your not please ignore

I have been trying to source all of the wonderous insulation products etc
mentioned by Mr Bully, here is the reply from Marly roofing re Koolpatch :

FAO Mr J Walters


Thank you for your e-mail of 28th May, upon looking at the information that
you have sent us, and also looking at Koolseals web page; I am afraid to say
that none of our bituminous paints or sealants have been specified for the
use you require......that's not to say they cannot be used, they just have
not been tried in that situation.

I have asked our marketing department to send you out literature on our
waterproofing products; that should hopefully be of some assistance
