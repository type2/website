Subject: Places to stay along  I -10 and !-40 

My name is Brian Lanahan and I will be driving from Houston TX to Santa 
Barbara Ca in my 68 Double Cab. I am driving to Cal. to start Grad school. I 
have not decide what route I am going to take to get out there. I may take 
I-10 or 1-40,any opinions on either would help. what i am looking form is a 
place to crash for one night along the way with a fellow list member. I am 
going to plan my around if/were i can stop. So if you live near either of 
those roads and don't mind if a third grade teacher sleeps in your driveway 
get back to me.   lano
