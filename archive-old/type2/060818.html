1)Leaky windscreen seal allows water to soak fuse box and relays causing all
sorts of problems especially relays. Headlight dimmer relay will fill up
with water and first highbeams wont work then the lows go. Flasher relay
will short which will be indicated by indicator lights on the speedo coming
on but not flashing when turnsignal or E-flasher are engaged. Please
investigate this before you replace that expensive turn signal. Check out
possible solution at www.Type2_dot_com and select the Features button. You will
find a  hard-core solution but it works.

2)Those pesky sunvisor clips always break.

3)Top roller on sliding door loses its robustness and causes door to rattle.
Anybody got a fix for this?

4)Lock cylinder comes out with key when you open the door. There will be a
Type Feature on this soon.

5)Hey, where did my battery tray go?
