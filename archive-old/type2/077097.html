Subject: Re: [T2] Kadron Vacuum Source

The vacuum source for distributor vacuum isn't simply a passage to the 
manifold.  It is a precise port in the throat of the carburator that 
senses the opening of the throttle butterfly.  I'd be very cautious of 
an attempt to simply drill a hole in the carburator.
