Subject: Weber prog manifold boots

I recently mentioned in an email to the list that my bus was only running 
on 3 cylinders. The problem revealed itself on the weekend - one of the 
rubber inlet manifold boots on the dreaded weber progressive had perished 
letting in lots of air. The boots go between the chamber that the carb sits 
on and each inlet manifold pipe.

Does anybody know where I can get replacement boots? I had a look around a 
few VW web sites and nothing jumped out at me.

Cheers,

Martin Strandgard
