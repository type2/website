Sounds very much like the valve train isn't getting lubricated until
the engine's running for a minute or so. Have you checked the oil level?
Sounds the most obvious thing, I know. Does it rattle when you have been
parked on a slope, or after heavy cornering/braking/acceleration? Have you
checked your valve clearances are correct (6/1000 inch)?

RE:	Rattle in engine

When I first start my engine, there is a very pronounced rattle,  sounds
almost like an exhaust fitting is loose, but all are tight.  I 've
checked for loose tin, loose pulleys etc. but everything appears fine.
As the engine warms up, the rattle only happens occasionally.  Some
days, I don't hear it at all.  Other times it rattles constantly.  Any
other things you can think to check, let me know.
ps. It doesn't match any of the Muir engine sounds.
