Subject: RE: Looking for Gas Heater Parts

&gt;
&gt;I am on the verge of installing a gas heater in my 82 Vanagon and am on the
&gt;lookout for two parts:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If you have these items for sale or know of a place where I can locate 
them,
&gt;please let me know.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I just spoke to a gentleman from Automotive Heater Technology, who 
sells/rebuilds/repairs the gas heaters for VW's.    His name is Ark Mirvis 
from New Jersey,  PH  201-398-6363
This is his home number, and when I called there, his wife had him call me 
right back, and he said he has all types of gas heaters and parts.    I am 
calling him back tonite for more info, but I wanted to know, has anyone 
gotten heaters or parts from him?   How reliable?    He says it will fit 
under the bench seat of my 79 westy.    How do these vent?  Any more advice 
on these heaters?

BTW, I found him  listed at  http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/
