Subject: VW Family Feud: Question Ideas

I am trying to come up with some questions for a VW bus verion of the Family 
Feud.  I figured you uys could come up with a ton of potential questions. 
Thanks for any input:  here are a few samples to get some ideas from - be 
sure to think how questions were worded on the family feud.

EXAMPLES
Name a spart part you ALWAYS carry in your Bus?

What is the first place you stop after a weekend camping in your bus?

Name something you can't go camping without in your bus.

Once the list is complied I will post the survey questions to the list so we 
can found out how many people say what!  :-) If we get enough questions and 
responces the LIVE version of teh game will played at the campfire during 
The High Country Bus Festival.

thanks for any input:   please send question ideas to
buddahvw_at_hotmail_dot_com

thanks again!
buddah
