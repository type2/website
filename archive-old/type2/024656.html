   Is anyone interested in buying my 79 Westy?  Both interior and exterior are
in very good condition and all camp equipment is in working order.  Canvas is
in excellent condition and interior is all original. The engine runs but needs
some work.  Compression is low on several cylinders.  I have neither the time
or finances to do the job right and would hate to run her into the ground or
watch her rot.  This bus is in good condition and does run, it needs a through
engine overhaul to make her complete.  I would appreciate someone lightning my
load.  This is also my fourth vehicle and space is becoming limited as well.
I am in San Francisco. I would like to get $2000.00 but Offers can be
negotiated as well:)

thanks to all in advance
Dan 
65 bus
