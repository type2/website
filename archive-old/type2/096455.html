Subject: Re: [T2] Who Designed These Windows?




Just finished removing all of mine(78 bus) for a paint job, and the 
Bentley is *no* real help here.  The trick is that the winder will not 
come out without the vent wing frame being out.

The winder mechanism loops *over* the raised area for the bolt that
holds the bottom part of the vent wing frame.

If you have to take out the vent wing frame you need two people as 
you are 99% guaranteed to bend your outer chrome scraper carrier.

I ended up pulling my glass up thru the frame as I couldn't see how it 
could come out thru the bottom at all.

There may be other methods that work.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hiya List,
&gt; 
&gt; To get the rear window channel (that little &amp;*%#_at_!#) back in place I had to 
&gt; remove my driver's side door window glass.  I managed to do that without 
&gt; removing the winder mechanism.  But it looks as if I'll have to remove the 
&gt; winder mechanism in order to get the glass back in.  The problem is that the 
&gt; winder does not want to come out.  Is there some kinda trick to getting it 
&gt; out?  
&gt; 
&gt; I followed Bentley up to step 8 on page 14 of Body &amp; Frame.  Step 8 reads, 
&gt; &quot;Press the window front guide (huh?) channels off its bracket.  Then, through 
&gt; the gap thus formed, pull the window lifter assembly downward and out of the 
&gt; door.&quot;  What the heck are they talking about?
&gt; 
&gt; HEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLP!
