LOL.  Certain Maaco franchises have the reputation of being fairly =
contientous and careful even with the ridiculously low $200 (or whatever =
it is now) price.  Others are known to do a really sloppy job.  If =
someone has used a Maaco in seattle and has an experience to share, =
please let me know.  Otherwise don't bother chastising me for going the =
cheap route.   I'm not looking for a miracle, just a different color =
thats looks good from 20 feet away. =20

Hal,

Please enlighten me--How do you plan on &quot;maximizing&quot; a $200.00
investment?

A gallon of automotive standard's type paint and prep materials, cost
more than $200.00.

&quot; The btterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of the
&quot;good deal&quot;is gone&quot;----
