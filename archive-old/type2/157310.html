Subject: Re: [T2] Blueprinted 

This is hearsay, but good hearsay.

At GE Aircraft Engines, and I am told other similar places,
parts are tested to a fare-thee-well.  Once in a while a part
is found to have zero defects.  Such parts are called &quot;zulu&quot;
parts.  They are diverted from the main manufacturing stream
and, for example, the engines in Air Force One and Marine One
are made exclusively of zulu parts, as are other VIP aircraft.

There is a business driver behind this: If an airplane goes
down and it is a GE engine at fault it is very bad but if
Marine One goes down and POTUS dies because of an engine
failure it's a worst case PR disaster.
