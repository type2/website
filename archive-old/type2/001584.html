Hello list folks,
I have had my motor out for about a week now (71 hardtop camper,1600dp) to
replace the clutch disc. In the process I have spent many hours tinkering
and enjoying the special bond of newbie air-cooled mech and sage wizened
bus. It's as if my bus has been looking back over her shoulder wondering
what the heck I'm doing back there. The feeling is mutual, as the experience
has been a first for me. I do feel empowered by the process and have spent a
great deal of time on the list and pouring over the four manuals lying at
the base of my beast.

It is time to get the engine back in and wanted to know if there is anything
else to do before reinstalling.
Work done to date:
1) new tranny seal and topped off the transaxle
2) inspection of the clutch cable and lever and rod assembly
3) new throw out bearing
4) inspect the starter bushing
5) replaced the main seal and o ring, set end play
6) new pressure plate, reinstallation of flywheel and clutch disc plate
assembly
7) replaced all fuel lines, moved fuel filter to under side of bus, ( was
perched above the dizzy)
8) cleaning of motor and engine compt.
9) tightening and inspection of every bolt/screw and generally snooping into
every nook and cranny
10)  cleaning of battery tray and battery

I welcome any further areas of concern or advise as to what to check before
reuniting the girl and her giddy up.  The plan is to get the motor back in
on Tuesday.....thanks and &quot; what a long strange trip it's been&quot;

Mr Bill
71 hardtop ...all I know as of yet is that it's a &quot;girl&quot;
