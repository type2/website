Subject: Oh no! Burned a ring!

Hi Volks,

I was driving home last week and felt a temporary loss of power. My head
temp gaurge shot from its usual 350F to something near 500F Yikes! I
slowed down and it came back down over the next few minutes, but last time
I saw that happen I'd burned a ring.

Next morning, the surfbus made unmistakeable, &quot;I&quot;m NOT driving you to work
this morning&quot; sounds. A quick trip around the block and it felt like it
was missing badly. Very rough. Would barely idle. Intermittent white smoke
from the tailpipe. Home for a compression check: plug #4 looks blackened
and a little oily.  Cylinder #4 has 25psi. Adding squirts of oil gives me
35psi. I've been here before. Bummer.

Well maybe I've been trying too hard to keep up with 75-80mph traffic
while commuting in my '78 Westy. My auxiliary oil cooler keeps me nice and
cool and it's been running great for months.  But sometimes rings just
burn and/or freeze, I've found. Glad this one did so near home.

Now I own a garage at long last, so I can put the bus in it and rebuild it
in a couple of months when I have time. Time to go buy a commuter car.
Here we go again.

In the 10 years I've owned my bus, I've burned rings 3x and lost valves
0x. What are other folks' numbers on this?
