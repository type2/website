Subject: Where to find a good 2.0 engine? Ideas anyone?

Hi friends,
I think my bus may be rapidly approaching that time in
her life when her owner has to start looking around
for a new heart to replace the old one which although
full of great karma, needs a little more then a
pacemaker. Any ideas or experience with getting a
rebuilt engine, preferably for free but if thats not
possible, at least relatively cheap?
Thanks, 
Giles
