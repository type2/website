&gt; I have a 1973 westfalia with a sink and ice box unit.
&gt; The table that folds down next to the sliding door is
&gt; missing. If that is not an accurate enough
&gt; description, when down, it covers up the spice
&gt; cabinet. When up, it blocks the door from closing. I
&gt; will also need the support leg (hinges would also be
&gt; nice). If anyone has any info, it is appreciated.

What color is the top of the main table?

Solid white?  Or white w/faint black lines?

I have both, complete spice racks...... The ones with the faint black lines
have real metal hinges. The solid white ones have plastic wanna-be hinges
that break....I replace them with real metal hinges.
