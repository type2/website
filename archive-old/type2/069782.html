Subject: Screwed up our '71 Westy...

Man!

Sometimes things just don't go right... Crawled under our '71 yesterday
to get her ready to go to the Adirondacks. Hmm - that's strange - all of
the valves seem to be too tight. All of them. Last adjustment was done
when we bought the camper about 3,000 miles ago, and was done by a pro.
Well, can't hurt to readjust them, right?

Adjusted everything - and now it runs like heck. Exhaust is smelly, it's
backfiring once in a while...

Did we get them too loose? Guess so - we're going to go crawl under the
thing now... :)
