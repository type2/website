When you do work on the rear brakes don't forget the rear brake hoses.  I 
recently did a brake job on my 71 transporter and the left rear brake would 
lock up in a panic stop.  Turns out the right rubber hose was swollen 
completely shut.  Between the time I bled the brakes and put the car on the 
road it gave up the ghost.  When I took it off I couldn't force air through 
it.  Since I replaced it my brakes work better than they ever have.  I didn't 
know a bus could stop so well.
