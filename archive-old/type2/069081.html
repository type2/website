Subject: Re: dial indicator

You can make your own end play indicator from a large washer (about 2&quot;, the
fender kind), two nuts that thread onto a valve adjusting screw, and a bolt
to hold the washer to the engine wher the holes are for the upper mounting
bolts.  Weld or braise the two nuts in place on the washer by locking then
onto the adjusting bolt and gripping the edge of the washer. Leave the
adjusting bolt in.  As I recall, the edge of the washer has to be
cut/ground down so it clears a lip and sits flat over bolt hole on engine.
Pull flywheel out, turn screw in so it JUST touches flywheel.  Push
flywheel in, measure gap with feeler gauge!!!!
