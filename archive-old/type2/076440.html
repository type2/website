Subject: 75 bus fuel injection ? stalls at idle

--part1_13c.724c547.29656a22_boundary

Hello all knowing vw guru's ok the wifes 75 bus new to us runs good when cold 
starts up easy cold but after a while it stalls then restarts the dwell is 
37-38 and drops with rpm. But tonite I discover that the ruber s tube that 
runs from the air fuel meter to the trottle body is cracked enough that it 
lets light threw it.  Could this maybe part of the ploblem or the ploblem im 
thinking any unregelated air is bad. Plu i read the injection is fired from 
the points according to bently.
Help before i give up and Weberize this Bus
Thanks
