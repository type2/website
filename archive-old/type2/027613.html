&gt;&gt;The shop you're referring to, would that happen to be Bugformance in 
&gt;&gt;Sunnyvale? &lt;&lt;

No, not that shop.  I've been on lists where vendor bashing got out of hand 
and I'm leary to even go there, but I'll drop you a private note.

&gt;&gt;Anyway, I've been running into some of the things you're encountering now 
&gt;&gt;when you look under your bus, all kinds of missing things.  It's a wonder 
&gt;&gt;how some people let things go. &lt;&lt;

What makes me wonder is that I'm sure everything was there before I took it 
in but I can't prove it because I didn't know to look for these things or to 
expect they might disapear (black market?) I wonder if the old stock fan is 
hidden under my new doghouse shroud?  Ya know things like that.  As I look 
at my receipt I don't see a &quot;new fan&quot; listed, but since the doghouse shroud 
is wider I assume I should have paid for and gotten a new, wider fan.  I was 
willing to pay so why cut that corner?!!?!!

&gt;&gt;As for the heater system in your bus, the heat exchangers are attached to 
&gt;&gt;the y-pipe by two big accordion-looking plastic pipes, which can be 
&gt;&gt;somewhat easily found (Bus Depot, Bus Boys, etc.)  As for the flaps that 
&gt;&gt;close off air flow into the y-pipe, I've heard they can rust shut or open, 
&gt;&gt;depending on their position when the cables break. &lt;&lt;

My flaps move freely but I can't fit my big hand inside to feel which way is 
closed or open.  Time to browse the catalogs.  Thanks Jim.
