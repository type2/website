&gt;Did we ever get a definitive answer on that?  Did anyone actually
&gt;measure it with a tape measure

I don't know.

&gt;This is so totally unimaginable to me
&gt;that... I can't even imagine it.

&gt;It *can't* be true,
&gt;it simply *can't* be!

I don't think you've ever worked for a large corporation, Rodney. ;)
