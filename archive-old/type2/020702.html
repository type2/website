You can answer this for yourself by looking at any aged Westy post 1972-
the one behind the sink gets opened a lot less that the one on the
sliding door.  Crank each open half way and then grab one from the
outside and lift up and down....note the up and down play- this is an
indication of wear....and increases the more you drive with it open,
since the draft makes them wobble up and down.  If you drive with them
open a lot, you increase the play in all the pivots (basically rivets)
as well as in the gear that opens/shuts the window.
