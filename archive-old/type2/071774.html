Hiya Robert,

You don't mention whether the rheostat is still good in your 71 switch.  If 
it's not (the little springy wrap-around gizmo is usually shot) don't even 
mess with it.  Another thing to consider is that your headlight switch acts 
like a central junction box for your electrical system.  You want to be sure 
that you have a good switch.  And all this sounds like I'm going to say, 
&quot;Spend the bucks and get a new switch.&quot;  Well, maybe...................  But 
do be aware of one thing.  Aftermarket headlight switches vary a great deal 
in quality.  Get the very best switch you can find and stay away from 
Taiwanese stuff.
