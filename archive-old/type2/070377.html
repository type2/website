hey now,

today i took rumba to my friend sean's shop to check the valves and torque the
heads if needed. i learned how to do a valve job properly....:-). i had read
everything i could and actually attempted it once.....BUT it seems so much
easier when someone who knows what they are doing shows you how. i will now do
my own valves! :-) the heads didn't need torquing, and the valves were a little
tight but not anything to worry about. the engine now has 500 miles on it and
runs GREAT! a little oil leakage at the oil temp sender that i will hopefully
correct tommorrow when i change the oil and oil filter. will install all gauges
this weekend...hopefully. it's nice to be back driving the bus.

i'm heading up to asheville this weekend to visit my fiancee. anyone around the
lake lure area?

take care,

jonathan
