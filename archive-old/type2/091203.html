Subject: i can't see paradise cuz my dashboard lights are too dim...

sorry 'bout that... it just came to me and i couldnt resist...

oh mighty and all-knowing list....
how the H**L do i get the vent levers off the dash of my 70 bus so i can
remove the dash to change the tiny lightbulbs? do the lever ends slide
out or do i have to undo something under the dash first? i was so excited
to get these lightbulbs so i might finally be able to see my speedometer
at night!!! now i cant get to it... i am bummed.

thanks for your help!
