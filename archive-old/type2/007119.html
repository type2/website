&gt; Does anyone know of a source for the large vacuum hose the goes from the
&gt; manifold to the steel line (that runs to the front of the bus)?

Check out a tractor or heavy equipment shop/supply house.  You're looking for high pressure hydraulic line with about a 1/2&quot; inside diameter (ID).

Has to be hydraulic hose because just about any other hose you can find today will collapse under the force of the vacuum.

BTW - that line is for your brake booster.  If it is leaking , you're running lean and maybe hot.  I'd plug the port on the manifold till i found a suitable replacement.

Joe Fournier gave us a source for the right hose last year sometime. Joe - care to interject?
