&gt; 1. Only while the brake is NOT on, and only at lower speeds, I can hear and
&gt; FEEL an almost thumping kind of sound coming from the front end. It appears
&gt; to be originating on the passenger side, but I can not be 100% sure...Any
&gt; ideas?

Possibly a tire developing a &quot;knot&quot;.  Raise each wheel, one at a time, and
rotate the tire.  First, do a visual for any thin looking patches or steel
belts peeping out (don't laugh... I've seen them!), then spin the tire and
let your hand ride on the tread... feel any unevennesses? If so, replace
that tire.

&gt; 2. There is a rubber boot on something behind the backing plate ( ball
&gt; joint? ) that is torn open and full of crud. Is this bad and if so, can I
&gt; fix it myself?

Yup, ball joint.  The torn boot is a very bad sign, but not 100% that the
joint is ruined yet. A front end shop can tell you if it is.  If it's bad
this could also be the cause of your problem.  Bus Boys will sell you
replacement trailing arms with new ball joints pressed in for ~$175, plus
core and shipping (Bus Boys, correct me if I'm wrong... these prices are 2
years old)
