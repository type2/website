Subject: Re: [T2] Winter rustproof -- Rotisserie?

That would be me.

However, I am no longer affiliated with Germansupply.

Here is a link to a picture of the rotisserie I helped a friend make for his

We were able to spin the bus 360 degrees in my suburban home.

Pretty cool.

&gt;had
&gt;a site up about theirs also.
