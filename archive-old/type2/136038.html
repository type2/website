Subject: Re: [T2] Lower mounting studs for case

courtney try to find someone that has a old case laying round and you might find the studs still in them.
you can pull the studs with a stud puller and then you will have to drill the other one/s out of your case and use a rethreader for that size threads and walaahhhhh .....
key is finding them in a case? one of the vendors might carry them?
peace and love
chris
good luck

Managed to snap off the lower engine case stud that projects out the bottom
of my AH case, and bolts up to the tranny using 17mm nuts. One of the two
big bottom ones. That leaves me with 3 to bolt the engine into place, which
is not a good thing. Has anyone seen these for sale anywhere? I can't seem
to locate one anywhere.

Thanks,

Courtney
