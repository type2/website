Subject: Not an Everybus trip report - Steve's rants on owning and buying a
 VW bus - LONG!
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10104242033170.3984-100000_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Volks,

Well, as others have said, Everybus was a heck of a great campout, and
Chris and the Full Moon Bus Club did a heck a of a great job!  Hip, HIP,
HOORAY!

While I was there, I talked to a number of people, some of whom were in
the market... wanna bussers.  I started writing a response to one this
evening, and it got so long and so general that I thought I would post it
in hopes of exciting comment.  Someone back a bit commented that a bus
costs $5,000. It either costs that up front or it costs that in eventual
repair bills before it is reliable.  While my estimate is a bit lower, I
very much agree with the idea behind it.  I am strongly of the opinion
that buying cheap and repairing is the better way to go, as I love to work
on my bus. but see what I have written below.  These are my &quot;rants&quot; on
buying a bus and what sort to buy.  Comments are, as usual, very welcome!

Steve's rant on owning an old VW:

The thing I love about buses is that they are very easy to work on and if
you do a little work every so often, they are very cheap and reliable
vehicles.  The down side, tho, is that they do *require* work, and they do
require it on a regular basis.  Modern cars can be taken for granted. Take
it to a mechanic ever year or so and you are done ('til it blows up and
needs $5K worth of work, of course :-). With VW's, you have to be prepared
to give at least one day a month to the car... and it has to be *you* who
does the work.

First, no one cares like you do, even your friends who help. Second,
because they require work regularly, if you pay someone to work on it,
they get to be pretty expensive to own pretty fast.  I see people come on
the list all the time who start with &quot; I just bought a bus and I took it
to my mechanic and he says it will need $nnnn (fill in the blank with your
fave outrageous sum) work.&quot;  The thing is that this translates (usually)
to $50 worth of parts and $nnnn worth of labor.

*You* need to supply the labor, or your bus wil eat you out of house and
home :-( The parts are out there and they are not too expensive
(especially compared to new cars), but VWs are more labor-intensive than
newer cars and will ask more of you.  On the more positive side, a new
minivan costs at least $20K, and you cannot spend that much for a VW, even
if you try! If you price a new Dodge Caravan, get the monthly payment and
then put even half that amount in the bank every month, you will find that
even if you need to put a new engine in your bus, you will still have save
enough in a single year to get you to Europe and back! (Unless, of course,
you are already there, in which case, substitute North America.  :-)

Steve's rant on *buying* a bus:

My philosophy on getting a new bus is that the best way to go about it is
to find the best body that you can.  Look for rust-free, look for
straight, look for a nice interior, look for &quot;all parts present.&quot;  I do
*not* look at mechanical condition.  Actually, I tend to look for *bad*
mechanical condition!  Blown engine?  Fine!  No brakes?  Wonderful!  
needs front end work? No problem!  I *love* a blown engine!  It drops the
price like a shot duck!

If you buy a van with a running engine, then you have to smile while the
PO tells you about what a fine engine it is!  That it has run beautifully
for all the miles that he has owned it! etc. etc. etc.  At the end of the
sales spiel, you have no idea of its real condition (and he probably
doesn't either) To find that out, you need to do a *lot* of diagnostic
work.  Even then it could blow tomorrow and you have no recourse.  If it
comes with a dead engine, then you *know* the condition of the engine...
it's DEAD! So you buy a new one, and you figure that into the purchase
price.  Then you know the condition of the engine, and you have a
warrantee.

Brakes... I don't care when they were last done, or by who... I am gonna
replace them no matter what. Just my habit.  Again I like to know that the
condition of the brakes is *new*.  The whole new brake system on the '67
cost me less than $300 and was worth every penny!

Front end is difficult...  New ball joints are ~$200, new tie rods and
drag link ~$150, idler bearing on a loaf is $50.  That part is fine.  If
they are bad, I just replace, and I *expect* to replace.  Front beam rust
is a bigger issue.  *Usually* if the bus body is good, the beam is too,
but I have seen good bodies with kkkrusty beams!  A new beam is a major
job. A solid weekend with 2 people and nothing I would wish on a novice!
If the beam is rusty, pass on the bus, at least as a first effort.

Basically, my experiencee is that each bus I have bought has cost me a
year in VW hell.  Before I am happy, I will need to replace a bunch of
stuff, do a lot of maintainance, and will have a number of breakdowns.
After that year is over, I will have a bus that needs minimal attention
for the next 5-10 years, but the first year is sure to be a
&lt;euphemism&gt;bear&lt;/euphemism&gt;!
