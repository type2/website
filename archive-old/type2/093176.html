&gt;2) And is there such a thing as a five speed, and if so, how easy to put 
&gt;in ? (I have this friend who has a 1980 Datsun Sentra wagon [I think that 
&gt;is the year] who had his reverse blow out on him, so the mechanic offered 
&gt;to put in a five speed and he has been happy ever since)

Yes - sort of. A Porsche 901 tranny will fit just fine, requires some 
custom work.

$1000+.
