&gt; I have a 77 Westfalia Automatic that I bought awhile ago with the engine out

&gt; bundle, they are by themselves)that I have no idea where they go.  The wires
&gt; have number's 12 and 40 on them.  I've looked in the manual and on the web but
&gt; have not found anything about these wires.  Any help would be appreciated.


what color are they,  sound like wires that go to the coil but check first
