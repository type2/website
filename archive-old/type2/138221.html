&gt;This thread about the Bentley CDROM is something I'm interested in

&gt;work with VirtualPC on a Mac or not?

Yes but it's very slow to use.

&gt;I can install whatever version of 
&gt;Windows would be required. My interest would only be to get it 
&gt;installed so I can export all the files as .pdfs that I can access in 
&gt;native MacOS mode.

I did that on Mac OS X. It takes a long time to do it but it's worth it.

&gt;I have no more machines with Intel processors and 
&gt;really don't want to get one just to access the Bentley CD. I really 
&gt;would like to get copies of the fiches though.

There are no fiches on the Bentley CDs. Only scans of the workshop manuals which you CANNOT search.
