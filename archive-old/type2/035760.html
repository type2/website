Subject: Re: Status of list pics(thnx!)

The only thing I can think of is that the &quot;bad&quot; pics are kept on a MAC
server, and that the pics were created on a MAC. The MAC keeps a &quot;resource
header&quot; on every file to tell the MAC what program created the file, etc...
Maybe there's something with the server/browser that ignores the header?

Try saving it as a BMP file, then convert to JPG.

Then again, maybe not.
