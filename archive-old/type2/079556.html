 At that setting 
&gt;the 009 only goes to 28 degrees. So, I've always had 7.5 BTDC static timing.
&gt;    Today I got to thinking about the advice given to me earlier in the 
&gt;year. &quot;Set the timing at 32 degrees at full advance....&quot; I know if I do 
&gt;this, the static timing goes to 11 ish.
&gt;   I figure if anyone knows, someone has to know here. What's everyone elses 
&gt;take on this???

The 009 has a reasonable advance curve for the earlier T-I motors, however,
it simply will not work decently with the T-IV, which needs a wider curve.
Buy a stock distributor and you will get your money back in better
drivability, better gas milage and the motor will last longer. In this
case, cheap does not mean inexpensive.
