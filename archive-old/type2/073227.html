Andrew Davies wrote of the still-evolving Events page:

&gt;You might want to click the small text _at_ the bottom of the page to gain the
&gt;first of the 10 &quot;thou-shalt-nots&quot; _at_ a show/convoy pub meet, I am accepting
&gt;submissions to these commandments as quickly as you can think of them =)

I think you misunderstood what we meant when we said &quot;aircooled&quot;. =^ )

The bus public is to understand that responsibility for any rude noises on
the site belongs entirely to the British Contingent. Also if you are
missing any checkers it is because they have been using them for bungs.

Yours in deportment,
