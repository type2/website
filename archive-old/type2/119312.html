&gt; dealer) it had a tach in the hole to the right of the
&gt; speedo..

No, that hole was for a clock.

Bus Boys sells a mounting ring that'll make a VDO 3 1/8'' tach fit 
perfectly in the hole.  I think it's a pretty common modification (I'm 
going put one in that same spot on my dash pretty soon).
