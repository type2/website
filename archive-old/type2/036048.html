&gt; If the vac pump will suck fluid past the master
&gt; cylinder seals, can't it also suck air past old wheel
&gt; cylinder seals?

When you have your foot off the brake pedal and you have free play in the
pedal linkage, the fill port and the pressure port are open. If you open a
bleeder screw, you can gravity bleed the circuit to that wheel. The master
cylinder reservoir will empty itself. This is how pressure bleeders work,
they supply more pressure than gravity. By pulling vacuum on a bleeder screw
you are NOT pulling fluid past any seals.
