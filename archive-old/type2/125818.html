 ....spent the day designing and building a wooden model of a hitch.  I was 
pleased with the outcome (even though I did not have a 2X2
to represent the crossbar.  My question is:  do you think the receiver is too 
close to my exhaust?  It's maybe 1/2 inch.  I could go
with a 1 1/4 inch receiver and gain 3/4 inch.  Let me know.  Thanks!

Hey Jamie -- two responses:

(1) I think I've got something almost exactly like this... came off a bus of 
same vintage, same color even!  Where are you located (geographically)?  I am 
~20 miles east of Annapolis, Maryland.

(2) Why are you allowing a little sheet metal to dictate your design?  If it 
bothers you to cut away parts of the rear apron, get another from a boneyard, 
put an abrasive blade in your table saw, don safety glasses, and chop away.  I 
would raise the receiver and add some triangular bracing, to reduce stress on 
the welds to the crossbar.  A little muffler heat on the receiver isn't going 
to do it any harm, but you might arrive at a stronger design over-all by 
putting the receiver in the same plane as the crossbar.... YMMV

Glenn
