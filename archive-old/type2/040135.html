Subject: Oil filter wrenches (more)

I just got back from the NAPA and I got a 3-Jaw Oil Filter Wrench for
$5.99!!!!! $6.48 with tax. Yeeee-ha! Part number 775-9018, fits filters
2-1/2&quot; to 3-3/4&quot;.

Needless to say, I've decided against ordering the one from Eastwood.
Unless this one turns out to be a POC and breaks the first time I use it.
