Subject: Air box-smog question-HELP ('78)

I just went a checked out a DREAMY '78 westy with all the smells and
thistles, er, whatever.

VERY NICE $3000
original tan paint, all is there and functioning

The question, will it pass smog if the air box is not quite perfect?  Owner
claims that it works fine around here, but up in the mountains, he had
problems.
I was glad he told me this, it did run fine at 150ft above the ocean.

Do you think I can smog this &quot;AS IS&quot;  at this low elevation,  or do I need
to put on a new air flow meter?

thanks, rex
