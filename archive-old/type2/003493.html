&gt; If you want new wiring, why grab a junker harness that could have as many

&gt;
&gt; You could spend the effort to compare the 72 and 74 wiring diagrams and
find
&gt; the differences, adding a few cables here or there to the 72. They can't
be
&gt; terribly different for those years, both carbed, both bays, etc...

Good idea--Other than the fuse block being in a diffrent place, and the smog
pump on the 74.  What other diffrences are there, Bill?

&gt; &gt; &gt; The main wiring harness in my project '74 Westy is in dire need of
&gt; &gt; &gt; replacement.  But the closest I can find in catalogs is for a '72.
Does
&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone have any experience in modifying the '72 harness?  Or are there
&gt; any
&gt; &gt; &gt; other alternatives?  The bus has a non-FI 1.8L.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Darren.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That's right, the aftermarket wiring specialists (like Wiring Works in
San
&gt; &gt; Pedro Ca.) only make them for the earlier years.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Find a salvage yard that has a good used one you can pull.  Check with:
&gt; &gt; www.interstatevw_dot_com their in Lakeside, Ca.
