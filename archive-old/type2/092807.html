&gt;Is the flow rate a function of both vacuum (suck) and pump (push) action?

I don't know if the stock regulator supports this.  In normal operation, 
the answer is no.  There should never be a push action which would raise 
the fuel pressure above what it would be with zero vacuum at the port.  The 
only time you would see this would be with a supercharger or turbocharger, 
and the regulator would have to be capable of responding to positive 
manifold pressure.

&gt;Is the function of the FI regulator to keep the flow rate independent of 
&gt;pump, vacuum and atmospheric pressure variations?

True for pump variations, false for vacuum and atmospheric variations.  It 
is my understanding that the function of the regulator is to maintain a 
specific fuel pressure for a given load on the engine.  The vacuum signal 
is used to determine the load on the engine.  More vacuum means low load 
and therefore a leaner mixture.  Less vacuum means high load and therefore 
a richer mixture.
