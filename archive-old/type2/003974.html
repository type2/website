Having gone to clean the blood off Mr whipy, (the police &amp; medical services
having spent most of today looking for the rest of his digits or phalanges
(ain't I a posh like). I checked that indeed nothing had been stolen, only
to find that he left a very nice 'slim Jim' &amp; a very expensive slide hammer.
I've always wanted a good slide hammer!

For those of you who are blood thirsty, the belly pan was VERY rusty!
JOY!!!
