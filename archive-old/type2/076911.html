&gt; Boy, I like this idea, having considered redoing my camper interior

&gt; Seems kinda steep for plyboard. I'd be happy even up to a grand, but
&gt; you're looking at 2,242.50 for the upper end job before shipping it
&gt; across country. I don't have that furniture value in my living room.

Billy,

Trot on down to Home Depot and price the flat-pack &quot;Mills Pride&quot; kitchen
cabinets, then over to a furninture store and try to fill your
house/apartment with furniture similar to what you have now.

Particle board and laminate may be cheap, but case work is *expensive*!
If you had the choice in the 1970s, the optional Westy package would have
set you back about what this package will cost you.  I am amazed that they
kept the cost down as low as they have.

I am looking at and lusting after the latest Westfalia package  (the
&quot;James Cook&quot;) and figure that it probably will add at least $25,000 to the
base price of the shell. Compared to $25,000, $2,500 soulds very nice :-)
