Hi, Eddie

I've had a 1970 bus for 5 months, and have dealt with the Rabbit Hutch in
Tualatin [south suburb, off I-5 exit 289 or 290 I think].  [503] 692-2930. 
They've been in business since the mid-1970s.  They haven't done lots of
work for me, but I was satisfied with what they did.  And when things
aren't too hectic they seem willing to stop and answer questions, trade
ideas, etc. 

Hope this helps.  And if you find a good junkyard, let me know too.

best
Bill
