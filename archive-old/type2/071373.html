This unscrewing of nuts and bolts off the exhaust manifold is a real common 
thing, the reason being is that most of us don't use the correct nuts to 
begin with...1st check and see if the thread in the head is still ok (how 
much aluminum came out in the steelstuds?).  If they are, then once you get 
all of them out of the head, just get new studs, double nut them and screw m 
in (maybe get some high temp locktite)...If they are badly stripped...check 
the archives around the PITA job of rethreading and possible inserts 
(&quot;Timeserts&quot; are good).  When you finally get them in...USE THE COPPER SELF 
TIGHTENING EXHAUST STUD NUTS... that are available at you local VW Flaps. 
They are a softer metal and will NEVER freeze on the steel studs.
Good Luck...
