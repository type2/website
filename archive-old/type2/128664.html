Subject: Rust Under the Windshield

I need someone to check my Supposition...
I ran across a decent bus, but with rust through under the windshield. The
person said it was ok, since no water makes it into the cabin or on his
feet. I thought that that area below the windshield was double-walled, so
that water getting in there, does not actually go in the cabin, But does
go where you do not want water to sit(in there with no path to drainage).

Am I correct in this, or am I wrong. My thought is if water has been
gathering in there, I do not want the bus because it is a problem waiting
to rust-through.

Thanks,
Matt
