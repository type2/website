Subject: Windshield repair (more)

In the final picture of Richard Atwell's excellent windshield repair,

http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/WindshieldRepair.html

the seal clearly terminates 1/8&quot; to 3/16&quot; short of the actual lip. My 
seal, however, overlapped this lip. I don't know whether this was 
because the seal was incorrectly seated or because there is variability 
in the way these seals fit.

This makes a difference in how I do the repair. If there's variability 
in the way these seals fit, some of them go all the way to or overlap 
the lip, then the repair is going to be much easier than if that 1/8&quot; 
bit of sheet metal needs to show.

Any thoughts on this?
