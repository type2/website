To the very good advice from Jeff S. I would add this: get a copy of Ron 
Fournier's book on metal fabricating (there are two; one of them is 
co-authored by his wife Sue).

As you learn to weld, also try hammerforming with body tools and a shot 
bag. Don't expect your early work the be worth much; this takes some time 
and practice. 

There are very few body panels on a bus that can not be hand-fabricated 
if you have the patience to learn. By the time you can turn out a good 
replacement panel, you'll be ready to move on to the bus itself. Steel 
isn't cheap, but it is way less expensive than proprietary repair panels.

For a couple of thousand dollars, and a couple of years' work, you can 
not only end up with a smooth bus, but a nice set of skills and a 
well-equipped shop to boot.

It's the way to go.

Mark
