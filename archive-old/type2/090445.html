Subject: wood screws

Elmer's glue in the hole. Stick a tootpick in and
break it off flush. Screw in the wood screw and let
sit
for a while.
 Use the flat wood toothpicks. It partially fills the
hole and gives the screw something to bite into and
the
elmers will act like loctite on a metal to metal
screw.

If this fails, get some wood putty.. fill the hole
with the putty and then install the screw. Make sure
no stress is put on it untill the putty setup time has
passed.

Hardcore fix... 2 part epoxy in the hole and install
the screw... dont plan on getting it out though.
-------------------
I want to put the lids back on but the screw holes in
the plywood are
&quot;stripped&quot;.  The threads on the screws weren't too
heavy duty but 
there's noting to hold the screws in the holes now
except sawdust.

For you wood working pros out there, what's the best
way to &quot;fix&quot; the 
holes
so the screws catch?
