The Camping World catalog has portable refrigerators and
refrigerator/freezers, but the prices are pretty steep.

The least expensive is a Dometic portable reefer [with wheels, even] that
runs on 12V DC / 110V AC / propane.  Capacity is 35 litres - price is
$399.00.

The least expensive refrigerator/freezer is a 12V DC / 24V DC / 120V AC unit
with a capacity of 1.38 cubic feet.  Price is $899.00!

FWIW.....

In the auto section of my local paper there is an article about a 12v
fridge. It lists a web site. www.fridgefreeze_dot_com  NOT cheap!!  but it is a
real refridgerator/freezer.
