Subject: Steel brake line

I have an 81 aircooled 2.0 FI Westy.  After buying it, rebuilding the engine,
and finally getting it running, I found out I have a broken brake line.  It's
the line coming from the front of the van suppling the rear breaks.  Does
anyone know the size of the steel brake line?  It was dark out and at a quick
glance it looked to be about 7mm or smaller.  Does this sound right?  Any
place to get a replacement online or am I better off going to a local parts
store for an item like this?

Thanks,

Mike
