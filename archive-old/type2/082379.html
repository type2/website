Subject: Jack Stands

I always feel a little unsafe when I have the bus up on jack stands, even
though my stands are rated for more than twice the weight of my bus.  For me
it is a question of stability more than weight bearing capacity.  I always
put some 4x4 wood blocks under the frame for backup (belt &amp; suspenders), but
I still get an uneasy feeling while I am underneath working away.  
	Any listmembers ever try modifying a set of jack stands so that they
would fit into the jack points?  I have seen high-lift jacks that fit into
the jack points (very cool, but a bit out of my price range), but never a
set of jack stands made for this purpose.  The only problem I can forsee
with this design is that it would change the center of gravity over the jack
stands if you were to simply weld a tab to the top of a standard jack stand,
maybe not enough to present a problem, but again, I would rather err on the
side of caution.  Obviously you could fix the center of gravity by using a
45 degree angle away from the bus (make a bend that looks like a 7 on top of
the straight shaft) to center the weight over the stand, but this would
require some pretty heavy duty fabrication skills.  What does everyone
think, could this be a better / safer alternative to regular jack stands?  I
know I would feel better with 4 of these holding my bus up at comfortable
working height...
