Subject: it runs!!!!!  (65 camper)

... again.    

new tranny boots,  popped the motor in on saturday.  then today i spent
entierly too much time trying to sort out a muffler for the beast.  it came
with a header system, the muffler bit had rusted out, but the tube half was
fine.  i loosened the bolts to remove it, but left it on until i decided what
the solution was.   

1) do i have a good complete bus muffler around?
2)   &quot;&quot;      &quot;&quot;&quot;   a good header muffler tip?
3)  something else?

turns out that mike went and took the muffler off (why?  )  which made me a
lot of extra hassle (bitch moan whine).   must have been on there good, as he
mashed the tube pretty well with the hammer, it looks like.   i tried to
unmash it, but it refused.   and there was no  good stock bus muffler around.
  i spent entirely too much time finding a suitable exhaust, which i patched
together from two, to each of which i took the angle grinder  in order to
destroy the bolts holding the muffler to the tubes.   of course the tubes, as
these headers types tend to not do,  did not line up well at all with the
motor.  finally i overcame, and there it was.     yippee!
changed the voltage regulator too.  the light had glowed when you stepped on
the gas, but not at idle, and the battery was weak.  and changed the tire
that went flat.

drove it out of the garage, and washed it  :)     there were things growing
on the roof.     now the bus looks happier.    and there is  no light glowing
on the dash.   but it turns out there IS an exhaust leak  :(   must fix  that
 tomorrow.

i sanded off the rear window ledge, and sprayed that extend stuff. (i put
cardboard behind the window space, so as to not muss the interior)    it gets
paint tomorrow, and i hope it dries quickly enough to have the window in  so
i can go to the junkyard for roof wood in the afternoon.
