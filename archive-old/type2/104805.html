Subject: Re: [T2] rebuilt 2L heads? where?

Avoid AVP heads for the type 4 engine. (Bus Depot sells AVP). I just got
done with a $830 Head R&amp;R on an AVP rebuilt engine with  15,000 miles on it.
Failure because AVP seems to not understand how to rebuild heads properly.
Warranty 12K miles, failure 15K miles and AVP's reply was &quot;so sorry, out of
warantee, not our problem&quot; ( like GEX's modus operandi). I have heard other
negative remarks about AVP's rebuilt heads from other list members too.

So, I would go with your locally available heads or get new AMC (Spanish)
heads ($350.ea) because replacing them is so labor intensive that it doesn't
pay to scrimp on marginal parts

As always, your mileage may vary..... there are many listmembers who have
positive things to say about AVP.... but my (single) experience has been
negative.

If you do buy AVP rebuilt heads...be sure to remove the valves and inspect
them thoroughly and not be afraid to return them if you find Assymetry in
the cut of the valve seats, cracking around the valve guide bosses under the
valve heads, helicoil repairs of rocker arm assembly studs or spark plug
inserts..... mine had all of these on one cylinder (#1) and the exhaust
valve failed and burned at 15K miles.
