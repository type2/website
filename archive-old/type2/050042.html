Subject: [T2] Single Solex?

I have a single Solex carb on my 74 Westy, 1.8.
Where can I find info on this carb/conversion?  It really needs some
tinkering as I feel it could run a little better than it does.  It runs
very rich and my gas mileage is horrible.
Is there any info on the web anywhere dealing with this specific
conversion?

Thanks,
