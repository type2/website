Volks -

I have an A/C unit off of my 77 for sale for best offer.
I don't know if it works, but I assume that it does.
It is missing the compressor but has all of the other
parts.  Hopefully someone can make some use of it.
I took special care when I removed it to see to it that 
everything remained in good condition.

Email me privately if you're interested.
Trades are possible too.
I'm in So Cal.
