Subject: Type 4 Engine Pull

Hi All:
A couple of months back, I'd helped with the engine pull and reinstallation
on a 74 automatic and found that the lack of clearance behind the engine
makes it damn difficult to remove/install the engine with the transmission
in place (like you'd do it in a B**tle).  So earlier this week, in
anticipation of replacing heads on my 79 westy, I solicited advice from the
list to determine the easiest way to remove/install the type 4 engine.  I
received several responses (thanx list) basically recommending either
removing or replacing the engine/transmission together or
removal/replacement with the transmission in place.  In any case, I (along
with my faithful slave Pedro) removed the engine on my 79 last night and
thought I'd chance becoming flame bait and add my opinion.

We pulled the engine by lowering the engine and transmission together until
the engine cleared the lower rear of the car, then separated the engine
from the transmission.  Once the engine was separated, we hung the tranny
back up on its mounts so the car could be rolled around.  This took between
2.5 to 3 hours for two relative novices, about an hour of which was removal
and tagging of the wiring harness (FI).  This approach does not require
removing CV joints from the tranny, but I did disconnect the shift linkage
so the tranny could drop downward enough for the engine to clear the rear
end.  I like this approach because you don't have to disconnect the clutch,
starter, ground strap or CVs from the tranny, saving a bunch of work.

Hopefully engine replacement using this method will go as well as the
removal.  In the meantime I hope to have the AVPs heads installed and the
bus back on the road for BBA next weekend.
