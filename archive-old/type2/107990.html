Subject: RE: [T2] Starter current and clutch cable

I could easily see the clutch cable snapping due to current being passed
through it.  It's not made to carry current as it is made of steel.  I
test circuit breakers for a living and believe me, I have seen what
happens when you try to pass any current through steel.  It heats up
faster and hotter than you would imagine.  Remember the starting surge
of current when you first turn the key is sometimes in excess of 200
amps (verified with a fluke scopemeter.)  Enough to turn that clutch
cable into a fuse.  BTW the heating element on an electric range is also
made of steel==&gt; heats when current is run through it.

&gt; I think what's more likely is the best path to ground for whatever
reason
&gt; was the clutch cable and the current snapped it. Right?
