Noticed a new jack at Costco the other day.  It's marketed as being for
ATV's and golf carts, but it sure looks like it would work well for pulling
the engine out of a bus or bug.  It's low with two lifting arms, kind of
like a small high-lift pallet jack.  Have any experienced VW folks seen it,
and do you think it will work for an engine pull?  Price is ~$95.00.
