Howdy All!!
I have just finished parting out a 76 Westy and i have a ton of parts for sale.  I wanted to offer them to the list before I list them on that big evil auction site where I expect to make an obscene amount of money!.  So, I will offer them up here now, and anything left by the end of the week goes to the previously mentioned auction site. All items are in good used condition. I have:  instrument gage cluster (including the ever elusive VDO quartz clock!) 2 interior front door panels (dark green, classic mid-70's Westy, includes clips), door component from both front doors (armrests, interior handles, window cranks),  mattress with original Westy plaid upholstery for top bed (classic orange, yellow, green plaid in excellent un-faded condition with westfalia-werke tag still on it!), dash board (no cracks, splits, etc.), Westy latching cabinet handles (set of 4, all working in good shape except one which is cracked but still works), front nose spare tire mount, dash switches (inc!
!
luding headlight, hazard), a large crank out louvered side window (good working condition), rear hatch window glass (with defroster imbedded), latch for pop-top, front seat belts with shoulder harness, water tank and sink with electric pump (needs a good sanitizing, but otherwise good), front section of top bunk with hinges (this is the wooden part under the mattress that flips over to create top bunk), wiper\turn signal switch assembly, wiper motor and fixtures (everything but the arms and the blades), a mosquito net for the rear hatch (a little stained but in like-new condition otherwise)... and various other parts too numerous to list, email with your needs and a reasonable offer and I'll ship them today!  I will also have photos available for emailing after tonight (monday)



Peace, John Baker
