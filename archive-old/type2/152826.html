Subject: Re: [T2] type 2 register dot com bug found

Bug wasnt listed in the email - but was it that fact that when you are
creating a new album - and you click &quot;example&quot; - that the page that opens
(new window) is &quot;about:blank&quot; :)

Or is that a new one ...

BTW coming from a web designer, you did a really great job on the site, I am
assuming you are using a database? I am still definately impressed - I may
have to talk with you - once my &quot;Riviera
registry&lt;http://rivieraregistry_dot_com&gt;&quot;
get a little more popular - I am only adding them by hand (HTML/CSS).

GREAT JOB!!!
