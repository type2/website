Never, ever, take a car to AAMCO. AAMCO in Irving
Texas disassembled my transmission under the guise
of a FREE inspection. $550 later (in 1975) I had a
transmission again. I warn everyone not to go to
AAMCO. My experience is not unique. Other friends
have shared similar stories about AAMCO dishonesty.
The tranny was worn, and probably needed new fluid,
but it did not need a complete and very expensive
overhaul.

&gt; Locally the AAMCO is advertising &quot;free auto tranny check, bring your's in
&gt; for free checkup&quot; and the visual is someone carrying in a transmission and
&gt; ploping it on the counter, welllllll, I have a dead auto tranny sitting in
&gt; the garage,  ;8*}}}}}}}}

Remember what they used to say in another tranny place's commercials???

&quot;50% of the transmissions brought to us do NOT need a rebuild.&quot;

Or something to that effect...  Seemed like an awfully high percentage
of total rebuilds...  Scammy.
