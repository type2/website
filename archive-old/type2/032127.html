Hi, Chuck-- 

This is definitely white-grey.  And, this being Oregon where the rainy
season officially ends on July 5, water condensation does sound like a
likely candidate.

&gt; one other thought is it could be running a little rich. Does it only happen 
&gt; in the morning when its damp? Run a finger in the tailpipe and see if its 
&gt; sooty(rich) or oily(burning a little oil) or is it a nice grey(just fine)

What with one thing and another, I haven't driven it a lot since the new
engine went in [and that's killing me, believe me!], but yes, generally
it's been damp around here in the mornings.  Just went out and checked the
tail pipe and it's a little sooty.  Thanks!
