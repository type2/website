Subject: Re: Observations on Bus Owners Driving Techniques 

    &gt; And so a closing question. Am I the only one who drives like I've
    &gt; been pithed? Do most of you folks &quot;baby&quot; your rigs, never coming
    &gt; near red-line, for any reason? Never exceed 60mph? Now I'm very
    &gt; curious...

Pithing toads for science -- takes me back!

Anyhow, I never ever go above 70 though I do draft semis occasionally.
