&gt;Much as I usually disdain much of what is sold at &gt;Radio Shack, I was suitably shocked at the sound &gt;quality of their Linaeum-tweetered small &gt;speaker...More so when they were 50 per cent off. &gt;When they go on sale again, I think I'll try and &gt;figure out a way to wire them into my Bus...8 ohms &gt;though...tsk.
By virtue of a different hobby (speaker building), I already knew about these terrific-sounding speakers.  It so happens that the Linnaeum monopole tweeter (subjectively rated much better than the dipole) is available from Radio Shack as a replacement item (RS #11086147 at about $15 ea) for those who want to integrate them with the other speakers you may already have/build.  OBTW - the tweeters themselves are 6 ohm.
