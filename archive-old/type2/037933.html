Subject: WOO HOO!!!

Hello everyone,
	This is purly a gratuitous post and a compliment fishing trip, but I feel
so good, I have to do it.  At the end of February I purchased a '75 camper
that I decided would be my project bus.  I have been wanting to delve into
the wonderful world of VW ownership for quite a while, and knew that with my
meager funds, a project would be all that I could afford.  What a project it
has turned out to be!
	First the good news.  I got the bus for a mere $350!  The engine actually
ran, well sort of anyway.  I didn't trust it in the least, so my dad and I
towed it home on our flat bed trailer. I decided to name it Nanook after the
great white polar bear, as this was hopefully going to be my next ticket
back to Alaska, and because it was white.  The bad news:  The PO had even
less idea about how to care for the aging machine than I did, and have never
owned a VW before!  All I can say about what I had to initially work with
was &quot;BLECH! What a MESS!&quot;
	Long story short:  MASSIVE reasearch on my part, including the imminently
helpful and wonderful people who post to this list, stripping of that
horrible Weber Progressive, replacement of the valves this carb burned,  and
acquisition, rebuilding, and doo-dading (all the &quot;optional&quot; solenoids, etc.)
of a beautiful (I know, I know, suggestive) set of Solex PDSIT carbs and a
vaccuum advance 012 dizzy.  This is really glossing over the pain and
frustration involved in just getting the TIN off this silly thing!  I must
have used 3 cans of WD-40 and ruined 3 screwdrivers trying to get that stuff
off!  Each time I learned something new, I seemed to need to add a part.
Thanks go to the No Name Garage here in Eugene, without which, I would be
out a very large sum of money trying to get new bits and pieces, instead of
getting fine used parts for free or a little bit of nothing.
	Anyway, I think now, except for the emmisions stuff (EGR, ECP etc.), I have
everything attached correctly in the engine.  In fact, I know, because it
idles nicely, has power, doesn't bog down at strange times, and is even
timed correctly!  Today, and this is why I am excited, after two months of
work (OK, only 2 days a week, but still) I GOT TO DRIVE MY BUS!!!!!  I
couldn't have been happier.  I think every car that passed me on my short
trips up and down the road around my house could see my teeth shining like
the Cheshire Cat!  It really pays to be careful and do things right!  WOO
HOO!
	Ok, now I am done ranting.  I still have TONS of work to do, and some I
can't do myself, even with the help of my father and his extensive tool
supply.  The body is the next step.  here I get to say &quot;BLECH! What a MESS&quot;
all over again.  It is a bit more rotted than either of us realized when we
bought it. Oh well, I am not about to give up now!

Thank you for listening,
