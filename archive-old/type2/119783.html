Subject: cv boots

While under the bus today I noticed I ripped a boot or 2.  (This was after ripping my arms apart trying to get my heater cable out of the tube!)  Anyway,  I looked in the Bentley and can't really get a grasp on how difficult of a job this is.  I've seen it done but never myself done the whole job.  Question is, is it easy enough to take the shafts out to do or shall I get the boots that screw on without taking the shafts off?  Or are these crappy? The shafts look easy to get off but the boots look hard to get on.  I apologize for what is probably a dumb question or a common topic!  I did search the archives but can't really isolate anything.
Any help would be appreciated!  -Chris 73 Westy
