Subject: missing tin?

a little help would be appreciated with some possible missing tin. an
old guy had a look at my bus after it had been painted, 71 bus by the
way, and told me the &quot;hanger tin was missing&quot; i didn't get a chance to
look or ask him exactly which piece that was! since i am getting ready
to install a fresh rebuild, i thought it wise to replace everything that
the po thought unnecessary-basically everything!
Happy Thanksgiving!
