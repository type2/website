tom-
welcome. to find the # on your distributor,
you will  have to remove it with #1 set
at top dead center ( the rotor points to the
notch in the rim of the base )so that it will go back in
correctly. the # you need is around the base
and quite likely around the back. if you remove
it with the clamp tightened, you will only have to
cog it to replace it. otherwise, if you loosen that
clamp, you will lose your current adjustment.

you may prefer the other method- use a small mirror and
read the numbers upside down and backwards .....

the bentley or this list will confirm the # for you...
