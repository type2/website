Subject: what I hate about buses

What hate most is the &quot;critical needs detector circuit&quot;.

This morning, I needed to get to the beach.  As a result, the bus, which
has been performing well for months and just got an oil change and tune
up... won't start.  It has been raining here for the last 24 hours, and
the ground is a bog.  I *don't* want to crawl under the bus!  I just want
to go to the beach and for traffic reasons, I would like to leave before
noon and *have* to leave before 2:30 or else spenbd 3-5 hours in traffic
instead of 2 1/2 hours.

crank bus, no dice,
battery may be low? put on charger, let it sit and charge for 2 hours,
crank, no dice,
pull out drop cloth, crawl under bus, install remote starter switch,
put on dwell meter, check dwell (48-53 and bouncing, but it is just
cranking, not running),
pull a spark plug wire, prop it on a screwdriver on block (good spark!),
crank, no dice,
pull cap and wires dry in oven, reinstall, (it has been raining)
crank, no dice,
notice funny thump from AFM, shit...  broke a valve overnight at rest????
pull plugs, check compressions (130-130-150-140.... WTF??? #3 is
*HIGH*?????), put plugs back in,
crank, no dice, kicks once or twice,
check fuel pressure (42 and fine),
clock passes 2:30PM, traffic jam starts,
crank, starts and runs like a baby.

I HATE the critical needs detector circuit!!!!!!!
See you all on Sunday, I am off to the beach, slowly :-(
