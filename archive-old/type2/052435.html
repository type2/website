&gt; Subject: [T2] lightened flywheels for hill country
&gt; 
&gt; say if a person with a type I- powered bus lived in a very hilly area like
&gt; 
&gt; the ozarks or cascades and did most of their driving there...wouldn't it
&gt; be 
&gt; a benefit to use a 12.5# flywheel with a counterweighted crank?  i realize
&gt; 
&gt; the stock flywheel would be better for long flat hauls....where i live, 
&gt; there is like five 30 degree hills every mile....

rather opinion!

	I'd be very supprised if the weigh of the flywheel was detectable
WRT going up hills.
	The amount of energy stored in the fly wheel is miniscule compared
to the energy required to 
	lift a 3000 pound bus up any hill.

	Just my uninformed opinion
