Subject: RE: [T2] Anti-Seize


All this torque stuff is starting to make me wonder how I got this
far in life.  I've been removing and replacing engine screens and
mufflers and spark plugs without a torque wrench for decades and
never stripped a thread or had a leak.  Always cleaned the threads
before assembly and smeared on a little wheel bearing grease.  Just
held the socket wrench close to the head and tightened till I felt
the gasket start to crush.  No torque wrench required.

Yes, I have used a torque wrench when replacing a clutch and I would
certainly use one to assemble a long block.  And of course I alway
figure out where to stand on the breaker bar when tightening the
wheel nuts.  But when it comes to spark plugs, mufflers and engine
screen nuts, I think it's best to develop an empathic relationship
with your studs, gaskets and nuts.
