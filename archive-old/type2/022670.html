I would like to have all the codes on the metal plate. I keep a database
of the codes so I can compare them and figure out any unknown codes. Now
I am wondering: what colour-code is mentioned on the m-plate to point
out &quot;Cloud White&quot;?

Hiya Vincent,

I am honored to provide what assistance I can to your work in decoding 
M-plates.  Here is my complete M-plate:

02  224  869  E
697
026 134  D25  026  128  508
24  1  7926  US  2211  21

I hope that helps.  By the way, the paint sticker just below the M-plate 
reads:
Savannenbeige
      L620
Wolkenweis
    L581

Mike
