&gt;Hey hey, I'm at work and on the way home I need to get new battery
&gt;cables for my bus. I'm driving a friends car so I can't just strip 'em
&gt;out when I get their. Anybody know how LONG they're supposed to be?

It depends on the model. 68-71 is one length, 72-74 is another and 75-79 is yet another. The last cable mentioned is the longest at 48&quot;. It's 25mm2 which is about 4 AWG.

&gt;Also, are some cables better than others?

Most of the generic replacement cables are the smaller 6 AWG size. My original cable was in perfect condition, only the terminals had gone bad so I replaced them:
