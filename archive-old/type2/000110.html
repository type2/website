I have only been ripped off once and that was for less than $30.00 and I have 
been sending money to people for car parts for over 30 years.  Most of us are 
 hobbyists that are just trying to help another hobbyist.  There are a few 
ripoff artists but I think they are few and far between.  They are usually 
exposed quickly by the rest of us who are honest.
