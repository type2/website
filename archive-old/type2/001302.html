Subject: What carbs to use
Date: Mon, 1 Jan 2001 20:57:06 -0000

I've managed to get most of the parts I need for the 1776 re-build I'm
doing. My local guy just said &quot;put it on my account &amp; pay the trade price&quot;
err, earth to mars, come in please. Nice guy, what can I say (well I can say
that we pay _at_ least 100% mark up on most items, but everyone needs to make a
living). Enough of parts, I need to fit new carbs to the bus as this will be
an upright engine &amp; the old PIC34/3 is not man enough. My choices are
(unless you think of any others). BTW, I'd love a pair of twins, but a bit
too expensive _at_ £550.

1. Single Weber progressive (not a good option as I understand)

2. Twin Kadrons, I almost got a pair of these _at_ Vanfest but decided to build
the lump first. Have been told that spares are not easily available (U.K).

3. Twin Webers, good name &amp; spares reliable

Any views on the above are welcome, I did consider getting the twin dell's
from an AlfaSud, but I need to get these carbs in &amp; get the bus ready for
long distance as quickly as possible (Baby in May). after rebuild kits,
gaskets, linkage, filters etc. I only save £200 &amp; although that's a heap of
money I need reliability. I would love to fit a FI kit using CIS from a golf
etc, but again time does not allow (need good measured fuel in the new
engine, experiments = lean = BANG!)
