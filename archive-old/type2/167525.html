Subject: I AM GOING TO SCREAM!!!!!!! or cry

78 auto tranny two liter, stock.

have been fighting with a bad head for over two months now, finally
arrived last thursday and got everything back together today..  cyl #1
can't get more than 30psi no matter how I set the valves, and this was one
of the &quot;good&quot; cyl before I started it had a solid 125psi before it was
#3&amp;4 that were bad, I just put a pair of heads on to keep em uniform..

got it running finally even with bad cyl, but can't get it to &quot;run&quot; just
sort of barely idles...all known good parts. anyone near Baltimore I think
I need another set of eyeballs looking at it right now, I'm burned out...

ready to buy a smart car or skate board or something...
