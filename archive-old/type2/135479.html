&lt;&lt; That's funny!  But the copyright laws here in the US cover that.  It's up 
to

the copyright holder if they feel that their copyright was violated.  They

could claim (rightfully so) that the intent was to copy the logo, even if it

comes in a number of pieces and has to be assembled.

Colin Chapman (of Lotus cars and racers fame) sold some of the 
original Lotus 7 cars in two &quot;sections&quot; the body and the drivetrain.
Even tho' they were obviously meant to &quot;go together&quot; they were
sold separately for tax purposes...They came with an assembly
manual but even that was named a repair manual... ;-)
If you're curious what a Lotus 7 looks like...Patrick McGoohan
drives one in the opening credits of the cult TV series, &quot;The
Prisoner&quot;... ;-)
