Karl,

I am not sure which switch you have and what you are referring to in the
Bentley manual. I see (Bentley light switch E1) and note that the '71 model
is the same as the '72 and later models. This holding true that, if you have
a '71 bus you use switch 211 941 531 E. The terminals are as follows.

56
58
30 two wire
57 not used in 73 and later
58b
X

The earlier one for '68-'70 is 311 941 531A and is as follows.

58
30 two wires
56
30
30
58b
57

Some parts evolved over the years and never changed part numbers and or some
parts changed numbers and the old parts were never talked about again. If VW
made a 211 941 531 it would have come before 211 941 531 E this makes since.
It is possible that the switch you have is of this nature. But, VW never
talked about it again, meaning it never existed, i.e. the part used is 211
941 531 E. There is no need of confusing the issue any further.

People put anything they could get on these buses to make them work. This
making it hard to pull a part off an old bus and say that it is OEM. This is
a big problem in selling used bus parts, a problem we face and deal with
every day. These correct switches are becoming harder and harder to find.
The aftermarket ones are not quite genuine looking but work well.

Regardless I have stated my opinion and as always hold the list as my
humbling air, no pun intended. I also recognize your enthusiasm and love for
these buses to be as genuine as mine. If you feel that I am wrong, I am
sorry you feel that way. I would not like to further this discussion. If
anyone has a need for these parts we have them as stated before used
switches sell for $21.99 and are OEM new ones sell for $35 and are
aftermarket the are 311 941 531 A fits '68-'70 and 211 941 531 E fits
'71-'79.

Then I have 3 imaginary 211 941 531 PLAIN switches from 71's in my hand!!!!

On the PLAIN switch, the part number is on the black bakelite? surface. On
the E the number is stamped in the case.

Putting a PLAIN switch next to a E switch, there is a BIG difference in the
terminals.  Amount and size.

PLAIN                                                  E
2 - 30                                               2 - 30
1 - 56                                               1 - 56
1 - 57                                               NO 57
1 - 58                                               1 - 58
1 - 58b                                             1 - 58b
NO 58L                                            1 - 58L
NO 58R                                            1 - 58R
1 - X                                                  1 - X
