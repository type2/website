&gt;Again I agree. I was amazed at how much better my engine ran in the winter 
&gt;when I plumbed hot air to the air cleaner, as VW did. But while VW may 
&gt;have had a reason for installing what they did, I don't think everything 
&gt;is necessary. I wouldn't remove the thermostat, for example, but I have no 
&gt;qualms with ditching the throttle positioner and tuning the engine to run 
&gt;without it. VW engineering is bone-simple. It can, and has been, improved 
&gt;upon many times by many people. It took VW years to bring out the doghouse 
&gt;cooler and by that time, some owners had begun auxilliary cooling on their 
&gt;own. So there's no reason to believe VW was perfect.

I think VW was making improvements to meet Fed regs on emissions and noise 
and probably had a limited budget dedicated to the aircooled engines. 
Porsche and Tatra shows what can be done with big $$$, VW limited to low 
cost solutions.

Their changes were cheap and only when necessary. Us enthusiasts are 
willing to spend a little money on our VW's.

Remember a $10 saved on 1 million vehicles is alot of money!!!
