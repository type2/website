Subject: Re: [VB] There here, 55 through 72 front mats



&gt;  60 to 67 front floor mat (these do not have the
&gt; high beam switch hole cut)

Then wouldn't they be 67 mats that need a cutting?

&gt;  these are all made off of NOS matts 

No Toms, Dicks, or Hairy's??

&gt; no the VW part numbers have been removed

Is this because of VWOA? I think that is ridiculous,
if they have a problem with the repo stuff, maybe they
should get in the business.
