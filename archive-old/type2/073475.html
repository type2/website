&gt;As a new, very new owner, what is everyones opinion on body filler?

Bondo is supposed to absorb water.  That said, I've used it in the past
with some success.

&gt;Happy has a tremendous amount of filler, rivited floor panels, but darn
&gt;does she look good.  Is this body work acceptable to the purist?  And
&gt;about the paint scheme, I would like to add a &quot;V&quot; Nose two tone paint
&gt;job in the future.  Is this considered appropiriate to the purist?

Purist?  Who cares what they think?  Do what makes you most happy.
