Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Hose info needed....

Not that unlikely - I had this happen twice on my bus: brakes would not
disengage because the rear half of the brake booster was flooded with water.
Not sure how it got there. Siphoning it out cured the problem.

#4...... maybe, if water etc. went down the hose into the booster, then it
will take the place of air and not allow the diaphragm to return to center,
which in turn will keep the master plunger engaged. Likely? No, the spring
in the booster should push it up the tube.
