Subject: Folly's nuts

Finally I'm to the point where I face the last 6 or so 17mm nuts to 
finally open Folly's type iv case.  I can't believe how tight they are!  
Or else a locktite was use that is still doing its job!  I've only used 
Barry power to try to loosen these nuts, no cheater bar yet.  I just 
wany to make sure that as i face the right side of the motot, the side 
with the nuts facing me, that I have to turn these tough nuts to the 
left to remove, correct??    Any suggestons before I take a cheater to 
the wrench??

Thanks to any and all!
