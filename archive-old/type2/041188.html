Subject: Help locating seal

I need two seals for my 1968 type II. They are the oil seals that go in
the final drive side covers P/N 002 301 189. I have contacted many
suppliers only to here that they can not get them or they are no longer
available. RANCHO, Motorworks and Bus Depot to name a few. The seal
measures 2.840 OD and fits over a 1.888 size axle surface. Any help
would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Steve
