I am having trouble tracking down a lighting bug on my 78. 

When the headlights are turned on the left front turn filament is on full.
The left blinker does not work when the lights are on. When I looked closer
I noticed that the turn filament in all of the remaining lights is on but
very dim. The running light filament is on as normal on all of the lights. I
tracked things around with nothing popping up that looked like a problem
when suddenly everything is OK. Drove around for a few days OK but last
night I found that the problem is back. The obvious area is the flasher
relay but it tests out OK. 

Any Ideas?

Thanks 
Clay
