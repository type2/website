&gt;maybe 3m makes the invisible bra in huge sheets then you could just put

That's the route I'm going to go but I need to wait until the paint cures first.

&gt;You may want to rethink the whole water test thing with the bra on
&gt;if you can avoid it.  I have several friends in various states of
&gt;duress due to leaving their bra's on their vehicles during the rainy
&gt;season.

I took the bra off as soon as I got home. I only wanted to use it on the highway for two days to avoid damage to the nose. Another reason I only wanted to spend $13 on it.

My painter told me not to leave one on permanently until the paint cured anyway.
