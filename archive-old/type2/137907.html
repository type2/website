&gt; Money can't be much of a factor because I think these vehicles are inexpensive to own and provide decent reliability. IMHO if you can't afford a VW you can't afford a car. I can't really think of a less expensive vehicle to operate (beetle not withstanding) other than a motorcycle.

The cost factor is the real reason we chose VW. The multiplying
features of modern cars means more to break and fix. Plus the
disposable philosophy of the current industry doesn't help. The VW
culture was a welcome side benefit of our economic decision.

&gt; Time in a another matter. Working on my friend's 72 bus has made me rethink how easy these vehicles are. When major problems crop up they can really throw you as you hunt down hard to find parts and labor over PO abuses. I've tried using exaggeration to speed along repairs but it only seems to work for posting messages.

Well, that's a point, but I think all vehicle repairs have this factor.

&gt; This list is invaluable for helping people keep these vehicles running, myself included. My bus was a dead corpse 3 years ago and the state it's in today is a direct reflection of help I've received from the list.

You have certainly taken what you've acquired and passed it on for
all, myself included, to benefit from.
