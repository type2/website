This might work for you-
My 78 blocked up on the way to a show a year ago- I pulled the hose to
the tank and let it run into a bucket until it ran clear- half a shot
glass worth of rust silt in the bucket!   Relaced a new filter, was fine
until I replaced it a mo. ago because I drained the tank and pulled the
engine to do a clutch change.  I blew air up the line to make sure it
was clear and heard a sound like a strainer popped off and rolled into
the tank.  Have done about 1000 mi since.

&gt; I have a 1979 Westy with a rusty gas tank. I can go about 100 miles before I
&gt; have to replace the fuel filter. I cut the filter in half and was shocked to
&gt; see all of the rust in there...
