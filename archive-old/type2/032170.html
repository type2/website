&gt; I have this exact same problem - not only does the tent balloon, but it 
&gt; whistles pretty good on the freeway.  I managed to make it a little 
&gt; better by bending the brackets a little more, but I'm just not happy with 
&gt; that solution.  If anyone can answer this, I would be quite a happy 
&gt; camper.

--&gt;  I have this problem on my '75, aggravated by a decayed bit of
weatherstrip on the front of the pop-top.  I bought some 1&quot; thick
self-adhesive foam weatherstrip and applied it to the rear lip of the
luggage rack -- not stock or pretty, but it sure helped.  Noone can see it
up there anyhow.  I'm thinking about getting some Jeep-style hood
hold-downs and fastening them to the sides of the pop top, to pull it down
more snugly -- any thoughts?  Just the weatherstripping alone made a big
improvement in the noise inside the van, at speed.  The problem seems to
be that over the years the pop top has warped a little, making the latch
in the center the lowest point.
