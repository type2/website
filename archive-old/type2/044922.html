Subject: [T2] trip report - AIRS

Well my wife and I just got back from our first ever long trip in our 
yellow 74 westy.  We traveled from our home in Atmore, Alabama to Maryville 
TN to take our daughter back to college.  1109 total miles.  We carried our 
AIRS list for the states of Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee with us, but we 
didn't need to use it.  We left last Thursday morning, and returned home 
this afternoon, Tuesday, August 29, 2000.  I was devastated to read the 
news about Kristin when I caught up on my type 2 reading.

Sunday, on our way back home, we had an encounter with a vehicle that was 
quite a bit larger than us, and it kind of put a damper on our spirits that 
day.  We also had trouble that evening locating a campground.  Up until 
that point we had stayed in three very nice campgrounds, but I never once 
considered calling on an AIRS list person.  Instead, we stayed in a motel. 
 In the future, I may decide to call on an AIRS list person.  I know that I 
will be far more open to the idea of someone camping in my pasture now than 
I was before this trip.  I am also going to carry far better campsite 
locating documents than a map with a green tent by a city name.

Joel Lambert, Atmore, AL  74 westy, 75 bus, 65 type 3 ghia
