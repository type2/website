Hello all,

 This is to let everyone know, despite all of what has gone on the past
week, that the Josh Rodgers Memorial Campout is still on for next weekend.

 It will be held at the Turner Falls Campgrounds, at Davis, Oklahoma. The
cost is $5 per person, per vehicle, per night. Electric hook ups are more
and are on the south end of the upper campgrounds, right as you turn in.

 Directions: From OKC and points north- I-35 south to exit 51, turn right
onto US 77, entrance on your right 1 1/2 miles.

 From Dallas and points south: I-35 north to exit 47, turn left onto US 77,
entrance on your left about 3 miles.

Hope to see everyone there!!!!
