Subject: re: '70 Cold Weather Problem -Timing?

Hi Mike,

I guess as you've got a '70 it must be a carb bus.

Your problem could be the timing but it might be worth checking some of the 
following that could make your engine revs drop when you take your foot off 
the gas pedal to change gear.

1.   Is the choke spring attached or broken? Try flicking the stepped cam on 
     the other side of the carb to see if it returns.

2.   Is the choke set properly? There are some difficult to see marks on the
     choke housing that shows the alignment, but when cold the screw that sits
     on the stepped cam should be on the top step. If its on a lower step then
     the choke will be coming off too soon.

3.   Have you replaced the oil bath air cleaner with a fancy paper thing on 
     top the carb? If so then you will not be getting any pre-heated air into 
     the carb (my bus cut out every time I took my foot off the gas on a cold 
     day before the engine was warm when the tube fell off the air cleaner).
     Put the oil bath back (if you still have it).

4.   Where the pre-heated air pipe goes into the oil bath air cleaner there is 
     a thermostaticaly controled flap to regulate how much hot air goes in.
     Is it working? Is it adjusted properly?

5.   Is the input manifold preheat pipe working correctly? Don't take the 
     muffler off just for this but when changing the muffler it's always worth
     checking that this is clear (I use a 5mm diameter drain cleaning spring 
     for this). One of Bob Hoovers 'Sermons' suggests that some after market
     mufflers dont have the correct internal plumbing for this to work.
     We have on sale over here a heater jacket that goes on the input manifold
     just below the carb to reduce manifold icing. I can send details if wanted,
     but they WILL NOT fit if you have the take off for vacume assisted brakes
     - I tried.

6.   Last but not least have you got a vacuum leak in the joints of the input 
     manifold? Try squirting some WD40 or carb cleaner around the joints to 
     see if the idle changes (as per recent posts).

Having said all that it still could be the timing, but to run 100% everthing
should be right and to adjust one part of the system to cover-up a deficiency
elsewhere is never a good move.

Good luck

Bob
