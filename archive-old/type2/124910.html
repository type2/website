Subject: additional comments about engine stand

I just happened to have an engine upside down on the engine stand to make it
easier to install the exhaust manifolds against the heads.  I didn't want the
oval copper gaskets to fall out. I left the engine upside down and I bolted
all the rest of the exhaust parts together on an upside down engine. I
couldn't rotate the engine after I mounted the heater boxes because they hung
up on the stand. Then I  had to lift up the upside down engine with an engine
lift and get it upright. Then I installed the engine (upright) and I couldn't
get the valve covers off because the heater boxes were too high. The exhaust
parts have some built in slop in the bolt holes. You must allow the heater
boxes to hang down when you install them on an upright engine. So I loosened
everthing, and let the exhaust parts align and hang down according to the
extra slop in the bolt holes. Then tightened everything up and yipee, I could
get the valve covers off easily. So make sure that you have the engine
upright when you bolt on the exhaust parts.
