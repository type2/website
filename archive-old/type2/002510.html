Subject: hot start problem?

Greetings all,

I have a problem starting my '77 Westy when the ambient temperature is warm
to hot.  It starts perfectly well when the weather is cold even after I've
been driving for a while.   (When I say &quot;cold&quot; I mean California coast cold,
say 55 degrees or less).
When I turn the key, I hear a click under the bus, the headlights dim and
nothing else happens.   It does eventually start however, smetimes it takes
a minute, sometimes ten minutes.  All the contacts seem good, the wires are
in excellent shape, the battery cables are clean, and I even have a hot
start rely on the solenoid.   I welcome any ideas anyone would pass along to
me!

Michael Garner
'77 Westy
