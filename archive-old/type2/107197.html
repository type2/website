Thread-Topic: [T2] Reduced power after tune-up

Subject: RE: [T2] Reduced power after tune-up

When I was doing the timing I noticed something interesting but I wasn't
sure if it was important. My timing scale on the fan housing has a
little red dot at 5 degrees. When I checked the timing, it was well on
the other side (to the right) of the zero mark almost past the 5 degree
mark on the other side of the scale. As I turned my distributor to
advance the timing to the red mark, the idle of the engine lowered. As I
read on in my trusty repair manual, it stated that I should check the
timing to make sure that it advanced as I revved the engine, it did not.
Does this mean anything?

sounds like you might not have divined the right timing parameters.
