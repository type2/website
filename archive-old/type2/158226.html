Subject: Coil Question again

Hi All,

My Bus (72 with 76 drivetrain - FI 2000) is STILL
having trouble. I searched the archives and found
someone with the exact symptoms, but only them with
these symptoms. No other listings. So I'm asking has
anyone else had these symptoms when the coil is going
bad: Runs fine, then sometimes looses power at higer
RPM's and under load (going up a hill).  Then it will
be fine again, run well for a while, then back to a
lose of power at higher RPM's. Plus it will stall out
when the it's acting up. All the lights and radio work
fine. Starter cranking fine. The timing is fine. I've
just had a tune up and the distributor rebuilt. These
symptoms was starting to reveal itself before this.
But it's getting worse. Has anyone else had this
happen when the coil is going bad? Does this sound
familiar to anyone? (the #2 thermistat is also new)
FYI - I have a &quot;blue Bosch&quot; coil, about 6-7 years old.


Thanks,

Rae &amp; Rudy Bus '72 w/76 FI 2000cc
