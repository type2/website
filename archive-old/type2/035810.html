Subject: Gas lines and heat

Hello everyone!

I am now the pround owner of a 77 VW poptop camper.
It green and white with very little rust and runs pretty well.
Well try and get photos up soon.

I have alot of questions about what the pervious onwers did,
but since there daughter owned it before them and they were pretty
old they couldnt answer all my questions. So first of is I want
to replace the gas lines. I have a gas leak by the pump and I am
going to install the new pump tommarow so I figured now is a good
time to replace the decaying gas lines.
My question is can I use a gas line that I found a home depot.
It seems just a bit smaller width, I already used a small peice
as a patch and it seemed to run ok still. I was wounding if any
one else have ever used it? and if its ok?

My next question has to do with my heat. The PO installed a 2200cc
engine and they lived in CA and didnt seem to hook back up the
blower for the heating system. 72 up has a blower in the engine
compartment that blows the air through the heater boxes to the
interior right???? I just read about it try to fix my heat
since there is no blower or heat tubes in the engine compartment
I guess it just missing.?
So could you guys try and help set me straight on the way the heat
system is supposed to be setup on this year model.

Alex W,
