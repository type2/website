This past Saturday I had a great VW time in Atlanta, thanks to David Easterwood and a couple of other Atlanta VW heads, and paid them back by walking out on the 
check after our end-of-day beer stop (this is a pre-emptive strike to reduce the time it will take to live it down).

I arrived at David's place at 11am as arranged, except no David.  Alas, I was forced to spend the next 5-10 minutes wandering through his collection of busses, 
including some very interesting stuff I'd never seen in person.  A few minutes later David arrives with Andrew Leverintz (?) in tow - they had just been to a wood supplier 
checking on some correct-grained baltic birch panels for a westy project.  We hung about and chatted, waiting for Ted and Jeff, who arrived around noon in Ted's 65 
Neunsitzer (just like mine, except originally blue instead of green).

We all piled into Dave's 68 doublecab, which moves out right smartly thanks to a 1776 engine.  After a quick lunch at Sonny's Bar-B-Q (I had to give them the history of 
Sonny's) we headed off to junkyard #1.  I have to tell you it was pretty impressive speeding along the interstate keeping up with most of the truly lunatic Atlanta drivers 
in a 30+ year old VW.

Junkyard #1 contained a 65 splitty and a half-dozen bays, and we all set to work.  I had great luck, finding cowl panels, a washer knob (dried out but looks OK), engine 
bay lid hinge, pretty good package tray, visors, cab floor mat, and other odds &amp; ends on the 65.  I also pulled a side step and a couple of VDO gauges off the bays.  
The other guys seemed pretty happy with their finds -- but the real treat was at checkout: I paid under $18 for all the stuff mentioned!

Then it was back in the DC for a ride across town to yard #2.  Bigger yard, but the pickings were less spectacular (for me) -- although I did pull a complete rear bench 
seat off the one split that was there!  (And paid $12 for it).  Dave was amazed - it was a bus he used to drive that he had sold and a subsequent PO then rolled over.

After that we headed back to Dave's place and cleaned up.  I discovered that a bench seat will not fit in the back of my wife's Honda Accord, so Dave offered to bring 
it to me in Jax in a couple of weeks.  We all headed over to a nearby brew &amp; pizza place and downed a pitcher of Newcastle &amp; tasty stuff.  I left around 8, I think -- then 
smacked myself about 30 minutes later on the road back to the in-laws, when I realized I had walked out without paying my tab!!  This after we had earlier heard tales 
of someone doing the almost the same thing after pizza at last year's Jax show.  

Stoned agin.

Other than my beer-addled forgetfulness, it was a great day.  Really enjoyed hanging out with Dave, Andrew, Ted, and Jeff -- and hope they'll feel free to hang out if 
they're ever near Tallahassee.  Looks like I'll be buying rounds for at least one of them in Jacksonville Beach....
