&gt; Volks,
&gt;
&gt; Last night, I discovered an unconnected wire dangling about in the engine
&gt; compartment (recent rebuild).  It is grey, the unconnected-end has a
&gt; three-prong attachment (bent, incidentally), and it appears to be attached
&gt; to something below the air intake distributor, to the firewall (tin).  I can
&gt; only reach it by jamming my hand beneath the AFM and snaking towards (&amp;
&gt; below) the gas tank.

Can you follow the other end? Does it go up to the white plastic box in the top
right corner of the engine hatch area?
If yes, it is the crank sensor connector for the VW tester. Pay no attention to
it. [ground wires are brown.....]
