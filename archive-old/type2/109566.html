&gt; ... and I feel that there are a bunch of vendors posting and wondered if
they are supporting us in return...

Not yet.  Our bus-related projects are just coming into production, and I
lost 6 weeks due to illness early this year.  I'm struggling to put food on
the table and keep the shop operating at present, but when things even out
and there's money to pass along I'll be more than happy to send something.
:O)

... and I get to put our first production sliding door handle into our bus
tomorrow!
