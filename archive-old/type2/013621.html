Subject: 4th of July Trip Question (long)
From: &quot;Simon Ramirez Jr.&quot; &lt;carapace_at_onebox_dot_com&gt;
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

We finally took Speedy on the long road trip from San Jose to Orange
County with our two kids, and 2 loaner kids (niece and nephew.)  I had
replaced the engine seal, adjusted the valves, and replaced all the fuel
lines.  I had two spare dizzys, spare coil, carb, voltage regulator,
clutch cable, throttle cable, barrel nuts, gaskets, etc.  I thought I
was prepared.  Kust in case, we went the 101 route.  
It went pretty well, until we hit Ventura below Santa Barbara.  My starter
succumbed to the heat.  Man this was the last thing I thought of bringing.
Well, I gave it the ol' technical tap while the wife cranked the engine,
and she fired up.  We arrived at the inlaws after that jsut fine.  In
the morning, I went to start her up for a de-bug wash, and it was dead.
 I called the PO (we're good friends) and he told me the starter was
the original!  Oh well, not that bad of a loss.
Replaced the starter, and headed out to San Pedro.  Man, I've never seen
so many bay window busses in my life.  They seem to be everywhere down
here!  
So here's the question: is there a way to prevent the heat soak effect
from a long road trip on the alternator and starter?  I've read the archives
on a hard start circuit, but I'm not so clear on what it does, and how
it really helps.  

Thanks,

Simon Ramirez Jr.
