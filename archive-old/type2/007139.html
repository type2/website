Well my time has finally come, I am moving back to Minneapolis so therefore must
get off the bus list.  I thank everyone that has helped me with my problems to
make my bus a happy bus. I just got done putting on new cv joints and it runs
so much better, no more clanking noise.  I hope to rejoin the list in the
future for it is a good source of information and good stories. I say thanx
again for all the help.
