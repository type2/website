&gt; 1  If I use shims at the cylinder barrel/case joints to adjust

Here is what one of my heads on my 79 looked like.

you can make out the lighter band where the mating surface is. It's
not completely round. It is supposed to be :) That elipse is where the
head ring had managed to move to. I'm pretty sure that any of the list
vendors carry them. There was a VW tech bulletin that talks about
removing the gaskets and making up the difference below the barrels. I
can't put my hands on it right now, perhaps someone else has the url

&gt; 2.  What kind of treatment are the heads likely to require in order to 
&gt; get them to seal properly?  Will the old trick of lapping the cylinders 
&gt; to the head with valve grinding compound be adequate?

I have had good results with this method.
 
&gt; 3.  What is the most recent wisdom regarding re-torquing heads at some 
&gt; point after the engine has been in service?  This was not done with 
&gt; these heads and I am wondering whether re-torquing would have prevented 
&gt; my situation.

Sure seems like a good idea to me. however Mark Dearing puts locktite
on the head studs after the initial torque, and doesn't do a retorque.
Quite frankly with as many motors as Mark works on/sees if it works
for him it will work for 90% of the people out there.
