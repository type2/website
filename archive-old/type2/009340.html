Leslie:

Most of the publications we have studied on oil temperatures for air cooled
engines indicate that 180F to 220F is the best temperature range to be in.
230F is not too bad for the freeway.  270F is too high.  You might want to
check your timing and compression.  Adding a second oil cooler is also an
option.

 

Thank you!

&gt; I have a 1980 Vanagon air cooled Westy. I installed a Stewart Warner oil
&gt; temp guage and the sending unit screws into the drain plug. I usually
&gt; consider that at 230 it is time to slow down and feel comfortable with
any
&gt; reading below that. Does anyone else run a Stewart Warner or other good
&gt; quality guage? I would appreciate hearing from others as to their average
&gt; temperature. Is 270 too hot and a danger to the engine? Do I have the
&gt; sending unit in a good place to represent the actual oil temp? Tia,
