Yep,
PPG's Concept base / clear.
Lays on super flat using the Binks # 7 gun.
Shines like no tomorrow.
And if you take the time to rub, buff, and polish it looks 4 feet deep.
And is Uv resistant, as well as solvent resistant, and will outlast the
stock paint 10 fold--

Later,

Terry

Can anyone recommend a highly durable paint that is worth putting on a
VW bus? Something that might be like the original in color and
durability? Jan B
