Subject: Passing the baton

Listvolks,

I just got back from Sweetwater, TN, home of the Lost Sea, one of world's 
largest underground lakes.  My daughter, Emma, and I made a side trip there 
after exchanging the baton (and pleasantries).

Anyhoo, I met Skip, his wife, and his bus at a Mickey D's just off I-75 where 
we ceremoniously passed the baton (we shoulda toasted the occasion with a nip 
of miner's coffee -- DAMN!).

Sorry for hanging on to it for so long.  Glad to have been a part of it.  
Happy to see it on its way.  Hope to hear more from everyone as it progresses 
through the lower 48 (and to points beyond).  Hats off to you, Leo.  You done 
good!
