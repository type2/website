Hi Matt,
	0.1 amp will most definitely drain your battery.  Tape up those
connections to keep them apart and insulated.  I use a battery charger
specially designed for low useage vehicles.

This keeps your battery in good shape without overcharging it and
de-sulphates it too.  As I understand it the sulphation is generally what
causes a low use battery to lose a cell.  The sulphate builds up on the
bottom of a cell until it shorts out the plates.  It is really nice to go
out to my bus and have it start no matter how long it has been sitting.  
Well worth the money IMHOP. jon

ps there are other brands that do similar things.  I did a bunch of online
research and th RV folks, who are really anal about their batteries, gave
this brand a good rep. j

but do start it on a  regular basis and it has been starting first time no
problem and battery has never given any signs that it is on the way out,

I did notice however that the two leisure battery straps (not connected to
a
battery)where touching.  When I tested the two by putting them throu the
tester it showed a reading of 0.10 Amps.  Does anyone know if this may
have
been what drained the battery?  It seems unlikely that something so low
would completely drain my battery but do you think that it may have been
draining more when the battery was fully charged?
