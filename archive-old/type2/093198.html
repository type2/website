Huhwhaaaa?  No wonder she's having problems.  The stock Bosch alternator is 
cooled internally by an air duct routed to the fan housing.  A different 
alternator in that spot would quickly overheat, not to mention that the tin 
is probably not present to seal the engine compartment so her engine is 
likely running hot as well.  I'm sorry she's having trouble, but jeez... 
who put that alternator in there?  Thank goodness she is skilled enough to 
have realized the problem and worked around it.
