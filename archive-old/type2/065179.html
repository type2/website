Subject: Re: Need '82 vanagon parts

&gt; I also have an '84 with a automatic transmission that doeesn't like to go
into reverse wheen 
&gt; it's cold.  I'm thinking about converting it to a standard once I get a
fuel injection problem 
&gt; fixed. I'd like to find a standard tranny and enough parts to allow me to
convert. Is there a 
&gt; five speed that will fit this beast? I know I'll need the clutch pedal
assy, clutch master cyl. 
&gt; shift assy w/ linkage etc... I believe I may also need to replace the
halfshafts if they're 
&gt; different lengths. 
&gt; 
&gt; Am I crazy to consider this?

Not if I am not crazy considering changing my 4 sp manual '82 to an auto.
Maybe we should swap? Why don't you like your auto apart from the reverse
business?
