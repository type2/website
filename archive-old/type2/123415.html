Subject: Engine wires?

Greetings,

'79 2.0 L FI going into a '78 - both Westfalias

Ok so I didn't label everything when I took the engine out... I was perhaps 
a bit over confident and told myself I had done the job enough times and 
knew enough not to...  I almost pulled it off...

only two wires - Both Black - Both Left side of engine compartment.  This 
harness was spliced in from the 79. The 78 had a fire years ago(melted 
wires), PO.

Wire #1  -  A thicker one comes out of an in line fuse holder (reverse 
Lights, I think) and goes to where? + side of coil? Or wire harnes for all 
the rear lights.

wire  #2  -  black, comes out of the same harness as the wire above but 
before the fuse and smaller. Where does this go? To the coil + or the wire 
harness for all the lights?

I've stared at the Bentley wire diagrams for both '78 &amp; '79 ad it looks like 
the diameter of these wires changed, which matters little in my case. 
Everything is '79.

However, I THINK I have figured out that the larger wire (#1) goes to the 
coil. And the smaller goes to the lights. I'd love to hear someone agree.

On a side note , but related, these wires in my '79 went to a sort of switch 
mounted in the spare tire well. 6 years and I never even noticed it. The 
switch looks like the locks on vending machines, the kind that take the 
stubby round keys. The switch is accessed/turned from inside the closet. 
What did this do? Ignition lock out for anti-theft protection? I think the 
smaller wire above (wire #2) went to it and the other wire that came out of 
the switch went to + of coil.

Many thanks,
Brandt
