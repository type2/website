Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarkey wheels for a Bay

&gt; unfortunately there appears to be a practical maximum amount of air that
&gt; can be pushed thru the cooling ducts, beyond that little additional
&gt; cooling seems to take place, on a type IV engine this seems to be between
&gt; 55-60mph for a stock setup.

Bob
I dont think the size of the duct openings is the limiting factor.
With a T4 engine since the fan is bolted to the crank you have fixed air
for any rpm. Im sure you could graph the parameters which would show why
55-60 seems to be optimum.
With a T1 you can tweak the airflow by making small changes in the pulley
ratio which is cool. (literally) :)
