Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line size

The fuel hose I needed was indeed 10mm I.D.  I was able to get a section of hose
from the MB dealer for nothing. I told the guy what it was for and he said don't
worry about it.

&gt; This is ONLY on 75 to 79 USA buses with a typeIV engine and fuel injection.[and
&gt; the very rare 74 Calif 1800 w/auto trans]  The filter is 7.5mm on the inlet side
&gt; and 10mm on the outlet side. The fuel pump is 10mm on the inlet side and 7.5mm
&gt; on the outlet side.
