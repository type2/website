Are you SURE that you kept the brake fluid reservoir FULL throught
the bleeding (ie: forcing NO air into the system)?  Perhaps one of the
metal brake fluid lines was/got cracked, and is leaking.  Check
*everything* carefully for leaks--wouldn't be the first time.

&gt;I need to find new ends for my drag link Now, are these ends the 
&gt;same as the tierod ends? If so, which?  Inner or outer?

Unfortunately, it's not quite as easy as that.  You will need to get a
new drag link--comes complete with the ends. I got mine from
Cal Import, only took three days to arrive.  Of coarse, this was before
the beginning of the Annual American Consumer Feeding Frenzy. 
Who knows how long it will take now, with the mails and package 
delivery systems bogged down with holiday cheer. 8{
