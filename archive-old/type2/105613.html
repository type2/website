Subject: Transmission Rear Seal

Nestled behind the throw-out bearing, queitly minding its own business, was 
the transmission oil seal.  Could I leave it alone?  No, of course not.

Now this thing has become the very BANE of my existence.

Would anyone be so kind as to share with me the secrets of removing this 
stubborn seal?  It's driving me nuts....

'78 Bus with 2.0L Type IV manual transmission.

Thanks in advance.

Your humble servant,

Beth in Houston
