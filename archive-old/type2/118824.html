Subject: oil lines to mechanical oil pressure gauge freeze solid

&gt;Subject: RE: [T2] mechanical oil pressure gauge

&gt;My oil pressure is 60 psi at idle on startup in sunny SOCAL. I'd go with
the
&gt;100 psi, unless you know the 60 psi gauge can take 60+ psi without being
&gt;damaged (or relieving excess pressure onto your shag carpet or something).
&gt;
&gt;I's also throw out the comment that 20' is a long way to run the supply
line
&gt;for that. The wires from an electric sender are much less likely to spring
a
&gt;leak.

I ran a mechanical oil pressure gauge oil line on a bug a long time ago.

I worked real hard to run the delicate oil pressure line where it would
never get crushed or bent or hit by road debris and cut open. I didn't want
any oil leaks and I didn't want to run my engine out of oil.

The setup was worthless in the winter . When it got down to 20' F, the gauge
would not show any oil pressure for 30 minutes after an overnight cold
start.

I left the oil line in, and changed over to an electrical oil pressure guage
with no problems .

I always wanted to find a good alternate use for that oil line to make up
for my wasted time, but I never did.  Go with an electric oil pressure gauge
and on the engine oil pressure sender.
