you don't really have to pull the engine to get at the gas tank.

strip the top of the engine and you can get in there.

however it may be easier to drop the engine though

&gt; Folks,
&gt; I'm going to pull my engine in my 78 T2 standard trans tomorrow so I can
&gt; then pull the gas tank and clean it out.
&gt; 
&gt; Since it's been a looong time(17 yrs) since I pulled this type of engine
&gt; does anyone have any special hints? For either the engine or the gas tank
&gt; pull?
&gt; 
&gt; The Bently manual seems to be kinda weird on the subject(late model
&gt; engines).  Basically, pull the engine, move it back a few feet and start
&gt; on the gas tank.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you really have to remove the shield above the muffler(on the body) as
&gt; the Bently manual states?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, dave
