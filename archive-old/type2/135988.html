Subject: Re: [T2] URGENT: drying the air-oil filter

&gt; I have the filter hooked up to a hair dryer as I speak (which, btw, smells
&gt; real nasty). How long is this going to take? What are the risks of not
&gt; drying it thoroughly and hooking it up long enough to move it from my
&gt; driveway to the curb across the street? I need to get my butt to work
&gt; shortly, so I am a bit panicked.

I myself would not worry about running the engine for a small amount
of time w/out an air filter. I'd not run it long just to be on the
safe side. You could if really worried about it take a piece of panty
hose and rubberband and make a makeshift filter over the carb throat.
