good call mark!!
actually my sliding door has a dome light contact switch on it, as far as
the rear cargo hatch(tailgate) JC Whitney, sells mercury tilt switches which
would mean as soon as the hatch was opened the mercury would close the
circuit thus making ________ (still haven't decided) happen, the sweet part
is this could also be installed in the engine access hatch to prevent any
unwanted mechanical adjustments to your engine!!

&gt; Mike,
&gt;
&gt; the only problem with this is that a talented thief may target the least
&gt; likely point of access to cause him/her an alarm problem.  In this case,
they
&gt; would go in through the slider door, (or tailgate?) figuring its the
toughest
&gt; one to tie into an alarm system on an older vehicle.  You may want to have
&gt; them install a dome light switch here also.
