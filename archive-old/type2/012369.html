Subject: piston O rings vs. new pistons and rebuilt heads ?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello all!

This is my first time writing to the list. I have a
question. I own a 1973 vw transporter that has a 1972
engine with stock automatic tranny in it. I would like
to rebuild the engine but should I buy a kit that has
new pistons or the kit that just comes with new piston
O rings? My other question is, should I buy new heads
or refurbished ones?

Thanks!
David from Wilmington, NC
