Will:

There are three basic routes that Railroads go through the rockies.

     The Northern basically follows I 90 through Montana.

     The Union Pacific  roughly follows I 80 through Wyoming.

     The D &amp; RG  follows the Colorado River and I 70 Through Colorado
     (later it follows the Price River up over Soldiers Summit in the Wasatch
     Mountains and into SLC)

     The Old Midland started at Colorado Springs, went up Ute Pass to Leadville,
     then through several tunnels under the rockies to Glenwood Springs, but it
     was taken out of service in the &quot;50's.  Looking at the Colorado map you can
     see that the old right of way has been turned into roads that go into and
     out of Leadville (as well as Cripple Creek), some paved, some not.  I plan
     to explore these later this summer.



Have fun
