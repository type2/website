Bryan...
	something else to check is the fast idle cam... notched and more or
less hooked up to the electric choke butterfly shaft. There is a guide
pin that normally keeps it in check, but for some reason, when it is not
there, a certain amount of springy tension can flip the cam upside down.
This makes the engine rev really high (as the throttle is held wide
open)... flip the cam back around and it should work ok...
	You know about that frayed cable, too... so I'll leave that alone...

&gt; I was on my way to work today when i stepped on the gas and the pedal went
&gt; staight to the floor, i reached down and pulled the pedal back up but it did no
&gt; good.  The engine stayed revved up and wouldnt stop until i shut off the
&gt; engine.  I looked back at the engine and where the cable goes through the
&gt; firewall its all frayed but couldnt find a broken spot.  Didnt have enough time
&gt; to look at it yet since i was going to be late for work.  Any suggestions on
&gt; what to do to fix it.
&gt; Thanx brayn72bus
