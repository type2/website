Subject: RE: CB Radios

&gt;===== Original Message From &quot;Bergey, Dennis&quot; &lt;dbergey_at_sbmuseart_dot_org&gt; =====
&gt;Has anyone on the list researched a good portable CB Radio solution for the
&gt;camper?
&gt;I would like to have something for in route communication, not necessarily
&gt;built into the dash but more on the portable-removable side.
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions?

When my wife and I moved to Las Vegas from Chicago (me in the U-Haul her in 
her Ni***n), we simply bought a CB and converted the power end to a cigarette 
lighter adapter.  Plugged it into the lighter and got magnetic antennas for 
the roof.

It is not powerful, but definitely let us communicate back and forth. Easy to 
remove as well.  The only drawback is that the CB unit needs to be &quot;wedged&quot; 
somewhere (the dash, between seats....) or it tends to slide around.
