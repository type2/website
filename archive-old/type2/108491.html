Subject: [T2] AFM gate


&gt; On a '78 2.0 FI USA Federal model: (standard trans)
&gt;
&gt; (1) Does the AFM gate have to touch the base to get the reading that
&gt; measures the air flow thru the AFM??  When i take the AFM off, and put
into
&gt; the light, I am seeing light coming through the bottom edge of the AFM
gate,
&gt; like if a door was closed and you could see the light from the other room
at
&gt; the bottom of the door.

I don't believe so.  The reading of the position of the gate takes place
above the gate; as the &quot;door&quot; moves a pointer moves with it along a
resistive track.  The gate moves freely in response to demands from the
engine for air, which it couldn't do if it was touching the base of the AFM.

&gt; (2) I am having an endemic problem with stalling.  And I had a massive
&gt; amount of blow by recently, as a result of hitting 70 MPH at some points.
&gt; Oil came from the oil breather into the Air Intake Elbow Boot, and
probably
&gt; back to the AFM gate.  This has happened before.

&gt; Could a bunch of oil settling on the AFM gate base plate cause an air flow
&gt; misreading such that the ECU thought a lot of air was coming through and
&gt; shot the FIs to make too an over rich mixture that causes stalling??
(after
&gt; stall, it acts like a carb engine that was flooded.  Starts in 1 sec when
&gt; stone cold, but take 7 secs of turning engine to get it to catch after
&gt; stall.  then I have to pump that accel to get it to higher revs. Stalls
even
&gt; in gear!!)

Don't think so.  The AFM would send a signal that would result in a too-rich
mixture is the gate was open *wider* than it should be, given the demands of
the engine.  (Gate &quot;more open&quot; = signal to &quot;send more gas.&quot;)  If the gate is
swinging freely back and forth with no &quot;sticky&quot; points along the way then it
should be OK.

&gt; (3) I plan to clean the AFM plate with starting fluid.  Is this OK??  Will
&gt; the ether hurt the plate??  (I was looking for a vacuum leak, and when I
&gt; sprayed the ether over some of the oil that came from my oil breather blow
&gt; by, the oil on the oil breather and engine seemed to dissolve.  It
&gt; disappeared.)

I don't think it'll hurt it, but why not just use some paint thinner, some
rags and some Q-tips to clean things up.

&gt; Engine is suddenly running super cool, and suddenly the gas mileage is
down.
&gt;  Rich mixture.

As the AFM ages the spring inside the AFM that resists the turning of the
air flap weakens, leading to a too-rich condition in all situations.  The
engine can handle this on startup but can't once it's warmed up.  After
you've eliminated all other possibilities you might consider opening up the
AFM and adjusting the spring.
