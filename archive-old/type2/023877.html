X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

There is not difference between the 914 2.0 engine and the Bus 2.0
engine...minor sheetmetal differences when installed in the 914.  But I'm
sure the Bus sheetmetal was used, as the 914 tin and engine bearer would not
fit.

on a certain auction site we can't post about.

you figure it out.

If I were in CA boy, that body is worth what it's at now.  Let alone if
it actually is a 914 2.0 engine.
