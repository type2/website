Subject: Re: [T2] Ammeter Question...


Rogelio,

Good post. I haven't made this installation on a bus but since there is a 
fair amount of distance involved I wouldn't skimp on the copper.

Do you know what the terminal resistance of this VDO amp meter is?
The reason I ask is that there seems to be many complaints about voltage 
drops in the starter solenoid circuit for T2s (hot start problems.

Chuck
