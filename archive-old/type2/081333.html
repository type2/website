&gt;Well, I've had a good look at the 'tight' new CV's. They are definitely not
locked, they do &gt;move, I just need to put a screwdriver handle through the
spline to turn them. There doesn't &gt;seem to be any build up of dry
lubricant/packing grease so I don't think that has any affect. I &gt;took Dave's
advice and turned them 'one ball' each way, this made no difference so I put
&gt;them back to how they came (tough job!). My local supplier assured me this
would not &gt;impact on the life of the CV's I was just surprised at the
inconsistency of the 4 CV's. I was &gt;more concerned about the ones that move
freely, they move easier that the old warn ones I &gt;put back in!

Q : Does &quot;Lobro&quot; indicate brand name, or is it like &quot;xerox&quot; ( or &quot;VW &quot; :)
indicating any cheap copy of a brand name part ?
Turning the race one ball in rotation does make a difference.
There is considerably less articulation in one position, wherein
the races lose half the flex in the in/out direction. ( Axial ?:)
The correct orientation will display a small segment of the inner race
opposite a large segment of the outer race. A correctly assembled
CV joint will display twice as much articulation.
You may have to wait a very long time to use those new CV joints,
if you turned the used ones to apply torque forces in the opposite direction,
as this provides unused surfaces of the races to wear.
They may be more properly stored back on the supplier's shelf.
