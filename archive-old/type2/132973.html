Subject: Re: [T2] Decison  -opinions needed

James,

My personal opinion only......

Buy the best body you can possibly afford to start with.

If it is truely &quot;rust free&quot;, then the rest of it is a piece
of cake....(from someone who does NOT do bodywork).

Repairing bodies is much more expensive to me than all ofthe 
other stuff put together.

Only drawback that I can see is the automatic, but you can rectify that 
later if you want to.

I can buy a 2liter stocker outright for less than a crappy paint job.

Think about it...


Cheers, dave

&gt; It's a 74, all original deluxe westie with one exception. It has a 2liter
&gt; fuel injected motor in it. It's an automatic.  It's immaculate. No rust 
&gt; whatsoever.
&gt; literally.  Comes with a side tent, the mosquito screens for the rear door,
&gt; even the original icecube trays for the dual powered fridge. Canvas and all
&gt; is immaculate.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;sigh&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Do I go ahead and do the motor in mine? Or save the money and sell my bus
&gt; for a little, adding the amounts together.. raising a little more and buy 
&gt; the nice
&gt; sparkly one?
&gt; 
&gt;
