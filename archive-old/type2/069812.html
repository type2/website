Subject: '71 Westy stalls at stop lights

My '71 Westy runs better than ever now except if I don't rev the engine as
I'm coming to a stop, it dies.  It will start right back up again but I can't
figure out what's wrong with it.  Is it my timing?  My idle speed on my
carburator?  Or is this a common bus problem?  I've already checked idle
speed with tachometer and got it down to 800-900 RPM but haven't been able to
check timing because I can't get my new strobe light to work on my bus--see
my other posting.  Any help or words of encouragement are appreciated.
