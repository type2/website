If no one  has given you one of those &quot;I did this and it worked great&quot; ideas
I would stick with a new used bell housing to keep things simple.
I would check the pilot bearing in the flywheel to make sure your input
shaft isn't the reason the seal and sleeve failed in the first place.(due to
chattering)
Good luck
Brian

&gt; Hey all,
&gt;     I promise this will be the last post from me on this topic. I am still
&gt; trying to determine 3 things about this piece that came out when I pulled
my
&gt; rear Trans seal.
&gt; 1. what is it called (Oil Sling return, bearing race. This is more for my
&gt; piece of mind)
&gt; 2. does it need to be pressed in
&gt; 3. would I be best served just replacing the bell housing ($20 bucks from
my
&gt; FLARS)
&gt;
&gt; Rob posted some pics I sent to him on his website. Please take a look and
&gt; let me know.
