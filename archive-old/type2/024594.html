my 71 Westy did the same thing, well at least it was stuck in gear....

it ended up that the bracket which holes the shift rods had broken, this is 
inside the nose cone of the trans, 

ray at Volks Authority in San Jose fixed it for me.....

crawl under the bus and have someone move the shifter.....
then look at the coupler like Jake said.....if this seems Ok it m ight be the 
tranny

I also had a coupler come loose internally, it would move front to back 1st 
and 3rd , or 2nd and 4th but not to the side, the round shaft would move 
inside the coupler, I guess the spot weld broke, had to drive it a day with 
only 2nd +4th as all the shops were closed for a holiday weekend......
I replaced it and it was fine ......the fun and excitment of old buses........
