Subject: Re: [T2] por-20 vs por-15

In a message dated 9/10/06 12:06:39 PM, jeremiah.stutte_at_gmail_dot_com writes:


&gt; both por-20 and por-15 come in high-temp formulas.  if i wanted to paint my
&gt; muffler, a chromed four tipper, and exhaust manifolds and exhaust pipes and
&gt; possibly heater boxes to both dress them up and prevent further rusting,
&gt; road chemical damage, etc. which should i use?  the por-15 comes in color
&gt; factory gray and por-20 comes in color satin aluminum.  pros, cons.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

That's fine for the outside but what about the inside of everything...The
system (pipes, muffler, heater boxes...) heats up from the exhaust but
water condenses inside when it cools...;-(
