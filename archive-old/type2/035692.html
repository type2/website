Subject: Westy mod for neatniks

On my last camping trip, I spent too much time glancing around my camper 
looking for things that I could improve. At the top of the list was my 
over-the-bed storage compartment. Although my camper is not a Westy, I 
did use a lot of ideas from Westies I've studied; my rear compartment is 
based on early bay Westies with the heart-shaped open front.

Stuff tends to get lost and mixed up in there. The design is perfect for 
stowing my polarfleece sweater and longjohns for getting up in the 
morning, but everything behind these two items is a jumble. So I got the 
idea that the bin should be more like airliner overhead bins: hinged at 
the back to drop down for loading and rumaging. All that is needed in the 
way of modification is a rigid frame with the same perimeter dimensions 
as the stock bin, and cutting down the bottom of the stock bin to fit. 
Remove the stock back and sides; replace with vinyl side sewn at the 
corners and attached to the headliner. The easiest way to keep the unit 
in the closed position is with two latches -- one at each side -- and a 
hinged back. Straps regulate how far the thing opens. 

So now there is human-sized room for loading and unloading the bin; it 
takes up no more room than previously; but I can get more in it.
