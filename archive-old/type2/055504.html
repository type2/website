Subject: so-23 questions

Hi all-

I recently acquired an so-23 westy interior (circa 1961) and was hoping
to clean up the old cabinets that look rather weather beaten and have
greasy hand prints all over there. at the same time i don't want to
comprimise the authenticity of the cabinets. if any one out there has
restored these _real wood_ cabinets i would like to hear their input or
how to get rid of the greasy handprints.

i also have these bizxare looking &quot;lights&quot; (i think) that came w/ the westy
(no not the clamshells!) that i cannot identify. if anyone wants to help
solve the mystery i will mail them the pics.

fwiw the numbers on the back of the lights are as follows

TL7  SAEL70
DGM816L1 ~~~K2821/1

Any help on either item would be appreacated. Anybody have any spare
so-23 parts specifically the thing that holds up the backrest of the seat
directly behind the drivers seat?

pics of the so-23 w/ the red and white striped awning can be seen at joe
