Subject: Re: Cylinder head temp?

My '78 Westy automatic (2 liter pancake engine w/ extra external oil 
cooler and EGR valve crudded shut often as not) has a VDO sensor under 
the washer to a head bolt nearest the exhaust port on #3 cylinder. Mine 
sits at 425F under just about any conditions. I've never seen it 
fluctuate by more than 25 degrees under any absurd load or hot weather 
long uphill grade. I haven't noticed any substantial difference in temp 
at times when I've just cleaned out and restored function to my EGR 
system, adjusted fuel mix, timing, or used various octanes of gasoline.

I seem to recall a (much) earlier thread in which some folks concluded 
that temp varied some depending on whether the sensor was under washer on 
a head bolt (like mine) or under the #3 sparkplug (like some have done). 
Could folks who are weighing in on this one also tell where the sensor is 
mounted? Seems like 350-425 is right about where everyone reports their temp.

Mine varies so little that the gauge conveys no useful information. I 
suppose it might be the first to show some catastrophic problem like a 
rag sucked into the fan grill blocking all the air, but in retrospect I 
wish I'd spent the money on a more useful gaurge- like an oil pressure 
gauge- to supplement my oil temp gauge.

As usual, your actual mileage may vary...

Drive safely,
