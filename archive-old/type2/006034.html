Sean-

Here is a link to an essay on complete rebuilding of the EGR system/exhaust 
injection system on the 1974(?)-1983.5 Type 2 motor. Hope it helps.  The 
only changes:
In step #9 the &quot;intake distribution pipes&quot; I speak of are the tiny (3-4 mm) 
pipes inside the intake manifold that inject exhaust into the intake 
stream; NOT the 30mm intake runners.
In step #20, change &quot;?back off the adjustment one-half turn?&quot; to &quot;back the 
adjustment off one-and-one-half turns&quot;. The reason: If the EGR injects 
exhaust too early in the acceleration curve, it will cause a slight, 
predictable hiccup when you try to smoothly leave a stopped position.

Hope all is well with my type 2 &amp; vanagon friends. Although friends suspect 
there is something wrong with our water, I am actually looking for a VW 412 
to add to our stable. If you know of one in GREAT shape, light color, AC &amp; 
Auto, preferably with the aux. heater intact, let me know directly. Rust 
buckets needn't apply.

How do I clean my EGR valve? It is really gummed up.
I have some chem dip that I used for the throttle body but it cant be used
with plastic components. Are there any in the EGR valve?
