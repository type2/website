Subject: Friday: Bus sighting in movie

Happy Friday everyone. 
This week we rented  The Ladykillers, with Tom Hanks. It was extremely funny. Towards the end, one of his co conspirators is met by his girlfriend, who is waiting for him a splittie. The scene is at night, so you only see the sillouhette. OF course you know it's and old bus when she flashes the (dim) headlights. Ther's also a closeup of the women sitting in the drivers's seat. 
Oh and the bus-driving character's name is Mountain Girl. (If you have to ask, go buy or borrow Tom Wolfe's Electric Kool Aid Acid Test) 

Mike
