Subject: Re: Samba Effect /RANT/

Mmm..... if you think price will go down, your up for a surprise!!!
The new Car/ van next design Trent is &quot;Nostalgia&quot;, Going back to those 
nice 50', 60' and 70 shape, no more K-car!!!! (good for us!)

I bought my 73 Westy last August, I spent 45 days and 4000miles looking 
for a strong and road worthy 72-79westy, I saw 17 (in the USA &amp; Canada) 
before I bought mine. I saw so much piece of shi* it was unbelievable; 
most were going for at least 2000US. Al owners were telling me; it's a 
great bus with almost no rust, rebuild engine and so on... HO my god, 
you should have seen those crappie bus's going for 2000 to 6000US, 
rebuild engine my ass. None of those bus in my province (Quebec) were 
worth the price they were asking for, far from it, most of those buses 
wouldn't pas the mechanical inspection and will go directly to the scrap 
yard for being to dangerous to drive. A lot of westy driver are NONE 
mechanically oriented, they don't care about the engine at all and all 
they want is a nice looking van so they can look cool wile driving in 
town! At the end, the only thing I was asking to the owner by phone was, 
how rusty is the chassis!!! No more; how is the engine, how is the 
body!!!! They where all badly restored with spay paint, ton of putty. 
All so called rebuilt engine were leaky, low compression (the owner 
didn't even know!!!) and none of the 16 buses Ive seen had the original 
engine with original parts, at best, they had some of the original 
engine parts. I have to mention that almost all of the buses I've seen 
were sold to others a few day's later.........................

Here in Quebec, a very nice, somewhat well maintained 76-79 westy goes 
for 8-10k (Yes, USD!!!, that's 14-16k CAD = a lot of money$$$) minimum. 
Believe me, An old westy is an investment up here. We have so many for 
an eastern province / state it's unbelievable.
http://www.leswests.qc_dot_ca/tadou2002/p2002.html This is one club!

So finally I saw mine on The Samba!!!! (the guys was asking 8000$CAD 
OBO), it was in Ontario and was for sell for a few months, nobody called 
the owner, I was the fist to go see the bus. EUREKA!!!!!!!!! Finally a 
rust free eastern coast bus (well, not exactly, it was born on the west 
coast). I paid 5800$ CAD (about 3900$USD) for a very clean and original 
Westy, NO rust at all!!! (Well, this bus was in a heated warehouse for 
11 years, not running) Engine was fair enough and was a original rebuild 
VW Canada engine with stock Solex carbs and mechanical fuel pump. With 
all the work I did lately on this bus, I could sell this one for 10k$ 
CAD easily in a few days!!!

I just bought a 98 Honda CivicSI for 10500$CAD, that mean that my old 
Westy is worth about the same price as my 4 years old Honda with 45k 
mile on it.??????????????

Cheers, Ben
