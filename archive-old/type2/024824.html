Ok, I sure this has been covered in the archives,but I can't find it
I believe someone offers the sheetmetal and engine support to put the upright
into the 72 and later van (Like the european transporter)
Does anyone have that information handy?
Also, in the latest VWM mag from the UK they show a *new* Devon camper
Uses a *new* &quot;1973ish&quot; Mexican bus......(Link-pin front end..with disc
brakes!?!?)
Like, you can still *buy* a new bus...
Who had the vin plates for sale??
(only kidding, *I'd* get caught, sure as sunshine)
