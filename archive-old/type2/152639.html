Subject: My First Oil Change

Hello All,
I'm doing my first oil change on my '76 camper that has a 1.7l with Dual
Carbs.
I've got a couple noob questions, I'm using SAE 30 oil, I've always used
that in my Bugs.

Where should I jack the rear end up at? I have a hydraulic floor jack and my
drive way is on a hill so I have to jack the rear end up to even get my arm
under the exhaust.

2nd question is oil filter. My LAPS sold me a Bosch 3402 (I believe) oil
filter. I've read something about you have to use some special german one,
is the Bosch going to work?

I've changed many a Type 1 so I'm not a total retard, but I just get alittle
disoriented with the Bus.

Thanks,
BJ Clark
