Subject: [T2] Jumping out of gear please help me too!

Hi

I have a similar problem on my 81 westy but it happen only between 
the second and third gear instead of the fourth. It does not jump out 
by itself but it does not need much help... just a little push. The 
problem is intermittent. Do I have a trany problem or it is just an 
adjustment?

Thank you very much

François
