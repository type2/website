OK. The double cab is a 1968, white, the condition is between good and very
good. Price is $4,000 (I wanna get $4,000 out of it as I mentioned to you
earlier).
New brakes front and rear, new cv boots, recent tune-up, runs awesome - very
smooth, engine rebuilt apprx. 6 years ago, used transmission installed fall
of 1999, have frame for rear bed cover, interior is in fair- does have crew
cab seat.
Thanks      &quot;Keating, Gina&quot; &lt;GKeatingCS_at_aol_dot_com&gt;
