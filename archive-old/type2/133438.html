&gt; Well it finally caught me.
&gt; After 3,000 miles the used head i put on my engine
&gt; now has a stuck intake valve on #1 piston.
&gt; Question is, what causes a valve to be stuck, like no movement.
&gt; and is there any way to make my engine last another
&gt; 30 miles to get home?

how desperate are you to get 30 miles
is it worth risking your engine
is it worth the cost of a tow.

ok if you still decide to do it...

that particular cyl only.
. remove rocker or push rod in BOTH valves in that cyl
. remove spark plug
. remove fuel injector connector if FI.
. it will be VERY noisy.
. drive at as SLOW RPMs as possible
. make sure valve is stuck in the closed position.
. make sure spring is on the valves
. stress engine as little as possible.

have done it and survived, but you risk the head and cyl and engine but
should have little danger

good luck
Bob
