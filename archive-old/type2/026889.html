Hello list,
   As I was driving home today I heard a horrible grinding noise that lasted 
for a few seconds and then the alternator light came on. Upon inspection it 
turned out the bolt holding the engine fan had come out and it was sticking 
half way out of the engine. So I put it back in and tightened it as much as 
possible. Is there anything else I need to do?
   So while I was down there I thought I would go ahead and unbolt the 
triangle tailpipe thing that bolts to the muffler since my tailpipe rusted 
off the other day and I already had one ordered from the Bus Depot. As I 
undid the first bolt it simply broke off. This was a little disppointing. So 
I soaked the others in WD-40 and then tried them, and they also broke. So 
now I am stuck with 3 studs that aren't long enough to put nuts on with the 
new tailpipe and I have tried everything but they will not move. Only one of 
them is visible from the other side as the others kinda go into the muffler. 
What will be the best way to fix this? They seem to be rusted into one solid 
piece. And I just hope I don't have to buy another muffler as it is not 
rusty.

Thanks,
Nathan
74 Bus
