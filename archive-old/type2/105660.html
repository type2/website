&gt; I've looked at Matts write up and I've been to Stern Lighting page.  The one
&gt; thing I don't understand is I keep the Dimmer relay in circuit (that I
&gt; understand)  But does the power wire from the #56 terminal still send power to
&gt; the lights along with the relay? and will this cause an issue when running
&gt; power to the relays for the lights.

If I understand you correctly, the lead to 56 stays hooked up to the stock
wiring. 56b and 56a connect to terminal 86 on each of your new relays. This
way the dimmer switch (I hate that term) is used to energize the relays
separately and the load on it and the headlight switch is reduced.
