&gt; &gt;  I keep meaning to ask about the name &quot;Grendel&quot;.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  It's from mythology as I recall. Anyone got a &quot;good&quot; encyclopedia?
&gt; 
&gt; Grendel is the mythical beast that is Beowulf's nemesis. Beowulf persues 
&gt; Grendel down into its (do I vaguely remember 'her'?) lair and does it in.

OK, the &quot;Ultra-Cliff Notes&quot;:

Beowulf arrives at Heorot, the hall of one Hrothgar, king of the Geats. 
He finds that this brand spanking spiffy hall is uninhabitable because a
monster (hight &quot;Grendel&quot;) comes by nightly for a midnight (human) snack. 
Beowulf volunteers to sleep over and, when the monster comes by, disarms
him (literally).  The next day Beowulf follows the blood trail back to to
Grendel's place, dives down the hole, past the white rabbit in the vest
with the pocket watch (wait a sec, Steve, What rabbit? {Oops... wrong
story} {ignore the rabbit}) and kills Grendel.  Think the story's over? 
Think again.  See, Grendel has this mum, and she takes offence!  So
Beowulf has to go back and kill mum too.  During the fight with the
mother, he takes a mortal wound and dies (this is after all a Norse tale,
and no one get out of a Norse tale alive!)


&gt; 
&gt; More recently, there is a book called 'Grendel' (don't remember the 
&gt; author) written from the beast's perspective.

John Gardner.  Fine book, There is also a version called &quot;Eaters
of the Dead&quot; narrated (allegedly) by an Arab trader who meets
up wiht Beowulf in Russia and travels home with him.
