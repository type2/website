Subject: Re: rubber for the road

Thanks for clearing that up. BUT I have another question: It was years
ago that I guess I was misinformed about the alphabetical character in
the tire sizes being the width of the tread. But I seem to remember
there used to be tires that were L and other letters? So it made sense
to me at the time. Has it always been R or B only? Am I just having zee
dreaded acid flashback? ;-)
