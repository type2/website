&gt; Yeah, just heard that. A NASCAR Camry... Riiiight (though true). Haven't
&gt; been able to take NASCAR seriously for years... Take a FWD V-6 &quot;car&quot; -
&gt; really just the shape - and put in on a 1963 Ford Fairlane chassis
&gt; design and retain the FWD sedan name... Riiiight.
&gt; 
&gt; WRC - now we can talk... &lt;griN!&gt;

   You want &quot;real&quot; racing, try the Gumball Rally where rich
boys and girls race their toys on open unprotected roads...
If it wasn't for the TV coverage (of the &quot;race&quot; and the 
nightly partying) these guys and gals would be in night
court... It's the same crap you wanted to &quot;try&quot; when you
first got your license but couldn't afford the lawyers to
keep you out of jail... ;-(
