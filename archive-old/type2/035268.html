Subject: re: cost effectiveness 

If you visit Cartalk_dot_com you can find an interesting study that they or
someone else performed on the cost effectiveness of \
New vs Newer Used vs Older Used vehicles.
I haven't read it for quite a while but the facts are right there dollars
and sense.  (pun intended)
If you do most of your own work, you make out better.

BTW
anyone heard from the bus tour lately?
