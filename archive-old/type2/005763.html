&gt; i had a good one from the boneyard, and when i applied a liitle pressure
it
&gt; cracked and crazed like a 30 year old piece of ... plastic. are these
being
&gt; reproduced - don't see it in the catalogues? if anyone has a good spare,
&gt; i'd like to trade or buy it. i can swap a to-67 round one, or a 68 one
year
&gt; only reservoir.  THANKS, steve

A 67 mounts to the top of the M/C....not sure how you mount it to a plastic
tube.
A 68 mounts to a metal pipe with a threaded fitting...  not sure how you
would mount it to a plastic tube....
I would use one from an early to mid 70's. It is square and is mounted to
the drivers seat back panel. They are made of tougher longer lasting
plastic. It wouldn't be too hard to mount on the front wall.
