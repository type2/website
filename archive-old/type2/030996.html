I have been reading the discussions about this, and have been thinking
(darn that hurts) but I tend to agree that money is not the thing to get
the list involved with, (Steve was an exception)

&gt; &gt;Note: If you consult Steve Dolan at the end of his trip you may find that
&gt; &gt;finding Internet access became just as important as finding honest
&gt; &gt;mechanics/friendly listees. You can get it at Kinko's but is ain't cheap.

and those of us who do not have laptops........

my 78 is a daily driver, in fact it is my only car.  So I take it most
every place I go, occasionally when it may be limping I might rent a car.

I also carry dang near a complete tool kit and pretty fair complement of
parts (never the one I need though).  More than once I have stopped on the
side of the road and got a VW running (just a couple weeks ago a woman
driving from Calif to New York dropped a set of points on the side of
I-95, had a set she could use (used) and she was back on the road) and
when I have been sitting it is the rare air cooled that has passed me by.
When my GEX blew up, a bus going the other way U turned and took me to a
safe refuge to get a tow. 

HOWEVER  since I am a skier I also take my van into some pretty lonely
places and knowing there was a source of info nearby as to where to find
the left handed wiget that I needed to get back on the road would sure
make some of the trips less &quot;stressfull&quot;  

Since I live near a major tourist destination (Wash DC) I would be
somewhat leery of being overused, but I also have no problem with helping
someone get back on the road. 

in any case,,,, to make a very long story short.

I think the BPRS would best serve me and I could best serve it. as 

.  source of information to get rolling
.  maybe a loan of parts or tools
.  maybe a ride off the roadside to a parts source and back.
.  possible link to the mailist or the library for info

so what I am proposing is that someone going on a trip could be able to
&quot;access&quot; a secure list of volunteers that can be contacted on a specific
route.  

ie:  I'm going up I-83 to I-81 then to Scranton, PA and over to Albany NY.
     I will be leaving on the 14th and returning on the 18th.  who can I
call for help if needed.  (totally ficticious trip, although one I take in
the winter to ski in the area)

thats all,  so prior to departing I down load a list of names and
contacts,  if a problem happens en route I can call one or two of these
folks and get directions to the nearest source of whatever I need, or the
name of the local library that has internet access.
