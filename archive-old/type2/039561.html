&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Is the front bar of these kits better than the stock
&gt; VW sway bar? 

Absolutely. There is no comparison, whatsoever! My bus
corners better and is less susceptible to wind than
when it was stock. The ride is a bit stiffer, but it's
well worth it.

By the way, I paid over $300.00 for mine and I was
happy with them at that price!

The Sway-Away kit also comes with a rear sway
bar...your bus doesn't have one at all now (not from
the factory). So you can imagine what adding a 7/8&quot;
diameter sway bar will do there!


I have yet to hear of one single complaint about
these... and on this list, that says a *lot*!!
