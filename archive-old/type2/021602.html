&gt; Turns out it not only has a Dorm top, but also has the semi
&gt; rare so-69 westy interior which comes with the bench seat plus its got a g as
&gt; heater. Now my girlfriend wonders why I'm so weird that I had to call her
&gt; and tell her about it. &lt;sigh&gt;

I don't think you're weird, Chuck. At least, not where buses are
concerned. ;-)

OK, so maybe you can answer a question I'm having about the interior
that's supposed to go in this 69 Euro-westy you sold me. I bought a
bunch of interior stuff from Scott, right? And it's great, there's a ton
of it, more than I expected. However, I suspect that there are some
&quot;regular&quot; Westy interior components (SO-44?) that weren't originally in
that bus, because it's got a full bench seat in the back, and this seat
matches the front bench seat, so I'm assuming it's original. Which would
preclude a rear &quot;suicide&quot; closet, and possibly the &quot;headache shelf.&quot;
Could it have had a closet behind the driver AND a suicide closet? There
don't seem to be attachment points for the Z-bed, either.

Can anyone (Euro people) tell me what all was included in the original
SO-69 interior? Did it have a full-width bed that went over the bench
seat (which folds down)? All I've found pics of are the camping gear
(closet, sink, stove, fridge) that goes along behind the bulkhead.
