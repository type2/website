&gt;Okay, the only way this is VW-related is that stuff I got goes on or in the

&gt;Scored a mountain bike, a women's 10-speed, a bike rack (the kind that goes
&gt;on the rear cargo hatch and lets you get in the engine compartment), two
&gt;camp stoves, and a 5 lb. LP tank (with LP in it) for $40 today. Not bad, eh?
&gt;
&gt;Both stoves work fine, but one is a coleman that originally used coleman
&gt;fuel and has since been converted to use LP. My question is about the
&gt;conversion tube/attachment thing (can be seen on page 169 of the Campmor
&gt;Fall '96 catalog). I don't know how much I trust it. This metal tube plugs
&gt;into an opening behind the right-side burner, but the tube is then running
&gt;through the flame when you're cooking. Has anyone had any experience with
&gt;this conversion? Is this how it's supposed to go? I'm worried about heating
&gt;the LP in this tube...and what the possible impact of that might be.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks! Joe

hey joe,

I recently purchased a lp conversion for my old coleman 2 burner for our
tripto 4 corners area which included a stop at RMMW for their show and pikes
peak thing. Wife won a 139.00 bus cover door prize! were any list folks
there?  I'm sure list people were at denver the next day, though I didn't
meet any, going away the most Vdubs I've ever seen in one place except
perhaps the junkyard in Munich in the 60's where they had green and white
bug police cars stacked in piles 30' high!

I'm not sure if your lp conversion is the same as mine but mine worked okay
most of the time except when the valve started to ice up then it spit and
sputtered so I had to cover the valve with a rag. (same phenom as carb
icing?) Not sure but I think the idea of running the tube near or through
the flame is to allow for proper vaporization of the fuel.
