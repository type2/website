Danno,
The PIS kit I have uses a  Holley model 5200 built in the U.S. under
licence from Weber Carburetor, S.P.A. Bologna Italy. U.S manufacture
started in 1970 for use in the 1971 Pinto. Using a 1986 &quot;Weber Fuel
Systems&quot; catalog from BAP\GEON I cross matched the 5200 to a Weber 32-36
DFEV . The &quot;E&quot; stands for electric choke. The DG &amp; DF carb series are
mirror images of each other. Primary &amp; secondary barrel positions are
reversed in the body. The throttle lever in the DFV rotates clockwise,
while in the DGV it rotates counter clockwise.  According to the catalog,
the only VW using the DGAV is the 74-75 Dasher with a hot water choke
(replaces a Solex ).
                                                                           
             Ron
