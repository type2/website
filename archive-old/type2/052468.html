[...] The original finish is painted wood grain (on my 71 pop top at 
least).  So, you will need to strip off all of the old finish or else it 
will look wierd.  In my case, the wood on certain panels (sliding door 
and rear hatch) was delaminated, so I replaced the panels and finished 
them with Carver Tripp water based polyurethane.

&gt;   The site will give you some info... the strippers I have
&gt; used require gloves and saftey glasses but do not seem to
&gt; dry out the wood like some do. This product line has been
&gt; around for many moons.

&gt; Hi....I am helping my friend fix his 71 non-pop top Westy
&gt; The wood paneling is peeling off the top layer of what 
&gt; looks like varnish
&gt; I think its because the previous owner used a propane camp 
&gt; stove to  much and 
&gt; it became moist....
&gt; the wood is fine, only the finish is flaking....
&gt; is there anyway to make it look right again ?
&gt;
