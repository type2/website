Subject: Re: [T2] On the subject of heat ...

That's a tough one. Unless the value is published somewhere, or
someone in the industry has a working familiarity with it, you would
have to have a physics book to calculate the fan properties and rpm.
There are some formulas here, but they assume same size fan:

It could be useful to you if your bilges are the same size and you can
measure rpm.

 BUT my real interest is just how much air does the stock blower fan in
 a bay move ? Did this improve in later years vs early years ?
 My 73 squirrel cage does move a fair swack of air, but it seems nowhere
 near what my bilge blowers move, each on their own.
