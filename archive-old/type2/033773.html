Beth,

A few questions -

What kind of tires do you run?  If they are passenger tires, that may be the
problem.  Look at the Tire FAQ on the type2_dot_com website for more info about
tires.

How old are the shocks (front and rear)?  Old shocks will allow your bus to
track from side to side whilst being tossed around in the wind.

Do you have a front stabilizer bar?  It's this big bar that run underneath
the front beam and down the trailing arms with two clamps on each end (on
the arms, not the beam).  If you are missing that or it is an old stock
unit, you will get tossed around as well.

Check out the front and rear of the bus and let us know what you find!

&gt; Is there any way to make driving in the wind less terrifying?  We had
&gt; forty mile per hour winds here near Atlantic City the other night and I
&gt; thought my beloved bus and I were about to get blown off into the
&gt; ocean!
