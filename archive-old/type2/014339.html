Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for-----

 I discovered a dropped 
&gt; valve
&gt; seat,
I was told that MoFoCo manufactures their own heads (except type 4) and
I've heard a lot of negative feedback about them a lot of it from list
members but everything they make can't be crap or they wouldn't still be
in business.
They have to have at least one good thing about them.
My purchase of  jugs and pistons were OK and the gasket set was very
complete and the price was right.
