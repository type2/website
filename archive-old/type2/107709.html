Subject: Slider problems

Hello list I hope all the US members are having a pleasant Labor Day
Celebration. I myself have been working on my sliding door. The other day it
dropped a inch or so at the rear sliding hinge. After removing the  running
cover I discovered that the operating cam has broke. (#15 on page 25 of the
68-76 Bentley manual.) It broke into three pieces. Does anyone know of a
source or have one they want get rid of. Cant seem to find it anywhere. I
have been searching the parts sites using the words &quot;Operating Cam&quot; since
that's what the Bentley calls it. Thanks for you help.
