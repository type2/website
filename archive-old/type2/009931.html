I had the good fortune to visit with Steve on the phone this evening.

He has made it to Seattle OK.  He  traveled up I-5 to Grants Pass, OR,
crossed the Coast Range to the Oregon Coast, up US101 to Astoria, OR,
across the Columbia River into Washington, then on to Seattle via
Raymond, Montesano, and Olympia.

He hopes to get into a local chassis dynamometer shop tomorrow
(Wednesday) for some more fine tuning and tweaking on his engine.

If all goes well he'll be heading back East sometime this weekend.
