&gt;I am planning to point it towards Memphis to meet up with some friends
&gt;and await the arrival of a FedEx package 


I realized as soon as I sent this that folks would wonder &quot;whatcha gettin
sent?&quot;

nothing illegal :)
just microphone capsules/recording equipment. I use them to record live music.
I suppose the only reason I even typed that was because tuesday we will be
waiting on FedEx, soon as the delivery man comes we are on the road!

in case you were wondering...
