&gt; service that i can send my driver,passenger and

&gt; the locks any information would be grateful

You can take the door handles off, remove the lock cylinders by taking out
a phillips screw behind the cylinders, and then rearrange the wafers
within the cylinders to match your keys.

Be sure to have a key in the cylinder before removing the cylinder from
the handle to prevent loss of little bits!

It's not difficult, just time consuming.
