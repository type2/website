Subject: Wires go to where?

OKay folks almost there making the last connections on the cleaned up GEX PO 
pocket saver and I have run into some wires that I don't know WTF they are 
for. I have been pouring through Bently, Type II fuel systems and pics on 
the web to try and find out what is going on.

OK:
There are two wires coming from my FI wiring harness. They are white and 
have covered female spade connectors on each. I can make out the red 
numbering on the wires, barely. One says 12 the other says 40 I think. They 
exit the harness at the front (FIF) right corner of the engine compartment. 
I can't seem to find anything to plug them into...well my mouth but they 
don't taste good and I want to get everything connected.

I am on hold now waiting for a Thunder storm to pass so I can make my final 
connections under the bus and solve my wiring issues. Any help would greatly 
be appreciated.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
