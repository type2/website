&gt; &gt; Q2.  How does the fuel gauge work?  My gauge reads ok when the tanks full
&gt; &gt; (it shows it as being over 3/4) but when the tank gets down to around half
&gt; &gt; or less, the gauge jumps around, pegging both ends, frantically.  It doesn't
&gt; &gt; seem to do it as bad when the car is on but not running.  Thoughts?

The problem is intermittent connections in the sender.
Inside the sender are 2 stretched conductive wires and a contact on a
float the wires can get contaminated spots that dont conduct well and you
get a jerky fuel gauge.
The best fix is to replace the sender.
You can fool with the senders innards but its a real hassle to put it back
only to find that it still doesnt work so well.
