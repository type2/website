&gt; Hello fellow bus fans! Thanks again for all the help you guys offered when
I
&gt; was having tranny problems! Unfortunately though, I am faced again with
more
&gt; problems! About 2 months after re-doing the transmission on my 71 bus, I
&gt; noticed a slight chugging noise while driving, my engine (1600 single
carb)
&gt; has also taken to burning oil, now needing a quart or 2 every couple
weeks.
&gt; I tried doing some (crude) timing adjustments, replacing the spark plugs,
&gt; and other things but it keeps worsening. The chugging noise  is much
louder
&gt; and is causing the engine to sound quite similar to a lawnmower! I tried
&gt; idling the engine, and pulling plugs one at a time on the distributor and
&gt; the chugging *did* cease when I pulled the wire for the back left
cylinder,
&gt; but it is getting plenty of power so I know it's not electrical. I've been
&gt; trying to solve this problem for about a month now but without knowing
&gt; anybody of significantly greater engine knowledge I have had little
insight
&gt; on how to fix this. Some of my vw friends (unfortunately with as much or
&gt; even less engine knowledge as me) think the engine is shot, and if so I am
&gt; prepared to buy another one, but I would much rather, if possible, save
the
&gt; life of the one I have now. Any ideas?

Do a compression test first.  It will help you diagnose/answer the question.
Each cylinder should have at least 100 lbs. or better.
