Subject: Re: sliding door latch

P.P.S. The early two-ended Westy inside handle could also be pushed
forward from the top handle to seat the latch, but be careful not to
break it -- I don't know how brittle they may have become after all
these years, and those handles seem to as scarce as hen's teeth.

And note: When you lock the door from the inside, it can't be unlocked
from the outside, and vice versa.
