&gt; http://www.ismi_dot_net/riecherttuning/index.htm I'm wondering what

&gt; would do to harm reliablity and what kind of power increase it

Hey there Jamie,

One of the admins (Steve D.) had a 2.2L in his Vanagon. I say had
'cause he had all kinds of trouble getting the thing to run right
with the stock FI system. The 2.2L (bored and stroked?? 2.0L) was
running to lean (to hot) I think. (Steve - correct me or add anything
please). 

I guess that if you ran dual webers or the CB perf. FI ($1700+) you
could jet 'em to supply enough gas to a *big* motor, but I haven't
heard of anyone doing it with the stock VW bus FI. You'd get tons of
HP, but lose the reliability of the stock FI system.

*IF* you could get bigger injectors (they're rated in lbs) the it
*might* be possible to use the stock FI. I came across the following
link that might prove useful.

I've often thought about getting a stroker crank (w/ stock 94mm
P&amp;C's) when my 79 needs rebuild, but I'm reluctant to give up the
inherent reliability of my stock FI system.

Sandrunners use the type4 engine in all kinds of big cube forms.
These are the guys that would know if a stock bus system could be
modified to be used on a motor like this. I surpose that they would
just use Webbers or aftermarket FI units, but perhaps someone has
done this on the &quot;cheap&quot; using the stock bus system as a base.

Check out the type4 forum (and forsale classifieds too!) at:

http://shoptalk.tunacan_dot_net/bbs/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&amp;BypassCookie=true

Ultimately the problems lies with supplying a big cubed motor with
the flow of gas that it requires reliably.

Hope this helps,
