&gt; No attempt made on my part to challenge your statement as to the requirement

&gt; PREFER to locate the filter ahead of the fuel pump, and if I could figure
&gt; out how to make it work on my bus, I would do it.  So if anyone has any
&gt; suggestions, I'm open.

have you tried a larger filter with faster flow rate??
or maybe your pump is getting tired??
I know when I had carb engines my fuel filter was before the pump and
don't think I had any problems
