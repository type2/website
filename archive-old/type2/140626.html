Subject: RE: [T2] Type 2 in France and Switzerland

There were many reasons why various motor alternatives were offered in 
different countries. Tax was one, but initial cost was another big reason.
Here in Australia both motors were offered in the '73 and later bay's, the 
1600 version had a big saving in initial purchase price.
As the years went on the type 4 motor became by far the most common though. 
Some government departments such as our armed forces still ordered their Bay 
panel vans with 1600's. Interestingly FI motors are also uncommon in 
Australia, not quite sure why, could again have to do with price or the 
diminishing dealers to support a &quot;more complicated motor&quot; at the time.
Other odd things also happened like front door quater windows and petrol 
heaters are very rare here, but the front dash fans (or Ambulance fans) are 
very common!

Just on the Diesel debate, we too have a very limited range of diesel 
European cars, but it's due mainly to the poor quality of the diesel at out 
pumps than what dealers are able to import. They have a much higher grade of 
diesel in Europe.
