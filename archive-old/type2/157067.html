and the temp got down to -38 celcius. The wind stripped
the heat out of the bus faster than it could make it.  That
was the coldest time I have ever had. I was in a fully insulated
set of coveralls plus covered up in an old army sleeping bag.
Luckily the kids didn't have to come back with me. I also
had one of those black cats running at my feet as well
