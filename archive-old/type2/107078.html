&gt; I just replaced my drag link, got it from The Bus Depot.
&gt; 
&gt; I used a pneumatic gun with a chisel tip.  I backed off the old crown
&gt; nut and hit on it.  This took about 45 to 60 seconds per end to get it off.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It was very simple and quick.

Mine came off this way the first time also but before I could stop the
person from doing that, it popped out. 60s of hammering can't be good for
the steering box. Opinions?
