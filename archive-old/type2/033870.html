Dawn did not disappear and to my knowledge has never screwed anyone
over...im not even sure how she got involved in this conversation. A problem
I had with my canvas was &quot; no prob&quot; and she said to send it back and she'd
pay shipping and that she was sorry. Although now she moved from Oregon or
wherever to right down the street from me in AZ, so all I gotta do is go
drop it off :)  Can you believe someone would relocate their business
location JUST SO I wouldn't have to pay for shipping?!?! now THATS good
business!  hahah
(now if I can just get her to reimburse me for gas money... =)
Her webpage has all the info about her new location if anyones tryin to
contact her.
