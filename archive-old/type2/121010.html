That was great! I had a good giggle. Nice effect having the shot of the
Westy in the background. Looks like a nice neighborhood. You have a Good New
Year.

All the best from Vancouver Island in the forgotten province of B.C.

Happy New Year volks.

 

Some sightings of the new microbus near Motorola HQ have been reported

on this list -- Yesterday morning I saw one on the road here in

Canada. Luckily I had my new digital camera with me and was able to

sneak a pic while the driver was away from the vehicle. I'm not

thrilled with their color choice, but it looks very true to the

prototype:

For those who are skeptical, I can assure you no photoshop trickery

whatsoever was used in this image.

 

Happy trails,
