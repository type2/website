Subject: RE: [T2] Cut &amp; Buff

If you use 2 Pak (Acrylic Enamel) paint there is no need to cut and buff the
paint at all. The only part that will need to be cut are the little bits of
dust that always find their way into the surface. It is standard practice to
cut these pieces of dust out and polish it back up. With Acrylic Lacquer it
is necessary to buff the entire paint job (just to get a decent shine). It
is normal policy for painters to not buff trucks as much as cars, but this
has more to do with the fact that trucks are more commonly used for work
purposes and don't need to have a nice shine. 

I used to be a spraypainter and can say that if I was painting the bus with
acrylic lacquer (not very common any more) I would cut and buff the entire
thing, roof and all. However, I did know many painters who wouldn't bother
with the roof but would do all of the other panels. If I was using Acrylic
Enamel, there is only a need to cut out the dust pieces. Acrylic Enamel has
natural shine which means it isn't necessary to cut and buff the whole thing
(This is why it is now the standard in Auto Paint).

Subject: [T2] Cut &amp; Buff


Hiya All,

I'm going to get the Duck painted here pretty soon and I was wondering about

something the painter mentioned to me.  He said that it was common to NOT 
polish (cut and buff) a truck (or van) as much as one would do when
finishing 
off a car.  All of you with painting experience, what do you think about
that?

I really don't know that much about the technical end of auto painting.  I
do 
know that &quot;cut and buff&quot; refers to dressing down the surface after the 
paintjob to bring out the lustre in the paint.  Is the painter's statement 
true?  Is cutting and buffing usually not done to the same degree on a truck

or van?
