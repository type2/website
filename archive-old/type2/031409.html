&gt; &gt; for example, in Model Railroading, all those toy trains have logo's from
&gt; &gt; various companies plastered on the sides,   The Model Hobby Dealers Assoc
&gt; &gt; have worked out a token $1 fee for a 25 year license on the use of the
&gt; &gt; logo's from the various Railroads.  This protects the logo but allows
&gt; &gt; hobbiest to also get the accuracy they desire
&gt; 
&gt; And then again...no one's going to suspect that a 1:87 locomotive that says
&gt; Great Northern on the side was made by or endorsed by the Great Northern

BUT it is protecting one's trademark and logo...and yes there are one or
two that refuse to participate and you can't buy models of those railroads
etc.  one even went the VWofA route and prosecuted one or two of the model
makers....(it was later resolved)
