Subject: Re: Interesting paintjobs

&gt;I want to spice up the exterior of my Camper....Has anybody got any
&gt;piccies of Interesting paintjobs, i.e flowers, patterns, cartoon
&gt;characters etc....Or know of any websites with good ones on...
&gt;
&gt;TIA

I am seriously thinking of doing one of these:

-get a couple dozen cans of spray paint, take it to the art dept. at the
university, let the students do something artistic with it.  Memos:  got to
remember to mask it first.  Tell them not to do the underside.

-couple dozen cans of granite-type paint.  It would eliminate a lot of work
since that paint looks like it has rust spots anyway...

-simple white/gray smeary paintjob, then let the wife do her &quot;faux marble&quot;
thing.  A lousy job on my part wouldn't be noticed much.

Anyone ever painted one to look like a loaf of whole-wheat?  How about
shingles on top, with the rest red brick?

Any of these would require some sort of protective top coat.  Suggestions on
that?
