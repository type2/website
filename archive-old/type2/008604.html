John and All,

There is an excellent site devoted to this procedure....poptops_dot_com.
They also sell canvas, etc...  I bought mine from them, but haven't
installed it yet so can't tell you any more. Apparently Dawns is
closer in color to the original (mines kind of light brown instead of
goldenrod).
