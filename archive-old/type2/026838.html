This is the piece that is at (some people say) the FRONT of the engine, 
CLOSEST to the firewall and fuel tank. It (of course) is for a TYPE II 
(Westfalia) and must have the slot for the doghouse cooler intake (sucking 
point fpr air that goes past the oil cooler element).

By looking at the last one I've seen, it must also have the &quot;added on&quot; sheet 
metal that gives it more the &quot;square with rounded corners&quot; than the 
parabolic (bug) profile.

Please contact me directly should you be confused, or think you have the 
ticket.

Mykl and
Rusty (71 Westfalia)
