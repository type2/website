X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

     I just wanted to update the list on a happy parts dealer story. I have 
been posting to the list about a situation I have had with BFY and a Mexican 
Longblock. The first motor they gave me looked the same as Mexican 
longblocks that I have bought before. I got it home and noticed that the 
heads had been taken off. This bugged me so I call them. They said they take 
off the heads of all of those motors to seal the base of the cylinder. I 
accepted this explanation. Later on I discovered that the engine had been 
dropped on the head and bent the rocker arms. I asked for a exchange engine 
which they gave me today. I am very happy with the way they treated me. I 
would do business with them in the future. They gave me an engine right out 
of the box.
     I got the engine home and noticed that the push rod tubes on one side 
have a dents in them. I will take out the push rods and check for 
straightness. I am not mad at BFY. There is no way they could have seen this 
problem before they gave me the engine. Also this not a mexican motor. THis 
motor is from Brazil. It is different than the MExican longblock in a few 
major ways.
1. It came with a new front pulley and tin. The tin is different than mine, 
so I will have to change it out.
2. It came with the dist. drive INSTALLED. THis was a nice surprise.
3. It came with type3 air deflectors installed, nice.
4. THe case has the bosses put in not taped out to hang in a bus.
5. THe case in single relief valve. NOt a nice surprise. The oil passages 
appeared to be smaller. I will be installing dog house cooler,will this be a 
problem? IS there any thing I should be aware about a single relief case? I 
have only had Dual cases.
6. Also came with a warranty in Portuguese. Good luck getting the local VW 
dealer to honor it.

If anybody has any advice on a single relief cases please let me know.
