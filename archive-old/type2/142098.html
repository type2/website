Subject: Re: [T2] Things that stink

Hey Chad... Bought a replacement ignition switch for a friend's '78
Riviera bus but it would not start unless I kept the switch out of the
bus and turned it with a screwdriver. 

Turns out that the slight bit of wear on the end of the ignition key
lock caused just enough slop when mated to the ignition switch
(assembled) that it would not twist the ignition switch enough to reach
the &quot;start&quot; position. 

Your test is pulling the wire off of the starter that runs from the key
and see if it is getting 12 volts - test bulb ala Muir or a test meter
(multimeter) is required. Because the starter is getting no power (you
have the wire off - right) it SHOULD be safe but why take the chance? Be
sure you are laying so the bus can't run over you (perpendicular to the
length of the bus). I lay lengthwise and have a helper ensure the bus is
in neutral, clutch is in, and their foot on the brake. Too busy to get
killed working on a car/van/truck... &lt;grin!&gt;

In the end we bought 2 new locks with keys and two new switches and
replaced both on both of our busses just to be sure... Our list
suppliers sell the keys and lock for about $10 and the switch for
another $10 or so. Well worth the money!

My 200K mile bus was fine (so far) and her bus only had a confirmed 75K
miles on it when the switches wore out so go figure...
