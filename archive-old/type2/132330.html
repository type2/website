&gt; went to my shed and pulled out my box of left over distributors from motor
&gt; cores I've been given over the years, and found mostly variants of the 205
&gt; distributor: 205 P, 205 C, 205 S, 205 AA. Hmmm... I thought I had a 244 in
&gt; there somewhere, but I don't see it. Also a multitude of 009's.

Bentley has a chart which explains how each of those advance (at the bus
ones).

&gt; The main trouble I am having is getting one that has the vacuum advance in
&gt; the correct location. Half have it on one side of the distributor, and half
&gt; on the other, but neither gives me a position where the vacuum advance
&gt; doesn't hit the engine tin before correct timing is achieved.

Some are for Type 1 and some for Type 4. To put a beetle dizzy on a Type 4
or vice version you will have to ingore where the TDC #1 notch on the body
is in order to put it on but the rotor will still have to be indexed to the
crank.
 
&gt; So right now I've got an 009 in it, but I know it doesn't give sufficient
&gt; advance, and I've got it about 12 BTDC at idle in order to get 36 BTDC at
&gt; 2500 RPM.

Are you purposely trying to raise John C.'s blood pressure? :-)
