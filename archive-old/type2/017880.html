The van that I drive pretty exclusively (MY van!) has new shocks that we
put on last year, and it does not bottom out, and never did--even loaded
for bear.  Just cant see very far out the rear view mirror.

I will have the mechs check this out and see what they say.  Though,
down here, every other 71 I've seen seems to ride like this.

I was wondering if some other mirror might hang a little lower--that
would be alot cheaper!   ;-)
Thanks,

Lauria

Lealon,
 
I believe your problem is that the rear end of your Westy is sagging.  I
had the same problem until I reset the rear torsion bars to raise it
back up. The angle shifted back and I have no problem looking out the
rear window.  With the rear up, the front end in front of the axle
angles lower.   Also, when fully loaded with passengers and gear, the
front end is now the one that tends to bottom out first.
