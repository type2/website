Subject: Batteries

While under the car today and glancing through the hole in my passenger side
battery tray I noticed a lot of white flakes from the battery. I washed
everything out but still can't figure out why this happens once in a while.

This got me thinking about batteries and I had a few questions:

- ETKA shows a cover for the battery (two sizes). Does anyone have one?

- how does the aux. battery tie down. Only the passenger side has the hole
and bolt for the hold down plate?
