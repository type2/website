Subject: Saphire II radio w/Playtape

Thanks to listee Abraham Palmer's recent move, I have acquired a Saphire
II radio with Playtape. It currently resides in a box in the back of my
Swedish stationwagon. A box, not &quot;the&quot; box. I don't know if it works, and
I have no use for it (being an agnostic on the matter of stock/period
accessories), but I know that someone, somewhere, might want it. So if
that person is you, p-mail me and it's yours absolutely free of cost or
shipping charges.
