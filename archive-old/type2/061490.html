Subject: Re: Engine stalls

&gt;I have a 1600dp with a 009 dist in my 72 &gt;bus.Every time that I am going over 25mph and put &gt;on the brakes the engine stalls.
 
First thing I'd do is check the integrity of the vacuum line running between the Carburator and the Brake servo (which sits up by the front axle)- any weakness in that line will cause a vacuum leak, which among many other bad things, will cause the bus to stall out and idle erratically. If your idle is smooth and the hose checks out,(it might still be seals in the servo, though I don't know about this) I'd look to the advance on the 009 - can you correct the stall by riding the clutch a little? If so it's a dead spot due to the use of the 009 with a 34.3 or bigger carb.
