Subject: One more plea!!

Does anyone have the right lower engine tin from a '77 bus (I think it
is the same from '76-'78).  This is the piece that bridges the engine
block to the heat exchanger and covers the thermostat.  It is very hard
to come by.  If you have one of these laying around please contact me!!
thanks
