&gt;inadvertently left my rear engine door open.  Oil temp gauge read 20
&gt;degrees cooler for about 20 minutes

Wow, is this really a standard thing to do?  If it helps the engine run
so much cooler (and we all want our engines to run cooler) maybe someone
should/does make a rear engine door with louvers in it like the engine
door on the convertable beetles.  Anyone ever tried this or heard of it?
