Subject: Oil filter rupture

A few weeks ago I'm driving my 78 to work when the oil light goes on.  I
pull over, and sure enough there's no oil in the engine but a quickly
pooling puddle on the ground next to it.  The oil filter looks slightly
canted to one side.

Insert cussing.

Anyway, I have the bus towed home (first time I've ever had to do that)
and it sits there while I wait for my schedule and the weather to
simultaneously clear.  Speculation runs to a cracked oil filter flange
to a bad relief valve plug.  Neither of these sound fun.

Today I pull off the oil filter and it's got a nice blowout along the
top seal.  Immediate problem identified.  I replace the oil filter,
replace the oil and start it up.  No oil light.

But I have a few questions-

1) The oil filter that was on the bus was not the stock filter, but a
W940/25, which is for later model VWs.  I hadn't done the oil myself
before, so I suspect the place I brought it to (some independent shop
down the block) used that rather than the proper filter.  Could using
the wrong filter have led to it blowing out?

2) is there some other issue that comes to mind that I should look for
that could cause the oil pressure to go so high as to burst a seal on an
oil filter?

Thanks,

-mike
