Sorry, all... I have been composing this post for a week or so, and after
adding a couple lines, intended to postpone it for a bit.  Alas,
fumblefingers that I am, I wound up sending it instead...  soooo... I am
now finishing it so it at least makes some sense :-)

I recently &quot;fixed&quot; my car :-( and I am at a bit of a loss as to where to
go next (and *no*, it's not rip out the FI :)  Because the throttle body
was very dirty and the throttle was sticky, I removed and cleaned it.  
Now the bus idles very high, even with the throttle speed adjustment screw
turned all the way in.  Runs fine on the highway and is not overheating,
but the idle is a bother and I'd like to cure it.  The only other time I
have had similar symptoms, the small vacuum line to the decel valve had
fallen off.  Because it had been a past problem, and I had a spare
(indeed, I had just floped this decel valve in to test it before I &quot;fixed&quot;
the car), I flopped the 'new' decel valve back out, without any change in
symptoms.  The idle vac reading is ~16&quot; and the dwell and timing are spot
on (albeit the idle is high enough that it probably really isn't)  

Now since I started composing this post, I have added another symptom,
that is almost certainly unrelated (tho more annoying).  Last wedneday, on
my way back from finally picking up my MSHP engine, the van cut out and
died about 1/2 mile from my house.  The way it died, I am suspecting a
wiring problem , tho I have not run any tests (flew down to FL that
afternoon, and was *very* time-limited!). Before I seriously post
this one, I am gonna follow the advice that Al Brase offered last time
(and that was correct) and run a complete harness check before I start
whinging :-)  But if anyone has advice on how they could be linked or even
independent advice on what could be causing the high idle, by all means
toss it in early :-)
