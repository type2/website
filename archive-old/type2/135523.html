&gt;What kind of noise?  Rock in the tread?....yeah, I know, you would 
&gt;have looked for that..

I've removed the tire from the bus and it looks fine.

&gt;Wonder if the rim is cracked somewhere around one of the supports or something?

I hope not but I do have two spare factory rims.

&gt;Can you make it do it if you push the bus back and forth at a certain 
&gt;place?
&gt;
&gt;Makes the noise in a straight line or just on curves?

If I push the bus I can't hear anything abnormal. Once I'm sitting in the bus and driving I hear the noise. If I cut the engine and open the door while coasting I hear what sounds like belts and rubber.

I've had the thread separate on a previous bus tire that sat in one spot for 7 years. It wasn't pretty: I could turn tight circles in the parking lot without using the steering wheel! This tire has no alignment issues.
