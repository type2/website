Hello volks!

I had a visitor yesterday evening.  You may remember a girl named Diana from
Vancouver who was traveling down to Tennesee to pick up a bus and drive it
back.  Well several weeks ago she posted an itinerary for her return trip.
It sounded like she would be passing near Bartlesville (NE Oklahoma) so I
e-mailed her and told her if she got close and needed anything to give me a
call.  Well, she called while I was at church and my son told her to call
back in a little while (he didn't know anything about her).  She did, and I
told her to come on by.

She is driving a '66 Westy that she got from a list member in eastern Tenn.
(sorry, can't remember his name for certain).  Her story is that she had a
bus but it got wrecked (not her fault) and was looking for a replacement.
She is a &quot;poor college kid&quot; 24 years old.  She made the trip down with four
friends in a converted school bus along with her dog.  She pulled the motor
&gt;from her wrecked bus, by herself.  Stipped it down so she could stow it in
the school bus and came on down.  When she got where her &quot;new&quot; bus is, she
put the engine back together (gen, fan, exhaust, etc) and put it in the bus
with a little help from the guy she was getting the bus from.  Pretty
impressive I think for a girl.  Yeah, I know, I'm being chauvanistic, but
you don't see girls everyday who can or want to do this sort of stuff.

A neat thing, the guy she was going to buy this bus from originally wanted
$250 w/o motor.  It turned out that he gave her the bus.  I told her that
there was a precedence for this on the list (Charlie).  Anyway, she is
traveling back with just her dog.  She had the fuel pump and coil both fail
before she got out of Tennesee.  She was able to get the parts she needed at
a NAPA store (electric fuel pump and Honda coil) and get back on the road.
When she got to my house I asked if she needed anything and she said no.  I
gave her a place to camp for the night and let her take a shower and clean
up.  We stayed up late visiting and she left this morning.  I didn't see her
as I had to leave for work before she was up.  I hope she has a safe trip.

Another neat Listmember encounter.  VW Bus people are great!
