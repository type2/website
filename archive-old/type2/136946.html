Subject: First carb rebuild

I'm rebuilding my first set of carbs and as luck would have it they are the 34-PDSIT-2/3 dual Solex carbs from a 72 bus.

Disassembly and cleaning was easy. Lots of little parts but I bagged carefully and nothing got lost. I'm about to reassemble the left carbs and I'm wondering if anyone of the list with experience with these carbs can answer some questions for me. Here's the stage I'm at:

This is the kit I bought from Bus Boys (Royze appears to be some US company):

This is what came in the kit:

1) The replacement float needle valve doesn't have a ball bearing on top. I gather this is to keep it from sticking. Should I reuse the old valve as it passes the blow test?

2) The metal washer under the float valve is 0.5mm but the replacement is fibre and 1.0mm. The floats seem to be the same length from the threads down. Should I re-use the old washer if I use the new valve?

3) The choke shaft only had 1 washer/spacer. They are super duper thin. Are there supposed to be two and where can I find another. The fiche doesn't seem to list this part.

4) The diaphgam for the choke isn't the same as the original:

I believe this is the 73-74 style. Do I just mount it then remove the excess with a razor blade?

5) What are the tiny o-rings for? Are they a 73-74 item only?

6) The kit only comes with one gasket to sandwich the phenolic spacer:

It's also much thicker. Is this a new style or should there be two gaskets like the original as seen in this kit from CIP1_dot_com:

http://www2.cip1_dot_com/PhotoDetails.asp?ShowDESC=N&amp;ProductCode=VWC-021-198-573-74

I looked up the part number as 021-129-975. It's not sold separately, nowhere to be found and doesn't come in the engine gasket set.

7) The new head to manifold gaskets are now metal instead of gasket paper. Is that ok? I see the engine gasket sets come with that kind.

Thanks in advance.
