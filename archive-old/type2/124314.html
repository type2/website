Subject: Re: [T2] Saggy front suspension

Hehehe,
Yes, it must sound strange to some I'm sure!
As Andy see's regular service as a 9 seater bus, camper van and as a van
shifting lots of heavy stuff, he regularly is loaded to the GVM. As soon as
I put any weight in him he sits on the bump stops which is not good!!

No other thoughts???

Cheers,
Richard

----- Original Message ----- &gt; most wish they had your problem.. sounds to
me like
&gt; your bus likes to sit low, the way gravity intended it
&gt; to be.. if it were only my bus !!
&gt;
&gt; sagging front end i've never heard of, rear yes and
&gt; that looks cool if the front is lowered it looks
&gt; level, most bus' ride to high so im sure yours looks
&gt; better and more level..
&gt;
&gt; good luck,
&gt; rob
&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; Andy is getting a little saggy in the front end.
