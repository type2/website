Subject: sunroof bus

hey list,

just wanted to share the jubilation I'm feeling about owning another bus. I plan to offer someone 150.00 today for a complete 79 7 passenger sunroof bus here in california. sign on it says 200 obo!

It's been sitting for 11 years and has everything in it and some extra stuff too.

found out about the bus on the day of welcoming my first a.i.r.s. list camper, a girl named amanda traveling to l.a. from montana.

A good day for busma.

Let you know about it later.

Busdriver X
