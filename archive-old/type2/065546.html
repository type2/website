Subject: What year is my Vanagon?

My Aircooled Vanagon GL was manufactured  10/82 but the paperwork lists it as an
'83 and it is considered an '83 for purposes of emmissions standard.   What I
want to know is:  What do those in the know (listmembers) consider it to be?
'82 ir '83.  And does anyone know when the last aircooled model was made.
