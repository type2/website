Subject: Re: [T2] Should I install that caliper ?

Thanks so much for your answer. It gives me the energy to continue my quest 
of a properly rebuilt 71-72 right brake caliper.

There is no way I will buy a caliper with only one bleeding screw going at 
the bottom. I will not pay for a rebuild and suffer the rebuilder's mistake 
for the next 30+ years.

Now I remember Scott Lyons telling me that rebuilding a caliper was not for 
the faint of heart, what about purchasing one rebuilt ...

Don, best wishes for your trip to Denver.
