agreed  -  the point of interest in what I reported is the  
unusual cause viz. blockage of cooling-air intake


&gt;  it  could be that the water injection caused a lean condition.

unheard of  -  WI decreases temps without changing mixture  
(if put in after the petrol, which is where I do it)


&gt;   on rebuilding the motor you would be better off getting a set of 
&gt;rods  that have been rebuilt

no hint of harm to rods, so we're  slapping in new big- &amp; 
small-end bearings, i.e. rebuilding the rods  ourselves





hello Robt     You will find rebuilding the rods  yourself way more time 
required than buying ones already done.  Air  blockage probably didn't cause this 
problem.  Laws of probality says  anything is possible therefor it is possible 
WI caused problem, might be a  slight chance but still possible after all it 
does clean all the carbon off  everything also. I haven't even seen a picture 
of the piston's hole but I do  know what causes this to happen  later  mark
