My only concern with a &quot;normal&quot; fire detector (err, smoke detector,
I guess; presumably you're talking about the kind that you would put
in your house?) is that the normal heat associated with an engine
compartment (esp. in hot weather driving) might set off a false alarm
and dump fire retardant into your engine compartment for no reason (I
doubt that would be good for an engine :-)

...I think I'd rather pull the cable manually :-)

Hm, I guess there's another issue... &quot;normal&quot; fire detectors are
9V, so either you're dealing with the 9V battery, or you add the
necessary transformer to provide a 9V circuit.
