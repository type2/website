Hello List!!!	


  Well, as Charlie Ford pointed out, I neglected to inform everyone were
the 76 is located. If you don't remember, it is a 76 T2, body in pretty
good shape, with the normal surface rust, no middle seat, rear seat in good
condition, fronts are so-so, the motor and tranny has been spoken for, the
windows are all there, and I'm asking $150 for it.

 The bus is located in Oklahoma City (put the location in this time!!!!)
