Subject: RE: [T2] timing mark!

Ed said: &quot;I have looked at the stuff on line, read the books and can not
find a timing mark on the pulley of my 72.&quot;

OK, Ed, since you looked at the stuff on line, then you must have seen this
picture:

http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/FindTimingMark.html

I found it under a google search  ==&gt;&gt;   &quot;timing mark&quot; site:ratwell_dot_com

The timing mark is a very, very slight 'V' cut into the edge of the pulley,
at the 'inside' part that is very difficult to see.

You can best find the timing mark with your finger nail in the indicated
area .  If not, then traverse the WHOLE INSIDE (inside) edge of the pulley
with your finger nail.  If it is any other area (it could be 90 - 180 - 270
degrees off) then you will have to pull the fan and reset your fan belt
pulley to match the instructions on the Ratwell site.

Good luck.


PS, are you saying what I think you are saying when you say::

&quot; Any advice on this procedure.
  I am pulling the few hairs I have left out!!!&quot;
