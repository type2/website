&gt; I received a rediculous quote on the weekend to paint my bus.  It was

Not ridiculous at all....and anyone who's ever done an even medium quality
paint job on a bus would tell you the same.

If you WANT a poor quality paint job, take it to someone who /wont/ spend
a week to disassemble, prep, mask, another week to shoot primer, smooth it
out, shoot it again, clean it all up, remove the mask, remask for color,
shoot a few coats of color....then put it all back together.

Maaco will probably do it in about a day for 500 bucks or so. (at least,
when we had a shop Astro painted, thats what it cost.  Had white window
rubber, a white trailer hitch, white inner wheel wells, white spotted
tires, white radiator, white lower frame rains....good thing I'd removed
everything that bolted on...else we'd have had a white sunroof frame and
seal, a white grill, white tail lights....probably a white license plate
too.  And spots of that paint job (door handle recesses) were peeling in 2
weeks.)



&gt; Obviously, this vw shop didn't need the business.

Or perhaps they have a reputation for doing good work and dont want to
spoil it with econo paint jobs.

&gt; Some kind of interim paintwork done by me is starting to sound like a
&gt; better idea all the time.

Nothing wrong with that at all.  I spent a week removing body filler, old
paint, old primer and a LOT of rust from the drip rail on the '66 all
around before I shot it with about 14 dollars worth of paint. (just 8&quot; up
from the drip rail and around it to the sides....a few other spots on the
roof where the rust had caused it to peel back as well.)

I've also got a '79 Rabbit that my brother is learning to do paint and
body on.  It was pretty surface rustyed...had a few pinholes to patch.

I'm sure he'd attest as well to the amount of time even a small car such
as that can consume.
