&gt;I have not been all the way trough it thought , there were not enough clearance at the end.

LOL.

I had the same problem at the Chandelier Tree with my '75 over Memorial Day.  They need 
to either clear out the dirt/gravel/stuff in the bottom of the opening or fix their sign.  I 
measured the Bus before trying, and I *should* have had a good 2&quot; to spare... but didn't
make it any farther through than you did.
