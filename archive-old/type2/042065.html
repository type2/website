&gt;I was wondering if anyone out there can tell me if I can get a roof 
&gt;rack (for bikes) for my 79 Westfalia? Would one fit even though it is 
&gt;a pop-up? Currently I am running Yakima on my Jetta, 


I've been using Yakima &quot;Bronco Brackets&quot; bolted through the side of the pop top, two on each side with the standard Yakima towers attached to them.  Have to use a stool to be able to reach high enough to place and remove bicycles, but never had any problems.
