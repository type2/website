&gt; Again beware of the integrity of the outlet pipe on the tank. I had to

&gt; solder another bit in. Naked flames and gasoline fumes are not a good
mix in

then Harmon replied:

       Hmmmmm ---- I believe the correct method for dealing with this is
to
fill the tank with water first. At least that's what they taught us in
automech
class.


Then Brooks got in his two cents:

An old welder showed me this one: Empty the tank and blow it dry with
air - then stick the filler hose tube on the exhaust pipe of a *running
vehicle* leave it on for five minutes or so,remove it and  do your
welding. The carbon monoxide being heavier than air will completly
displace any OX in the tank -No OX- NO FIRE - This is foolproof .I have
used it many times on auto and bike tanks.
