Subject: ECU faulty?

Anyone had the ECU go out or be faulty on their bus?
What are the possible symptoms?

My 78 project bus has some strange electrical things going on with the fuel 
injection system and I know that after testing everything else you should 
look into changing out the electrical control unit.  I don't want to invest 
in it unless I have a pretty good idea this is the problem.

I have good fuel pressure and spark at every plug.  The AFC unit seems in 
working order and turns the fuel pump on when the flap is opened and there 
is power to the fuel injectors, but no spray???

Hmmm....
