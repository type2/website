Subject: and the spark plug went POP

So I'm on Whidbey Island up here in Seattle last Sunday. The engine is
running terribly rough and so I pull over to find out that the last mechanic
I brought the van to set the timing at 5 degrees before TDC instead of 5
after (and my timing scale even has the red dot marking 5 after)... After
resolving to never ever bring business to that mechanic again we fix it up,
and head off to the musical sound of a well running vw engine... while
driving up a hill all of a sudden comes a loud POP from the back and I
immediately lose power... now I had the radio on so I couldn't hear the
engine that well and all I could think was thrown rod or dropped valve... I
kill the engine and coast over to the side... walk around to the back and
check the heat... engine doesn't feel like it's too hot, but the dipstick
does feel a bit warm... I try turning over the engine (after disconnecting
the coil) and it turns over fine with no nasty clanky noises. So I go back
to check the engine and notice that one of my spark plug wires is hanging
loose. sure enough there's a plug attached to the end with stripped threads.
Only the bottom two rings of thread are dark nd stripped though (the bottom
two by the electrode), the rest of the threads look a bit white and ashy, as
if THEY WERE NEVER THREADED IN!!!... so this bone-head mechanic that set the
timing wrong also cross-threaded my plug and didn't get it all the way in...
Anyway moral of the story is after filing the mush out of the plug and
trying to reinstall it (with fingers crossed that I could get it into the
head) I ended up calling AAA for a tow... back to seattle... over the
ferry... at 9:30 at night...

So the moral of my story? I'll never let a mechanic touch my van again
unless a spend a lot of time getting to know them and their work...

And a question: Now I've called Time-sert looking for a way to fix the hole
(and time-serts seem to be the best way to go, according to word on the
list), and found out that the insert will cost about 3 bucks but the tools
will cost 94, I wanted to see if anyone in the Seattle area might have the
toolset and be willing to part with it for a day for 10 bucks, or a beer, or
come tap the head with me, or at the least give me advice on the best way to
do the operation...

Thanks!
