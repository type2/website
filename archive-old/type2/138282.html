Subject: Re: [T2] Yep, it's a PCV valve ... sort of

That's starting to sound good. Aren't most PCVs just jammed into a 
grommet in the rocker covers? Maybe, with some investigation, a grommet 
that fits both the steel breather box and the valve might turn up.

&gt; It shouldn't be too difficult to replicate the case breather.. form a 
&gt; base plate from 1/2&quot; plastic and thread it with a stock PCV valve that 
&gt; has appropriate vacuum line fittings. Glue a pair of plastic tabs onto 
&gt; the base plate to emulate the height of the original metal box you can 
&gt; continue to use the stock bale to keep the valve in place, or you 
&gt; could just goop it into place permanently with an appropriate gasket 
&gt; adhesive.
