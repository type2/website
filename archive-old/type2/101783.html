Subject: Re: [T2] Just got a no seatbelt ticket... has there been a
  study done  saying that belts in a bus would do nothing to prevent
  injury?

I hope this isn't your legal defense.  

&gt; It seems logical to me that if
&gt; your already, as Muir put it, strapped like an
&gt; Aztec sacrifice to the front of the bus, 

Well, you're not strapped to the front of the
bus, but rather inside the front of the bus.  If
you didn't wear a seatbelt, you could have your
wish and end up between the front end of your car
and the front end of the other car (or immovable
object).  And the laws of physics say that once
your bus is no longer moving at 55mph (or 70 mph
for you guys with those low profile tires and 009
dizzies), that YOUR BODY IS STILL MOVING AT 55
MPH.  It will move into the dash, steering wheel,
and perhaps out the widshield at that speed if
given the chance.  

I used to be a paramedic in my younger days--it's
a young persons job as older people don't take
the lack of sleep or wear and tear on their
bodies nearly as well-- and probably around
10,000 EMS calls.  Many were car wrecks.  Almost
ever car wreck fatality involved someone who
wasn't wearing a seatbelt and was ejected or
received cardiac damage from stiking the steering
wheel.  Rarely did someone who was wearing a
seatbelt experience serious injuries.  

Besides, the cops don't give a damn how logical
you think it is.
