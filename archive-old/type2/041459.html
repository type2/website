Subject: Trim screw sizes

Hello all!

The restoration on my '70 Westy is going to be
finished soon, and I'll be spending a lot of time
putting all the pieces back together again.

When I took it all apart I noticed that most of the
exterior pieces like turnsignals, side reflectors,
back-up lights and the like were put on with all
different sizes of screws.  Some pieces used two
totally different types of screws to hold the same
part on.

Can anyone send me a rundown of all the exterior parts
and what size of screw used to install them.  The list
is as follows:

Front, side reflectors
Rear, side marker lights
back-up light housings and bulbs
turnsignals

Once I know what sizes I need, I'll go to the hardware
store and pick up some good stainless steel pieces.

Thanks in advance!
