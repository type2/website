 I stand corrected - the following from the Westfalia Camper Info &amp; Buyer's Guide (on the Bus Depot's Web site):

1976-1979
These last years of the bus were its most modern...A much roomier layout was achieved by placing all the cabinetry behind the driver's seat, leaving open space behind the passenger seat (which now swiveled to face the rear).

Vanagon
1980-1983
...both front seats swiveled.
