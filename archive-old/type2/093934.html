Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line cutoff alternative

Went to the manufactures site and noted that in their catalog most of 
their fuel cutoff devices and connects have max engine sizes that are 
smaller than our vehicles.
Holley makes a couple but they are mucho money.  Used them back when 
racing.

&gt; Happy Friday all
&gt; In the year or so I have been on this list it seems that
&gt; the subject of how to stop the gas from flowing when
&gt; removing fuel lines has come up at least 3 or 4 times. I
&gt; have been meaning to post this info for some time and
&gt; today I finally got around to it.
&gt; While perusing one of my motorcycle catalogs (Chapparral
&gt; at http://www.800-841-2960_dot_com/) I saw these nifty Quick
&gt; disconnect couplings that shut off fuel flow when you
&gt; pull them apart. They are claimed to be compatible with
&gt; all types of gas or racing fuel and come in 1/4(part#306-
&gt; 1229 $13.99) and 5/16(part#306-1230 $14.99) sizes (kinda
&gt; strange since most of the bikes that this catalog caters
&gt; to are metric. They are made by Motion Pro and can
&gt; likely be ordered through any motorcycle shop.
&gt; I haven't used one myself so no firsthand knowledge.
