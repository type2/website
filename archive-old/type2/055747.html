Subject: OCTANE for type2 life

Here is some official octane info for those that care to read it. This comes straight from a pamphlet from the A.S.T.M. ( american society for testing and materials. This is not meant to critisize, ridicule, harrass,or de-mean anyone. It is not meant to pump me up in any way. It is for education and to de-myth certain items that have been posted. Briefly as we can::The most common measure of gasoline quality guidelines are established by the ASTM. Currently, ASTM D 4814 is the standard for automotive spark ignition fuel. Gasolines are most commonly rated based on their antinock index (AKI)., a measure of octane quality. The AKI is a measure of a fuel's ability to resist knock (ping). The AKI of a motor fuel is the average of the research octane (RO) and motor octane (MO). R+M / 2. This is also the number posted on the yellow and black decal on the gas pump. The RO of a fuel is typically 8 to 10 numbers higher than the MO. For instance, 87 octane fuel has an RO of of 92 and an !
MO of 82. Now there is lots more but I think we get the idea. Here is what I think about this. ( for what it's worth). My gas filler door says MINIMUM 91 OCTANE. This is a 69 bug. OOOPS. Anyhoo, it's stock and it pings on regular. Have you ever gone up a 6% grade in the back of your bus and listened to the motor ( I do this with customers cars so I can REALLY hear what's going on. It might scare you into believing that pennies saved at the pump add up to dollars spent on loose heads,pulled case studs, burnt pistons etc. Your motor is a long ways away from you and insulated by lots of who knows what. Pinging is masked by all sorts of engine noises. OK enough from me. There it is in black and white. From the ASTM. I'll take their word for it. Thank you. Jim Duncan  OUT.
