&gt; well.. since the motor is a flat-4, all the oil drains out of the lifters.
&gt; It usually goes away in about 4-5 seconds. Well.. this time, it lasted for
&gt; about a minute or so. I took it for a drive, thinking it would quiet down.

just so you know. all the oil doesn't drain from the lifters. The
design of the engine lends itself to having lifters bleed down more
often, but it is not designed in such a way that all the lifters bleed
down all the way.

&gt; It sounded like it quieted down, so I parked the Bus. Then maybe a minute
&gt; later, I started it back up again, and it sounded perfectly normal.

see above.
 
&gt; Any idea what's going on? 

this is normal. They just bleed down sometimes. My 79 has a worn out
2.0l in it. Every morning my lifters rattle a bit before pumping up.
Sometimes it took several minutes to get them to pump up.  

&gt; I'm guessing obviously that one of my lifters
&gt; wasn't getting oil. I checked my oil on the dipstick and it's still VERY
&gt; clean. Could this be a symptom of a clogged oil filter maybe?

I don't really think that your oil filter is anything to worry about,
but you have changed it at sometime in the past to confirm that it's
been changed at a regular interval? right?

&gt; On a side note, I'm using 10W-30 Castrol Synthetic. Should I be using 40
&gt; weight oil? Most motors are specifically designed for a type of weight oil..
&gt; like I know the small block chevy uses 40 weight oil... and the V6/60 uses
&gt; 30 weight oil. So what does the flat-4 use? Or I guess the better question
&gt; to ask is, what kind of oil did it come with from the factory?

now Todd, you know speaking the O-word is a sure fire way to get
people all excited in the morning :)

I ran 40wt in my 79 untill I got my leakes fixed. After that I ran
20w-50 synth. I run such a heavy oil just for the reason you mentioned
at the first. my lifters bled down a lot less w/ heavy oil. But unless
it happens all the time I would just stay w/ the 10w-30 since it is a
recently rebuilt engine (even if it is GEX :(
