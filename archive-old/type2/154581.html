Subject: Re: [T2] Crane XR700 / SVDA

Darren, I also have this setup, and Crane Cams told me I could open my plug 
gap up to .045 from the stock .028. I haven't tried it yet, but they should 
know what they're talking about. I am going to do this tomorrow, as it's 
spring break, and I've got the week off.
Courtney


&gt; Well, I finally got around to installing my new SVDA (aircooled_dot_net) and a
&gt; Crane XR700 points replacement this week.
