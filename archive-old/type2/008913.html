Steve,  gotta put some 9oth grade electricity knowledge to work here -since
this is all logic and no hands on testing, anyone feel free to say &quot;whoa!&quot; here!:
     The diagram shows the altitude controller as a variable resistance
device with leads going to 6, 9, &amp; 12 of the ECU.   12 seems to be a unique
input for this device (ground?); 6 &amp; 9 are also the inputs for the intake
air sensor (volume of air flow measured by resistance changes as flap
opens).  Since the diagram shows the altitude circuit IN PARALLEL with the
air flow curcuit, (runs across it) it must serve to decrease the resistance
(can never increase it)- The book lists the range of value for the
resistance between 6 and 12 as 200-2000 ohms, and 1000 to 10,000 ohms
between 6 and 9.   Given that the gas flow is metered according to the
amount of air the ECU is led to believe is coming in, and since more oxygen
is needed for the same gas at high altitudes, the system must either give
less gas or more air.....obviously it must give less gas (leaner mix) at
high altitudes, ie, be fooled into thinking the volume coming in is LESS-
which it must do by lowering the resistance in the air flow curcuit?  Your
altitude switch, if installed by someome, probably did this.  It probably
cut out at &quot;LOW&quot; and put a resistor across at &quot;HIGH&quot;....did you find
anything with a resistor in this wiring, either fixed or variable?
Reversing the labeling should leave it normal at high altitude (running
rich) and falsely running lean at low??   MB
