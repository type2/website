Subject: Re: [T2] Scratching sound on acceleration

Hi Greg

thanks for ideas.  I tried to test as you suggested and IN neutral, 
there is NO noise with the clutch pedal down or up.  So its only when 
in gear, and under load of accelerating, ie when I just tap foot on 
gas. And it doesn't take a moment for the noise to start, and just as 
quickly stop when I take foot of gas.   This is all under slow city 
driving which is all I've done this year, so yes, the clutch has had 
a hard time with constant changing.

My thoughts are now &quot;could the transmission be dry or an  axle or 
something?&quot;  I'd really like to be able to understand it a bit before 
I take it in. btw I've  dismissed it as being the acc. cable housing 
as the noise stops on de-clutching.

-John
