Esteemed List-Volk:

From the Bench Racing file - I call Hog Wash on the &quot;painted/coated rims
won't loosen up, must be lack of torque on the nuts/bolts&quot; Hog Wash...

I've been recently tasked with building a class winning 1600 SP motor
for some friends racing in SCORE-International's Class 9 category - have
a copy of the 2003-2006 Rules and Regulations handbook right at hand.
And I quote from CR12 (Competition Regulation 12) Wheels and Tires:

&quot;...It is highly recommended that all paint be removed from the mounting
surfaces of the rim and hub. (Paint burns, blisters, and peels, allowing
the lug nuts to loosen.)...&quot;

I would posit that one of the premier off-road racing sanctioning bodies
knows a thing or two about how things get to loosen up - know what we
means, jelly-beans?  Personal experience dictates SEVERAL regular
re-torques of the fasteners on freshly prepped rims, which is what I
perceived as the problem with the Trashed Splittie epic.  The freshly
refinished rims were mounted up and the owners took off on a road trip
to attend some bus event and failed to recheck the torque.  End of
lesson some 400 miles later.

OBC - if you ever happen to strip down the impeller on a Type 4 motor
for cleaning/painting, please do make sure that you remove as much paint
as you can where the two pieces bolt together, and don't use any
thread-locking product on the four fasteners.  It's very interesting to
note how much torque gets &quot;disappeared&quot; when the two pieces rub through
the fresh paint on each piece :-0

Happy Friday
