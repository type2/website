yep, i did a compression test--all four are 120-125psi.  vacuum is an
even 17psi.

cylinder #4 is now totally dead; and the noise has gone away.  so, #4 is
the 
culprit, but why?

ideas?
No spark on #4?
Exhaust valve stuck shut? Just sugesting it, because I can't think of 
anything else that would leave you with compression. The noise could have
been the rocker arm slipping sideways, or disintigating?
