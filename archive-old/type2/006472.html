How about using the POR-15 fuel tank sealer kit?  Supposed to be impervious
to anything short of a small nuclear blast.  The kit includes cleaning/prep
chemicals, sealer, and a supply of their own fuel treatment/conditioner.

I have no personal experience with the POR-15 fuel tank kit, but their other
products seem to live up to their claims.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Just my opinions, a lot of people have gotten bit by this in the past
and the products they used claimed nothing on earth would dissolve them
at the time they put em on.  You can't predict the federal government.  &lt;&lt;
