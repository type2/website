Subject: Re: [T2] she's bleeding!

&gt; My 70 Campmobile hadn't leaked a drop of oil until i took it in for a tune
&gt; up about 2 weeks ago. While there i had them change the oil, and now i am
&gt; bleeding oil. Added up i think it has dropped about a quart. The dipstick is
&gt; still on full, and she is leaking right in front of the oil strainer cover.
&gt; Is this somthing i need to worry about? and if so, what gaskets might need
&gt; to be replaced? I am kinda looking forward to dropping the engine out of her
&gt; anyway...Gotta learn sometime :)

did they overfill it? that could have blown out a seal. or it may stop now
that the level is down.

another possibility is that you have gas leaking from the carb or fuel
pump into the crankcase. does the oil smell badly of gasoline and do you
have a strong raw gas smell around the engine.
