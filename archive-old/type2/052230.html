Subject: [T2] North Carolina Bus Club meeting 2.24.01

Hi, 

Lot's of snow and ice here in NC today. The '67 as usual did well in the snow. Just need to stay away from those salt trucks :)

On Saturday the 24th The North Carolina Bus Club (still don't have a name yet) will be meeting at Allen and Sons BBQ in Hillsborough, NC. This is located just a mile or two north of Chapel Hill. This will be a get to know each other meeting for the Triangle area. We will also be discussing plans for our June picnic and campout at Jordan Lake. 

The club is open to all owners and admirers of VW Transporters built from 1950 on. The club is free and open to all. Our mission is to keep Transporters on the road so that we may enjoy using them. The club will have two main chapters to begin with: Triangle and Piedmont Triad. The first meeting in Greensboro was a huge success and I am really looking forward to the Triangle meeting. There are directions and some links to club pics at http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~ncbus/club/

There is also a movement to start a new NC chapter of NEATO. Essentially NEATO is a national club that for 1950 to 1967 Transporters. The club has a growing presence in the Southeast.  For more info on NEATO visit http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/  I will have some applications and a copy of this latest Old Bus Review in which NC play a big role.

Membership in NEATO is $20 a year and is NOT required to be a part of the NC Bus club. Just wanted to be clear on that :)

I look forward to seeing you there (as well as a parking lot full of splits, bays Vanagons and Eurovans :)

If you have any questions please email me at ncbus_at_mindspring_dot_com

Thanks
Chris
