Subject: Re: engine failure

That piece looks to be the part of the right half case stud that holds up
the oil sump.  You cannot overtighten the oil sump plate or that will occur.
I can pretty much guarantee you that your right case half will look like
this:

I would imagine that that piece may have found itself in the wrong place
somewhere in the engine, but
you prolly won't know until you split the case.

Don't even ask how I learned about all this.&lt;grin&gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have a couple questions,,
&gt; &gt; If a couple lifters collapsed.. what would the engine drive like?
&gt; &gt; 74 Westfalia Camper with a 2 liter hyd engine
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was heading home this weekend from a terrific camping event at Warsaw
&gt; Caves in
&gt; &gt; Ontario..  Da' Caves 2005  when I ran into catastrophic engine
failure...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I wasn't far from home when it happened.. and for no apperant reason....
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; started to make a terrible racket...and  loose power , no smoke,, full
oil
&gt; &gt; pressure, nothing out of the ordinary other than a very noisy engine...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Travelling at 100kmhr for about 2hrs,, fairly flat terrain,, very light
&gt; &gt; headwind.. CHT normal.. 400 degF  much less load in the camper than I
&gt; usually
&gt; &gt; have... and booom!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It was as loud as all the hyd, lifters had collapsed.. or a valve head
or
&gt; seat
&gt; &gt; had dislodged.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The engine rev'ed up but didn't want to put out power....
&gt; &gt; I did a compression test..  145psi.....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I pulled the engine...
&gt; &gt; I pulled the heads off,, removed the valves,, and they are in perfect
&gt; shape!
&gt; &gt; I pulled the hyd lifters and found 2 where not pumped up now.. 2 days
&gt; later... I
&gt; &gt; dunno if that makes a difference..
&gt; &gt; No signs of damage on the lifters.. cam lobes,, or anything I could see
&gt; into the
&gt; &gt; case.
&gt; &gt; I pulled the cylinders and noticed a nick in a piston skirt...
&gt; &gt; when I pulled the cylinders... I found a part floating around inside....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; can you tell me where it comes from... and any ideas why it broke...
&gt; etc....
&gt; &gt; here is a picture,,,
&gt; http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/pictures/MVC-368F.JPG
&gt; &gt; I havn't split the block yet.. I do know where the piece belongs and
will
&gt; update
&gt; &gt; this with more pictures and info.. I just wanted to see if you can shed
&gt; more
&gt; &gt; light on the topic...
