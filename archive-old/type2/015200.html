Subject: Chatting and IRC
Mime-Version: 1.0

I am here to protest us having to use the same chat room as those damn
watercooled jetta freako commy bastards that is on efnet.  Those have to be
the most boring individuals in the world, not to mention the universe.   I
have met bricks with more personality than those freaky geeks.

I know they think they're cool with there lowering kits, booming stereos,
and dice hanging from the rear view of their Golf, but believe me these are
not the VW owners that wave at other VW owners.

Sure, every now and then you run into a good aircooler in there, but not
often enough.  

Can't we all just go back to the way it used to be when we were on
azaccess. Mind you not many showed up but damned if we didn't have some
good discussions.

I know I sound angry, but I'm not really, just frustrated.  Anyone got any
solutions, suggestions, etc.  Isn't there another way we could do this?

Charlie
