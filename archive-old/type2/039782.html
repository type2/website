Subject: Re: Cup Holders in Bus

    The PO of my bus took the bottom half of a heavy plastic bottle and 
screwed it directly behind the drivers seat.  I find it very convenient and
nothing has spilled yet.  It is also kind of hidden so it doesn't mess up
the appearance of the dash.  I thought of putting one behind the passenger
seat too but then my seat would no longer swivel which is a priority.  Just
my $.02 on this topic.
