Subject: Re: Push rod tube seals.

Replacing push-rod seals is not tough, just finished doing mine. 
Remove lower tin piece to gain access to tubes and be able to clean 
where tubes go into case.  The o-ring diameter on the head is larger 
than on the case, so it will pull straight out.  Be sure that wire 
spring thingy is pushing against end of push rod after installation.

Mick, the following is NOT intended to scare you off, just what NOT to 
do when doing this relatively easy job.

All right, it's time for me to fess up my MAJOR booboo of two days 
ago.  I was installing new pushrod seals.  Everything was going well, 
tubes came out with just finger effort, didn't need my special tool.  
Tubes cleaned up easily, no major dents that would affect sealing. 
(next time I might install new tubes though)
Put everything back together and started up engine.  OIL LEAK at 
cylinder 2 pushrod area.  

WARNING : THE FOLLOWING MAY UPSET SENSITIVE VW READERS
DUE TO IT'S GRAPHIC NATURE




If you don't get things seated properly, when the engine is started 
the rod will come out and, not finding the push rod, will continue 
it's travel and wedge itself between the steel rocker arm and the 
aluminum head, guess which looses.  The head shying away from the 
mighty push rod, cracked and allowed lifegiving oil to drain from the 
head.  AND since I didn't seat both push rods on same RA, I got a 
pair of cracks from the valve cover to about 1 inch inboard.  The 
push rods were a little scarred, but I polished them.  How straight 
do they have to be?

I cleaned up the oil mess, removed RA, plugged push rod tube, and 
proceeded to get to work.  Cleaned cracks with electronics cleaner. 
Gently pounded triangular shaped chunk back to near proper position.
Ground out about 1/16 deep throughout crack on outside of head, 
cleaned again. Allowed to dry overnight and applied good ol' JB weld. 
I only applied it to outside of head.  I was apprehensive about 
putting that stuff inside head and getting any loose pieces into 
engine or oil passageways.  Should I have JB Welded inside head too?
Then I filed/polished  the area to get a straight surface for the 
valve cover gasket to seat upon.

So far it has held up.  Stupid Stupid error, trust me, you don't want 
this to happen to you.  Double check your work.

Make sure that when re-installing rocker arms that the rocker arm and 
push rod are in proper contact with each other.  Tip: as you are 
installing the RA push the lower end onto the push rod.  Before fully 
tightening RA bolts, check that push rod is in socket on RA.

&gt; The push rod tube seals on my 2litre type4 engine are leaking
&gt; badly and need replacing. I have been informed this is an easy
&gt; job only taking a few hours, ie rocker assembly off, rods out,
&gt; tubes out, new seals, reassemble, reset valve clearances.
&gt; 
&gt; on all baywindows, and thats what I'm use to.  I would be very
&gt; gratefull of any advice, I am sceptical about pulling the tubes
&gt; through the cylinder head.
