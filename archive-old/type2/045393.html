Wouldn't miss it for the world, biggest VW festival in Europe.
I'll be there with my '73 Devon, Sumatra green beneath with Pastel white on
top TH0 710M.
Anybody on the list that's there look out and say hello.
Better not find too many must buy parts since I'm off round Europe after the
festival.

Next weekend (15-17 September) is VW Euro weekend. See http://www.vweuro.nl
for details. Lots of things to do and plenty of LOAFs to see. I will be
there with the '69 Clipper. Anyone from this list going ?
