Subject: Storing parts...

I'm in a quandary (No, that NOT some little British car...)

I am a hard working stiff, unfortunately with other 
interests and demands on my time. But, I have been 
rebuilding my '71 Bus from the ground up over the last month
or so. I was cleaning, painting, re-bearing the front hubs, 
etc. I finished painting the hubs and pounding in the races,
when I realized that I would not be able to install the hubs
for another couple of weeks. Same deal with the newly turned and
painted rotors. Now, both parts have to sit on the shelf 
for a couple of weeks before installation.

What should I pack parts in before storage? I figure that
a smearing of wheel bearing grease on the hubs will keep the 
insides from rusting. But, if those hubs have to sit for 
a month, will I have anything to worry about? I don't want
pitting on the new races.

I know I should clean most parts that come from the factory, so
I washed the new wheel bearings in hot soapy water to remove the
cosmoline from the bearings, and smeared them with wheel bearing
grease. But, how long can I let that grease sit on there before
I have to reclean the part and regrease?

My problem is, when I DO get a chance to work on the car,
it may only be a couple of hours, not long enough to 
wash, dry, relube, and install the new parts.

This is a problem for us 'occasional' mechanics. Even worse that
I am about to start another engine rebuild, and I am doing this
one right! (No more rebuild-in-a-weekend with a $200 kit engines
for me) But, I may balance the rods one weekend, balance the 
pistons the next weekend, mate the cylinders to the heads a 
month from then, and all the parts have to sit on the shelf 
in the interim. It will be a bigger problem when I go for final
assembly. I will try to lay aside two days for the final assembly,
but if I have to stop in the middle, I dont want parts rusting
or pitting on me. Cleaned of all trace oil, parts rust fast enought to watch.

My apologies for the length, I have a preponderance for rambling.
