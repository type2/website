Subject: Welding Body Panels- To Overlap or Not?

Hey guys...

Looks like a great weekend to work on the bus and my new body panels 
awaiting installation.  I've been researching body metal replacement, seems 
to be several different opinions (of course).  I need to know which is best: 
to leave an inch or so of the original metal and overlay the joint -or- cut 
the orginal metal so the replacement part fits in like a puzzle piece?
What do you guys think?

Also, what type of grinding tool would you use to smooth the seams?

Thanks,

Tom
