Subject: Re: [T2] the Little Brakes that wouldn't (the punch line) 

At 01:51 AM 7/7/2002 -0600, Mick asked:

&gt; &gt;I guess that's where I left off six years ago
&gt;
&gt;Why did you stop?

House remodel got in the way.  In fact, I oughtta' be on the roof instead
of working on this bus..........but we need a bus, and it can be at the
body shop while I'm on the roof.  That's the official excuse, anyway.

&gt; &gt;Isn't it amazing how the brain fades with years of drug
&gt; &gt;abuse and abnormal sexual practices?
&gt;
&gt;Umm... I don't remember.

Funny how that is.  Isn't it?  8o}

&gt; &gt;When I figure out where I stashed the seat belts, ten years ago,
&gt; &gt;I can venture out onto the road.
&gt;
&gt;Just change the fluids.

All fluids changed.  Seat belts located.  Now there's just the oil light
that won't go out.............swapped in two new pressure switches
without result.  I don't suppose the full-flow filter could be responsible
for that?  Sticking pressure relief valves?

Rik                                                       Searchlight casting
'70 Westy &quot;The Carcass&quot;                             for faults in the
...........be on the road in no time.               clouds of 
delusion.   R. Hunter
