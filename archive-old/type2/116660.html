Subject: Relay

Hi all.

My thanks to those who've given advice on my double relay dilemma, and 
especially Richard Atwell for being so patient and helpful.  Every place I 
go, I run into the same thing.  &quot;We don't know what that is.&quot;  &quot;You need the 
part with 11 wires on it.&quot;  &quot;This is not anything that goes where you say it 
does.&quot;  The list goes on.

It occured to me, since this is a fuel injection motor (76 Bus) that has 
been converted to the awful two barrel, could the other 6 wires have been 
for the fuel injection and thus removed from the van, and an earlier relay 
put in its place?  To reiterate, there are five pins, one wire comes in from 
the battery, one wire goes out to the coil, one wire goes out to the fuel 
pump, and the other two wires disappear into a harness.

Thanks again for any help.  I really hope to have this solved soon.  I'm 
about ready to run wires and switches of my own just to be able to drive.(I 
know, I really don't want to do that)


Mike
