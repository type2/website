Subject: Re: [T2] themostat hight again

Test it with a torch to see if it works..................the height thing
does not matter for you can adjust the cable.

&gt; Dear list I have been repairing the thermostat on my 76 1800cc type 4, I
know
&gt; the height it should be at 80c but can anyone tell me the height at room
&gt; temperature?                 Thanks Mel

The trouble is that the bracket that supports the thermostat restricts how 
far it can expand and thus the range it can open the flaps. Thanks for your 
post but can the question still stands.
                                                                              
           Thanks Mel
