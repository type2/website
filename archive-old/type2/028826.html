&gt;  I have a 73' Bus   and my muffler and rear bumper are all smashed
&gt; Anyway I am looking for a bolt on exaust system ...
&gt;  I'm not to concered with quite or high performance.  Although durability
&gt;  is a must because everything rusts here in hawaii


Well, that's an easy one. My Stainless Steel stock muffler will outlast
anything else by a HUGE margin and bolts right on.  $179 including tailpipe
(not stainless), hardware, and gaskets - everything you need.  Well worth
it.
