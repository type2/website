&gt; and the inside of your 1978 Fuel Injection tank shold look like this:

I need sunglasses. Was that boiled out or POR-15'd like my tank?

&gt; note that there is no screen, just a welded in pan,
&gt; such that the gasoline
&gt; level must be higher than the top of the inside pan.
&gt; you need at least two
&gt; gallons before you get spill over into the welded in pan.

I haven't measured how much fluid it takes to crest the top of the pan but
the gas doesn't have to be above the level of the pan to reach the fuel
outlet. There are a couple of little holes in the side otherwise you'd run
out of gas with only a few gallons in the tank unless you rocked the bus as
you drove down the highway. It's possible to run the tank dry and get
stranded.
