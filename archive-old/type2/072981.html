Subject: Re: [T2] new vs old

&gt;The thing I really hate about the Bentley book is the lack of an index. I'm
&gt;sure some of us have the whole book memorized now, but having a
&gt;comprehensive index would make the book about ten times easier than having a
&gt;table on contents for each section and no index. Not very user friendly for
&gt;us simpletons...

Yeah, I'm with ya there. I've got all kinds of tabs and posties and sh!t
hanging out the sides and top, and pertinent list posts printed-out for
bookmarkers in appropriate sections. I'm gonna need a bungee cord to hold
the thing together soon. I really need to get to the stationery store and
get some of those page-edge stick-on permanent tabs for notebooks and make
my Bentley all nice and neat.
