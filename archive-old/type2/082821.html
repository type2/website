Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Tire Report

Just noticing that Agilis 61 has a load rating of
1700 lbs at 50 psi.  Probably lower if set at 40
psi for the rear and 33 psi for the front, right?
 It's the tire pressure that carries the load,
right?  So lower pressure equals lower load. 
Most of the other &quot;C&quot; rated tires have 1450-1500
psi at 50 psi load ratings.

I feel pretty safe with the Walmart Liberator's
1625 at 35psi rating.

Peace and blessings,
