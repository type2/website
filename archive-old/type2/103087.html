Subject: Correct Tires vs Good Tires?

What is the correct (or original tires) for my 72 Type 2? Is this also the 
best tire on the market today? or Are there much better tires that will fit 
my stock rims? Taking into account that I live in a mild climate (rainy) - 
Pacific Northwest.


Thanks, Phil.
