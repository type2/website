Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injectors (Autozone variety)

Here it is (I hope that it's alright to quote from the archive):

 From John Anderson: &quot;please note that around me Autozone or Advanced 
Auto
(2 chain places out of the south east) sell brand NEW injectors for $30
each.  The new style with the improved tip that is supposed to keep the
injectors clean longer and better.  They are Lucas made (Bosch bought 
Lucas
apparently though, so no jokes) and work very nicely, but don't fit
&quot;perfectly&quot; as the new injector tips are a bit shorter so they don't 
seat
quite as well.  Not a problem but you won't get by using them with old 
seals
(but new ones are included anyway.)  For $120 a set, not all that bad to
just replace along with your fuel lines ...&quot;
