Subject: charcoal canister revisited

Thanks all for the feedback, I think I know what is happening now.
Essentially, my recovered vapors are currently dumping into the engine
compartment
via that smallest hose coming out of the charcoal canister, or something to
that effect.
I am going to borrow back my bently tonight and see if I can't figure out
what connectors
I will need to get this system back in place. You know, ive had this bus
worked on by this
and that person over the past year, some of them VERY good at what they do,
and nobody ever
pointed this out to me, or said something was wrong. Its either something
that just started recently (I dont think so) or not that important of a
system to some people...

either way, if they built it with it in place, they obviousley thought it
was worth the extra money to do so, so ill follow suit.

thanks again,

Christopher

&gt; &gt; Ok, on this topic, what are those tubes/pipes/whatever that go up into
the
&gt; &gt; air intakes up on the side of the bus, and seem to connect just above
the
&gt; &gt; motor in the firewall stuff? Mine are connected to nothing at all, and
&gt; &gt; appear to be missing whatever connects them to each other, or whatever
else
&gt; &gt; they go to....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I looked around and the only disconnected hose I found came off of the
top
&gt; &gt; of the charcoal filter, perhaps this is where those two tubes should be
&gt; &gt; connected to?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any suggestions appreciatted.
&gt;
&gt; Christopher,
&gt;
&gt; Err... Umm.... ahh.... err.... I don't know?
&gt;
&gt; I am sorry, but I don't see the picture.  Are you talking in the air
&gt; intake towers at the rear corners of the bus?  These tubes... about 1/4&quot;
&gt; in diameter?  do they seem to just go up. U-turn and come back down?
&gt;
&gt; If this is them, then they are indeed part of the vapor recovery system,
&gt; along with the charcoal canister.  the tubes start in front of the
&gt; firewall on top of the  gas tank, come back to thoes loops that are
&gt; anti-siphon devices, then to the charcoal canister.  The charcoal canister
&gt; has a linked system that blows air thru it and into the intake where it
&gt; goes into the cylinders and the gas vapors are burned.
&gt;
&gt; If this is *not* what you are talking about, please post again!
