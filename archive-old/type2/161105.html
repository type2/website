Subject: Re: [T2] Burnt Exhaust valve?

&gt; Hello All. I have a 77 auto westy with a 1.8 dual carbed that is  
&gt; having trouble. I have a dead miss on cylinder 2. The plug is a  
&gt; nice brown color, the ign system is up to par. I pulled the ign  
&gt; wires off the cap until I came to the one that had no effect. I  
&gt; pulled the plug out and grounded it and it fired nicely.

Sounds like the wiring is ok...

&gt; I adjusted the valves and the exhaist and intake valve on the  
&gt; number 2 cylinder were tight. The other 3 were good to go. I've  
&gt; never had any expierence with burnt valves so I don't know what  
&gt; their symptoms are. I'm asking if this sounds like a possibilty  
&gt; before I go to pulling the head off. I have not done a compression  
&gt; test as of yet but that is next on the list as well. Any ideas?  
&gt; Thanks in Advance.

The valves are leaking so much the cylinder can't build compression.

The compression numbers on that cylinder should be low. If not  
conclusive, also perform a leakdown test and see exactly how much air  
going out the ports.

Perform those tests then pull the head.

Resist the urge to re-adjust the valves and run the engine before the  
valve breaks and ruins the pistons, cylinder and head.
