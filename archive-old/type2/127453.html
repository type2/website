Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Endplay Question

&gt; From: Doktor Tim
&gt; Endplay can only be checked with the shims and flywheel/flexplate mounted.

Sorry about the way I phrased that question, just frustrated about my email situation.

What I meant to ask was:

Is it normal to have that much travel at the crank &quot;without&quot; the flexplate/flywheel, seal, and shims installed. 2.5mm just seems like so much. I will reinstall the flexplate and the shimms tonight to see if it relieves any of that &quot;travel&quot;. Then I'll check the endplay. 

Does the flywheel or flexplate contact, via the shims, something to decrease this travel? Say like the case or main bearing?

Thanks,

Michael Knight
