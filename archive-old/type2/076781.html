Subject: Re: [T2] 009 distributor? Why not?

Please.  I hope this is a joke.  Flaming VW T&amp;A (and
HEX for that matter) is half the fun.  
&gt; [Flame bait to the effect that if it weren't a good
&gt; thing to do then there
&gt; wouldn't be a picture of it in _VW Trends_, has been
&gt; removed by our
&gt; automated flame bait removal filter, and I'm glad,
&gt; too, by cracky!]
