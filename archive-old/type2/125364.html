Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pump question

Yep, that's the fiche.  I have them labeled by actual description of the
contents, so number-wise I'm stuck with whatevers on the fiche itself.

&gt; Mike,
&gt; If the pump is built into the block then it would be
&gt; the factory style pump used on 1.7 &amp; 1.8 liter engines

Sounds about right.  The replacement engine is an 1.8L.  That said, is there
a rebuild kit for the pump, or does it require a complete replacement?

&gt; And for reference this an after market electric pump used on carburetors.

Mine is a round cylinder, but since I bought it myself I know that it's a
low pressure model intended for imports.

&gt; A '77 engine would not have a factory fuel pump on the block...

Which explains why I never noticed a pump on my old engine, a sadly worn out
2L.

&gt; Can you find out the code stamped on the engine block? It is in front of
the crankcase breather tower, usually under oil/ grime.

I'll check it tomorrow in the daylight.  Should have thought of that myself.
Thanks, Alex.
