Yes, they are steel lines with a double-flared connector,
which come in many standard lengths and have a standard fitting,
thank goodness.  There may not be one long enough for the front-to-back
of the bus, but there are joint fittings and tees and stuff.  It's just 
plumbing, but it's important to keep the relative distances from the 
MC to the wheels the same (Or so I've been told by someone in the Chevy
world.)

&gt;Also, what tools are needed for this operation, or is it possible to
&gt;buy the coorect ones already done up?

You will need a tubing bender which is a 7&quot; wrenchlike thing
with a round head, head has a groove for making smooth bends
in the line.  Also you need a 11mm flare nut wrench.  The kind
that grabs the nut on 5 sides but has an opening to get you 
over the tubing.

&gt;Anyone have any docs listing what pieces are needed, what sizes/
&gt;diameters, etc?

You may very well be able to buy pre-fitted lines.  In fact,
I would like to get the pre-fitted lines for between the two brake
cylinders on the front wheels.  It's kinda tricky to make those
bends.
