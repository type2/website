Subject: Re- replacing valve cover gaskets
References: &lt;000001c0e193$9ba99c00$7c594a0c_at_wade&gt;

Make sure the metal lip in the valve cover is clean and smooth, also the
flat surface on the head.
I put a thin coat of gasket  cement on the valve cover to keep the
gasket in place while tipping into place over the head.  It takes a
certain &quot;feel&quot; to know the cover is centered over the edges of the
head.  Because the heater box sticks out so far, it's more difficult- I
do 2 tricks to get the cover wire snapped up without displacing the
cover- 1. Grease the area on the cover where the wire rubs. 2. wedge a
piece of wood strapping between the top of the cover and the engine so
the cover won't ride up as you help it up with something like a brake
adjustor.   MB
