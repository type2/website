Subject: Found: '57 DD Walkthru

Roadtripped into Oklahoma to look for the above yesterday...and found it.
Bob, was that you I passed?

It's got a lot of rust, but if I had a trailer and the burning desire to own
a '57 panel, I'd go for it. Well, okay, I have the desire. I just don't have
the trailer and the time. It was reported to be a '56 to me. I got the VIN
number, though:  315429.

It was apparently bus number 221 for 1957, since the numbers start at
315209. Pretty low number and a little coincidental since it's a type 21.

So now for the obligatory question: Just how rare would a '57 DD Walkthru
be? What could you get for one in excellent condition (a range would be
fine)? The guy's reputed to be asking $700 for this one, but I wouldn't pay
that much and I'm almost positive that cash could talk him down. Whoever
attempts to restore this will have to put several thousand into it to get it
right...and lots of sweat equity. Front and back windows (that's all except
the doors) are missing; engine lid missing. pretty straight body, but lots
of surface rust and some rocker damage. Bound to be damage inside, but it
was grown over and I had the kids with me. For a better-condition bus I'd
have done some more investigation, but this one is beyond my current skill
level. If *I* bought it, it would have to sit for a couple of years awaiting
resto funding and a mig welder purchase.

Several other older buses there too, in various stages of disrepair. I got
some pictures for the Hall of Shame, including one disected rear torso of a
bus with bullet turn signals in the back, pushed up against a building and
used for storage.

My goal is to get the oldest, rarest bus in as decent a condition that I can
possibly get my hands onto. ...like there really was another goal to this
insane obsession. I figure along the way I'll find little gems that others
are more interested in and more capable of resurrecting.

The '62 DD is still a possibility, but the likelihood of me buying that one
is diminishing as I come to realize there are more old buses out there than
I realized.

Take care! Joe
