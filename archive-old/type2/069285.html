Subject: Fuel consumption

Hi all!

Does anyone have a bus with the 2.0l engine (69PS)? Could you tell me, how
much fuel you need?

I actually need 20l/100km (14mpg) and I think, this is a lot too much=8A One
weeek ago on the highway I only needed 12l/100km (24mpg). I underdstand,
that the consumption on short ways must be higher, but I think this is a
lot too high=8A

Any hints?

Thanx,
Nick
