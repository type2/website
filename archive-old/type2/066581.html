Subject: 8&quot; of KC Snow, Zorm goes to Work!

Hi All,

My neck of the woods in here in the KC area had 8&quot; of wet snow last night
and a major blackout that may not be fixed for several days.  Here at my
work, things are fine (underground utilities).

Last night it was 'raining' tree limbs in from the heavy snow.  Zorm the
58 Single Cab escaped damage as did Brownie Bus the 84 Vanagon, but a very
close call as a 4&quot; dia. limb just missed it.  Anyways, I jumped in the
Brownie Bus to get to work and low and behold, no clutch!  The slave
cylinder pooped out on me!  Sooo, Zorm to the rescue!  Started right up
and made it to work.  I did stop for gas, but their pumps were not
working, no electricity!  hmm.  This 'freak' of nature has been making
life rather strange.  8-/
