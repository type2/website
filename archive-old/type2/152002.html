&gt; Hello List. First post, first bus, first question.

welcome
&gt;
&gt; I was given a '72 Microbus and I was told the engine is seized. I
&gt; don't know if I believe them so I'm trying to turn the motor. I've
&gt; fixed up 3 bugs so far, and on a bug you just turn the nut on the fan
&gt; pulley and if it goes round, the engine is good to go.  A type 4
&gt; engine obviously doesn't have this nut. How can I spin the engine?
&gt;

I spin it when I need to from the Alternator nut,  might need to hold the
belt tight when turning but it usually works
