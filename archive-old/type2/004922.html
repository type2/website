I'm a bit confused about the meaning of karma. Perhaps someone can help me.

If somebody, call him Steve, had a valuable object, say a heater box (HB),
wouldn't it be unfair to him if somebody took them for free? More to the
point, if there is more than one potential recipient: which one should get
the HB? The quicker one, the neediest (how do we measure that??)? Should we
cut the HB in two? :)

Wouldn't the recipient now have lost some karma for snatching the goodies?
If Steve were altruistic, wouldn't he offer to agree on a fair price (money
or exchange), so the recipient could keep his precious karma. What's the
price of karma these days and where can I get some?   :)

Seriously, there's a fair price for things (they're just things and it's
just money, nothing more). Just as charging more than that price isn't fair,
paying less isn't fair either. It goes both ways, IMHO.

Peace (on this list),

Sami
