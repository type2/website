&gt;BTW, congratulations! I don't quite understand why you had to drive so far
&gt;South to get married (the lady is not 13, is she?) 

Either 13 or related.  Or both.  Isn't it fun being able to call your
little sister the little woman as well!  Ahh, I miss South Carolina.
Well, actually....

Is it true that the stores down there sell Happy Birthday Uncle-Dad cards?
