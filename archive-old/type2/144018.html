I've used both. The epoxy I used on reburshing a steering wheel. Works great, sands off nicely, leavesv repair undetectable when finished and painted properly.
 
The seam sealer is also good stuff. Can be used in a myriad of places.

I went through and read much of what was said in the archives about 
POR15, and just wanted to ask whether anyone has used their new 
bondo-like material, or the seam repair stuff recently.
