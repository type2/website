Dana,
The rod that controls the air flaps has a range of motion of about 1/4 of a 
turn if the thermostat is in good shape. What can happen over time is that 
the thermostat, which is always under spring tension (the one on the rod), 
stretches. If no adjustment in the wire connected to the rod is made, the 
flaps are open too far, which is a fail-safe design in that the engine is 
never starved for cooling but may be slow in warming up in cold weather. 
However, if somewhere along the line someone unwittingly &quot;adjusts&quot; for the 
stretch by reclamping the wire with the engine cold so that the flaps are 
closed, and the thermostat is stretched out due to fatigue to near the end 
of its range of motion, then the flaps can not open very far because the 
thermostat is blocked against its flange from opening them any further. 
Result, overheated engine, sometimes disasterous! So see if your flap rod 
twists about 1/4 of a turn between cold and hot. Alternatively, remove the 
tin on the right side under the engine (between the heat exchanger and the 
case) and observe whether the thermostat is totally compacted when it is 
cold (no spaces beteen the bellows segments). If not, get a new one  and 
hook it up, before you do any more driving in this heat!
