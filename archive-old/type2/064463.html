Subject: WTB: 15, 21, or 23 Window

Ok Volks, this may sound like I am asking alot but one never knows:

I am on a quest to find a Winter project now that my '57 Bug is just 
about done.  An early Bus is what I'd really like to concentrate on.
My ideal choice would be a 23-Window sunroof but I will take a 15, 21, or 
23 window.  Anything that has the rear corner windows would work.  I love 
the rear corner windows.

Here are my requirements/restrictions:

I am looking for a Bus that someone has already started working on, e.g. 
already stripped and most rust/rot taken care of.  I can replace some of 
the body panels and floors, but as a rule I don't have the patience for 
body work.

I don't require and engine or alot of the parts, I already have access to 
scores of new and used parts and my collection for an early bus is quite 
full.

Basically, I just require a sound body/chassis.

Replying via email is best bet.  Thanks!
