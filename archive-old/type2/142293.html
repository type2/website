Subject: General BD tent questions and floor vs no floor question

I am getting ready to place an order today for a tent from The Bus Depot. I
thought this would be an easy decision, but I am struggling to decide.
Actually my wife is making me struggle to decide :)

I am looking at these 4 tents. http://busdepot_dot_com/details/tents.jsp I was
thinking that the top one would be the best since it was the cheapest. But, my
wife wants a floor. So the next step up is the model with the sewn in
floor.... another $100. One option is to get the cheaper one and get the add
on room with ground sheet.

What are your opinions about camping with and without a floor in a tent? I
have not been able to camp much in my bus and have never had a tent that could
attach to it. So I can't go by my own experience. I thought that a floor would
make clean up a pain, although it would keep junk out of the bus and provide a
cleaner place to sit and relax. Does the add on room and ground sheet actually
fit well and do they do just as good as a sewn in floor? I was thinking about
a tarp until I noticed that it had a ground sheet with it.

What about the people that have these tents? How do you like them overall? IS
the quality good on them, what about setup?

Thanks,
Corbett
