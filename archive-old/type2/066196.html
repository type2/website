Bill Abbott says:

So 3 busers walk into a VWFLAPS; a barndoor owner, a splittie owner, and
a 'loafer.  They walk up to the counter and the loafer says:

&quot;I want to get a price on the complete exhaust system for a 79 bus&quot;

The parts man falls to the floor laughing, incidentally hitting his head
hard on the counter.  The fellow employee dials 911, but it was too late.
