similar situation....put new stars and anti-seize in the threads...put it
back in the backing plate, and is really hard to turn the stars.  I put some
grease in the hole and tried agin, but still hard to adjust.........I truly
do not think the rear brakes were EVER changed on my 73 until now........

Any advice would be appreciated.

&gt; volks,
&gt; i was replacing my rear drums and shoes last night. (1975 westy...non-self
&gt; adjust.)  apparently, the adjusting stars have been frozen for quite some
&gt; time (doesn't surprise me, since the PO let it sit for 2 years.)  anyway,
i
&gt; managed, with some &quot;gentle persuasion&quot;, to get the stars and nuts out of
&gt; one side (i'll still working on the other side.)
&gt;
&gt; so...here's the problem....
&gt;
&gt; on the passenger side, i have the little metal clip at the base of the
adj.
&gt; star/nut housing.  i can only assume that:  this clip provides the &quot;click&quot;
&gt; when adjusting and keeps the adjusting stars from backing out after
&gt; adjusted (and while you are driving.)
&gt;
&gt; this clip is bent down, but might be able to bend it back in place, since
&gt; it doesn't touch the stars now.
&gt;
&gt; the driver's side has NO clip.  now what?  i looked in all of my
&gt; catalogues, and i couldn't find a replacement one.  is the clip welded to
&gt; the adj. star housing?  what is the name of the housing piece?  will i
have
&gt; to go junkyarding to find another one?
&gt;
&gt; also, in all of my books, it says that i have retaining pins to hold the
&gt; drums.  i bought a hardware kit, but there are no holes in the backing
&gt; plate for the pins.  the shoes have the holes, they're just not on the
&gt; backing plate.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; thanks in advance everyone!!
