Hey Y'all,
  I have found that each car has an attitude that comes with it. I had a 
86 Dodge Shelby Charge Turbo. This thing was so fast it was a point and 
shoot, you had little time to see where you were going. I tended to 
drive fast all the time, even though I never got there any faster. I got 
rid of that car 3 months later for this reason and went back to my VW's. 
Now I have a 70 Bus( only slightly faster that a Vanagon Diesel or a 
Bicycle). I find that my attitude has changed back again. I am relaxed 
and drive slow. I keep to the speed limit and enjoy driving, instead of 
getting frustrated that I can't go faster. The Bus has mellowed me out. 
Driving slower can be a lot of fun too. I try to be a courteous driver 
and keep in mind that they think that they need to go fast so I let them 
pass if I can, safely. I also keep in mind that road rage is a problem 
in the Seattle/Tacoma area and that some people carry guns, I rather get 
there slowly alive than to be dead in a hurry. Don't let them get to 
you, enjoy owning a great VW. Its all a matter of attitude.
