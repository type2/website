Subject: 68 bus motor.

well this engine actually came out of a 411? is it?
and its fuel injected.........now im new to
volkswagens and the 68 van i have didnt have an
engine. I found another one just like for parts for
cheap and inside it...sitting inside it is this
engine.......so i was wondering if it would work in
it......
so im just not that familiar with what goes with what
yet.......Also would this engine fit in a newer bus
say..........a 76 or so?
