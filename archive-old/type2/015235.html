Hi all,
I just joined the list a couple of days ago and its been a little quiet!  I
just know I'll regret those words soon...
Anyway, I'm from Singapore and hopefully a soon-to-be-owner of a '78 double
door panel van.  Over here we dont have a lot of vans and those that are
still on the road are all bay windows.  Have never seen a split window
here!!  
Okay, time for the type 2 part of the post.  
Have any of you fitted an air con unit to your type 2?  I had a bug prior
to this and the compressor/ hoses did fit into the engine bay, but a type
2..?  Is there enough space back there?  And what bout the condensor and
stuff, where do they go? 
I'm also planning to lower the van just a leettle bit.  How do I do that?
The rear has those plate thingies right, but the front?  I read somewhere
that some cutting and welding is required, if so, could someone point me to
a url with details?

Thanks a lot!
Looking forward to hearing from all of you!

cheers
ken
Singapore
