Subject: Thanks, Steve!

Kudos (NOT cooties) to Steve Etheridge! What a really nice idea! I have
enjoyed seeing the photos of our busses (archaic &quot;Old South&quot; spelling
from an archaic old Southerner)so much! Thank you, Steve for being
interested and taking the time and trouble to do this! Neat, neat busses
everyone!
