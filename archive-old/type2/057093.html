Subject: RE:  Oil pressure senders ?

&gt;I am looking in the Rocky Moutain Motorworks catalog and there 
&gt;is two  types of oil senders , 80 and 150 PSI. Which one do I need?
&gt;
&gt;There is also a &quot;T-Adapter&quot; Did i need it on my 2000 engine ?

The 80 vs 150 depends on the gauge you get.  For a type I or type IV
motor, the 80psi is more than enough.  So I'd say that's the right one.

The switch itself is about 1.5&quot; diameter (vs about 0.5&quot; of the original)
and won't fit in the hole in the sheet metal.  VDO sells a hose
extension kit to compensate - the 12&quot; long hose screws into the case and
the switch attaches to the other end of the hose.  Costs about $25 for
the hose.  Other alternatives are to cut your sheetmetal's hole big
enough to allow the bigger switch or build your own extension.

BTW, fellow listees Jim Thompson or Ron Salmon both sell VW/VDO parts
and they're cheaper than RMMW.  I'm not associated with either, but have
had many successful dealings with both of them over the past few years.
