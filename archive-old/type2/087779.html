Hi David,

I'm about where you are in this process...


&gt;question is, can I completely assemble the engine
&gt;before I install it in my bus?

My engine came out pretty much complete (except air cleaner/AFM), but I
think it will have more clearance going back in without the distributor. I'm
going to cover the hole and make sure the engine doesn't rotate with the
dizzy out.

 &gt;Can I go ahead and install the parts of the f.i. that attach to the
&gt;engine?

I'm going to install these first...I think it would be a PITA to do inside
the engine comp.

&gt;Would it be easier to put the foam seal that goes around the perimeter of
the engine tin before or
&gt;after I install it?

Hmmm.  Good question...

&gt;I am trying to make sure that each thing that I put
&gt;back on the engine is installed correctly and in good
&gt;order. I have the alternator out and was wondering If
&gt;there is anything that I should think about replacing
or checking before I install it on my engine.

See my previous post &quot;Re: [T2] engine out, anything else to replace&quot;).  My
alternator's pretty well used, but I think I'm going to throw it back in the
fray for now.  I agonized over this, but it can be replaced without pulling
the engine if necessary.

&gt;Oh, and the thermastat flap on the right side does no
&gt;close all the way when you push it down. There is an
&gt;aluminum knob that protrudes from the shroud that
&gt;keeps it from going all the way down. Is it suppose to
&gt;be this way?

I just went out and looked at mine...it looks the same as you describe, so I
guess it's normal.

&gt;Should I install the heater boxes before or after I
&gt;install the engine? I do not have a set yet and was
&gt;wondering If I had to wait on them to install the
&gt;engine.

My exhaust/heater stuff came off before I dropped the engine, and it appears
to be much easier to install after the engine is back in.  Good Luck!
