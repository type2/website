Subject: Things are still leading to other things-a continuation....

Hi all, 

I took the day off work yesterday so I could focus on getting the bus back
together. I had spent the previous night dreaming of the bus, visualizing
everything I needed to do, and trying to infuse myself with positive karma.
I had solved the rubber fitting problem by going to my local flaps and
finding a 13mm rubber hose that had a preformed 90 degree turn in it. I cut
it down to size and Hoopdy Doopty -New fitting! (or whatever that Indian guy
from the old Underdog cartoons used to say. Or was it Go Go Gophers?)
Anyways, it worked like a champ. 

Putting the back panel on was....Hell. To put it mildly. It was one of those
jobs where you pause every so often, back out of the engine bay, and curse a
couple of good ones in sheer frustration. Then you go back in and keep
going. It took about an hour to get it back in because it just did not want
to get past the carbs. The next job was putting in the new engine seal. That
was truly a piece of cake and it looked just great sitting in place. I
really thought my motor appreciated the thought.... 

The eberspacher went in next. The big difficulty here was lining up the
exhaust pipe and getting the special clamp back on. Again it is a tight
awkward area and it took a good half hour for that. Air cleaner and the
vacuum lines went in next followed lastly by the aux. fan. Please note that
it is no fun to try to fish a dropped fan bolt and washer out from the
middle of a fully assembled engine. In fact it sucks.

I was now ready to test things out and it was here that my bad karma caught
up with me. First, the eberspacher did not fire up. Nada. This was not good
mainly because I like being warm. I played around and found that by shorting
the two wires to the temp sensor it cranked right up. So I have a wiring
issue or a problem with the sensor (most likely a broken wire).
Unfortunately, the ?/*^##¤&gt;//()! sensor is in the duct behind the %&amp;_.&gt;&lt;#¤%&amp;
back panel. Right now I'm temporarily leaving the two sensor wires taped
together until I build up my courage and endurance for this again. Maybe
next season?

The other problem is Pertronix/Distributor related. When starting the engine
cranks a bit and then stops suddenly. I'm guessing that the magnetic ring on
the distributor shaft is mis-fitted and causing a plug to fire on an up
stroke. I thought I was darn careful in installing this and lining it up on
the lobes. I guess not. 

Are there any suggestions as to the best way to fit the thing? An alignment
mark or something? If it is mis installed, do I need to go and buy a new
magnetic ring or can I possibly still use the one I've got? Distributor
wise, when I was installing the Pertronix, I was forced to rotate the
distributor maybe 180 degrees and back (as you would when setting timing but
more). That shouldn't have any effect, right; or did it? Suggestions here
are much appreciated. I want to get this baby running.

Thanks for the support and to the listees who replied to my previous post!
