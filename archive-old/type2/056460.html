Subject: FS:  two 69 buses

Have two 69 buses for sale in Albuquerque.

One green/white, original paint, some light  rear wheel well rust, rear
seat bed, fresh rebuilt 1600dp, new windshield, new tires.  $1200 obo.

Also a Tan/white, no rust but some small dent/damage areas (very
repairable), 1600dp, rear and middle seat, $800 obo.  

Both are daily drivers with clean titles.   Good runners but I'll stick
to vintage buses, thank you.  Reply by email or phone (below).
