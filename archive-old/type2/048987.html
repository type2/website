Subject: [T2] replacing sink pump

Hey all-
So replacing the sink pump in our 76 westy is a bit bigger project that we
thought. It looks like we will need to remove the whole cabinet there to be
able to connect all of the wires and put the pump back in. Does anyone have
any wiring diagrams, or suggestions on how to replace and hook up the water
pump??


Thanks much!
