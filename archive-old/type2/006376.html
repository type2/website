I am in Mobile Alabama and i have a 76 westfalia that has been sitting for 5
years, it ran when i parked it but had a leak, so i pulled the engine. It is
pretty much complete but the body is going fast, the nose is gone.  i can
hear it rusting right now.  The camper interior is in pretty good shape. If
you were thinking about converting a hardtop this would give you a great
head start. Has a great tranny. Lots of extra fuelinjection stuff.  The 2L
could be revived, but has sat out for 5 years.   If anyone is interested and
can pick it up before i change my mind, make me an offer!  Otherwise im
gonna chop it up into ebay size pieces. I would consider trades for 66 bus
or beetle stuff.
