Volks:

Two pieces of hard-won advice:
The best deal on a transmission I could find is at Kustom1 Warehouse.

I called there asking about their trannys and was referred to Rancho
Performance Transaxle, who does all their rebuilding.  It turns out that
Rancho is one of the most well respected builders in the country, in fact I
got several notes from people all over the country who build trannys for a
living who recommended them.

Here's the kicker: If you buy a stock bus tranny from Rancho, it's $425.; if
you buy the same tranny (same exact tranny, in that it's rebuilt by Rancho)
from Kustom1 it's $295.  There is, of course shipping ($38. on 90 lbs to
Indiana) and a $100. core charge, but I am amazed by this tranny.  It came
beautifully clean, included a nosecone, and shifts like a dream.  They even
included the correct throw-out bearing for my '71, which is unlike any other
year.  The tranny comes with a one year unlimited mileage warranty.

A while back someone recommended H&amp;R Booster (actually it's H&amp;R Automotive
Parts) in Dallas to rebuild brake boosters.  I sent one to Ron over night, he
sent it out today.  Total cost including COD and overnight?  $105.  

Here are the numbers:
Kustom1 Warehouse:  714-997-9893
H&amp;R:   972-286-5516

Good Luck!
