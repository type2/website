Subject: Cooper SRM II

Richard,

I got a set of Cooper SRM IIs about a year and a half 
ago.  I had a set of passenger tires which were too 
small (195/70 R14) and with an insufficient weight 
rating. I like the SRM IIs. All of my driving is on 
pavement, a little in snow (I live in MT and my BN4 
isn't working properly).  I immediately noticed a big 
difference in handling with the Cooper tires.  The bus 
was much less &quot;mushy&quot; and handled better in the high 
winds we often have here (though at 40+ mph it's still 
an &quot;exciting&quot; experience).  Hauled a bunch of bags of 
manure and other heavy stuff with the old tires and then 
hauled the remains of my old deck to the dump with the 
Coopers and really noticed the difference in load 
rating.  I was probably overloaded as far as the 
passenger tires were concerned, and with the Coopers you 
could hardly tell.

Some folks on the list don't like the SRM II highway 
tread design, opting for more aggressive appropriate 
load rated tires.  I like mine just fine; it was 
extensive off-road use and associated mud buildup that 
caused most of the rust/rot on my bus.  I just don't do 
that kind of driving.  I did notice in one of the few 
times I drove on city streets in the snow here (they 
don't salt) that the Coopers could be a little slick.

I think I paid about $80 apiece for mine; I just checked 
and they're up to $94 around here.

Good luck!
