Subject: Locate the PO of '80 Vanagon ; Hyattsville MD

Sorry for the BW:

I am trying to locate the previous owner of a baby blue '80 Vanagon camper.  
Last know whereabouts' was at a Hollywood Video store in Hyattsville MD on 
June 6, 2001 at about 7:45 PM, where they rented the Tom Hanks Video CAST 
AWAY.  (OK, OK, so I found the receipt in the '80 at a salvage yard last 
weekend ! ! !)

There was a LiMBO sticker on a rear window, and it seemed like a very nice 
camper when it was complete.  Baby blue; white camper top.

Please info me off list.

TIA
