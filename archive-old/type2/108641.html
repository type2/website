Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Weight

&gt; Can anyone tell me the gross vehicle weight of a late 70's westy with the full camper treatment?

Gross vehicle weight [GVRW] is the total of curb weight [vehicle in ready-to-drive condition] and the max
weight it can carry.

I can tell you the curb weight of my 77 deluxe Westy: 3820 lbs. Not including me....

I do not know what the max weight my bus can carry. The last printed weight spec I have is listed in the 1973
sales brochure [74 to 79 omits it!]. The 73 bus is listed as weighing 3141 lbs. and the payload weight is 1885
lbs. This would mean my deluxe Westy would be able to carry an additional 1000 lbs. so the GVRW would be
around 5000 lbs.
