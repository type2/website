&gt;the shoes did not come with the e-brake arms on two; all four shoes are the
&gt;same. take the old ones off and attach them to the new? has anybody on the
&gt;list done that before? 'cause mine are riveted, and there are no rivets
&gt;like the two i need in town. might someone suggest a replacement assembly
&gt;taking into consideration the special needs of these peculiar rivets.

Just use a good quality bolt.  I think 8mm (5/16&quot;) but it's been a long time.
Whatever fits.  Use an angle grinder or drill the head off the old rivet.
A dot
of red loctite on the bolt is a smashin idea as well, and make sure it is just
the length to get through the lever and nut, not much more.  It is a great
idea
to deform a bit of the nut somehow (whack one side with a blunt chisel good
before threading it on) or use a nylock as you don't really want to tighten it
all the way down.  I usually put the nut sitting flatways about halfway in
a vice
and crimp it a little so the bolt threads in easy 1/2 way then starts
binding up.
Makes a cheap self-locking heat resistant (nylocks melt) nut for use in just
this situation or on exhaust parts etc.  They sell versions of all metal
lock nuts
and staked nuts, etc for just these places as well, but I have 8mm nuts and a
vice.  Use a nice Grade 5 english or an 8.8 or better metric bolt BTW, not
cheeseball crap.  It isn't critical but it's damn annoying if you pull it
and it
shears some day (well it could be critical I guess.)
