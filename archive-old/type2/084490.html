Subject: My type 2 in an F 5

Hey All, 

Not sure if this is unappropriate text for 'not friday' posts, but here goes. 
As most know we here in Southern Maryland were hit pretty hard Sunday evening by what is not graded as a F 5 tornado. I live in LaPlata about a half mile or so from the enter of where it hit. 
LaPlata is flat. It's pretty bad, but me and mine faired out pretty well. A bit of damage to the house, some lost windows, trees, gutters, siding, that kinda thing, but over all pretty well. 
The shocker was this. Our cars were hit pretty badly by golf ball to baseball sized hail and debris. My corrado is wrecked on every panel. My sister-in-laws new Beetle lost its windshield, almost every panel damaged and her rear tail light. My bus (which was dentless and dingless completely) faired through it best of all with on small ding, a dent which I can put the palm of my hand into and I lost three lenses (all left side) and the rubber piece for my bumper step (it wasn't put on well). That's it. No big damage. You should see the other cars, wow are they bad and the bus doesnt look like it was even there. 
These things were made like tanks. 
Anyway, just wanted to let everyone know how wll the bus faired out of it all. I sure was dreading coming out to it, but I lucked out. 
I hope everyone else who met the strom faired as well. 

BTW, Steve, how was your trip?
