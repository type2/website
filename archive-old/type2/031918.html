Hi all:

I've finally started to put my 2 Vanagon engines back together, so one of 
the first things I did was re-install the oil pressure relief valves.  In 
looking at the valves themselves, both of them showed wear in the top 
flat face, right near the middle.  Shining a light up the oil relief 
valve bore showed nothing that would cause this wear.  It looks like a 
simple &quot;hole&quot; that gets plugged by the relief valve.

So...

  1)What's the source of the wear I'm seeing right in
    the middle of the valves' faces?

  2)Any consequences to re-using these valves?

TIA.
