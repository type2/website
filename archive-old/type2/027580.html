Just a note...The rekeying information for do-it-yourself rekeying is 
basically correct, but one cautionary note.  If you leave wafers out, make 
certain that the spring is not left in the empty chamber.  The spring can 
come partially loose and jam the lock.  When we rekey them, we use correct 
wafers in all chambers.  As the number of wafers left out of the lock 
increases, the security of the lock decreases.  Feel free to email if you 
need further explanation.
