&gt; Got some brake cables for my 69 from Bus Depot (211 609 701P,

&gt; should. Any suggestions? Rear brakes looked fairley meaty too.

Seth, have you adjusted the brake shoes? Your parking brake will most
likely never work good untill you adjust those. Then you can adjust
the parking brake cables.
