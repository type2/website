Subject: Re: [T2] Sealing a Hightop(converted)

hmmmmmmmmmmmm? i wonder where i can get that at and if it wraps around so it is in between the metal and fiberglass but also covers heads of screws? i wil have to see if i can find a picture somewheres of a seal on another hightop?
   
   
   
  someone had mentioned something to me long time back when i first pondered around about the hightop. something i could buy at lowes or home depot but i cant think of it for nothing...
   
   
  thanks

  whats the best way to seal a hightop where the self tapping screws were used? 


The hightops I've seen used a sheet of rubber between the aluminum strip and the fiberglass. That seals quite nicely. At least for a few years until the rubber decays.
