Subject: Re:fwd: Just-auto: VW to build Microbus at Hanover 

Hi Folks,

The article says the new bus will have &quot;high functionality with the comfort
of a limousine&quot;.
Now don't get me wrong, I like creature comforts as much as the next guy but
the reason we like our '71 is the simplicity and practicality.  This new bus
sounds more like a luxury car with a price to match.
