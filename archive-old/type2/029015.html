After reading all the messages on this subject following my original post,
and after reviewing again the Type2 archive, and considering my experience
of yesterday, I have these final comments.

1) 	Use the cord trick

2)	Use a decent amount of lubricant -- silicone spray is suggested, as is KY
Jelly, as is soapy water.  My error was not using enough lube, which meant I
had to whack and tug more than I would have if more lube was used.  But
getting the window fully set is tough, no matter what, and I do recommend
using a hammer on a board wrapped in a towel to drive the rubber down
against the metal for a good seal (the push is parallel to the glass).

3)	There is a debate regarding sealant.  I don't like the idea of black goo
between the rubber and metal.  Window Install Shops use the stuff, but this
is probably something used in other types of windows, and may not be
appropriate to VW seals.  I believe the better suggestions, (from more
informed authors I believe such as Mark Dearing) is to inject sealant under
the outside lip once its in place.  Some suggest silicone, Mark suggests
using 3M  #08633  sealant with a needle gun.  I've seen references to the 3M
adhesive as a quick fix for old seals, so this is probably the right stuff
to use.

Thanks to everyone who has shared experience, wisdom and opinion on this
topic.  I'm done on the subject, and look forward to finding some 3M  #08633
sealant and a &quot;needle gun&quot;.

&lt;&lt; Is this sealing compound something that is readily available, or is it
 something sold to the trade?
 What's this stuff called, by product name, if anyone knows.

Hello again Bob  &amp; list   I have found the best way to install the
windshield
in a bus is to use masonary cord , silcone spray, start at the top , finish
at bottom.   I don't like hitting the seal, but push only on the seal not
the
glass. After installing use 3M  #08633  sealant with the needle gun to seal
under the seal   .   Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem Va.
