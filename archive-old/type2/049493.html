Hey Everyone,
     Just curious if there is any interest in an informal VW bus club, both 
on/off net, with occasional meetings (like we did last winter at Friday's in 
Leesburg, VA). If so, please visit &lt;A 
HREF=&quot;http://clubs.yahoo_dot_com/clubs/midatlanticwestys&quot;&gt;Yahoo! Clubs 
midatlanticwestys&lt;/A&gt; . Thought it might be a good place to post messages 
specific to the region, like camping plans, VW shops, etc. If there is little 
or no interest I'll kill it. Thanks, Jeff S.
