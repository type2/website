&gt;plan on running it throu the cig liter plug while driving and running it off
&gt;ground power at night while camping. This will be off the main starting
&gt;battery. Anyone have any comments on how this'll work or similar experience
&gt;with Koolatron coolers.

If you're going to have shore power it might be OK. If you're doing any 
serious camping or ever considering an overnight stay without shore power 
you're money is better spent on ice. Here's my comments from sometime 
back:

I think the general list consensus has been it's only worthwhile in 
specialized situations-namely easy external powersources when stopped and 
relatively cool ( &gt;90F) ambient tempratures.
