Subject: More info about Voltage regulator

A little more info in regards to my Voltage regulator Question. I am going
to install my motor from my 74 Beetle into my 70 Bus. I am just about ready
to do the install but I was checking the wires in the engine bays and
comparing them. That's when I noticed the wires on the Beetle's Altenator
but not on the Bus. Thanks to T2's Library, I downloaded a wiring diagram
and noticed the VR and my lack thereof. Now I have 3 questions:

1. Where is the VR located / mounted on the 1970 Bus?
2. Can I use the VR from my Beetle?
3. Does anyone have a picture of a 70 model's VR  mounted?

Later,
