Subject: Re: [T2] vredenstien tyres

I am well aware of the difference in the profile between the two sizes.  
I am also aware of the 6 tenths of an inch smaller diameter from VW alt 
selection tire of 195/75 R14.  This will cause my speedo to read  
slightly higher.  Will have no effect (other than vastly improved 
handling) on anything else.  Bad purchase???  no way!  As stated on VW 
and tire manufacturer  info sheets on obtaining tires for older 
vehicles..tradeoffs will have to be made.

&gt; Here we go AGAIN!!   185/75R14 are the WRONG size. The correct tire

&gt; NOT have an aspect number in the middle.

&gt; This is my last reply to ANY tire post/question. They come up every 
&gt; other week
&gt; and the same questions are asked and the same answers are given. Does 
&gt; everyone
&gt; have totally selective reading habits????
&gt; As far as I am concerned, if the tire is round and holds air: Use it, 
&gt; you are
&gt; going to anyway. You guys buy 1st and then ask questions and then try to
&gt; rational your bad purchase.
&gt; Knowledge is power.  ASK FIRST.
