&gt;        My question is: what clutch plate do i need, seems there are 3 sizes

&gt;handy)). Is there a peticular brand i should look for? The throw-out bearing
&gt;is in good shape (still attached to fork, liitle pins still excellent shape)
&gt;should it be replaced?

I just sold an AW engine from a '74 bus - it had the 210mm clutch.
Sometime during the '74 model year they switched to the 215mm clutch set.
So, depending on whether your '74 is early or late, you might have either
the 210 or 215mm clutch.  You'll have to diagnose as well as possible from
the old parts.  Type 4 busses from 72 and on never had the 200mm clutches.

Others will disagree but I say that if your old throwout bearing is good,
keep using it rather than take a chance on a rebuilt one.
