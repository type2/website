Subject: Re: What's in a name

The name for my bus, Clementine II (a close runner-up was &quot;the Great Punkin&quot;),
came from owning a &quot;Clementine orange&quot; 70 squareback whilst I was stationed in
Germany in the '70's.  The bus has less red in its orange, but what the hey,
it's close enough to keep the name :)
