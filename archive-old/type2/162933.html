Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Ambiguous description (was: read side marker light
  source?)

	From my position 'off to one side'  -  I've had nothing to do 
with Ron's firm, nor do I particularly expect to  -  I would like to 
honour his scrupulous politeness &amp; helpfulness.  He could easily, and 
so far as I can see justly, have been more righteously defensive 
about the 'bulk ambiguities' accusation.
	Youse yanks would appear to be very well served by this 
careful man.  I only wish we had such a firm down under.

&gt;Constructive criticism is always appreciated, Mark.


&gt;  out of those 200,000 or so parts on my site,
&gt;roughly 5% of those represent about 95% of my sales.  I offer the other 95%
&gt;of them (often at little or even no profit) so that we can be a one-stop
&gt;source for your Volkswagen parts (of all years), which I feel is important.
&gt;Basically, the odds are that if the part is still made, it is on
&gt;BusDepot_dot_com.


&gt;
&gt;Any and all input, suggestions, and criticisms are gratefully appreciated.
