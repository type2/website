I have an 81 Westy-Cailf Model, 2.0, F.I.,  which has a super restictive
looking exhaust. (See your manual for an amusing ehaust path) Since I'm
not in CA,  I'd like to ditch the &quot;left&quot; side of this exhaust to add a
non-CA heater box (nixing the cat) which apparently will allow me to run
a free-flow cross over style muffler from Rocky Mtn Motorworks
(P/N#938-733 See tech tip in ehaust section of their catalog)

My problem is the O-2 sensor that is on the CA models.  There just
doesn't appear that there is enough room in the heater box to drill, tap,
weld (etc) to relocate the O-2 sensor.  Any thoughts on this? (mount in
muffler pipe?)  Appreciate any advice on  what is good exhaust set-up for
the air cooled Vanagon.
