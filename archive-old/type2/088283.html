Subject: Oil Dummy light acting up

Fellow listees

I have problem I need some help with, my oil dummy light is doing some =
wacko things.

Of coarse when I start the Van up the oil light comes for just a second =
and while I sit there everything is fine. When I back out of the drive, =
everything is fine, when I put my brakes on, my oil light lights up =
until I stop for a second. If I drive real fast and have to apply the =
brakes real hard the oil light comes on. If I am sitting on a hill with =
the bus' rear end up in the ait the oil light comes on. This is with =
full oil showing on the dipstick in a 1700cc engine, Weber Progressive =
carbed. I think its just a sender, what do you guys think?
