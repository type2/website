&gt;A friend of mine tells me that there are two different

&gt;He said the tooth count is the difference.  Is he correct?

Not even close.  There are three different sizes of type 4 flywheels.  The 
smaller two have the same tooth count.  There is no such thing as a &quot;6 
volt&quot; type 4 flywheel AFAIK.

&gt;Which Type 4 engine flywheel would work with the Type 1
&gt;engine starter?

Don't know, but if any of them would work I would suspect it would be the 
smallest, which is the 210mm flywheel used on the 72-74 type 4 powered US 
spec bus.
