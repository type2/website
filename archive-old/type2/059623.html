Hey all,

        My company is flying me out to Columbus to do some boring crap for
them for most of next week.  I am prolly going to be stuffed up in some
lame hotel room twiddling my thumbs.  If anyone is in that area, throw me a
number I can give you a call at so we can meet up and do a couple beers or
something.  I get &quot;bus sick&quot; pretty easy......dont you?
