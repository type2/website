Subject: RE: Removing Type 4 engine, limited head room

Hi All,

My 75 has a removable apron, non standard of course but a necessity with the
V8 engine I run in it.  It's great, I can prop the engine on a trolley jack,
remove the apron remove the engine crossmember bolts from the chassis,
leaving the engine connected to the crossmember and then after unbolting the
engine from the transaxle I can just slide it out the back of the bus, no
lowering the engine, no raising the Bus etc.  Comes in real handy when you
want to replace the clutch, just slide the engine back 2 feet and remove the
clutch, replace and slide the engine back in, almost no hassle with lining
it up and reduces engine pull time to almost minutes when the usual water
cooled bits and pieces are pulled.

I don't think weight was an issue eithier, I'm puting ot heaps of torque
from my motor and even though it's alloy it's still weighty.  I found the
first parts to get stressed and break were the standard engine crossmember.
I've since braced it and see know signs of wear and tear on the rear of the
Bus.

Cheers
Steve

Conventional wisdom is that the apron became non-removable in 1972 when
VW went to the Type IV engine because of the extra weight. I don't think
that's right. I think the issue is the crush zone. The metal around the
bumper brackets is quite crushable (ask Peregrine and me how we know).
and the necessary reinforcement for a removable apron would interfere
with that. At this point, I'd as soon use up someone else's crush zone
and make it easy to pull the engine.
