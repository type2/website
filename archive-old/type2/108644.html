Subject: fan shroud flaps

While replacing my heat exchangers yesterday I noticed that the flaps on the
fan shroud are missing on mine. I know I've read about these flaps but can't
remember exactly what they are for. Something about the airflow while the
booster fan is off or something like that right? My question is, are these
flaps a critical part of the cooling for my motor? Should I pull my exhaust
again and replace them? I really dont want to if I dont have to. It was a real
PITA to get everything lined back up and bolted.

Thanks
