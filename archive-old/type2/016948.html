Subject: new oil leak, 82 westi

The Westi has been marking it's spot for about a year now, but not
enough to worry about, but after a 60 mile trip yesterday, I noticed
numerous oil spots on the rear hatch for the first time. When looking
for the new leak this morning, I found very slow bubbling (air and oil)
from the base of #2 cylinder (between the cylinder and the case) while
the engine was running. I assume the air bubbles are coming from the
pressure in the crankcase. Any suggestions to stop this leak? Ideas I
have come up with include:

1.	Lowering the crankcase pressure 
2.	Torquing the head

The odometer shows 112k, but I don't have any engine maintenance history
from before my purchase at 94k.

TIA

Bill
