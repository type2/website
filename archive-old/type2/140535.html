Subject: Re: [T2] Seattle bus owners

&gt; I just brought my bus down from Vancouver. I need any and all information
&gt; and pointers on insurance, body shops, mechanics, registering a foreign 
&gt; bus,
&gt; emission requirements and parts stores. Basically, I know nothing. The
&gt; on-line insurange quote I tried to get did not even recognize the 
&gt; existance
&gt; of pre-81 vehicles not westfalias. I own a 78 Westy.

My insurance for my 78 westy is through my state farm agent.  They had no 
problem with the vehicle.

For a mechanic I have been going to Louis Foreign Auto
7301 Roosevelt Way NE
Seattle, WA 98115
(206) 524-3366
He's a couple miles north of the university.

Since your bus is a 78 you no longer have to do emissions testing.

For parts I have worked with Ken at Bus Depot.  Ken used to be in Seattle 
but has since moved to the east side.  http://www.busdepot_dot_com/  For new or 
generic parts I go to Bow Wow.  Bow Wow recently closed their Seattle store; 
they only have their Lynnwood store now.
