Subject: pair of wiper arms 68

Hello to you all...

I'm looking for a pair of wiper arms for '68 bus....
I've already sent an e-amil to Ken Madson from Thebusco_dot_com and he doesn't
have it...
I'm still waiting for an answer from Chris at Bustedbus_dot_com...
However, can someone else from the list help me?
I will need pictures and shipping cost to Lisbon, Portugal via airmail....
i will make payment using paypal.

Thanks in advance.
Best regards from Portugal.

Joao
