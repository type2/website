Hi Don!

Gasoline is a very good preservative if the tissue is submerged. Many listees will attest to the organic matter that has survived in various gas tanks to wreak havoc, leaves and sticks and so forth. Once Joe Fournier came up with a dessicated mouse from a tank, I saw it, it was not in good condition but it was mostly intact. If it were me I would pull engine, pull the tank , hose it out with detergent and lots of water, chase it with isopropyl alcohol, re-install. Some people slosh with marbles or big gravel. I believe this will save time in the long run although it will deprive the mechanic of some income. =^ )

&gt;Apparently his bus was successfully vandalized last Halloween.  WE found
&gt;and removed an egg from the gas tank filler pipe, but it seems one or more
&gt;eggs made it into the tank.  Shortly after putting the bus back on the
&gt;road last month, the thing died.  The garage found a clogged filter.  Bus
&gt;was fine.  Four days later it died again.  Filter again.  MEchanic thinks
&gt;we are seeing the result of a successfully egging.
