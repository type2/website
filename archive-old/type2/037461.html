Subject: junk yards

So, it looks like I am making a trip from Baltimore Maryland to Chicago this 
weekend to pick up a car for my brother. Not that I mind, he was nice enough 
to share the ride from here to Texas in a weekend for a new engine for my 
bus. 
Anyway, thought that I may have a bit of time to poke around at any VW 
junkyards that may be close to the highway between here and there. As I 
really need a new passenger door for my Ghia, and who knows the God's may be 
smiling on me. 
Anyway, anyone know of any yards that are known to have VW content in them 
not far off the highways...here is my trip route. 

Maryland I-270 North
to 70 West
to I-76 West 
to I-80 West
to I-90 west
looks like the trip takes me through Pittsburgh, Pa to the Akron/Cleveland 
area on to Toledo, Ohio and into Chicago.

Thanks All,
Melissa
