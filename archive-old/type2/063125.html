Subject: Waving

My experiance has showed me that most aircooled VWs (they are very rare
here in NY) wave to fellow Air Cooled drivers.  Sometimes I get carried 
away and wave to busses when I'm in my old &quot;Olds&quot;.  Never seem to get
a response.  Teenagers love busses.  The first night I got mine back on the
road a teenager asked if I wanted to sell it.  
Waving is very important to motorcyclists.  When I am driving my Yamaha I
get waves from most other Japanese bike riders.  No Harley rider wave
to me though.  Even if you make it so blatant, there is no way they could
not see you, they just drive by like they didn't notice.  Oh well when I 
eventually get my Harley, I will wave to everyone.
