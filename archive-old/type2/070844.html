I have looked throught the Bentleys and cannot find what the stock offset is
supposed to be.

I also need to know what is acceptable for custom wheels, what offset limits I
have to play with. I know Mercedes wheels will fit, but I am going to be
machining a custom set and I am going to first go with offsets as my base for
the choice.

Thanks 
Michael
