Subject: wandering idle


Hello Team VW,
I have another question, then i promise to shut up for a while. The 77 westy 
2.0 FI is finally back together and back in the car with new heads, clean 
heater boxes and a load of new seals and gaskets. It was properly timed and 
tuned by a decent mechanic and ran really well for a week (about 15 gallons 
of petrol). Now, it is hovering at idle and cutting out on uphill surfaces. 
Last night it sputtered to a stop, and would not restart. This AM, i walked 
down to where it was parked, hopped in, and it started right up, albiet with 
a really fast idle. I made it the half mile home, and then started trippin'. 
So, i was thinking fuel filter, but why would it go up in idle at the start 
off? I was also thinking vacuum, but I couldn't find anything loose or worn.
Any guesses?
-Jeremy
