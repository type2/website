&gt;As was mentioned, you can adjust the output via the linkage, some are
&gt;threaded and some have a pin. If you have the pinned one you may need to
&gt; play around shims (washers) to adjust the output. This varies the stroke of
&gt; the accelerator pump.

I don't think I'm getting across to people. The maximum stroke is less than spec. There is no more adjustment.

&gt; A few things to note, I have found many blocked outlets and seen many of 
&gt;the
&gt; brass tubes into the throat damaged which limits output, so check that 
&gt;also.

OK.

&gt; The brass tubes also often fall out or leak where they press into the body
&gt; of the carb, so make sure they're firm and not leaking.

I checked that.

&gt; Next later carbs (~75 or so) had a bypass which opens ~14degC (from memory)
&gt; which reduces the output of the accel. pump. It looks like a brass bulb
&gt; poking out next to the float bowl drain plug.

I've seen that in Bentley. It's not a feature of the 72 PDSIT carbs.

&gt; As for float level???? The normal shim is ~1mm so removing it completely
&gt; should raise the level,

The stock shim was 0.5mm. Removing raises the level only slightly and doesn't allow the float valve to seal properly.

&gt;if not you can bend the brass tag the float hangs
&gt; from to further increase the level. Not sure why you say you can't??

Because the float hit the celing of the float chamber. It's as if the Bentley 12-14mm spec is incorrect.

&gt; Anyway, a few other points, I've never found one with a low float level
&gt; (unless there's other problems), so look a little further. Are you 
&gt;supplying
&gt; ~4psi fuel pressure to set level? (or raise a fuel line up high and fill it
&gt; like that).

I'm not using the pump. Bentley says you can fill it without.

&gt; Are there no blockages in delivery, sticky needle/seat etc?

Not that I've found.

&gt; I have also found the top carby gaskets vary in thickness which affects the
&gt; level also. Lastly I suppose you are measuring correctly? From top of alum
&gt; (not gasket) to fuel level with float still in and carb level?

Yes.

My first measurement was almost 19mm without the gaskets in between the body halves. Then I realized the mistake and measure it again at 17mm which was still too much.
