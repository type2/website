&gt; Hello to all in VW land....
&gt; I have replace my rear brake shoes, both rear brake cylinders,
&gt; one front caliper, and both sets of front pads. My question is
&gt; what is the rear brake proportioning valve and do I need to adjust
&gt; it? Also, when bleeding the brakes I noticed that the calipers
&gt; have 2 bleeder screws, presumably one for each piston in the
&gt; caliper. Which do I bleed first? Are there any other adjustments
&gt; I am leaving out??? Thanks for resonponding........
&gt; 
&gt; And on the thread of doing your own work vs a mechanic, I like
&gt; doing my own work because then I know EXACTLY what was done.
&gt; If any corners were skipped, I know. If any parts were in quesion,
&gt; I know. I do not like letting others work on my cars because they
&gt; do not have the same vested interest (me and my family) as I 
&gt; do. Now for $3500, I would expect a heckuva engine!!!!! :-)
