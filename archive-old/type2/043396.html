Rob:
angled down, the engine will remove, and this angle makes
it hard to spline the clutch for an install. don't know what year
your bus is, but you might just as well pull the trans mount bolts
and disconnect the shifter, ease the teans / engine past the rear
apron and then pull it off...since the trans is coming out for rebuild...
