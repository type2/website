&gt;&gt; So, are the valves different for a FI system converted to a single carb,
or
&gt;&gt; is this just the case for an FI system converted to dual carbs? If there
&gt;&gt; were extensive modifications to the engine to  put this together, then i

&gt;the cam for the FI is different as well as the valves, and this causes 
&gt;problems, such as the engine running too lean at high speed. You can 
&gt;compensate for this with bigger jets in the carb, but then you run too rich

&gt;at low speed -- better than burning the valves out from running too lean,
but 
&gt;still not good, or economical. 
 
I gotta disagree with this.  The cam and valves are NOT different for FI vs
carb-ed engines (were talking type IV VW motors here).  The cam is different
for engines with hydraulic valves.  Valve sizes differ for the 1700, 1800,
and 2000 engines.  

But the part about rich/lean tradeoffs is true for all carburetors.  

A fuel injection system has sensors and a brain that decide how rich/lean to
make the mixture based on engine speed, throttle angle, temperature, etc. so
you always have an optimum mixture going to the engine.  

Carburetors, on the other hand, don't have ANY sensors and typically have an
idle circuit, a transition circuit of some type (ie. emulsion tube), and a
main circuit.  That means you can only adjust your mixture for 3 constants -
1000 RPM to around 1800 RPM uses only the idle circuit, around 1800 RPM to
around 2300 RPM uses a combination of idle and main mixed together with the
emulsion tube (or similar device), and anything above that speed uses the
mixture set by the main circuit.  This will cut into your overall
performance and economy.  If you set up a carb(s) for top-end power, your
bottom end and economy suffers.  If you set it up for economy, your power
suffers.  And there's damn-near no way to set it up to have optimum bottom
AND top end at the same time. 

Disclaimer:  These statements are based mostly on my experience with single
and dual Webers.  Other brands may have slightly different RPM ranges and
setups.  But the overall picture should be pretty much the same.
