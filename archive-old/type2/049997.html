&gt;&gt; I know it is winter and I know that I just posted a question regarding
&gt;&gt; heating, but I saw a post while in the archives about swampy coolers
&gt;&gt; http://www.swampy_dot_net. Has anyone used these? Are they good? Thinking of
&gt;&gt; bringing the van east this summer and even a guy who grew up in Jersey can't
&gt;&gt; bear to think of the humidity .... Any info is appreciated. Happy holidays
&gt;&gt; to all!!
&gt; 
&gt; sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but even if you do find a swamp cooler
&gt; it won't work where the humidity is high, it works by evaporation and that
&gt; requires a low ambient humidity, they work great in the Southwest.

The item I am talking about is actually a air conditioner that works with
ice:

How does the Icester work?
It works just like any other air conditioner except you do not have to vent
the heat outside. The
heat is transferred into cold water by drawing the heat through a Transfer
Core inside the Icester.
The Icester is capable of cooling so efficiently that it uses 20 pounds (9
kilograms) of ice per hour.
Keep the heat outside and enjoy the cooled air inside without drilling holes
or opening windows.
