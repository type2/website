&gt; You can do it!  The systems operating in a 70s era bus are about as simple
&gt; as it gets.
&gt; 
&gt; Mechanical ability is not the primary factor in choosing to own an old VW,
&gt; SANITY is.  You have to be a bit insane.  Slightly anal, compulsive, and
&gt; hugely utopian.  Your going to invest hundreds of hours of your time, your
&gt; sweat, your blood, and tons of mental energy, into this THING.  Just so you
&gt; can drive a slow, cumbersome, and quirky relic of a bygone era. 
Kevin:
HEY! They're not cumbersome, rather, I'd say NIMBLE, for a vehicle with
a net capacity of about a ton. Did you ever drive a big American truck?
(You'd not want one as your daily commuter vehicle!)
If yours is cumbersome, you don't have the tires and shocks right!
Other than that, I'd agree with what you said and maybe add STUBBORN!

69 double cab (nimble, but slow, except when compared to a splitty)
