I used to run a VOLVO with a 6V system. I ran an 8V battery! Found it at a 
farm supply house; they use them on tracters. The VR will put out enough to 
charge it.

&gt; &gt; Then I'd lean towards it being a lubrication/bearing problem.  That's
&gt; &gt; kind of suspect, though, since you've replaced the starter itself.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, since the old starter and the new starter exhibit exactly the
&gt; same failure mode. When I put the new starter in, I replaced the
&gt; bushing in the bellhousing with the correct 6V part as well.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Assuming the contacts inside the solenoid are in good shape (which
&gt; &gt; should be a reasonable assumption for a new/rebuilt starter), I'd say
&gt; &gt; the next question is what happens if you connect a plentiful supply of
&gt; &gt; six volts up, and try to crank it?  Unfortunately, such supplies
&gt; &gt; aren't exactly common these days....
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 10amp 6V battery charger that I hook up. It will generally
&gt; start with this connected, but unfortunately it still turns rather
&gt; slowly. Although, 10 amps is probably not enough to turn a 6V starter
&gt; fast if the battery is run down and not helping much. On the third
&gt; hand, the battery does pass a load test at the auto parts store. On
&gt; the fourth hand, maybe they don't know how to test 6V batteries
&gt; anymore?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Looks like I'm stuck.  Next?
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know of an autoparts chain or a store in the
&gt; Denver/Boulder/Longmont area that sells new 6V batteries?
