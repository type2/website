&gt;195/70R14
&gt;speedometer seems to be off by 10-15MPH at highway speed and 
&gt;closer to 5+MPH at low speed (neighborhood 25-30). considering 

OK, I'll agree that 195/70R14 is not the factory-correct tire size, but it's
damned close.  Close enough that replacing them with 195/75 or 185/75 is NOT
going to make the speedo read right.  For what it's worth, I ran 195/70R14's
on my 73 for 4 years of very aggressive driving and I loved them.  Sidewalls
were a little softer than recommended, but not nearly into the danger zone.

FYI, a 195/70R14 is 195 millimeters wide with a 117 millimeter (60 percent
of 195) high sidewall.  The 14 is the diameter of the rim it fits measured
in inches.  So the overall diameter of the tire in this case is about 24.74
inches (117mm x2 converted to inches + 14).  Here are some commons sizes and
their height/width in inches:
    185/70/14   24.20h x 7.28w
    185/75/14   24.92h x 7.28w
    195/70/14   24.74h x 7.67w
    195/75/14   25.50h x 7.67w
    205/70/14   25.29h x 8.07w
    205/75/14   26.10h x 8.07w

So you can see the height of the 195/70 is less than 1 percent smaller
diameter than a 195/75, but the speedo is reading about 20 percent high.  As
far as adjusting it, it can be done, but everyone I've ever talked to
recommends having a qualified shop do it.  In theory, you could pop the
speedo needle over the stop at 0 so there's no tension on it.  Then simply
pull it off and re-seat it a little further counter-clockwise (ie. if it's
point at, say, 5o'clock you could relocated to point to 4 o'clock) then slip
it back on the correct side of the stop.  I might try it with a spare
speedo, but would be hesitant to experiment on my one-and-only speedo.
