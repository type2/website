Hiya All,

First off, thanks to all who responded to my question concerning the bumps 
and bruises on my newly acquired 70 Bus.  As a Bus newbie I found that 
information invaluable.
Another question (2 actually) for the Almighty List.............  But first, 
my situation.  The muffler (possibly the entire exhaust system) sounds and 
acts like its shot.  For sure I'm getting post-ignition &quot;backfires&quot; on 
decompression (and acceleration) which would tend to indicate a fresh air 
leak into the exhaust system.  So, I'm thinking about replacing the muffler.
Question 1.  Can post-ignition backfires (in the muffler) cause the Bus to 
shudder or lurch while accelerating?  It sure seems as though this is what's 
happening to me courtesy an air leak.  Or is it more likely that I have 
distributor problems?  Everything else in the primary ignition system (from 
points to plugs and beyond) is new and accurately set.  By the way, the fuel 
pump and carb are also new.  Whaddyathink?
Question 2.  Is there any reason I cannot put a Bug muffler on my Bus?  I've 
been told that I could do this.  But now I'm wondering why the Bus has just 
the single exhaust as opposed to the Bug's two?  Why is that?  Am I headed 
for trouble by using a Bug muffler?  Opinions?
Thanks!

Mike
