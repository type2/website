&lt;&lt;  &quot;komfort bars&quot; for split and bay
busses and i was quite impressed by his work.  they come powder coated
black unless you request them not to be and they provide a good measure of
safety for you along with making the cab more rigid.  &gt;&gt;

I'd be &quot;real&quot; careful about adding or subtracting anything to the structure
of an existing vehicle that wasn't tested and spec'ed by an outside source.
Since I haven't seen or know anything about &quot;komfort bars&quot;, this may not
apply to them...Lotsa 'stuff' seems to logically offer more safety, but may
not when actually tested. Ridgidity might be one of them...Too much stiff-
ness 'might' induce forces that the seatbelts or even the seat mounts 
weren't designed to withstand...It's not the primary impact that gets you;
it's the secondary... ;-(
