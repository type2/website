&gt; At what temperature does oil really start lubricating properly? Let's say a
&gt; 20-50, perhaps a Castrol GTX brand.

Proper lubrication involves maintaining an oil film between the moving
surfaces of the engine, which isn't all that hard.  As long as the oil
flows properly and doesn't break down from heat it will work
satisfactorily.  You have to have a high enough temperature to evaporate
the water component of blow-by gases but low enough to prevent chemical
change to the oil.  180F-240F seems to be the safe range, with the low end
being preferable.

Oil at lower temperatures lubricates OK, but the actual parts of the
engine won't be operating at their optimum clearances.  For example,
pistons expand more than cylinders with heat, so if you run the engine too
cold, the pistons will have too much clearance.  This can result in more
rapid wear even with good lubrication.
