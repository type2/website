&amp;gt; Billy, don't complain too much as the last order I got was finally
&amp;gt; packaged quite well...but of course it had a couple of H4's in it
&amp;gt; as wll as some really heavy stuff.

Reminds me of a time , back in the heydey of JC Whitney, when I made the
mistake of ordering a set of H4 bulbs at the same time as an alternator.
They arrived packed in a battered cardboard box, with _one_ sheet of
newspaper as padding.  Miraculously, one of the bulbs actually managed to
survive the trip.  The other three were powdered glass.
