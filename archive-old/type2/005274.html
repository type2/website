I have a z-bed, rear facing seat &amp; sink unit out of a '70 westfalia FREE to
the first person to pick them up from my house Just south of Portland, OR.
But before you get too excited, they have issues!  The z-bed needs new foam
&amp; upholstry, (looks like a smokers accident!), &amp; no handle on the under-seat
storage door. The hardware &amp; wood are in good shape though. The sink is
missing the storage compartment handle and pump.  The drain tube has been
broken off, although I still have it.  The rear facing seat is OK, the
upholstry might be able to be cleaned up, possibly replaced.

I hate to just throw this stuff in a landfill, when someone else might be
able to make some of it work, or scavange something usable out of this!  If
no one wants it by this weekend its probably off to the dump!
