Subject: Rear brakes are done...

Howdy folks,     Quite some time ago I asked a question about how to get
my rear brake drum off the hub.  Just wanted to look behind it.  It
seemed to be locked or fused on.  I got a few responses and it came off
fine.  I wanted to get in and inspect my rear brake shoes and everything
else in there, to ready the bus for summertime driving.  Well I guess I
must have been fascinated with what I found.  Over the course of a month
or two I managed to get quite a bit done back there.  I'm no speedster,
and I was in no hurry so...  I took the drums, shoes, wheel cylinders,
brake backing plates, axles, and CV joints off or apart and proceeded to
clean, replace, sandblast and paint, and generally make the scene a whole
lot better.  Got in and did my wheel bearings too.  I painted up the tin
and heat exchangers then degreased the bottom of the engine.  Lastly I
had a couple holes in my crosspipe welded up by a muffler shop.  The guys
comment:  &quot; oh, new engine huh?&quot;   That made it all worth it.  
         So, I just wanted to thank all those that made their expertise
available concerning brakes, CVs, crosspipe, sandblasting, and all the
other questions I posed where listees came to my rescue.   Thanks!   I'm
out on the road now...
