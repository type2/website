Subject: Re: [T2] Coleman Catalytic heaters for in the bus

[...]

I queried Coleman about their claim that these heaters are OK in enclosed
spaces.  Their e-mail reply said they recommended an opening of at least 6
sq. in. for ventilation.  That's a hole only 2&quot;X3&quot;, and I'd personally be
pretty leery about sleeping with one of these heaters going and only that
tiny bit of ventilation.  They are sending me some documentation and a copy
of the operating manual, but I don't have it yet.

The trade association for these devices still says a flat &quot;NO&quot; to using any
catalytic heater in an enclosed space, especially while sleeping.  I asked
Coleman about the contradiction and their response was the comment mentioned
above.

FYI, Coleman also makes a version of these heaters with a battery-powered
fan to aid in circulation.  I'm considering one of these for our camper, but
want to inspect one before making a purchase.

&gt;&gt;  Here is a link to the heaters that were discussed earlier in the week.
I just ordered one and will hope that it gets here by the end of the month
for our campout.  &lt;&lt;
