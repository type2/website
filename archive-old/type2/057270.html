Subject: Airflow meter going on '78 Westy?

Hi all,

First the good news: I finally passed CA smog test! Yay!

Now the bad news: The mechanic had a hard time adjusting the fuel mix. He 
says he'd get it about where he wanted it and then the CO would spike way 
up, indicating too rich a mix. He said he thinks the airflow meter in my 
'78 Westy fuel injection is pooping out. Bummer! 

I've got nearly 200,000 miles on the thing. I know those potentiometers 
in the airflow meter do poop out with age. Is this a reasonable symptom 
of this condition?

FLAPS says they can get me a new Bosch airflow meter for (gasp) $320. I 
haven't checked with Ron Salmon yet. I'd guess these things are 
rebuildable in principle. Anyone know what the market for new and rebuilt 
ones is like?

If this is indeed the problem, sounds like I'd better get a replacement 
ASAP so when the original fails I've got something to swap it with.

Anyone know if an '89 or later one would work on my '78? I know a few 
details of the FI changed (like adding an O2 sensor on the exhaust), but 
I don't know if this part changes or not.

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
