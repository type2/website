&gt; Folks,
&gt; Does anyone know any problems with using your standard 'crankcase
flush' crankcase cleaner on late bus engines?  I checked the archives,
but couldn't find a response.
&gt; Sorry for waste of bandwidth for such simple question.
&gt; Thanx for any response.

IMO, such cleaners are to be avoided.  If you have been using
detergent oil (and there's darned little non-detergent oil out there
nowadays) your crankcase should be quite clean.  An engine flush will
have little effect.

OTOH, if you have a truly gunked up crankcase (due to neglect,
non-detergent oil, etc), then you really should do a teardown to clean
the case.  If you loosen a large amount of sludge in the system, you
risk clogging passages and the oil filter.  This will open the bypass
(if there is one) allowing grunge direct access to your bearings. 
There is also the risk of _not quite_ removing all the sludge, leaving
quantities to break loose later on to clog the filter, etc.
