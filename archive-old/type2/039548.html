Subject: Re: Fuel Injection to Carbs?

I switched from fuel injection to a single weber progressive a few years 
back, and have had no trouble with it. I am, however, having a little trouble 
adjusting to the 009 dist. that I installed, with a pertronix ignition 
module;  the hesitation and flat spot are a PITA.
