&gt;Anyhoo, it's stock and it pings on regular.

Another thing to consider is the compression of the engine that's in
the bus.  It was probably suitable for 91RON gas when it was new, but
it can be changed quite a bit in the process of rebuilding the engine.
 Unless the builder is quite careful to keep the compression ratio
low, you can end up with an engine that pings on regular unleaded.
