Subject: Mystery part
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Hello  
I'm hoping the some of the list members can give me a helping hand 
identifying a mystery part we cant identify.
Me and my buddy are rebuilding his sons engine and after we split 
the case we found two metal dowels on the ground next to the workbench.
We both have thumbed through the Wilson book on
rebuilding VW engines looking for the mystery part but are lost.
It is not a main bearing dowel, its a little smaller
and longer. 

I put a picture up, to help aid in judging the size.

After the page loads just click the picture to enlarge it.

Engine: 79' 2L engine

Could someone help us out and tell us what this might be.

Thank you,
Steve Wilson
