Subject: Re: Camping stool trash can

For those needing a trash can liner to their Westy stool/trashbox, take
an ordinary 5 gallon wallboard spackle bucket and grind the top edge at
90 degree corners until it slips into your box perfectly!  You may have
to cut a bit off the top also.  I used sash cord as a handle to pull it
out.  4 gallon buckets fit nicely into this as removable trash inserts.
