&gt;hello again volks!
&gt;
&gt;i'm about to install new rear shocks that i bought from motorworks.  and i 
&gt;have a quick question....
&gt;
&gt;the shocks on the bus now have coils over them (attached to the shock 
&gt;itself.)  

Missy:

It looks like the PO installed aftermarket coil-over shocks.  This may be an area of concern, namely, why did the PO use coil-overs?  Usually, coil-overs are used because the stock springs have gone soft (in any vehicle, not just VW's), or for higher-performance suspensions.  I'm hoping those coil-overs aren't hiding a torsion-bar problem that you'll discover when you take them off.
