&gt; Auto tranny is a regular auto tranny service:
&gt; Pull the pan, clean it, replace the filter, button it back up and fill with
&gt; ATF through the dipstick tube...
&gt; Messy job. Now i know why they got 80 rocks for it...

don't think it is very messy, pull the dip stick tube off the side and let
it drain. then take pan off and clean,  CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN conditions are
important.

there is still the final drive oil change, same as manual but you can use
GL-4/5
   personally I use all synthetics and not worry about the problem, one
little &quot;nit&quot; about synthetic AT fluid is that it smells burned right out
of the bottle so you can't use the &quot;burned&quot; smell to diagnois
