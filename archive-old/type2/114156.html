&lt;&lt; That have a certain tool that is sold at finer auto
body finish stores made to remove runs in hardened
paint. It has been a while since I saw one but it has
a small blade in it which you use to cut the run mark
down to the level of the rest of the paint. It works
like a miniture hand plane. You then water sand and
buff. If you have a bad run and start sanding without
removing most of the run first, it is easy to sand
right through the paint. I don't know if it is worth
the trouble to try and locate one at your local auto
paint store or not. Either way, good luck!

If you can't find it locally, the Eastwood Company
carries it.
