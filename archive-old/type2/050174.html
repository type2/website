Subject: [T2] a little friday advise needed

purchasing advise needed:

okay, i've spoken to the current owner of my soon to be in my possession 
bus....and i know there are a few items i need to purchase, and i would 
like some .02 on manuf/performance of there products....or recommendations.
first...it's a '76 Westy...orange, unnamed as of yet.

--pop-top canvas-everyone claims there's is the best. i don't want the 
original color, because everyone knows that orange or tan become an 
enormous light bulb in the morning. i would settle for something plain and 
dark.
--front door kick panels-i'm sure i can't get these in the orange color 
anymore, unless they are used...or can i?
--front door seals-these are why i need to replace the kick panels.
--sliding door seal
--pop top/luggage rack seal
--various door handles/wdw. handles
--heater/fan controls-mainly knobs, but my friend told me (these are his 
words), &quot;the PO 'ripped' out any controls to all the vents EXCEPT the 
defroster...which blows all day every day, with no way to turn it off.&quot; so, 
i am unsure as to what else this may entail.
--mosquito snap-in nets-once again everyone raves about their own

sorry this was kind of long, i'm just thinking of putting in various orders 
over the next week or so...and i just hate returning stuff...but i love 
getting an awesome product!!!

thanks in advance!
missy:)
