Subject: front exhaust and heat exchanger
Message-ID: &lt;380CAA28.82B6ED4A_at_uswest_dot_net&gt;

Dear Listees:

I am wanting to replace both front exhaust pipe and heat exchanger, left
and right, on my
'77 FI2.0 CamperVan and am wondering if there is a source for OEM, I
want the best product I can buy.
I would appreciate direction and guidance concerning the best source or
sources and any
other comments any of you'll might have.

Thanks a ton
Dennis Allen
