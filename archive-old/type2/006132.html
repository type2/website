&gt;Does anyone know if the front seats out of an 84 Vanagon will work in a 73
&gt;Transporter

Brian,

If you just want something to make your bus drivable, they would work with a
little modification.

I tried a Vanagon seats in my 79 camper.  They fit, but I didn't  like them
much so I put the stock seats back in.  The Vanagon seats have arm rests
which hit the arm rest that is mounted on the doors, so you have to take one
of them off.  Also, the Vanagon passenger seat wouldn't swivel 180 degrees
like my stock seat does (I don't think the passenger seat swivels on your
model bus).  And the Vanagon seat adjustment lever is on the side bottom of
the seat instead of the front bottom., interfering with the center box
between my seats.


Later,
