I did read T.E.K-A.A.T., bladder totems, lime-light neon dusk, and
all, but I was in the eighth grade at the time, and can't say I
remember it too well.  Correct me if I'm wrong: Kesey's bus was a
full-sized school bus, nicht wahr?

Just saw one o' them highly dayglo (VW) buses rolling down Rt. 1 past
my house yesterday, matter o' fact.  I was psyched.  It's rare to see
a VW bus period here in NJ, so spotting one in full dayglo is a
Definite Event (tm)!
