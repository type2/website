&gt; How come?  I've drilled tons of bolts out.  Start with a small bit and
&gt; get progressively bigger.  It's slow going, but it should be able to get
&gt; 'em out of the flange.

should I guess but I've run out of time, got one day left tommorrow and
only a few hours at that, I will use em as alignment studs and weld. won't
hurt em and maybe later I will grind the welds off and do it &quot;right&quot; but
just plain outta time gonna have to use the &quot;big sledge hammer&quot; and just
weld it together.  we had a brief warm spell here in the east but Fri it
is supposed to get VERY cold again and I have to work outside.  she gets
back on the road tommorrow if at all possible.

thanks anyway
Bob
