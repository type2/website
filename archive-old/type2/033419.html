Subject: New listee (kind of longish)

Hello all.
    I am relatively new to the list, never posting before, but following 
along on the threads.  I've already picked up on numerous helpful hints and 
observations.  
I am also new to owning a bay window bus.  A scant year ago  would have 
laughed at anyone that told me I'd own an automatic, fuel injected bay window 
bus.  I've owned (and own) several beetles, and a 56 single cab (gone) and a 
'63 double (still).  I'm afraid that I was caught up in that syndrome where 
all aircooleds after 1970, especially, busses, were  second rate at best.  I 
even pretty much skipped over the  (extremely rare) articles about them in 
the VW magazines.
    But here I am owner of a nice '78 Westfalia that has spent the last 9 
years languishing in an old man's garage.  A fuel pump and a tune up and it's 
great.  I've been driving it as much as possible and I told my wife that of 
all the VWs I've owned,  think that this one is going to be my favorite.  
(and unlike most of the others, she actually wanted me to get this one!)  
I've got a 4 year old and a 6 year old and they love it!  
    Anyway, to the purpose of this posting-why are the bay busses so lowly 
regarded by the rest of the VW enthusiasts?   Any ideas?  And does anyone 
think that this will change?  It is a shame that these busses and trucks are 
not very well accepted because they really are great vehicles.  It doesn't 
matter, really, because I'm going to pamper and enjoy mine regardless, but 
I'm curious to hear other's opinions.
