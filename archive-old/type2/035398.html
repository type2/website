Subject: Re: Subject: Source for 2L heads?

&gt;&gt;Hi there,
&gt;&gt;please contact Riechert Tuning for new 2.0 liter cylinder heads. Riechert
&gt;&gt;Tuning is the only source for new original VW 412 cylinder heads. They can
&gt;&gt;modify those heads any way you want. By the way, only the 039 cylinder head
&gt;&gt;drops valve seats.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Axel Fisser
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;BTW, what are 039 heads?  Must be all the ones they shipped to 
&gt;North America!

Without looking I'll guess 039's are square port heads, and the original
statement
is untrue.  The square port is a poorer design, and much more likely to
drop seats,
compounded by the fact it is usually (except for '79) in a heavy ass
Vanagon, but
all VW T4 heads will drop seats with a passion.  The early 1.7's had a
nasty tendency
to snap exhausts before you got to seat issues, but any will eat a seat,
oddly in my
limited experience (the 20+ cores I got in my basement) usually a #1 or #3
INTAKE
which makes little sense to me but is the case in that limited sample about
75% of
the time, about 20% dropped an exhaust, the other couple OK though often with
cracks running out of the exhausts.  The square port head is much more
likely to
crack in the exhaust as the section is much thinner, and all AMC heads seem
more
likely to east seats (though most AMC I've seen have been square port.)

As to replacement, after experience with ALL of the major type 4
rebuilders, I'm severely
tempted for any round port application to order the 1.7's from Reichert
new, have them
cut to appropriate barrel size and live with the small exhausts.  Anyone
impressed by
ANY of the major T4 rebuilders hasn't looked very closely,  hasn't put very
many miles
on their engine, or has been pretty darn lucky, though quality with most of
them seems
mostly hit and miss, you will either get under 10k or go between 75 and 100.
