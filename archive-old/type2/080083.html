I had a chance today to discover just how attached I have become to my =
74 Bus in the few short months that I have been 'daily-driving' her.

For the past couple of days I have been driving the company truck, an =
F-250 pickup. It has a fairly good ride, plenty of power, cruise =
control, scads of heat and/or air conditioning, and a really nice Alpine =
sound system. I've been zipping around town and made a few 100 mile =
round trip runs to our other plant, all in relative comfort and ease.

Then I got into my bus this afternoon to head home for the weekend. The =
sun was bright but the temps were in the low 50's with a cold wind =
biting out of the northwest. I climbed in and started her up, nursing =
the pedal until the engine smoothed out. I crackled up and down the =
radio dial, finally settling for a local pop station that would come in =
fairly clearly.  As I drove through town on my home home, catching every =
red light, I realized that I was more comfortable in my cold, drafty, =
underpowered bus than  I ever had been while driving the truck. Or any =
other vehicle I've ever owned.

I can't be alone in this, can I? I know I can't be since all of you are =
on this list with me. What is it about these vehicles that gives them =
such power over us? By modern standards they fall short in nearly ever =
catagory, yet we choose them over all others.  Why? I get asked this =
question all the time but so far I haven't come up with an answer that =
satisfies me, or them.

I do know one thing. For me, it isn't so much the road less traveled, =
it's the vehicle less traveled in that holds the appeal.

Just rambling,
