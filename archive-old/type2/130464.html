Subject: Re: [T2] vehicle inspection on long island

Having crossed the country with a 245 hauling a u-haul trailer, I would 
not recommend this. No problems with getting the bus rolling and 
keeping it rolling in tow. All of the problems have to do with 
stopping. Hard to stop that much momentum. But if you do take this on, 
Scott is right. Tow the bus, not the Volvo. Avoid city traffic in rush 
hour. And practice braking a few times the first day, before pulling 
out, then every morning before departing. (Braking is a proficiency.)
