well from me you'll get a plain ole wave, but being a little slow you may
have to check in the rearview mirror to actually see it.

 the only sticker on my daily driver is my Veterans sticker in the rear
window.

oh well, never was a hippy and still can't surf, bus sure isn't showroom
clean  so I must be in that used and abused catagory

heck when I visited my father in a nursing home they wanted me to park
around back so I wouldn't make the place look &quot;Low class&quot; by parking out
front.
