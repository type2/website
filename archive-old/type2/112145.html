73 Westy...  
are stock rims painted? what color or were there different colors?
 
after stripping off 3 coats of Rust-Oleum, I am down to bare metal.  It seems the first coat was silver.  Is this the stock paint on the rims?
 
funny with the other chrome thread, I was gonna ask about chroming them.  I guess it may be better/cheaper to just stick with stock spray paint silver if that's the case.
