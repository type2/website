Subject: Re: [T2] cly. head gaskets

personally I use em if the engine already has em, and don't if the
engine doesn't already use em.

if building a new engine I would use em but not all heads have
sufficient cutting to allow the head to seal without em. AVP heads
need em. and reccomends them.

&gt;  In the next couple of weeks I am planning to drop my engine and cure some oil leaks. Bentleys says no
&gt; cylinder head gaskets are used but Bus Depot and others have them listed for sale. If I remove my heads do i
&gt; need cylinder head gaskets on hand or no?
