OK folks, this is technically against list rules since it contains no
specific type 2 content, but it is an issue that will hit type 2 owners if
it isn't stopped dead in its tracks.  I decided to go ahead and forward
it.

Forwarded message:

It has come to my attention that the Oregon State Legislature has it's
sights on vintage cars.  According to an article that I got from a parts
house, Oregon state rep. Richard Devlin has introduced a bill that would
prohibit the registration of ALL MOTOR VEHICLES MANUFACTURED BEFORE 1981
beginning Jan. 1, 2010.  The bill would allow the registration of antique
or special interest vehicles that HAVE PASSED UNSPECIFIED EMISSIONS
STANDARDS.

 If you want to register your opposition to this bill (HB 3217) you can
call the Oregon Legislative Assembly's information line at (503) 986-1187.
Or the sponsor Rep. Devlin _at_ &lt;devlin.rep_at_state.or_dot_us&gt;
 or other reps found _at_

 Thank you for your time.
