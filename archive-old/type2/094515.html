Subject: Re: [T2] Spray-in Bed Liners

The bed liner is another option that i used on one bug.  I bought one of 
the rubber truck bed liners from the flaps and cut it do what i needed.  
I think they run about 45 dollars.  This is a very heavy thick rubber.  
On the bug it made an exceptional sound deadner.  Note the heavy when 
you try to pick up a box for even a small midget truck.

&gt;&gt; 1.  blasts it bare.
&gt;&gt; 2.  puts down a binder layer/primer layer
&gt;&gt; 3.  applies rhino
&gt;&gt; 4.  extracts wallet
&gt;
&gt; The last part is the part that I have heard about. VERY expensive 
&gt; process!
&gt; Not that many people do it.. This is for pretty vain truck owners who 
&gt; can
&gt; afford it. Bed liners are cheaper and more practical. If you're just
&gt; intending to cover this up, maybe it's not for you.
&gt; I think that white synthetic rubber is called, &quot;Snow Roof&quot; or something 
&gt; like
&gt; that. It's good! Jan B
