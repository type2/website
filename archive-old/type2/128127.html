Subject: Re: [T2] want to camp sat, please help!!

he wouldnt be running if it sucked a valve or messed up the piston i have been through that and the engine will not turn over in such a case..
daniel what about the points? the points can cause popping crackling .
or it could very well be from the smallest of small exhaust leak...?small hole somewheres?
are you sure you got the dizzy in there right and all the way down..?
i will look in the morning and see if i can find my notebook on tuning your carb.. i am sure that my wife has the same one on her beetle but its been a while since it was tweeked so i will have to look over my notes,,.
have you checked the valves?
what about compression..
sorry i am not one to give advice and surely am not a mechanic but do wish that i could help you cause if anyone i understand your frustration..
start trouble shooting though...
and get some rest start fresh in the morn.. i know you want to go camping but you also want to still get love from your bus..and not tear something up..? timing is very very important as well as carb settings... remember wrong mixture can be a do or die situation...
if you are talking about picasso we wont be leaving to go until around 4 :30ishpm saturday...
 
yes there is a 2 1/2 turn on that carb i believe from close... but i actually am thinking there is three adjustments for that carb..? 
like i said though i will look in the morn first thing at my notebook if anyone can help daniel please do..
 
 i wouldnt say that smoke is normal... what color is the smoke..? white is lean black is rich i am thinking..? rather rich than lean is best though in any case...
also you set it at TDC but you never did say if you set it at 10dbtdc? did you leave it at TDC and go from there..? i am also thinking that you should be setting it up at 10DBTDC?
someone correct me if wrong for daniels benefit..and of course my own LOL..
peace bro
chris

Listees,

('71 1600 DP, 009 dizzy running points)

I've been spending lots of time and money trying to get my bus running 
&quot;good&quot;. After the rebuilt carb proved to be beyond help, I got a new 34 PICT 
carb (the Latino variety) from my FLAPS today and insalled it. I also had to 
replace the dizzy clamp as mine was shot.

So I took set to TDC and removed dizzy and repalced clamp and carb and got 
it all back together and I got it running but it's running poorly. The good 
news is that it idles great at 800. But I'm just frustrated with the whole 
timing thing. First my timing gun is like an older kind that connects 
between #1 plug and #1 plug wire, seems everyone else has one that just 
clamp on the wire. The timing just seems inconsitant like it's missing at 
idle but does seem consistant while rev'ing. I was having severe pinging for 
while, this like popping/crackling sound and it seems to come more from the 
passenger side of the engine, but I got it timed to my 30 degrees total 
advance mark (per article in library) while reving to 3000 + RPM.

I took for test drive and it pops/pings when I rev up for awhile and coast. 
Also I think something simple is just screwed up and it seems I'm only 
running on three cylinders or something. It just didn't have the power it 
once did. After my test drive I tested the dipstick and it seems hotter than 
it should. It was also smoking a bit but I guess that's normal for a VW 
engine eh?

Does carb adjustment affect popping/pinging/backfiring/running hot? And are 
there three adjustment screws or only two, I only know of the two on the 
left side, biggie and little, the little I understand is the mix adjustment 
and the big I understand is the idle adjustment. I did the 2 1/2 turn trick 
and probably need to adjust the mixture per the Bentley procedure as I 
couldn't really do it that way with my old carb cause my idle wasn't really 
consistant (it's ALOT better now with new carb).

If anyone could help talk me through this tune up mess that I'm in I would 
appreciate it, I could call you - man I would appreciate it.

Thanks,

Daniel
