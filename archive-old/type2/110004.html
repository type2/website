&lt;&lt;  and a heat shield that goes above
the exhaust (VW 070-119-227A)  for an 82 Air-cooled Vanagon. The parts
can have surface rust, but no holes or major rust.

You can see images of these parts at

The heat shield looks like something a sheet metal shop (custom ducting
for HVAC systems) could knock out for you. You might even be able to
DIY, if you have the pattern...I'd guess the original probably used asbes-
tos, but the plumbing supply house carries fire-proof mats for sweating
copper in tight spots that you could sandwich between the sheet metal...
