Actually, one of the engines saved using this &quot;filter&quot; was in the vehicle
my wife drove 100 miles round trip, across parts of 3 heavily &quot;ashed&quot;
counties, 5 days/week.

She was traveling mostly on Interstate 5.  That corridor was particularly
troublesome because it was lined with piles of volcanic ash that had been
plowed/swept from the roadway.  The wind from the constant traffic kept
huge quantities of the ash stirred up and airborne, sometimes reducing
visibility to near zero, and these conditions prevailed for many months.

The St. Helens ash was mostly silica, and the ash from each of the many
eruptions had unique chemistry and form.  Some was highly acidic, and the
particle sizes ranged from talcum powder fine to as much as 1/4&quot; in
diameter with a jagged and sharp surface.     

Protecting carburetor and fuel injection air intakes was a relatively
simple issue - this stuff was also death on wheel bearings, CV joints,
brake linings and drums/disks.  It even got into hydraulic systems and
wreaked havoc with master and brake and slave cylinders.  Transmissions
weren't immune, either, although conventional differentials fared quite
well.

There are still abandoned vehicles, including construction machinery and
farm equipment, to be found around the Northwest that were turned into
scrap by the ash.  

Just try and imagine the effects of this stuff on an air-cooled VW
Transporter!!!  [OBC}

&gt;&gt;Back in the early '80s, when Mt. St. Helens turned Washington and the
&gt;&gt;Northwest into an incredible dustbowl/sandblast box, the airborne 
&gt;dust
&gt;&gt;and grit was killing engines in minutes.  No typo or hyperbole, 
&gt;&quot;minutes&quot;

&gt; Good post Fred, even if some of our brethen are calling it a 
&gt;story you told your wife . . :-)
&gt;
&gt; A nylon stocking obviously can be stretched or not for a different
&gt;degree of air flow . . oiled , it would stop even more . .
&gt;
&gt; Can be used as a temp fan belt . . a temp cover for a bad CV Boot.
&gt;
&gt; In our recent Gulf War, wives were being asked to send pantyhose
&gt;to our troopies in the Dirt . . . they make an excellent &quot;gun sock&quot;
&gt; . . you can even shoot thru them . . keeps the grit out of the
&gt;action . . for all I know they were using them on their vehicles too.
&gt;
&gt; It wouldn't hurt to have a pair in the emergency kit . .
