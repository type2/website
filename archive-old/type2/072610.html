Subject: downshift strategy
Message-Id: &lt;v01510104b34ebe423532_at_[207.172.65.2]&gt;

I own 3 acs and have trouble downshifting into second on all three.  I've
read here on the list that one should rev the engine to facilitate this
downshift.  My question involves the target rpm for such a rev. Is one
trying to match some rpm exactly?  Or is it enough to get the rpm above
some value?

thanks, Jack
