Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Vents?

Well,  I don't mind the kind of PITA that you mention near as much as
the PITA of taking the fuel tank out (again (for the 4th time)).  I
forgot all about that big round cover!  I had been a bit nervous about
taking the ECU out but, I'm not too worried about that anymore.

Thanks,

&gt; I was really hoping that somebody with a really great
&gt; method would write as it is really a PITA for someone
&gt; with fat - ahem - muscular arms...
&gt;
&gt; It's been years since I've done it, but lessee if I
&gt; can remember. Pop that big round cover off the right
&gt; side of the engine compartment and remove the FI ECU.
