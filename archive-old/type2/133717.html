Subject: RE: [T2] Why I drive a VW bus...

I resemble some of those remarks and agree with &quot;lighten up, it is humorus&quot;. 
Some people believe that they are so &quot;aware&quot; of what is not right that they 
have become &quot;the Unconscious&quot;. Didn't we all learn on the play ground that a 
See-Saw/Teeter-Totter that one sided games are no fun.


Down the Middle....nobody is perfect,

Michael Knight
