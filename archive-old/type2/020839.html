&gt; &gt;Hi folks,

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; The first site, hitch-web_dot_com, only shows a hitch down to '73, '72 and
&gt; earlier they claim to have nothing and invite you to call for a custom
&gt; solution. But, since '72 was the first of the type4s, that verdict is
&gt; suspect.

Paul:
Bays would have 3 different types: 68-71, 72, and 73-79. I'm pretty sure that
Valley still makes class 1's for 68-71's, because my neighbors are a boat store
and they had a listing ( a couple years ago, anyhow, I was going to put one on my
69 double cab). I'll check it out in the next few days.
I had one on my 78  back in the 80's (Valley, class 1) and it worked fine.  I tow
barred a couple of cars with it (tow bars have essentially no tounge weight),
including the 69 double cab 2/3 of the way across Iowa one happy nite in 1986!
I'd been trying to buy it for 4 years previous and the current owner called me up
and said $700, TODAY!
Didn't take me long to decide!
Al Brase
