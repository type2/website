Subject: Re: [T2] Re:liquid repair for loose ball joints?

Hello Mike   We living in 1973 now are we?? I said it the first time I'll say 
it again Are you Nuts, no I didn't say MUTTS either. If the damn thing is 
worn replace it the right way and quit looking for the cheap way. You are going 
to get yourself killed or worse me or your own daughter or Chris but I dought 
that that ball jt will make it to Tennessee. Be careful out there man.  Later 
and have fun  Mark Dearing
