&gt;You said:
&gt;&gt;Harbor freight has 4 x 3 trailer (2 wheel kits) on sale right now for
&gt;$130.
&gt;&gt;I some time tow a 4 x 8 trailer (same manufacturer) with my bus  with no
&gt;&gt;problems.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;So, where do I find these fine people???
&gt;


If you live in Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon,
Colorado, Texas, Claifornia or Washington they have retail stores in most
larger cities.  If not they have a catalog-----1-800-423-2567.  Most of the
stuff is from China and I wouldn't buy anything that requires great
strength (chinese steel) (easy outs, stud pullers, etc) but they have most
everything in the way of tools and hardware at greatly discounted prices.
It's like a candy store for tool fanatics.

Have fun
