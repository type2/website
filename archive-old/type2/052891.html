Subject: Powder Coating my Rims

I've just bought a couple of old rims with a view to getting all my rims
powder coated in a 'rolling program' to avoid having my bus off the road.
To anyone who has done this before, do I need to have any parts of the rim
masked off before coating, or do you just coat the whole thing inside and
out?
When I'm done I will have a couple of spare rims - maybe I should start a
Rim Exchange Service.
