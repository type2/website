Subject: [T2] 75 Fuel Injection on a 78 Engine?

Thanks for the advice on my fuel injection. I have checked the part
numbers and the F.I. that came with the bus is definitely 1975 but I do
have all the parts for it. Karl and Steve are both right about the 78
wiring harness having more pins than the 75 for the AFM. It should run
fine with the complete 75 fuel injection, don't you think?

I spent today stripping the engine of all the sheet metal etc. I noticed
the difference in the pressure plate and fly wheel. Can I use the 78
flywheel or should I use the flywheel off the engine that came with the
engine? I assume the flywheel that came with the bus is a 1975 unit
because of the size of the clutch disk (215mm). Both the 75 and 78 units
are in good shape. Does either assembly have advantages over the other?
I hope to avoid problems with the starter gear engaging the flywheel.
Does the flywheel have any influence on crankshaft end play? I haven't
found anything to indicate that in any of my manuals but I'm hoping
someone with more experience knows for sure.

All help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks so much.

7000 ft. Knee deep in snow &amp; rebuilding a bus. Adventure? Insanity?
Actually most of the snow has melted but more is expected this week.
