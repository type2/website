&gt; Re the 75, which was dying under load so I had to drive in first......
&gt; Checked timing, advance, dwell, OK.

Have you checked the vacuum at idle?

&gt; Bus started ok and revved fine in
&gt; neutral, pressure went to 35, leveled off around 28-30.  Went up the
&gt; local steep hill, and he noticed it dropped to 17 psi under
&gt; load.....this is not good, right?  So we suspect a fuel delivery problem
&gt; (blockage or weak pump.)  Had no time to deal with it, and parked it
&gt; outside.  Next day, it would not start (cold, like 15 degr out)(turned
&gt; over ok, not a glimmer of it catching, not even with ether sprayed into
&gt; air intake.  Fuel pressure read 28 psi

If I understand correctly, fuel pressure never exceeds ~35psi with a working
pressure regulator.  At idle with the vacuum hose attached, fuel pressure
should be ~28psi if you don't have any vacuum leaks.

When you step on the gas, vacuum drops and fuel pressure should rise to near
35 psi.  As you increase rpms, vacuum will increase beyond the idle level
and the fuel pressure will reduce so I don't think seeing 17 psi is
unreasonable to witness when you are flooring it.  When you let off the gas,
the vacuum momentarily spikes and fuel pressure is reduced for a second.  It
makes sense to me that as the manifold vacuum increases the fuel pressure is
reduced because the injectors require a constant pressure at the tip.

I think it's incorrectly stated that the pressure is always constant. It
will be different, but still constant at any given rpm.

&gt; Had someone crank it as I
&gt; watched; seemed to be weak white spark compared to the strong one on our
&gt; 78.)  Jon told me not to spray into air intake, but yank the poly tube
&gt; from the intake manifold connection to brake booster and squirt in
&gt; there.  I also cranked it with a jump from another car, and it started.

Where did I read about the precautions for jump starting a FI bus? I can't
find any in the owner's manual but I know I read it somewhere.

&gt; In garage I checked the delivery by placing tube from pressure port into
&gt; a jar...did about 3/4 cup in 30 seconds, which according to Muir is too
&gt; low??

I wish Bentley had some info about this however the VW/Bosch L-Jet workshop
manual says:

Deflect the flap in the AFM and you should get 1.5-2L of fuel per minute.

&gt; Tomorrow I will drain the tank and check the fuel filter and
&gt; likely check line from tank, maybe blow air up the line and pull sender
&gt; &quot;replacement cover&quot; to check inside tank.

Sounds like the Bentley advice in the pressure regulator section.  I hope
you find the cause soon.
