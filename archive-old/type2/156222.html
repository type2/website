Subject: Re: [T2] Ozark Trail 11'x8' 'Dining Canopy on clearance at
  Wally World

I may go buy another one at that price.  Just my luck,  though.  Might even be closing it out.  I think you'll like  it.  Heck, at $17 they'ld be considered disposable.   Cheers...KR

today to check out the Ozark Trail 11'x8' 'Dining Canopy that Kevin Roberts
talked about a few weeks ago.  It has been marked down to $17!  Of course, I
picked one up.  Get them while they last.
