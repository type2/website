&gt; Mike, just curious, but to WHAT is the &quot;wire that runs up to the front for
&gt; the indicator&quot; connected to in the engine compartment area??

The indicator wire comes into the engine compartment, then there's a 
inter-connector, and then it's spliced into one of the connectors for 
the voltage regulator.

&gt; Mike, the bundle of 4 wires; are all four of them part of a [the] harness
&gt; that comes from the alternator??

 From my alternator are a total of 5 wires, 1 goes to the alternator, 4 
go towards the voltage regulator, but one of them breaks off a bit 
earlier and has an inter-connector on the end of it.

I would have thought it was for the aux battery, but it's live +12v all 
the time.

It's not *that* big of a deal as a I just put an isolator in 
(hellroaring_dot_com), but I thought I'd figure it out.

Mike
