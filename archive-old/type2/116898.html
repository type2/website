Subject: heater cable replacement problem

71 bus. As I try to pull the old cable out from the front..... the core wire 
is coming out, the 'spiral wrapping' wire is stretching and coming out, but 
most of the plastic outer sheathing seems to be staying inside the tube. At 
this rate I fear that I'll get all the wire out and leave most of the 
plastic sheathing inside the tube and be unable to get the new cable in. Any 
thoughts or suggestions greatly appreciated.
TIA
Best wishes
Denny Johnson
