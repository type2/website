Subject: Re: [T2] Hyd lifters and solid cam

&gt; I phoned Steve and Debbie at webcam a few months to ask some questions and
 they had this to say:
The pushrods have to match the lifters. another is
compatibility (hydraulic rods have an oiling hole down the center),
---------------------------------------------------------------------

HUH?  I am sorry, but Steve and Debbie are full of it. The solid lifter pushrods have an oiling hole down then
center also. Go back and ask them how the rockers get oiled on a VW air cooled engine......
