Subject: Re: [T2] warped flywheel? on 76 bus

Hi Cha,

I've seen that in a bus before, it happened back in 1986 when I was 
teaching my girlfriend (who is now my wife) to drive in my 72 westy. It 
takes a VERY steady foot to release the clutch, and the angle of the 
pedal often makes this harder to manage than on other vehicles. So it 
*might* be simple inexperience.

It could also be oil fouling the pressure plate, if there is any oil 
leaking around the bell housing an oil leak at the crank seal would be 
a likely cause of both the leak and the clutch chatter.

It could also be a broken clutch. I think you better drop the motor and 
have a look-see. If you'd ever seen a bus flywheel you would not 
imagine that it could get warped.

Happy trails,

&gt; miles tells me that he has never experienced the jumping and shakeing

&gt; could be  warped?
&gt;
&gt; Can this be possible?
&gt; how hard is the flywheel to change?
&gt; is it just the matter of unbolting it and bolting the other back on or 
&gt; what?
&gt; is this the best diagnosis of the shakeing and all even though it 
&gt; makes good sense.
