Subject: Re: [T2] New Pistons/cylinders Help!?

Hi Giles,

If your bus is smoking the first thing to do is a leakdown test. This 
will tell you the condition of the rings and valves.

If the leakdown test suggests that your rings are at fault then you 
need to drop the engine and pull the heads. Have a close look at the 
cylinders and rings and evaluate which set are better. It may be that 
all you need is a new set of rings.

Behind the fan shroud on the right side of the engine is a strange 
place for an oil leak. Could be caused by blow-by if you have a loose 
cylinder head, or by pushrod tubes or even the valve-cover gasket. Any 
leak on the front of the engine will quickly coat the fan shroud if you 
do much driving at speed.

A good way to trace an obscure oil leak is with dye. There are oil 
additives available that make the oil glow under a black (UV) light 
source. Simply add the magic ingredient and start the engine, then 
watch for leaks using a UV bulb in your trouble-light. I haven't tried 
this myself, but I'm told it is popular with racing mechanics.

Happy trails,

&gt; Ok folks,
&gt;
&gt; some kindly gentleman saw my bus smoking the other day, pulled in 
&gt; behind me
&gt; and handed me a set of cylinders and pistons from his but. He says 
&gt; that they
&gt; were rebuilt and they look clean and have numbers markered on the tops 
&gt; of
&gt; them ( One through four) so not used I guess. There's also stuff 
&gt; punched
&gt; into the top of pistons
&gt;
&gt; 93 97
&gt; 3
&gt; xh
&gt;
&gt; They've got a pretty decent crosshatch going on but I'm not sure that 
&gt; I can
&gt; just throw them in my bus without machining the engine case or heads. 
&gt; how
&gt; does that work? I can send photo's of these if anyone would like to 
&gt; give an
&gt; opinion.
&gt;
&gt; Also if my main seal behind the fan is faulty where is it going to be
&gt; leaking from? Right now there's oil all down the right side of the 
&gt; engine
&gt; starting in the corner of the valve cover and going back. It's also 
&gt; dripping
&gt; off the fan shroud and along the bottom, I've just replaced the tube 
&gt; seals
&gt; but its gotten worse since I did.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
