Mark,

I bought 3H Permatex Aviation Sealer (3H is in the upper left of the
&quot;front&quot; region of the bottle) at the Napa distribution center in Salt
Lake. The guys at the parts counter in Bountiful were less helpful. I
can grab you some and send it your way if you want 3H.

&gt; Meanwhile, no one has Permatex 3H. I have Gasgacinch on hand. If anyone 
&gt; thinks it's a poor choice to seal my case, yell now. NAPA has aviation 
&gt; gasket sealer, and it's Permatex, but it's not numbered 3H.
