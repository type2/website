Subject: RE: [T2] My bus blows all over the road..............

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any ideas?

Have you tried new shocks, and/or a Sway bar? Ratwell (type2_dot_com then to
Barting-tek) has a really good page on Sway Bars somewhere. I've heard
both those help being blown around quite a bit. I haven't tried any of
it personally though. Not yet anyway. :) I had to go across the city
(Seattle) yesterday and it quite kind of scary. I was doing well over 80
for about half an hour and having to watch out for anything bigger than
a sports car passing me. If it's bigger than a bug it would toss me
around quite a bit. It was my first time driving at above 65 and it
actually went pretty good. Ran like a charm with power to spare. :)
