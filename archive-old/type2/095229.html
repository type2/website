Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny Trouble



&gt;
&gt;Where exactly is it?
&gt;
&gt;Todle

You need to crawl underneath the Bus, and see where the tranny ends, at the 
middle of the vehicle.  Have someone in the vehicle shift gears, and you 
will hear the shift rod moving.  Or go buy the Bentley manual.  It will 
undoubtedly become one of your best friends.
