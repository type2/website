&gt; I have called 3 bookstores, the library, and a friend. No one has Tom
&gt; Wilson's 'How to Rebuild your Volkswagen Air-cooled Engine.' Does
anyone
&gt; have an extra copy, or know where i could find one? Maybe someone
could
&gt; photocopy the important parts? Thank you.

Any decent bookstore can order it.  The ISBN is 0-89586-225-5.  I got
my copy from The Bus Depot.

You don't want a photocopy, as the photographs won't reproduce well
and they are as importatant as the text.
