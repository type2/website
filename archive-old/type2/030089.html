Volks,

Intriguing &quot;Subject:&quot;, yes?  I am not talking here of two- or four-legged
travelling companions, but of books! :-)  

First, two introductory asides.  When I took my current job, I made a deal
with my boss.  I don't take two weeks every year, but rather four weeks
(OK, five :-) every other year.  I take Memorial Day thru July Fourth and
go driving around the United States or go touring in Europe.  This year I
will be travelling around the United States. Second, the first time I did
this, I went to Europe armed with nothing more than a one month Eurail
pass and 4 hours of cassette-tape German Language lessons.  I learned a
heck of a lot of German and Italian in those 4 weeks (contrary to what I
was told, everyone in Europe does *not* speak English and even if they
did, speaking the local language is basic politeness!) I also learned that
I was amazed at what I did not know about the scenery and culture I was
seeing.  Since then, I have made it a point to arm myself with as much
knowledge of the places I plan to see as I can, both before and during
these expeditions.

Because it is the beginning of touring season, and because we've discussed
what tools, spares, and camping supplies one ought to bring, I thought I
would ask, &quot;...but what about books?&quot;  I fell in love with the '68-73
Westy layout in part because there is a book-rack built right in behind
the driver's head :-)  I thought I would recommend a couple good books for
people planning to tour in the US and ask for further recommendations.

Most basically, a road atlas! I favor Gousha because they seem to have the
most tent symbols (non-commecial camping opportunities). Does anyone
prefer a different brand and why?

Second, for easterners out among the mountains of the west...  there is a
series of books entitled &quot;Roadside Geology of (State Name)&quot; that cover
most of the western states and will tell you all about those wonderful
formations you are seeing.  They also cover some eastern states, but not
as widely.

Third, for those interested in more off-beat attactions, there is
&quot;Roadside America&quot;, which is a specific guide to the very cheesiest of
tourist traps.  it covers such modern wonders as South of the Border in
SC; the Liberace Museum in Las Vegas, NV; the Corn Palace in Mitchell, SD;
and the various &quot;mystery spots&quot; in Gold Hill, OR and Santa Cruz, CA.

If you have any further recommendations, please e-mail me privately.  I
will gather them up and publish the list next Friday.

                           Steve Dolan
