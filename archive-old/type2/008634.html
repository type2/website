Well I think we need a simpler way  - I suggest adding the first two
vechicle designations then multiplying by the engine Type number then
divide by Pi , (which for the sake of simplicity we will round off to
only 7 decimal places) and finally if it is a westy then square the
result.  Therefore my 81 Westy becomes
{(2 + 3)*4/3.1415927}^2  or 40.528474  there, that,s simpler isn't it. 
No other VW can have this number desiganation - confusion ended!
