Subject: substitute for heat riser tube
Message-Id: &lt;v01510100b36e2acc20bd_at_[207.172.119.216]&gt;

A 1776 with Kadrons.  Used to have an extractor on this  but I'm
disappointed with the noise and with the heat generated in this part.  So I
am installing a stock muffler, hoping that it does not restrict the Kadrons
too much.

With the Kadrons, there is no need for the heat riser tube so I had planned
to cap off the flanges on the muffler where this tube usually goes.

I've read, perhaps in Hoover, that a stock engine depends on circulation
through the heat riser tube to balance the exhaust flow and that, if I do
cap off the flanges, I disturb this flow.

First question:  Is this lack of circulation something that we should be
concerned with?

Secondly, if so, perhaps i should connect the two flanges with a piece of
copper tubing, just to allow this flow.

I'd appreciate comments on all this.

Jack
