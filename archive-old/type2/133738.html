Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 Westy donor to '79 Kombi sunroof

Hi Greg,

Thanks for the clarification.  I hadn't thought about having the poptop just 
for added headroom or storage.  But then again, I'm lucky enough to have a 
double bed already in place.  Since my Bus is my daily-driver, large-scale 
conversions like that worry me.  However, given enough time, effort, and 
parts, I see no reason why a full Westfakia conversion can't be accomplished 
-- even here in America.  :-)

I suppose having an operable sunroof would be a good cold-weather solution 
to leaking poptop seals -- if it gets cold, just close the sunroof!

Best,
