Subject: Ignition troubles in Vancouver (BC); could use a hand

Hi Folks,

A friend has a dead '71 bus in Vancouver, and I'm not doing so well diagnosing
the problem, much less getting it resolved, from a distance.  Anyone in town
care to have a look?

Here's the situation, as it was described to me:
* Daily driver, drove fine the day before
* Ignition key doesn't turn as easily as it used to, as if there's some stiff
pressure against it
* No ignition lights when the key is turned
* Found a dead battery and replaced it; still can't get ignition, though other
electrical works
* Fan belt was a little loose; has been tightened now

If I were there, I'd run a jumper to the coil and bypass the ignition switch
to see if that's the problem, but my friend is mechanically disinclined and
can't do that test.  She's willing to have the bus towed to a shop, but I've
been extolling the virtues of our VW community and wanted to put this out
there to see what you all think.

Thanks!
Jerry
