&gt; I recently had the engine from the '67 Rusty rebuilt.  The block was line bored,
&gt; new main bearings installed, case savers installed, new filter/pump added, etc. 
&gt; In addition to that I just completed de-rusting my gas tank with some cool POR-15 &gt; stuff.  But, the damn thing won't idle!!!  I have a Solex 30 Pict 3 carb and
&gt; recently rebuilt it.  Obviously I don't know what I'm doing.  But, it did
&gt; idle before the motor was rebuilt so the carb may not be the trouble.
&gt; 
&gt; The guy that rebuilt the motor threw in a distributor.  I don't know the whole #
&gt; but the last three digits are '085.'  Is this an earlier version of an '009?' 
&gt; I have an 009 but the shaft is pretty worn out.  I tried using this distributor, 
&gt; the 009, mixing and matching caps/rotors with no discernable differences. --
&gt; Side note.  In another window I've been searching the vanagon archives and saw a &gt; message from wabbott where he describes the electromagnet cutoff.  Mine is 
&gt; installed but not hooked up.

If you do not put power to the electromagnetic cut off, you will not go!
This electromagnitic valve shuts OFF the fuel to your idel jet when you
turn your key off. 


&gt; What do I connect it to?


Connect it to the hot wire GOING TO your coil, not to the lead from your
coil to your dist.


&gt; I have the automatic choke hooked up but don't really know how to adjust it.


With the engine COLD, set it so that the choke plate is JUST closed.
There are marks, but this will get you *close enough*. ;&gt;)


&gt; Is the wire connected to the auto choke supposed to always carry +12V when the key is on?


YES.


&gt; Or is this wire supposed to go the cutoff. --


BOTH -- you need power to three places, coil, electromag cut-off, &amp;
choke.

 
&gt; I need to have the bus running well enough by Sunday to move it to my new house. 
&gt; I suppose I could limp it there but in addition to not idleing it isn't running 
&gt; that great.  Don't get me wrong, the rebuild is great, but the carb/ignition is &gt; &gt; hosed.
&gt; 
&gt; Whaddoido?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA,

Have fun. Let me know how it goes.
