my 78 with auto tranny, mostly stock FI 2liter

have been having a problem with intermitent missing at random speeds.

.  doesn't do it when cold, only after engine warms up
.  tends to do it most when cruising around 60MPH
        but does it at all speeds/RPMs
.  tends not to do it much under full throttle/load at any speed
.  I suspect electrical problem
.  been over a month this has been going on, getting a little worse but
not significantly...drove over 150 miles on interstate today, did not get
better or worse on drive.  (drive to failure or diagnose, no luck)

...
have 
. changed fuel filter
. checked all connections
. checked for vacuum leaks
. dizzy shaft doesn't wobble
. night check shows no apparent dizzy cap leakage

next on the agenda.
.  swap out AFM

any suggestions  (I have Pentronix so no points)


Bob
