Subject: Re: [T2] Type 3 engine conversion

It boils down to parts availability and cost.

I have lots of type 1 parts that won't fit on the type 3.... I have 3 
new stock type 1 exhausts... and I can't find a *quality* exhaust setup 
for the type 3 at a reasonable cost...just those aftermarket 
&quot;performance&quot; things that tend to rust away after one new england 
winter... I'm missing the intermediate heater boxes (the ones that are 
between the muffler and heater boxes..) from the type 3 and they are 
expensive to replace. I haven't seen a good quality aftermarket solution 
to replace the complete type 3 exhaust.

I also have a new carb and manifold for a type 1 setup which won't work 
on the type 3 (i'm pretty sure). I have no available dual carb setups to 
put on the type 3.

I figured it would be more economical to go out and find the parts to 
convert to type 1 style than get a dual carb setup and exhaust that 
would complete the type 3 setup. If I had the parts, it would be a 
different story.

The purpose of this engine is to swap into the bus while I rebuild the 
tired type 4 that is badly leaking oil out of the  flywheel seal. I 
fully expect the 1600cc to buy me some time to complete the job and then 
maybe end up in another bus in the near future.

&gt;why not run it as a type 3 engine it will fit.
