&gt;My final questions on the subject:
&gt;
&gt;- does Dr. Tim think the reinforced Continental tire that just appeared is
&gt;the &quot;perfect tire&quot; for a late bay ( older than 1971) Camper?
&gt;
&gt;- if the reinforced tire is appropriate does the 185R14C tire provide for
&gt;better handling when used on a Camper?

If I could have found the 14C Load Range D tires in Continentals, that's 
what I would have got, damn the cost or warranty or mileage. The CR-21's 
are the closest I could find in a quality brand. They meet the low specs 
and will serve just fine on my stripped Kombi. I just got them in hand 
today, and my first impression is, I like the tread design. At least the 
lug design looks like it will be reasonable quite on the highway and still 
give some good grip in the bit of snow and slush I'm likely to see every 
third winter or so. If I had a loaded down Westy I would want a higher load 
range than these, just like the Bentley calls for. These are perhaps a 
perfect compromise for a Kombi.

Note that the tires made in Europe meet TUV specs. I don't think anything 
made in the US does. I know for sure the Michelins made at the UniRoyal 
plant here are junk compared to the genuine French Michelins. Note these 
CR-21's are made in Sweden. I have yet to see ANYTHING made in Sweden that 
wasn't very high quality. I'll report further after I get them mounted.

Next time your at a big truck stop, go around and look at the tires on the 
big semi's. You will be amazed at the very high percentage of Continentals. 
Why??? Lowest cost per mile via fewer problems over the long haul.
