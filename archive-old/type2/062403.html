Subject: World's Weakest VW Event

        This message almost has no VW content, this get-together was so bad.

        I went to the s'posed SOTO Picnic at Ancil Hoffman park this
morning. I get there at ~9:00, sleeping in because of a volleyball hangover.
There are two busses there, mine making three.   One of the guys I knew, so
we bs'd for a bit.

        About 15 minutes after I got there, Dave Heard and Eric Hand showed
up.  They went over and talked to the other bus guys, then wandered off into
the woods.  They just disappeared: I have no idea where they went...

        So this other guy and I went and talked to the other bus crew for a
few, showed them pix of the '54, then everyone left.  I was home by 9:30 or so.

        SOTO is dead.

        Hope the 'Rama tomorrow is better...  Any list people going?
