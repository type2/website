Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line cutoff alternative

Has anyone looked at some Porsche racing sites? It sounds 
like the kind of safety gear a race car would have.

Thanks,
Chris

&gt;Got the catalog here.  did a search for gasoline and only 
find the FL206 
&gt;as suitable for gasoline.  The local supplier also could 
only find that 
&gt;one for gasoline.  All other &quot;gas&quot; valves in their catalog 
are natural 
&gt;gas or propane.
&gt;thanks
