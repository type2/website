Subject: Hyd valve adj. question

I was adjusting my Hyd valves today, and am unsure of something. After I
had loosened the adjuster and and turned it down to contact the top of
the valve I pulled the rocker back and forth to make sure it was in firm
contact. Then I noticed I could turn the adjuster an aditional 1/4 turn
by finger before resistance was felt.

Should I adjust the valves to first (firm) contact, or when this
resistance is felt?

Thanks
