&gt;   A huge thanks to &quot;Karl&quot; _at_
&gt;                  &lt;aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;
&gt; For the slider roof cables ..... a hard to find item
&gt; and one I had about given up on...


Well, Karl has been an incredible benefactor of late.  He graciously
offered me the sink /ice box parts I inquired about.  He didn't even
tell me where to send the $ before dropping the parts in the mail.  Not
to mention the price wasn't even work his time to box them!

We won't be thirsty on our next camping trip.  Cold beer and lotsa water
on hand!

So here's to Karl
HIP HIP..HOORAY! HIP HIP..HOORAY! HIP HIP..HOORAY!

thanks again Karl.

P.S. Also, thanks to all of you who helped with pictures and
explainations of the parts. It made installation easy.
