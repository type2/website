Subject: Re: [T2] Bay Z-bed in a 60

I got 18.75&quot; in my '74. You're going about it
correctly. The only thing is, the relationship between
the back of the bottom cushion and the backrest
cushion is a bit of a bear to figure out. As I recall,
it will be the thickness of the backrest cushion that
will determine the thickness of all the cushions. If
you don't get that placement just right, it won't work
in the seat position. I gave up on the Z-beds after my
second one. They took up too much storage room and
were too heavy. I opted for the other Westy style
which uses a special hinge between the #1 &amp; #2
cushions and has a bracket under the #1 cushion that
engages the top of the front board under the seat. The
front board has a piece of steel on it as stiffener. I
feel much more secure on this bed than on my Z-beds. I
think there are pics in my albums - I can dig some up
if not and if yer interested. -BaH
