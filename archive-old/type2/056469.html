Well, the day has nearly arrived.
We'll load up the Ryder tomorrow, strap Kermit to the back, then ride off
into the sunrise Friday morning bound for Idaho. Engine is in, new clutch
too -- plus new grease up front, adjusted brakes and a new accel cable --
for a grand total of (feelin' faint here folks) $3,375.
Gulp. It's done. And it's warrenteed for a year. Heck, with the new paint,
new engine and new everything else, I've sunk almost $9K into this beast,
and that's still worlds cheaper than a brand new E*rovan (just toured a
used one last week for kicks -- 1995 for $25,000 -- YIKES!).
So, guess this is hasta la vista for now.
Mark, also of San Juan Island, who hopefully got down good and righteous at
Phish at the Gorge, take care. Enjoy the archipelago life :-)

To all the rest of you,
see you soon online.
