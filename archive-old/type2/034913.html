Subject: Porch light?

Does anyone on the list have a nifty way to install a porch light on a VW 
camper? I want to do so before my next trip of any length, and I have 
come up with just two ideas.

Idea #1: Install automotive sidelights salvaged from junkyard. I noticed 
that the front sidelights on my Saab 900 are slender enough to be turned 
90 degrees and neatly installed on the bus B pillars. Very trim and 
streamlined. But the yellow lens means less porch illumination for the 
amp hours invested; white would be better.

Idea #2: Install photographic hot shoes on the B pillars, and fix their 
complements to proprietary RV porch lights. Then I could slip the porch 
lights on and off in camp. Trouble is installing the hardware to bus and 
to light.

I'm out of ideas. The purpose of the light is to be able to create a dim 
pool of light in the campsite when I am inside the camper at night, and 
as a marker for late evening sojourns to the vault.
