Dear Jack.

RE: Installing oil pressure sending unit, on a 1972~79 VW 17/18/2000
    Type 2 engine

For the spacer mast, I used two female-female, in-line metric brake pipe 
connectors and two old 1976~79 VW 2000 Type 2 engine, valve-rocker 
adjustment screws (drilled through on a lathe), all of which have M10 x 
1.0mm non-tapered threads, which fit perfectly into the matching, 
non-tapered hole in the crankcase.

It is difficult to describe a banjo fitting in words, but it is commonly 
used in hydraulic and fuel injection systems, to create an easily pivoted, 
right-angled joint, using a ring connection resembing a banjo and a hollow, 
cross-drilled bolt.

If you would be willing to find me a few feather-weight items on your next 
trip to the wrecker's yard, I will send you my illustrated information 
sheet, plus my 1964~79 VW Type 2 pantograph rear-window article, which was 
published in VW Motoring in December 1996.

I only have access to the Internet, via the public library terminal, which 
does not have the facility to send e-mail attachments.

Regards.

        Nigel A. Skeet
