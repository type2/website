That is indeed the only spec Bentley gives. It is the only way to do it to 
insure consistentcy.
TDC at each cylinder for those valves every time, all the time.

I set them wide a bit for new motor run in. 20 minutes of warm up and 
another 20 mile drive, then dump the oil and cool it down and verify the 
valve lash. Stable?? OK, check again at a 1000 miles?? Once dialed in, then 
once per year or more depending upon what your monitoring and noting with 
the valve over time tell you the interval correct for your type of uses. 
Maintain your specs by actual inspection, not by rule of thumb directives 
from passers by who heard it from their Dad. If there are no notes, it was 
not a proper inspection. It is just hearsay.
