Subject: rear shock absorber removal

Hi all:

I am attempting to replace the rear shocks on my '79 Bus and I've run
into a little problem.

The upper bolt attaching the right rear shock is turning loosely and
will not come out. I tried to find the other end of the bolt, figuring
there'd be a nut I could put a wrench on, but I haven't been able to
locate it. The bolt seems to go into the side of the wheel well
approximately where the gas tank is located. Does anyone know how to get
at the other end of the bolt? Do I have to take the gas tank out?

Of course, there may not be a nut on the end of the bolt, and the bolt
may instead turn into some portion of a body member which has given out.
If that is the case, does anyone know a work-around? Any advice will be
greatly appreciated.

Rob Mead
