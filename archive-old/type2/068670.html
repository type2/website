&gt; Does anyone have (or have access to a junkyard which would have) a metric 
&gt; speedometer/odometer combination for a '74 Bus?  I've been driving the 
&gt; metric Jetta for so long that I'm not used to this &quot;miles&quot; thing anymore 
&gt; (though if I mistakenly get on the highway and try to cruise at 100, the 
&gt; bus quickly explains what I'm doing wrong! :) )  Do any of you folks in 
&gt; Canada or Europe have them?  (Does anyone know if they'll fit on a 
&gt; US-market bus?)  

Well Tom...if you remember way back, we didn't go metric here until
the late 70's (although the entire process took several years...some
may argue that it still isn't complete].  Most cars here up until '77
or '78 had the spedo/odo in miles.  If I remember correctly, the unit
in my old VW had the odo in kilometers and the speedo had both.  

However, I am sure that a European speedo/odo would do the trick.


Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!
