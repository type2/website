Matt:  Sounds a bit expensive, especially with an engine problem. 
Note, too, that water-cooled vans (if it is one, and I suspect it is)
from '83 until maybe '85 or '86 had a lot of expensive engine-heat
problems.  After asking this same question of this group about six
months ago, I settled on an '82 vanagon with the air-cooled engine, just
rebuilt at 100,000, for $2,200 (in San Francisco yet), which I plan to
convert into a sleeper/camper as needed, easily done.  I suggest that
you be patient and try to find a private owner who has taken good care
of his/her van/wesfalia but is moving to something else.  I don't think
most dealers know much about their used vehicles, and likely don't want
to.  Cheers...
