Please finish the heat page!!!  It sucked me in. . . I want heat -
Did you find anyway to keep the oil smell out of the heat exchangers?

Absolutely no oil smell.
Expensive solution, though. Replace the exchangers, riser tubes and 
flappers, or (some how???) clean them of all traces of oil. Rebuild the 
motor, and learn and use EVERYTHING YOU CAN about preventing oil leaks on 
VW's. I have read stuff here on the list about the importance of completely 
cleaning all traces of crud in the push-rod tube seal grooves, about making 
sure the P/C to head area is properly machined and torqued, etc. etc. etc. 
 etc. ...bottom line is keep oil away from the heater stuff.
Also, make sure your engine-tin-&amp;-surrounding-foam is in good shape. It is 
imperative (for a lot of reasons), that the air going into the cooling fan 
is from ABOVE the van, not below.
I will do my best to get the rest of the heat stuff posted in the next week 
or two. Thanks for your patience.
