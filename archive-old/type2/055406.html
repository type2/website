Hi Volks!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;65mph in third gear????
&gt;
&gt; Is that OK to do that??  Didn't it sound like the engine was gonna blow?  I 
&gt; have a 1600 and would be so scared to do that.

And rightly so.  FWIW, the original rev limiter in my
'72, 1600 Type 1 engine Panel Van cuts in at about
80 kph, or 50 mph, in 3rd gear.  I rarely go even that
far.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
