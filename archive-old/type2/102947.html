Subject: Re:coilover shocks-were they ever VW option?

&quot;Sharpe, Steven (Facilities Planning)&quot; wrote:
&gt; The function of the shock absorbers is to control the bounce as you drive
&gt; over stuff. Normal shock absorbers do not support weight. The points where
&gt; the shock absorbers mount to the bus were not designed to carry the weight

&gt; springs you run the risk of damaging the shock mounting points.

Hmmm, I put those coilovers in my 78 Westy around 120,000 and now it's
240,000 mi, and they've survived Philly potholes (Philadelphia)- but
your point is well taken- but like shear pins in a tractor, I think
you'd have the mounting bolts fail first.  I assume they  don't take all
the load; just share it with the torsion bars.  I have a vague memory of
some stock VW parts option that had coilovers; can anyone verify this?
