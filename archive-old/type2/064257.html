Subject: Trip report: Kruger National Park (long)

Howdy volks

Well, I'm back on the list after a week's break, during which my wife and
two small girls and I travelled to the Kruger National Park in the 63
Dormobile.

We left home on Friday the 13th, a little later than planned, but were
pleased to be heading out of the city on another camping trip. The first
few hundred kilometres East of Johannesburg is flat, dry and very dreary,
but with a tailwind we were able to make good time, keeping to the Dorm's
maximum speed of 100km/h for most of the way. At the little village of
Belfast we left the highway -- our intention was to take two days to reach
Kruger so we would have time to see some of the sights along the way. 50km
beyond Belfast we stopped for lunch in the village of Dullstroom, a resort
frequented by trout fishermen.

While we were waiting for our lunch order I noticed a man taking
photographs of the Dormobile so I went out to chat to him. It turned out he
was an Austrian tourist and spoke no English, but with my rudimentary
understanding of German I was able to discover that he was a member of the
Bulli club in Vienna and had three split buses back home. He was very
excited to see the Dormobile.

After Dullstroom we began the steep descent of the escarpment (much of
South Africa is on a 2 000m plateau) which proceeded in a series of fast,
sweeping bends which the Dormobile took at top speed, until we reached
Lydenburg, a small town on the escarpment. From Lydenburg we continued the
descent via the Long Tom Pass, named after a Boer siege gun used to good
effect against the British, which now stands as part of a monument at the
top of the pass. We were glad to be travelling down the pass rather than up
it, as the road drops 1 000m in a seemingly endless series of hairpin bends
over a few kilometres. Overall, the gradient averages about 1:8 on this
section.

At the end of the Long Tom Pass is the logging town of Sabie, where we
planned to camp the night. After checking out the town's two campsites, we
settled on the municipal caravan park, which cost half as much as the
privately-owned campsite on the opposite bank of the the Eland's River. The
more expensive park had loads of facilities such as tennis courts and
saunas and what have you, and was quite crowded. We were very happy to
settle down in the municipal campsite which was nearly deserted and had the
only facilities we really needed: hot and cold running water. We spent the
afternoon viewing the several beautiful waterfalls around Sabie.

We left Sabie early next morning with the intention of circumnavigating the
Blyde River Canyon (no roads cross it!) before entering the Kruger Park at
one of the more southerly gates. First stop was God's Window, a viewpoint
at the head of the canyon with sweeping vistas from the top of 500m cliffs.
God's Window is part of the Blyderivierspoort Nature Reserve, which
features the last part of the indigenous rainforest that once covered the
whole area, before it was all cut down and replaced by plantations of
Bluegum and Pine.

&gt;From God's Window we skirted the canyon to Bourke's Luck Potholes, an
interesting geological feature named after the prospector who found a
fortune in alluvial gold in the potholes last century. Having finished a
picnic lunch at Bourke's Luck we took stock -- we had planned to drive
right round the canyon and enter Kruger at Orpen gate, then travel north to
our destination at Letaba camp. However, because we were behind schedule we
decided to take the most direct route, entering the Kruger Park at the town
of Phalaborwa, whose only reason for existence is the huge opencast
base-metal mine nearby.

The Kruger Park is made for old Type 2s -- the tar road speed limit is
50km/h and on the gravel roads 40km/h, which is why we had decided not to
enter the park at Orpen gate, as we would then have had to drive over 120km
at those speeds and we were worried about getting to Letaba by the 6pm
curfew. If you don't get back to camp before gates close, you get fined --
no visitors are allowed to travel in the park after dark; here it's the
people who are caged while the animals run free. Although the Kruger
National Park is by no means the world's biggest, it is still a huge slice
of virgin bushveld reserved only for the wild animals that live in it -- a
slice of Africa as she was before Europeans arrived. The park stretches
650km north to south and between 60-100km east to west -- larger than the
state of Israel.

The next few days were spent game viewing in the early morning, returning
to camp for a leisurely breakfast, then lounging around reading in the heat
of the day, or sometimes sitting at a waterhole watching the comings and
goings of the widlife, and then more game viewing drives in the late
afternoon. We also signed up for a night drive, where a game ranger takes a
truckload of tourists armed with searchlights on a game drive after dark --
definitely the best way to see the widlife and all the more interesting for
the extensive knowledge that the rangers have of the park's natural
history.

Midway through the week we moved to Crocodile Bridge camp, at the southern
extremity of the park and 200km from our camp at Letaba. 200km is about the
farthest one can travel in a day in the park without breaking the speed
limits. The next few days at Crocodile Bridge were just more of the same,
although the southern end of the park is less dry than the north, with a
corresponding increase in the animal population.

During the drive from Letaba to Orpen the Dormobile gave its only
mechanical hassle of the whole trip -- in the middle of nowhere, the brakes
locked up after I had used them to slow down. The pedal had no free play
and was rock solid and the car wouldn't move. Very mysterious. I eventually
had to get out of the car (illegal for obvious reasons) and, while my wife
kept a wary eye out for large predators, I bled the pressure off all four
wheel cylinders, which unlocked the brakes and allowed us to proceed to the
next camp at Satara, where the Automobile Association has a workshop. The
AA mechanic helped me to bleed the brakes and the problem was solved. I'm
still not sure of the cause, but perhaps it was an air lock that had got
hot and expanded. I had a reconditioned gearbox fitted shortly before we
left and I don't think the guys that fitted it bled the brakes properly
afterwards.

In the Kruger Park we saw three other air-cooled VWs: a ca70 bug with Cape
Town plates (CT is over 2 000km from Kruger), a ca72 bus which looked like
it had been everywhere and back again, and a ca73-78 westy. Our old
Dormobile also drew lots of waves and smiles from other park visitors in
their newer cars.

We left the park on Friday morning shortly after the gates opened. The
first part of this stretch featured wonderful scenery as the road wound
along the path of the Crocodile river through the mountains north of
Swaziland until we reached the town of Nelspruit, which is the capital of
Mpumalanga province. Because I was feeling paranoid about the brakes I
thought I'd try my luck finding new seals for the master and all the wheel
cylinders. I replaced them a year ago, but I was a bit nervous of having to
do a major brake job after the mysterious lock-up. I thought it would be a
long shot, but the first FLAPS I tried had ALL the seals IN STOCK, and for
no more than I would have paid in Johannesburg, where I have struggled to
find them in the past. I bought the lot, but, as it turned out, we had no
further brake problems on the journey home.

About 50km past Nelspruit we took a detour to visit the Sudwala caves, a
network of Dolomite caves which stretch several kilometres into a hillside
and which have not yet been fully explored.  The hour-long guided tour was
very interesting and the natural features -- stalactites, stalagmites,
heliotites(?) and so on were quite something.

&gt;From there began the climb back up the escarpment, though on this route it
is quite gentle. So gentle in fact that I wasn't really aware the road was
climbing, but the car was feeling the hills, which re-ignited the old
locking brake paranoia ... Regular stops to check on the heat of the drums
told me all was well tho.

At the top of the escarpment lies the historic village of Waterval Boven,
where we camped for the night. Next morning had us seeing the sights
(beautiful waterfall, historic rail tunnel and bridges) before hitting the
road home. From there on in the flat boring countryside was all we passed
through until a progressive browning of the sky told us we were approaching
the filthy metropolis of Johannesburg.

And now I'm back at work trying to get my head into the right gear. Another
successful journey in the faithful Dormobile is behind us and we're already
planning our next one ... :-)

Thanks for reading this lengthy epistle.
