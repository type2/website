Subject: Tatra aircooled V-8 engine for trade

Recently rebuilt Tatra V-8 engine for sale or trade in middle TN.

This a small aircooled V-8 engine from an early 80's Tatra. It has been 
modifed to run GM fuel injection and comes with a full set of shop manuals 
and a box full of repair parts.

The engine will fit in the engine bay of a baywindow bus and will start and 
run for demonstration purposes. It has about 10K miles on a rebuild

I am wanting to sell this engine for $500 or for trade of a late model 2.0 
VW Type IV in good running condition.

Also available at extra cost is an adapter plate to mate this engine to a 
late baywindow VW transaxle.

This is an 180 HP engine that is ready to go anywhere you are!



(Just kidding - it's FRIDAY!!!!)
