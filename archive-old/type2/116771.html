Subject: BN 4 Wiring Questions

Hi Volks-

Thanks to those who sent links to the BN4 Manuals. I have been able to
&quot;hotwire&quot; my heater and get it to run, but am having trouble getting it
properly connected in the van.

Question 1: There is a small grey wire that has been cut off that protrudes
from the same loom as the wire that goes to the fuse holder. I cannot find any
grey wires in the wiring diagram. What does this connect to?

Question 2: Where should the van side of the fuse holder be connected?

Question 3: What does the switch located on top of the gas tank do, and what
does it's cable running up to the drivers seat do?

Thanks for your help!

Cheers,
Matthew
