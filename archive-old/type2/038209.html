Subject: Engine rebuilders

I'd highly recommend getting a rebuild from Bob (boston engine).  I ordered
a long block from him last summer &amp; was/am very happy.  Even after you get
your engine from him, he likes to know how it's running &amp; will answer any
questions/problems you may have.  He also sends a nice indepth sheet of
'what to do's' about breaking the engine in.  I was very impressed &amp; happy.
: )

&gt;If you haven't taken a look at Boston Bob Donalds' operation,  then
you may be missing a rebuilder who is highly regarded on the
List......  and he is in your backyard.  Check out
