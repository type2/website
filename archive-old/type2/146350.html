&gt;My 78 ASI/Riviera has a factory installed BA6 as well.
&gt; In my travels, I have found many 78 and 79 era Bays
&gt;fitted with BA6 heaters.  BA6 heaters were factory
&gt;installed into late seventies type twos.

They were fitted as early as 74. The Canadian campers were often fitted with them.
