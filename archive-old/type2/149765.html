&gt; Replaced the fuel lines on my '79 FI Bus yesterday.
&gt; Had one start to leak on me. Fortunately, I recently

&gt; Great kit guys!
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to make a suggestion for those with FI and are
&gt; planning to replace their fuel lines. Go ahead and order
&gt; a set of injector seals and have them handy.

Darren,

Thanks for the comments.

I have added the injector seals to the kit. The kit price will go up by
4.00, which is less than the cost of the seals if purchased separately. They
should have been in the kit anyhow.
