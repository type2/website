Hi Volks! Last winter my bus was in the garage for complete repairs until spring, so this Christmas I finally got to put a wreath on her.It fits right around the emblem and attaches w/wire to the screws on the grill(underneath where the metal piece goes because that's being painted). I don't have enough money for lights this year, because I'm in school, but maybe next year.I'll have my dad help me design something cool,because he's an electrician.But I did  make a big VW symbol out of lights on my garage in front of where I park. My bus is also on my X-mas cards w/the tree on her. My friend says I'm obsessed because &quot;it's only a car&quot;.It's not like it's tattood on me or anything,at least not yet.Maybe I need new friends .At least I know you guys understand and I'm not the only insane one like everyone says I am.
Peace and Happy Holidays!
