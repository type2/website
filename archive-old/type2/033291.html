&gt; But with a little imagination (and the stock movable seat that sits
between the
&gt; buckets in the 72+walk-through) no amorous sacrifices must be made, and I
assume
&gt; we will be structurally sound no matter HOW vigorous it becomes! :)

Huh?  - Now *that* sounds interesting.   Anyone know where I could find such
a 'middle seat' (in the UK) ?
And would it fit a '70 ?
