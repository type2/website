Hi,

&gt; I had my timing light set up and as I got the RPM's up the light
became
&gt; intermittent just as the engine began to run rougher.

 Points bouncing or otherwise playing up?

 There's a slim possibility that the coil (or even the condensor) is
failing at high rpms when the current flow is higher.

Cheers,
	W.
