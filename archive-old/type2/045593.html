&gt; Looking for the little strap that holds the door under my sink from opening
all the way in my westy.

I've read a couple of the other posts (nylon webbing strap, flat chain) and 
they are both good ideas.  The original item was a piece of plastic that 
doubled up in the middle.  It either breaks there, or where it attaches to 
the cabinetry.

I used a length of wire (stranded &amp; insulated) with crimp-on connectors at 
each end.
