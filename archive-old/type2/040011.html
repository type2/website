Subject: Re: 5-day Oil Change

My oil light comes on pretty often now.  I checked the oil level and there's
plenty in it.  I talked to a mechanic and he says it's probably just a short
in the wiring, but it seems to happen only when I rev the engine.  I just
bought my '75 adventure van about a month ago, so I don't know what filter
is on it.  Could the oil light blinking be a result of the wrong filter?

&gt;  come across the mention in the Library.
