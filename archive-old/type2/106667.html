&gt;'On/off valve seat events' is called ramp speed.

or Ramp Rate.

&gt;Lift and duration has nothing to do with ramp speed.

Well, they are related.  With a greater ramp rate you can have more lift and duration with less negative effects (mostly from less overlap).

&gt;Ramp speed has to be slower on hydraulic lifter cams, mainly on the valve closing side. If it is too fast, the
&gt;lifter will float and pump up. The lifter cannot follow the cam and have a gap between it and the cam. Oil
&gt;pressure then pumps up the lifter and the valve stays open.  This will happen way before redline is hit.

Understood, but I still maintain that there are hydraulic cams out there with aggressive ramp rates and significant lift and duration that manage to spin well past 6,000rpm.  I own one myself and drove it to work today!  I am not just throwing words around here.  These cams exist for other engines and I don't understand the &quot;inherent limitation&quot; everyone seems to take for granted in a type IV engine.  Are the hydraulic lifters inferior to those used in other engines?  That I could accept.  Are the valve springs much weaker than in other engines?  That I could understand also.  But tell me there is no way to have a more aggressive cam in a hydro engine and I will always disagree.
