Subject: Re: [T2] Re:liquid repair for loose ball joints?

Ahh, yes--the miracle in a tube---
Brought to you live by Warshawsky's (aka JC Whitney) for one---
And after you deposted this glue into your failing ball joints--I know
it produced 10% better fuel economey too--:&gt;)

Garbage---

This classifies real close to the &quot; Ring Seal&quot; goop you squeezed from a
tube, into the spark plug holes to rebuild your engine--another miracle
in a can ( tube in this case ) that flopped--

Yea--right---;&gt;)_

Later,

Terry

[T2] Re:liquid repair for loose ball joints?
While on the subject fo liquid thread replacement, does anyone know if
they still sell that worn ball joint tightener that was squirted into
the gap between ball and socket and set to a self lubricating layer that
reduced play to zero? Back in the 70's it was called Liqui-Seal or such?
