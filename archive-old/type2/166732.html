Subject: Re: [T2] Paint question...

&lt;&lt;Any Pro painters? Can I get an opinion on BASF's Glasurit paint?&gt;&gt;

Very expensive, don't ay it on too heavy, It's gas hole the finish---be
sure to over reduce it a tad to get it to lay down flat.

Now, Anthony, are you talking single stage or two?

Either way the stuff is not as easy to use, and over priced.

In my professional opinion, PPG Concept, either single stage, or base
clear is a much better refinishing material , is easier to use, and with
a little over reduction will lay down flat so you can see yourself in
the paint as itis applied.

What's the brand and the model of the gun your going use?

Big paint quality difference in the spray gun you use.

If your thinking about using a HLVP, you might as well roll and brush
the paint on.
You'll have the concrete block look in no time at all.
