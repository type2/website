&gt; I currently have a 71 bus with a Type 1 case that has an adapter
mounted

&gt; 2.  I purchased the bus this way and I am having no problems with this
&gt; setup at the moment.  My question is if I should leave this setup
alone
&gt; or if I should drill and tap the case to accept the rear hanger for
the
&gt; 71 Type 2.  Does anybody have any long-term experience with this
&gt; adapter?

Unfortunately, if you have a type 1 &quot;bug&quot; case, there isn't any metal
to drill and tap.  The bosses weren't cast onto the case.  That's why
you have the adapter.  The only way to get back to stock configuration
is to replace the case with a universal type 1 case.

I've known of people who have done OK with the adapter, but I'm
awfully leery of hanging the entire weight of the engine from the oil
pump studs.  That mounting location supports half of the weight of the
engine/transmission, and also takes the reaction torque loads of the
rear axle. A pretty tall task for those little studs.
