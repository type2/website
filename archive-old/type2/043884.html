If you happen to have a mini-mag-light flashlight (the aluminum one that
takes AA batteries) it is the perfect size to use as a pilot tool for a
type 1 engine.

I've also lined up the clutch plate without a pilot tool simply by making
sure that the pilot bearing is centered in the splined hole. Just snug
down the pressure plate bolts slightly and you'll be able to slide the
clutch plate around to position it.
