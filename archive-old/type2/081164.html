I just got done pulling the passenger side heat exchanger and notice on =
the old one there is a coupling around the front of the heat exchanger =
that fits into the rubber baffle that looks like asbestos. Anyone know =
if that is asbestos and can I replace it with something else or just =
leave it off.=20
Also,just wanted to say that the pics and stories from EB 2002 are =
great.  Really should try to get there next year.  Is it always the same =
weekend in April.
