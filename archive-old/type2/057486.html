Hi,

I am new to this list. I just ran into a 74 Westy with a blown engine. I
would like to get it on the road as quick as possible. So if anyone of you
out there (esp. those in the D.C. / MD area) has a running 1.8L (AP) or 2.0L
(CJ) engine with decent compression please respond to:

An inexpensive parts car or a manual 2L tranny plus clutch pedal, cable, and
shifter would be nice, too (I hate automatic transmissions).
Is there anything else I need when converting to manual transmission?
Also, I am searching for a green tinted windshield, a green driver's door
pop out window, orange front door covers, and a &quot;VW 1800&quot; badge that goes on
the trunk lid (all for 74 Westy).

2 74 Westys (one back in Germany, one here lacking engine)
