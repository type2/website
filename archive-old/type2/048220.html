Subject: [T2] sque sque sque squeak

so about a week ago I suddenly had a constant squeak when driving, sounding 
like it came from the wheels. OK, thinks I, the PO fudged the truth a little. 
he didnt re do the wheel bearings with the brakes. Then, the next day it was 
gone. only to return on the next cold day. Gone yesterday when it was warm 
and sunny. My imagination? coincidence? why would the temperature have an 
affect? Should I pack the bearings  with grease and call it good? or have I 
done done damge driving about squeaking that warrants replacing the bearings? 
gotta drive a few hundred miles next weekend and my AAA ran out.
thanks
ronnie
