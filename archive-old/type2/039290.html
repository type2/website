All,

Another alternative I will prob. use in my bus is wainscoting - available at
Lowe's, Home Despot or an upscale home-fixup store near you.  The pieces are
small enough to handle and transport, fairly cheap and thin enough (around 1/16
- 3/32) to take a bend .. I would recommend hitting both sides with a coat of
appropriate sealer prior to installation.  My 2 centavos for this Friday  :o)
