Hey Y'all,
  On my 73 bus there is a brass sensor above the battery. Is this a
temp sensor? It has only one terminal on it. If so what was it
connected to? And what temp does it open or close?
I am hoping that it was used to tell the engine when its cold out and
it closes at a low temp, I want to use it to triger an electic/vacuum
solinoid that will control a pod on the air cleaner that I want to
install. I have a Weber carb and want to duct hot air to it when cold.
I am hoping this can be used to do that.
