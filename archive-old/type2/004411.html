I have a 73' Bus which runs fine in the summer but as winter starts and the
temp falls she gets harder to live with. Although she starts well and idles
on choke for 3-4 minutes she then stalls. When I restart she needs to have
some gas to keep ticking over. If I warm her up for 5 minutes or so and
drive off she stalls when I take my foot off the gas. She can take over ten
minutes before she is warm enough to idle, she also tends to die on constant
gas and will need reving.

I live in Southern England and I need to use the bus for work 5 days a week
but at the moment she is such a pain to use in rush hour traffic that I'm at
the end of the line. If anyone can give advice, and stop me having to keep
reving, it would be appreciated.
