&gt; Has to do with the brakes, fellas.
&gt;
&gt; It's either a warning light for low fluid in the reservoir (sp?) or a
warning
&gt; light for the e-brake being on.
&gt;
&gt; First clue?  The &quot;B&quot;.  hmmm.

Well it's not a fluid level light, a VW Bus is not that high-tech (i.e. it's
not a Mercedes, which does have such a thing).

The brake light serves two purposes, depending on model year:  1) To notify
you that the parking brake is on and 2) To notify you of a pressure loss in
the brake system.

Apparently not all years have the first function but all years do have the
second.  If you push on the brake and that light comes on it indicates low
pressure in one of the brake hydraulic circuits...i.e. FIX IT NOW
