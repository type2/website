Subject: Bumper colour..again

Hey gang...

I recall this question being asked in the past...but couldn't bring up
an answer, or anything in the archives at all this morning.for that
matter.

Sunwarrior goes to paint this week, and I need to strip &amp; re-finish the
bumpers...so what's the colour code for the white, and what's the
collective take on the best paint type to stand up against weathering??

Thanks a bunch...

Hope everyone is having a great weekend..

Den.
