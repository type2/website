David:

Here's Owens-Corning's URL describing the stuff:

  http://www.owenscorning_dot_com/owens/around/roofing/underlayment.asp

Note the two types - granule surface vs. smooth.  I'm not surprised that
you find it difficult to find in Dallas, since ice dams are not a big
problem in Texas and, from my recollection, asphalt shingles are not as
common down there.  But the smooth underlayment might be occasionally
used in roof valleys.  Scan your yellow pages or other directories for
Owens-Corning distributors in Texas - someone just might have it.
