&gt; OK, I couldn't resist.

&gt; I bought my 71' Dead Westy from my Nephew, who inherited it from his buddy.
&gt; They used to tour the West Coast and I have two Dead decals.

&gt; least - a very  old, tin film canister. Who ever remembers tin film
&gt; canisters is dating themselves, but they made great air and water tight
&gt; containers. I thought I had struck the mother lode when I shook it -
&gt; something was in there! When I opened it and poured - out came rust!

OK, I'm dating myself...on my 78 bus I have removed the stock heat system
and rely solely on the gas heater...well that left a hole in the engine
compartment tin about 3 inches in diameter on the left side..???  hm, I
bulk load my film and had a canister from the some film,  rolled over the
top and bottom a few times and had two matching flat round pieces of
steel, painted black and a couple bolts and I have a perfect patch to
close the hole...and it remains stock just by unbolting it and putting the
heat tube back in..guess that now qualifies me as a DPO
