Subject: Re: [T2] Anybody Have These?

I was told those two pieces keep the air flowing towards the back of the bus
when moving.  The air is pushed around it seems very very well
thoughtout-like.
If it was simply stone guard stuff, it wouldn't leave the gap at the back..
at the front
its tight up. Just my two cents..

&gt; &gt; I need the two lower cooling tins that go between the heater boxes and
the
&gt; case for a '73 1700.
&gt;
&gt; I don't believe these are critical for cooling. The cooling tins go above
&gt; the pushrod tubes. The tins between the case and heater box are only stone
&gt; guards to prevent damage to the pushrod tubes.
