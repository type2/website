Subject: Highway Mileage Study

This was cross posted to the Bugpack list and the Touareg forum at VW
Vortex.  But I think it will be of interest to all -- Joe

I did a mileage study with my Touareg V8 last week.  

Summary of results on Pennsylvania Turnpike from Monroeville/Pittsburgh to
Downingtown/Philadelphia:
1.  Normal highway mileage  _at_ 75mph target speed:
17mpg
2.  Steady-state throttle to produce 65mph on level straightaway*:
28mpg
3.  Cruise-controlled _at_ 65mph:					22mpg

Holding the throttle steady produces a 60% improvement in gas mileage over
maintaining speed over rolling hill terrain.  A lower target speed also
improves mileage but not so much.

* the steady-state throttle meant the beastly Treg crawled up the bigger
hills at a mere 35 or 40mph -- just as in my 1978 Camper w/3 speed auto!
