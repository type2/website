Subject: First Engine Pull : Day 2

Hey there sports fans...

Well, Saturday I dropped my first engine and stuck it in the garage.
Sunday afternoon, I went back out to look at it again, yep still
there.  Sunday I &quot;tore&quot; it down a bit.  First came off the remaining
tin, placed into a pile of tin to be cleaned (It'll take me a week to
get the tin cleaned:).  Then the heads were the next candidate.  

I removed the rocker arm pieces, keeping them on the shaft using wire
to keep the ends in place so they don't come apart until I am ready
for them.  Labeled them and placed them to the side.  

The bolts holding the heads to the rest came off.  I then tried
removing the push rod tubes, NO GO AT ALL.  Using the vice grips I was
able to get them to spin but after eons of trying to remove them before
removing the heads (and destroying 3 tubes), I pulled the heads off
with the (remaining five) tubes still attached to the heads.  I then
used a rubber mallet to pop the tubes out.  Should they be that stuck?

The pistons and cylinders I am still unsure about.  The pistons had
lots of carbon on the tops, but the cylinders looked fine, except at
the top of the cylinder head side there was a dark ban.  Seemed
uniform among all four cylinders.  

Then the case and cylinders got a hose bath and scrubbing.  Wire
brush, some dish washing soap and lots of sweat.  Not spotless by a
long shot, but a little cleaner.  I then wheeled it back into the
garage and put it in between two fans.

Water got inside the crank case, and inside the cylinders and such.
Should I be worried?

Not too much on day two I guess, but it sure took a long time.  It
takes as long as it takes I guess.


take care,
        brandy
