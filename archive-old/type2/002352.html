I've noticed that a lot of you are from the Seattle / Tacoma area.  When I
lived up there, there was a VW shop in Federal Way called Oval's - at the
west end of Highway 18 past the Weyerheauser campus.  If it still exists, do
any of you shop there?

The reason I ask: they used to sell a great little oval shaped sticker.  It
was white with black lettering, had the VW logo on the left hand side, and
had written 'It's not a car - it's a bus!'  If they still sell these, I
would gladly pay someone to pick up a couple for me.  I have not seen these
anyere else since then.
