Subject: Re: [T2] crossover pipe compat?

Hey, Steve, the same system is on our 78 Westy as on the 75 bus I'm
fixing up- here's a pic showing both (will send to interested listees
via e-mail), as well as Bus Depot's version, which I am sending back if
they can find the same replacement, which fits under the heat shield on
my 78.  It's always had this non-crossover pipe system, for at least the
last 2 muffler changes....but since I got the bus at 60K mi, I can't
remember if I tossed a crossover pipe when I changed heat exchangers-
but I remember always the triangular flange heat exchangers.

&gt; &gt;From '72-75, the muffler connects directly to the heater boxes.  If you
&gt; *have* a crossover pipe on your bus, then it is possible that you have the
&gt; '76-78 exhaust and if that is true, then the '76-78 crossover pipe will
&gt; (of course) fit.
