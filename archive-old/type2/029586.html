&gt; &gt; Volks,
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  I just got my JC Whitney catalog, and amongst the yummies, I spotted a 
&gt; &gt;  metrinch tool set. Searched the library and the archives with no real 
&gt; hits. 
&gt; &gt;  Anyone care to give me a &quot;road test impression&quot; on these?
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  For the price, I expect that I could buy both metric and inch sets, but 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt;  savings in weight and space (for the metrinch)is appealing.

As someone who has never had a set of inch tools, I've found that my
metric set is pretty good for working on my C*evy.  Most inch sizes are a
pretty close match for some metric size if you have a full set (increments
of 1mm).  There are a couple of sizes you need inch wrenches for, but not
many.
