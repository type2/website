&gt;runs reasonably well at idle, but it backfires (very small) and 
&gt;then races....no pattern of any kind

You've probably already checked, but it would be worth checking for intake 
leaks where your runners bolt to the heads and around the 4 rubber tubes that 
connect your runners to your plenum.  I prefer carb cleaner for this test and 
much prefer to do this on a cold engine.  Just squirt a bit of carb cleaner 
around the base gaskets or rubber tubes with the engine running.  If the idle 
speeds up, there's a leak.
