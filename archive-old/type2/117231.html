Subject: re: crimpers

here is a nice set, these are not mine and i'm not selling them but i saw
them on ebay.

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=3020803423&amp;category=28026

and this one looks good but i have no experience with the brand

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=2528239062&amp;category=7285

one of these days i'm going to spend the money on a good set of amp
crimpers like we use here at work but for now i'm just using the heavy
plier type which are no where near as good as the ratchet type but a world
better than the cheap ones you get in the terminal kits, i won't even use
those to strip wire with.  sorry for posting e..y auctions but i think this
will fly due to them not being mine and me not profiting by the exposure.

some direct bus content.  i finally found the fabric that is in my price
range and the wife likes after about 3 months of searching so i bought 20
yards which will be more than enough to do what i need to do.  it is a
hawaiian fabric w/ surf boards and turtles for 3.50 a yard in the colors we
like so it looks like the entire outside of the bus will be teal and white
armacoating, can't wait and hopefully i'll at least have the outside and
curtains done for the vw classic.
