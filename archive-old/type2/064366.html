Subject: follow-up: ignition relay led to ugly breakdown.

Greetings, all:

Several listers offered advice for my sudden troubles with ignition: 
Almost all pointed to the voltage drop and the relay fix.  So today I
bought the Bosch WR-1 kit and put it in.  Directions were clear, didn't
have any problems.  Cable-tied the wires out of the way, reconnected the
battery, and fired it up--and it started just fine, though it was a warm
day and a cool engine, so that wasn't really a test.  I drove it around
the neighborhood for a couple of miles, starting and stopping.  All seemed
well.  Came out after supper and it still started fine.  

But after about 15 minutes on the road, cruising along at about 30mph
through narrow, near-downtown streets, it suddenly died deader than a
mackerel.  I tried popping the clutch in second while it was still
coasting, but that didn't work, so I coasted through the intersection to a
stop, then tried to start it. At first it would crank and seem almost to
catch, but that ended after two or three tries, and then it wouldn't even
crank, or click.  Lights and radio worked. 

If I ever meet any of you folks over a beer, I'll tell you in detail the
story of what happened next [&quot;okay, this salt shaker is my bus, and these
honey roasted nuts are all the jerks who drove *over* my flares without
getting out of my lane, almost rear-ending me, and this french fry is the
friendly cop who finally just parked his car in my lane about 10 car
lengths back so they'd all *have* to pull into the other lane, and waited
with me until I got a tow organized...&quot;]. 

But for now--without twenty-seven 8x10 color glossies with circles and
arrows on the front and a paragraph on the back explaining what each one
was--the story is that, after a hair-raising tow up into the West Hills of
Portland, the bus is parked and I'm going to deal with it in the morning. 

I wouldn't risk my life to check underneath while it was stuck in traffic,
and it's now parked on the street so I can't really look at it tonight,
even if I were in the mood--and, with the best will in the world, I have
to say honestly that I'm not. 

So, any advice on what I should be looking at first when I go out there
tomorrow morning?  I'll go over the relay wiring first for gross problems; 
but after that...? Thanks in advance. 

Hoping for the best,
Bill

p.s.  As I stood there and chatted with the city cop, I couldn't shake all
the recent stories on the list about probable cause.  I have no Dead
stickers on the bus [at the moment], and the closest I had to contraband
was some tomatoes from a friend's garden, and the cop was pretty okay, but
it still made me feel just a little . . .
