Subject: GL5 What Now?

Volks,

It appears that I unknowingly filled my transmission with Amalie GL5.

I have driven the van 2 summers for approximately 3000 - 4000 miles.

Does the GL5 cause weakness in the metal, something like metal fatigue? OR

Does it just cause premature wear, due to improper lubrication?

Am I safe in just draining it and adding GL4 Hypoid Gear Oil?

Wish I had known earlier.

Matt

The transmission works fine, at this time. So I do not believe there is any
damage thus far. Or at least minimal.
