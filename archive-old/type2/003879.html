&gt;First comes to mind is a governor to prevent over-rev.  Either it be a

&gt;I'm going with dual carbs.  Electronic ones that work with the distributor
&gt;seemed best choice, and I'm going to experiment with one.  I'm curious if
&gt;anyone has gone this route... the one I have looked at should work with any
&gt;type of dizzy, and it just cuts out points trigger until RPM drops back to
&gt;set level.  So far, I've only found such devices intended for racing and
&gt;they aren't cheap.  Anyone know of such a device for under $100?


You can buy the Bosch RPM Limiter Rotors for about $25.  You can choose the
cut out point at 5400, 5800, 6500, 6800, etc.  They are just a replacement
rotor that works on centrifugal force to open to contacts once a certain RPM
has been reached.  You can get 'em from the mail order houses.  Some of the
parts guys on the list might even have them.

The one thing I worry about most when lending out my bus is that someone
might lug the engine.  I have nightmares about that one!  So I don't lend my
bus out very often.  I'm not selfish, I just like my bus.

Later,
