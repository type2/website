&lt;&lt;  I would agree that if you
want significant improvements you need to get a little
deeper into the engine.:-) But from what I have seen
a chip change can make a difference. I know a couple

high 11's (Waterwagens/Seattle) and they are not
running stock chips.

FWIW, Erick Aguilar's Honda Civic did the quarter 
in 10 : 28 at 128 MPH...On gas with no turbo...
Obviously, lots of work &quot;deeper&quot; in the engine,
but the electronics were a large part...
