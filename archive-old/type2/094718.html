Subject: engine pull



&gt; In the Idiot book =
&gt; Muir suggests simply rolling the bus away from the engine (and back =
&gt; toward for installation) but I'm not sure how you can accomplish this =
&gt; with the transmission hanging down at an angle. =20

Hal,

Muir was writing in the time of fixing splits that have the tranny bolted in
like in a bug.  For a '70 bus, a plastic milk crate is almost the perfect
height to support the tranny, sometimes with a short piece of 2x4.

&gt; Second, the moustache bar that supports the rear of the engine was in =
&gt; the way when trying to reinstall the engine.  Do people remove this and =
&gt; the muffler before removing or instaling the engine or do most people =
&gt; just keep it all attached and work around it. =20

I leave them on. If you maneuver it right, the bar is not in the way.

&gt; Last, I drained the oil and did added new oil after I was all done.  Now =
&gt; the Drain Bolt seems to leak.  Am I supposed to use a new washer each =
&gt; time?=20

Yes.
