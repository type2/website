Yipes !!
Well, on the other hand, I did drive Casper out across the Mojave last 
year under 100 ++ temps.
The flaps were wired open all the way, and I did not encounter any 
adverse temp problems.
Upon doing the engine rebuild last September, I took them out.
I still do not encounter temp problems, and it has been quite hot here 
this Summer.
102 F today, as an example.

Others???
Are the flaps needed to direct air to the oil cooler???
I wasn't able to see that they directed air to the oil cooler in my 
analysis at the time I decided to remove them.
Was I wrong in my conclusion???
