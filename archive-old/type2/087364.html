Subject: Middle seats

Hi volks,

I just bought a 71 sunroof bus, and it came with two of the 2/3 
middle seats.  They are different, and I was wondering which is 
correct for the 71 bus.

Seat #1 has  the passenger side armrest bar coming from the front of 
the seat.  This seat also appears to have popouts for headrests.

Seat #2 has the passenger side armrest coming from the reat of the 
seat, and this seat does not appear to have any provision for 
headrests.

Any idea which (if either) is correct.  I can post pictures if my 
lame description is inadequate.
