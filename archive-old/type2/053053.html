Hi All

I don't get it. My 71 Westy shifts through the gears just fine - as long as
the engine
is turned off. Standing still and idling, I can barely find any gear. I can
get it into
reverse but a grind is very audible. When I do find a gear and get it
moving, can't
find any gear when trying to downshift.
Clutch feels good with normal pedal position when it engages.
Shifting &quot;knuckle&quot; under the shift arm is a few months old.
Shifting has been mushy since I got the bus but thought it was one of
those VW  &quot;features.&quot;

Looking to the list for a solution - and hope its a simple one too.

Thanks,

Pete
