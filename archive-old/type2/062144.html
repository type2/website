Subject: Re: FI and Distributors questions 76 vs 79

&gt;   I've heard a lot about the second set of points that the FI computer
&gt;  uses for timing. My distributor doesn't seem to have these, or any 
My understanding is that the computer used a second set of points in the 
old Electronic Fuel Injection, not the AFC (like in 76).
&gt; If the FI uses the ignition points, how does it know which injector
&gt; to fire?
&gt; 
If I read the Bentley right, it fires ALL injectors every other firing of 
the coil.  Doesn't make sense to me, either.
