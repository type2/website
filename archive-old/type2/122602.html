Subject: hours beyond frontispiece

updating the triumph of 69. the engine came out yesterday in my first solo
removal, w/o manual.  a crystal clear sixty-five degree day. carport empty;
just tools and engine. old and new dylan playing out the screen window -
spring surely arrived.

got up at 3am in line with frontispiece. bummer it wasn't sixty-five at four
in the morning. (mother-in-law surprise visits the bus for the first time
and just left wondering. list, am i &quot;typical eugene&quot;? nobody home but me and
three vw buses. maybe two was safer)  okay, straight to the point:  the
seized engine found in the bus has the heads off. both are GEX with no
carbon, clean, no cracks. one valve looks to be chipped on the underside of
the face, i hope that's what it's called, the flat part the valve can stand
on.

hunch:  a chip may have froze the engine?
q: after valve replacement would you put the cylinder heads on?
          they're so clean they don't hardly need a touch up.
q: valve guides with these seemingly new rebuilt heads, leave them alone?
          did i say they were GEX? how many times does a head go through as
core? - steve
