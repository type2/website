&lt;&lt; Hello Guys  Isn't that the bus that was at that crazy  FBI screw up in 
Waco 
 Texas A few years ago. Or better yet is it Dr. Krovican&quot;s (SP)  death bus, &gt;&gt;

Its really amusing how oddballs like Dr. Kevorkian, wacko's like Waco's David 
Koresh and movie producers like the ones that did &quot;Back to the Future&quot; manage 
to besmirtch and despoil the reputation of our dear buses!

Oh well, we still seem get smiles from the general populace despite the 
negative associations.
