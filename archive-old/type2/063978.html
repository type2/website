Well Texas isn't invisible, but if you measured the state by the number of
trees, the state would be the size of Rhode Island.  (How far is it from Dallas
to San Antonio???  Three six packs)  Big Bend National Park is great but not
really on the way from Az to La.    I've driven across Texas every which way and
there sure is a whole lot of (seems to me) nothing out there.  Now I have family
from Texas, friends in Texas, and Texans have been very very good to me on the
whole  from time to time.  But I can't remember much scenic wonder unless you
are really into big dry open spaces....John Jensen in Annapolis.
