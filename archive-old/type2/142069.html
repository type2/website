Subject: Asbestos in Heat Exchangers, etc. was: [T2] Heat Exchanger
  Quality

Back in 1996-1997 or so, VW of America was replacing heat exchangers, etc. 
in old Bay Window buses, at no charge. They sent a VWoA representative from 
Dallas to my local garage, who, with my help, replaced the heat exchangers, 
accordian tubes and flapper boxes on my '79 bus, all at no cost. They used 
Danish heater parts. The old heat exchangers and flapper boxes had, indeed, 
been wrapped in asbestos; the old accorian tubes incorporated an internal 
layer of asbestos in their design. The new parts contained no asbestos; the 
heat exchangers and flapper boxes were not wrapped with anything.

VW wouldn't officially use the &quot;A-word&quot; in any communications with me, but 
the VW rep who installed these parts told me confidentially that yes, their 
legal department had ordered this program to limit their liability somehow 
by demonstrating that they cared and were proactive about the asbestos 
issue, etc. A VW rep asked me on the phone when I was thinking about buying 
a new VW. I told her maybe in another 17 years, as the one I was driving was 
not even halfway worn out yet. I'm sure that she was shaking her head.

Hey Terry,
      Yeah, sounds like a great idea, just wrap the HEs.  Years ago I 
scrapped
a Type 2 for body rust reasons; the Chicago owner had covered the HEs with a
kind of asbestos blanketing.  Seemed a great concept, except (human safety
considerations apart) the asbestos absorbed the water loaded with road salt,
and the HEs were toast, to say it with a  bit of humor ;-))

&lt;&lt; heat is robbed from the outside of the H.E. by air passing under the
bus.&gt;&gt;

Right... And a real simple solution to this phenomena would be to wrap them 
up
to keep them insulated to retain the heat.
