&gt;OK, I'll bite!  How often will a 90A (or even 45A) alternator truly see

&gt;electrically I don't see any way to use this much power.  Unless you plan
&gt;on installing a pirate radio station and driving it around the country I
&gt;doubt that you'll use the amps!

&gt;The real reason for high capacity alternators is to ensure rapid recharge
&gt;of the battery on vehicles that get a lot of short trips (fire, ambulance,
&gt;military) and tend to have a number of accessories that draw power while
&gt;the engine is off.
&gt;

That's one reason, but what if demand exceeds supply?

You forgot to add up the wizbang. He had problems with a worn out gen and
batteries after adding a big bad stereo/multiCD and a coupla other more
than modest draw items. Whether 90 amps would be adequate to provide total
demand with lights and heater and bone crushing volume is unknown, but I
have seen a number of these multi thousand dollar stereos with extra amps
and concrete fracturing sub bass that had 140 amp and larger custom
alturnators. How much draw is needed for 8 massive magnets at full
fazers??? I saw a stereo shop show car 10 years ago that had over $10,000
in 1990 money with TWO big alturnators mounted. 

Peoples values vary, fer sur. Volume costs money, how loud must you have
it? It can provide the benefit of clean wheel wells at all times. I can't
recall ever seeing one of these boomers go by without something rattling to
the beat. If you program the tunes that harmonize with the door panels,
hey, let's get sureal.
