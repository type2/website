Subject: Re: Can a solenoid be swapped w/o removing starter? ('80)
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt;&gt;As for removing the solenoid from the starter, it *can* be done without an
&gt;&gt;impact screwdriver (ask me how I know), but do yourself a favour and get
&gt;&gt;one if you don't have one already.  The screws are really bejesus tight.
&gt;
&gt;
I think Sean and Tobin are both being quite optimistic, I've had starters
that I couldn't liberate the solenoid from using impact and heat (acetylene
mind you, not the whussy stuff).  Still it is typically the solenoid that
goes in the &quot;no start&quot; syndrome, if you are getting progressively worse,
have to bang it to work, etc, you can save some money, a way to even save
more assuming you haven't yet burnt the solenoid up, IF you can get it
apart, take the plunger out and polish the solenoid bore and plunger with
WD40 and 220-320 grit silicon carbide paper, clean it all up, apply an ever
so thin wiping of moly grease or dry moly if you got it, reassemble and it
will probably work for years, BUT I'm lucky to get 50% of the ones I try to
repair even apart in the damp salted rust belt.  You may want to clean the
electrical contacts inside the solenoid as well while you are at it, and
apply a little grease on them.
