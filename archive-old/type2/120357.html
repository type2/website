&gt; &gt; Hello Jamie    It shorted out. I would change over to an Alt. at this time
&gt; &gt; Bosch number Al82N  brand new  Cost me $110.00 but does come with internal
&gt; &gt; regulator and is brand new. You willl also have to chage the stand.

&gt; If you are currently running a 38 amp generator, then you will also need to
&gt; replace the backing plates.

As well as the fan hub!  The 38A is different from the 30A/alternator
hub!
