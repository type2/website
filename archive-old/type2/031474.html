&gt; I agree with your idea of keeping it easy to grab.  In

problem is most spreadsheet versions do not download worth beans in
&quot;text&quot; format, and most of the new palm software uses text transfer..such
as PINE.

&gt; a state it would be sorted by city, and have the
&gt; essential information like name, email, phone, and
&gt; crossroads pop up fast.  I've got it for North
&gt; Carolina, but it took a couple hours to cut and paste
&gt; the AIRS info into a spreadsheet.  If someone could
&gt; figure out how to splice these &quot;cell phone lists&quot; from
&gt; each state onto the web site, maybe volunteers could
&gt; do their states and send them in.
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, I like spreadsheets because they seem much
&gt; simpler to me than data bases.  Being simpler, I think
&gt; they would be easier for most of us to handle and
&gt; update.  On the other hand, data base experts I'm sure
&gt; would want to do this with a data base.

&gt; &gt; don't make the list so &quot;Fancy&quot; that you can't grab

&gt; &gt; such as you might have to use out on the road.
