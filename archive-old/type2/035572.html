Subject: Re: Dist./Motor ID Q's  (and answers!!!)

i too have two of the 411/412 engines.  the following numbers, etc. are from
my 411/412 haynes manual.  not the best book, but does show some differences
between them and the type iv bus motor.

engine codes:
V and Z - carb'd engines
W       - fuel infection
EA or EB- &quot;      &quot;     with emossion control

EA engines were also used in the porsche 914.  and not to get into a huge
discussion about that but you can tell if it is a 914 longblock if it has 3
bolt intakes (914) or 4-bolt intakes (bus/411).

distributors:

series--------dist. suffix--------code---------date of use

bosch 
021 905 205       ---              V           12/8/68-11/8/69
                   A*              V           12/8/69-11/8/72
                   B         V automatic       12/8/68-11/8/69
                   C*        Z      &quot;          12/8/69-11/8/72
                   L         Z      &quot;          12/8/72- on
                   K               Z             &quot;     &quot;
                   
022 905 205        A*              W           12/8/69-11/8/72
                   P.Q*          EA.EB         12/8/72- on

* fitted with dual vacuum control


static timing---5 degrees BTDC (black mark on fan)

stobe timing----
carb        ----32 BTDC _at_ 3500rpm (red mark on fan)
fuel inj.   ----27 BTDC _at_ 3500rpm (red mark on fan)

compression ratio!!!!! IMPORTANT!!!!!!

carbs---------------------------------------7.8:1
fuel inj.-----------------------------------8.2:1

EB (california w/ recessed crown pistons)---7.3:1 

also note :   IMPORTANT!!!!------------------

when doing a compression test on your 411/412 motor (may also apply to bus
owners) there is a difference betwwen compression pressure normal, and
compression pressure (turned by started).

the book states:
comp. normal-----------------------------114 to 142 psi
comp. (engine warm turned by starter-----100 psi minimum


also with a 411/412 engine going into a bus you have to put in a electric
fuel pump.  be careful you most likely will have WAY WAY WAY to much fuel
pressure.  so make a note and buy a regulator.

also the carbs were different but thats a WHOLE 'nother story!!

hope this helps.

The
&gt;  engine number (EA092288) leads me to believe it originally came from a
&gt;  '71 or '72 Type 4.  Is this correct?   I've also located a couple of dual
vacuum
&gt;  distributors, but don't know if they'll do me any good.  One has
&gt;  D412-81-106A stamped on the side, the other has 113-095-205AN.
