Subject: [T2] Aux Battery Setup

I recently ordered one of the battery relays from Bus Depot, this past
weekend at Oktoberbus I was able to hook it up (with the help of Dave
Jersey and Snoopy).  As best I can tell, it works as advertised.
However, I now realize it does not do exactly what I had in mind.

The relay isolates the second battery so it won't draw off of the main
battery.  I also assumed that it ( I didn't reason it out) that it would
cause the various systems in the bus (radio, lights, etc.) to be powered
off the aux battery.  Not so, anything intended to be powered by the aux
battery (ignition off or on) must be wired directly to it.  You might
have a dedicated camping light, fan, or 12v access. outlet hooked to it,
but these items should not be used while the engine is running.  I
believe the primary purpose of the relay is to charge a battery used to
power an accessory like a refrigerator.

What I had in mind is something like the setup on my sailboat, two
batteries with a selector switch which allows power to be drawn off of
either or both, and keeps both charged.  I don't necessarily need the
ability to select which one, using the aux battery only while camping
would be fine, leaving the main battery ready for engine cranking.

I want to be able to use the bus stereo (not there yet) and interior
lights while camping without running down the starting battery.
Creating a second electrical system off the aux battery, which wouldn't
allow the use of anything wired into it while underway, doesn't fit with
what I wanted.

After lengthy discussion at Oktoberbus, I came up with the following
scheme.  I'm posting it here before I actually try it, in case I'm
risking bus and/or limb.  Please tell me if/why this would/could not
work:

This is for my '68 Adventurewagen

Leave the relay installed as is.  Then run a substantial power lead off
the aux battery to a two position switch installed between the ignition
switch and the fuse box.  The switch would be A/B, one for power coming
off the ignition switch (normal driving) and one for power coming of the
aux battery (camping position).

What would happen if the ignition key was turned and the switch was set
to the aux power?  Would the coil receive power (activating the relay)
and would the starter turn?  Would I risk blowing out wiring?
Prevailing opinion at Oktoberbus was no.

Assuming that something bad would happen if the ignition key was turned
while the aux battery was selected, would I be ok with this setup if I
made sure not to ever turn the key with the selector switch in aux
position?

My thinking is that this would allow me to simply substitute the power
source for the fuse panel and thus the wiring for the interior lights
and stereo, allowing their use both while driving and camping.  Am I
(horribly and tragically) wrong?  Enlighten me o denizens of the list.

Thanks,
