&gt; I'm relatively new here.  I greatly appreciate any help.  I have a 70 Bus
with a 1600 Single Port engine with stock solex carb.  Recently, when I push
down the accelerator, the engine seemed to hesitate a little.  I tried to
clean the carb this past weekend and now the problem is even worse.  Its so
bad that I can hardly even get the bus moving.  I just read Robert Hoovers
article titled Cutting Out at Idle and Im going to look for vacuum leaks
tomorrow, but I know the timing, points, and plugs are ok.  Again, any
thoughts would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

what distributor is on this engine. if it's a 009 there is sometimes a
hesitation issue with this distributor. I would also check the
accelerator pump on the carb. without a shot of fuel when you push the
pedal, carbed engines will stumble untill the vacuum of the engine
pulls enough fuel in.
