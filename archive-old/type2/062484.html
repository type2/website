Two possible options for you, Bob:

1. buy an air tank and fill it at a service station. ($30+ ...and you'll
need the right kind of hose and nozzle.)

2. go to the electronics/computer section of a local gadget store and buy
a small can of compressed air for $2-3.

Have fun! Joe

&gt; I'm in a quandry about rebuilding my carb. It's not the building that

&gt; blow out all the passages with compressed air. Problem is, you guessed it, I 
&gt; have no air compressor. And I don't think it would be fiscally advisable to 
&gt; buy one to rebuild my carb. Any thoughts? Does anyone sell cans of 
&gt; compressed air?
