Subject: Found the Problem to my Accelerator Pedal

After going through the bus from underneath back to the engine, it appears
that the 34 Pict-3 adjustment segment ( See Bentley Manual p FIg. 5-27 page 23
part #31)  bolt was catching on the side of the alternator. (I put an
alternator on over 1 1/2 years ago and I had to trim a little off the side to
get it to fit) Well I got the dremel out and touched up where the bolt was
hitting. Now I push down on the Accelerator and it comes back , does't catch
anymore....

Now the question why would it catch now after all these months? That's a
bigger puzzle.... ideas?
