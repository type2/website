This happened to me last fall.
Checked the fuses - nothing
checked the wires - nothing
took out one of the lights - no power at the wire connection

Turned out to be the relay under the fuse box.
Apparently, I had hit it at some previous time or it just jiggled loose

Disconnected it, cleaned the contacts, reconnected
Voila!
lights came back on

Good luck
michael
