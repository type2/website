Subject: Air distribution box/throttle body manifold gasket follow-up 

Gentlevolk,

Back on Fri, 5 Sep 2003, Richard Atwell &lt;ratwell_at_xxxxxxx&gt; wrote:

&gt; &gt; The 022 133 073A gasket has been NLA from the VW dealer for a long
&gt; &gt; time.

And I responded:

&gt; True, alas.

Richard further spake:

&gt; &gt; What is still available is the late Vanagon gasket, 025 133 073A. It
&gt; &gt; looks very similar in size and shape with the only differences I can
&gt; &gt; see being that it has more ribs along the circumference and there 3
&gt; &gt; small cutouts at the perimeter are missing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Has anyone tried using this gasket? There's a lot in stock still and
&gt; &gt; the rubber is like new.

And I said:

&gt; Richard,

&gt; I have used 3-4 of these in different bay and vanagon applications.
&gt; It is the gasket I was referring to in my post.  As far as I can tell,
&gt; the slope and diameter of the cone on both the air distribution box
&gt; and the throttle body appears to me never to have changed, even on the
&gt; digifont engines. I'd love to have one next to a NOS Bay gasket, but I
&gt; doubt you would find one :-(


Well.... by way of follow-up, today, since I wasn't doing anything but
being &quot;the chainsaw fairy&quot;[1], I stopped by a VW dealership and ordered
the gasket.  When I asked about the gasket for a '78 bus, it was listed as
NLA.  When I asked for the gasket for an '82 bus (same air dist box, same
throttle body casting) they had one listed for $4.  It was special order,
but it *was* listed.  I did order one. I did not get the part number, but
the new gasket will be in Tuesday and I will report the gasket part number
and comparability to an old gasket I dug out of the parts stash[2].

[1] The chainsaw fair comes around the day after a hurricane with his/her
chainsaw and cuts up the trees that the storm has felled.  The chainsaw
contractor charges $100-1000 depending on your desperation level.  The
chainsaw fairy cuts up the tree without asking anything, unamerican
sociallist that he is :-)  Three people got a visit from the chainsaw
fairy today... more tomorrow!

[2]  One of these days, as I get closer to moving, I have *got* to
disperse this stash.  Mostly it is &quot;good used&quot; stuff I have pulled and
saved, but the limit is that I *WILL NOT* ship.  The price will be free,
but you are going to hav to (a) pick it up or (b) talk a DC-area listee
inot picking it up to ship to you.  Sorry, but I am bad at UPS at the best
of times, right now it is just out of the question.
