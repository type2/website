I've read on a couple of lists about the hesitation that the 009 dist gives 
you on take off. The 72 bus I just got and had tuned up by a 30+ year veteran 
of VWs, has this hesitation. It also has the aftermarket Weber progressive 
2brl carb. Does anyone have a better setup for this engine or know what the 
original dist should be? Also, could it be used with the weber setup. Im 
also thinking about going to the electronic setup, but would this be ok in 
the 009 or better to go with the orginal dist. The mechanic also said that 
some of the webers he has seen is the cause of this hesitation and some run 
like a champ. Has anyone ever tried several webers and had this problem with 
one and not the other ?

-----------------------------------------

The April addition of WV trends has a good article on distributors. 

It states that when the carb is changed from stock the vacuum signal to the 
vacuum advance distributor is altered and therefore cannot be relied upon to 
give you the proper advance.  Sounds reasonable.  But I've read all the 
cautions about the 009 not having enough advance at top end.   

I would like to hear from some of the more experienced mechanics on the list 
about this since I'm currently running the same setup as you.  What is the 
recommended distributor to run with a 1700 engine w/progressive weber 
conversion?  What would be the proper static timing setting?
