For those of you that have read the book &quot;Blue Highways&quot; you will appreciate this little report.  

It just so happens that I live near Conyers, Georgia.  In the book, it is mentioned on page 78 I believe.  Least Heat-Moon talks about visiting the Monastary of the Holy Spirit, well today I went to that monastary.  I sat and spoke with Father Anthony Delsi (also mentioned) and ironically enough he invited me to vespers.  Although he didn't ask me could I sing, I was a voice major in college, so I could have taken him up on the offer.

This man was an amazing being, he has been a monk for 30 years.  He is peaceful, yet full of life.  He displayed the most easy of humor, more in his eyes than in his laughter.  

I also have a report on Father Patrick Duffy, his picture is in the book, he has lost one of his lungs, and his bladder due to his abuse of alcohol prior to becoming a monk.  He is in the southwest serving in his duties.

For any of you traveling south by southeast, the book describes it as accurately as any laymen could describe it.  The one thing you notice first is the silence and peaceful nature that surrounds you.

Visit if you can.

I know this is not VW stuff, but maybe some can appreciate it's content.
