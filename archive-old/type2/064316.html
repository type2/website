Subject: MUST SELL '77 BUS

We have to sell our '77 Bus soon!  We are moving to Colorado and we have
too many VW's.  The body and interior are in very good condition, but
the engine leaks a lot of oil.  We wanted about $800, but we will sell
for less.  Please contact us if you are interested.  We are presently in
Augusta, Georgia.  Call us at 706-736-1109.
