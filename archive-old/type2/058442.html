To the List,

BBTA #14 trip report.

This would be my third BBTA event to attend.  The first was in '94 when
they &quot;let&quot; me camp with them in my N*ss*n S*ntr*.  I at least owned a
bus, but it was far from road worthy.  The second was in '96, the first
trip in my  '69 kombi.  It only had 500 miles on a freshly rebuilt
engine.  This year, '98, I had 5,000 miles on the same engine.  I spent
many nights and weekends getting everything ready for the trip.  I
visited with Josh Rodgers to see if he was also going to go.  He was,
and suggested that we caravan along with his friend Chad.  We decided to
travel at night due to Josh having an engine that appeared to be running
a little hot.  Sounded like a good idea with temperatures in the 100's
during the day.  Night driving was also easier on the  people as well
;-)

Josh and Chad, along with wife and girlfriend, were to arrive from Ponca
City at my house in Bartlesville about 7:00.  Karen and I were
frantically trying to get everything loaded in the bus and finish making
curtains.  Josh called to say that it would be at least 9:00 before they
got to my house.  What a relief, as we weren't ready either.  Later Josh
called again and said that it would still be later.  I said fine, I'm
taking a nap.  Call when you get about 30 minutes away.  I was able to
sneak in a 90 minute nap before he called again.

Josh and Rachel, Chad and Lori showed up at my house about 11:40.  After
a quick look at my '72 camper project and potty break, we departed.
First stop was to gas up so that we all had full tanks.  Josh set the
pace so that he could monitor his engine temps and drive accordingly.
We left Bartlesville at 12:25 A.M. Friday morning.  The night sort of
runs together after this, but I drove for about 200 miles while Karen
slept in the back.  The other ladies did the same.  We had CBs which
helped pass the time since you couldn't see anything in the dark of
night.  We managed to drive about 60-65.  Finally, I was too tired to
drive anymore so I woke Karen up and told her it was her turn.

Now is time for a personal confession.  I am the world's worst
passenger.  I mean I can be a nervous wreck when someone else drives.
It doesn't matter who they are.  Karen knows this and (hopefully)
doesn't take it personally.  Karen can drive anything.  She is quite
capable and has been paying attention to how busses are driven, i.e. no
lugging the engine, what rpm to cruise at, etc.  So after the driver
change,  I helped her get familiar with the CB and such and then I
crawled in back to sack out.  I slept for about 45 min. to an hour.
Karen continued to drive all the way to O'Fallen.

When we arrived at camp, about 10:30 Friday morning, the first person to
greet us was the illustrious Charlie Ford.  Now when I read Charlie's
&quot;ramblings&quot; I will hear it in his deep southern voice.  We eventually
chose a camp site close to Charlie and the Mother Ship.  We were
actually surprised at how many busses were already there.  We set up
some of the gear and napped for a while.  It was HOT, but we were in a
shady place so that helped.

I didn't get to meet as many people as I would have liked.  Maybe it was
the heat or the mosquitoes at night!  Anyway I'll not go into too much
detail about the actual event as others can do more justice to it than
I.  Needless to say, I enjoyed looking at all the busses (always looking
for new things to incorporate into my busses) and meeting fellow
campers.  The Wisconsin group sure know how to party!  I admire their
spirit and energy.  Anyone who takes that much stuff along has really
got to have an abundance of energy!

Karen and I elected to skip the caravan and wait for Josh and Chad to
return so we could go to the Riverboat casino.  This was a first for
Karen and I.  I left a few $ there.  We went in search of a place to eat
dinner and on the way met a fellow who had a camper to sell.  We took
the information down and gave it to Bill Bowman.  Hopefully he can find
a new home for it.  Any luck Bill?  After dinner we went to Wall Mart so
I could get a fan.  This was something that I always intended to do, but
after I had a dual battery set up.  I word of advice for you that don't
have fans, get one!  It will not drain a healthy battery for days.  We
slept much better Saturday night and only needed the fan for two or
three hours.

Sunday Karen and I left about noon.  Josh and Chad were going to go
later.  To our surprise we met up with them in Herman, MO after we had
finished our picnic lunch.  Again going our separate ways, Karen and I
stopped for the night at Bennet Springs State Park just east of Lebanon,
MO.  This is a beautiful park with trout hatchery swimming pool and many
campsites.  We picked out a spot and I grilled some steaks.  It was much
cooler in the Park than it had been at BBTA.  We had a very comfortable
night and slept in Monday morning.  We checked out Stockton Lake on the
way back.  Had dinner in Joplin and made it back to Bartlesville 9:00
Monday evening.

The bus ran great the whole trip.  I have a Berg oil temp dipstick that
is supposed to turn on the oil light if the oil temp gets above 225-230
degrees.  It never came on!  Gas mileage is up with the dual Kadrons
(more on that in another post).

I was happy to meet so many people and make new friends (Pete from
Tulsa).  Unfortunately I cannot remember all their names and this post
is getting too long already.  I just love making those road trips!

Keep on bussin'
