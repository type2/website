I tried to straighten my rear bumper, spent an hour banging the heck out of it with a 5 pound hammer.  (Lucky for me I had no neighbors).  I even chained it to a tree and my jeep, and put a lot of pressure on it.  I did straighten it some, but it never looked right enough for me.  I eventually found a used one at a VW swap for about $30.

As for painting the top, use a good cleaning compound made for removing fungus from fiberglass.  I found some at a boat place, and it worked great.  I'm going to get mine painted next week with regular auto paint.  I asked another bus owner what he used, and he said just paint it with regular auto paint.

If this isn't the best way, then I too hope to get corrected here on this list. 

Cheers,
Mike
