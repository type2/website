&gt; It's a PITA if you don't know anything about them (FI) and can't get them

So is adjusting the carb, setting points, etc. I believe you're
letting others opinions influence your thoughts here. If you have the
bentley look through the FI section at the back. Almost everything can
be tested &amp;  declared good or bad. There is little guess work in the
FI world. Plus you can check it w/ common diagnostic tools.

&gt; The parts are more expensive and require
&gt; diagnostic equipment that I don't currently own.

More expensive is probably correct, there are more parts in the FI
system &amp; many are carried only by a few vendors. Here's the good part,
the diagnostic equipment isn't expensive. I would consider a good
diagnostic set to include:

pressure gauge for fi (local FLAPS has it for $35)
vacuum gauge
VOM
Test light (which you can eliminate w/ the VOM but it's nice)

As you can see, it's not a whole lot of stuff. Really the only thing
listed that is in addition to diagnostic tools you would need for any
engine (I didn't list them here) would be the pressure gauge that
measures higher pressures. You should have all the other thing anyway.

&gt; I don't know about the better gas mileage part. Theoretically, yes.. 
&gt; But the FI efficiency is
&gt; traded off then for a bigger engine, pushing more weight, in the case of a
&gt; full-Westy. Nicer, more powerful and efficient, yes.. 

Please don't knock us Type-4ers for this :) the FI only came on later
t4 engines, but the t4 was around before selling it w/ FI. You problem
seems to be more w/ the larger more complex t4 engine than the simpler
t1 engine. 

&gt; But still, not the
&gt; same for an original air-cooled fan, like me. I unapologetically love the
&gt; simplicity of the 1600 engine, and I am beginning to see the advantages of
&gt; traveling light, rather than having all that kitchen equipment with you,
&gt; everywhere you go..  Jan B

They both have their good &amp; bad points. Each to it's own, but the VW
FI system is a fantasticly simple system which is easy to troubleshoot
&amp; runs fantastic for years.
