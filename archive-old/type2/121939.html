Subject: RE: [T2] Friday bus sightings

If I'm not mistaken that part about having to have a bus to be a Buskatier
if false.
they may encourage you to have one but welcome the enthusiasm of VW's and
Camping in general.

I did miss the posting of her Bus landed on the cutting room floor, that
would explain why the bus in the move looked better then hers.

Oh well, I got to spend the day with a great lady and her family.
