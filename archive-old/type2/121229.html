Subject: Re: [T2] camshaft bearing

You can totally do it.  I rebuilt mine with the books and the list's 
help and it's running super sweet.  Take your time and pay attention to 
the important things like cleanliness, tolerances, and balancing, and 
you'll have a great running engine.

&gt; Anyone in Alberta / Saskatchewan who would like a friend forever
&gt; who would be willing to teach a newbie to tear a 1700 fi down?
&gt; 
&gt; Is this something I could do with all the books I have?
&gt; 
&gt; Im almost considering selling it before it busts and cutting my losses.
