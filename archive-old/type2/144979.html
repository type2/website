Subject: trip

Hey, guys.  Just wanted to let everyone know that I'm
going to be out of the country for a couple of weeks
and off of the list.  (Karl, you should be expecting a
package.)  I'm flying to Costa Rica Saturday to bring
a ship back to NY.  I'll keep my eyes peeled for
busses in the Islands we visit on the way back.  
Might see what parts selection I can find in the canal
zone.  Amazing selection and pricing on a whole lot of
stuff there.  But I've never checked into VW parts.
Wasn't high on my list the last time I was there. 
This'll be my third time through the canal.  Hugs and
kisses (not)....KR
