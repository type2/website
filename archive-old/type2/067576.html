&gt; I recently stripped lots of goodies off an '84 GL (which
&gt; had NO RUST... weirdest thing I ever saw here in SLC),
&gt; including (front) seats.  It's amazing that the seats off a van
&gt; made in 1985 will fit my September '80 Westy!  Also snagged
&gt; a new gas tank to replace my rusted-through one -- in this
&gt; case the filler tube had changed but the tank was IDENTICAL.
&gt; Amazing.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, the seats are pretty nice (although an armrest is
&gt; missing and another one is wiggly) but they're real dirty/
&gt; greasy.  How can I clean these things?  I'm sure Gojo
&gt; will take out the grease (Gojo is my secret weapon --
&gt; used it to clean my filthy block when I was rebuilding the
&gt; engine!).
&gt; 
&gt; Also, if you have any armrests laying around in your parts bus
&gt; let me know!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
