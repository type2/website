Subject: '82 Vanagon's loss of power??!?!

Greetings All,

        I currently own an '82 Vanagon. Driving the other day, I noticed
when in four gear, it didn't accelerate with very much power. The first
three gears seem normal enough, but once in four, it takes a certain amount
of time to 60mph(100km). I just had a complete tune up done on it as well as
new brakes. There seems to a pumping action when I press the gas. Any ideas
on what to look at?  Thanks,

                                Jason
