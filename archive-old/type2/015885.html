If anyone is reading my posts, they may be interested in what I have found
on bleeding lifters.
The new lifters are shipped with a very light oil inside, not sure what it
is ,maybe machine oil. I disassembled them and followed the Haynes method
of bleeding and asssembled them in a pan of oil with the aid of a press.
IMHO you must bleed them and I dont think that light oil should stay in
there either. 
 
Bye for now.  Leslie
