Hi Banny,

Yes, I did a similar trip with my T2 once. I did &quot;The
Netherlands-Paris-Nice-Monte Carlo-Pisa-Rome-Venice-Munich-The
Netherlands&quot;
during the summer of 1998. It was quite a trip but very nice.

&gt; I will follow the coast I expect hoping to find some surfer's and learn to
&gt; surf.

I don't think you'll meet much surfers, there aren't real high waves in
the Mediterranian, you can better take the west coast of France for
surfing.

About the Mediterranian coast. I thought Nice was very good (check out
my homepage, the picture of my green '78 Kombi was taken on the
'Promenade des Anglais' in Nice). Then Monte-Carlo is very nice to visit
(all is quite expensive though).

As we didn't want to pay for the Motorway we took the old route in
Italy, following the coast. It is called &quot;Via Aurelia&quot; and was actually
build by the Romans. Very nice, each KM-pole is a countdown to Rome, the
problem is that everyone wants to live at the coast, you drive from town
to town with a constant speed limit of 50km/h, really frustrating. (even
when you're a relaxed VW bus driver who's used to low speeds!!) So we
decided to take the motorway after all. Genoa was a bit of a dirty city
I think, not really nice. Then there's Pisa with it's famous leaning
tower. It's OK, but I didn't think it was that exciting. I expected the
tower to be bigger actually. And finally we went to Rome. A fantastic
city to my opinion, so my advice is: GO THERE!! I shouldn't forget to
mention Venice, also a nice place to go to, but I think Rome is one of
the most beautiful places I ever saw.

Here's some more T2 content: not much old Volkswagens around, spotted
some old beetles on the junkyard at the Via Aurelia just north of Pisa.
Saw a completely beaten up T2 panelvan with an amount of rust one will
only find on a mint T2 over here. &quot;no holes...WOW!&quot;
(http://www.type2_dot_com/molenari/jpg/rome.jpg) beside that I have the idea
that not much Volkswagens were sold in Italy. On the other hand, Greece
seems to be a real T2 paradise! Loads of old panelvans around,
completely worn out, but still there, rust free basically. So check it
out and surprise us with pictures!

&gt; Also I have a palmtop to take with me so how do I go about getting an ISP
&gt; for these countrie's and how do I access this list because it could be handy
&gt; if I hit problems

Any AIRS-members down there?


Vincenzo
