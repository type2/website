Subject: starter bushing

Anyone have a part number/source for the starter bushing that lives in
the transaxle housing?

Removed the old one, the new is WAY too thin, okay on the id, way off on
the od.  BD has a p/n 113301155 that appears identical to the one I have
that is too small.

Any clue?  Cali '79 Westy.

Ol' Jack that rebuilt my starter turned me on to the trick of tapping
out the old bushing.  Worked a treat, to borrow a phrase from across the
pond.  Used a 7/16 20 tap on a hex socket, taped that together, with a
3&quot; extension to get it started straight, then added a few extensions to
get some room to crank.

Thanks!

Teri
