Subject: Re: [T2] weber carbs and brake booster

Somebody must know of a way to add a vacuum port to one of the manifolds

Just go to the hardware store, buy a hose barb, and the appropriate tap and
drill to make a hole in the manifold.  Make the hole, teflon tape the hose
barb and screw it in the hole...attach the booster hose, and you are set.
