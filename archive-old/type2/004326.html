Ok, since I'm sorta new to this list and still pretty young, 24, I would
like to point out a few things to Ron that the vocal minority must have
overlooked.

1: The VW bus is a unique vehicle with unique needs and unique owners.  The
parent company has basicly given up on us, the loyal bussers.  VW not only
doesn't manufacture aircooled parts for us here in America, but they also
frown upon others making replacement parts and selling them.  Face the facts
people our vehicles are outdated, left for dead by VWOA, and yet they need
parts on a regular basis.  Other manufacturers like F*rd and Ch*vy, sell
their patents to other companies so they can continue to produce parts for
the older models Detroit has moved past.  This is where vendor's like Ron
come in to the picture.  He has probably spent much of his own time, sweat,
and money to provide us with quality parts.  If anything people, we should
be sending him thank you cards!

2: Ron and the staff at the Bus Depot have one of the BEST Online catalogs
period.  JC Whipme, RMMW, Bus Boys etc... may all be good companies to deal
with, BUT their online interface is weak.  Sometimes I go to your page Ron,
just to look at all the parts that will eventually need replaced on my bus
that aren't even advertised or listed as being for sale from the other guys.
( NO OFFENCE MEANT&lt; PLEASE KEEP THE FLAMES IN THE BBQ GRILL)  The only thing
that would make the Bus Depot online Catolog better would be more color
pictures.  Personally, I like not having to wait for an image of an engine
seal to download! ( Maybe I trust Ron's judgement on unpictured items)

3: Living in the Midwest, where there are not a lot of bus junkyards,  or
VWflaps it can be very difficult to find the parts I need.  Or when I do
find them they cost 2-3x Ron's prices.  I like to think that waiting a week
for something I've been looking for over a month to find  is not so bad!


Ron,
    Keep up the good work!  I would hate for my favorite vendor to shut his
doors because a few people were disatified.  I will continue to send my hard
earned dollars to Bus Depot for the parts I need.  I've only asked for the
list member discount once and even without it your prices are still rock
bottom!  Peace in chicken grease my friends.

Word,
Isaiah Smith
78 Champy (&lt;--waiting for me to order some more parts for her from the
Depot)
