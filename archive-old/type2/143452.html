Hello Keith     you need a volt meter to test the generator.  take the two 
wire off the top of the gen. hook your postive lead from volt meter to D+  and 
neg. lead from volt meter to Df  get a short jumper wire and hook it to the neg 
lead.  start the motor and touch the neg jumper wire to the body of the gen . 
then rev the engine and the voltage should jump to about 36 volts  do not 
leave the jumper touching too long  if it doesn't read at all then gen is bad.   
to test the reg take the two big leads off the B+ terminal and hook them 
together . hook the postive lead to the reg at B= and neg lead to the ground on the 
battery. start the engine and the voltage should be about 13.5    later  Mark
