 i'm getting an oil pressure gauge
&gt;and sending unit for my bus (VDO.)  i want to get the sending unit with the
&gt;terminal for the idiot light AND the gauge.
&gt;
&gt;so, simply speaking....if the picture of the gauge has 2 pointy things on
&gt;one end, and opposite is the end that fits into the engine....this is a
&gt;dual gauge for the purpose i am seeking?!

If you want to use both an idiot light and a gauge, the preferred method is
to retain the stock sending unit by placing a &quot;T&quot; fitting on the case and
attach the gauge sending unit there.

By the way, I was installing a VDO gauge this weekend, and the instructions
were for an older version of the gauge.  VDO America directed me to their
website, www.vdona_dot_com, which has all of their instructions in Acrobat
format ready for printing out.
