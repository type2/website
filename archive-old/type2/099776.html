&gt; You will certainly have to
&gt;modify the engine tin slightly to make a good seal around the new
&gt;compressor, since it is a different shape.

Okay, you got my attention.  Where does this bracket kit place the compressor?  What does it attach to?  Does it include a replacement pully that goes behind the fan?  I didn't see any more info on the web site.

Thanks,
