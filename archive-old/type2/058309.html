Subject: Poor Coachwork

(In which Hooper comes in out of the heat for a few minutes to pluck out a
message and to further enrich the Anheuser and Busch families.)

I got enough door bits with Pandora that I can make two good cab doors if I
apply myself. Upper frame from here, rubber from there, vent wing frame
with decent latch from over there, etc. So I am sanding and wire brushing
and rattle canning and all this takes longer than I might have thought.

I do not ever want to hear the phrase &quot;surface rust&quot; again. There is no
such G*DDAMNED THING as surface rust.

Beat your chests if you like but the coachwork on the later buses is much
better than this. I love splitties but these doors were tacked together by
people who either didn't care or didn't have time to care. None of these
door bits bear any evidence of primer, they have one very thin coat of
paint shot over bare metal--which might explain the not-surface rust.

I am presently sanding one with grinder marks all over it, over which was
laid paint. It might not be so discouraging if the bloke with the grinder
had got the high spots off but he didn't bother. I love this bus and I love
the whole _ethos_ but frankly the metal I have worked on today was
originally made with all the care devoted to a Hills Bros coffee can.

But we'll make it work. So what do you think of red? The parts I am
shooting now (window frames + package tray) are Rustoleum Smoke Gray but at
three dollars a can I'm glad we're above the belt line. Wal-Mart has this
fire engine red you can hear for 800 yards at 98c per can. Red &amp; grey? Am I
nuts?

My wife drove this bus for the first time two days ago, called it hers, and
put her Honda up for sale. I call that a victory but still I need to get it
finished well enough that I can call it hers as well...

CCing to type2 because it's a Pandora thing but please remove them from
your header if the reply is not bay-savvy...
