&gt; Hey hey to all
&gt; I have a couple of questions that I would like advice on.
&gt; 1. What is an appropriate solvent for cleaning the grease
&gt; out of my wheel bearings so that I may check them. Bentley
&gt; says not to use gas but doesn't give any alternatives
&gt; They say the gas removes too much grease abd will hurt the
&gt; bearings.

I think actually the problem is that gas leaves a film that may
affect the adherance of the new moly grease.  I clean mine first in
kerosene or gas, then final spray with a good brake/cv degreaser.

&gt; 
&gt; 2. I have 2 cv boots that are ripped and 2 that are not.
&gt; I bought 4 new ones for replacement. Should I go ahead and
&gt; do all 4, or sould it be ok to just do the 2 ripped ones?

Replace em all you got them out after all.
BTW chances are the cv's ae going to be in sad shape, might consider
at least reversing them axle to axle if not replacing them totally.

&gt; 
&gt; 3. My final question is in regards to the tranny linkage.
&gt; My linkage is suffering and needs overhaled. I however,
&gt; will not have the time until next spring. My question is
&gt; will driving my bus with cruddy linkage do harm to the
&gt; tranny itself?

Probably not if it still will go solidy into each gear.  Check
the alignment of the adjuster plate up front, you may improve it
quite a bit just there.  As to rebuilding it, you must of course pull
engine and tranny, and although the front bushing and cage are cheap
and available from WCM, the rear bushings are still not out there.

&gt; then delete it too...:)
