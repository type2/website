Jamie,

I have been running my Sony Xplod CD player vertically for 6 years in my
Jeep Wrangler's center security console. It has never given me a problem.
Since the Jeep sees a lot of Colorado off road use, I have been doubly
impressed.

&gt; One question I had for the CD player ,,, can it play CD's on the angle it is
&gt; mounted on..??
&gt; All the ones I looked at stated the player must be level...
&gt; Clarion was the only one that showed a 30 deg angle allowed..  so that was as
&gt; far as I went on the research... as I got a Clarion as a gift a few days
&gt; later.
&gt; 
&gt; I installed the speakers in the dash. I spent a few minutes with graph paper
&gt; and
&gt; copied the stock hole pattern from the speaker in the center of the dash..
&gt; then
&gt; transfered that pattern to the side where my new speakers fit.
&gt; The rear speakers fit in the hinge/spring cover... so I installed them, and
&gt; covered them with material.
