After many weeks of dealing with ignition troubles here's my dilemma:

1. When I set the points with feeler gauge, then check with a dwell
meter it's way off.
2. When timing is set and go for a test drive come and checked timing it
had advanced it self 5 deg.(yes I tighten it down), After readjusting it
back went for test ride came back checked it again lost 5 deg. reset
timing, and closed the tool box( thought about buying gallon of gas,
book of matches, And some marsh mellows)
3. While checking things I noticed that if I moved the Dist. the shaft
would stay still, got about 1/4 in. movement.

Now for the questions:
Can I rebuild the dist. or should I replace it?
Should I buy a 009 or stock (vacuum advance) I live in Cal. still have
to pass smog!
If I do need to buy one dose any one know where to get one on the cheap
(money is a problem)

P.S.
All parts are new.(coil, points, etc.)
