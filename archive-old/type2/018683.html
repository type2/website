'78 Westy.   Noise.   Rear.     Clickity - clickity - click

I had rear end of Westy lifted, and noise was created.  Major rear end
lift, higher than level, so I have an unintended rakish look.

First thought it was the emergency brake cable thing bumping against the
brake drum.  Nope.

Someone said it was my CV joints, not liking their new orientation.  I
was going to switch the rear axles to see if any difference in noise.
Instead, I replaced all four CV joints with good used CV joints.  No
change AT ALL in the noise from the rear.

more:  Noise became less obvious as the months went by.

This weekend, I took everything out of my Westfalia so that I could
remove the cabinets.  What a pile on my garage floor!!  I thought he
Westy would be much faster without all the additional weight.  Took it
for a test drive.

Noise is now back with a vengeance!!  More than attributable to the
natural soundproofing of a fully loaded Westy.

Big hints:: (1) The kids think it is coming from the center of the
Westy, not from the wheels.  (2) The noise was only at lower speeds
(5-15 MPH), and before last weekend, only on left or right turns.    Now
noise is from startup until 35 MPH,without regards to turns.  (3) noise
seemed more when the Westy was cold.  (4) plenty of left-right freedom
of movement in the axles.

Are these any kind of solutions::  (1) load Westy down with 1,000 lb.
over the rear wheels and see if noise is diminished , and  (2) if so,
lower the rear of the Westy to level.  I can't take it back to the shop
that raised the rear end, because I thought I saw the mechanic raising
the Westy from the rear by placing a jack under the motor; possibly tore
up my motor mounts?? ( I also have major CLUNK noise from rear when
going over speed bumps, even at very, very low speeds.  Clickity -
clickity - clicks and CLUNKs  Don't I have something to look forward
to...)

Any suggestions on the source of the Clickity - clickity - click
noise??   TIA Barry Burneskis '78 Westy
