Subject: Dashboard wiring help, please!

My 68 Westy is functional, but I could use some
serious help with the dashboard wiring and 
switches.  My wiring is a mess and half of the
switches are either dangling or have no knobs.
I do have the Bentley wiring diagram and have
followed it to the best of my ability, which 
isn't too good.  So, I have some questions...

What switches should I have on my dash?  

I currently have a push pull switch on the far
left with no knob.  Doesn't seem to do much.
I think it is for the internal lights.
I also have a push pull headlight switch.  This
will turn on the parking lights and headlights, 
but the dimmer doesn't dim anything.  No bulbs
in the dash to dim :-( 
There is also a wiper switch dangling below
the dash.  It works until I mount the switch in
the dash, then the fuse blows.
There is another light switch dangling below
the dash that isn't connect to anything except
two tube like things.  Don't have a clue what
this is.

Okay, now the wiring.  When I turn on the parking
lights or headlights the fuel guage goes beyond
full.  Seems like a short somewhere.  Any ideas?
Also, the high beams used to work, but no longer
turn on.  Related to the light switch / fuel 
guage weirdness?

Behind the dash, I have found a few loose wires.
A light blue wire that splits into two and I think 
should go to the turn signal indicators.  When I attach
these, the bulbs just stay lit.  Also, there is 
a thin black wire of unknown origin that looks like
it should attach to one of the small instrument
connects, but I don't know where it would connect.
The third loose wire is supposed to go from the 
headlight switch to the dashboard lights (speedo,
fuel guage, non-existant clock, etc).  None of these
bulbs or holders are there, so the wire is just
taped off.

Thanks for any pointers,
Brad Baker
