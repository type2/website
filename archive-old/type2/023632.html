Subject: Oil Leak Mystery
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello Everyone--

I have looked through the archives and found some good stuff on oil 
leaks...however I have a short question: I suspect my oil cooler is leaking 
because 1. I am losing oil but there is no drip when I am parked 
overnight...I lose the oil when I am driving. 2. I thought I could be burning 
oil...but there is no black exhaust and my bus is running great 3. And my 
heater box on the left side of the engine(driver side of engine) is generally 
covered with oil.....I just replaced my stock valve covers with the Skat 
fancy covers so I know I have a good seal there......So I am thinking it is 
the oil cooler....sound right....Thanks for the help.....Adam

Any hints on an easy Oil cooler removal?
