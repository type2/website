&lt;&lt; Don't need facts so don't need to listen to those with the most facts in 
hand, the engineers who designed and manufactured the vehicle. So good to 
know we have someone on the list to testify his subjective experiences have 
more weight than the factory.

 &gt;&gt;
Not to argue completely with this statement but other groups are involved
here that may skew some &quot;facts&quot;...The engineers may design the vehicle 
but the cost accountants have a great deal to say about the manufacture;
as do the regs in the countries where the vehicle is sold. The fact that non-
USA type 2's were carbed and USA ones went to FI is a case in point. I sus-
pect that price also is a deciding factor in what &quot;stock&quot; is - Boss Kettering
Engineering as opposed to the more analytical engineers...Hard to tell which
group has the final say...
