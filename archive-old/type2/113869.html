I vote for the clutch disc, or possibly a glazed flywheel causing &quot;chatter&quot;.  If so, it should be possible to start smoothly in first gear by keeping the engine rpm high and letting the clutch out very slowly.  This will overheat the clutch if you do it very often, so just use it as a test.
