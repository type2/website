&gt; My feeling is the Internet is helping to push prices up.
&gt; You can still get one for a decent price, but not
&gt; from someone on the net!

Well, it depends how you look at it. You may be able to get a 'good deal'
from an uninformed person who because he/she is not on the net is not aware
of the real value of the bus. All I can conclude from this is that the net
educates people.
