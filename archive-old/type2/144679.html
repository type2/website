Subject: New VW Van?

Hey guys,

    I was watching Detroit Autoline this weekend, and they mentioned 
inter-company &quot;marriages&quot; so to speak. Like, Ford / Fiat, VW / Porsche,
etc. But then they mentioned that VW was in the final stages of working
an agreement with Chrysler to build their new van off the next Dodge
Caravan platform. A couple things came to mind. Does anyone know if this
van is supposed to be, or will be the next &quot;micro-bus&quot;? Will it be a
modern rendition of the Bus like the New Beetle is to the old beetle?
Or is this just going to be a regular minivan that has the VW emblem on it?

Also, what does this mean for the current EuroVan? I know that the EuroVan
is no longer being made in the US, but last time I was overseas, I learned
that the EuroVan is still being made.. and is more popular in parts of 
Europe (like Holland) than the Ford F-150 is in the US. It's kind of cool
that they still call it the &quot;Transporter&quot; in Europe. In any case, does
this mean that they're no longer going to produce the Transporter in 
Europe too?


Just curious.


Thanks,

Todd
