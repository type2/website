Subject: What is the toughest climb you ever drove?

I think I missed the beginning of this thread, but the most difficult climb
I ever did in my bus was up to the top of Grandfather Mtn at High Country
Bus Festival two years ago.  We were doing okay until the last curve and my
bus just cut out.  The engine stopped and I was holding the break down with
all I could.  It was pretty scarey to me.  I let her roll back onto a
flatter area and let her cool down.  Eventually we got to the top using
first gear and parked on the cliff and looked over.  It probably wasn't the
smartest place to try and drive a bus to, but now I know.
