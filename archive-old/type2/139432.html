Subject: Re: [T2] Engine install update

Hi Tom,

That '75 transmission is the culprit... its bellhousing has thicker 
bosses on it for the stud to go through. I had the exact same problem 
crop up in the summer of 2003 when I was installing a 2L engine that 
came to me with the sunroof bus... it's studs were also too short. 
Luckily I still had the old 1.8L engine in the garage and we were able 
to swap the old ones in so we were soon good to go.

Unfortunately the  problem made me miss the first half of the 
&quot;SARS-Stock&quot; concert that was on TV that night, but at least I was able 
to get the job done in time to go on vacation in the bus that weekend.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
