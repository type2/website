Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding door track lube question

&gt; the sliding door works great but I did noticed after cleaning on the dust 
&gt; out
&gt; of the track there was no lube at all. Should this be lubed? Ratwell 
&gt; mentions
&gt; lubing the track in his article but the door slides so easy...

    Lube. Lube. Lube. Not only will the door slide easier but grease will 
help
keep the rust at bay (Sorry)...If your track is anything like every track 
I've
seen, there's no paint left (the original rust protection... ;-( from the 
friction
of the roller in the track...
