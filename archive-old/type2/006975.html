&lt;&lt;  anyone ever modified their spindles for an extra bit 
 of drop. I was told the T2 is too heavy for welded T1 
 style dropped spindles. I dont belive this weld is mondo 
 strong done correctly. Or does any one know of 
 someone who sells them. Info/opinions please.

wolfgang has been making drop spindles for splits for some time, and last
