Subject: alternator testing

Hey Alex,

If your alternator is working OK now, what you first need to check is
the brush assembly.  The test at Pep Boys will only tell you what you
already know......  What you are really asking is how long the
alternator should continue to function well.

Check that the armature rotates smoothly and the bearings feel nice.
If the brushes are below the wear limit [see Bentley], get a friend
with a soldering iron [hint: model RR fans generally solder well] to
help you install new ones..... cost of parts
under $5.  I got mine from www_dot_carparts_dot_com  and was reasonably
pleased.  Another approach is to buy the complete Bosch
brush+regulator assembly.  Their craftsmanship on this item is quite
notable and it is worth the price -- especially if you are not into
soldering and/or you expect to keep your vehicle a long time [IMHO].

Hope this will help you.
