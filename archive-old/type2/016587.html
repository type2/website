Subject: Brake Booster Hose Replacement

Volks:
I just got done fixing the brake booster hoses on my
'71, and I thought (since the details don't seem to
appear in the archives) I'd post what I did.  First of
all, I can't believe what a difference it makes, having
powered brakes (or boosted brakes) as they were
intended to be.  Since putting my new engine in (and
suspecting a vacuum leak) I'd capped the nipple from
the manifold off, which means that although the bus has
stopped fine, I've REALLY had to stand on the brake
pedal. Okay, here's my procedure:
1. Make sure your brake booster works (I had mine
rebuilt by the guy in Dallas- excellent service, plus a warranty.
2. There are 2 sections of 1/2&quot; interior diameter brake
vacuum hose that join a metal line; the first is about
a foot long and runs from the metal line to the
booster, the second runs from the engine compartment to
the metal line, and is about 4 or 5 feet long.  The
1/2&quot; hose is very expensive: the NAPA retail price is
$7.99 a foot, but the FLAPS guy treated me like I
worked for Indiana University (which I kinda do) and
sold it to me for $2.69 a foot.  Lest you think this is
outrageous, the VW hose (from the dealer sells for $83.
for 3 meters.
3. The basic problem involves the fact that the check
valve (buy a NEW one from VW for $10. or so) and the
booster line are both 1/2&quot; (or whatever the metric
equivalent is) and the nipple from the manifold is
1/8&quot;; no one either at the dealer (or the FLAPS) could
explain how to get from the big hose to the small hose;
it's not on the parts microfilm at the dealer (the
parts guy is a big aircooled fan, and not only did he
let me look at the microfilm, he gave me all kinds of
plastic connectors and some VW promotional pins).  
4. Here's a solution that works: buy a boatload of hose
clamps, and some GOOP or other contact cement.  Buy a
1/2&quot; to 3/8&quot; heater hose converter; but a &quot;universal&quot;
hose converter that goes from 3/8&quot; to 1/8&quot;.  The setup
looks like this: Brake booster, hose clamp, 1 foot 1/2&quot;
hose line, hose clamp, metal line...hose clamp, 4 feet
(or so) of 1/2&quot; hose line, hose clamp, check valve,
hose clamp, 2 or so inches of 1/2&quot;, hose clamp, 3/8&quot;
converter, hose clamp, a couple of inches of 3/8&quot; hose,
hose clamp, universal converter, hoseclamp, a couple of
inches of 1/8&quot; hose, hose clamp to manifold.  I GOOPED
all of them together as I went, and tested the seal by
sucking on it to see if it would hold a vacuum (the
more it sucked, the better it was).

There are undoubtedly more elegant solutions, but I
couldn't come up with one here; the original line (28
years old) was cracked, rusting, and undoubtedly leaked
like a sieve.

Hope this helps, 

Dan
