 Peter-
I went out to start up the bus in order to move it up on some ramps so I
could chack out the master cylinder. Brake warning light came on when I
turned the key (normal), then off, would not go on after that. Fixed
itself? I don't think so, I suspect a bad connection was causing a false
light. Anyway, for now it is intermittent.

John I.
