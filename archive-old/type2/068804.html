Subject: Changing front trans mount, splitty

Hi Volks

I took a break from fixing my buses this weekend to spend some time with my
family ... or so I thought. I'm half way thru replacing the clutch on my
wife's 63 bug (pressure plate broke, can't get a 1200 clutch anywhere in
this country) so I let her take my split van to work on Sunday late
afternoon (she works the evening shift at a newspaper). She returns 10 mins
later, says, &quot;the gearshift just went all stiff&quot;, throws the car keys at me
and rushes off to borrow her mother's car to get to work.

Well damn! In theory I have four running cars. The Dormobile stands inert,
waiting for new brake hoses (nobody here stocks them, so they're on order
...); the wife's bug awaits a clutch (nobody etc ...); my 57 Kombi is
parked in by the above two cars, and it's not licensed anyway; and now my
daily beater panelvan has a &quot;stiff gearshift&quot;. I reluctantly changed into
working clothes.

A quick inspection showed the damage: the front transmission mounting had
sheared right through. Gearshift had been getting a little dodgy lately ...
these things always warn you if you only listen ...

I know I can't buy a mounting over the counter because I tried recently
(and especially not on Sunday evening!), but luckily I had a good used
spare so I was ready to go ... or was I? Uhhh, one small point -- the only
comfortable working space left was occupied by my wife's bug with the
engine on the floor. DOH!

So I had to quickly refit a clutchless engine to the bug and push it out of
the garage so I could work on the van.

Now to the point of this lengthy epistle: **You can change the front
transmission mount without removing engine or trans!!!**

Magic? Trickery? Here's what I did:

(Insert usual very important safety reminder about working under cars!!!)

1) Disconnect battery.

2) Place rear of bus on jack stands and remove rear wheels.

3) Remove rear rocker panel.

4) Place trolley jack under rear trans mount bracket.

5) Loosen lower shock mounts and remove four bolts holding each reduction
box to spring plate.

6) Remove front tranny mounting bolts and nuts holding rubber mount to trans.

7) Disconnect shift linkage.

8) Remove two huge rear tranny mounting bolts. (Engine and trans are
resting on trolley jack, remember)

9) Using crowbar (protect trans case w/ block of wood), gently lever
engine/trans backwards until you have just enough space to remove old mount
and install new one. Engine/trans will pop back into position when you let
go the crowbar because clutch cable etc will pull it back. You may have to
guide the studs through the holes in the trans.

10) Reassemble in reverse (or preferred) order.

11) Check all your work and that your levering engine/trans hasn't popped
something out of place.

12) Drive to work on Monday morning.

You can also use this trick on a Beetle. I'm sure that some folks will
frown on my method, but it sure beats removing engine and trans to do an
emergency trans mount change.

As we say in South Africa: &quot;'n Boer maak 'n plan.&quot;
