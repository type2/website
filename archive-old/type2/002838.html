First, thanks for all the replies. I received 25 in the first 24 hours.

I finally got back to it today. Nothing would go through the tube. The
vacuum cleaner idea was good but I blew on the flex section and not even air
would go through. I took a length of electric fence wire and determined that
the blockage was about 6 inches from the rear of the metal tube. I even
tried putting my electric drill on the wire to &quot;rotor rooter&quot; the blockage
out. That did not work. The final solution was to cut the metal tube with a
dremmel tool just in front of the blockage and gently bend the tube apart. I
then had a 6-inch section at the back of the bus that I could work on from
both ends. I reamed at it from both ends and sprayed carb cleaner and WD40
and finally got it open! Then I gently bent it back to line up again and fed
the cable through. Next, I have to tape heavily around that area to keep
crap from getting in through my cut, but not yet because the cable WAS TOO
SHORT. :-(  I took the cable out of the 1971 bus but guess the 69 model is
different. Can anyone confirm this? It needs to be about 1 cm longer. Some
wire fixed that for now but the engine would not start, and gas was leaking
from the lower linkage and dripping off the area where the cable attaches.
Is that a common problem in a engine that has been sitting for a long time?
I put another carb on and that baby roared to life. Looks like I will make
HCBF after all. Still have a lot of work to do but I will make it.

Thanks and any further input appreciated.

&gt; Anyone have some hints when the new one refuses to go in? Have all but
about
&gt; 3 feet with push pull push pull. I am at a standstill and had to come back
&gt; to work for a while. I hate busses sometimes. I am desperately trying to
get
&gt; this poor girl running before the High Country Bus Fest. New engine in,
all
&gt; new fuel lines, fresh seals, then this. I do not even know if it will
start.
