Subject: Re: [T2] towing question

This thread can become like religion with people weighing in on both sides.
Myself, I've pulled three buses by dolly this year, fresno to Van Is, Oregon
to Van Is, and from Hope to Van Is. One thing I've found is a dolly pushes
you and your brakes less than a trailer. Easy to see why,a dolly weighs a
fraction of the weight of a trailer and a good part of the weight of the
towed bus is on the ground. One thing I have to worry about that most people
dont is ferry cost, a dolly is shorter and a whole bunch cheaper to cross
with. That said, check your load and check your trans fluid and be carefull
of your downhills and you should be fine.BTW anybody remember the original
UHaul tow bars that clamped to the bumper, now those were scary!!

&gt; I've done a few hundred miles with a towdolly.
&gt;
&gt; Disconnect the half-shafts if you like. I didn't but would in the future
to
&gt; be sure I don't ruin a tranny. There are things spinning in there that
&gt; don't normally spin much without the engine running. In other words some
of
&gt; those shafts might not get enough lube but what exactly I don't know.
&gt;
&gt; Lastly - be sure your tow vehicle is big and heavy. A bus can start
pushing
&gt; you around on downhill slopes.
&gt;
&gt; I prefer a flat tow or all four tires off of the ground given my druthers.
&gt;
&gt; As far as disconnecting the driveline - it's a 30-45 minute job on a bad
&gt; day... 1 tool.

&gt; &gt;I need to tow a 74 bus from Ohio to NC. Assuming I have no
&gt; &gt;special equipment, which I don't, what is the best way to do
&gt; &gt;it? I called a rental place, and they said a tow dolly couldn't
&gt; &gt;be used because the &quot;driveline is too hard to disconnect&quot;. They
&gt; &gt;suggested a trailer (all 4 wheels off the ground). Yea, nay, bogus,
&gt; &gt;or right on?
