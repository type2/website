&gt;Well, I dunno.  Most gasket shifts occur during initial install and unless
&gt;you have several hours to wait for the weatherstrip adhesive to set (with
&gt;the gasket properly held in place) it will be just as slippery as anything
&gt;else.

The 3M I use dries in about 5 minutes max.

&gt;  I think that the scraping (and inevitible scratches)
&gt;involved in cleaning weatherstrip cement off the cover result in more
&gt;annoying drips.

Wipes clean with a rag and kerosene or mineral spirits or nail polish 
remover. No scraping at all. What I'm talking about is 3M Weather Strip 
Adhesive. It comes in yellow or black. It is not a cement. It stays 
pliable. You can just about rub it off with the fingers. Typically, the old 
gasket just pulls right off with most of the adhesive on the gasket. I use 
it exclusively because I NEVER have problems with the gasket shifting 
during assembly, it's easy to remove, and quick to use. You must be 
thinking of some other generic brand of cement/adhesive.
