&gt; Yup, 15 is positive and 1 goes to the points...same on all VW's.

thanks that's what I thought but was unsure and couldn't find anything
difinitive in Bentley

&gt; Weak spark measured where?  at the center post of the coil?  Before it
&gt; goes anyplace else?

center post of coil
&gt;
&gt; Resistor block only handles ground to the injectors.

right knew that but it was one of the things I had'nt checked before

&gt; Put the pertronix back in....

sort of where I'm at but it would be nice to know the points worked in
case of emergency.  maybe condenser????
  yeah ran out of light yesterday so putting Pertronix back is first thing
I do today


&gt; Check voltage at the positive side of the coil to the engine case...then
&gt; to the body and let us know.

good point, can't get it out if it doesn't get in.
&gt;
&gt; Check the voltage with just the positive  coil wire not  hooked to
&gt; anything....referenced against the voltage from battery terminal to
&gt; battery terminal...why is it different?

will do, shouldn't be different

&gt; Got anything else wired to the positive side of the coil that might be
&gt; drawing a lot of power?....or something wired in with it up front when you
&gt; turn the key on?  How much voltage from the positive wire at the front
&gt; of the bus...once again?  different from battery terminal to battery
&gt; terminal?

hmmm,

&gt; Checked trans to body ground strap?  I think you *did* finally go thru
&gt; your electrical and if I remember correctly, put on the really nice battery
&gt; straps and connectors?

correct, a ground wire is run direct from battery to coil mount bolt

&gt; Run a wire straight from your battery pos side to the coil...with nothing
&gt; else hooked to the positive side of the coil and then see what your spark
&gt; looks like...

good idea, will check that.  I've had loose wires in the past so gotta
check that too,, although I've done the wiggle wire route with no effect

thanks
Bob
