Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a bus from being stolen

How about a hidden, keyed switch, to operate a solenoid breaking the main
power lead to the front of the bus. This will kill all power to the front.
pretty hard to hotwire that sucker! Too bad if you have anything needing
power though (clock/radio etc).
