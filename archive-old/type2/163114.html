Subject: Re: [T2] Pain(t)/body

&gt; For the price that you paid for the paint work, they short cutted
&gt; something---
&gt;
&gt;  The zinc chromate acid etch primer, the urethane sealer / primer, and
&gt; the base clear urethane paint wasn't used--you got straight enamel, and
&gt; there wasn't any final surface wet sanding and buffing.

Just so Bob has the facts right, I did get urethane paint, and it was
their second tier quality paint (higher urethane content), not their
cheapest.

As I stated, I did all the prep myself. By the content of Bob's post,
I inferred that he has pretty much stripped his bus already, too. He
did not mention that he needed a great deal of body work.

Sure, if you pay someone else to R&amp;R enerything including the rubber,
it's gonna cost you. Those costs are not part of what I meant by a
simple single color exterior paint job.

My bus is a daily driver, not a trailer queen, but definitely still a
looker. Yes, I'm happy with it, and I feel I got more than my money's
worth.

I think collision shops simply overestimate whole car jobs because
they don't want to do them. That's not someone I want working on my
stuff. Shops like Macco and Miracle _specialize_ in whole car
painting; it's their bread and butter.
