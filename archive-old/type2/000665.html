Subject: RE: Solid Light--don't flicker: Ballast Resistor?

&gt;Testing at my injector, I get a solid light when turning over the
&gt;engine (it's not firing). Is that the ballast resistor or the
&gt;ECU's fault? or something in between. The brain needs a signal
&gt;&gt;from the dizzy to tell it when to apply voltage, right? Maybe I've
&gt;got something wired wrong there?
&gt;
I looked trought the FI and general electrical schematics of the van. It
would appear that if you switched terminals 30 and 50 on the starter(should
have female spade lug connectors on them) you would fire both sides of the
double relay and the fuel pump would run continuosly as long as the key was
in the on position. This would be voltage present on position 86a which
would also carry voltage to 86 which is connceted to the cold start valve
&quot;fifth injector&quot; and also the thermal time switch.

&gt;And Sean, your description of Steve's problem is very close to my
&gt;own. I keep thinking my ignition switch is worn out, but maybe it
&gt;has something to do with wiring...or maybe that worn solenoid has
&gt;some impact on the FI system...like maybe there's not enough
&gt;voltage coming in to part of the FI system to trigger a critical event?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks! Joe
&gt;
Somewhere I read 9.6 volts is required to trigger FI events.
