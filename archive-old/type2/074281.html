Subject: Dual Carb Stacks

I finally did it.  I wanted to increase the air flow on my dual carb motor 
but because of the linkage and other crap in the way I was unable to get the 
clearance (height) I needed.  So after weeks of looking at the breathers on 
the floor I headed down to the local exhaust shop with the breather and carb 
(rubber gasket) in hand.  In ten minutes the guys were able to cut to length 
and flare out the carb end to make a custom stack.  It looks great.  The 
effect was evident the first time out, it roars. And for those of you that 
swear fuel injection is the way to go, come visit me in Germany as I have a 
fuel injected two liter and dual carb motor set up (stock) for my bus. The 
carbed motor runs circles around the FI  motor, top end and pick 
up............                             
Peace Out
