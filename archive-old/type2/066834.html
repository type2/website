Subject: Re: 65' bus door key question

The security thing is this.  If you get the key number off your 
neighbor's bus, and lock person makes a key for it, and you steal the
bus, it becomes a MAJOR security problem.
Sending him the tumbler PROVES that you own the vehicle, for if 
the tumbler is out of the bus you have to have bus in your posession, 
or at least have access to it.
And besides, he can check that the key works, in case someone has 
messed with the tumlber and the code key doesn't work anymore.

I would rather you vote against me than not vote at all.
Get out and VOTE on November 5th (USA folks that is !)

&gt; Thanks for the suggstion michael, but to my way of thinking the &quot;key number&quot; is 
&gt; stamped on the very door lock I would be potentially sending him? :) Kinda 
&gt; defeats the &quot;security thing&quot; don't it?

&gt; &gt; him a tumbler (easiest is from rear cargo door); don't just send the #;
&gt; &gt; it's a security/antitheft thing.   If # isn't visible, he'll put a &quot;feeler
