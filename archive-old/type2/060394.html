&gt;          I think you guys are talking apples and oranges here -- Dr.
Williams
&gt;  has a  later Type 4 engine, with the real long curved dipstick going in the
&gt;  top of the crankcase -- and there aren't any dipstick temp senders that fit
&gt;  those engines AFAIK. You are trying to apply what he did to fix his oil
leak
&gt;  to your Type 1 or very early type 4 straight, short dipstick, I believe.
&gt;  

Dip stick senders are on sale in the UK that will fit a type 4 engine, but I
cannt find any manufacturer or supplier details at the moment.

Suggest someone rights down the manufcturers address aoff a short dip stick
and drops them a line.

Good luck
Bob
