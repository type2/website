Subject: Re: [T2] SingleCab bumper = Any other splitty bumper?

&gt;I'm looking to purchase a straight rear bumper for my new '60 SingleCab 
&gt;- Is there any difference between this bumper and the bumper from any 
&gt;other early model Type 2?

This is a question better posted to the vintage list.  But the simple answer
is yes - the rear bumpers for the trucks differ from the bumpers for the
buses in that the corners are much squarer.  Why?  Because the corners of
the pickups were square so the bed could be square.

If you find a proper truck bumper, be prepared for sticker-shock.  When I
had my 58 single cab I tried to find a correct rear bumper for quite some
time.  I found prices STARTING around $500!  I guess that explains why so
many of the trucks are running around with no rear bumper.

What I don't know, however, is if you can adapt a bus bumper to fit a truck.
Maybe some cutting or re-shaping of the bumper?  Maybe a slightly longer
mounting bracket?  Ask on the vintage list and you'll probably find the
answers.
