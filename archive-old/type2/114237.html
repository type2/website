Subject: 73 AW on Rte 60 E/B

Coming out to my mom's today (L.A. to Banning), I saw a white on blue Adventurewagen parked on the side of Interstate 60 westbound. I stopped to investigate and found a note under the wiper that stated they were having transmission trouble and would be back to get the bus. There was a highway patrol sticker on the back from 5/29. I left a note referring them to the closest VW shop I knew of (Walter's in Banning) with my phone number.

Do we know anyone from L.A. with a white on blue 1973 Adventurewagen? It's got the earlier 3/4 high roof with the luggage rack on the back.

BTW, the cargo hatch had the &quot;AUTOMATIC&quot; emblem on it, so I'm going to the library to research auto trannies in case they call.
