&gt; &gt;He's speaking about the &quot;flapper&quot; in the AFM.  In my experience,
&gt; &gt;putting the pedal to the floor on a Volkswagen when starting only
&gt; &gt;helps when the mixture is too rich since it introduces much more air
&gt; &gt;into the engine which helps burn the excess fuel.
&gt;
&gt; Ahh yes, I had the wrong flapper. Isn't the 'flooring it' a visious cycle
&gt; since introducing the air to burn the fuel asks the computer for more
&gt; gas to burn with the air anyway?

Not in my experience.  For several months I traveled around with a defective
thermo-time switch that would allow the cold start valve to open if I tried
to start the engine when the engine was moderately warm, flooding the
engine.  If I put my foot to the floor and cranked a bit, I could usually
get the engine started.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;The cold start system is completely independent of the ECU.  If the
&gt; &gt;thermo-time switch senses that it's cold enough it allows current to
&gt; &gt;flow to the cold start valve when the key is in the &quot;start&quot;
&gt; &gt;position, opening up the valve and giving the engine that
&gt; &gt;extra &quot;squirt&quot; of fuel it needs on startup.
&gt;
&gt; Sneaky thermo time switch, then does the cold start valve not ground on
the manifold (therefore two prong connection to supply a ground?)

I must admit I'm not really sure about that having never successfully
puzzled out that part of the wiring diagram.
