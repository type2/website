Subject: What's that hole...

Hi list! I have a question that I'm having trouble answering on my own.
Checked the archives, but maybe I don't speak boolean well enough to make
it work right for me. Engine in question is a 78 GE code 2.0. On the very
front of the engine, up at the top of the mounting flange, between the left
engine mounting stud and the centerline of the engine, is a large hole. It
is about 1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter, about an inch or so deep, and it
has a smaller hole (about 1/4 inch) at the far front. What is this for?
Should there be something in it? The reason I ask is because there is oil
just spewing out of mine. It only spews when the engine is warm. It may
leak at a slower rate when cold, but I couldn't see anything. When warm
however, the leak is QUITE noticeable. Looks like a small Niagra of oil. Am
I missing an important piece, or is this indicitive of a blown front oil
seal? Bottom of engine looks ok, until the oil from the top starts running
down through all the cracks.  Thanks for your time!
