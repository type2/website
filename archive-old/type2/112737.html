Subject: web cam

I was looking at the Web Cam site and checking out the prices for getting my
cam and lifters reground.  Price seems good and they're in Riverside, not
far from me.  Are they good?  Is it worth it to get the cam reground or
should I buy a new cam and lifters?  I'm looking at $110 for reground cam
and lifters versus $250 new

thanks,
Mike
