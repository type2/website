&gt; Huh---ya learn something every day.
&gt; I'd figured for sure with that bizaare engine hanging out on the nose it
&gt; would almost have to be FWD.
&gt; How they get the power to the back wheel--A Reynolds Chain?
&gt;
&gt; I knew BSA had a short run of this cosmic set up too Tony--But for some
&gt; reason the Morgan stuck in the back of my head.
&gt;  
&gt; Never seen one in person--just books.
&gt;
&gt;     The three wheeler set up was for tax purposes...Three wheeled &quot;cars&quot;
were taxed at a lower (motorbike) rate than 'real&quot; four wheeled cars...
     Same goes for weight...&quot;Light&quot; cars were taxed less than &quot;heavy&quot;
cars...Google up a picture of an &quot;Austin Chummy&quot; to see how close
friends can get and not require an X-rating...8-)
      Taxes also controlled engines...The tax was originally based on
piston size only; which favored very long stroke engines...
