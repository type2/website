Subject: RE: found leaded gas-works great!

&gt;I'm as &quot;green&quot; as the next person, but come on. It's important to know what
&gt;is dangerous, but it is just as important to know how _much_ you can &quot;get
&gt;away with&quot;. I look forward to the day that affordable zero emission
&gt;vehicles are a reasonable option, but, until then, I think I'll take my
&gt;chances.

When it comes to lead, there really is no amount that we can &quot;get away
with.&quot;  Studies have shown that the lowest detectable levels of lead cause
significant brain damage to infants; extrapolation shows that extremely
small traces (parts per quadrillion) cause unacceptable levels of brain
function impairment.  In case you are wondering, if we stopped all
production and use of all lead today, all of the lead in the environment
will continue to produce human exposures well in excess of ppq levels for
over 100 years. Consider this as well: some of the highest levels of lead
in soil (high enough to consider the soil a hazardous substance as defined
by EPA) are found in a great many playgrounds which are often located next
to roads where many, many leaded-gas consuming vehicles have driven.

Gasoline today uses benzene to do the same thing that lead did previously.
Benzene is a rather carcinogenic substance, but is at least not nearly as
persistent as lead.  We hope that soon a viable alternative presents itself
(indeed I suspect a great many viable alternatives are being held back by
short sighted enegy consortiums).  The Rosen brothers are working on a
flywheel system; in a Mercedes 300E (i think) they claim 0-60 accelaration
of 6.0 sec at twice the gas mileage of a current Benz 300E.

It is unfortunate our beloved busses are not the most environmental of
vehicles.  I guess I'm hypocritical, but I figure maybe the positive
attitude generated by driving my bus (in both me and the people who wave
and flash peace signs) somehow offsets the environmental degredation it
produces.

Sorry to go off on such a tirade,
Eric
