Welcome,welcome,
  I am glad you decided to join us! I have missed your posts after droping
from the vintagvw list. I hope I can be of some help to you, I am about 1/2
done with the Cali conversion. I have taken several pictures and I am about
90% done with my new web page that will show some of what is going on with
that. So far, the conversion has cost me $35 for the book and less than $50
for everthing else. I scored some real good deals. I am going to start on a
second conversion when I finish this one. First one goes into the 71 Bus. 
  Let me know if your e-mail addy will let you receive attached pics and I
will send you some preveiws.
BTW dished pistons have a small &quot;dish&quot; cut into the top, this lowers the CR
by increasing the combution chamber volume. This is a good thing for a
street Bus, good for extended life.

Hi gang.  This is No Quarter from the vintagvw and vintagebus listserves
here.  I've been on the vintagvw list since 1993 and can well remember the
several incarnations of the type2 list over the years including the
division of the lists to cater to the splitty, bay, and vanagon crowd.
One of the guys on the vintagebus list suggested I sub to this list and
I've done so with an alternate email addy.  My main one is
silent_at_beatricene_dot_com

The reason I've subbed is that I'm wanting to rebuild a T4 and do Joe
Cali's conversion on it so that I can run it in my 67 bus and possibly a
bug in the future.

I thought that for all the questions I have, this would be the place to
hang out and ask away.

Bare with me through all of this. :-)

For starters, I've built a 1776 T1 engine for my bus but I find that I
could really use more power.  I'm concerned about longevity and it's
getting to the point where I almost resent adjusting the valves.  I want
something powerful and reliable and a little easier to maintain so I've
decided to build a bone stock 2L T4 engine.  I already have new P/C's and
the pistons are dished.  Dunno what that means.

I'll stop there.  I'll ask more questions later.  Glad to be back with you
bay windowers again.
