    Sure there is -- I've got a vehicle that does just that. See below.

&gt; 
&gt;  When you are trying to get less voltage than your charging system, you
&gt; can put two batteries in series, but you should try real hard to balance
&gt; the load on them, as they will get the same charging current (Kirchoff
&gt; is _always_ right, just like Ohm.)  Many diesel tractors have two 12V
&gt; batteries and a 24 V starter with loads taken off both batteries.  Some
&gt; even let you switch some of the loads so you can &quot;equalize&quot; the
&gt; batteries.

     I have a  1961 Mack B61 semi-tractor that has two 12v batteries, a
12v generator, and a 24v starter. Don't have the manual down here with
me, so I can't give you a diagram of the wiring, but it definitely
works, and it's stock. Of course, the only time it's putting out 24v is
when it's starting, and the generator isn't charging at that point. The
batteries don't get equalized, either. One's a regular sized large 12v
like you might use in a car, the other is one of those big long monster
sized you only see in trucks and tractors. It runs the rig's lights when
under way, the other is only used in starting, AFAIK. Actually, it's
supposed to have two big 6v down there in the battery box where I've got
the big 12v, which would give you even more cranking amps. Some guys
have told me to put 4 big 6v's down there, which would fit, and forget
the little battery box behind the cab, but that seems to be stock.
