Subject: Dr. Tim

Who is/was Dr. Tim ? Why is he/she not blessing the mailing list anymore ?

Anyway, whoever she/he is, it is a delight to read his/her posts in the 
archive.

I replaced the locked star adjuster on the rear left drum over the week-end 
and adjusted. Too much hammering, drilling, filing , i really felt like a 
non-pro...

- No more locking of the rear right wheel when braking hard :)
- Van still steers to the left at the beginning of breaking and then to the 
right when the pedal is released :(
- Front right wheel is warm after my 12 miles commute
- Front left wheel is not warm after 12 miles commute

The right front brakes is sticky and slow to react to brake fluid pressure. 
It will be a pleasure to check this out now that the sun is back in socal - 
sorry we got the nice weather back. Yes the camper is two inches too tall 
for the garage...

- Arnaud
