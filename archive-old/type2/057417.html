	Michael,

Use a vacuum cleaner. Tape a small hose to the vacuum cleaners hose. The
hose has to be small enough to go in trough the plug hole. Put the vacuum
cleaner on and fish around in the cylinder with the hose. If the screw is
still in there it will soon be suck onto the end of the hose. 

Don´t ask how i know ;-)
