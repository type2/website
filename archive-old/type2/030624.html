Rob, 

A wonderful idea. By all means convey my deepest regrets.  Saying I only
knew him via e-mail seriously degrades the friendship I felt for him.  I
know most of you only via your electrons, and feel closer than with many
people I know physically.  Josh was quite special both in that he was
always willing to take on a task, whether list related or an abandoned
bus. Definitely one of the best.

For everyone's information, the local paper has a web edition and an obit
