&gt; To be honest, they look better than any fuel line I have seen in recent years.
&gt; They are rubber with a cloth covering. There are no cracks or bulges anywhere
&gt; at the ends or in the runs of the line.

Alan, I'll make this simple for you. REPLACE ALL FUEL LINES. If you
cannot say without any doubt they have been changed within the past
year, replace them. It's not worth the big chance you take just to not
have to deal with possible leaks if you change them. A lot better than
trying to decide what to do with the burnt hulk of metal left after an
engine file.
