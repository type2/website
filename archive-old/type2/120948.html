Subject: Re: storage of paint cans

I am still using the same can of acrylic enamel I used for touching up a
dent back in 95--I had drilled a hole in the center of the lid and
shook/squeezed out enough paint for touchup or airbrushing, resealing
the hole with a sheet metal screw.  Store it upside down-shake/mix the
can before use.  If concerned about air in the can, drop finishing nails
through the hole until the level has come up.  They help in mixing the
can also.
    For some varnishes, I store them in squeezable soda bottles and keep
all air out; great for Tung oil products.
