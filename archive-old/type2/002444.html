At the risk of being scolded by the committee now running the list, I too
have to chime in and say I am sorry to see Scott and the Wayback machine go.
Hang around this place long enough and you'll see a lot of people come and
go, but it's the ones who were around when you started out that make an
imprint (just like ducks in a way, eh?) I read Scott's post about ball joint
installation repeatedly before attempting the job on my own '70 bus, and
believe me it helped. Many happy miles have passed under those ball joints
since. Thanks Scott, and I hope life brings you another bus soon.
Bob
