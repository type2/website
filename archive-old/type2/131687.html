Subject: Bolt &amp; Nut Sizes

Hi Folks,

My engine is in the final reassembly stages, and I'm renewing some hardware, 
so a trip to my local big-box home center is in order.  To minimize my time 
there, I'd like to get some bolt &amp; nut sizes &amp; thread pitches from The List 
before I go.

Specifically, I'm looking for the following:

Muffler Bolts -- pretty easy to fake them, but I'd like to get them &quot;right&quot;
Tinware Screws/Bolts -- the ones with the 10mm hex head or the flat screw 
head
E-brake cable nut -- Bus Depot says the flat/curved ones are NLA, so I'm 
just looking for a regular nut -- unless somebody has the real one for sale!

While I'm waiting, I've been replacing a lot of stuff that has deteriorated 
over the last 25,000 miles or has never been replaced.  New filters (fuel, 
air, oil), new E-brake cable, new dual battery isolator, fresh paint on all 
engine tin, new rotor, cap, wires, plugs, new engine seals.  I'm sure my Bus 
will run even better that it did when I put it away.  And I'm just in time 
for winter!

Thanks in advance for the help.....
