&gt; I second Jamie's suggestion. I had this problem and cleaning these

&gt; &gt; she'll start but she runs very very rough, will not idle, will not

&gt; I am going to guess,,, a bad ground under the air distributor....

cleaned, no effect
changed the condenser.  no effect

still will sort of run but not long or smooth

this is a 5/50 job,  50hrs to find the problem, 5 minutes to fix.


I am getting VERY VERY frustrated..

don't know what is left to miss. gotta be something basic here
