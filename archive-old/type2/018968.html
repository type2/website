Subject: bus underwear - seriously
Message-ID: &lt;3807CBA9.7C6_at_attglobal_dot_net&gt;

ok - i've been a good list member, waiting till friday. I posted this 2
weeks ago but was rejected because my service provider changed my e-mail
address
anyway

I bought these at the target at crossroads in raleigh NC.  But check
your local stores, the fabric is out there.......



Man, my wife would never let up if she read this message ;-) 
She always jazzes me when she sees messages like: &quot;did you see the bus
on the X-files?&quot;

But - 
I purchased a pair of bus and bug flannel underwear today in Target.  
I have no idea why I was even in that section - weird - the cosmic force
of the bus pulled me there

the bus underwear has numerous buses on it.  The buses are blue and
white ~71s I think (turn signals below the lights-can't make out the
vents)
With the spare tire mounted on front.

The bug shorts have numerous yellow bugs on them.
They were on sale - 3/$10

really nice shorts - I guess they knew you need flanel underwear in
VWs.  Brand name - honors

add them to the shopping list
;-)

off to ocracoke
