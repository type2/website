Zac,
    I've never dealt with a suby conversion, but don't you need a radiator
to run that engine?  I don't know how much it'll like being converted to
air-cooled.  I'd love to know if you have already tackled my question and
found a solution.  Just a thought though, look at what Subaru spells
backwards.
