Subject: windshield wipers

ok tested my wipers last night and heres what i done and what happened...

everytime that i put the fuse in the fuse box the wiper motor makes a awful noise,.,.,.(loud moaning )

well i pulled the arms away from the window and put the fuse in and back and forth they went...

gently as they went i laid them against the glass and they stopped and the motor went wahahagsghvsgahjahaahja all kinds of loud noise again...

almost like the gear inside is broke or teeth are gone or something...
heck i dont know ..
cant figure out why they would do this,.,.,.&gt;?

i been useing rain x and works great but sure would like to use the rain x plus wipers,...
would make my driving and seeing experience so much more safe LOL....

got into a storm day before yetserday and at 30 mph the rain x held on 

thanks
and peas
