Subject: SUMMARY:  Friday survey: Stuff that doesn't break.

Hi Volks,

I had 10 responses to the survey, so it's a long way from a 
representative sample.

Reportedly unbroken bus components:

Original Seat Belt mechanisms
Ashtray
Brake Drums (they might wear out, but don't &quot;break&quot;)
Steering column
Door striker plates
12V accessory socket
Upper rear hatch
Rear axle spring plate
Gear Shift knob
Headlight trim rings


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
