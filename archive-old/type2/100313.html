Subject: Re: [T2] the canadian border

It's totally luck-of-the-draw. I'm in Canada right now, and the borders at 
Houlton, Maine were no trouble. It was 8:45 at night, and I'd been driving 
since 9 in the morning... very tired. I got pulled in for a once-over, but 
so did everybody else in line. The guy in the drive-through window 
recognized me from a trip about a year ago, described the passengers I had 
then and everything. Weird. The guy who did the actual searching asked me to 
stand aside &quot;for my own safety,&quot; and asked about five times if I had any 
pot. To most of the world, it's a hippie bus, and there's not much you can 
do about that than live with it, be polite, and don't give them a reason to 
tear your bus apart looking for drugs. He was very incredulous when I said 
no, but didn't look very thoroughly either. I'm sure they just get bored 
late at night and want something to do or somebody to talk to for a while. 
They were very polite and I was out in twenty minutes, maybe less. It's 
coming back in that I'm worried about.

&gt;all in all, it was terribly annoying, especially knowing they were going to 
&gt;find jack sniff unless they had themselves a dog. and even then, just the 
&gt;dog food stuck under the rear bench seat from the PO.
