Subject: voltage regulator update

A while ago I mentioned that I replaced my voltage regulator because the
headlights were pulsing.  What surprised me was that I have a 70A alternator
(original) but the regulator (original) was the Bosch model rated for the
55A model.

Now, my battery trays are in terrible shape.  Could the batteries have
boiled over from the wrong regulator and caused most of the damage to the
battery trays?
