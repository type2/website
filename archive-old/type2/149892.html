Subject: A &quot;feel-good&quot; Bay sighting

I was going up highway 285 yesterday to drop off some trannys to famous
&quot;Steve the Transmission Guy&quot; in Pine, CO. I talked my wife into going with
me and we were chatting about how 1 mph of headwind slows us down by 5mph.:)

We came crawling up one of the many hills and low and behold a beautiful
pre-72 beige and white westy weekender! He and his passenger gave me a peace
sign (I just wave) as I literally FLEW past him. It really helped my wife
understand we drive the &quot;hotrod&quot; of early bays. And that is with a 1600 sp,
two adults, two huskies and three trannys in back! Wheeeee!

Can't wait to get my FI 1914 motor installed!

&quot;Always remember where you came from, cause going down is a lot more fun&quot;

Oh and it was great to see someone else braving the +90 degree heat for some
good times.
