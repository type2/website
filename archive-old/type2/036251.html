To do a leakdown test you have to have the piston at top dead center to
fire. To do this you need to screw the hose in the cylinder you are going to
test, then rotate the engine in the direction of rotation until you get
compression coming out the hose. Turn the crank to TDC on that piston. Apply
air. Does the air push the piston down? If yes: you are not on exact TDC.
Bring the piston back and try again. Apply air. Crank stays put? Now read
you % of leakage. Should be under 20, preferably 7-10.

Subject: leak down test


&gt;
&gt;  I recently bought a leakdown tester. This is a pump with a gauge which
one
&gt; can use to get info on how well the rings and valves seal.  The exact
&gt; difference between the info given by one of these versus a compression
&gt; checker is not clear to me. Nevertheless, I used it for the first time
&gt; tonight on a 1776 which I rebuilt and which I just got  running on a test
&gt; stand.
&gt;
&gt; The results were discouraging. Evidently, one is supposed to get a vacuum
&gt; of about &quot;30 pounds&quot; and then monitor the rate of decrease of this value.
&gt; Regardless of how rapidly I pumped, I could never get a value better than
&gt; 10 and it dropped to zero within two seconds.  This was so unnerving, I
&gt; tried it on another cylinder with the same result.
&gt;
&gt; To check the tester, I plugged the end of the adapter with my finger and
&gt; indeed a single squeeze of the handle gave 30 pounds and this value held
&gt; until I released my finger.
&gt;
&gt; The rings are new. The cylinders were honed. The ring gaps were arranged
&gt; according to Bentley. I poured alcohol in the heads and saw no evidence of
&gt; liquid leaking past the closed valves.
&gt;
&gt; So, a few questions: Has anyone done this test on an ac engine? Can anyone
&gt; suggest a reason for the lousy result?
