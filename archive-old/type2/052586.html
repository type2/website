Subject: [T2] Simple question.....

Hello all,
     I am in need of replacing a part on my VW bus.  In the steering 
column there is the mechanism that controls the wipers, turn signals, 
and horn.  This piece does not look so good and I would like to 
replace it.  Can anyone tell me what it is called and where I could 
possibly purchase one online?  BusBoys_dot_com??  Thanks for the help.
