Gail and the volks,
   Gail said &quot;...and was not spoken to the entire time I was there.&quot;
Seems like that is how it is at the shows, but at bus campouts the opposite 
seems to prevail.  1999 was the first time my wife and I went to any campout 
even though we've been driving buses for more than 20 years and were LIMBO 
members for about 5.  We were so favorably impressed by the people at that 
one (Westies in the Woods, New Jersy) that we've gone to more.  My most 
notable experience was at Everybus 2000.  With-in minutes of pulling in 
someone came over to strike up a conversation, when they realized I was far 
from home they took me around to the various groups of buses and introduced 
me to a lot of people.  At one of those campfires I was invited to stay for 
dinner.  I spent the evening sitting around their fire, eating their food, 
drinking their beer, and swapping bus stories.
   My advice to you would be to look for a campout for buses.  In fact, if 
anyone is looking for a friendly crowd, come to Limbo on Long Island.  June 
8- 10 (Fri-Sun) Indian Island County Park, Riverhead, N.Y - The 1st annual 
&quot;LiMBO on Long Island&quot;.  Caravan through wine country. Raffles and prizes. 
Potluck dinner on Saturday night. Contact: Andrea and Brad Rasso at
