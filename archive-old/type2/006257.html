Well was drivin' the '72 Westie(Twinkie) tonite when alll of a sudden no
power and lots of racket coming from the right rear wheel.Pull over and get
into a parking lot when the right wheel falls off.  I was not movinmg
anymore when the wheel fell off.  I was very lucky as been going 60 10
minutes before.  Step out of the bus, much further down than it ever has
been before. Look at the wheel and the drum has about a 1/2 inch chunk out
of the edge and pieces of cotter key are laying there.  I stripped the axle
and the nut. So I get out the jack and jack it up and wait for the tow
truck.  Anybody know where I can get a rear right wheel shaft and a drum.
Or can I use this drum for a time till I can get to a junkyard for one or if
someone on the list has extras?????  Anyway looks like I will have VW
memories on Memorial Day fixing the problem if I can get the parts here this
week. Ron is there anything elser that I should be doing while I am this
deep into it.  CVJ's repacked, I don't know what else should I be looking
for.
