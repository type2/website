Subject: [T2] paint question.

Hey volks.  My 71 bus was born all white, but from weather conditions in the 
northeast it slowly became a spot and primered rough surfaced vehicle.  I 
want too get the finish paint on by next fall, but for now i was thinking of 
putting a household paint job of forest green on it.  My question to the list 
is when the resto comes will it be harder and more labor intensive to get the 
new paint off?  

later,
-Brian and and a 71 westy
