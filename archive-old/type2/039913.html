Subject: Re: Staples for canvas (Stainless or Monel)

I checked into this when I replaced my canvas last year.

Most staples you buy for a hand operated stapler are galvanized.  In fact, 
the original staples in the old top were also, and with no sign of rust.

Now I did special order a box of stainless staples for the pneumatic stapler 
I have.  These are a wire type of staple, and worked well.

My advise is if you can afford the $25 box of stainless staples, go for it.  
Otherwise, the galvanized type should work well.
