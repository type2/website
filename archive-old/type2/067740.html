Subject: Re: Vendors on the list

I gathered info on several hundred VW vendors a while back. I intend to
compile a sort of vendor directory, which will hopefully include a feedback
form through which people can add vendors or comment on vendors.

It'll be Christmas time before it debuts, in part because I have several
sources I need to go through before the list if finalized...in other part
because I'm too busy right now.

Thanks! Joe Fournier


&gt;
&gt;&gt;Ken, you had at one point mentioned that you were going to set up a web
&gt;&gt;page with experiences dealing with different vendors.  Is this plan still
&gt;&gt;in the works?
&gt;
&gt;Hell, I'm still working on threading the digests (333 and counting).
&gt;
&gt;I still want to do it, I think it would be a way excellent service to the
&gt;VW community. Except, you know what? All I can remember is a long thread
&gt;excoriating GEX, and of course the ongoing kvetching about the Bus Boys
&gt;catalog. There may be more in here, I'm not done threading yet, earlier
&gt;issues last.
&gt;
&gt;Somebody posted vaguely about problems with Mark Stephens not long ago, but
&gt;he wouldn't put the details up in public. Litigious society. Our loss, no
&gt;gain.
&gt;
&gt;Not that I want you to go out of your way to flame vendors, whether they're
&gt;on the list or not. We expect a certain consideration for the sake of
&gt;propriety no matter who we are. My take is that as long as the account is
&gt;factual, and you don't go out of your way to harm a man's business, you're
&gt;probably okay. But I ain't a lawyer.
&gt;
&gt;At any rate if there aren't but two or three threads about vendors I'll
&gt;just leave them in the general archive. It's up to you all, not me.
&gt;
