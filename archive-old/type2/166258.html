Subject: Re: enrichment via cold start valve switch

Hmmm, guess one could use an extra CSV to inject nearly anything into 
the mix, like water or ether?

Can't you put in an inline resistor to fool the ECU into thinking it's 
colder and thus enrich the mix in a controlled fashion??  I envision an 
inline digital ohmeter where you could dial this on a variable resistor 
(potentiometer).

  the cold start valve at any time. It comes in handy
  for passing and a little extra boost on hills - times
  a little enrichening will actually help. I used it
  together with another mixture control circuit to
  enable using that last quarter of throttle that the
  fuel injection system doesn't give you enough fuel for
  - like 90mph on up!
