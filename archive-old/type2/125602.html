Subject: RE: [T2] Building door panels

&gt; My original door panels are somewhat damaged, warped, etc.;
&gt; I've been considering getting some new ones and covering
&gt; with cloth material the same color as the original green vinyl.



We sell unfinished door and interior panels, already precut and ready to
be covered by your fabric, paint, etc. The price is much lower than
finished panels.
