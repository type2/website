Steve (Leslie's husband):

The air cooled Vanagons don't really have a &quot;head gasket&quot; in the same 
sense as the typical water cooled engine.  There may or may not be a 
&quot;shim&quot; between the top of the cylinder and the head, but that's there to 
adjust compression ratio and provide a sealing surface for the 
cylinder/comprssion chamber.  Since there shouldn't be a lot of oil in 
the cylinder, getting signifant oil from this area really isn't possible, 
absent a BIG head problem that you'd probably notice first as a loss of 
power.  

Most likely the leak is coming from the pushrod tubes or, more precisely, 
&gt;from the pushrod seals at either end.  Since the pushrod tubes go in 
place after the head's in place, you can actually replace these tubes 
and/or seals without dropping the engine or removing the heads.

&gt; My 1980 air-cooled vanagon has excessive (1 quart in 500 miles) oil 
&gt; leak.  I have removed the cooling tin from the bottom of the motor and 
&gt; after wiping down the drips and running in place for 30 minutes, it 
&gt; appears that the oil is leaking from the push rod tubes and possibly the 
&gt; head gasket itself.  Is it possible for the head to be leaking oil or 
&gt; did oil collect in that area from the leaking push rod?  That area is 
&gt; the steel tin below the heads.
