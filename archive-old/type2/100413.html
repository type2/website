Subject: help, dropped valve???!!!!

Fellow Listees,

I replaced my heads on my 71 Westy single port engine with rebuilt heads 
from Roy Rodgers. Engine was making a ticking sound so I went to adjust the 
valves.

#3 exaust valve is tight, and so tight that even when I unscrew the 
adjusting screw thingy, I still can't get the feeler gauge to slide in.

I am certain that I am in #3 firing position.

Is this a dropped valve? What else could it be? Advice whatever would be 
greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Daniel
