Chad, I haven't recieved my list for a couple days(?) So I didn't see 
any of the replies you got, but here's what set up I've got in my 71 
bus: 1835cc motor from GEX International(read their ads for what's in 
it, I assume it's the least expensive version) dual Weber 40s, 009 
distributor, remote oil cooler/filter, no heater equip, cheap header 
exhaust system. I bought it this way and have put over 30,000mi. on it 
in three years with no major failures until last month when the 
90,000mi. tranny  died. The engine,according to PO's paperwork has 
60,000mi on it now. It requires pretty frequent tuneups &amp; backfires 
some, but I'm real pleased with the performance esp. off the line at the 
stoplight! I think it sounds cool, too. Your 72 probably has the type 4 
motor that doesn't have as much aftermarket stuff available, but it's 
out there.

Aloha,
Lisa in Hawaii
