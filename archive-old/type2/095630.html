Subject: Cheap 72-79 Tail Lenses

A distributor sent me a shipment of non-U.S. spec '72-79 tail lenses by
mistake instead of my normal U.S. spec ones.  Rather than sending them back,
I will offer a special low price on them to any listmembers who are
interested, while supplies last.

The difference between these and the stock U.S. ones is that the lens is all
red (except for the white back-up light section) rather than red and amber.
You can see a picture of this lens at
http://www.motorworks_dot_com/images/p13992B.JPG .

The price is $16.95 for a PAIR.  By comparison, Rocky Mountain Motorworks
charges $64.00 a pair for the same ones!

The part number we're using is 211 945 241R/2 .  However, this part number
is not on the website at this time (and may never be, if listmembers scarf
them all up).  You can order it one of three ways:

1) By phone, using the above part number.
2) Via the website, order quantity &quot;1&quot; of part number 211 945 241RE, which
is a single standard tri-color lens. But specify in the &quot;comments&quot; section
of the order form that you want a 211 945 241R/2 (a pair of the red/white
lenses) instead.  We'll manually change your order to the correct item and
price before shipping.
3) Or if you have ordered from us before, and your credit card info etc. has
not changed, just shoot us an email (to  sales_at_busdepot_dot_com ) with your name
and address, and we'll enter the order for you and email you a confirmation.
