Subject: what gas heater is this one

Hi Michael,
it might have been a Eberspaecher B1L or a Webasto HL18B. Both B's mean
Benzin = petrol, non Diesel. Both L's means Luft = air.
Both are as half as big (small) as a shoe-box; ca. 1.8 KW heaters.
The only additions are external fuel-pumps and exhaust-pipes.
I've had both in different type 1s (self-installed),  great &quot;modern-style&quot;
heaters. More efficient and easier to install than the old BL4/6's.
Very reliable.
But not so stylish. Roughly 900 $ each new here in Fatherland.

Best wishes
Michael

&gt;a friend of mine once owned a post 1972 camper with a gas heater under the
&gt;front seat... am I imagining this is was the entire unit located there...
and
&gt;what type of heater is that model.

&gt;I own a 1971 and mine is in the back drivers side of the engine compartment
