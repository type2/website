&gt; Has anyone ever routed their gas heater into the stock heating system?  I'm
&gt; wondering what the pro's and con's are in doing something like this.  If
&gt; this was done, how would one block off the heater boxes?  Would the defrost
&gt; work better?

well when I get it back in my gas heater is 100% of my heat since the
engine heat is long gone.  I use a recyling system with the air intake
behind the dash the heater under the bus and then spliced back into the
regular ducts just behind the axle beams...works pretty good.  best
defrost I've ever had that's for sure
