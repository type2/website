Subject: older types: 2 the

After a hard lunch, I say -

OK,  so why do we keep these older types around any more:::

They creak and moan and are never able to go where they went before.

They leak and embarrass us wherever we take them.

The newer (younger) ones are faster and sleeker and don't look so bad.

They probably won't get to where they are supposed to get.  I.e., the get up 
and go has got up and gone

It costs too much to keep them going.

The fix-it and maintenance costs exceed the value.

You say:
OK, so why do we keep them around??

Faster is not necessarily better.  (OK, slower is also not necessarily 
better, either)

They don't make them like that any more, for a good reason!!

Replacement parts are hard to get, but it feels so good when a donor gives 
up the needed part to keep them alive.

Memories.

If Ferdinand didn't want them around, He wouldn't have created them.

If there were something better, we would sure know about it by now.

Getting out of bed and to the neighborhood corner means so much more to the 
older types.

In the end, they're a damn good tax write-off.
