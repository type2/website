Subject: My 76 Westy

Hi all,

     I got my very own 76 Westy now.  Just got it home.  I am hyped.  As far
as I can tell, almost everything is there.  Even the little loops for the
curtains.  The book says that the child cot is basic equipment but it seems
to be missing.  The cabinets are in very good shape.  They need a little
cleaning up.  I even have the owners manual &amp; Campmoble manual in the VW
plastic envelope.  More later.
