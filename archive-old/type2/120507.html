Subject: re: mine all mine

&quot;I just threw them on for the picture, I would likely
slide them over to where they would not be intrusive.
This guy has them on his bus too...

I R &quot;this guy&quot;.. these bumper whatchamacallits were
available (so I am told) from VW. I've never looked
into
it but rest assured they are not hacked.. they fit
very well and the attachment method leads me to
believe they
are a VW item... they just fit to well not to be made
for the bay bus bumper.
