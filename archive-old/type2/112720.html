Subject: Re: [T2] tuned exhaust

Hi Clark,

I recommend a louder radio.

I have had a monza extractor, empi dual, and stock mufflers on my bus. 
The Monza gives good performance, but is louder and does not last 
wellup here in the rust belt. The Empi looked and sounded best but also 
didn't last. Stock is best for quiet operation and longevity but costs 
more upfront than the other options.

I am quite looking forward to putting my wife's 77 Sunroof on the road, 
it came with a 2L FI engine featuring a custom exhaust made out of 
cast-iron pipe. I've had it running in the driveway, and it sounds much 
betterb than it looks. Thank goodness it'll be hiding under the bumper. 
Unfortunately, I won't be able to get it on the street until I resolve 
problems with the brakes, throttle linkage and balljoints.
