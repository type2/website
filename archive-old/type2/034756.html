Subject: Fwd:  Rec. Vehicle or Daily Driver?

Hi,

&gt; ... I ... am wondering
&gt; if I can satisfy my need for a daily driver and a bus
&gt; at the same time. Concerns about bus as daily driver
&gt; are reliability...

 This needn't be an issue as long as you get a sound #
vehicle and maintain it adequately.
 I'm currently commuting about 45 miles each way in my
'77 camper. I've put over 30,000 miles on it in the last
two or three years and have yet to be let down by the bus
(though I concede that I've had to futz with it a few
 times to get it going).

&gt; ... and, being in the snow belt, heat. 

 This can be a major problem, the heat system wasn't great
when the busses were new, it's often neglected and may take
a fair bit of time &amp; money to get it working adequately.
 It can, however, be improved and there's a lot of expertise
on the list and it's associated website(s) on the topic.
 If you have the time, a little money and the patience then
it can be made to work very well, just don't expect the PO
to have put in the effort!! :-)

&gt;  Is a 21 - 31 year old vehicle a good candidate for what I
&gt; need?  ...

 It is certainly a reasonable candidate. Should be cheaper
than many alternatives, too (in the long run).

... I am impressed by what I've been reading
from the list members and their love of their buses. 

 Oh, yes. Plenty of character in a bus.

 For a daily driver I'd suggest a late-'70s bus with
hydraulic lifters and a 2.0 litre FI engine, unless you
are really tight for money, in which case an earlier 
&quot;upright&quot; engined (1600cc) one might be cheaper to run.
 The FI 2.0l engines are strong, relatively powerful,
come on busses with servo-assisted disc brakes and need
slightly less routine maintenance than the solid-lifter
engines.

 Hope this helps. Good luck, anyway :-).

Cheers,
	W.
