I've seen turnkeys, but they are probably built up on this side of the
border from Mexican parts.  They have all been carbed, AFAIK.  

It would be way kewl if you could get a FI turnkey, or even a complete FI
system for a type 1 engine.  I have a feeling that the price would be
quite dear, though.
