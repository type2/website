Subject: Stripped Bolt Misery

Anyone have any ideas on removing the three stripped bolts from the fan?

Oh, did I mention that they're kind of stripped and in there tighty tight 
tight? I thought it was a regular 6 point.... That's what happens when you 
pay attention elsewhere...

Thanks for listening to my misery.....
