&gt;Brazilian Mahle piston and cylinder sets and German made Mahle sets?  Also,
&gt;where can German Mahles be purchased??

My warehouser says German production NLA. You might call a VW dealer to see
what they can get, danded the cost. There are only three differences
between anything of German manufacture vs Brazillian: quality, price and
longevity. You could surf Germany and perhaps get something. And by all
means, check with Ron at Bus Depot and other high volume direct importers
from der Fatherland. Many of the NPR sets have been shown to work very well
and might be available in the aftermarket as well. 

If you want a 100,000+ mile motor, German is the only way to go. All it
requires is clean oil and reasonable maintenance and adjustment.
