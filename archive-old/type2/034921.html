Hi list just bought a all original 74 pop top and found a few surprises in
the van. I found a cot looking thing under the back bench. Its about 5 feet
long and maybe 4 feet wide with two poles sewn into the ends. The poles
have a small 90 degree bend on each end. Is this the childs cot? And if so
where does it go? Also how do you get the stove and fridge to come on? Do i
need a second battery? Does anyone have a 74 westy manual? I have the
original type 2 manual, but not the westy one. Also have the &quot;jump seat&quot;
that fits in the middle of the front seats, anyone interested in a trade
for the manual?or anything else??
