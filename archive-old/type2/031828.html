Subject: Re: [T2] No A/C on '71 Westy

Bryan,

If you have a reset button on the outlet, that usually means you have a
GFI outlet(Ground Fault Interruptor).  This is what saves you when you
drop your hiar dryer in the tub with you.

It could be bad(I've seen them go bad), but it is probably busy saving you
from electrocuting yourself.

Plug the tv in somwhere else and see if it works.  Unplug the extension
cord and plug something simple in to the outlet and see if it works.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; I recently purchased a '71 Westy 2 weeks ago so its
&gt; &gt; been sitting in my driveway while I get it road
&gt; ready.
&gt; &gt; I have the extension cord running to it so I could
&gt; &gt; have my 9&quot; t.v. out there so I could watch the news
&gt; &gt; while working on it. It's been working great until
&gt; &gt; last night when I unplugged it to move it. I plugged
&gt; &gt; it back in and had no juice. First I checked the
&gt; &gt; extension cord--it was plugged in and was giving
&gt; &gt; power.
&gt; &gt; I then hit the reset button on the outlet--it
&gt; clicked
&gt; &gt; but I am still not getting any power. Does anybody
&gt; &gt; know what happened or what to check??
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; BK
