Subject: Wanted: 79 PCV valve

I'm looking for the PCV valve for a 79 california emissions 2L.  At least
that is what I think this thing is.  Its a round plastic thing with a
diaphram located on top of the oil breather box.  Would prefer new, but a
good used one would work also.  Part number on mine is 022 115 303 A.  It
also has the number 30 000 60 917 MHO on it.

Any help in locating this would be greatly appreciated.
