Subject: soon to retorque heads, etc...

The etc. refers to all those other little jobs that one might just as
well do too while the engine is out. Besides retorquing the heads,
here's a list of those little things. Feel free to add suggestions! :)
Btw, this is a T4 from a '75 bus, 1800 F.I. My constraint is that I
really have only one weekend to do this, including reinstalling the
engine.

* measure end play. My distributor gives me a total of 45 (!) degrees
advance. Excessive end-play *could* be a reason as the crankshaft's
forward motion causes the distributor's drive gear to turn a bit. (Did
I get this right, Bob?)

* measure valve lift. The valves need frequent adjustments --every
1000 miles-- so I suspect there might be some uneven wear on the
lifters. Or maybe on the cam lobes, but I don't have time to split the
case. A superficial job to get me through next year and about 5,000
miles is all I need. I'm thinking about replacing the solid lifters
with hydraulic ones. I KNOW they come with different cams, but I heard
the difference isn't major (David?) and I'm willing to call it an
experiment. Nevertheless, if anyone *knows* this is a stupid idea,
please stop me. So, does anyone have a used (but functional) set
of hydraulic lifters lying around for sale? 

* install oil temp sender into sump plate (I have the dipstick sender
now and intend to compare both readings: I bet there's no difference).

* find a better place to attach the VDO CHT sender. IMO, the best
place for accurate reading is at the spark plug, but unfortunately the
sender interferes with a good seal and causes blow-by. The sender is
now at the same location as the CHT sender for the fuel injection, but
also in the path of cooling air; hence the reading is not only too
low, but also unreliable. (When the engine is turned off, the temp
reading actually climbs at first; this didn't happen when the sender
was in the spark plug hole recess.)

* replace one of the exhaust studs of one of the heads. The machine
shop that rebuilt the heads last year put in a stud that's too short.
I'm afraid this may be one cause for running hot since the bad seal at
the exhaust manifold might allow fresh air to be sucked into the
combustion chamber. I tried to replace before, but was unsuccessful.
With the engine out, I hope to get better access, but am not
optimistic.

That's all I can think of now. Feedback will be appreciated, as
always. :)

Sami
