Hi renoir here,

Not that i am an expert with the distributor driveshaft but i did take mine
in an out at least ten times.

First, you can compensate by taking off the dist drive gear and rotating
180, good for the short term.

But, if you remove the fuel pump and rod, and of course distributor you can
gain easy access.

Then take a dowel or stick of some relatively hard wood.  Sharpen one end so
that it will very snugly fit into
the top of the dist drive shaft.
You may have to make many adjustments to make it stick.

Hammer wood shaft in to drive gear.

Then carefully wiggle rotate counterclockwise to pull up. Make sure you are
on #1 Tdc and then drop back in.

It took me many times to get the feel of doing this, hours. I hope you are a
quicker study.

good luck
