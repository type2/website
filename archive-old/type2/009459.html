&gt;Here is my solution and I would like some feed back as to it's plausibility.
&gt;
&gt;Have you ever seen a tool truck (Snap-On or Mac) with a roof AC unit and
&gt;the generator running?  Around here, they leave the generator and AC on all
&gt;the time, on the road, or parked at a business.  Why can't I do that with
&gt;our '76 Westy?  I would put the generator in a small trailer and pull it
&gt;behind the bus with an extension cord hooked to the bus.  The generator


     Cool idea, but quite a lot of expense. Honestly, I would stick 
w/electric hookups at campgrounds, and go to the unimproved ones in the 
fall/winter. The idea of towing a generator kinda sounds like overkill to 
me, when there's lots of admittedly boring KOA sites w/hookups...

     Also, the NREL (National Renewable Energy Labratory) did some 
interesting research a while back on the subject of non-cfc 
airconditioning-basically consisted of systems that de-hydrate the air, 
then use a form of evaporative cooling. Got the paperwork on it if 
anyone's interested in implementing it-I don't have the time.

     Then there's my solution-try to relocate back to coastal California 
where AC generally isn't necessary...  ;-) Job hunting from a distance of 
2k miles is a bit of a pain though...


Peace,
