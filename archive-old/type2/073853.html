Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Heat - CO and Slow Death

RoadRunner sends:

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Carbon Dioxide buildup in an unventilated area is a serious issue. Gas
&gt; heaters are not meant to be used in small/closed spaces.
&gt; 
&gt; Old VW's are not air tight. CO2 levels should not reach a serious level
&gt; if you leave your windows cracked a bit. However, don't roll the dice -
&gt; if you use a gas heater (in your van or your house) you should buy a
&gt; Smoke Alarm that can sense serious CO2 levels.

Don't you mean carbon monoxide?

Carbon dioxide, which is a simple asphyxiant, and carbon monoxide, which is
both poisonous and flammable, are totally different things. Is there a CO2
detector? I know it's real easy to get a CO detector at any department
store. I have one in both my Bus and my Bug.

Considering the design of the aircooled VW's &quot;heating&quot; system, a CO detector
is a necessity for any VW owner.
