	BRAVO!
	Our family had a '68, bought new, and we used to go on skiing trips
in the early 1970s. One of my favorite memories of that time is coming
home from same, driving along the highways of Washington State, in
the snow, in shirt sleeves, with my shoes off and my feet propped up on 
top of my ski boots to keep out of the water from melted snow down on the 
rubber floor mat. In short, it was HOT. In every seat in our 9 passenger.
No aux heater. Keep it working or make it work, and if it doesn't,
hey, something's WRONG.

	Bill
