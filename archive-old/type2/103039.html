Subject: Re: [T2] help! BA6 switch

Joel,

Check the ba6 shop manual pages here: 

http://www.chaos-tours-la_dot_de/VW-Bus/BA6.htm

They are in German, but have great photos/diagrams.

Since I am expecting a complete BA6 for my bus any day now,
I had already searched for an instruction manual.

Cheers, dave

&gt; The problem is that there are 10 terminals on the back.  Does anyone know
&gt; the proper hook-ups. I think one is for switched power (while running), one
&gt; for unswitched power ( for the timer ) one for ground (?) and of course one
&gt; to go to the heater.
&gt; 
&gt; I can't seem to get the switch to change the voltage of any of the
&gt; terminals.
&gt; Any help would be most appreciated.
