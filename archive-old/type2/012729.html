Subject: Tank Leak
From: &quot;Simon Ramirez Jr.&quot; &lt;carapace_at_onebox_dot_com&gt;

Howdy all,

I have a question, with a bit of urgency.  Last go 'round under the bus,
I saw a wet spot around the fitting that comes out of the bottom of the
gas tank.  Right away, this made me a bit nervous.  I was already changing
the inline fuel filter, since I was back there, but I wasn't really sure
about what to do about that leak.  It sn't a drip, per se', but it does
stay moist.

So, how do I or what do I need to do to get that fitting sealed up proper?
 I see how close it is to the starter, and it gives me the willies!!!

Thanks,

Simon Ramirez Jr.
