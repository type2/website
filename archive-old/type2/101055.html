Subject: Re: [T2] Dealer Price List

Richard,

I order some parts for my sliding window day before yesterday from the 
local vw house.

They have changed ownership lately and started supporting all of the 
local vintage vw events lately....even free t-shirts at the big 
Eureka springs show in August.

They let me look thru the EKTA electronic catalog for the parts that 
I needed....sure enough, the little pastic slider came up as NLA, but the 
rubber that I needed *was* listed.

He ordered it and said it should be here in 3 days.  We will see if
it actually shows and is the right thing.  He said that if it was listed
on the EKTA stuff, then they should be able to get it.

I was in luck cause I ordered it from a 81 vangon parts list rather than 
the 78 bus parts list.  Sliding windows were the same when I looked at
an 81 last weekend.

Maybe some things *are* possible!

Cheers, dave

&gt; I went to the VW dealer to get a part and the guy at the counter is finally starting to get into the routine...
&gt; 
&gt; At first he wouldn't look up parts for me because I had a 78 model, then he started looking up parts if I gave him the numbers but often he would have to refund me because the part was unavailable even though the computer matched the number with a description.
&gt; 
&gt; Now he confirms that the part is still available before ordering anything by looking up the number in a phone book sized tome with all the part numbers in it.  It was called Dealer Price List, June 2002.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have this or know where to order it from? I imagine it's a dealer only thing but it would be so handy to have and save me some time. He offered to give it to me when it's replaced but he doesn't know when that will be (maybe Dec?) and I'm sure he will throw it out before he remembers the promise he made.
