&gt;      I have a 70 Westy that is my daily driver. I was on one of my normal 60

&gt;coughed. No matter what I did with the gas pedal, I couldn't get her to
&gt;respond. Then just as quickly as it happened, it stopped. When I got to my
&gt;destination, I checked the fuel filter, and it was loaded with garbage.

Jim,

When was the last time you replaced all fuel lines, fuel filter, filter 
sleeve in gas tank,
cleaned and lined the gas tank, and rebuilt your carburetor(s) and fuel 
pump (&amp; checked
the length of the fuel pump operating rod)?

A clean fuel system is a happy fuel system.
