Subject: Poptop Clean!

hey now,

i took Misha the '77 Westy (with good old fashioned valves! :-) ) to a car
wash today. this is only the second time she's been out of the driveway
since we bought her.

put $5.00 in the machine and used the high powered rinse to spray off all the
mildew and grime Misha has accumulated over her 5 year sleep under the POs
shed. took about 10 minutes and i got 3/4 of the poptop clean. unfortunately
i ran outta time and quarters so i haveta go back again. but it looks almost
new. sure beats scrubbing which didn't do much good anyways.
