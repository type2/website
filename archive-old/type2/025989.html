&gt; I'd take that challenge,
&gt; especially if Rick keeps towing stuff ;-)  It'd be no contest on a 1/4 mile
&gt; though...stock fuel injection is great but no match for my 42DCNFs (sorry
&gt; Rick).

Just to let everyone know how strong even an old type 4 is, the 2L engine
that I had in my bus came out of a rusty westy that was purchased with
170,000 showing as the milege.  The engine had been sitting so long, all th
seals had to be replaced because they were dried out.  It took close to 50
miles before all the hydraulic valves pumped up the first time.

This engine has seen a bunch of miles, yet it just went from Kansas to Cal,
stopping in Arizona to pick up a Scamp then pulling it to Cal and back.
Also along the way, one of the splitty busses in the caravan quit and so I
towed it from half way through Cal to Flagstaff which is a long uphill
grade.

The engine and bus did great, never really got hot and had good power,
considering the load it was pulling and carrying.  Type 4 engines are built
to last, of course as with any engine, there will be a bad one now and then.

If any of you know Charlie Ford and his bus the Mother Ship, he has over
200,000 on his engine and it has yet to have a valve job!

So Steve, this engine has already stood the test of time and is still giving
me miles of smiles!!  But it would still be fun to race!!  Just name the
time and place buddy, are we racing for pink slips?
