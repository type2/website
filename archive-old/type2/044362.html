Subject: [T2] 72 Progress-Trans Switch Soon

The 72 bus progress - after shoring up the vacuum leaks and tuning the dual 
carbs, per the library and list help I was able to get the 1800 from the 
basement running okay. 
Trying to replace front left blinker bulb, I found the flood line. Water came 
exactly half the way up the reflector .
On ever increasing test rides of a few miles, past a particular spot where I 
can get the bus up to 4th, before too long it pops out of 4th, reminding me 
of my 66, where I had to have Wing replace 'worn sychros' as he put it for a 
couple hundred. So the Transmission came out of the bus after work today, and 
another one came out of the basement. This one appears to a 3 rib 002 which 
definitely came out of a 72-74. Unfortunately the input shaft looked a little 
longer, and upon
closer examination the input sleeve &amp; TO bearing were damaged, and upon 
removing those, the input shaft is loose and can be pulled freely in the 
trans. 
So now I have 2 002s in the street and a motor on a jack as it gets dark. 
I assume those transmissions are cooked. 

So I have a 091 from a 78 that I've been saving. I have a rusty 80 vanagon 
starter which might work with the 78, if it works at all. I might try to just 
swap my 002 bellhousing and goodies onto the 091 so I don't have to take the 
motor off the jack to change the flywheel or take a chance on rusty vanagon 
starter, as I have a new 002 starter. Will keep you posted.
