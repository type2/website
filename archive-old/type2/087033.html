&gt; All this talk of T4 buses has me scared witless... It

don't be, the engines are at the basics very much the same,  the biggest
thing to consider is that the T4 engine is quite a bit heavier.  but it
comes out the same way just be aware of the weight and follow the
directions and you won't have any more problems than the rest of us...the
general concensus is that you take out manual tranny engines and trans
together, and an automatic is removed seperately from the trans.

&gt; took 6 hours with me and a guy that works on american
&gt; cars to pull and install a T2 engine in a 68 Westy.  I
&gt; have a chance to buy a pair of T4 buses, one needs to
&gt; have the engine/trans of the other.  I am not sure
&gt; that I am up the the task of swapping the T4s... I
&gt; guess if I buy, then I will learn.  Thanks for the
&gt; posts on this topic, it is educational.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So here I sit.. dirty, tired and greasy, with my
&gt; &gt; engine half out of my 
&gt; &gt; &gt; bus.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm stuck, I'm cursing at myself loudly, and I
&gt; &gt; think I might have 
&gt; &gt; &gt; called the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I managed to pull the engine as far as I can to
&gt; &gt; the rear apron. and now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looking between the engine and trans I see (a
&gt; &gt; mile I guessed in anger) the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; input shaft seemingly has gotten longer... or
&gt; &gt; its coming out of the trans.
