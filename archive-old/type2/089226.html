Subject: Re: [T2] rear brake adjust, but which way?

Both screws are right hand thread. Look at the threaded section in the hole.
The star will always be at the center. The treaded section is always pointing
to the shoe. Visualize a bolt in a nut. The head of the bolt is the brake
shoe. The nut is the star. Hold the head of the bolt and turn the nut. One way
the head [shoe] will
closer to the nut [star]. Turn it the other way and the shoe moves out. In the
bus, you have to move one star in one direction, the other star in the
opposite direction.

&gt; Hey all.  Which direction does one turn the adjustment stars to bring
&gt; the brake shoes closer to the drum?
