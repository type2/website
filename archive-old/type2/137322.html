Subject: Re: [T2] Definitely a Friday topic

A back-authorized bus song: Jessica (Allman Brothers) is the music that 
plays in &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; when Kevin Kostner drives to Boston to pick 
up Darth Vader. The movie used the studio version (from &quot;Brothers and 
Sisters&quot;) but I strongly recommend the version on the much later live 
album with Warren Haynes. The tune slips into a short fast version of 
&quot;Mountain Jam&quot; and otherwise kicks.
