Subject: Re: [T2] motor question...

Soak the cylinders with light oil like 3in1 oil. Other options would be ANY oil you have diluted with a bit of mineral spirits to thin it. 

Took me several days but I freed my Corvair engine this way. Each day I would try to rotate it a little eack way and after  acouple days, it broken loose and after 1 more it would rotate. In it runs good these days.

I have heard stories of dragging the car around with a tractor with the gear shifter in 2nd... Dunno if I would do this or not... &lt;grin&gt;
