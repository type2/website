Subject: Re: [T2] Starting This Year's First Unending Heater Thread

Justin
          Where are you located?  I've got a BA6 I bought for my Split
Window Bus and decided it's just to big to fit it.  I've got $100 in it and
will let it go for that.  Of course shipping would be extra.  All I know
about it is the guy I bought it from said it worked when it came out of the
Bus it was in.  Doesn't mean much I figured it was worth it for the parts if
nothing else.  All the controls and stuff seems to be there.

        I to was looking at the Propex propane heaters but after shipping
from UK that's a lot for a heater.
