Regarding the recent comments about Bondo: Bondo is a brand name that has
become the generic term for body fillers, like Kleenex has for tissues.
IMHO, Bondo is crap. However, there are several fillers that are excellent.
Metal-2-Metal  and Claw Glass are two that I've used with great success. To
make my point, a local auto body supply store (Mattos) carries the two
brands I mentioned, they do NOT sell Bondo. Pep Boys, Trak Auto, Wal Mart,
etc., carry Bondo. That ought to tell you something right there. I think too
many people freak out when they see filler was used, thinking it is all
&quot;Bondo&quot;.    Jeff
