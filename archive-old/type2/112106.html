Subject: looking for help in s. eastern missouri

Hi.
My name is Luke and I've just purchased a '72 bus from
a well know bus head named Joe Fournier. I was heading
back home to Chicago when the engine caught fire. The
bus is now in a tow lot in Sikestion Missouri. I'm new
to the bus community and am looking for someone close
by that could give me some advice and maybe some help.
I need to know what to do with the bus, an educated
guess on the cost of repair, and a place to store the
bus for about 2 weeks. Joe told me to look for help on
type2_dot_com and here is my plea. Any help would be
greatly appriciated. thanks for your time.
Peace, Luke
