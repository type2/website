&gt; Dear All,

&gt; I have quite a few brittle wires in my engine bay and it seems that
&gt; any that do not have an extra shrouding are the ones that are
&gt; suffering. Can anyone suggest a suitable shroud / conduit for the
&gt; wires? I can use conduit from a hardware shop but ......?!?

Electrical tape makes a good wrap for wires, but it won't heal insulation
that is already brittle.

You can also get split wiring loom material at your local FLAPS or off of
cars at the wrecking yard.  I prefer tape over the plastic loom as it
looks more original.
