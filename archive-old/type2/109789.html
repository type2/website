&gt; Folks, can some of you with 78's look at this picture.

&gt;
&gt; and verify the 2 black screws? on the door both above and below
&gt; the vent on the trailing edge of the door?

*I* can verify those screws are there,, I just looked at the picture and
can see them for sure!

I am not sure what your asking, but I happen to have a pair of those door
panels here,, and they have the same screws .. look the exact same as the
photo link above.

Does that help?
