Subject: Brake Booster Valve

I accidently broke my brake booster valve while trying to remove the old 
hose...I called my local Foreign Aide and they said they did not stock 
them...Try a junk yard...
First of all, why the heavy duty hose?  I was trying to remove this hose 
from the valve and it punctured a nice size hole in my finger.  Is it 
mandatory that I replace this hose with the same material or will regular 
vacuum line work?
Lo
