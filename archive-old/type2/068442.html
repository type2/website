Hi Rodney,

Although I don't drive to work my bus doesn't get a lot of long runs
particularly in Winter. Eventualy like your's my battery starts to get 
sluggish.

I know from my ammeter that, after a lot of short runs (under 10 
mins) over several weeks/months, I've got to drive at least 100 miles 
before the needle goes right back to zero.

So here's what I've done for those days when my starter goes whir, whir,
click. :-(

I have an auxilliary battery in the engine compartment of my 'loaf'. 
When I bought it I made sure it had a cranking power at least the same 
as my driving battery. I also fitted a substantial earth strap.

The auxilliary battery is charged up while driving by a 'second battery 
relay' as used for towing a caravan/trailer, and is used for radio,
lights etc while camping.

Between the two battery positives I have fitted a HEAVY duty relay which
I bought from a Ford car breakers. This is the relay used between 
battery and an inertia starter motor so is cabable of taking the 
starting current.

I chopped up a pair of cheep jump leads to connect the battery positives
one to each side of the heavy duty relay switch. A light cable takes a 
constant live to a switch in the cab and back to activate the heavy duty 
relay. Take the supply from the aux battery because when you want to use
the switch your driving battery will be flat.

Now when I turn the key and get the dreaded whir, whir, click turning the
switch in the cab on gives the desired whir, brmm.

Basicaly the heavy duty relay buts the two batteries in parrallel as you 
would do in a standard jump start (even supplies an accurate 12 volts 
for those worried about their FI systems).

To remind me to turn the &quot;jump start&quot; switch off I've fitted a buzzer. 
To reduce voltage loss to the heavy duty relay and to enable use of a 
light wire from front to back I've fitted a &quot;no voltage loss&quot; relay as 
described in Muir for the standard starter relay.

This system gets me going and when I get home I take my driving battery 
out and give it a mains charge.

Bob
