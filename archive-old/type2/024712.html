Listees,

While injecting water may give some additional power (allthough its main
purpose was to cool the incoming charge of fuel and air), high humidity is
already vaporized (as opposed to atomized) and no expansion will occur.  My
guess is that humid days are generally cooler and therefore the air is more
dense.  That's why turbo chargers work, they pack more in the cylinder per
intake stroke.  I know all about how hot it can be with high humidity.  It's a
relative thing.  I notice that my bus runs better on cool days vs. hot days
(once it gets warmed up ;-)
