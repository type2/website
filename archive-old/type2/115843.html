&gt; 7.5BTDC means 7.5 on this scale right?

&gt; If so, the scale jumps from 6 to 12 with only one mark between the two.
&gt; How am I supposed to time my motor at 7.5 with such a huge non-specific
&gt; area to work with?

Even the correct scale isn't an very accurate way to do it. I remember
timing mine to 7.5 and the smog referee insisted it was really 9 degrees but
I couldn't argue.

I really want to hook up to that flywheel sensor and compare the phase of
the spark to that sensor to accurately do it. Future project...

&gt; I have been timing it at that mark by the number 6, but that dimple is
&gt; before the 6, which I am guessing now is just because the dimples don't
&gt; mean squat, or that is for 5BTDC for motors up to 74/75 but not after,
&gt; which is what mine is.

I don't think any bus was timed 5 BTDC.

&gt; There is no dimple after the 6 where 7.5 would be somewhere in that area
&gt; between 6 and 12.

I bought a spare scale a few months ago so I could paint the marks white for
readability.

On it are dimples at 7.5 BTDC, 5ATDC and 10ATDC. There is also a square
notch between 26 and 28 VOR.
