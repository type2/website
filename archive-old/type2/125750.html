Subject: Re: [T2] motor question...

He means H case is a 66 block, used in both T1 and T2. It is a single
relief case as well. 
I think the deep studs started in 1973 with the AH cases?


&gt; a good year for the beetle motor??? 
&gt; 
&gt; Hello Jim   Well you got some answers to freeing it up but not to this ??  Is 
&gt; it a H block which is what was in a 68 bug then the motor had some problems  
&gt; weak alloy in the block wouls cause   these cases to crack and pull the heads
