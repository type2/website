Subject: Re: Pushrod tube seals?

Hi Chris,
Interesting that your '76 2.0L has an EGR filter interference problem in 
removing the pushrod tube, because I didn't have that problem when I did 
mine recently on a 1.8L '75. I suspect you'll have to remove the filter, but 
that is not a very difficult task. Bolts and nuts at the exhaust end might 
be rusty, but the bolts at the egr valve connection thread into the valve 
proper.
Roland
