&gt;I checked out some of the info on finishing the roof rack.
&gt;
&gt;I called two galvainizing places, they both were around $60/100 lbs. One
had a minimum of $65, the other $125. That includes blasting and prepping
the surface. A lot cheaper than I envisioned. Any one have any idea how much
a rack weighs, I imagine it has got to be less than 100 lbs.
&gt;The rack I have is the all metal rack, tubing type, with 5/8&quot; tubes. 7'x4'
&gt;
&gt;I also called some powder coating companies. They gave me a ball park
figure from a description over the phone-$125, including blasting. 
&gt;
&gt;Here are some of my options:
&gt;Hot dip galvanized and then powder coated:-I was told that the finish would
not be very smooth this way, due to the roughness of the the zinc coating.
How rough I am not sure. 
&gt;
&gt;Hot dipped Galvanized:I guess this was the original way to do it, it lasted
about 35 years, so why not try again.
&gt;
&gt;Zinc-Rich Primer then Powder Coating:This zinc rich primer is similar to
galvanizing, but it is painted on, and is probably not as good protection
from rust. On the other hand, it should leave a smother finish. The powder
coating people told me this would add about 30% to the cost of the process.
&gt;
&gt;Powder coating:I think I would avoid just powder coating, as tough as this
finish is, I don't know hoe well it would stick to the intricate parts, or
sharp edges.
&gt;
&gt;Lastly:Door handles
&gt;My door handles have some pitting on them, and I was considering getting
them re-chromed. I have gotten some estimates over the phone-somewhere
between $15-45/handle. Althoug I have been cautioned about the pitting. Has
anyone had there handles re-chromed. Does the pitting look bad. I guess I
would like to have a nice finish, but it doesn't need to be &quot;show quality&quot;.
And I would like it to last a while. Am I better off just buying new
handles(Can I just buy new handles?)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any info, suggestions, or experiences doing similar stuff.
&gt;

  From the top . . don't think you asked the platers if they had
a tank big enough for your rack . . the 4' X 7'  . . .

 Doubt if they have one . . most zinc plating is on small parts. .

 I looked this up one time, you get to hear what I remember . .
Zinc plating (hot) is put on by the ounce per square foot . .
They will talk of 1 oz. or 2 oz. . . . 1oz. is equal to 1.4 mils
by recall and is good for about 7 years of average exposure. . .
Pretty sure it passes 100 hours of salt spray test . .
 Two ounces are probably good for 14 years . . 

 Now I skip to the bottom of your post and cover the chrome plating.

Chrome plate is only part of the process . . . first the part is 
cleaned and the given a copper plate . . for conductivity . .
 This is also where they polish and primp your part. . . if it is
pitted they polish and replate with copper till the pits are gone.

 From here on there are two processes  I know of . . 
The old way where you nickel plate and then chrome over that. . . 
The new process uses a &quot;trivalent chrome&quot; everything in one coat . .

This latter is said to be a bit darker than the old way . .

Once the part is chromed, it is polished again and is now ready 
to dazzle you . . .

In both cases, one coat of chrome is not the haps . . have to have
multiple coats to get good protection . . think they are touting
&quot;triple chrome plating&quot; . . . .

A fair representation would be the cheap chrome bumpers we buy ..

They are probably single chrome and are rusting before you get them 
out of the store . . . 

 Bottom line here is if you have pitted parts, unless they are the
only ones in the world, you are better off getting a new set . .
 This filling and polishing and filling gets expensive . .

 The Powder Coating . . .  haven't got a lot of experience with 
it but here's the basics from what I've read and seen . .

They put this stuff on off-road frames . . . because while being 
thick and impervious to &quot;most . . &quot;, it is still soft enough to 
take a rock hit without chipping . .

 I put it on my axle shafts for that reason . .

If it chipped, you could make a good case for the zinc under it . .

 Some question of whether it would get in all the nooks and 
crannies . . . it's an electo-static process . . with a negative charge on
the gun and a positive on the part, the particles of powder
are sucked right into every corner etc . . .  it's good at this . .

 This powder coat is baked at 450 deg. or some'at . . . so any fill
or repair should be done with metal as opposed to say &quot;bondo&quot; . .
As far as &quot;sharp corners&quot; . . get rid of them . . they do not lend
themselves to any kind of coating . . . .

 Bottom line here, and only my opinion, the powder coat will last
you longer than the van . . :-) won't require a coating under it.

 I might add there are many types of powder coating and not even 
the guy who does the work for me knows what he's using, believe it
is just a &quot;vinyl&quot; . .  acetone will do it in . . we will always
be at the mercy of the unscupulous . .  so ask around . . .

I get a better deal from the powder-coater if he's already got that 
&quot;color&quot; (the only option I have) in the gun . .
 A pair of axle shafts were only $20 . . . 

 He was doing a pair of fuel tanks for some big-rig along with my
little axles . .

 Have you had enough ?  . .  :-)
