Subject: Anyone know their Chassis numbers?
Message-Id: &lt;v03110701b42addc2ad5a_at_[209.214.195.131]&gt;

This is getting stupid, someone please confirm i'm not mad.............

Bear with me, I know numbers are boring. Just for the books, my chassis
number starts with
235, 2 = Type 2, 3 = Kombi/camperwagen and the 5, I am to understand means
the '5' in
1965.
The rest of the number is 076 845.

My Splitty DVLC owners document says it's a 73 or a 78 (can't remember *:-)
) Kombi 7
seater.
I phoned VW in Milton Keynes asking for the production date and they sent
me a letter
saying &quot;we are writing to confirm that your vehicle was manufactured 18th
December 1964.
Finally, VW in Wolfsburg received my 10Dm and returned a certificate saying
that it was
built on 16th December 1964 and left the factory 6 days later on the 22nd.

How the hell can this be? - the chassis number says it's a late '65, the
registration
plate says it's a '65. So who's wrong? and do I now just give up as
everyone that should
know the facts disagree with each other, and all seem to be a year out?

Any light shed would be gratefully received.

Thanks,
Paul Edwards.
