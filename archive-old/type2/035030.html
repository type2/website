Subject: Re: new trans; won't shift

Don't sweat, I think it's not a problem.

If you have the engine out, it's likely your trans is sagging without proper
rear support:  You can't shift because it is twising the shift linkage in an
arc with the transmission drooping in the back.  Did you do anything to raise
it into position after taking out the engine?  The way I used to tow buses with
engines out is to use a heavy chain under the trans attached at each side to an
available spot on the frame bracing (this was on a 71).  But by the time you
put your engine into the bus you should use an adjustable jack so you can raise
that tranny up and down until you can fit the engine straight into it as you
reinstall it.  If you don't know how, it's tricky until you realize the
alignment of the trans to engine bell housing must be carefully matched, using
both the engine jack to bring the engine in over the rear mount and the
transmission jack to bring the trans rear up.  In the case you used a block or
box to support the trans while you pulled the engine, it's now too low as the
car has lifted up without the weight of the engine and trans.

&gt; This may be premature, but I'm worried.
&gt;
&gt; Last year, I pulled the engine and trans from my '71 Westy. I bought a
&gt; (partially) rebuilt trans from someone who used to be part of this list but
&gt; who will go unnamed at this time.   I replaced all three shift rod
&gt; bushings, greased the shift rods, and mounted rods and trans in the Westy.
&gt; Fast forward many months to Saturday.  The engine rebuild is all but at a
&gt; standstill. Like most other folks, finding a few minutes of garage time is
&gt; not easy.
&gt;
&gt; To whet my apetite, I sat in the driver's seat on Saturday, stared out the
&gt; windshield trying to remember how it was to actually drive a Westy, and
&gt; then tried to move the shifter through the gears. No luck.  It won't engage
&gt; in any of the five &quot;slots&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; I had hoped to make it through life without learning about transmissions.
&gt; Can anyone suggest a reason for the lack of movement?  If I pull the trans
&gt; and remove the bell housing, is there a quick fix?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks, Jack
