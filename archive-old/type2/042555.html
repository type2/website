Subject: late model bus parts FS

parted 69: nose clip w/ some roof sheet metal, front doors, slider, rear 
hatch, all with glass.  rear bench, misc. interior, lots of other misc. 
stuff.  email with needs, or buy whole thiing, perfect for restoring a bus.  
CHEAP, all parts must go or they will unfortunately be junked if i cant find 
somewhere to keep them.
