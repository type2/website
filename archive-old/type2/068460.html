You have brightened my morning!

Your lullaby idea - inverter give-away thing is DARLING!!!

Thanks for lifting my spirits on this C-c-c-c-c-old, gray, Sierra 
morning!

I'm always writing little songs about Her Majesty. Today, while we 
replace her front left slave cylindar, maybe I'll work on a little 
ditty for the contest... although I don't the little inverter unit.

Again, thanks for such a thoughtful little idea!
