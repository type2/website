Subject: Re: compression ratio

Maybe a little high. I like to keem mine under 7:1 but
if you don't want to run spacers it would probably
work okay with 92 octane. Personally I like to run 92
octane even with 7:1 compression. I fear the dreaded
detonation. I've burned down too many engines in the
Texas heat.

&gt;I am in the process of building a 1641cc with 
&gt;a c35 cam and 044 heads with dual solex 34's. 
&gt;Last night I checked deck height and after doing
&gt;the math came up with a compression ratio of
&gt;7:38.1. Is this good for the motor that I'm building
&gt;and can I run 87 octane with this ratio? TIA
