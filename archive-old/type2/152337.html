Subject: Re: Bench to bucket seat conversion?

You actually do have 1 bucket seat - the driver's side. The passenger side
of the 2/3 seat mounts the same way as the passenger side bucket seat.
There's 2 mounts where the back of the seat swivels and you will probably
need to weld in the inner mounting point because your existing (inner) one
is way over next to the driver's seat. Then you need to look at where the
top of the seat back hooks in. I don't remember whether the 2/3 seat uses
the latch in the same place but it might because I think there's 2 on your
seat so maybe the outer one is in the right place already.

&gt; Subject: Bench to bucket seat conversion?
&gt;
&gt; I've got a 72 transporter with a 1/3-2/3 split bench seat up front and I'd like to make the switch to two bucket seats.  Has anyone done this?  I don't have the bucket seats to look at so I'm not sure how much modification is necessary.  The only thing I know for sure is my spare tire currently sits under my front passenger seat so that'll have to go.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
