Subject: Re: [T2} help me!!! he cries.....intermittent loss of power

78, auto tranny stock FI except for Pertronix points eliminator.

at any speed and any time the engine loses power for a moment or a minute
then comes right back, when running it is dern near perfect.... but it has
this intermittent, and I have tried to find a pattern nada. it has never
even stalled, just no power... then back like new, will happen once oor a
dozen times while driving, at any speed, in any gear, in any throttle
position.


have

timed',
new fuel filter
checked connections
checked hoses
replaced coil
replaced timing advance vacuum unit (it did need that anyway)
checked plugs (all a nice grey color)
replaced dist cap and rotor
checked all electrical connections

need to check fuel presure
need to find my old .009 dist and stick in.

any other thoughts before I push it off a clift??  well maybe just a curb
but this has been driving me nuts for a couple months now.

Thanks
Bob
