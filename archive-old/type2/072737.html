I just got off the phone with Ray Gromer and we've decided to hold the
first annual &quot;Utah Busser's Ritual Sacrifice and Barbeque&quot; in about two
weeks at my house and garage.  Ray recently purchased Clay Perry's old
rusto westy and we are going to dismantle it, &quot;religiously&quot;  Come one, Come
all! Parts that he can't get rid of, we'll keep for the &quot;Utah Busser's
parts pool&quot; original inventory.

I'm supplying a steak dinner but it's BYOB.  Bring your wifes (if you have
em) let's make this a social event.  Please RSVP and tell us when is the
best date in about two weeks (Rays off to Colo, in the mean while).

Thanks,
Have fun
