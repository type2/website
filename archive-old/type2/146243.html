Subject: Re: [T2] Have you ever floored your motor?

Mike,

Well, while this is accurate and technically true, I know that EVERY
single automotive editor and publisher in the business will continue
to use the vernacular (motor) instead of the technically-correct term
of engine.

Auto techs (read: mechanics/wrench wranglers, etc.)...both young and
old...still refer to it as a motor. And this is what gives it
substance...since they are the ones who know what they're talking about.

Just my 2.781 centavos.

Your mileage (or interest in this subject) may vary.
