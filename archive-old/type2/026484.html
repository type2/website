I've been thinking about this whole heat recirculation thing lately.  The
general consensus of the both the type2 list and the 914 list is that the
auxilary heat blower really only provides additional air flow at idle or
slightly above idle.  After that, the force from the cooling fan overides
the force of the aux blower and may actually force the 'feed-back' flaps
(for lack of a better term) on the aux fan to close.  So, if this is the
case, a heat recirculation system feeding into the aux blower fan shouldn't
really make much difference.  What do you all think?
