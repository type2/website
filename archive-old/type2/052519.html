&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt;      Can anybody give me the procedure to adjust the spring tension in my
&gt; AFM?  It will go no leaner then 2.5% CO with the ajustment screw.   I have
&gt; looked in the archives but not found it.  Any help would be appreciated.
&gt; Thanks.

That's simple, tighter makes it leaner (more air volume for the same
electrical signal).
