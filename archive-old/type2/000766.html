&gt;Where are all the buses in Holland?

I've got one that left Holland!!!

A '72 Westy that was imported into New Zealand about 15 years ago. It's a
bit of a novelty here as a left hand drive vehicle in a country of right
hand drive cars. Having only had one previous owner is also one of it's
claims to fame. She's got a bit of surface rust and the paints faded a bit,
but she ticks along just fine. Loaded up with the wife and three children
(all under 5) we look like modern day hippies, which is a nice change after
a week wearing a collar and tie!
