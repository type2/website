&gt; &gt; I have not noticed significant differences
&gt; &gt; between the 185 and 205 tires,
&gt; &gt; but it has been a long time since I used the
&gt; &gt; narrow tires
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; My only concern is that I'm not aware of any
&gt; 205's that have sufficient max pressure or max
&gt; load, since the Michelin MXT's left the market.

I have a complete set of what may be the last batch of MXTs but I thought
the Aglis 61? were comparable.  

&gt; Remember that any of the P rated 205/75/14, which
&gt; is all of them to my knowledge, must have the max
&gt; load reduced to 91% to compare it to the spec
&gt; 185R14C or 185R14Rf.  In other words the tire
&gt; should still have max pressure of at least 45 and
&gt; a max load in the 1700 range and load index of
&gt; 94-95. I don't know of any close to this.  

yeah mine are rated load index of 99S, think the weight rating is 1980 or
so....but they still only run ?43psi??  (from memory)

no tire sag and I'm probably loaded pretty close to the limit.  great
tires but not cheap
