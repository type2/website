&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;yep, however I can't remember the last time I've seen one of em work,
&gt;  &gt; I have a new bottle since mine leaks like a sieve, if this doesn't work
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt;      One thing I have not seen yet is you pump it up to 42 PSI. And mine
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  at a LOT less than 42psi I have a front seat sprinkler system!!!!

Oh come on folks,

Its not difficult to get the standard washer system working. 

In the UK our annual inspection includes the washers so the 26000  loaf/bay 
transporters still on the road have them working on at least one day of the 
year.

If the water comes out on your feet then its likely that the tube is 
perished. If your flaps don't sale it then buy some from the local tropical 
fish shop as its the same size as aquarium air lines.

If the valve on the switch is bust then buy a second hand one at the next VW 
rally/swop meet you attend or scrap yard you visit cost about 50 cents. Or 
maybe $1.50 if you take the complete switch.

If the bottle is cracked then fix it with some supper glue.

If the bottle won't hold pressure then check the air valve is screwed in 
properly or replace with a new one - they are the same as the valve cores for 
your tyres available at any FLAPs.

The real problem is if the rubber tube for pressurising the bottle is 
perished as the are difficult to find in good condition even from scrap yards 
or swap meets.

If thats the case then remove the valve core so that air can easily flow into 
the bottle, remove the valve on the column switch and replace it with a micro 
switch (from Radio Shack etc) which you can mount onto the switch with a 
little bracket made from a scrap of baked bean tin (or any other tin) and 
connect up to a windscreen washer pump (from your flaps). I did this on my 
'73 and VW have done this on my new T2 which has a similar column switch 
layout to a 74-79 bus; so theres definitely room to do this while keep in 
stock appearance.

Oh, to stop the water seeping back to the bottle through the washer pump fit 
a aquarium non return valve into the line to give instant response to the 
washer arm being pulled.

Good luck
