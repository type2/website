Subject: RE: Cargo holder

Got no bites on this thing first time around. Giving it one more shot.

        I have a 50&quot;w x 71&quot;l x 16h wooden box. It is waterproof and is mounted to two &quot;Thule&quot; roof 
racks. It fit right on the gutters of a '77 bus. It has a locking hasp and can hold approx 26 cu. 
ft. of cargo. I'm not looking to rip anyone off, but at the same time I don't want to get screwed 
either. I called an RV place got a price for a typical storage unit approximately the same size. I 
think it should be worth between $200-$300 dollars. The racks alone I know are expensive.

        I can mail a Word 6.0 document showing wht it looks like to anyone who may be interested.

        Any advice to the worth of this thing would be greatly appreciated.

Thanx,
