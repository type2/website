&gt; good oil, though!! At least I guessed Amsoil;-)

&lt;snip&gt;

I feel that synthetics are superior oils when run in an engine that is
designed for them.  Most aircooled VWs are not designed for
synthetics. Lack of filtering by itself makes synthetics uneconomical,
and the vertical parting lines of VW cases and the penetration
tendancy of synthetics often leads to oil leaks.  Add a filter,
tighten up the engine sealing, and adjust the running clearances for
synthetic and it's a winner.

I've been leery of the amsoil brand for several reasons.  First, it is
only available through amsoil's MLM distribution system.  In MLM
systems, the way for distributor to succeed is to induce others to
sell the product for them and to induce others to distrubute and so
on.  It's a reasonably legal pyramid scheme that results in a very
unstable set of retailers.  The disadvantage of this becomes apparent
when you need oil on the road and discover that the local distributor
has switched to selling Avon or Tupperware!

Another beef that I have with amsoil is that they allow their
distributors to abuse mailing lists and newsgroups in order to market
their product.  Some distributors post virtual copies of their
marketing literature whenever an oil topic comes up.  The literature
contains lots of emotional hype like &quot;The pour point of our oils blows
away conventional oils...&quot;, but little information of real value to
the group.

It seems to me that if amsoil was such a clearly superior product, I
would be able to go down to the local FLAPS and buy a case.  Since
amsoil intentionally avoids normal distribution channels I cannot do
so and I'll buy products made by a more reputable company.
