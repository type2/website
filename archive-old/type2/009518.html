It sounds like you are missing the lower tin betreen the engine case and
the heater boxes.  These are important for proper thermosat functioning. 
We sell those if you need them.  You should also have two small pieces of
cooling tin just above the push rod tubes.  

The pre-bent metal fuel line is also available new.  Make sure to put a
rubber grommet where it passes through the tin.

 Hey. After a year of searching I finally bought my first bus-
 a 1970 hardtop camper. Another listee came to check it out
 (thanks Chris!) and showed me where the heat riser tin is gone.
 Also the engine compartment seal is in need of replacement.
 You might guess that it is running hot. I will be ordering a seal
 soon. Does anyone have spare tin for the heat risers?
 
 I was doing the valves yesterday and noticed that I could see
 the cooling fins on all of the cylinders from underneath. Is this
 right? Am I missing some key cooling tin?
 
 Also, I want to replace the metal fuel line that passes through
 the firewall. I can see etch marks where it has been rubbing :^O
 Is a pre-bent fuel-line available, or does one have to fabricate
 it out of a generic piece? I checked bus depot and could not
 find it.
 
 thanks...
