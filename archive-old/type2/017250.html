Go to the junk yard and you should be able to purchase gages and sensors for
very reasonable prices.  I recently picked up a volt meter gage, oil temp gage
and the oil temp sensor, out of a wrecked VW GTI, for $20.  I tapped the
cyllinder head (by the #1 cyll - sheet metal mounting hole) to fit the oil temp
sensor, fabbed a bracket to hold the gages to the bottom of the dashboard and
now have complete gaging for Bullwinkle (previously I had installed an oil Temp
gage and Vacuum gage) :-). BTW the oil temp stays fairly constant regardless of
load (~185F in the winter --I have yet to see the effects of summer) while the
cyllinder head temp varies quite a bit - steep grade the gage may read ~120C,
down hill ~80C.

&gt;       in the coming months of summer, i am kinda worried about my running
&gt; temp. I'm tryin to figure out how much is involved in installing an oil
&gt; temperature gauge on my van. I'm just concerned with finding out my options
&gt; now. Do i have to remove the engine, or can it be done in the car? I also
&gt; figured since i was goin through with that, i might get an assortment of
&gt; gauges, but dont have all that much to invest. I just want to be safe in
&gt; knowing the norms of my engine, and when they arent at the norm.
