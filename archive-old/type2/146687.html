Subject: Re: [T2] Where is the engine supposed to be?

&gt;I just broke a cable inside the bowden tube myself so I'm wondering what's
&gt;wrong with my setup...
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
Well, it's seeming like I have too much flex in it.  I'm going to try 
and find my old bowden tube (which I vaguely remember being slightly 
shorter) and see if that gets rid of the problem.  I'm also going to put 
more grease in there, too.

What also bothers me is that I &quot;lose&quot; all these threads when I'm 
tightening the cable.  It's like the cable should be slightly shorter so 
that there are more usable threads.  I'm already screwed all way down to 
the solid metal...
