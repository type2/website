&gt;  i finally took the bus to local vw expert yesterday.
&gt;  i got some bad news.  he came to the conclusion that
&gt;  the brain may be bad.
&gt; unfortunately i start college in 10 days and need a dependable vehicle to
&gt; get me to and from school and work, so i'm gonna have to let her go.


I have Bosch ECU's (&quot;brains&quot;) for $99.95 (for '76-78 models).  These are new
(factory rebuilt) Bosch units in original Bosch packaging (that normally
sell for close to $500).  It would be a shame to give up the van over a $100
part.
