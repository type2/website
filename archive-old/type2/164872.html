Subject: RE: [T2] RE: removing rubberized undercoated on the
  undercarriage

Also baking soda blasting will do the same as dry ice. Very cool stuff.

I will never sandblast any bus again. I'm still getting sand in my battery
trays after a year.

Sam,

Try to find someone who can blast with dry ice (takes some special
equipment). Not cheap, but you don't have to worry about sand getting into
the wrong places, it takes off dirt, undercoating, rust, and loose paint,
but it will NOT damage good paint under the undercoating.
