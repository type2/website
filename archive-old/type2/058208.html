Subject: Coupling Disc Safety Alert

Hello All,
Found a pretty obscure part this weekend on my bus
that could fail in a catastrophic way.  I checked
the archives and I could not see that it had been
brought up before.  Anyway, skip the rest of this
if you already know about the ^Ócoupling disc^Ô, and
are sure yours is ok.  Recent  posts last week on
checking for rust where your steering box meets
the frame got me under the bus this weekend
(thanks, really appreciate the info this list
provides).  No rust but I did find my ^Ócoupling
disc^Ô cracked all the way thru around the bolt
holes.  This is a rubber, square shaped disc about
¼ inch thick.  If this broke completely I would
not be able to steer my bus.  I checked Bently
this is found on 68 to 74 busses (maybe more but I
am not sure).  Anyway grab a flash light and
laying on your back nearer the drivers side front
of the bus look for the steering box. On my 74 I
don^Òt have to remove the pan to see this part.  As
you look up you should see the place where the
steering column connects to the steering box,
there is a rubber ^Ócoupling disc^Ô there and you
should be able to get a few fingers on it, to push
and prod it for cracks.  Never heard of one
failing but I won^Òt be driving my bus until I
locate another one and fix it.  I am hoping I
don't have to remove the steering box, but I
usually find the most difficult way of doing
things.  Thanks all -  and happy bussing.
