&gt;Well... that makes your van worth somewhere between $7K and $11K, 
&gt;doesn't it? From the description, I'd say closer to the latter price. It 
&gt;must be reassuring to know you can get your money back, if you decide to 
&gt;sell... and can find anyone who'll pay those prices.

I _paid_ $7k for my '54!!  I was hoping more like $40k when restored.

&gt;BTW, I'd like to shake the hand for anyone who'd pay &gt; $10K for some of 
&gt;these vans.

There's sposed to be a deluxe for sale in the Land of No Rust for $60k
