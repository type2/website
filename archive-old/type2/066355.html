&gt;&gt;Hey All:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I just checked out a '72 (Deluxe?) van that was converted when new to a camper
&gt;&gt;by Contempo Camper somewhere in CA. It has a double bunk upstairs, but this
&gt;&gt;isn't a pop-top. It has a permanent fiberglas shell that adds about 32&quot; to the
&gt;&gt;height of the van (the only really negative thing about this van).
&gt;
&gt;I thought that too when I first laid eyes on Bluto (my '73 hightop) but now
&gt;I am really glad I got it instead of a poptop.  It has more (badly needed)
&gt;storage than a pop top, you can ALWAYS stand up in it, setting up camp is
&gt;faster (and you can sleep in rest stops without it being obvious), and it's
&gt;more weather resistant (no canvas to tear or leak).  Of course, there are
&gt;some disadvantages too, but I've learned to live with them and I think the
&gt;benefits far outweigh them.  The biggest problem is it keeps the bus from
&gt;fitting into most garages.  I haven't noticed that it is any worse in the
&gt;wind than a poptop Westy, and it still gets good gas mileage.  One other
&gt;benefit - you don't see them on the street everyday.  The camper you're
&gt;looking at has got to be pretty rare.  I hope you'll consider keeping it as
&gt;is instead of stripping it if you decide to buy it.  :/

I am really happy with my hightop as well.  It is a Contempo Camper and is the
exact same set up William described.  Over the past two years that I have owned
my van I have seen two other vans in the Vancouver area that were mirror images
of mine, same orangey red/white color scheme and everything.  One had a big
Coca-Cola sticker on the sliding door.  I also know a guy with a similar hightop
near my house.  He removed the hightop and replaced it with a pop-top.  I don't
know why.  Now it looks like a common Westy.  I hope everyone doesn't do this to
their hightops.  They are unique.

Save the hightops!
