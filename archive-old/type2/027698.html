Hi Everybody,
   Had a great time this past weekend at the first Limbo On Long Island.  23 
buses from 6 states for a first time event, not bad!  Thanks to the Long 
Island Bus Alliance, and more specificlly Andrea and Brad R.  I did see one 
other listee, Mike B. from New Jersey, where were the rest of you?
   Anyway, on to the subject at hand.  I need new covers for the seat/bed, 
jump seat, and cushions in my 71 westy.  Does anyone have instructions on 
how to make them?  I recently made new curtains following someones 
instructions and am pleased with how they came out.  So of course that makes 
me wonder if I could make the seat covers too.  Any and all help would be 
appreciated
   If it appears beyond me, I wouldn't be opposed to buying the covers.  So 
any and all recommendations for vendors would be appreciated too.

Paul A.
Huntington Station, New York
71 westy - John Dear
