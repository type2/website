Subject: [T2] Looks Like Trouble

Hey Guys,

Returned this week from a couple of weeks in the field doing my part to
protect God, Country, Mom, and VW Camping in the Smokies.

Anyway, I come home to find my VW hurting.  The battery was dead, which was
a quick fix and a minor annoyance.

When I cranked Bess up, she blew a foamy oil looking stuff that smelled like
gasoline out the exhaust pipe.  I quickly turned her off and inspected
further.  Turns out that my Bus is leaking oil like a Hollywood Insider with
hot gossip.  She was completely out of oil and when I added the first quart
it began pouring out from where the cone you add goes into the engine.  How
difficult is this to fix?  What would the foamy junk coming out of the
exhaust be?  Am I in real trouble here or is this another minor thing?

Had to get away for a few hours before writing this.  Any of you ever had
that fifth or sixth consecutive problem that makes you seriously consider
selling the Bus?  I think I'm over that, but now I'm trying to realistically
assess how big of a problem I have and what it may take to fix this.

Until Later,

Darrin
