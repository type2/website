Subject: Re: [T2] paint jobs

Wet sanding will remove any irregularities in the paint, and will not
remove color blotches--that's forever in the pigment. 

But hold on for a minute--

Who painted the vehicle?
How much paint is on it?

After your done wet sanding, your going have to buff, and polish too,
removing more paint--
And to an untrained hand the buffer can be a demon--cutting into sharp
edges, leaving either bare metal or at best, shiney primer--
 
I'd would suggest leaving this job to a pro---
Wet sanding alone will not cure all your problems--but a combination of
sanding, buffing, and polishing will--

Later,

Terry

Does anyone out there know anything about &quot;water sanding&quot;? I've heard
that a much better final paint job can be gotten by doing this, although
it is very labor intensive.. But it is the kind of a thing that a
dedicated owner could do themselves. I guess it takes out all the
irregularities and blotches and gives a lovely, uniform sheen.
