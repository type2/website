Yes.  Compare your spring clips (a/k/a wire bail)  to a new one;  you'll
probably see the difference and it becomes apparent why they've lost
tension...

&gt; Hi People,
&gt; How can I stop my covers from leaking. The is a steady drip of oil from
both
&gt; covers.
&gt; I tried to fix the problem by replacing both covers and gaskets.. still no
&gt; luck.. would it be worth replacing the spring clips?
