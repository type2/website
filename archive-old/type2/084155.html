Subject: Re: [T2] Paint

Well said Hal.  I for one appreciate hearing that it's ok NOT to have a p=
ristine bus.  I have a friend who painted his Jimmy with Tremclad Black. =
 It too passes the 20/20 rule.  Although I don't think I'd do it to my We=
sty, I've often wondered about spray cans.  I guess it'd be pretty expens=
ive in cans.
I'm in the middle of a very busy time career wise and I'd love to have th=
e time to devote to a full strip-down of the Westy and redo the body the =
way I've seen some do on their Web Sites.  I'm amazed at how great they l=
ook.
I'd venture a guess that they are professional or are good friends with p=
ros and are in a situation that makes it a bit easier than most.  A situa=
tion they undoubtedly made a conscious decision to set up. I consider mys=
elf lucky to have a friend who has rebuilt a type 4 engine and I was able=
 to part out his old westy, engine included!  I gotta say that it's prett=
y cool to have someone in my life who likes VW's as much as I do.
For the time being, I'll do the best I can with my ex-mechanic skills, re=
pair what needs repairing, prevent what I can and maybe, just maybe, I'll=
 price out cartons of rattle cans.  Can you get sage green???

Thanks for listening...
