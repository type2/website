X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

 friend of mine owns a car dealer. He bought this set about 2 years ago. Due
to having all types of cars, he needed a full set metric and SAE. I have
asked him about it and he loves it. He has not broken any of the tools yet.
Now, these would not work for the Pro Mechanic, but I would love to have a
set to keep in the car. One set, smaller box, and if I run across a guy in
an old Ford broken down, I can help him too. The quality seemed to be better
than a Craftsman, but slightly less than that of a
Snap-on/MAC/Matco/Cornwell. 
This and $.50 will get you a can of Pepsi.

Volks,

I just got my JC Whitney catalog, and amongst the yummies, I spotted a 
metrinch tool set. Searched the library and the archives with no real hits. 
Anyone care to give me a &quot;road test impression&quot; on these?

For the price, I expect that I could buy both metric and inch sets, but the 
savings in weight and space (for the metrinch)is appealing.

I would want them to be just as effective as real metric tools, as my
teenage 
son would pack these as the only set in the bus. Of course, every need isn't

covered, so I would make up the missing items for his toolkit.

TIA and Cheers/Don Carron
