Hey All,
  I just had to let everyone know of a bit of good fortune
that I had last night. 
  I got a call from a guy that I did some work for, hehad a
Bus and sold it. The guy that bought it did not want all
the extra parts that he had, so he let me come and get
them. In the parts stash was 2 complete type 4 engines,
both 1800's. One has 1800 Carbed heads with the big valves
and the other came with a set of square ports off a 79, one
was shot. I also got a set of Weber 34ICTs and a set of
32-34PDSITs. I got complete exhaust systems including a new
muffler. Best of all, I got it all as payment for the favor
I did for him(lots of work, no money). 
   I now have 3 VWs and 11 Engines(3 type 4's,8 type 1-3).
