Subject: German Vs brazilian rubber items...

hello all,

I recently put 4 new ball joints on my 71 bus.  One was german, 3 were
brazillian.

Now 2-3 months later the german boot is completely split and
disintergrating and the brazilian one is fine.  

I have also heard many stories fo the german CV boots splitting after
short service and ones from NAPA lasting a good long time.

This experience has really ticked me off, now i have to disassemble my
front end to fix a brand new part.

My flaps got the german balljoint in fromt their supplier at the same time
the brazillian one came in.. so its not that it was sitting on their shelf
for a long time or anything....

My theory is that since germany last made busses in 1979, but brazil
currently has new busses available, and that the german parts are usually
much more expensive than the brazillian ones means that they sit on the
shelf a long time, or that they have been sitting in a warehouse for a
long time and the rubber stuff gets to you pre-disintergrated.

So, i think i am done with german rubber parts unless i know they have
been made recently.

Anyone else had this same problem?

peas,

Steve
