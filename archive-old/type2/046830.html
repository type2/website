Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Question

man, wish i could afford a $1500 bus, let alone a
$8,000 one:)  oh well, those nice, restored ones sure
are pretty, but my beater has gone 1/2 way across the
US and back twice, plus every little &quot;flaw&quot; usually
has a story behind it, makes the attachment for me
even better.   to each his own.   maybe if i get rich
one day ill buy a cherry one....nah!
happy friday
