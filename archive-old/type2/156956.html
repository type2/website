&gt; Our bus had a problem were it would run but would
&gt; stall out under the 
&gt; slightest load.  I though it was the fuel pump
&gt; because it went from 
&gt; being quite noisy to silence.  I put in a new fuel
&gt; pump but still hear 
&gt; nothing.  Also, there are two terminals on the fuel
&gt; pump, I have the red 
&gt; wire on the passenger side terminal and the brown on
&gt; the drivers side,  
&gt; Is this right?
If you look carefully end-on, molded into the bosses
that support the terminals are tiny + and - . They are
molded in whichever way you look at it - in other
words, on both top side and bottom side the way yours
is mounted. Bad way to ask the question as they can be
rotated any which way within the clamps. -BaH
