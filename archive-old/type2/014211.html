Subject: starting problem, thanks for the help!

Hello List,
 I just wanted to thank you for the help with the
problem that I have with m starter. I will try again
this weekend to get it running. I will check the
ground strap that you mentioned and try to figure out
what is causing the problem. Thanks again!!! You have
helped me once again.

David Kelly
