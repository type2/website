Nikki touched on a part that was important - taking off on hills.  How
many times have you seen even an &quot;experienced&quot; driver take off by rolling
backwards about 4 feet and revving the engine to get going? Totally
unnecessary.  What I do is keep a foot on the brake and let the clutch out
to the point the engine just starts to drop rpm.  Hold your clutch
foot there.  Next is foot off of the brake (no rolling!!!), foot on
the gas, and proceeding to let the clutch out in relation to your load 
and gravity pull.

I've mentioned this before and I've had people cry out, &quot;Oh the humanity
of it all.  OH NO!  You'll burn the clutch up!  Idiot!  Who taught you
this?!?!&quot;

Facts are that you do it quickly and it works great.  Works better than
rolling backwards 10 to 20 feet before going forwards.

Of course you can always cheat and use the ebrake - better for your clutch
that way.
