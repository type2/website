Subject: T4 oil leak

I dont have one on mine.. never caused a problem for
me............
-----------------------
 Should the oil drain plug on
a T4 motor have a washer (1977, original motor)? 
-----------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------
 I have an oil leak and it
looks like it's from around that plug and from the oil
filter
(new filter didn't help). 
---------------------------------------
1) Oil filter: Clean off mating surface real well
and apply new oil to the filter gasket.
2) Oil pressure sender: Look at it from the top hatch
and see if it is &quot;wet&quot; on top. If it is wet, replace
it..(cheap).
3) Oil cooler: *Bad &quot;o&quot; ring seals. You can get to it
by removing the fan shroud assembly. Not much fun.
**Just loose: retorque fasteners.
***Oil cooler is bad and sprung a leak. Could be
caused by
sticky cold bypass valve sticking and over pressuring
the cooler. bypass valve is easy to get to and check
out. Be sure to put it back in right side up!;-) 
Oh and to get the bypass valve out you will have to
take an old screwdriver and radius it as the slot
is not straight across like a normal slotted head.

Sooo any leaking on the drivers side of the engine
could be... Pressure sensor (hope hope).. oil cooler
(oh no!).. or the oil filter..

  Good luck
