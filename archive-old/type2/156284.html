&gt; I believe you'll see a signifigant jump in mileage with a SVDA distributor.
&gt; It advances the timing sharply at part throttle. The engine will definitely
&gt; &quot;feel&quot; better.

I made this switch and found no difference in mileage.  The drivability
was considerably better which makes the swap worth it.
