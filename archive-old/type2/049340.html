Karen, 
I'm more of an upright guy, but I'll give you two thougts. First the electric 
fuel pump is pushing hard enough to push gas past the needle and seats in the 
carbs. This will cause gas to drip out the carb overflows which is probably 
those vacum like lines you found.
Second, the gas that doesnt go out the overflows has to go someplace, in this 
case into your engine. The fact that it wont turn over sounds like hydrolock, 
i.e. you cant compress a fluid so nothing can turn. If this is the case you 
need to drain the oil and its easy to tell if your right because your oill 
will have a lot of gas in it. You dont want to try to turn over a hydrolock 
engine because something has to bend and it usually the rods. 
Sounds like you need to pull those clamps off those hoses, change the oil, 
and add a regulator to the fuel pump.
