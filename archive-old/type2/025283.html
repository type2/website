I went straight for the points this evening in my search to find the cause
of my abrupt engine failure yesterday.

I found the culprit to be the points had broken.  The little plastic piece
that rubs the dizzy shaft broke so the points slosed and stayed that way.

I sort of figured that was it.  Joe Fournier wrote me and raised the point
on the points.  The last time I changed my points I did not lube the shaft.
It was an emergency fix so I left that key element out intending to do it
later.

The local parts store did not have bosch, but the did have sorensen.  which
by the way have a strong, more solid looking plastic piece that looks as if
it would runs fine even if the shaft were bone dry.

I have never used anything other than Bosch, but until I get more points
made by them I will drive sorensen.  Does anyone have experience with these
points, shortcomings, etc.

Thanks for the suggested reasoning on the problem.

PS:  If there are any vanagon folks out there I need some assistance and
advice on an 85 weekender pop top.

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings and I hope you gained from the points
made here.
