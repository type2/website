&gt;  There's been some recent discussion on how Chilton manuals suck, while
&gt;  Haynes and Bentley are much better. But how does Bentley compare to the
&gt;  Haynes? I'm looking into buying one of them, but not sure which one to
&gt;  invest in. Any recommendations?
&gt;  

first let me start by saying that I have both Haynes and Bentley manuals and
 would not part with either of them.

secondly  I wish to state that as I have a 1973 RHD T2, with 1600 engine I can
 only speak about manuals for loaf/bay window busses.

I cannot comment on editions of manuals owned by other list members - only
 those which I own.

cost - Haynes £12, Bentley £25 (thats UK pounds) but Haynes splits T2s into 2
 books one for each type of engine, so if you have 2 busses you spend the same
 as for a Bentley.

Haynes is a UK publication so caters for all the RHD stuff (but frequently
 mentions other options). Bentley thinks all busses are LHD.

Haynes has volumes in litres and real pints/gallons. Bentley uses litres and
 the smaller USA pints/gallons.

The 1600 Haynes manual does not stop at 1971 but goes right through to 1979 so
 it includes my engine - Bentley thinks my bus was never made.
I don't have the T2/Type4 engine Haynes so I don't know how well it will cover
 all of the smog stuff found on later USA spec T2s

Haynes does not cover any camper stuff at all - Bentley mentions Westfallia
 parts where the conversion makes them an integral part of the vehicle (eg pop-
 top and louvered windows)
If you have a commercial (panel/pickup) then specific information is less
 likely to be in the Bently because of low numbers exported to USA.

Haynes has an index - Bentley splits the manual up into easily locatable
 sections and has a contents page at the beginning of each section.
It's easy to find what you want in both books.

Both books are easy to follow although one can often through light on what the
 other explains less well or skips. But both use the &quot;assembly is the reverse
 of disassembly&quot; line when a little more help could be usefull (eg putting the
 clips on front anti-roll bar clamps).

I read up a procedure in both books before starting.

I think if I lived in the USA I could manage with just the Bentley, but in the
 UK I must have a Haynes to cover my bus.

Good luck
Bob
