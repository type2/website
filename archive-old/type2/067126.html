Subject: RE: Hints on engine removal, '77 westy

Having just removed and installed my '77 westy's engine I have a few tips.
The manual I used foremost was Tom Wilson's &quot;How to Rebuild your Aircooled
VW&quot;  It is a great source and reasonably priced.  Secondly I used the Bently
manual.  A distant third was Muir (Admittedly a great reference but I find it
more useful for troubleshooting).
I used ramps to jack my car up with.  It worked great and gave a stable
set up to climb around under the bus.
Label all wires and hoses (there are actually less of them than I expected)
If you plan on removing the heads (for any reason) remove the exhaust system
before you drop the engine (it is a pain to get it off with the engine sitting
on the floor, I know!!)
Replace the clutch disk, pressure plate, throw out bearing, and pilot bearing.
Work slow (it took me forever to complete the project, ~2 months)
You should easily be able to drop the engine in one day.
Watch the fuel lines by the injectors when installing the engine.
Overall, it is pretty easy and you will learn so much about your bus in the 
process.
Good luck and have fun,
Brett
