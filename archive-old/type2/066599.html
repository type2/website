 ktgatlin observed about this post:

&gt;&gt; I have been asking questions about testing coils.  Now it is time to 
&gt;&gt; reveal the symptoms that lead to these questions and other recent 
&gt;&gt; events related.  I have been having the engine momentarily die on me 
&gt;&gt; for a while, just a split second of misfiring, I thought.

&gt;Why dont you just buy  a new coil and see what happens?

I don't know about most people, but I'm a bit tight in the 
money department.  And it's not like those T4 coils are the
Bosch BlueBoy $20 Special.  If I could find an inexpensive
way to rule out an unnecessary and quite costly repair, I'm
a-gonna use it.
&quot;Why not just buy a new transmission and see if that klunky
sound goes away?&quot;

Sounds like a repairman talking to me.
