Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch in my 79' Westy

On the late-model's with an upright, can't you drop the engine minus the 
shroud?  All you have to do is clear the oil cooler, and if you like, remove 
it as well.  You still have to jack it higher than a pancake, but not AS 
high.(?)

&gt;Last weekend I gained a whole new appreciation for the problems our
&gt;european brethren face, however.  Pat Flynn bought a euro-spec '75 double
&gt;cab with a 1600 DP motor in it.  No overhead access hatch and the upright
&gt;fan shroud.  What a pain getting the starter bolt off was!!!!  And I may
&gt;wind up gluing or duct taping the bolt to the starter as you suggest to
&gt;get it back in.  On a T4, that nut is right out in the open because the
&gt;fan shroud is not there, but it's gonna be unpleasant with the fan in the
&gt;way, I can tell :-)
