&gt; Dooes anyone know of a source for the nose of a 68-71? The cataloges
&gt; show early bus and post- 73, but nothing for these years.
&gt; Someone else mentioned that he took a '73-'79 front and relocated the
&gt; blinkers as that is about the difference between the pre and after '73.


I should soon have available complete new Danish made Bus noses for
somewhere between $100 and $150.  The deal isn't done yet (maybe 1-2 weeks)
but the price will be quite good and Dansk has a good reputation for
quality.  These noses have the upper turn signal location (a la 73-up) but
Dansk lists them as fitting all years '68-79.
