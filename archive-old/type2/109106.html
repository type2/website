Subject: Re: [T2] Collector/muffler indentification

From: &quot;Richard Atwell&quot; &lt;ratwell_at_mac_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I assume you have the triangle style flange heater boxes common to US
75-78 busses?

If you mean that it looks like a triangle with the top cut off (rectangle
with angled sides), yes.

&gt; There is a much simple design replacement muffler called an extractor...

I've already got a hitch, but this looks like a far simpler, and better,
setup than what I have now.

I got up under the bus a few minutes ago and took a closer look at the (much
cooler, thank you!) system.  It's a &quot;4 into 1&quot;.  The muffler ties into the
collectors just a few inches to the left of the hitch position (center).
The metal ring that holds the muffler to the upper of the two collectors
coming from the right-hand side broke loose from the muffler bracket, so
that explains the incessant tinkling sound.  I removed the ring and checked
for damage at the point on the collector where it was located.

At least there are no holes or leaks, so I'm assuming that the core of the
muffler is either shot, or it's one of those deep-throated deals that are
designed for sound.  My guess is the first problem, as the sound has gotten
increasingly louder as I've driven the bus.

Thanks for the part numbers.
