&gt; &gt; Thanks Jim,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just called the Time Fastener Co &amp; ordered the Timesert kit # 0127 for
&gt; &gt; repairing the tapered thread *for the oil sender* on the side of the
case.
&gt; &gt; I spoke with John * the owner* .  He knew exactly what was needed to
make
&gt; &gt; the repair.  Now it will be a permanent fix instead of trying to put
&gt; &gt; something on the threads to keep it from leaking.....
&gt;
&gt; Now this is great!  I hadn't heard of a fix for the sender hole short of
&gt; welding it up and redrilling!  Putting a pipe thread in a magnesium case
&gt; isn't the brightest thing VW has ever done!
&gt;
&gt; How is the insert itself sealed?  Is it a tapered thread, or is there some
&gt; sort of seat or sealant involved?  As I recall, Timeserts have little
&gt; drive-in pins that lock the insert, but they don't seem to be designed
&gt; with sealing in mind!

George, and List,

It's a tapered thread.  *there are no drive in pins* You put a little
lock-tight on the outside of the timesert before you put it in.  I opted to
buy the complete kit *$64.00* because I know I'll be doing more than just
one of these.....
