Subject: Re: [T2] Locking filler door

Steve,

I have done the filler door lock on a 67.

Go look at locks at the hdware store and pick and choose, biggest thing
to watch for is the amount of clearance between the lock arm and the
clearance for something to catch on inside the flap area.

Something like the locks available for tool chests is good.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Has anyone ever tried to find a locking gas cap for the 71 style. Actually
&gt; it appears that a locking gas cap can't be made for this type of filler. 
&gt; 
&gt; This leads me to my next question. Has anyone ever fabricated a lock for the
&gt; filler door?

&gt; &gt; Chris,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm not sure if the 71 is the same as my 73, but I found that some evil
&gt; &gt; previous owner had hammered up my filler spout pretty bad.  I had to
&gt; &gt; bend it flat and it sealed a little better.  I got a new locking cap
&gt; &gt; (Stant) and it sealed a little better yet (new sealing material) but I
&gt; &gt; still got some slosh-out on left hand turns.  That's when I got a
&gt; &gt; flashlight, don't use a match 8-) and found that there is a gradual
&gt; &gt; ledge that was bent over.  I used a paint can opener to grab the bottom
&gt; &gt; and bend it back into shape.  Now when I lock it down and twist a half
&gt; &gt; turn, it seals down nicely.
&gt; 
&gt; The '73 is different.  The '71 had that lovely big fill opening (you can
&gt; actually see the gas in the tank through it!) and the corresponding big
&gt; cap, which probably isn't available at the FLAPS.  The caps aren't all
&gt; that uncommon and should be available through VW suppliers or at swaps.  I
&gt; think that
&gt; they are the same as on early bugs, type III, etc.
