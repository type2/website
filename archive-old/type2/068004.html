&gt;I like the idea of the wide bottomed, lidded mug.  That way it will fit
&gt;nicely on the dashboard, within easy reach.  Plus, on those really cold
&gt;days, it can double as a windscreen defogger/deicer!  Just make sure it's
&gt;nice and hot.

I'm with you on this one. The kind that has the non-skid bottom, so I can
just put it down on the floor. I could have used one when I drove the 72
from San Francisco to Dallas! I'd definitely buy one.
