Subject: Re: [T2] Frustration sets in due to timing woes on 72 bus

Sounds like you still have dizzy troubles.  check oldvolks_dot_com, cross reference your dizzy with what is supposed to be on the bus and time it accordingly.  As I remember, the only dizzies that had 10 degrees ATDC was the dual vacuum ones. (both advance and retard).  Try a SVDA dizzy or even a 009 for the time being.  The SVDA's are timed at 7.5 BTDC with vacuum line attached.  Do you have stock Carburation?  Also you really must have a timing light to get it right.Paul.
