Missy,

Be careful with raising dust if you are cleaning up rodent droppings and 
nests.  Out here in the western states hantavirus concerns make it prudent to 
use a decent breathing mask, keep the dust down and clean up well with a 
bleach/water solution.

It may not be as significant an issue on your side of the Mississippi.

Good luck!!
