Subject: Re: Interior panels for '62 23-Window?

If you or anyone else come across decent repros I would like to check into
them myself.
I'll be needing them somewhere towards the spring. My '64 deluxe sunroof has
a 
beutifull color green with a black mesh design. To bad my panels are wheather
damaged.
