&gt;Specifically, a vibration in the steering wheel that comes and goes.  It can
&gt;be gone for a looong time, and return without warning.  It did this morning,
&gt;as I rounded a curve on the hiway east of town.  It only can be noticed at
&gt;55-58+ mph.

Sounds as if your steering damper is getting tired.  You could disconnect one
end of it and work it through its motion.  Look for general weakness and/or
'notchiness' (spots where the action is weaker or stronger than the rest of
the travel).  They used to call it &quot;axle tramp&quot;, that vibration.  It is why
VW put steering dampers in during the late 50s.  You might check front end
alignment, too.  Some times bad alignment agravates the symptoms.  While
you're at it, check the ball joints for wear: they are the parts that _could_
hurt you bad if they quit on you.
