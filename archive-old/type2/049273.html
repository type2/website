Who could I send them to that could repair this tranny?

Dave Crampton is a premier restorer of Kubelwagens (did I spell that
right?), and he lives just a little north of me in Clio, MI.  Nicest guy
you'd ever want to talk VWs with.  If you think he's not too far away, I'll
dig up his number for you and send it (where?).  He might do it.

John Hartranft in Flint, MI
71 Westy
