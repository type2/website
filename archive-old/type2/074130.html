Subject: Re: [T2] Brake lights - help

Have you checked the brake light switch/switches on the master cylinder.
Take the wires off of the cylinder and use a jumper to connect the ends of the wire together, turn the ignition on and brake lights should come on.

If lights come on then switch is duff.

If lights stay off then it could be the combined brake/flasher relay

&gt; To the list,
&gt; 
&gt; My 71 Westy has no brake lights.  Gone through the fuses, bulbs, grounds.
&gt; What I have been told is that it is that the turn signal box.  Dose this 
&gt; sound the next step or should go looking somewhere else?
&gt;

&gt; Thank you for the help.
