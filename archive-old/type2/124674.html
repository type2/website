&gt; So your one of those people that doesn't wave at water cooled huh.  I am
not
&gt; that way.  I am friendly to all VW owners.  I even wave at the New
Beetles.
&gt; They seldom wave back but at least I am being friendly.

Interestingly enough, I seldom get waves back from new Beetle owners.  I was
chalking it up to young yuppie drivers with no idea that the bus is related
to their new ride.  The only wave back that I can remember from new Beetle
owner was from an older couple, maybe in their 50's/60's.
