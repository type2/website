Subject: Re: Bigger bed in 68-73 poptop???

Hi Michael and All,

I had an 'ol 1960 bus that somebody - a carpenter no doubt - had
done a beauty in.  The forward part of the bed became the rear
seat when you slid it into place.  The cupboard (on the right
looking forward) had a slide that held that side of the bed/seat.
All wood. A table would also lift up from the left side with a leg
to hold it.  That and a rear facing seat behind the driver's seat...
Wood partition, too. Well, it was a beauty.

What I'm wondering is...have any of you seen designs like 
that anywhere, and if so, where would one buy the plans, etc. ?
Maybe someone has done that in theirs ?  ('71 to '74 or so)

Any help, etc., etc.  TIA,

- -John Austin

&gt;Re adding better bed to 72 Westy:  Get some 1.5-2&quot; foam at a foam place,
&gt;about a 4x6ft piece.  With a little measuring and ingenuity, you can
&gt;replace the cot with a board (1/2&quot; ply, the good stuff is pretty stiff, and
&gt;you can beef up the edges) that &quot;hinges&quot; in the back and can lift up with
&gt;the top when wanted.  You can make elaborate catches in the front, or be as
&gt;simple as screwing in two eyescrews into the boards that run along the
&gt;sides of poptop and slinging a rope across that catches under board to help
&gt;lift with top. The Euopean version of the 71 I had came with a factory
&gt;Board with foam that had the rear hinges and two rubber grabbers on each
&gt;side in front.  Make a cotton cover for the foam with snaps for washability
&gt;and you will be comfy- and the mat can be used in an outside tent too.
