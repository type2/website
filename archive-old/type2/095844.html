Subject: spring in dizzy hole?

I'm stripping the motor to start from scratch this weekend (old cant get
engine running blues thread), and I noticed a few things.

My 6 year old mechanic assistant/water boy stuck his finger in the hole
where the dizzy goes and said commented on the spring.  Spring?  Sure
enough, there is a spring in there, centered in the hole, about an inch
down..  Is that right?  Dont recall that on any other VW I had, but to tell
the truth I never stuck my finger in there before....
