Subject: Re: [T2] Aux battery size / rating?

The Exide website recommends a group 42 for a '75 Campmobile (their word,
and the last year a camper was listed); 500 CCA, 600 at 32 degrees F, 70 RC
at 25A, dimensions are 9-5/8 x 6-7/8 x 6-7/8. They list a group 41 for a '76
type II. It's 2-1/16&quot; longer, and has 675, 835, and 105 ampre ratings. The
same battery is listed for a '79, which, I presume, is the most demanding of
a battery. Seems awfully small to me. Can't say for sure, but seems like I
got a group 27 into my '72 on the driver's side and a 24 on the other (the
spare tire well interferes, but you could always make a slight
modification). You'll have to fashion some type of restraint for the battery
if you go bigger than stock. PITA to check the water level on.
