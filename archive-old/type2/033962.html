Subject: 71 rear brakes revisited

well... I pulled the drum off of my friend's 71 she just got.  You know,
the bus with super jerky brakes that would pull the brake pedal up and
down? anyways... it was the shoe material.  the lining, whatever its
called came off of the metal shoe in a few pieces.  nasty.  never seen
it happen, or hear of it happening (besides a listee who emailed me
about it)
so we order new brake shoes... friday they'll be in.

so I get to finish the job up friday afternoon/night in 10 degree
weather.... fun!!

at least its in a garage and not windy...
