Hey,
   I've got a '78 westy that's in stellar shape inside and out except
for one problem, sometimes she just doesn't start.  It all started this
summer when I was driving home from Seattle.  I stopped to put in some
gas and when I went to leave she was dead.  It was like a dead battery
except I was getting electricity.  The starter would just click.  I took
it to the only shop in town and after 7 hours they finally got her
started.  Half way home it happened again. I was towed to the nearest VW
dealer where Lucille (my bus) was kept for a few days.  They said she
was fixed then not 30 miles down the road while getting gas it happened
again.  I went to another VW dealer, they said she was fixed. 500 miles
down the rod guess what?  I was so fed up I climbed underneath and
clubbed the starter with a hammer and there she went.  I drove the next
2000 miles with a hammer to start.  Since then the starter, solenoid and
battery have all been replaced but she's still not fixed.  Does anyone
have any ideas, thanks.
