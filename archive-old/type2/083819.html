Subject: Re: [T2] new AFM &amp; temp sensor

I found the temp sensor locally &amp; installed it in the parking lot. I
can now attest that in addition to crappy idle, jumping, lurching, &amp;
general crappy performance you can see a power loss from a flakey temp
sensor #2.

&gt; picking up a new one this evening, but was wondering if anyone has
&gt; seen this as well.
