Subject: Re: [T2] new cip1 1600 longblock

Single relief engines run 15-20F hotter oil temperatures then dual relief
due to the nature of their design (this is why VW went to dual relief to
keep the smog engines cooler in the first place). This is why we do not sell
Single Relief engines or blocks here at our store. But they are $200 less in
cost and end price, which is all some stores (and some customers) care
about, lower price. Some are up front about this, others &quot;hide&quot; it among a
bunch of misleading text (&quot;German Quality&quot; (one would assume it's german, it
is not), &quot;OEM&quot;, etc etc.

I get a lot of flak for suggesting that when you see a lower price, there's
usually a very good reason why. The problem is figuring the reason why.
Sometimes it's because of an incredible deal (like some of Bus Depot's
connections and big buys), but sometimes it's just a head-fake to sucker
customers.
