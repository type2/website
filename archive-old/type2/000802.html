Greetings...

I realize that this has been covered, although not too recently..

What's the word on engine flushes on ACVW engines?  I have a 1600 dp that
may or may not have some blocked oil passages...  I haven't done this before
and was curious if the engine flush was especially detrimental to this
engine?

Thanks,

Tom
