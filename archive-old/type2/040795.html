Subject: Re:  Jack for bus- the low bread approach

Howard,
You got a 70 bus and little bread?  Been there.   All you need is 2
scissor jacks and another one or a cable to hold the trans, a board
about 2x2ft, 2-3 broomsticks about 2 ft long, and a good short handled
sledge hammer-back in college I musta pulled my 71 engine in 5 minutes
in parking lots trying to find a _at_^#%$ oil leak that turned out to be a
crack behind the flywheel.  I put the board on the rollers on the
parking lot, then positioned the scissor jacks on either side of the
sump plate, toed in slightly at the front.  Bus needs to be lifted only
about 3&quot;- I drove it  up onto pieces of 2x6 nailed together to offer 3&quot;
of lift.  Jack up the engine to pull the hangers (believe it or not, I
operated both scissor jacks at once, a handle in each hand- the
advantage is that those handles have a long reach and they don't need up
and down pumping!  Let the engine down with the trans so you can reach
the upper mount nuts behind the engine, then leave it level to the
ground so the trans-shaft comes out horizontal to the ground when you
pull or reassemble. After letting it down, I just rolled it out while
holding the manifold bends.  The broomsticks let you roll it in there
alone, using the sledge to nudge the board into the right position while
you lie under there watching that trans-shaft.  If you worked on the
engine, you can get it on the board, then tip one side to get a jack
under; then use a long 2x4 under the heater box and a 4x4 fulcrum piece
to lift the other box and slip the jack under.  I was a slight 130 lbs
then and managed.
     For on the road repairs, I have a bottle jack, which lets you
unscrew the top to reach even to the center of the front axle beam.
These are very efficient; you can lift a bus just pumping with a
screwdriver!
With the heavy 78, I use the Sears (3 ton?) medium size hydraulic
rolling jack, useing a shim made from a 6x6 with a cutout for straddling
the front steering arm bushing housing and a centering cutout for the
jack top.  With this I can get under the shock mount un the rear to
quickly lift the rear wheel, or use a 4x4 shim under the axle tube.
Trick is to use jack stands and keep things centered!
