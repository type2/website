Subject: Re: [T2] '79 Bus won't stay running all the sudden

Depending on how full your gas tank was when you parked it, it could easily 
be a fuel gumming problem. I'd get some GUMOUT or equivalent fuel injector 
cleaner. That stuff works really well when the problem is actual dirt in 
the injectors, definitely not a miracle fix all. You might also try 
changing the fuel filter, though I don't think it usually gets clogged by 
gummy gas. If your tank was only a third full or so, you should probably 
pour in the gum out and fill up the tank and drive until it gets better, 
i.e. when gumout has had a chance to work it's way through your fuel 
system. I think this hypothesis could explain the symptoms of driving well 
for awhile before the requisite amount of fuel gunk got stuck on the 
injectors... but I could be wrong, maybe someone wiser than I will chime in.

If you parked the bus with a full tank, this may still be the problem, but 
from what I've read, it's more likely to happen when there are fumes rather 
than liquid in the tank.
