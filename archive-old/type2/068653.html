&gt;I just returned from the garage and hada look at the head in question. The
&gt;intake vlave seat on number was not dropped or dislodged by pushed

Is that not &quot;by&quot; and instead &quot;but&quot;?

&gt;in a fraction. There was exhaust etc from where the head was not meeting
&gt;the cylinder. Any one familiar with this one?

 &quot;where the head was not meeting the cylinder&quot;  Do you mean that the head
was not sealing the against the cylinder?

Hmmm, your above paragraph needs to be proof read.  Maybe your head nuts
needed to be retorqued.  That would certainly lower your compression test
numbers (and would make the engine quite loud). This is also a fairly
common problem and one a careless engine builder might overlook.

If there is a problem with the sealing surface of the head,  then I would
have a discussion with GEX.  It is possible they put a messed up head into
the engine which is a definate no-no.  Did they claim to give you new or
rebuilt heads?  Either way, if they put a bad head in I would give them
hell if I were you.
