I believe David's point here is not so much the CR, but the volumetric
balance, which is more important to get right than matching CR.  Anyway,
if you are paying over the odds for the MSHP heads and you've spent $$
balancing your rods to 1g or whatever, you should expect to get matching
combustion chambers.  If you want a longer lasting, more reliable engine
that gives you more power AND better fuel consumption, I say go for it,
it's worth the extra effort.  As with most things in life these days
though, if you want a job done properly, you have to do it yourself...

&gt; Regarding the size of the combustion chambers.
&gt; Presuming you have a 2.0L engine.  If the size of the
&gt; chamber changes by 1cc the difference in the compression
&gt; ratio will change by less than .1.
&gt; Probably not enough to worry about.
