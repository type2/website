Subject: 80 vanagon

I'll try to post this without getting in trouble, but I figure there's
enough of you out there looking for aircooled vanagons. If you take a look
at a notorious auction site and look for vanagons in the parts car section,
you'll stubble across an 80 westy poptop vanagon thats a goer at $500. I've
got nothing to do with it, just passin this along.
