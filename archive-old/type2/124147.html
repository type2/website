Subject: [T2] Check Air/Fuel Mixture Using Oxygen Sensor?


&gt; I need to check my air fuel mixture ratio.  I have a '79 bus with
&gt; California emissions, so it has an installed oxygen sensor.  Has anyone
&gt; successfully used the output ffrom  the oxygen sensor to check air/fuel
&gt; mixture ratio?  If so, can you share your method?

Yes, and I believe it works fairly well.

Have the engine *completely* warmed up.

(The assumption is that everything else on the engine is in spec.)

With the engine *not* running, disconnect the O2 sensor from FI wiring
harness.

Attach your voltmeter to the O2 sensor and to ground.

(If necessary, set voltmeter to a range the includes 0 to 1.5 volts.)

Start up engine and watch voltage output.  If voltage output is fairly
steady over .5 volts engine is too rich.  If voltage output is fairly steady
under .5 volts engine is too lean.  If voltage fluctuates rapidly right
around .5 volts then air/fuel mixture is within the ballpark.  (The voltage
output of the O2 sensor related to air/fuel mixture is a roughly &quot;S&quot; shaped
curve with the &quot;vertical&quot; part of the curve being *very* steep.)

Normally, adjustment of the air/fuel mixture takes place at the AFM using
the basic mixture screw and you should see changes is voltage output as you
adjust the screw.

If adjusting the internal spring of the AFM be aware that having the plastic
cover removed can introduce an air leak into the engine so final monitoring
of the O2 sensor voltage should be done with the cover in place and sealed.
