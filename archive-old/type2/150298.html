I don't know. That's what I'm trying to determine. I think it might  
be bent there but I'm still not sure. I'd like a 2nd or 3rd opinion.

Cable #1 broke in 1989 when the clutch glued itself to the flywheel  
and the cable rusted out.

Cable #2 broke in 2002 while driving. It broke at the lever arm for  
the throwout fork where the cable is pinched by the threaded end.  
Corrosion helped it break.

Cable #3 broke in 2005 inside the original bowden tube because I  
didn't lubricate it enough and the inner plastic sleeve was worn.

Cable #4 is making noises. Not the creaky cable breaking sounds but  
sometimes the pedal is smooth and sometimes it grinds...
