Al,

A grey market car? I looked at a'72 panel van the other day. Are you saying
it would have been kinda smuggled into the states ?

Comercial vehicles were not imported into the US after 1971 (as a result
of the &quot;chicken war- tarrif wars&quot;) and that included single cabs (261),
double cabs (265), panels (211) or ambulances (274). Any such vehicles
in the US later than 71's were probably grey-market cars.
I'm guessing you're in the US, but I may be wrong! Such a vehicle would
not be all that uncommon in the UK or European continent.

69 double cab
