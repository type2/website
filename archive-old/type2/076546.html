Subject: horsepower question - follow up


Audacious peers,
I wanted to let folks know the outcome of the underpowered 1973 day camper 
saga. I systematically went through every suggestion posted to me last 
weekend, and then did a minor carb adjustment. well, in cleaning the fuel 
tank, adding a pressure regulator, examining the coil, double checking 
vacuum system, and just giving everything a once over, i discovered that my 
carb linkage (dual 34s) throttle cable bracket was pulling out a plug wire 
while driving, just by catching the top of the dist plug, and so effectively 
i was only running on 3 cyl on the road, but 4 in the driveway! totally a 
stupid problem, but one that frustrated me for a long time. so thanks to the 
suggestions it runs 100% better and actually goes uphill now!
three cheers for the list!
-jeremy
