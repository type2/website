Subject: Re: [T2] Do you have bright headlights?


Has anyone had any problems with these lights switching direction?  It only
assembles one way.  But When I hit hi beams on one side it actually shoots
straight down.  My fix turn the headlight upside down.  I have one like that
and the other right side up.  Just wondering if anyone found a better fix
for this?  Or if I am the only one that this happened to.

FWIW  It used to work correctly then I was involved in 2 accidents 3 weeks
apart and it sat at the garage for 6 months before I got her back and it has
been that way ever since.  This is on a 73 Bus.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
