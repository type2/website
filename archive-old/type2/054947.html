Subject: Whats my problem?

I just bought a &quot;new&quot; bus a few weeks ago.  I drove it all the way home from 
Baltimore, MD to Bloomington, IL.  I don't know much about fixing buses, this 
is my second one.  Anyways, it seemed to do great all the way home from 
Baltimore.  Got good gas mileage and I was able to actually pass people!  BUT 
of course it decided that it had to have some problems now.  When I drive it 
in town it can't seem to keep itself alive, its constantly threatening to die 
on me.  The more I drive it the worse it gets.  When I stop at stop signs, or 
lights the oil light will start to flicker and then it just dies.  I've 
checked my oil several times, seems to be fine.  Could it be as simple as its 
idling too low?  The engine seems to get really hot as I've noticed as well, 
is it overheating part of my problem?   I thought it could possibly be that 
instead of my heat coming out in the bus that maybe its just blowing back 
into the engine, I really don't know...any help is appreciated, thanks.
