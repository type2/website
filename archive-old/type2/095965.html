Subject: the wiper switch and the bad idea

------=_NextPart_001_0002_01C25FD5.0F9F3500

has any one ever taken apart their late model wiper switch before? I just=
 did. Could any one tell me how many of the little springs there should b=
e and where they might go? I think I figured it out, but I can't find one=
 of the little springs. I found one in my hair. Here's hoping.
Thakns,
Kyle
