Subject: swivel foot adjusters?


hello all. does anyone out there know where I might get my greasy little 
mitts on a set of swivel foot, or is it feet or perhaps footi ;) adjusters 
for a '78 2L FI engine with hydro lifters? Anybody see a reason why I 
shouldn't use them if they are available? Guess I'll also need to know where 
to get the shims/spacers/etc..to keep the VT geometry correct, right?
Thanks,
