Subject: Angels Camp Show

Heya, if any out-of-towners are coming to the show, I live within
stumbling distance.  I'll be there in my Mexico Beige '79 Westy.  If
anyone's interested, we can grab up something to grill and some
beverages and have a some post-show revelry at my place on Angels
Creek.  Dipping optional.

I've got a single spot here if someone would like to camp for the eve. 
There's a gazebo with a hammock in the back.

Show info:

Including lodging and camping options.

Teri
