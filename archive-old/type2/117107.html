Subject: busses/trucks for sale

these are not my busses and i know nothing about them but sice most of you
probably don't subscribe to &quot;old cars weekly&quot; i thought i'd pass this on.

63 DC no engine, title or bumpers says surface rust only otherwise solid
1800$ 724-941-7143 in PA

65 SC 44k original miles 1600 dp 12 volts converion restored by dealership
like new 4800$ 724-941-7143 in PA

69 westy camper everything including icebox 2500$ 956-648-8138 in Mission,
TX

that SC sounds like a pretty sweet deal if it is as described
