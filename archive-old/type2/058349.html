Hey list,
	I'm almost ready to chuck the real world and live out of my bus. Is there any
one in the continental USA who would be interested in taking on a bus mechanic
apprentice? I have mechanical experience, just not VW. I could live in my
camper, but I would need some monetary remuneration, I still gotta eat! I
think I'm serious about this, any takers?
