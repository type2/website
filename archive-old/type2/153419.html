Subject: RE: [T2] Running rich when warm issue is back (On my knees  
  begging for help)

Sorry, I was a little incoherent when I wrote that last email. Honestly, I
wasn't drinking the Cuervo either. 

I meant to ask about a manifold atmospheric pressure sensor. It senses the
total negative pressure in the intake manifold and adjusts the mixture
accordingly. I know that's what the AFM does but only differently. The AFM
measures the volume on air flowing past the vane using velocity. Depending
on the year of the cars (I know on Japanese or USA autos) their going to
have one, the other, or both with newer autos replacing the AFM with a mass
airflow sensor that uses a heated filament and a thermistor. These German
autos are alien to me so I don't know how much fine tuning of the mixture
the EFI system does.
