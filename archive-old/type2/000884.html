Happy weekend to all!   I’ve got a 1970 that was a bit abused when I got
her but is now doing much better, though I still have a couple of
problems to solve.  I’m getting ready to replace my ball joints and do
some other front end work, and as I was going through my Bentley I read
a short section on adjusting the turning radius stops (can’t remember if
that’s the exact terminology as my manual isn’t right here…).  Anyways,
the stops are actually two little bolts sitting midway on top of the
torsion bar that prevent the wheels from turning too far.  I remember
that my bus had a little too much radius and the left tire would
actually contact some metal.  So I look at the stops and sure enough one
is bent and ill-looking.  And then I remember a line in the Bentley as
to when the stops were put in busses – from 211… on.  And I’ve got a
220…  So what gives – a whole new torsion bar?  Someone added these?
Does anyone else have these on an earlier bus or do I have some oddity?
And – the real question here – if the stop wasn’t adjusted right and
this bus has been driven a considerable amount, could there be any
damage to my front end, other than bad tire wear etc.?


Thanks all-


Robert
