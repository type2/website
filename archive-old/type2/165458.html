&gt; Watched the Mythbusters show related to &quot;should tailgate of a pickup be

&gt;   They busted that one (opposite is true) by showing how a &quot;bubble&quot; of
&gt; air rolling between the cab and tailgate keeps the majority of airflow
&gt; going over the plane of the whole truck and down to the ground beyond
&gt; the truck.  The flow of that air starts behind the sharp vertical edge
&gt; of the cab and is like our busses in the back- the air drops quickly and
&gt; rolls from ground in towards the engine lid- so if it is open, the warm
&gt; air back there from engine/exhaust will indeed be rolled right into the
&gt; engine compartment and rerun by the fan!

Mythbusters is a fun show, but beware of drawing any parallel conclusions
from their data.  Their purpose is to entertain.

A bus will carry a &quot;bubble&quot; of turbulant air along behind it.  Since the
air exhausted by the cooling system goes right into this bubble it is
logical to figure that some of it will reciruclate through the engine lid
door.

Another way of thinking about it:  There was a good reason that VW put the
air inlets way up there and went to such pains to seal the engine and door
to the body!  :)
