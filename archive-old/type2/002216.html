make sure to report when this one gets solved- a lot of people are
going to be interested. my personal opinion is to start with the
basics to get the engine running. drain the oil, pan for glitter ( bearings),
then start with basic engine parameters- pull the valve covers to see if
everything is intact ( there was no noise , it didn't overheat, etc. )
i suppose a spun bearing could provide blockage to the oil circuit,
but there would be noise or the deafening silence of a seized engine...
assuming the engine has basic mechanical parameters, i would
examine the ignition and attempt to start, or use starting fluid to
bypass a carb malfunction at least enough to see if it will fire.
possibly a dead cold compression test would reveal a few clues...
&quot;backfires through the carb&quot; could be valves, ignition, or carburetion....
