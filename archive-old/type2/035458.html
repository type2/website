Subject: Re: '70 Vs '77 Drivability impressions

Hi John---
    Our situations are almost identical---I drove a '71 every day for 20 
years, and now drive a '77 Westfalia.  It took some tweaking to get there, 
but I consider my '77 to be superior in just about every respect (bumpers and 
aluminum trim notwithstanding).  I dearly loved my '71, but the '77 is 
quieter, more comfortable, slightly faster, and on it's worst day runs better 
than the '71 ever did (and it was sweet).  They both roll about the same, but 
I think that the '77 has an improved steering box---the '71 had more play and 
was kind of clanky.  My '77 didn't shift well either when I bought it, but 
with new bushings and some Redline MT-90 it's as slick as snot.  BOTH my 
buses' clutches chatter---I just think it's my lot in life to always drive a 
bus with a shuddering clutch.  Nothing that I've tried has fixed it.  
    If you've got good compression, don't get discouraged.  I was very leery 
of abandoning the upright for the 2.0 litre, but I now love this motor, even 
though I still don't know where everything is.

Good luck, Matt Q.  Laguna Beach, CA
