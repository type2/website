I think that's a great idea, but since I have mounted the oil filter
holder already, I'll have to pass.  I ordered a VDO sender that goes in
the sump plate.  Tried to get it from my local NAPA, but they only carry
the more popular VDO stuff, so I mail ordered it.

&gt;Dear John,
&gt;
&gt;I think that you won't be able to meassure the right temperature this 
&gt;way, &gt;but what do you think about drilling a hole into the top of the 
&gt;oilfilter &gt;holder. This will give the exact oil temp and there's plenty
of space 
&gt;for &gt;the sender. The oilfilter holder top is about 4 mm thick so the
sender 
&gt;will &gt;fit in there and won't even touch the oilfilter when its mounted.
&gt;
&gt;Try this out...
