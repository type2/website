I was using another brand of rust stuff, and whenever I applied *too* 
much of it the paint in that area would peel up.  Anyplace where I 
already had paint and spilled some on it would peel the newly added 
paint.  FWIW this might apply to the POR-20 stuff too.

I would rather you vote against me than not vote at all.
Get out and VOTE on November 5th (USA folks that is !)

&gt; &gt; days, then installed. Didn't take long for the paint to bubble up and come
&gt; &gt; off in flakes. Btw, unlike the name would suggest, POR-20 should *not* be
&gt; &gt; painted over rust.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Maybe I did something wrong in the prep work and it's my fault, but I
&gt; &gt; don't know what.

&gt; Sami - 
&gt; 
&gt; Dank. Bummer. I've had pretty good luck with POR-15, and was hoping the
&gt; POR-20 stuff was as good... I guess the question goes back out then - is
&gt; there a good exhaust/manifold paint?
