I had something similar happen with my 1970 Kombi 2 years ago, I was
fiddling
with the head lamp switch and the spring reostat (spelling?) decided to
break--
made a plume of smoke, some sparks and scared me....good thing I was at a
show at the time...

Subject: smoking light switch


&gt;Hey gang,
&gt;
&gt;On my way home today I hit a tunnel and turned on my lights, a coupple min.
&gt;later I smelled and then saw some smoke comming out of the area surrounding
&gt;the light switch.  Being daylight i just turned the lights of.  When home I
&gt;took of the cover for the instrument pannel but couldn't see anything
wrong.
&gt;  Even tried leaving the lights on for a while and watching to try and find
&gt;the smoke source, but it didn't rear it's ugly head.
&gt;Has anybody had this happen before, or know what it might be?
&gt;
&gt;Any help would be great.  I was planning to head out and about this evening
&gt;and lights would be nice.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;
