G'day Airheads :)

You may remember I replaced my clutch cable a couple of weeks
ago. Since then, I've had to tighten it 3 times to take out
the &quot;stretch&quot;. Now I'm in the position that if I tighten up the
cable enough to avoid clashing gears while shifting, I get 
clutch slippage in 4th going uphill under a load.

I'm thinking I have a soft pressure plate -- especially since I
saw some damage to some of the fingers when last I had the engine
out about a year ago.

Does this seem plausible, or should I back the cable off a half-dozen
clicks and play with the linkages some more?

Thanks for the collective karma.
