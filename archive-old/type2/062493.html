&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;'Lo all:
&gt; &gt;I'm in a quandry about rebuilding my carb. It's not the building that 
&gt; &gt;troubles me, it's he cleaning. After you soak the carb, you're supposed to 
&gt; &gt;blow out all the passages with compressed air. Problem is, you guessed it, I 
&gt; &gt;have no air compressor. And I don't think it would be fiscally advisable to 
&gt; &gt;buy one to rebuild my carb. Any thoughts? Does anyone sell cans of 
&gt; &gt;compressed air?

I just used canned air from Wal-Mart, worked just fine...
