Tom:
I guess my point is that if you needed 100 of these ferrules , then $4
each is a lot, I'll bet I could make 10,000 of them for less than $.40
each, but for small pieces, getting stuff from a VW dealer with a GOOD
parts person is pretty darn handy. I'm sure my local guy would mail
parts, but you can probably find someone in your own state or closer.
I'd ask the list for the name of a dealer with a good, helpful parts
person. I've looked at lots of parts books, was in the parts business
for 4 years, and I can tell you, the VW books are not the best. Not the
worst either, but that's where an experienced person can save you lots
of greif. I have to get all my Porsche parts by mail order, and finding
the right person/ personality is really helpful. I have a lot of respect
for these guys- I've been there, done that!
