&gt; Thanks for everybody's help on the wobbly speedo.  Now, driving my '71 today, my Oil warning light came on only at idle after about 3 miles.  Every time I came to a complete stop it would come on but even the slightest touch of the accelerator and it would go off.  Is this just a low oil problem or something more serious? Please help!
&gt; Thanks,

I think you need to change to thicker oil. Try 20w-50 or maybe straight
40 weight. In your climate, I'd recommend 40 in the summer and 20-50 in
the winter.
