&gt;Barring unforeseen
&gt; circumstances, red tape, mountain traffic jams and that sort of thing, I
&gt; would give yourself at least a full 2 days for the drive (including time to
&gt; enjoy the beauty of the land

Amen. 

But maybe more. It takes 1 full day from San Antonio to Saltillo. (Border 
hassles!! You must leave a record and deposit for the automobile you are 
&quot;importing&quot;.) 

One day from Saltillo to Mexico City. One day from Mexico to Guadalara,
and that is on the best highways available. 

The traffic is maddening sometimes. But, the roads are generally good. 

Don't drive at night. Road hazards abound, like cows etc, but &quot;banderos&quot;
still exist in the out of the way spots, too. e where you are going to be by 
nightfall. 

I have never (I repeat NEVER) camped out in Mexico. Unless you can find a 
protected camping spot that advertises their security, I would advise not 
camping anywhere, especially in the &quot;out of the way&quot; places that campers love 
the most. Is it dangerous? Probably not, but bad things more frequently 
happen there that seldom happen here.  

I speak Spanish fluently, and I would still not do it. Little hotels are very 
cheap and much, much safer. I recall not five years ago, when the Ambassador 
to Mexico from Germany, who was a camping fanatic, was killed by a group of 
bandits over pocket change.... While camping.... 

Not to frighten you away, but be where you want to be by dark. 

On the other hand, I have never seen a more beautiful country, and once you 
get into the mountains, the vistas and weather are to die for. A little rainy 
in the summer, but cool and sunny usually. 

And I still choose to drive through Mexico whenever I can. My next trip will 
be from Dallas to Chetumal, at the base of the Yucatan Peninsula.
