&gt; What was the brand of coil used originally on VW? My '73 
&gt; Beetle was bought from the original owner and it had a 
&gt; Lucas coil.  PO said he thought it was the original, but 
&gt; with 20 years and 475,000 miles it coulda slipped his mind.
&gt; I kept that coil when I sold the car, replaced by blue coil.
&gt; I never noticed any performance change with vacuum advance,
&gt; 34PICT, and points.  Just fell for the blue coil hype.  Next
&gt; time, I'll get the Electronic ignition and Jacobs coil system.
&gt; I've seen this setup work on 240Zs very well, prob. will work
&gt; well on my bus, too.

I can vouch for that! I have a 1971 240Z with a Jacobs Omnicoil and 
wires. It works awesome. Iam going to put the same on my 69 bus. It turns 
the points into just switchers so the points literally never wear out. 
What is really incredible is starting the car after it has sat for two 
months; It starts on the first try. Also, early morning cold starts work 
bitchin' - starts just as easy. I think where the system really shines is 
on tired engines with lots of miles. Saw a Z once with 300,000+ miles on 
the original 2.4litre engine. There was a  noticeable difference between 
the Jacobs coil and wires and the Allison high voltage coil and wires, that 
being the only change at all. (Allison was brand new, the JAcobs had 30,000
miles on topof it!) The JAcobs would start the 240Z right up while the Allison 
would just barely keep it running.

Also, I would stay away from that LUCAS coil. You are likely to pick up an 
electric or fuel infection from some British car and spread it to your 69 
Bus. Friends dont let friends use Lucas parts on their cars. just my 
2cents &lt;G&gt;
