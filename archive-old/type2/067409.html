Some ideas/tips -
&gt; glue on using....what?  I guess some sort of carpet glue, if such a
Don't glue, just place  them in place, dirt goes through carpet, you 
want to be able to get them out to clean.  Rubber on rubber shouldn't 
move much.

&gt; How easy were they to cut out...any tips for doing so?
Wear leather gloves and use a linoleum knife.  One of those curved 
blade knives with the cutting edge on the inside curved edge.  Place 
the carpet on the lawn.  The Lawn? you say, yes you can cut down into 
the grass without damaging the floor of your house.  Lay the carpet 
with the backing UP, to be able to mark it and not loose track of 
cut.  Wear gloves as the backing is VERY abrasive.  BTDT = ouch.
Another tool that works well is a sharp replaceable blade knife.  The 
kind that has an about 1.5 inch long blade sticking out.
If lawn isn't available, do it on the carpet (the knap from the 
carpets being face to face provides space for the knife blade)
