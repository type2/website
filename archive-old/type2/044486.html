Subject: [T2] Accelerator cable

Hello all.. Does anyone have experience replacing an accelerator cable
on a 1970 Westy?  I ordered the new cable and it differs from the
original.  The end which attaches to the pedal assembly is an &quot;s&quot; shape
on the new one, and a &quot;donut&quot; shape on the original.  I thought i had
ordered the wrong cable but the vendor insists its the correct one.  Any
help or diagrams, etc. would be very appreciated.
