Subject: darned po's

well its actually been a week where something got done around here. Made my
run stand outa my generic V8 stand and boy does it hook up sweet, nice to
have a few stands around. Pulled the engine outa my recently acquired 68 or
69 and found the usuall po stuff, 3 studs not 4,rats nest de wireing, bug
adaptor on the moustach bar and of course bug heater boxes not hooked up.
But wait, whats this, a complete thermostat hookup, never in all my years!
Might have something to do with it being the great white north&lt;grin&gt;
