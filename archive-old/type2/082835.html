&gt; &gt; These days, most fans use brushless motors, but it is not 100% and there
&gt; &gt; are no latex car paints, AFAIK.
&gt;
&gt; Terry, you're gonna trip:
&gt;
&gt; Sikkens Autowave Filler 790 is a waterborne primer. In the Technical Data
&gt; Sheet: &quot;contains acrylic latex resins and butoxyethanol.&quot;

This is a primer/filler, not a paint.

&gt; Glasurit also makes a waterborne line. It's probably latex based too.

I looked thru the Material Safety Data Sheets for Glasurit products posted
at: http://www.health.adelaide_dot_edu.au/ComMed/consulting/eap/eap.htm and
the only thing I see with either &quot;water&quot; or &quot;latex&quot; is a rubbing compound.
I tried the Glasurit site, but ran out of patience before I found anything
(I have a 5 minute limit on waiting for &quot;dancing baloney&quot; javascripts to
download :-)

Automotive paint is a big universe and while I would be surprised if it
were possible to make an automotive-grade paint in a latex base, I would
not be shocked.  I think of latex as a very &quot;soft&quot; base for paint, but in
the olden days, flats were latex and gloss was enamel.  Today, latex
enamels are all over the place in house paint.  Chemists have done amazing
things before, and may yet make an acceptable latex-based paint that is
hard and glossy enough for automotive use.
