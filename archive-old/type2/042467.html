Subject:  re:the factory jack? or am I missing something

The &quot;thingie&quot; that flops down goes into one of the
jack receptacles, and doesn't need any kind of spring
to keep it up, as it will fit snugly into the jack
socket.  Slide it into the socket, strighten up the
jack so the bottom rests on the ground, and crank away
to raise up the bus.
Hope this helps.

Jim
