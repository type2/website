&lt;&lt; Mike,

I rebuilt my type IV and powdercoated the tin and extras. I left the case

alone but you could easily paint this with myriad colors available for

engines. Works and looks great .

Dave &gt;&gt;

Hopefully, in a dark (black), color to facilitate heat transfer. Those
trailer queen VW's with chrome everything in the engine compartment
are counterproductive to performance (including that &quot;clean&quot; looking
009...).
