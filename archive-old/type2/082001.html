Subject: More Corvair Bus Troubles W.V. (Transmission)

I am having a time of it with my Corvair VW bus I just bought.  We got the
engine going again.  I had thought it siezed but it did not - the battery
just went dead.  Good thing it was night and I had the headlights on or it
would have toasted it before the battery died.  Smokes a little.  Now I have
driven it 30 miles and the transmission has acted up.  It is stuck in 1st
and the shifter moves into 1, 3, and neutral but it stays in first no matter
what, unless I push the clutch in.  It even stays in first when in neutral,
though if I go for third it makes some scraping noises.  If anybody is
familiar with the Tranvair kit and you think this could be the shifter
please let me have your thoughts as they'd be most appreciated!  I am hoping
it's the shifter or linkage, not the transmission!  I checked the crude
linkage and it looked okay, at least it's hooked up.  It's a Corvair
transmission too.  Also I would not mind hearing from any local bus people
here in West Virginia just for the heck of it.  Glen Ward
