I suppose you could, but then you want to worry about bottoming out.  If you
read what it says on the pages I listed, it says that changing the ride height
too far from stock can cause extra wear on cv joints.  If your bus is already
sitting too high, lowering to stock might be ok.  But if you're looking to make
it a lowrider, go with the aftermarket kits, and do more research.

&gt; What you have to do is pull the plates off the torsion arms and pull
&gt; &gt; them out to release the pressure, turn them up a notch (each notch is said
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; give about three inches lift on good torsion bars that don't sag) and
&gt; shove them
&gt; &gt; back in.  It's not as painful as it sounds.
