Subject: taking the bus

&gt; And I have a bus question... I have been planning on buying a bus for a

&gt; commute (25 miles each way).  Is it obnoxiously stupid for me to consider
&gt; using a bus in this way?  Does anyone do this?  Is there any special
&gt; maintenance considerations?


Stupid? no way.  Do we do it? Every day. (ok, I admit...I've been hitching
lately in the gf's NB..hard to beat a diesel.)

If you dont mine the lack of AC, and you keep up with your maintenance as
scheduled and needed...you shouldnt have any problems beyond those
problems you'd have normally.

A plus of using it daily is that you're more likely to trust the bus when
you take a longer trip.  When I daily drove mine I never hestitated to hop
in and go....anywhere.  These days, with the bus seeing less miles per
day, I always have to think before I drive...be sure I'm up to date on oil
changes, valve adjustments, odd rattles, strange grinds.

It IS good to have a backup plan for getting to work, though....A bus can
be a tempermental beast.  Not to mention that it sucks to have to rush a
weekend repair job because the bus has to be running for the trip to work
on Monday.

anywho. Find it, fix it, drive it daily. Welcome to the Aircooled Search
and Rescue team.
