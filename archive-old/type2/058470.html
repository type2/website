Subject: Free Parts

Ok, listee's I am down to the last of the free parts.  What
I have left is a working Auotmatic tranny from a '73 (fits
73, 74, and 75 I think), steering column with ignition
switch &amp; key, and a Haynes Manual for '72 thru '79
transporter, which I would like to trade for the Haynes
Manual for a 'XX to '71 transporter.  Isn't there someone
out there who has traded up from their type 1 engine, to a
type 4 and needs the manual that covers the type 4??  If I
cannot give away the auto tranny perhaps one of the rebuild
shops will give me credit for it on a rebuilt tranny for my
'71????   BTW, when I offered the free parts I sent them to
the first requestor, so if you e-mailed me for a part and I
did not respond/send it, it is because it was already spoken
for.
