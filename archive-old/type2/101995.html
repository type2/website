&gt;Does anyone have a source for German Bosch 10110 ignition points??
&gt;
&gt;How about German Bosch W8cc spark plugs??

You can order them online from Bus Depot and the other online places, but I'd be very surprised if you aren't able to find them in town at a vwflaps and even at other parts stores that advertize Bosch parts.

I just found a place nearby that sells that stuff along with Mahle air and oil filters so I'm in heaven. Online will always be cheaper and sometimes quite a bit, but you have to consider the shipping costs if you aren't adding to a larger order.
