Subject: Re: [T2] 7 degrees



&gt; Measure diameter of the pulley x 3.14159 / 360 x 7. If you use millimeters
&gt; you won't have to convert fractions in inches. I don't wish to belittle
&gt; anyone, but it scares the hell out of me that anyone who doesn't know this
&gt; basic math could possibly have a HS diploma. This is 7th grade stuff.
&gt;

Public Education? lol Seriously though, mathematics while being easy may be
more difficult to apply to situations like this where an engine seems to run
like &quot;magic&quot;.

Just remember everyone, when working on your bus stuff its all mathematical.
