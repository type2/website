Hello All  Looks like I made a smart move saving all the gas tanks from the 
vehicles I scrapped over the years I have all kinds of these from late 50's 
to 90's. You guys need any let me know and maybe I could bring to a show near 
you.For that matter help me out here. I go to a lot of swaps and always have 
to guess what the hell everybody wants. So of course I have been packing a 
little of everything.It seems to me that we could help each other out.I have 
over 30 years of parts that I would like to see in hands that need them.  Let 
Me know what you need. Later Mark Dearing Salem Import Service Salem Va  540
