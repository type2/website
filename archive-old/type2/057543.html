Subject: ECU and Y2K a ?

Hey all,
Just a question regarding the ECU, I am guessing that the ECU has no
computer memory or chip components and is a simple system of on/off
switches based on receiving electrical current or not. If that is the
case then Y2K is not an issue. So I am not concerned about it. Can
someone verify this, or alert us to possible Y2K problems. Not that it
will really matter much when the power grid fails, but in case the grid
doesn't fail and such would like to be prepared when I return to the US.
BTW if you are at all interested in Y2K or you have not given it much
thought get the August issue of Wired mag. It is an eye opener to be
sure. Thanks,
Scoob
