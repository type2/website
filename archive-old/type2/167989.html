Subject: Re: [T2] emissions retrofit...

You've been lucky so far.....

This would open such a large can o' worms I could go fishing for the next
decade.

Keep in mind that many of the Eastern States are seriously considering
emulating 100 percent the California emission testing standards in the next
few years, so I wouldn't even think of doing this.  Some states back there
have &quot;cherry picked&quot; some Calif standards already and it's only gonna get
stiffer.  California requires 76-later to be tested (for now).

The main rule here in California is that the engine transplant must be the
same year or newer.  Older year engines are strictly a no-no in Calif.

Swapping Vin plates (if caught) can just get you in a ton o' trouble at the
federal level, much less the state gendarmes.  Out here in California, you
stand to permanently lose the vehicle if caught.

And considering the weight of a Vanagon, the 1800 aircooled is just too
underpowered to effectively move it down the road.  That's one of the
reasons why VW gave up on the 2.0 aircooled in the middle 1983 to go
watercooled.  Better power, better emission controls, although VW should
have used the inline golf/rabbit gas engine rather than the wasserboxer.

For all of the potential trouble, I'd get Boston Bob to rebuild the
Vanagon's wasserboxer so it's done right.

&gt; Hello List,
&gt;
&gt; let me know if this is possible.
&gt;
&gt; I am looking into getting a '86 vanagon syncro that has a bad
&gt; (water-cooled) motor.
&gt; I have a good running 1800cc at home (the backup for my '74, which has
&gt; a very solid 2000cc).
&gt; The 1800cc from a '75 bus, fuel injected, very complete including the
&gt; EGR system.
&gt;
&gt; I was thinking, I'll just throw the 1800cc in the vanagon. As this has
&gt; always been my VW approach... but then my father pointed out that the
&gt; vanagon would need to pass Massachusetts emissions... something I've
&gt; never had to worry about. Mass. requires all '84  and newer vehicles
&gt; to pass emissions....
&gt;
&gt;                  Hydrocarbons Carbon Monoxide Oxides of Nitrogen
&gt; 1984   1990    2.0               30.0                 3.0
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; What would I have to do to get that motor to pass this emissions
&gt; check? Could I simply add a catalytic converter? (it currently has the
&gt; '72-'74 exhaust, which would probably need to be swapped out to make
&gt; this work). I've heard horror stories of people fighting with the
&gt; emissions folks in California... I don't think Massachusetts is nearly
&gt; as strict.... I've gotten a sticker many times where I shouldn't have
&gt; and the inspector knew I shouldn't have.
&gt;
&gt; I know far less about vanagons than I do about busses.... but I figure
&gt; I gotta learn at some point...
&gt;
&gt; Would the easier approach be to change the VIN plate and register it
&gt; as an '83? :)
&gt;
&gt; thanks
&gt; eddie
