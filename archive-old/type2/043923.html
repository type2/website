Subject: [T2] Is a 6-ton press enough to press out ball joints?

Today I was at a tool show. You know the deal: tool vendor comes to town
with a truckload of weird tools he got somewhere and sells them very cheap.

They had some interesting items, although what I would do with a 14&quot; meat
saw and meat grinder combination I don't have any idea. (If you need one of
these, though, and you can get to Fayetteville, NC, by six tomorrow
afternoon, they had a stack of them ready to take home.) The stuff I was
looking for--the boss wants a wirefeed welder for the pressroom, and I
wanted to get a benchtop drill press to convert into a mortising machine for
woodworking--was all gone. However, they did have some hydraulic presses.

A hydraulic press is one of those tools that most guys would buy if they
knew what they were. I've been wanting a little one for a long time, but the
prospect of paying twice--once for the press, once for the UPS man--always
turned me off. They are very heavy, you see, but since they had some and you
don't pay shipping on cash-and-carry, I bought one.

This is a 6-ton hydraulic press. I know it's enough to press off CV joints
and crankshaft hardware, but is it enough for ball joints?
