Thankyou all for the advice on the intermittant starting problems on the
'71.  Will be installing the relay (the cheap one) this weekend, and
will be checking the battery cables and ground--among other things.

Another problem: just had our other '71 bus in the shop to fix a blown
oil cooler.  Cooler was replaced and new oil pressure relief valves were
installed.  Few days later they had to take the engine out again because
of a wierd shimmy in the clutch and tranny they installed--they did this
gratis.  Ran fine for a week but now is again spewing forth oil to
re-babtize the engine compartment--seems to be coming from up top by the
oil cooler again.  The guys that are working on it are pretty
responsible (DMD Enterprises, in Montclair, California;  I recommend
them, they have done right by me so far), so I am pretty sure they will
be able to take care of it, but is there something I might be able to
suggest that they check? (like they need me telling them what to
do...).   Did I just dog two coolers in a row?  Anyone ever heard of new
oil pressure relief valves being bad?

Many tanks again,

Lauria Watts
