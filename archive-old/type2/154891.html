Hi Courtney

Have a tach in our 76 2-litre dual carb.  It also fitted with an  
original rotor
button that has the centrifugal style spring in the top.  With this  
rotor the
motor will cut out at about 4200 - 4300 rpm anyway.

Your comments are just about identical to how we drive ours

I usually change up at indicated 4000 rpm maximum, often between 3500  
&amp; 4000.

If I am on the flat I wiill let it run down to about 1800 rpm in 4th  
&amp; not change down
but normally will not try to pull away in 3rd or 4th under 2000 rpm.
