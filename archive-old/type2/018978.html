The fuel pump on my 72 westy went bad, fortunatly in my driveway
(probably the result of sitting for 2 years) im considering putting in
an electric one but im looking for people's experence with these. id
think the mechanical one would draw some engine power (very little i
know, its very small) im not sure, would it make a difference? and which
is better electrical or mechanical?
