Hey List,
            I replaced my wiper switch on my 78 yesterday and when I had
finished my horn wasn't working, I checked the wire under the horn push
button and it is connected. It wasn't really working right before I replaced
the wiper switch ( only working every third or fourth push) but its
completely dead now, any ideas?

    Also the windscreen washer isn't working, this wasn't working before I
replaced the wiper switch but my old switch was really messed up, again, any
ideas?

Thanks very much in advance,

Brian Massey
