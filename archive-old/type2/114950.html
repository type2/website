&gt; Sorry guys to bother you with such an easy one but i need the bolt size on
&gt; the bottom bolt for the front shock absorbers. I cant find my hanyes manual
&gt; or i would look it up. Ball joint if that makes a difference. Im not sure if
&gt; it does. One of mine seems to have fallen off. Dont know how. thanks

It's a stud right? The nut that goes there is M10 up to 69 and M12 on later
models.
