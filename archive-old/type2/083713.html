Subject: Re: [T2] : Re: [T2] svda dizzy

&gt; huh???  how do the Fuel Injected ones work then, no carb yes the vacuum is
&gt; in the air intake flow but not part of either the Carb or Fuel injectors.

Also what about a vac only unit?
At issue is not just vac + mech but the advance curves and how they
combine. This is only properly done on a dyno under load with enough
measurements being taken. I think Aircooleds SVDA is essentially a .009
with a vac can added, and the advance curves made to conform to some
desired specification. I would be interested in actual data.
