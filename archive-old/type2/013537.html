Subject: RE: [T2] Front Axle Beam Needed
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello,

I personally have not had the guts to examine my front
beam but I have heard another solution that the list
has offered. It was to drill a hole in one end of the
beam and install a grease nipple fitting. Drill a hole
at the other end and then use a grease gun to pump the
beam full of grease until you start to see it comming
out the other end. then you can plug th other hole. Of
course this will not correct the thick rust and rust
dammage, but it sounds to be a good preventative
measure. It would take alot of grease but grease is
cheaper than a new front axle beam.

Using the por-15 that is formulated to coat gas tanks
in the beam and then pumping the axle beam full of
grease sounds to be the most full proof way of
stopping the growth of rust. The Por-15 for gas tanks
would not detoriate from the grease.

That is my $0.02 worth.

My idea was to drill two
&gt; small holes, one at the
&gt; top and the other at the bottom of each upright
&gt; where the tubes pass
&gt; through. Plug the lower hole, and using an old pump
&gt; style oil can filled
&gt; with POR 15, pump it into the cavity, remove the
&gt; plug and let it drain. I
&gt; would think this should coat the inner areas and
&gt; stop it from rusting
&gt; further.
