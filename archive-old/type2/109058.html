&gt; ...on the back side was the infamous
&gt; sticker saying it was made by EMPI...ok...big deal, except I got a real
&gt; kick out of the warning label that we are all used to seeing by
&gt; now....remember, this is on a plastic glovebox....
&gt; &quot;that is *not* legal in the state of California except for offroad
&gt; and racing vehicles&quot;.

Yep, I had to laugh when I got an Empi mug and ashtray and that sign was on
the box. When my rig is ready to travel, I think I'll at least take the mug
along!
