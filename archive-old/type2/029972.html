David, you have a reserved spot in my Advanced Placement Physics class if
you might happen to move to my area!  I need more students who aren't
scared of getting their hands dirty actually doing things!

I'm interested to see data comparing the Cd of a bus versus a bug.  From
what I've heard, the bus actually has a lower CD because VW engineered it
that way to allow them to use the bug engine with reasonable top speed.
The overall drag of a bus is greater, but this is because of the increased
cross-sectional area, not the Cd.

&gt;    hey, this is David, Rick McGuirt's son, for all those who have been
&gt; reading up on my science fair project. Below is my Abstract, which is just a
&gt; brief overveiw of the whole expirement. Sorry to disappoint some of you but
&gt; I'm only 14 and the cars were 1:32 scale models. I built a wind tunnel out
&gt; of a 12x12x48 cardboard box like you would get at Mailboxes Etc., put a
&gt; wooden frame on it for support and the drag apparatus, and a fan at the end.
&gt; I only measured the Bus and Lamborghini, but  I'll probably test the Beetle
&gt; for next years science fair. Actually, the Bus didn't have to have that much
&gt; more weight than the Lambo (you'll read about it further down). I'll have a
&gt; much more discriptive explanation of the project out later. If anyone has
&gt; any tips I'd be glad to here them. Lata.
&gt; 
&gt; Note: the formula below is supposed be to V= 8.1 x square root of tangent
&gt; theta.
&gt; 
&gt;    I did my science project on the aerodynamics of cars as tested with a
&gt; wind tunnel. What I’m attempting to show is as the wind passes over a
&gt; vehicle a vacuum is created behind the vehicle where the wind has not met
&gt; yet. The vacuum behind a vehicle creates turbulence, which slows the car
&gt; down. To prove this I built a wind tunnel. First I had to test the wind
&gt; tunnel itself to see if it was airtight. This being so, I moved on to see
&gt; which type of smoke I was to use. Since air is invisible, I used dry ice to
&gt; show the air flowing over the cars. I had everything set except for the fan
&gt; needed to pull the air through the tunnel. First I tried a shop fan, which
&gt; even set on low dissipated the vapors so much that I could not even see it
&gt; moving through the test region! I then decided to switch to a smaller
&gt; household fan. The wind was just right at the very lowest setting. I set out
&gt; to find how fast the wind was actually traveling. To find the wind
speed I
&gt; used a ping-pong ball and a protractor for the wind speed apparatus and the
&gt; formula:
&gt; 
&gt;                               V = 8.1   tan
&gt; 
&gt;    That gave me meters per second. Since we use the English system I
&gt; converted that to miles per hour..
&gt; I chose to use ‘60s era Volkswagen Bus (Van), Beetle, and a current
&gt; Lamborghini Diablo for my test vehicles. The reason being because I decided
&gt; where there isn’t structure a vacuum may be formed. For example, on the bus
&gt; there’s a straight drop off at the rear. When the air hits the end, it takes
&gt; it a long time to meet with the air flowing from the other sides of the van
&gt; and the vacuum is created here. I also made a device to measure drag using
&gt; various weights, a pivot, and a pully. After I cut the slot in the
&gt; plexi-glass window on the tunnel, I measured how much weight it took to get
&gt; the Lambo and Bus to the center of the slot and how much it took to keep it
&gt; at the center point. I found that it took .2 oz. to get the Lamborghini to
&gt; the center and .4 oz. to keep it there, whereas it took .4 to get the Bus to
&gt; the center and .6 to get it there.
&gt;    I concluded that much less turbulence is created behind a streamlined
&gt; object like the Lamborghini, which is fully structured and very aerodynamic,
&gt; rather than a bluff, flat object like the Bus.

It's interesting to note that if you cannot produce a fully tapered rear
section on a moving body (like an airplane tailcone) it is best to have
the rear end abruptly squared off.  That way, the air itself detaches
cleanly and flows smoother than if the rear had rounded corners like those
of a bus.  You might want to modify your bus model with abrupt corners on
the rear and try it again.
