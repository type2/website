&lt;&lt; Another list member pointed me to this specialized VW tool for removing
tie-rods.  It looks pretty close to the design of the one depicted in the
Bentley.

It's under $10 and for this application I want to know if it's suitable in
the opinion of other list members.  I measured the joints and I think it's
just the right fit and I'm inclined to purchase it.

Keep your receipt...As a general rule, I'm wary of most tools-by-mail;
even more so if it's from J.C. or Harbor Freight or U.S. General (are
they still around?). These guys have one criteria; price. It may look
like a duck, walk like a duck, and quack...When it breaks, or worse,
mucks up the part it's on; it's a turkey...
