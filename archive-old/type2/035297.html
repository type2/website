Gentlepersons-
                       A good starting point when looking for books 
(VW-related, or otherwise), is  &lt;www.abe_dot_com&gt;  Links to 5700 used, rare, and 
even new bookstores.
Unlike the PO of your Type 2, most of the PO's of books haven't made any 
unfathom-
able changes in them...
