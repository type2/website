Subject: putting westy pop top on 73 bus

i have a non westy 73 bus and i recently got a late 70's westy pop
top(double bed) and a folding table at a junkyard for 80 bucks. the top
needs new canvas and seals....
   my question is, can this be installed without any welding and how
would i go about supporting the bed in the rear without cutting out the
back for another piece of plywood under the main cushion... i saw some
webpage where a guy put one on a late 80's vanagon and it looked like he
just set the mattress on the sheetmetal of his van... i could make some
wood supports to even it out if theres enough clearance..(when the top
is down is there much space between it and the cushion?)
    i didnt bring the old roof back with me.. but i could go get
measurements{although its an hour away...)...however, i did notice the
first hole begins at the back edge of the front door though, so if
someone could tell me how far back from back edge of the door the first
bolt is on each of the three hinge mounts and also how wide the hole
is(distance from edge of hole to rain gutter...) i think i could get it
because it seems as though the hole ended exactly along the back edge of
the middle drivers side window.......

any help is needed.. i only have a few days before i hit the road again
thanks
ryan.
