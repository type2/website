Subject: Re: [T2] Need for middle rocker panel??

&gt; Not being a purist into show-car standards, I'm wondering what the purpose of
&gt; the middle rocker panel is for? I've got the inner, and the outer, but the
&gt; middle ones have been a little more elusive. Would I immediately go to hell if
&gt; I didn't put them in between the other two rockers? They seem to be
&gt; redundant??? Metalwiz or other bodymen, please chime in.

It is mostly there to support the slider track. On the other side it just
takes up space. And it stiffens the assembly, tying the bottom edge of the
outer into the floor. On the driver's side I'd say you could delete it
without any ill effects. Rebuilding the rockers to original is massive work
if you have to cut them out and replace all 3 pieces.
