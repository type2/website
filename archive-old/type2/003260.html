Subject: Shift Rod Bushing

Tammy, I just did this in my 69.

I can walk you through it, but first tell me which shift rod bushing you
want to replace.

There are three actually.
One really small one which goes in the ball socket at the bottom of the
shifter, then there are two along the long shift rod which runs the length
of the shift tube.

Until I get the job started, I don't really know which one is the culprit.
I'm going only by the symptoms at the moment (sloppy gear stick etc).  Since
other posts indicate that the front one is the most likely, I'll assume it's
that one and take it from there!

Thanks again

Tammy
