&gt; I am trying to install the flywheel on my new rebuilt AVP engine. But I am

&gt; 
&gt; My engine turns fine with the flywheel off. Once I put the flywheel on,
&gt; lining up the pin and lightly tightening the 5 bolts, the engine won't turn
&gt; anymore. Its as if the flywheel is fouling the case. I have not torqued the
&gt; bolts to 80ft lbs yet.

you need to set your endplay....  it will totally screw up your brand new
engine if you don't...job 17.5 pg 65/66 in the Engine Clutch chapter of
Bentley explains how to do this better than I ever could

&gt; 
&gt; I thought maybe I needes some shims. After researching the archives I see
&gt; that there should be some shims for crankshaft endplay, and I am not sure
&gt; what they look like, but on my AVP engine the main seal was already
&gt; installed and there seem to be some &quot;rings&quot; there with an o-ring over them.
&gt; I assume these are the shims and that AVP has already taken care of this.
&gt; 
&gt; Why won't my engine turn with the flywheel on? Am I missing some shims or
&gt; something. I have been reading my Bentley but am at a loss.
&gt; 
&gt; I am reusing the flywheel, the correct 210mm for my 72 Westy and although I
&gt; haven't gotten that far a new 210 Sachs clutch.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!!
