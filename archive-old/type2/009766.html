&gt;Dear Listees,
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone recommend, or does anyone have any experience in installing
&gt;auto-retracting shoulder-lap belts for the front seats in a Bay Window
&gt;bus (1971).  I am really tired of the belts we have now;  I am forever
&gt;banging the latch onto the side of our van--chip, chip, chip!  And the
&gt;things are so hard to adjust!

Information on retractible seat belt conversion has been compiled in the
