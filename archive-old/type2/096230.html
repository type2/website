&gt; I'm using a tow-dolly to pull my '73 westfalia to a

if the tranny is manual and has plenty of gear oil it should be possible
without damage, wouldn't drive fast though and make sure everything back
there is nailed down, I lost a major component I forgot was laying back
there one time

&gt; towed her forward? If I towed her backward, would the
&gt; steering wheel lock be sufficient, or should I tie the
&gt; wheel still or use the club? I appreciate everyone.

personally I wouldn't trust the steering wheellock for that.  but rather I
would turn the key and unlock the steering then use rope to tie the wheel,
that way you hit a pothole or something you don't damage anything critical
those steering wheel locks are a PITA to change
