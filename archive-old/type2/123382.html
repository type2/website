Subject: oh no tranny or clutch? &amp; thanks for info

Hi Guys,

I wanted to thank everyone for the valuable information on paint scheme: 
mexico beige/panama brown and the side vent window advice... Your help will 
definitely come in handy.

My friend has a stock 73' Westy which he bought shorty after I found my '74, 
on my advice :-(
Ran great, original...all the good stuff.

Well, he was out test driving yesterday and heard a clunk coming around the 
corner to his house.  Next it felt like someone was running along beside him 
and tossing wheel chalks underneath the tires...

The bus rolls back by hand and then suddenly stops in all gears, except 1st, 
which it will roll both forward and backwards in 1st clicking.  Neutral 
rolls and then stops as well and the clutch has absolutely no effect on 
anything.

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Tom
1974 Microbus
