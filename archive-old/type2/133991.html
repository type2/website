Subject: 71&amp;up upright case issue

i think my helper stripped out the threads on the case on the upper left in
front of the doghouse. any fix possible with the engine in? should i just
ream on through it with a longer bolt and hit it with a nut/washer in that
tight spot, or locktite?? oooph. - steve
