Sorry to have stuffed your email boxes just now. My Mac/Netscape/PacBell 
intrernet connection kept telling me that the transmission had not gone 
thru, so I kept trying. I'll verify that &quot;false negative&quot; the next time it 
happens by checking on the site directly before re-sending. Anyhow, let's 
see if we can givce Art a hand. I suppose knowing the compression readings 
would answer the question of blowby and consequent loss of mpg. Any idea 
what those are, Art?
