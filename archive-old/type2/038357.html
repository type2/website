Subject: Fast Idle Adjust

Hello listers!
	Well, the work continues on Nanook.  The engine is finished and tuned, and
the electrical is done, except for the back-up lights.  She runs and idles
beautifully (AHH THE POWER!!!! heh).  There is only one instance where I am
not happy with the idle.  That is as you first start her up.  Boy does she
race!  Then, after the warm up period, she kicks down to 900 rpm beautifully
and will sit there for the rest of the day.  I understand the importance for
a faster warm-up idle speed, but this is unhealthily fast. It must be around
3000 rpm for several minutes.
	How do you adjust the fast idle on PDSIT 34's?  I have checked the archive,
and the manuals that I have, but to no avail.  The books mention parts that
my DPSIT's don't have on them, unless I am just blind to what they are
saying.
	I know this is relatively minor problem, compared to some of the projects
on this list, but I hope someone out there will lend a helping hand.  I am
SOOOOOO happy that my bus is running now!  Now if there was just chemo and
radiation therapy that would cure bus cancer!

Thanks,
