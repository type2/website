&gt; &gt; &gt;    Hello, Don, my name is Sajit, your boss wanted me
&gt; &gt; to tell you that your job has moved here to Banga-
&gt; &gt; lore.
&gt; Our company also owns majority shares of a programming company out of
&gt; Bangalore. The guys rotate here on visas, just to practice their English I
&gt; think.
&gt;
&gt; As long as they don't get near my bus, we're all good.

heck make friends with a couple and have em bring you bus parts in thier
luggage.
