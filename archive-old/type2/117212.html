Subject: fuel pump ?'s and junk yard report

ok bus folk, on my 72 bus i have a fuel pump with an inlet and an outlet.
it is not hooked up right now but i hope to rebuild it and get rid of the
electric pump or at least keep it as an installed spare for emergencies.
while at the yard this weekend i was on a 74 (i think) bus with an auto
tranny and dual carbs.  the fuel pump on it had 3 hoses on it.  on inlet,
one going to the carbs and one that went through a hole in the tin to an
unkown place on the engine.  can i use a carb such as this.  i wasn't able
to get it as it had allen head bolts holding it down and i didn't bring my
allen wrenches and by the time i got back to the yard the next day the
engine was gone.

now for my junk yard report, they left the heat exchangers and muffler
sitting on the ground so if anyone wants them, run down and get them.  the
overhead a/c unit is still sitting in that bus where i left it after a
halfhearted attempt to remove it.  it is in great shape and would be a
quick score for someone who needs it.  again, these are at ecology in
willmington, ca.
