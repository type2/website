Subject: Re: Volkswagen Campers in Maui

We went to Hawaii for 3 weeks back in 2001.  Rented from this  guy:
 
_http://www.imua-tour_dot_com/_ (http://www.imua-tour_dot_com/) 
 
I can't remember his name right now, I want to say Jeff??, but anyway, it  
was a blast.  We used an 85 Westy on the big island for 10 days and had  such a 
great time.  There is good state parks to stay at reasonably  priced.
 
We flew from Kauai to the big island after just renting a regular car and  
camping for 10 days there.  It was great, but having the bus was  super!
 
We had a very good experience with them and couldn't recommend them  more.
 
If you decide to go to the big island let us know, we have a great journal  
and could tell you some places to hit.
 
Good luck!
 
~Jeremy
