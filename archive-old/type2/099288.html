Subject: fuel injection and stock CR

Hi everybody
I have the compression ratio on my engine adjusted to 7.1:1 
(2000cc engine). I'm replacing a weber carburetor on my bus with 
a complete fuel injection system from a '78 bus. My concern is that 
my non-stock CR might confuse the fuel injection computer. Would 
it be expecting a stock CR of 7.3:1? And if so would it cause the
engine not to run correctly? Or would everything still function
fine.
