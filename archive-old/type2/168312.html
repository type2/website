&gt; Just keep at it. It took me a while to get mine dialed in. Move the
&gt; shifter plate in 1/4&quot; increments until you're happy with it. Also, did
&gt; you grease everything up? Including the shifter plate?

I greased up the base of the shifter, ball socket, the pin and spring (after
a thorough cleaning) and the bigger spring. I did not however grease up the
shifter plate since I didn't expect it to move outside of adjustment. I
guess I will get that a little more lubed up when I get home.

Last night a worked on it for a while (while my little boy sat in his
stroller and went &quot;oooooooohhh&quot; when ever the wheels started moving - he's
1). I got the shifter to successfully shift 1-2-3 and 3-2-1, but not without
a little grinding and patience finding second both out of first and third.

I'm close, but I know that once I slather that plate up, I'm starting all
over...

This grinding thing is just really starting to get on my nerves. I want Zoey
to shift smoothly or else I will NEVER coax my wife into trying to drive
her. The shifing will scare the HELL out of her.

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
