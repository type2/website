Missy, Adam:
Yeah, especially here in the rust belt those star clip spring thingies are LONG
gone. I think there is a little rivet holding them onto the adjuster boss.  I've
never missed them, IOW, the brakes don't seem to unadjust without the clips.
Usually around here the stars rust solid pretty quickly on my 69. It's not the
stars actually rusting, they are brass,  it's the hole they go into. Almost
everytime I need to adjust the brakes, I have to pull the drums and heat them. I
very often put in new stars, they are really cheap.

&gt; similar situation....put new stars and anti-seize in the threads...put it
&gt; back in the backing plate, and is really hard to turn the stars.  I put some
&gt; grease in the hole and tried agin, but still hard to adjust.........I truly
&gt; do not think the rear brakes were EVER changed on my 73 until now........
&gt;
&gt; Any advice would be appreciated.
