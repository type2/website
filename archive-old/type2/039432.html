&gt; Check your turn signal lever. Germany requires that you can leave either
&gt; the left or right park lights on with the turn lever and with the key off
&gt; and car locked. It's a TUV thing. 

Thanks to the several folks who had ideas on what the problem was but the
solution was even stranger,,, the metal bracket that holds the bulbs in
the rear turn signals came loose on the right side and fell forward into
the engine compartment and the right turn signal + side fell against the
positive terminal of the battery !  direct connection to the positive with
the ground being still intact, but because the bulb was out of the housing
the lamp did not appear to be lite, so it wasn't until I opened the engine
compartment to disconnect the battery to work on it that I quite literally
&quot;SAW THE LIGHT&quot;  turns out only long term damage was both batteries were
flat, so they are on the charger now and I have wedged the light back into
the housing until I can do  full fledged repair, and covered the pos
terminal of the battery

thanks all
Bob
