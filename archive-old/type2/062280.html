Subject: help: new noise from '72, power problems

everyone,

my '72 westy has developed a very disconcerting noise.  

relevant info: weber 32/36 carb, 009 dist, rebuild 10k ago, compression 
120-125psi all around, valve clearances all .008&quot;, no exhaust           leaks,
vacuum steady at 17psi, noise is unaffected by timing,  anything else?

the noise ocurrs at idle and up to about 3k rpms under part throttle. 
it sounds like a clattering, but is very regular and even.  like,
tap-tap-tap-tap....  it is quite loud, and basically ovewhelms the rest
of the engine noises.  and, if i accellerate, then let off the pedal,
the noise becomes very pronounced from the cockpit and sounds sort of
like a couple of drumsticks being knocked together pretty fast.

ok, here's the kicker:  sometimes, at idle, it does not make the noise
at all.  it seems as though if it is at just the right point, it wont do
it--sounds nice and smooth, like it used to.  but, if i give it gas, the
noise immediately returns.

accompanying problems (related?):  there is a really bad flat spot just
off idle if it is given gas suddenly--like bad enough that stuff shoots
out of the carb and the engine sometimes shuts down (i have been told
this is a jetting problem), the mileage seems to have become worse since
this noise started.

please help me on this--i have done all i know how to do!

thanks in advance
