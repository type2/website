Be happy yer not in some parts of Europe where if caught driving such a
vehicle with &quot;lemon sized&quot; holes, your vehicle would be impounded off-road
until they were fixed.

Price of a Drag Link is around $49.50 (Parts Only), depending where ya shop,
give or take $5.  Good Quality of course.  Some we've receive from
importer/suppliers have been sent back due to poor quality boots and tie rod
ball joint movement.

There's junk out there,  so *beware*
