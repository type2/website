&gt; bars.  Only failed to work once when the bolt was sloppy to start and rounded
&gt; out when I tried to take it off.  Then I tried a 12 point socket and breaker bar
&gt; - big mistake, rounded it even worse.  Finally used a cold chisel to mangle the
&gt; bolt, hammered my cross bar onto it and got it of.  The cross bar show no signs
&gt; of distress after all this, so I re-iterate, that a good, sturdy cross bar is
&gt; the best tool for removing lugs when you have no impact wrench.  (I have seen
&gt; cross bars that were springy and wimpy that would have cringed at the abuse mine
&gt; has seen).

The owner of the VW shop I used to work at showed me a trick. Take the biggest hammer
you can find and hit the lug nut square on the face two or three times before you try
to break it loose.  This always worked for me.
