Hi list,

im in mobile, al, I have a 76 westy , the body is gone , i quit running it
aobut 7 years ago, the engine is out, i had an oil leak and i was tired of
the 2L scene so i gave up on it, anyway, there are still aton of useable
parts there, camper stuff , etc,  the engine is rebuildable, but a bit
weathered,  it was running when i took it out, tranny is still good,

does anybody on the list want it? i will trade it for just about anything
bug or split window bus , or even give it to ya if  thats what you want,
email me

jb
