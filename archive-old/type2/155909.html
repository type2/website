Subject: Re: [T2] Lifters / Rocker Arms - Adjusting?

Where to start...

1. Clean oil means clean engine. So it should be clean inside if it's
a fresh rebuild. Even an old engine if well maintained can look
spotless.
2. There shouldn't be much oil in the valve covers. It drains back
down the pushrod tubes into the sump.
3. Don't just tighten the rockers.

What engine did you get? Does it have hydraulic lifters? If you aren't
sure, ask your builder. Because if you adjust solids like hydraulics
you get burnt valves and zero compression.

This is a pretty decent writeup on adjusting valves:
http://www.vwtrendsweb_dot_com/tech/0106vwt_valve_adjustment/

For solid lifters, adjust all valves to .006&quot;.
For hydraulic lifters, adjust all valves to 1-2 turns past contact.
(My 78 gets 1 1/2 turns and seems happy there.) That means back the
head out until it's loose, then slowly tighten until you feel
resistance. Then count turns from there.

You might want to check with your builder about this too. There may be
some warranty considerations...
