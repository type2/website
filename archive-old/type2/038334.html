You don't have to take the plastic rivets out at all. Unless you are replace 
the levers. Only thing you have to do is undo the freshair vents and the 
heater cables. The best way to do this is to take your radio out and undo the 
springs. Then push the rods and cables threw the holes on the levers. This 
will save you time and you won't have to worry about breaking the heat and 
freshair levers plus you don't have to replace the rivets this way.
