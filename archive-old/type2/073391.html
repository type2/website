I know this isn't quite the right list for this, but here goes...

i just got a call from a guy who's selling an '86 westy here in boston. we
have the same VW mechanic, who apparently told him that i'm looking for a
camper [but i want a '78].

I haven't see this, so i can't say for sure what it's like.

'86 Westy, $8900. He says it's really nice.
617,492.1878
His name is Andy
