Subject: Break-in

Happy Saturday People,

Well I just finished the 1000 mile break-in on my AVP rebuild, barely in
time for a road trip up the PCH on the Cali coast. Everything's good so
far...I've made several thorough inspections and found several loose things,
including a lower engine-to-tranny nut. Also a CV fell off due to lack of
lock washers and spacers...they weren't there when I bought it &gt;:0(

I'm a little unclear on what my break-in responsibilities are after 1000
miles. Is moderate highway driving OK? Do I still need to vary speed/rpm
continually?

Also while doing the valves today I noticed that the retaining spring on the
rocker arm assembly on cylinders 1 &amp; 2 is not clamped down at the #1 intake
rocker. It's just kind of hanging out. It is clamped near the other rockers
on that side and near all the rockers on the 3&amp;4 side. Is this a potential
problem? Would it be a huge project to undo the rocker and try to secure it?

Thanks,
RickG
