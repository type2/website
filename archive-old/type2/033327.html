Subject: Transmission rebuilders (AAtransaxles)

Hello All,

Looking for a rebuilt transmission for my '68 bus.  Saw a webpage for AA 
transaxle in  Duvall, WA (Seattle area).  Their prices are kind of high ($600 
vs. $450 at Bus depot and others), but they advertise a 3 year unlimited 
mileage warranty.  Does anyone have any experience with this shop and/or its 
products?
