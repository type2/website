Well... I finally make it to colorado springs late Monday night.  yes... husband packed the computer for me to bring with me.  But I nearly froze driving here, so I have a few questions.  I have installed the pop-top seal, and the flat seal (that goes on top between the luggage rack and the pop-top) but for some reason, it has a really big draft, just like having the window open.  Is there any way to seal this so it will not freeze the people in the back? How about the luggage rack seal?  I was told it was not really a seal, but.. could it be causing this..... as I have not yet replaced it. any help would be appreciated, as I may be taking my grandson home with me and he would freeze.
thanks
