Subject: 1800 into early 80van -feasability?
Message-ID: &lt;6ed51c82.248f41a5_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I'm want to help this early eighty vanagon from rusting to death in a field, 
but I find that my 80 block needs the most work (I can see a faint GEX stamp 
near the seam), but lacking $$$$,  I have a better prospect in a 74 1800, or 
perhaps a 78 hydraulic, which would be the better switch? Is cutting the 
input shaft and changing the bellhousing apply for the switch from 74 to 80, 
as it supposedly does for 74 to 76-79....?

Also, would this be a stupid move because I'd cut the unique transmission 
(with some sort of side mechanism) and prevent it from accepting a 2000 motor 
once I had it together.. ?

I'd appreciate any advice.
