Subject: Horn saga ends for now!

After much work on the horn on the 72 Station Wagon this weekend, I gave up
and admitted defeat for the short term. After trying darn near every jumper
combination possible, putting a new wire into the steering column, and doing
a lot of head scratching, the horn is still grounding out somewhere along
the steering column. There's a rubber bushing between the steering column
and steering tube which may be causing the problem, which will necessitate a
trip to the bus graveyard. In the meantime, in order to get it legal for
Texas inspection (requires a horn), I attached a button to the steering
tube. Ran one wire to the ground terminal of the horn, the other wire to the
base of the steering tube, essentially using the steering tube as the hot
wire, even though it's supposed to be the ground. That's what a short will
do for you. Works like a champ, but I will not keep on there long, I hope.

Anyway, this should allow me to get legal so I can drive it out to the
annual Thanksgiving campout. It's first family road trip with us...
