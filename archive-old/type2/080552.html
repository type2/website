Subject: Re: [T2] wheel cease

Emergency brakes frozen (rust) to the drums...

&gt;Hello all,
&gt;
&gt;I have a '72 Kombi in *running* condition. I left it for two or three 
&gt;weeks over winter (no extreme cold, just wetness so far as the weather 
&gt;went) and now it will not move. The engine will run and sounds and works 
&gt;fine, but it is as if there are imaginary blocks behind the drive wheels. 
&gt;I gave it some gas in reverse and the right rear went &quot;clunk&quot; and I could 
&gt;feel the resistance go away from that wheel. But, no matter what i try the 
&gt;left rear is locked. Is it ceased? Could it be transmission or brake related?
