&gt; After all, VW certainly didn't do a dynamic balance of these engines

&gt; miles than that on their new vehicles.

The logic, as I see it, is this:

(1) Any rebuild (as opposed to a completely new engine) puts together 
parts that have been stressed at different times in different ways, 
some of them over a 30-year period.

(2) A Volkswagen AC engine does not have the robust characteristics of 
a watercooled engine of the same vintage with cast iron block and head.

(3) Dynamic balancing reduces, by some percentage and according to the 
law of averages, the additional stress on the already stressed older 
parts of the engine -- which includes all the parts that have been 
reground and reconditioned.

Doesn't that sound right?
