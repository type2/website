Hello all,
I am the proud new owner of a 79 bus, and I have had a big smile on my face
every time I drive her.

However, last night, I was showing her off to some friends when I started
her up A new and concerning noise arose from the engine area.   It reminds
me of a noise from my childhood when I would place a playing card in the
spokes of my bike.

Though I pride myself on my ability to repair and maintain nearly all I own.
I am not familiar at all with the workings of my bus.  I have been lurking
on the list and reviewing all the material I find to educate myself as
quickly as possible although I do not have a clue as to what is happening to
my bus.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Bryan
