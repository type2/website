&gt; I brought the fridge unit out of my '74 Westy to a local refrigeration

&gt; my bus about 6 years ago... and mostly has sat in the basement. They
&gt; said it was too old a system to work on and quoted me $700 to get all
&gt; the inner workings replaced.... needless to say that isn't gonna happen.

mine didn't work and I was told to try this, might work, might not but it
doesn't cost anything to try.

  take the fridge and turn it upside down, leave it that way for a couple
days. turn it right side up, and try it...
