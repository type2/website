Subject: Tightening Head bolts w/engine in bus

OK, I just realized what an idiot I am.  I installed my engine w/the new 
head, and I have 0 compression on both cylinders (1 &amp; 2).  It turns out 
that my torque wrench reads ft-inches, and so I torqued the head bolts to 
22 ft inches vs. 22 ft lbs.  Not too smart.  It appeared to me that the 
setting was too low, but having never done this before I just went about my 
merry way w/o noticing the scale issue.

Is there anyway to torque the upper bolts w/o dropping the engine 
again.  Obviously, I can get to the 4 bolts under the rocker arm, si it is 
a question of hitting those bolts hidden by engine tin.

TIA.
