Hey open windows are best, just trying to make something out of this old 
laptop rather than throw it away. The motherboard is dead but the screen is 
good.

Before you have a stroke over this consider the uses - a REALLY mobile TV, 
uses less space and power than a regular TV.

Resolution would be crummy but hey it's free and for temporary uses only.

It can be used in the car, on the porch, and to preview home videos while 
away from home.

And we happen to really like to share a movie and with our mixed work 
schedules - if the only time we can do it together is on a weekend while 
we're camping - then so be it.

Yes campfire stories are better, counting stars are better, and watching 
deer is better but sometimes you're running 60 mph with a kid that would 
prefer not be running 60 mph and sometimes it rains and you can't be 
outside. And sometimes you meet out of state friends somewhere in the 
middle and share home movies and you gotta have a screen for that too.

Yes Wal-mart and their cousins have $100 TV/VCR combos but I'm tinkering 
here not actually working towards a solution! &lt;grin&gt;

Oh - what am I thinking - who cares what anybody else thinks - I drive 
a  20+ year old aircooled VW Westy and so I think it's obvious I'm a little 
wierd!!!

Just blowing a bit of steam. Thanks to ALL that responded.

Just poking at you George!
