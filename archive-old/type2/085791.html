Bob

Pulling the tank fire wall with the engine installed is closer to hell than 
I want to get.

&gt;I have replaced the sender in my 78 twice without drilling any holes or

&gt;
&gt;YES it is a very tight fit but it is possible and can be done,  check the
&gt;archives for some of the tricks

&gt; &gt; Willis,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have had two Vans (70 and 77) that have had access holes cut above the
&gt; &gt; fuel tank sender by previous owners. The 70 had two pretty ham handed 
&gt;holes.
&gt; &gt; The first was off target.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have pulled a gas tank on a 77 Bus and it was no fun but I share your
&gt; &gt; sense of danger in cutting metal above the tank. I would drain it and 
&gt;blow
&gt; &gt; air thu it until all fumes were gone. Also get the location information 
&gt;with
&gt; &gt; out cutting test holes.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Hey,
&gt; &gt; &gt;has anybody done the replacement without pulling the engine, like the
&gt; &gt; &gt;archives suggest.
&gt; &gt; &gt;The guy says to cut a hole in the body to access it and re cover it 
&gt;with a
&gt; &gt; &gt;plastic screw on boat hatch.
&gt; &gt; &gt;sounds risky to me, but I'd like to know for sure how much gas I have, 
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt;needle drops to R after I have a half tank or less.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Also does anybody know a good replacement for the rear table leg on 
&gt;76-79
&gt; &gt; &gt;westys?
&gt; &gt; &gt;I'm considering buying a peice of conduit and bending it, but don't 
&gt;know
&gt; &gt; &gt;the diameter or height to bend at.
