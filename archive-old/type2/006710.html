&gt;
&gt; &gt;Recent discussions about torqueing head bolts makes me wonder. Nearly
&gt; &gt;evertime I adjust my valves, usually 2,000-2,500 miles, they are tight.
&gt; Like
&gt; &gt;I can't even get the .006 in there tight. Not always all of them, but
maybe
&gt; &gt;6 out of the 8. Any reason why this would be? The SIR ruibld has about
&gt; &gt;12,0000 miles on it now, but the same was true of my old engine. I was
told
&gt; &gt;they would be tight as it breaks in.
&gt;
&gt;     I had tight valves on an engine with brand new VW heads, ended up that
&gt; the heads had bad seats from the factory.  Had to have a valve job, new
&gt; seats and new exhaust guides after less than 10K miles.  Been fine since
&gt; then.
&gt;
&gt;     Anybody else getting bad seats from new Brazilian heads? (1600 DP)
