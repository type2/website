Subject: [T2] Finished installing my radio

Sally now has a new radio, just in time for Christmas.  Many thanks to all
the listees who responded to my question about the door speakers.  I
installed some Pioneer TS-C1302 component speakers (5 1/4 inch woofers +
1/2 inch dome tweeters).  There were already holes in the doors for the
woofers, made by a PO.  The holes were a little big for my purposes but not
a bad fit.  I mounted the tweeters up in the top front corners of the
doors, in front of the window winder handle.  They came with in line
filters, as opposed to crossovers, and I just had to connect the other side
of the filter to the main units along with the wire coming from the radio.
The radio is a Sony MDX-C6500R mini disc unit.  I had to open up the hole
in the dash in the usual way but this was no problem with my trusty Dremel.
I took the power from fuse 9 as this doesn't seem to be used for anything
else.
For wiring I just used the wire that came with the kit, and an ISO adapter
cable, which means that in theory I can just unplug the radio and plug
another in if I want.  I used 'proper' uninsulated crimp terminals but
soldered them as I don't have a 'proper' crimp tool and put heatshrink over
everything.
While I had the doors apart I put 4 sq ft of Dynamat in each, not cheap but
I couldn't find anything similar that would have the same effect.  Before,
the doors used to go 'clangggg', now they go 'thunk'.
In all this took about 3 days, and I'm very happy with the result.  In fact
it sounds even better than I expected it would.  We're going on a long trip
to my folks next Friday, so it will get a good high speed test.  I haven't
got any rear speakers yet because I plan to build a new overhead rear
locker (when the weather is warmer) and the speakers will go in there.
Hope you all have a great Christmas and new year.
