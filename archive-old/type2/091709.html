Subject: Re: [T2] Swamp cooler source(s)?

Craig,
Check out E-Bay from time to time--
I have seen floor mount accessory swamp coolers there from time to time.
I just sold a genuine VW accessory cooler about 6 months ago--NOS to be
exact---

They do work good out west, but here in the Windy city at 99 percent
humidity--all it did was cause my bus to be a rolling greenhouse--

Itheld about 2 gallons of water, had a compartment in the rear of it for
ice--and a compartmentin front to keep a couple of cans of a beverage of
your choice cool--and also had a tansformer, so it could be carried in
to a no-AC motel---

Prety neat and unusual item---

Keep an eye on E- Bay

Later,

Terry

List, 
I know this is at least an annual run but, does anyone remember who
makes and/or sells the different swamp coolers (evaporative coolers)
that are small enough for our buses? Seems there was a vent-mounted
model and one that sat between the two front seats? Any help
appreciated...
