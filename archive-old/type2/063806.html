Subject: oil leak

Ok
So The guy decided not to but my my Super Beetle and I think
I decided to just keep it. But we will see. I crawled under the
bus today to check out the oil leaks. The bus has been parked
in the garage for over a week so the puddles were pretty big.
This is a type 4 motor. So I am wondering what might be
specificaly leaking if both puddles accumulated under the 
front ( closest to the front of the bus) of the heater boxes.
The each spread out in a line from front to back. This is not
of immediate concern because it looks like the bus will be
spending most of the upcoming winter sitting, unless some
miracle happens along and I get some extra $. But with 2
kids and twins on the way it is not likely. So that is 
my rambling for today, we'll see what tomarrow brings.....
