1k in 4years?!?!?

fuel lines
brake lines
tires???
battery
drain all the fuel, and refill and change the fuel filter
change the oil filter and change the oil.
change the points and plugs


take your time, slow and easy.
make sure your AAA card is handy
take tools, Bentley, sleeping bag and some food and water.
cell phone
camera, document the bus before you start out.
a pocket full of $$$$$

if you have a friend that can ride behind you in another vehicle so much
