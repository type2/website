Subject: [T2] Trailer hitches and brake boosters

Hey all, just thought I would let everyone in on a couple recent finds.  I
must have called 20 different local places looking for a trailer hitch for
my 80 Vanagon.  Well I found a place www.hitch-web_dot_com that has a class 1
hitch rated at 1500 lbs.  Anyone know the towing capacity for an 80 Vanagon
off hand?  It cost about $130 and it is a bolt on deal.  It bolts on to the
tie-down straps (it actually kind of sandwiches them) which are welded to
the bumper mounts.

Same deal with the brake booster. I called several places and either they
wanted way too much or I had to send off my booster to have it rebuilt.
Well turns out www_dot_carparts_dot_com has them.  It is not in their online catalog
but you have to talk to a &quot;online parts specialist&quot; and he will find it for
you.  Mine was $125 (rebuilt of course, with $30 core).  Just thought I
would throw those out to the list.

I haven't posted in a while as school has me as busy as a $25/hour mechanic.
Can't believe how many posts this list is getting a day now.  Must be
getting hectic for the Admins :). I am hoping to take Klunk up north
sometime in December.  It will be his first out-of-state trip since I have
owned him.  I will probably be headed to N.C. to visit some friends.
Hopefully there will be a VW event or two going on somewhere in my path.
