Subject: AARGGGHHH!!! A cracked head at only 24K miles.

Hi Volks,

So I just learned what a new expensive bus sound sounds 
like. A cracked head sounds like loud valves on one 
side, or maybe like an exhaust leak. Like a hole in your 
muffler, but when you inspect the hole is in a head 
instead. This sucks!

I wasn't driving my bus real hard or real hot or real 
heavily loaded, just cruising around town. But now I've 
got a cracked cylinder head. By exhaust valve #2. Time 
to drop the engine AGAIN and replace the %*&amp;! thing.
24K since my last top to bottom rebuild. 

Don't need any advice I think, Just venting.

Grumble, grumble,
