&gt;I am sorry but I am pretty sure you would have to balance a piston closer to the &quot;X&quot; amount of grams that a dime weighs. If you 

IIRC, a quarter weighs five grams (been a long time since I read Muir).  Factory spec for 
balancing pistons is &quot;within 10 grams&quot;.  Since a dime weighs less than a quarter and  
since I wasn't building a race motor, getting them to weigh &quot;the same&quot; within the 
margin of error involved with the average weight of a dime was close enough.  I built 
that engine with 95% used parts (new rings, exhaust valves &amp; valve springs) and got 
60k miles out of it before an oil pump failure killed it .. far more than I was expecting.

I was relating my experience to others on the list with the idea that someone might 
appreciate the creative solution I came up with given the tools, equipment and finances
available at the time, nothing more.
