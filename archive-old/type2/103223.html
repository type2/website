&gt; I saw a bus the other day and displayed in the instrument cluster on the fuel

Richard,

&gt; What does this light do?

It lights up!

&gt; Is it like the EGR light than needs to be reset after
&gt; 15,000 miles?------------

Yes, it is just like the egr light, controlled by a &quot;mileage meter&quot; box in
the speedo cable run. I have a CA bus, and it has the OXS lamp. I am not
sure about the reset interval for the OXS type, but if I was guessing, I
would guess also 15k miles.
