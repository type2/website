Subject: Re: [T2] where to put spare on 77 westy ?

Well, there are a lot worse things to worry about accident-wise in a  bus than a front-mounted spare.  I'm thankful that mine doesn't  have the power that I'm used to in the many sports cars I've  owned.  Makes me extra careful.  Unfortunately, the bus is  probably one of the most dangerous vehicles to be in in a serious  crash.  But then I ride motorcycles (Ok, I am currently  motorcycleless but hopefully only temporarily) and fly hang  gliders.  You just have to be willing to accept the risk.   And be extra careful.  The good visibility of the bus is a  definite plus.  But I almost got whacked in the side yesterday due  to my inattention.  With most cars riding so low, you would  probably be ok even in a side-on collision, IF you're wearing your  seatbelt, which I have a hard time making myself do.  I'm going to  have to install retractables.  One of my cars had the automatic  seat belts.  Don't remember which one.  Must have been the  Renault.  But after I got used to
 it, I liked it.  I'm not  ambitious enough to figure that one out in the bus.  Not that I  would anyway.  But be extra careful driving a thirty-plus year old  vehicle designed for rural, recreational use.  They are dangerous  compared to modern vehicles.   But hey, I gave up heat and  power and gained a vehicle that is more like a second home; guess I can  sacrifice the airbags.   JMHO....KR

the back of the High Top.

Everyone I spoke with (all bus mechanics and body people) said that  
mounting on the nose would cause severe damage even if someone only  
bumped into you at 5 mph. Or if I bumped into someone, of course. I  
even have the bumper over-riders in front, and they wouldn't stop an  
impact on the nose-mounted wheel.

While it may look cool, given the lack of driving skills for many  
road warrior-wannabes here in Charleston, I just don't want to deal  
with the potential hassle.
