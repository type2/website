Hello all,

        I have a stupid question, so what's new you ask? Well, as the
subject states, my bus is ticking. I adjusted the valves and it then
decided to make this new noise. The question is did I adjust them
correctly? I did it in the morning, before waking her up. This is how,
found when #1 is in firing position, adjusted so there was .006
clearance, hand turned the engine till #4 was in firing position, did
same as before, and so on. Sorry about being so green, but I can't help
it. I also have another question, not quite as stupid. She finally found
a name for herself, The Sloth. Any hints on a good naming ritual? P-mail
me and I will post results.

Thanks,
Nate
71 Loaf &quot;The Sloth&quot;
