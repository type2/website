Subject: Re: [T2] Oil substance leaking at rapid rate ---UPDATE

I suggest in each case only one man/woman/it do the procedure. That would 
separate the men from the....well, the others. And just because one way 
seems to save a bit of time, it doesn't necessarily mean that's the right 
way to do it for everyone in every case. Getting panicy about makin' time 
with 200 pounds of motor over your head should be avoided at all costs. 
Keep your heads or you can crush some important bones.

&gt; &gt; Whoops!  You are correct!  OH, boy... this complicates things... I sense
&gt; &gt; an upcoming outbreak of religious warfare between the engine-only and
&gt; &gt; engine-trans pulling schools :-)
&gt;
&gt;Steven, you and the Everybus attendees can help end this schism once and for
&gt;all with a Fun Contest.
&gt;
&gt;Start by fixing Troy's Bus.
&gt;
&gt;Then let the engine-only people pull and reinstall Troy's engine. Time the
&gt;drop &amp; reinstall.
&gt;
&gt;Finally, let the engine-trans people pull and reinstall his engine. Once
&gt;again, time the operation.
&gt;
&gt;Whoever gets the engine in and out the fastest (demerits for squishing team
&gt;members under the engine) Knows The One True Way.
