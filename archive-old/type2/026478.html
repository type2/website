&gt;you can buy predrilled sump plates

WHAT??  And miss the opportunity to destroy several perfectly good ones
while using every curse you ever learned (and maybe make up a few new ones)?
Pass up yet another opportunity to drink lots of beer, cut your fingers,
wrap your latex gloves around a huge drill bit before remembering what you
told yourself just last week (&quot;Don't wear latex gloves while operating
electric drills!&quot;), and then run to 750 sympathetic fellow listees with your
tales of woe?  SACRILEGE!!!

Seriously though, I didn't know you could buy them.  Any suggestions as to
where (and how many $$)?

Thanks.
