have you looked to see what the cost of a rebuild kit is for that
weber? While I&quot;m not a huge fan of these guys, unless you know it's
shot (worn throttle shafts etc) then a rebuild might be all it needs. 
if it works it sure would be the least expensive route. That way you
can save your money for either a fi or carb system later that will
work better on the engine.

&gt; So, is it possible to put a common carb like the 34PICT-3 on the single
&gt; (formerly Weber progressive) setup?  What other options (especially
&gt; single carb) would exist for these later 70 model 2000cc engines?

I would think you would have a tough time finding an adapter to make
that work.
