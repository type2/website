&gt;Well, they didn't re-tool just for that. They also re-tooled for those few
&gt;months to produce a one-year-only wider bay-window body, if I remember
&gt;right.

Did we ever get a definitive answer on that?  Did anyone actually
measure it with a tape measure.  This is so totally unimaginable to me
that... I can't even imagine it.  I think it must have been a
difference in federal reporting requirements or something--instead of
measuring the bus' width from end of bumper to end of bumper, they
were required to include the mirrors in &quot;normal&quot; position or some such
silliness.

Just think: 79-only bumpers, windshield, rear window hatch &amp; glass,
headliner, floor mats, rear seat; the mind reels.  It *can't* be true,
it simply *can't* be!

Still in denial,
Rodney
