Subject: How to cut in for fuel gauge,bus

Gregor and Type2 list, took me a while, but here is protocol from VW itself
on replacing gas tank sendor in bus:

Subj:  How to replace fuel tank sending unit...easily!!!

...well, *relatively* easily anyway...i received the relevent excerpt
from the _Type_2_Repair_Manual_ which does indeed discuss how to
replace the fuel tank sending unit, *without* removing the engine...
that's right, Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft actually authorizes
this type of repair, although i accept no responsibility *whatsoever*
if you undertake this renovation yourself...i have *not* yet tried
this, nor even checked the measurements in my bus to determine that they
do indeed land on the floor (from the picture they give it *seems* that it
would land on the back deck, not what i consider the floor of the vehicle);
nor have i confirmed that this will work for every year Type II.

&gt;From Section 90.4:

      The sender unit can be removed without taking out the engine, bulkhead
and fuel tank.  This is done by cutting a hole in the floor plate which is
then closed afterwards with a plate available as a spare part.

      WARNING:  Do not use any of the following tools to cut the hole or clean
edges:  Gas torch, grinding disc, parting disc.

 - Disconnect battery ground cable.
 - Cut hole and remove burrs. [See diagram below for placement]

                    REAR VIEW
{ascii reproduction of figure appearing in manual}

[The following steps are for making a fancy cover to put over the hole;
 a lazy person like myself would probably skip them &amp; use duct tape
 instead...and why not, as so many other things in my bus are duct-taped :]

 - Cut into the rib at front and rear edge of hole about 15mm (0.59in) and
   hammer rib flat.  Support metal from underneath with a strong lever.
 - Check that the plate and seal fit properly.  To ensure that the plate
   seals properly, the hole should be lifted slightly around the edge.
 - Place the cover over the whole, mark off the hole positions on the floor
   plate and drill 3mm (1/8in) diameter holes.

[...getting back to the important stuff...]

 - Renew fuel gauge sender unit.
 - Connect up the battery ground strap and check operation of sender unit.
 - Stick seal to plate and secure plate with tapping screws [or cover with
   cardboard and duct tape, just like you did with those holes behind the
   wheel wells :O ].
