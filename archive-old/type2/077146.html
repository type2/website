What did they cost you?

&gt;Howdy,
&gt;I have a 78 westy with early 80s (not sure of the exact year, pulled from a
&gt;wrecking yard) vanagon seats. If I remember correctly, they slipped right in
&gt;without a problem . I did, however, remove the armrests because in the forward
&gt;position they crowded the aisle and did not allow the passenger seat to be
&gt;reversed (door clearance problems) for camping. I removed the armrests and the
&gt;mounts (requires cutting/grinding) when I reupholstered. They look and work
&gt;great.
