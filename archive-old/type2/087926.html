Man, oh man...=20
  Now I am going through some kind of internal conflict. I stripped this =
old '79 Westy pretty good, but the wheels are still on it. I was going =
to cut off the top and do a &quot;Bob the Tomato&quot; job on another of my buses. =
Well, that was the original plan.. But I always try to think these =
things through before doing something irreversable.. and life has a way =
of throwing you an occasional red herring. Nothing has gone wrong with =
the plan, mind you, except that I kept looking at this '79 and admiring =
certain features about it. I like the improved step up into the cab, and =
the stronger nose behind the bumper.. That long, squarish tube-looking =
thing that supports the bumper. This Westy has rust, but not terminal. =
It's all coming from the top down.. good floors, frame and rocker =
panels. It's a California bus. A little around the base of the =
windshield, which is pretty normal for an older bus, but the rest of it =
is inside the ventilation channels up top and the gutter system and rear =
hatch. Well, this is all stuff that can be replaced with donor material. =
I've already given thought to how I would go about it. And I might have =
a donor.=20
Remember the '78 with rustibus with the good engine and tranny for $800? =
I never did make an offer on it. Well, I have been looking at that =
darned thing for over ten days now, and I's been slowly getting under my =
skin. I told my self last night, &quot;No way, I'm going to get involved in =
another project&quot;. I thought that had settled it. But alas, I had made =
the mistake of going out and test driving it. That engine ran pretty =
darned sweet.. That bus is impressively fast, powerful, with super =
responsive acceleration. I'm sure that it's nowhere near running as good =
as it could with some maintenance.=20
So, why do you think I've been asking all these questions about FI's and =
fuel efficiency? Like I said, I thought I had it pretty much settled =
that I wouldn't mess with this one, but it's still eating at me. So, =
just now I got the nerve to call the guy back, and he tells me that it =
got towed. He says he's going to cash his paycheck tomorrow and go down =
to try to get it out, but if for some reason he can't, he tells me that =
I can go down there and he'll just give me the pink. He says he'd rather =
see anyone get it but them. Well, it's only going to have about a $50.00 =
tow bill and two days' storage on it. Let's see what happens. They towed =
it because the registration was expired, and they'll probably want that =
paid, too. It's only expired by a few months.=20
The fact that I've pretty much stripped the Westy doesn't bother me. If =
I was going to restore it, that would fit right into the plan.. All the =
closer to prepping and painting. Winter is coming, but I have a nice, =
dry garage to put it into. I could have it ready for spring and another =
camping trip.=20
It would be a shame, anyway, to let that engine go for scrap, and that's =
probably what would happen to it. Since you fellas have been telling me =
that they're really not so hard to work on, and super reliable, maybe =
it's worth messing with. Anyhow, I have a feeling that the price will be =
unbeatable.  Jan B
ps... I would appreciate any thoughts on the matter. I don't need to be =
told I'm crazy. I know it and every body I know knows it. But it seems =
that my bus addiction has reached the point where these things seem to =
be following me home.. Or is that the bus god &quot;Kokopele&quot;, playing tricks =
on me, again? LOL.=20
