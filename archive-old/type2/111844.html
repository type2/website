Subject: Re: [T2] Where is the heater blower switch?

&gt; Re:1976 Westy....Where/(what does it look like)
&gt; is the dash switch that activates the heater
&gt; blower motor, and how does the switch work?
&gt; I have read that the switch is behind the
&gt; dash, near the (2 red) levers that 
&gt; operate the flapper cables.

Yes, that's right, that is where the switch is. If you
take out the instrument panel then you can see much
easier how it works.

Just pull out the levers, disconnect the speedo-cable
and take the four screws out. It is wise to disconnect
the battery cable before you remove the
instrumentpanel. The metal plates in which the screws
are mounted may drop when you loosen the screws. If
they drop on the wiring you might get a short-circuit.
