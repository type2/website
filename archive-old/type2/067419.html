Subject: Re: 1800cc engine on a -72?

Hi Johannes,
  As far as I can see there should be no problem, as long as it's a
carbureted engine. I have a 73 bus that had the same 1700cc engine, and I
swapped it for an 1800cc last year. Pops right in, no problems. Both engines
were carbureted. The clutches are identical. I'm glad I did that, got some
free horsepower out of it... If the 1800cc is fuel injected you may have
problems, because of all those electrical leads you'd have to install. Of
course it couls be done I suppose, but in that case I would definitely put
in the 2000cc engine...
  Enjoy the swap,
                    Gregor

                    &gt; like the subject says i have a - 72 van with an
engine bleeding
out all &gt; of its oils (thru crank axle's gasket(sp?)) and i've been offered
&gt; 1800cc engine, i guess 1800cc engine can be used on a -72 type2?
