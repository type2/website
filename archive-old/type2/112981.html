Subject: Re: [T2] propane powered type2's - any further info on this?

Thanks for the info Dave, I'm going to keep checking into this, it's very
interesting to me, and since it's less polluting as well as half the price,
how can we lose??
Regards,
Courtney

 

 
Courtney,

The guys on the megasquirt list have discussed it off and on...and I 
believe that someone actually did it....I haven't been watching that list 
as closely lately cause I am working hard trying to get my bus ready for 
Eureka Springs...and they generate about 3 times more mail than we do!
