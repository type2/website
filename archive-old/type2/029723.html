&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't have that big black knob to adjust the drivers seat.  I feel as I

&gt; A friend just drove my 68 this past weekend and he thought the smaller black
&gt; knob slid the seat back (as I did the first time) and the plastic knob came
&gt; off in his hand.  Glad to know now what it really does.  Mine does not stay
&gt; in both positions.  Is it supposed to stay put on either end of the throw?
&gt; The P.O. put carpet down that covers the walkthrough.  If I lift it up,
&gt; where is the vent?  I'd like to uncover it.

It's on the floor between the seats even with the rear side of the
bulkhead.  The floor steps down a bit, leaving a vent opening.

&gt; I also found a similar knob under the dash behind the fiberboard cover.
&gt; Another vent control?  For what?

Might be for the defroster.  Does it flip up and down?  If so, down is
defrost, up sends the air out of the vents onto your feet.

&gt; On to the seat:  Mine is broken although the big knob does in fact move one
&gt; side of the seat back (the other side just floats loosely).  How do I remove
&gt; the seat to either fix or replace it.  Obviously it's not as easy as the
&gt; passenger seat.  Thanks,

Actually, it's easier.  Use the seat release knob and push the seat all
the way forward off of its tracks.
