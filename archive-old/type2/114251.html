Subject: RE: [T2] Overhead Consoles

&gt;&gt;  And truthfully, the idea of a digital compass is
&gt;&gt;pretty exciting, too.

&gt;I've held off on that for a couple of reasons.  Cost is a factor though it
&gt;wouldn't be if I could be convinced that it will work well.  Has anyone
&gt;tried one?  Finally my granddad gave me a black metal tank compass that
&gt;would look really cool mounted to the top of the dash - I may just use
&gt;that.

I have an electric one that I purchased at Sam's Club for $60.  It has the
same technology that is used by GM in their cars.  It works great.  It also
gives inside and outside temperature, altitude and barometric pressure.  The
compass is very accurate, the only downside is that it needs to be
calibrated about once every two weeks.  Not hard to calibrate, you just have
to drive the bus around in circles for about a minute.  I really like it.
The one that I purchased came with suction cups to mount to the window and
it looks pretty cool sitting up just barely over the dash.

The problem that I had with traditional compasses in the bus was that due to
the amount of metal that the bus has a traditional compass wouldn't always
give me a good reading.  There were times that I could be going due south
and my compass would say that I was going southeast.  I don't have any of
those problems with the electric one.
