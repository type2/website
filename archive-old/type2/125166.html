Subject: Re: [VB] shift knobs

True story,
I know a guy who had just got his new bus up and running and put on that nice glass shift knob he
found in a box of parts in the bus. on the initial drive he felt a slight pinch/burn on the backside
of his hand which he had put down on the seat next to him and he jerked his hand away and couldnt
figure out why, you know, you blow those things off sometimes, first drive, your worried about
everything else.  then he left his bus parked out in the sun by itself and came back to find an
unpleasant suprise, in the form of a hole/burn in the middle of his newly upholstered vinyl seat!
The sun was being focused right in the middle of the seat by the glass knob, like a magnifying
glass!
 Not too happy to say the least. If you make these, a disclaimer would probably be a good idea.
