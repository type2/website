Subject: WolfsburgWired

How many of you subscribe to WolfsburgWired of Wolfsburg West (I really
don't need to know)? I find their Technical Tips to be excellent. Text and
pics for the beginner, what a concept. Oh yeah, and they are color pics.
This month is &quot;12 Volt Wiper Armature Installation&quot;.
How do their prices compare to other online VW stores?

&gt; well, the time has *really* come. i mean it this time. I've got to
&gt; sell my westy ASAP.
&gt;
&gt; here's a little info about it: bought it in Arizona in '99 and
&gt; brought it to Boston, MA. no winter driving [well, 3 times since '99,
&gt; all short trips on dry roads]. no rot, though there's a little rust
&gt; under the windshield. thoroughly water- and soundproofed on the
&gt; inside, insulation added throughout. nice custom cut mahogany
&gt; interior panels. nicely upholstered interior, and new carpet
&gt; throughout. poptop is from a 74-79 bus, and there's no cot up top.
&gt; however, there's room to build a fold out bed like in the later
&gt; models. has the sink/icebox combo, but it's not hooked up at the
&gt; moment - needs some faucet and drain parts. comes with a childs cot,
&gt; but is mising the jump seat, and the shelf that hangs from the
&gt; ceiling above the engine compartment. has a nice CD player installed
&gt; and good JBL speakers.
&gt;
&gt; before driving it home from AZ i put new tires and new front brake
&gt; rotors and pads in. these have about 10,000 miles on them.
&gt;
&gt; this bus is very reliable, engine has been well maintained and there
&gt; are no major problems with it that i know of. it was most recently
&gt; inspected in August, 2001, but could probably use a tune up. Comes
&gt; with two boxes full of goodies like new window rubber, assorted
&gt; engine bits and pieces, some tools, etc. [no, i dont' want to sell
&gt; these separately] Because it came from Arizona, the body is in
&gt; fantastic shape - it just needs a paint job to look really good.
&gt;
&gt; at this point, i just want to get back what i paid for it and put
&gt; into it: at least $4500. I'll sell it to the highest bidder above
&gt; $4500 in the next week or two. buses in this kind of condition just
&gt; don't show up in new england that frequently. at Transporterfest last
&gt; fall, the most common remark i heard was &quot;I can't believe it's all
&gt; metal!&quot;
&gt;
&gt; the bus is located near Logan Airport in South Boston. it's easy to
&gt; get to from all the major highways coming into the city, and i work
&gt; at home so i'm here pretty much all the time.
&gt;
