&gt; I also have the original vacuum advance dizzy, but to place to
&gt; hook up the vacuum to on the new Webers.
&gt;
&gt; Timing is dead on at 5 degrees ATDC.


Timing is dead on at 5 after????

THAT timing spec is for the dual vacuum advance original distributor!

There are NO 'factory' specs for a 009 in any type4 engine. That distributor
is wrong. It will not give you enough total advance.
