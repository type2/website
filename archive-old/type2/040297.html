Ron, you imply in your post that the starter is not directly attached to
the battery and it kicks the solenoid; actually it's the other way
around-the solenoid is the &quot;relay&quot; that gets the primary juice from the
start ignition (upper contact) and then it kicks, sending full battery
juice (lower contact) to the starter as well as connecting the flywheel
to the starter. If the solenoid is old and sticks when hot and/or the
current is weak due to aging connections, it does nothing when you turn
the key---and getting the Bosch relay will insure the solenoid gets a
full jolt right from the battery terminal.  I finally got the relay
after tiring of lying under the bus with a minimag light in my teeth and
my 6&quot;piece of house wiring with the alligator clip on the end (clip to
upper contact, touch battery cable)!
