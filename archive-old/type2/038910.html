&gt; Hey Folks, I've got the standard Holy Trinity of VDO gauges ( oil press, oil

&gt; have a cure? Kind of a PITA.

Are the guages vented properly?  sometimes humidity will build up behind
the glass and will cause fogging.  Some people try to combat this by
sealing things up, but this usually leads to more fogging.  You might want
to drill a small hole in the back of the guage to allow moisture to vent
properly.
