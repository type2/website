Subject: engine out-heads stuck?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

hey volks,
well this weekend i finally got around to dropping the
engine out of lizzy.   came out quickly and easily, no
problems.   once out i was taking it apart to see
whats up inside and the heads were basically stuck?  
ive never had this happen before, they usually slide
out with just a litlle force a light tapping.   with
repeated somewhat gentle tapping i was able to get the
drivers side head off and it looked fine, but the
passenger side is stuck tight.   the lower head bolt
towards the front of the van seems to be stuck and
won't let the head slide off.   im assuming i should
use a torch and try to heat it but ive never
encountered this?   any thoughts as to why or tricks
to get it off besides heat?   the reason for my
disassembly is a rod knock.
thanks everybody
