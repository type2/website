Subject: Bench seat was cut out. Need advice. 

Hey hey, one of the PO's of my 76' took out what I'm assuming to be a
bench seat, and cut into the metal seat frame a walkthrough area. S/He
then put in 2 bucket seats. The passenger side looks like it may be
origional, but the drivers side is deffenantly NOT from the bus. What
I'm wondering is, &quot;Is that metal support for the seats structural, or
can I just finish the job they started, and cut out the rest of the seat
support, and just weld up something different?&quot;. 

I have pictures at http://67.160.13.189 but I'm not sure I have the
permissions set right for everyone to see 'em. I just installed apache. 

Thanks in advance
Chris
