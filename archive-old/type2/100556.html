Subject: RE: [T2] Carburetor assembly adhesive?

Hi Roland.

&gt;&gt;what is the best way to secure the accelerator pump injector (the 
&gt;&gt;goose-neck brass tube)
into its hole in the pot metal of the carb body?


Have you considered 'metal tape'??

It has a million uses, and a small roll goes a long way.  Any hardware store 
can provide.

It is super sticky, and if you wrap a small strip around the neck of  the 
goose-neck brass tube, it might give you enough extra material so that it 
could be fitted snugly.  May not be the 'best way', though.

P. S.  In theory, metal tape has a million uses, but in actuality, it has 
only 2,324.6 uses.
