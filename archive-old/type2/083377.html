&gt; Went to lube the front beam and found the center pen fitting is broken off.
&gt; This is serious+ACE- don't want to make a mistake and have to pull the bushing
&gt; to replace it.  Any ideas on how to remove/replace a grease fitting that's
&gt; been broken.

Clean out the muck and you'll find a hex head on the base of the fitting.
use a socket to remove the fitting, take it down to the FLAPS, and buy a
fitting with the same threads.

Installation is the reverse of disassembly.
