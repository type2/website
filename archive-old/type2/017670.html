Subject: Looking for an 1800 engine for a '74 bus.
Message-ID: &lt;3713EA84.1140_at_pacbell_dot_net&gt;

Volksfolks,
  Does anyone have an 1800cc engine for a '74 bus (in California that's
twin carb with all the smog maze) that's in pretty good nick or even
brand new that they would like to sell?
I have a 1974 bus, the engine has just undergone an examination at
TASSI's in Colma CA (USA) and they've told me that the cams are going
flat, the cylinder heads are shot (?), and that the pistons are worn.
They haven't even opened the crankcase yet so I can only expect the
worst. The time appears to have come to get a new engine.
 Now I'm not afraid to do my own tune-ups and such, but I fear I'm being
forced into the heavy duty DIY situation by financial restraints (I am
not one of natures natural mechanics, alas) and I only have temporary
accomodation for the bus so a solution must be found within the next few
weeks.
 Hope you can help

Paul
