Subject: Re: [T2] remanned brake parts



&gt; Thanks for all the help everybody, but I still have
&gt; one question, that is: what about the pressed out
&gt; portion of the caliper piston?  No one addressed
&gt; whether its OK to have one side up and one side down. 
&gt; Everything I understand equals that both sides should
&gt; be down.  But again, everything I understand also says
&gt; that the pads should have a pressed out portion to
&gt; meet the piston.  What gives?

the cut-out part of the piston should be positioned the same on both sides (mirror images of each other.  the piston can be rotated to 
accomplish this.  the position of the piston is maintained by a thin metal plate between the piston and pad.  the plate has two small 
punched out tabs that keep the piston from turning.  See the Bentley for the correct piston position.
