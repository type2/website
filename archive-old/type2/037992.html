&gt; I dont think you could use a chassis punch to cut through the composite

hmmmm, mine is sharp enough to cut me, but I would put the cutter part
(and mine is designed that way) on the inside and pull through the steel
first then stop and cut the foam with a knife AFTER the metal hole is
pulled through... haven't tried it so YMMV
