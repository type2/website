Subject: Re: 76 Mileage

Ain:  The engine was rebuilt about 4,000 miles back (apparently 
this can affect mileage initially) and I've had some postings from 
other urbanites which indicate this figure is not uncommon, especially 
if one drives in 2nd and third gear a lot, which I do, in a lot of 
stop-go traffic and on hills. Either that or I've got an FI problem.  
Cheers, Art

&gt; &gt;Folks:  My '82 Vanagon gets _at_ 11.5 mpg in stop-and-go, urban (&amp; hilly)
&gt; &gt;driving.  I was aghast in the beginning but, as indicated by Mike, this
&gt; &gt;seems to be in the ballpark for the circa 2L engine under these
&gt; &gt;conditions.  Cheers, Art McGinn
&gt; 
&gt; Can that be true?  I don't have any first-hand experience with that model,
&gt; but that kind of fuel consumption seems excessive for ANY two-liter four-cyl.
