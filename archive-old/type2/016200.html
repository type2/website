Subject: Ignition Rotor Meltdown

Hey List,

I'm running a stock distributor and Pertronix ignition on my 1978 2.0L with
fuel injection.  I finished rebuilding the engine and have been driving it
regularly for about 3,500 miles.  This weekend it wouldn't start so I pulled
the distributor cap to find the rotor burnt to a crisp and the cap full of
welding slag.  I replaced the cap and rotor with new ones and drove about
150 miles home.  I checked it when I got home and it looked fine, but what
would have caused this?  Do I need a California emission/electronic ignition
cap and rotor with the Pertronix?  It already has a new Bosch blue coil.
The bus has been running great and timing is in spec.  Any help is greatly
appreciated. 

Thanks,

Randall and Kermit (The lean, mean, green machine)
