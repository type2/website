Subject: the tornado, does this thing work

Have any of you seen the infomercials for a product
called the tornado, its a metal piece you put in your
air filter to make the air free flow better. 
Supposedly it increases your horsepower by making the
air flow better thru the intake.  Anyone know anything
about it, opinions?
