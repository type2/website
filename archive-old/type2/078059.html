Subject: Re: [T2] Do you need separate oil temp and pressure sender?

I believe VDO sells a dual sender, but I cant swear to it. I think the
problem with that location was that it didnt get a true reading of temp. I'm
sure someone else can add to this.

Subject: [T2] Do you need separate oil temp and pressure sender?


&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I have a 71 Westy with Oil Pressure guage. There's a sender connected
right
&gt; at the stock oil pressure switch. Now I want to put in an oil temp guage
and
&gt; do I need to put in another oil pressure sender or is there one that does
&gt; both? What is the best way to connect, keeping the stock oil pressure
&gt; switch? Also, how difficult is it to install a head temp guage?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; William
