Hey all,
Well, on Monday I finally got the camshaft I had been waiting for from
Larry's Off Road.  The first camshaft I got from them as part of an engine
kit was too tight on the backlash, it would walk right out of the cam
bearings when the crank was rotated backwards.  So I sent that one back and
Larry's sent me another one.  I got it Monday and put it in, whaddya know,
no walkout.  But it is from the same manufacturer and was manufactured the
SAME DAY as the other.  Manufacturing tolerances, eh?

So with that and two new main bearings (long story) I put the bottom end
together and miraculously even got it right the first time :-)

I continued Monday into the evening until I had the entire long block
assembled, up to putting the valve covers on.

Tuesday I had my brother help me move it from the basement to the garage
before it got any heavier.

Once in the garage I decided to cheat on having to jack the car up 3 feet by
instead sliding the long block under the car and assembling it that way.
Amazingly enough, it worked :-)  I got most of the accessories on then, up
to the fan shroud, then I called it a night.

Now we have reached today.  Reading Wilson's book, Wilson says to install
the lower tin and the heat exchangers before putting the engine in.  I
decided to wait until the engine was in thinking it would be easier.  Well
it is possible to do these things with the engine in, but it is not nearly
as easy as when the engine is out.  Score one for Wilson.  At any rate,
today I got motivated and installed the engine by myself.  It wasn't too
bad, I inched each side upwards by using some homemade wooden ramps I had
until I had enough clearance under the center of the engine to put the
hydraulic jack in.  Since the car wasn't jacked up at all, I didn't have to
raise the engine very high to install it.

I finally got it to mesh on the second try.  On the first try I had the
thing a little slanted and the lower studs wouldn't line up with the holes
in the bellhousing.  Second time I got it right.

After I got it in I of course did all the connections and other stuff,
mounted exhaust, tin, etc.

Remembered to put oil in the crankcase before starting it (important!) and
also static-timed it to get a baseline setting.  While doing this I found
out I screwed something up with the distributor or distributor driveshaft
installation, because now when the distributor is oriented like it's
supposed to be on the engine, the notch in the rim is where #2 is when the
timing mark is lined up with the seam in the crankcase.  D'OH!  Well I just
switched around the plug wires and have not thought much about it.  Anyone
know what I did wrong?

Anyway, got all that done and checked out, then disabled the ignition and
cranked it until the oil pressure light went out and then some.  Was
surprised at how quickly it went out.  Then I enabled the ignition and after
some sputtering and coughing it fired up enough for me to go back and raise
the engine speed to 2000 rpm, where I left it for 20 minutes a la Wilson.
It ran nice, didn't seize, smoke, or make funny noises!  Yes! :-)

The money I spent on having the machinist balance the crank
pulley/crankshaft/flywheel/pressure plate assembly seems to have paid off as
it ran very smooth, almost vibration-free even later on when I knocked the
idle speed back down to normal.

I did that after 20 minutes, checked the timing with a timing light and it
was a little off, so I readjusted it.  Shut the engine off and re-adjusted
the carb as the previous settings were giving me too slow an idle.  And
that's where I stopped.

Tomorrow I change the oil and adjust the valves, maybe give it its first
drive if the weather is nice.

I'm very happy though I know I'm not out of the woods yet :-)

It's been about 3 months rebuilding this engine, most of it waiting for the
machinist and other schedule conflicts so I'm glad to finally have it done.

Sorry for the length, thanks for reading!!!
