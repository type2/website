Hello,
I'm considering making a trip down to the city to see a 73 westy in Queens.  I
am great at driving standard, but I still prefer automatic, and this camper
just happens to be so.  I know it will be really slow, but I don't care.  I
was just wondering if there was anything else about an automatic bus that
would turn me off of one.  Also I am looking to buy a VW camper that is not
too far of a drive away from upstate ny, and is in good condition and
drivable.
Thank you,
Shawn Smithson
