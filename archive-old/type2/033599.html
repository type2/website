Lisa,
Now that we kicked Dr. Tim around it's time for the list to get helpful.
It appears to this humble ape that your van is running too rich, but because 
you passed the HC tests with flying colors you have some room to lean the 
mixture so as to get the CO down to passing levels. The fact is that the two 
values, CO and HC, move inversely to each other as you adjuct the mixture. 
So my suggestion would be to turn the idle adjust screw on top the air flow 
meter box out (counter-clockwise) about one half a turn and recheck the 
values in an off line test mode, if that is offered in you community (i.e., 
not an official test for the record). See how that adjustment works. You are 
looking for the happy medium where although the HC is up, it still passes, 
and the CO drops below the limit. You can gauge how much to make a second 
adjustment, if necessary, based on the results of the off line test.
You may want to indeed add the &quot;pass or don't pay&quot; elixer, as my experience 
is that it does in fact reduce the CO value. Let us know of your success!
