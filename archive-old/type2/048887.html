That sounds like the a #3-4 exhaust manifold for a '79 california spec type
IV.  Are you sure that your engine is not a '79?  Do you have square
exhaust ports?

You might be able to have your cracked mainfold welded.  That is what I had
done to mine.  If it is a '79, it is stainless steel, so whoever welds it
must be able to weld stainless.  These manifolds often get cracked when the
bus gets rear ended enough to tweak the muffler/exhaust system.  I have
seen 2 successful weld jobs on these manifolds.
