&lt;&lt; Also anyone know of a good way to cob job the rust holes especailly the
 wheel wells and floor boards and runners, I have some sheet metal riveted
 down but need to plug up any leaks.  &gt;&gt;

My '77 Westy was in need of some patching up. So this is what I did:

1.	Had a garage repair (weld) the drivers side sill (aka rocker panel).

The cost was approx $200 and they really did a messy job. It took me another
two days of grinding and finishing to make it look decent. I suspect they
just slapped on some sheet metal with little preparation of the things
behind it. So I am not satisfied with solution #1.

2.	Patched up a couple of small holes with bondo etc.

That looked alright for a while but a year down the road and I am starting
to see rust again. So I'm not really satisfied with solution #2.

3.	Bough a very cheap welder and replaced the pass. side sill myself.

I had never welded before but given the facts above I just wanted to have a
go at it myself. This time I am satisfied. You can read the whole story on
my website (http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus/rocker.htm) I'm sure you can do
it too. Total cost (including welder!) approx $250. Bondo, roof tar and pop
rivets are a waste of time. As was written before the cancer will spread
(but out of sight).
