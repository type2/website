Subject: Jalousies in a Vanagon

Barry found a vanagon westy with jalousie windows.  I am curious, as
I did not think that such  a thing existed, but I have seen them now
and they are sure as all get out jalousies and fit the vanagon window
opening!  Has anyone else ever seen such a thing???

Hey there, 

There was an article in the LiMBO transporter newsletter about
retro-fitting the bay jalousie windows in a Vanagon. Maybe a PO
installed the jalouise windows ??

Recently from the LiMBO list:

Re: [limbolist] Installing 70's louvered window in '81 Vanagon???
This was in The TRANSPORTER - Vol. 12, #3, May-June 2000 issue.
Unfortunately, I only have two of the pages. I could scan them and
send them or maybe someone else has already done so. Or you could get
the back copies from LiMBO. And from the info I do have, it's much
easier in the pre '85 vans.
&lt;paste&gt;

I can scan the article (2 1/2 pages) too for anyone that's interested
in hosting 'em. It'll be too big for me to host (my website provider
will charge me for &quot;excessive&quot; bandwidth).

Later..
