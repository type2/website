Subject: Re: [T2] Totally Dead 1974 Deluxe Westfalia

&gt; The &quot;hot&quot; wire to the battery seems odd to me, as actually 3 wires
&gt; were sort of screwed together on top of the post, and one appears to
&gt; go to the other side of the engine compartment for the aux. battery,
&gt; but then is screwed to the side of the engine compartment along with
&gt; several other wires.  There is also a skinny red wire that was
&gt; attached to the post along with the thick black wire that seems to
&gt; come from the front of the vehicle.
&gt;

First thing I'd do is remove that second battery and any related
wiring and such. If you can take some pics we can help you determine
what's right and what's wrong.

That wire screwed to the side of the engine compartment is what has me baffled.

So get us those pics! And if you post a general location (Like mine's
the &quot;Denver area&quot;) maybe someone close by can help out.
