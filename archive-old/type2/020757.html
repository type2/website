The commercial mentioned is over a year old. The &quot;sports car&quot; isn't - it is
really a fuel-efficient gasoline electric hybrid vehicle  - the Honda Insight.
The original ad featured their introductory model year color which was a
shockingly bright, acidic, yellow-green; the current ad uses a model with a
metallic silver color. Last December, my wife and I purchased an Insight and
love it. No hype - on the highway, the car achieves &gt; 70 mpg and 50-60 in city
driving.

I think the comparison to activist oriented VW buses is apt - though, of course,
we're talking about two entirely different ranges of affordability (esp. when
one factors old v. new!).
