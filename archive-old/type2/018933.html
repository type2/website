I've got three Siemens SM-55 panels mounted on my roof.... each supplies 3.3 amps
under the best of conditions, somewhat less in others....

It allows me to run the fridge all day and keeps the batteries topped off so that
when the sun goes down, fridge still runs. I can make ice in my standard dometic
in my '78.

details are at:

Note that it's a little out-dated... will be re-doing these pages soon, as time
permits.

&gt; Has anyone tried putting solar cells on the roof? I wonder if enough amperage
&gt; can be drawn to keep systems going, as I recall the fridge draws about 8
&gt; amps.

&gt; &gt; . Has any one found a module cooling unit that could be mounted
&gt; &gt; in a Westy icebox? The result would be a dual source unit with 12v
&gt; &gt; supplying cooling while traveling and thereby extending the life of the
&gt; &gt; ice block and then while camping the ice block would continue to cool
&gt; &gt; while the engine is off. When in a campground hooked to 110v the adapter
&gt; &gt; that is sometimes supplied with the cooler would continue electrical
&gt; &gt; operation. There appears to be sufficient space at the rear of the
&gt; &gt; icebox for the module robbed from a cooler,fan,and necessary air flow.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
