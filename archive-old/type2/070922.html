Subject: Brake Questions, 71 westy
Message-ID: &lt;afec52ec.24591efa_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello, 
I've checked the archives and haven't gotten satisfaction. Perhaps someone 
can clue me in. 

Bus: 71 westy. totally stock motor.
Original problem:  Brake vacuum assist wasn't working. Van was stalling when 
brakes were applied. fluid was disappearing.

What I did: 
Renewed the vacuum line with the expensive vw stuff from manifold to servo.
renewed the servo vent line with cheap heater hose (for time being)
renewed the one-way air check. 

What happened:  nothing

disconnected the vacuum line from servo and plugged intake manifold port. 
This stopped it from stalling when I depressed the brakes. 

So then I decided the servo was faulty, and replaced it with a 73 servo that 
appeared to have much better suction than the old one. Old one was full of 
fluid.
didn't have the 'O' ring that bentley says is necessary, but once replaced, 
my servo was back and working fine. Brakes good.

Bled the back brakes, fluid was dark and oozing out, rather than clear and 
squirting out. never got to the squirting out point. Put about 400 miles on 
the van. During that time found the brake resevoir empty 3 times. refilled 
it. no leaks at the wheel or anywhere else. Finally noticed last night fluid 
dripping out of the replacement servo.

So my question: Can I assume this is a bad master cylinder, or does fluid 
disappear into the servo (I'm assuming that's where it went) if the 'O' ring 
isn't replaced or for other reasons, for instance could I have a major clog 
in the lines running to the back? Should I suspect the lines or master 
cylinder for this? By the way, no more stalling, van brakes well, but the 
fluid keeps disappearing.

Any advice or comments appreciated.
