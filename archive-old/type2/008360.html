I could not find it in the &quot;tunnel&quot; nor in the trunk.  Neither of the 
two have a plate on the dash(I don't know when that started).
Any other place where I may find it?

The 66 I am building has a plate in the trunk and the number in the 
&quot;tunnel&quot;. The one I bought for parts I can't find either.
Any and all help is greatly appreciated.

&gt;Jose;
&gt;   The VIN # for your 66 should be stamped on the tunnel under the rear 
seat
&gt;just behind the plate that covers the transmission linkage.
&gt;Hope this helps.

&gt;&gt; While on this topic... Just the other day I bought a 66 type 1 for
&gt;&gt; $400.00.  The guy had a title... but I could not find numbers in the
&gt;&gt; trunk or on the chassie.  I bought it cause I had another 66 which
&gt;&gt; needed a few small parts and the engine.
&gt;&gt; Well my question is: is there another place I may find the VIN #?
&gt;&gt; It would be a shame considering the body is solid.  The floor needs
&gt;&gt; changed, work.Any help is gretly appreciated.Thank You, Joe
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Every state (and presumably country) has procedures in place to 
clear
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;the title for a vehicle that you possess legally.  There is no 
reason
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;that I can think of to swap VIN plates unless the ownership of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;vehicle is questionable.&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The only reason I can think of is if the vehicle you posess is not
&gt;&gt; &gt;legal to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;drive in the US, like say a Mexican beetle or a Brazilian type 
II.&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;With the theft problem that we have, should we condone a practice 
that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;is likely to result in more buses being stolen?&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I'm not saying I think it's ethical to sell VIN plates, but I think
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;chances of a bus being stolen and having different VIN plates 
swapped
&gt;&gt; &gt;in is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;pretty remote.  Think about it - if the bus is nice enough to 
steal,
&gt;&gt; it &gt;is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;probably well known in the VW community already.  I don't see it
&gt;&gt; &gt;happening
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;very often.
