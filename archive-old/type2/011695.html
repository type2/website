Subject: engine out-head off-new ?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

hey volks,
well i went out to the garage after work and with out
much effort the passenger side head came off.   guess
its time had come.   anyways, it was easy enough to
find my problem, # 4 rod has SERIOUS play in it so
that was the culprit as all others are nice and tight.
  what doesnt look good though is my pistons, which
are new mind you, less about 5000 miles, they dont
look right.  on #1,2 and 3 they all seem to have small
areas that are just a touch rough.  not so much rough,
just not a smooth as the rest of the piston.   this is
above the rings just before the top of the piston.  
the sleeves look fine with just a slight carbon ring
at the top.   so almighty list, did i kill a nice new
set of pistons?   the bus wasnt using any oil or
smoking at all before tear down, just knockin. feel
free to enlighten me, its only money after all, right?
  
meanwhile ill be tearing it down and saving my
pennies.
thanks
