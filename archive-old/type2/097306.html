Subject: Help Please-Rear End Noise!

Hi all:

I've just finished doing a complete rear end brake job on my '82 Westfalia,
and now I've got a problem I'd sure appreciate some help on.

Background:

'82 is new to me; purchased 3-4 weeks ago.  Drove it once or twice a week
since then and noticed no noise, no problems.  Just finished installing new
rear brakes - shoes, drums, hardware, wheel cylinders - and now I have a
definite &quot;clunk&quot; in the left rear, one clunk per wheel rotation.  I'm also
feeling it through the brake pedal when I apply the brakes.  It seems like
the noise and the brake job go hand-in-hand but I've done rear brakes on my
'81 before with no problem and I've pulled the left drum on the '82 now a
half a dozen times and would swear everything is correct: E-brake attached,
front shoe in front, rear shoe in rear, 4 springs in place.  The noise is
consistent on straight runs and left turns (haven't turned right yet).

At first I thought maybe by pure coincidence a CV joint had gone bad while
the car was sitting there, but I've had an outboard CV joint go bad before
and I don't remember feeling it through the brake pedal in this fashion.

I also thought about the wheel bearing, but I've read that bad bearing tend
to make more of a rumbling sound while this is a definite &quot;clunk.&quot;

Can anybody think of anything wrong in the brake job that could be causing
this?  Something installed wrong, defective drum, anything?  I figure an
out-of-round drum could give me the brake pedal &quot;pulse&quot; but I sure wouldn't
expect any sort of &quot;clunk.&quot;

TIA.
