Subject: a place to send cylinder head cores?

Hi all,

I got back to the machine shop and they did a great job on everything.
The heads though were cracked at every single seat. I need to get some
new ones and I was wondering if there was a place to send cores so that
they may one day be turned into something useful.

They are Type 1 dual port heads

Thanks,

Max Bronsema
