Subject: new van

Well I have a new van.. however I got the price down somewhat since
it's having problems getting into 3rd. I have it scheduled to go in for auto
tranny work.

Compression check was ok. 120 120 115 125
vacumn levels at 15 or a little more
seems to be a decent little van other than the tranny.
