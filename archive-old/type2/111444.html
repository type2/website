Subject: RE: [T2] Legal assistance in Cincinnati

&gt; Hello volks-
&gt; Had a bad time with a PO who rated the 78 Westy we bought as a #2 (needing
&gt; no mechanical work) on SAMBA. Our baby ended up needing over $3,000 worth of
&gt; work...

&gt; the guy is an Associate minister.

I that case, show up at his church on Sunday and ask him, in front of the
congregation, about what part of &quot;bearing false witness&quot; he is having
problems comprehending.

Just a thought...

George
