 There is a procedure in the archives for replacing bay rear brakes with
 Vanagon rear self-adjusting brakes:

And here in Fresno Calif, both Pick a Part and Pick n Pull are doing a 50% off sale
on New Years weekend......  this is the perfect time to get those Vanagon rear brakes.....
Looking at the www.picknpull_dot_com website, they have them in 6 states as far east as Illinois
and Indiana and 2 in Canada. Looks like San Antonio,TX is the only one not doing the sale.....

Not sure what happened to the Pick a Part website. There was 2 of them. One for Pick a Part,
which is what it is called here; and Pick your Part, which is what it is called down in southern Calif.
The 2 brothers split the names......  The southern Calif website was www.pickyourpart_dot_us but
seems to have vaporized. When you type in http://www.pickapart_dot_com/ it brings up the Pick Your
Part yards in southern Calif...... very strange.

Not sure if the Ecology yards in southern Calif is doing the 50% sale. Did not see it listed on their
website:   http://www.ecoparts_dot_com/locations.htm

I always enjoyed walking around the U-Pull Parts-U-Pick Parts in Sun Valley, along I-5. The place has a wall
around it and they have vehicles up on top. Almost all appear to be movie prop cars and trucks from every
movie made, i.e. the Mad Max 2nd movie etc. They are the only self-serve yard
that has not punctured gas tanks yet..... but maybe they have started this year. Last I was there was
last summer.
