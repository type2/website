Tracked down original 9mm/8mm exhaust studs today and tried the local bug
shop's suggestion of red locktite and let it sit overnight to setup
suggestion. As I guessed, the three missing stud holes are stripped and will
not begin to hold the studs.

I guess my next step is remove the just-installed muffler and the heat
exchangers and try to find a 9mm heli-coil kit. I think I can fix it then.
Never done a heli-coil. 
Any suggestions for things to do and not to do? Or should I do some other
magical thing other than drop the engine?
