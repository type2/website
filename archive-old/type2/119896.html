Subject: used parts

&quot;&quot;I have vent windows in both the driver's rear window
sections which are very rusted at the bottom.  I need
the frame to bus and the frame to glass, are these
only available used?  Any suggestions on where to find
them?&quot;&quot;
Here are some sources you can check out

Rudi Schaffner has a large cache of parts. Very well
organized.. give him a call or shoot him an e-mail.

--Likewise for Ken .. they both will ship and these
parts arent so big as to be killer on shipping.

---Then of course you can dig through the Samba site.
