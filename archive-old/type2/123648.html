Subject: vacuum advance:  theory

I'm trying to understand the functions of mechanical and vacuum advance.

The need for advance at high rpm makes sense to me.  The &quot;burn&quot; needs 
time to travel from plug to piston.

I understand how mechanical advance satisfies this need at high rpm.

I hear that vacuum advance exists to give a healthy slug of advance 
at low rpm when mechanical advance is minimal.

  What I don't get is why lots of advance is needed at low rpm and a 
just-off-idle throttle position.  Since rpm are low, there can be no 
need to compensate for burn travel time.

Can a guru step in and offer an explanation?

Thanks, jack
