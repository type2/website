Subject: Wood panel restoration (sliding door)

What luck.  I recently came across an almost intact sliding door panel
for my '71.  Only a small section is warped/chippy and it's otherwise in
great shape.  Here's my idea for fixing the damage and ensuring that the
panel will stay healthy.  glue &amp; clamps
 Has anyone reglued the veneer back together with the help of clamps?
What might be the  best glue for this project?  When completed, I am going
to try some type of sealant (Waterseal?) on both sides of the panel.
Whatcha think?

p.s.) I also scavenged an odd child's cot.  The metal bars aren't tubular
like the other child cots I have seen. They are long U-Shaped bars. Any
know-it-all have details on this?  I got 'em out of a junked mid-70's
Westy.  It's got a pretty salvagable interior if anybody wants me to get
anything...
