Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable installation successful

Too late now, but next time consider replacing the Bowden tube as well.
They're not expensive.  A new tube and well lubricated cable will greatly
improve clutch action and control.

It's also important to have just the right amount of bend in the Bowden
tube.  I don't have the VW manual at hand, but there's a specific curve that
must be established, using shims if necessary.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  The toughest part was working it through the bowden tube. I eventually
unbolted it from the tranny and worked it on through.  I found that turning
the tube really made the threaded end go through better.

I adjusted so that I have 1/2 inch play at the top, tightened everything and
checked it twice, and took her for a test drive.  &lt;&lt;
