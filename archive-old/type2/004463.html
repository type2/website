Subject: lurking for a week, Bought I high top Safare
Date: Thu, 25 Jan 2001 10:10:47 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I just recently added to my collection of cars with a 1970 safare high-top
camper.  I would have no Idea what it was except someone on the list just
gave a link for the type2 site with them.

I was wondering what they are worth, how many were produced, what were some
of the factory options for them, etc.  I have the top that drops down in the
back for the roof rack.  Any information that you guys have, I would be
greatful to recieve....

I'll lend the list the story of the purchase at a later date.
