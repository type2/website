Subject: Best air tools

Brett,
        I think impact wrench is first and foremost!  The ratchet is a good
second bet.  Another nice piece is the air hammer or chisel, it certainly
isn't for fine adjustments but if you need to get something off or apart
that is or can be trashed anyway (say: rusty bolt) it is nice.  beyond that
look at what you are going to be doing.
