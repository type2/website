Subject: Re: Copy of: Hot VW's &quot;Type2 the series&quot;- what happened?

On 22 Sep 96, &quot;Turner,Ronald L.&quot; &lt;102660.66_at_CompuServe.COM&gt; wrote:
&gt;started by going over a year of the type2 each month, starting with the early
&gt;'50 model type2's. Each month there was a description of that particular year
&gt;bus and all body / mechanical changes from the previous year.  Charlie Hamill
&gt;oversaw the splittie years, and every detail from year to year was scrutinized,
&gt;never missing an issue. The series was supposed to continue to the '79 model,
&gt;but I detected a loss of interest on the writer's part (Bruce) in the last
&gt;bug-engined bus, '71 model.  A '72 description did follow, but '73's - 2 months
&gt;overdue and riddled with incorrect information, was the last one ever written.

I phoned the associate publisher/editor, Bruce Simurda, and asked him
about the future of this series of articles.  He said that they have
gone bi-monthly with this series.  When I mentioned that it has not
appeared in the Oct issue he checked to see if it's scheduled for the
Nov issue.  It's not currently scheduled for that issue.  Bruce said
that he would check with the author.

Bruce also told me that there would probably be one final article that
includes all the rest of the '70s bus models.  He said that there was
not that many changes during those years.  I let him know that there are
some folks that are interested in seeing the series done in a year-by-year
article and that there were many changes to the Type2 in the '70s.

BTW, the offices for the magazine are just around the corner from my work.
