TBear: I was very fortunate to acquire a 68 Kombiwagen two years ago which 
had received loving care from dockside to sale in 95 by orig owner and second 
owner didn't have it long enough to damage it. I had to replace two side 
panels, the rear cargo door panel and the slider panel where water damage had 
caused stains and minor delamination. All the rest of the birch interior was 
in pristine cond. I was able to obtain 1/8&quot; birch plywood from my local 
builders supply. Grain and wood color were a good match to orig. I used 
Varithane satin, two coats and was very pleased with the over all match. Good 
luck. Ray.  68 Kombiwagen, 69 Transporter
