&gt;The best way I can think of to fix it would be to drill out the holes to 3/8
&gt;and pop in some of those rivet nutsert jobbies, size M6.  Only trouble is, I
&gt;don't have the tool and they're not all that cheap.  One day...

Dave, 

I installed some of these using a M6 bolt through them with a 
normal nut and washer and tighten it gently, it pulls the rivet 
nut into shape and you won't have to buy the tool for once or twice 
kinda use.

Hope it helps, 

Brian
