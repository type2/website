&gt; Someone can correct me but haven't VW's always had steel inserts
&gt; in the aluminum heads? My understanding of engines that 'need' lead
&gt; is that it prolongs the life of straight cast-iron valve seats in
&gt; low-tech engines. Other than that, lead is a problem, not a benefit,
&gt; for engines. With GM and DuPont making a few cents FOR EVERY GALLON
&gt; of leaded gas, you can expect that a lot of BAD information about
&gt; the desirable qualities of lead was put out between the 1920s and 1970s.

They have, but it wasn't the right kind of steel to run lead-free until,
IIRC, 1966 or 1967. (One of those two years...)

All dual-port VW heads, whether Type 1 or Type 4, will have the proper seats
for lead-free operation. I don't know if VW could see into the future to
envision an unleaded world (if they could have seen *that* far into the
future, we wouldn't need to run premium in these little cars now!) or if it
was just for overall longevity, and I don't care either.

BTW, &quot;low-tech&quot; engine? You mean like the kind we have in our cars?
