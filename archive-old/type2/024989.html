    I take exception to 2 points. I've always used Bosch points too, but I 
think I've read of 3 or 4 having lost the rubbing block in just the last 
couple of days and I myself found myself walking due to the same thing.
    I'll catch hell for it, but I dont think the stock bus jack is that bad, 
it goes in a slot it can't come loose from and lifts high enough to actually 
be useful.
