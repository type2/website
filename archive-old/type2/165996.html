Well, it's running a bit rich, but you have quite a bit of leeway on the 
NO side so you might want to lean it out a few clicks in the AFM 
(tighten the spring).  The EGR will also help keep the NO down as you 
lean it out as leaning the mixture raises NO levels.

Now, I am guessing that the AFM works the same way as on my 78.... I'm 
sure someone else can confirm.
