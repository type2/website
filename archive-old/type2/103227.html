&gt;
&gt; This piece of information is being offered just as a place to start.  As has
&gt; been mentioned a 185R14 (if radial) was the original equipment on your bus.
&gt; The originals may have been bias ply tires also, but that's another story.

There's a little book that VW mechanics used to get called Without Guesswork. This book, circa 1970, says that
starting in 1968 model year the deluxe vans got 185R14 radials. Meanwhile the work trucks still used 7.00-14 bias
ply tires. In researching my tire purchase I discovered that the diameter of that bias tire is about 26.1 inches
which makes a difference in the accuracy of your speedometer and in the RPMs your engine is running at.  Having
run Busses with the smaller radials in the past I was dissatisfied with the extra stress that put on my engine
while at highway speeds.  The larger tires I chose to match the 26.1 diameter are Firestone Wilderness HT 205/75
14 with a load capacity of 1532 (per tire). I find my Adventurewagen to be more stable in winds, it handles
curves extremely well, and I can go 65 without winding out the RPMS. The only downside is that due to the
slightly wider width it is a little harder to manuever in tight quarters.
