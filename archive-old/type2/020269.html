Subject: more problems with dansk parts

Ok this is me griping a bit.  I recently installed one of the busdepots
nos german heat exchanger (fantastic part, more on that later) I used
new dansk autopart barrel nuts for attaching the heater cables to the
flapper boxes.  of the two i had one had a hole too small for the cable
end to go through and wasn't threaded inside enough to allow the screw
to clamp down on the cable anyway and thus will forever sit in my tool
box. the other was large enough to accept a cable end and the thread
went down to the hole for the cable but just barely.  So i cranked that
screw down as tight as i could and it seemed to work. so i take my bus
for a spin first time with heat. it was 20 degrees outside.  with only
the one new german exchanger connected i was plenty warm wearing only a
fleece pullover (my oil temp was 180 degrees exactly) ,&quot; wow &quot; i'm
thinking I can't wait to see what its like with both exchangers hooked
up!&quot;  even with the one inch gap between the bottom of the sliding door
and the frame! (that's another bit of body work for me) . all of a
sudden it got cold, very cold, i could see my breath and a haze was
forming on the windshield. the crappy barrel nut came off the cable.  I
guess the thread was not down enough to hold the cable.  well i had a 20
minute drive with the thermometer in my bus reading 17 degrees! frozen
toes and fingers and a runny nose to boot i returned home. those barrel
nuts were plain defective, one so much so that i couldn't even try to
use it, the other just enough that i knew it wasn't right but tried it
anyway. i'll be heading to the local hardware store to find an
acceptable alternative.
thanks for your patience in reading my whining
jamie
