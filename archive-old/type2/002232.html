Well I have finally done it.
While turning right ,my front mounted tire went straight!
Im grateful that it missed everyone and everything but it was quite a sight.
I now have 7 small nubs of tubing coming out of the front of the bus.I have
looked through the archives and see no direct answers.
Before I get in over my head,where do the back side of the rods attach and
how do I get  them in/out.
Thanks for any info
