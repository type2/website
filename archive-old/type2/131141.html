Subject: re: [T2] Scrapping 1973 Auto 1700 Westphalia

Hey Chris - If you could contact me - I'd be interested in some parts from 
your bus.....

Thanks,

Jeff

&gt;End of an era: I'm scrapping my 1973 Automatic 1700 Westphalia Camper.
&gt;It seems a shame to send her to the scrappy, but I've too little time,
&gt;and her bodywork was beyond rescue if I'm honest.  I'll be pulling the
&gt;engine for a future project, but the rest is up for grabs if anyone is
&gt;in need of any parts.  She's got good glass and seals all round,
&gt;there's a 3/4 rock and roll bed, most of a very dated and used
&gt;interior, and of course the automatic transmission was a little leaky,
&gt;but otherwise healthy.  If anyone's in need of some spares, drop me an
&gt;email.  I plan to tow her to the scrap yard next weekend, sans engine.

&gt;Chris (York, UK.)
