Subject: RE: Getting Hot While Sitting

Water-cooled engines do the same. When I stop for gas in my company car ( Dodge Dakota) on a hot summer day, when I restart the engine, temp gauge swings way high, then immediately starts falling back to normal. Makes sense, because water has stopped flowing,and is now sitting in the engine block taking in the heat from the engine. When it starts to flow again, it cools down. Jeff
