Subject: Re: [T2] A vacuum guage for a bus owner, please read

Volks,

I disagree!!!  Entirely!!!  (OK, I just hadda say that :-)  Actually, I've
been pushing vacuum gauges as useful diagnostic tools for ages on the
list, but getting anyone interested has been difficult.  Two hours at
Everybus interested more people than 7 years of preaching on the list ever
did.  I guess it is the sort of thing that you have to see in action to
appreciate.

The gauge that David found is an excellent one.  Especially if you run
carbs.  The limit is that the fuel pressure end of it is *only* useful for
carbs.  You *cannot* use it for FI, that requires a separate (and more
expensive) gauge.  Another limit that I only discovered at Everybus is
that there is *nowhere* on a 1500 SP manifold to measure manifold
vacuum!!!  I am both shocked and appalled by this, as I consider manifold
vacuum to be a basic diagnostic.  I want to see some more carbureted SP
engines, but if this is truly the case, I am going to have to modify the
engine in the '67 somehow, as I will not run an engine I can't check
vacuum on.

&gt; Hello List,
&gt;
&gt; Well I waited until it was Friday before I posted this
&gt; message. I must say that one of my favorite moments at
&gt; Everybus was following Steve Dolan around, watching
&gt; and learning as he fixed several people's busses. I
&gt; found it amazing how much information that Steve was
&gt; able to obtain from a dwell meter, timing light, and a
&gt; vacuum guage. I wanted to tell everyone that I found a
&gt; vacuum guage in the tool section of Sears_dot_com. This
&gt; guage not only measures manifold vacuum, but it also
&gt; measures fuel pressure. This would be the perfect tool
&gt; for a bus owner. Not only can you make sure that the
&gt; vacuum is correct on your bus but you can also check
&gt; your fuel pump, and fuel flow through your fuel lines!

&gt;
&gt; It only costs $19.00. I would say this would be a very
&gt; good investiment. Any way, I just thought I would pass
&gt; it along.
&gt;
&gt; Have a nice day!
