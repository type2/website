Subject: Re: [T2] Broken thermostat wire

Yes you are.  Since you say most of your driving is in short jaunts.that is 
exactly the kinds of conditions the thermostat is for.  Here is a test:

Take off your oil filler cap and look at the whitish/chocolate colored goo 
on the inside of it.  That is what is on the bottom of your engine case, 
too..........sludge.  The motor never gets hot enough to burn the 
condensation out of it, and it becomes this.....
