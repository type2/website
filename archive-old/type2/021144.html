I'm finally getting around to checking out all the miscellaneous stuff
that came with Wunder - I was shocked to find the little &quot;swampy
icester&quot; ac unit goes for $347 from swampy...  I think the fluffy po
(who also painted acrylic geramiums/pots on the front doors and
cabinets, ech) actually bought this thing...  And this bus has factory
air...  No good of course when sitting still...

It works by using a 360 gph sump pump in an ice chest with water, pumps
the chilled water thru an exchanger, air sucked in from the back flows
thru that and out the adjustable vents on the top.

Some of you wealthy purists in hot humid climes may actually think it's
worth that...  ;-)  I never would dropped that kinda money on one, but
I'm gonna hold on to this one for that one night when I just can't take
it any more.  LOL.
