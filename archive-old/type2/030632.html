Subject: Removing interior roof trim
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSI.4.00.9906110914450.9372-100000_at_hometown.idirect_dot_com&gt;

Does anyone have experience removing the wooden interior roof trim above 
the driver's seat in a 1970 Westy?  The Bentley book does not take the
vent pipe for the sink into account.  Is there a way to temporarily remove 
this pipe to replace the plywood liner?

Thanks,
Gord
