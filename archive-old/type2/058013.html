There 
&gt; is absolutely no advantage/need to use 12 gauge for this application.

One disadvantage to using larger wire in this application is that the
larger wire will put increased stress on any terminals to which it is
attached.  This can cause mechanical failure of the terminals.  As our
buses get older, the plastic becomes more fragile, so you really don't
want to push its strength!
