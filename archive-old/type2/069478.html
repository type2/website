Subject: Can you help this guy.

All,

I know this is not VW related, but he is interested in restoring a very old
vehicle.  I know some of you are into other vehicles besides VW's, so you
may have some information that can help him.

Hello fellow Mechanics!

I started a new project this weekend!  I found the body (no chassis,
engine, seats etc.) to a 1940 Ford Coupe sitting in a field housing
a family of rabbits. The owner sold me the can for TEN BUCKS!!!!
WHAT A DEAL!   Now I am interested in restoring it to it's original
look.  My question:  Does anybody have a contact of a supplier or
shop that may have an old Chiltons type manual for a '40 Ford Coupe?
I'd like to get the specs on what I am going to need to get her
running again.

Thanks in advance for the help!
                                -Tony
