&gt; If your bus has a type 4 engine

Thanks, everyone for your comments.

Yes, it is a type 4 and there is one that runs into a valve stem seat and one 
that runs into a valve seat, but they are very, very fine. The bigger ones 
are about 1/2&quot; away from the seats. I don't have the cash right now for new 
heads, so I guess I'll just leave them as they are, and keep an ear open for 
any changes in the sound of the engine.
