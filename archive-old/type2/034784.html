Hello,

the 46 mm axle nut started in early 64 on all busses... it may have been
an option in 63 but i dont think so.

Composite drums were introduced with the advent of disc brakes in 1971 as
standard.  I believe they were optional prior to that for a couple of
years, but have no idea how they were set up.

peas,

Steve
