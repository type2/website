&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
&gt; got towed into Charlottesville a few days ago.  Broken clutch operating cross shaft.  I have a place to stay, but the engine is out and can't move until I find another cross shaft.
&gt; 
&gt; Any leads on where I could find a cross shaft for a 68-70 bus.  Willing to buy a transmission if the price is right.  Can get a ride within a few hours of Charlottesville.
&gt; Any suggestions would be appreciated!!!

If the fork is broken from the shaft, you can simply weld it back on.
Find a welding or muffler shop and they can do the job.  While they're at
it, have them weld the other fork securely to the shaft as well.

If the tips of the fork are broken you can get a piece of metal, file it
to shape, and have the welder replace the tip of the fork with your new
metal.

This might be quicker than getting a new cross-shaft, though with the 
magic of Fed-Ex you might be able to get a new shaft faster.  If you can,
get an aftermarket shaft made for dune buggies.  They are much stronger
than stock shafts.

In any case, get a new throwout bearing if you have an old-style
transmission with the ring on the leaf springs.  The old-style throwout
bearings don't like being tossed around on the shaft if you drive the
vehicle with the bearing loose from the fork.  The new style bearings sit
on the sleeve and save themselves.
