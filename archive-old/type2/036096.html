I think that you have to take the nut off of the other end, don't you?

&gt; So here we are 2 somewhat knowledgeable
&gt; VW enthusists trying for 3 hours to get the old starter out. Got the bottom
&gt; bolt out no problem but the top bolt has a small phlange surrounding the
&gt; bolt head so we could only get a small bit of the wrench around it...
