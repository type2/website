Subject: misc rambling

&quot;&quot;If putting food on the table is an important issue--
maybe VW's shoudn't be part of your life right
now--they are like paying rent or feeding the
family--they require the bucks on a regular basis--no
way around it--it's an understood thing.&quot;&quot;

Huh,, what?  A paint job isnt exactly maint. A bus
is cheaper to buy parts for and work on than any new
car that I know of..... so if putting food on the
table is a issue then a bus is a good choice IMHO.

---women and buses.... I know half a dozen ladies
that can not only take care of said bus... but
put more miles on thier transporter than most people.
Blanket statements... tsk tsk!
