Subject: Re: [T2] Air-fuel gauge results

Mark,

I would like to do this as I will need it when I get ready to install
they diy fi systems(Megasquirt).  I have a 78 stock fed model.

What part number/price for the sensor?

I appear to have a plug on the drivers side curved exhaust pipe...is this 
where you mounted yours?

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I gave up and bought myself an LED gauge (Autometer) to connect to the Oxygen sensor that I added to my '78 for tuning. It actually looks like my voltmeter was giving me the correct readings after all, but the gauge does make it much easier to see the swings in  mixture.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm curious to hear from other listees (78 or before) who are using an oxygen sensor and an air/fuel mixture gauge. I'd especially like to know whether during light acceleration/cruise whether a (very) lean condition is normal. I have my AFM tuned to be a little on the rich side most of the time, but under certain conditions light throttle/cruise the gauge displays lean. I don't know whether this is normal, a problem, or an exhaust leak that I haven't found yet. I'm swapping in another AFM soon to see if it behaves different, but your experiences would be useful to know.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!!
