Subject: Endplay in new and worn engines-crank &quot;windup&quot;?

quoth Vanagon Man:
  Check endplay before you do
anything during the teardown...........that would give you a fairly good
indicator of what your main bearings are all about.

Re end play, when I did the clutch replacement on my high milage engine
(220,000 at the time, no rebuild, now 236,000 but oil pressure can be 18
when hot (230deg) at 55 mph- goes higher with rpm increase.  Idle
pressure is still good (about 5, can make higher set VDO gauge flicker
when oil is 240).   I found the endplay to be at the upper limit (can't
recall now, about .008?) I put in the right combination of shims, but
the end play went to zip when the engine was wound up in the rotation
direction, so I put in narrower shims to get me to a wound up
measurement around .004.  So how does the rotation position affect the
endplay in a 1. new engine, and 2. old engine?  I did see movement (in
out) in the thrust bearing and thought this was related.
