&gt; I guess every AAA &quot;chapter&quot; is different. AAA Potomac ( Mid Atlantic region)
&gt; said I had to be a member for 3 yrs before &quot;qualifying&quot; for the Plus.

	Current policy dictates that you must be a regular member of AAA
Potomac for one year, with no more than 2 road service calls during that
year, in order to qualify for AAA Plus.

  ...ran out of gas at a toll booth. Tow
&gt; truck with AAA goes by ( not towing a car) I yell to the guy &quot;Hey, I'm a AAA
&gt; member and I need gas&quot; The SOB yelled back, &quot;Call it in&quot; and took off.

	I assure you that if he did not have a call pending, he would have
stopped unless someone happened to cop an attitude with him. It is not
unheard of for a wrecker service to be busy all day long... calls backed
up across the ticket board at the dispatch office. When things are busy,
one must hustle in order to make decent money as well as take care of
the customers. Calls from law enforcement agencies also take priority
over all other business. These conditions exclude activities like
explaining the above to stranded travelers who miss the big picture and
see only an empty tow truck driving away from them. If I have to, I'll
sit in my bus and wait my turn like everyone else does. And, I'll like
it ;)
