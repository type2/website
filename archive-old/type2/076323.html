Subject: reversed polarity checker

Almost any hardware store sells a tester for about $10
that you can plug into a wall outlet to check for
faults and or reversed polarity. Easy to use, has
three (as I remember) lights that are indicators for
the different faults common to house (AC) wiring.
----
I have seen too many campsites that have the
receptacles wired backwards,, or
the camper is wired incorrectly,
