Subject: Re: [T2] Can someone tell me what these are?

Stephen,

That is where the engine bearer bar (aka mustache bar) attaches to the
body of the bus (via rubber mounts).  They should be present on any
'68-'71 bus, and they are welded on.  They were probably removed by
someone intending to install a type IV (or some non-vw) engine.  Or
perhaps they were rusty, and the PO was going to replace them?

You need to find your self an early bay ('68-'71) donor bus.  Someone
on the list might have one and be willing to cut them for you.  If
not, give Ken Madson _at_ thebusco_dot_com a shout... he probably has some.
Good luck.

&gt; Can someone tell me what these circled parts are in this picture
&gt; http://www.geocities_dot_com/spschmidt/images/question.jpg?  Are they welded
&gt; in or bolted in?  Should my 69 have them?  If so any suggestions on how
&gt; to get some?  The PO seems to have removed them when they put in a later
&gt; engine.
