Brad,

remove the rubber stop (best done before you even jack up the bus). Unscrew the hex screw and nut holding the torsion arm in place. Jack up the other side (remove the rubber stop first). Your upper torsion arms should now rest on the beam extension that holds the stop. Get the biggest pry bar and hammer you can find and work it slowly off.

Jacking up the other side of the car takes off some spring action but not all. For reinstall mount all 4 torsion arms on the unloaded springs and then start working to upper ones back into place.

'79 Westy with brand new balljoints (still waiting for alignment)


Hi all,
  I have a '79 bus and I am replacing my ball joints and torsion arms...well
trying I have the front end on jack stands and removed the driver sides
lower arm, but for the life of me I can get the top arm off..it is resting
on the upper torsion stop and it is under lots of spring action. What do I
need to do to be able to remove the upper arm. The lower arm slid right off.
Please help. BTW I have done nothing to the passanger side.
