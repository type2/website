Subject: Re: [T2] chicago bus owners

When I lived in a southern suburb of Chicago, I knew of a place in Chicago
Heights called The People's Garage.  It was run by an old guy named Hans.
Anyone know if that place is still there?

Also in the heights is a place called Oliver's Imports, on Western.  The
Pastor of my church took his Honda there, said he was a straight shooter and
worked on everything foreign.

Mike
