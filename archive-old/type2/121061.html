Subject: gap in exhaust joints

I am putting my exhaust back together on my rebuild and there are small 
gaps (~1mm) between the exhaust joints.  It seems like the flanges with 
the bolt holes have bowed in towards each other leaving gaps in between 
each flange.

Does anyone have a descent solution to fix this?  I'm thinking I can use 
multiple gaskets so that it will compress where the bolts are but not 
where the gap is.  Or, I was also debating trying to grind the exhaust 
flanges flat on the sander.

any thoughts?

thanks,
Mike
