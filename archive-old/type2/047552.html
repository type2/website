Jon, 

I can scan it for you...  Look in your mailbox in about thirty
minutes.  FWIW, I'll also cc Thom to get it on the vintagebus site.

&gt; 
&gt; We're getting ready to replace the main harness in our 68. We have the
&gt; Bentley with a b/w diagram, does anyone have (or know of a place online) a
&gt; copy of the color diagram? The archives directed us to the Vintage Bus
&gt; wiring diagram page, but of course, they don't have one for the 68 model.
&gt; TIA
