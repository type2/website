&gt;Can I just tighten this up and forget about it or should I be digging
deeper? Why does it need to be so tight, anyway? Should I be paying homage
to some greater power that I found this before it found me?
 I think this probably accounts for the &quot;wierd scraping sound on right hand
bends&quot;. 
 Can anyone offer any suggestions as to what the &quot;peculiar humming noise&quot;
might be? This one is roadspeed related and sounds a little like an
off-road tyre drumming on pavement. Not very loud (below ~20mph it's
inaudible and over 45 or so the wind noise swa!
m&lt;

Will,
        The last thing I would want to do is make a recommendation to
someone that would result in reducing the level of attention to a problem,
but I personally have experienced both of these symptoms at the same time. 
Again, front wheels are another story and if you think noises are coming
from the front by all means check it out!

        The scraping is coming from the rear axle nut being loose.  What
you are displacing when you tighten this nut down is beyond my level of
technical expertise, but my '69 does this about once every year and a half.
 The last time I experienced this was following a long hard road trip thru
very winding, twisty mountain roads.  Frequently, my tires would squeal at
the sharpness and high speed associated with a surprise tight turn.  The
sound changed from a slight chirp to more of a grinding sound.  Admittedly,
a 46mm socket is not something I carried in my toolbox at the time so I was
forced to continue home on the problem. I did futilely attempt channel
locks (adjustable rectangular pliers...you probably call em something else)
but they wouldnt spin the nut enough to get the cotter pin thru the next
choice.  

         Also, I noticed an increase in low frequency hum from my tranny. 
This concerned me much greater than the axle chirping ($).

        When I returned safely home, I applied a bunch of torque to the
axle nut (appr 1/8th of a turn - very little) and after about 4 months, I
havent heard anything from the wheel area again.  Spinning it freely
indicates no binding or sheering on behalf of the axle bearing.

        Regarding the tranny hum, the list prepared me for the worst
indicating that my tranny had worn out and was on its last legs.  Well,
luckily, all I did was change the gear oil in the tranny, which was really
clean looking in contrast to engine oil, and &quot;Ta Dah&quot; the humming went
away.

        Call me lucky but do keep in mind, my '69 is a daily driver so I
have the luxury of testing out every weak link in my bus to the fullest. 
Ten thousand more miles from your symptoms and going strong.
