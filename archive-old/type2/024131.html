Frank,

I am trying to answer the same question.  Here is what I have gleaned so far 
from posts on this list and another.

Simplest, most reliable and accurate seems to be the &quot;Berg Dipstick Sender&quot; 
that sends a flashing signal to your oil pressure light.  I haven't checked 
price etc. yet, but I think this is what I will get.

A more complex option and with the distinct possibility of less accuracy and 
reliability seems to be the cheapest line of gauges from VDO and others.  It 
would appear that you get what you pay for. A lot of people say they feel 
they work fine and can be relied on.  Just as many say they are NOT accurate, 
need to be checked and calibrated somehow but will let you know if temps 
stray out of your typical range.

More expensive gauges got better reviews, some suggested aircraft quality 
gauges as being the most accurate.

There also seems to be a lot of controversy surrounding where the sender 
should be.  I am not enough of an engineer to fully understand this flurry of 
exchanged posts.  Seems maybe the most accurate location is too tap the 
sender somewhere into a main oil galley????
