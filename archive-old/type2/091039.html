Subject: Re: 2.0 oil drain plug

I got the 14 mm drain plug from Bus Boys.  It went in
OK, but when it reached the point where I thought it
should tighten, it didn't.  So I'm thinking the PO
must have stripped the thread.

However, it is *fairly* tight and doesn't leak and
hasn't loosened after running several errands around
LA in 90 degree heat.

I was thinking about taking it out, wrapping it with
thread tape, reinstalling it and permanently leaving
it in place.  However my vw mechanic friend (whom I
trust) suggested I keep an eye on it and just leave
the plug alone and not to use it anymore as long as it
doesn't leak or loosen.

Either way I'll now be changing the oil - carefully - 
through the screen plate from this point on. 

- Randy
