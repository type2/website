Subject: Re: [T2] Riviera tops

You could always consider a permanent hit-top.  Mine appears to just be
attached with self tapping screws around the lower periphery of the top,
just above the drip rail and covered by a piece of trim.  The plus is that
you get tons of extra permanent storage space for lighter items, you can
have extra windows or ventilators, no canvas worries, you can stand up in
the bus anytime or carry oversized items as long as it fits through the door
:)  The down side is extra sail area and it wont fit in a normal garage.
You could probably find a used one cheap.

Cheers,

Does anyone know if Riviera tops can be retrofitted with Westy tops?  I have
an 80 Riviera, and the top is cracking badly.  I was hoping the hole in the
roof would be the same size, since the Riviera vans came from the factory
with the hole already in them.  Thanks, Nik
