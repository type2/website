&gt; &gt; Well the load range &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; is for LT tires
&gt; &gt; only, I agree.  And I'm away from both Bently and

&gt; &gt; not a LT185/14.  Our loaf busses were made long
&gt; &gt; before the current load/speed rating system, for
&gt; &gt; example the &quot;98S&quot; found on the sidewall of the
&gt; &gt; Liberators.   Anyway, I feel real comfortable
&gt; 
&gt; You are right to some extent.  The actual spec is for a sidewall-reinforced
&gt; passenger tire.  The reinforced sidewall allows less side to side &quot;roll&quot;
&gt; when driving, and also allows a higher inflation rate. Same with a load
&gt; range C or D tire, so it's basically comparable in that regard.  I don't

&gt; tire is rated to handle. That said, many people use passenger car tires on
&gt; busses (in fact, from the busses I've seen, most people do), so you are by
&gt; no means alone in doing it.  I personally have not heard of any actual tire
&gt; failures resulting from doing so, although I have noticed a handling
&gt; improvements when using a stiffer sidewall.

over the years I have had at least two tread seperations when I put the
wrong tires on my bus, in both cases I was lucky and didn't even lose
control BUT changing the tires was still a PITA not to mention the $$$

I now have 99S Michelin tires and the peace of mind and handling are worth
the $125 each they cost.
