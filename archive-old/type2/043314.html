Subject: 71 Leaking Oil, Smoking

Relative newbie here. I just bought a 71 that I plan on restoring in time. In 
the meantime, I'm going to enjoy driving her around. But I need some help 
with some diagnosis and direction first.

The engine leaks oil, especially on the right side and when she gets hot 
smoke comes out from under the bus on the right side, some from under the 
bumper, some from in front of the right rear wheel. It's black smoke, smells 
like oil. The whole right side of the engine is pretty soaked, and there's a 
small puddle on the tin as well. The oil light has not come on at all while 
driving, and her POs added oil as needed. 

Other symptom: she stalls out when I come to a stop.

Otherwise she's in pretty good shape, she's a Colorado bus so pretty minor 
rust compared to Jersey busses (where I'm at).  The POs drove her here from 
Colorado this summer, and she does 60 with no problem. 

I'd like to know where ti begin with tracking down the source of the leak and 
the stalling--and does anything need to be adjusted since we're at a much 
lower altitude here than CO). I've read some of the archives, and I see the 
first step is to get the engine cleaned and then watch closely. What else?
