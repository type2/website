Dear know-it-alls  :-)

(Just kidding.)

Lurch has a 1600CC DP carburated engine.  Today, while driving around town, 
Lurch backfired REAL LOUD twice (while downshifting).  I have noticed lately 
that the vacuum gauge flutters (at around 15 psi) at idle.  Compression on #3 
is around 90#, compared to 125# in the others.  To me, this adds up to burned 
exhaust valve.  I did not test the compression further by squirting oil in 
the cylinder.  I suppose that would help confirm my suspicions, no?  I've got 
a spare engine in the garage that I could cannibalize at least one head off 
of -- the other has stripped spark plug holes.  What say you?

Thanks
