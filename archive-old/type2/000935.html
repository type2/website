Volks,
 I have a very simple question, I am installing some external oil coolers
and I was wondering when you put the hose adapter over the stock oil filter,
which way does the oil flow? Center hole is input to the motor or exiting
from the motor?? I just want to make sure I have cool oil going to the
motor.

Thanks
Brad
