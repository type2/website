&gt;   I changed my oil today and found that the studs are too short to firmly

if you are talking about the 6 small bolts in a circular pattern,
the nuts that go on these should not be tightened very much. But I
wonder how did you put the plate back on? It should be installed so
that the flat side is right next to the case. just a thought.
