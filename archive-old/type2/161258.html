Subject: Re: [T2] Sound deadening...

&gt;       Anyway, I had a quick question about sound deadening. I'm  
&gt; completely restoring a Porsche 944 that I bought really cheap. I've  
&gt; been using dynamat in many hidden places, trying to give the car a  
&gt; more refined interior sound.

My friend is currently applying this product to his Lotus:

I've logged a lot of hours in the passenger seat so I can let you  
know how it turns out when he's done and the car is back on the road.

&gt; And... it got me thinking. The Bus motor I have is quite loud. It's  
&gt; significantly improved since I installed the factory muffler I  
&gt; bought from Bus Depot. But... I guess what I'm trying to figure out  
&gt; is, is it worth it to install sound deadening materials in the Bus?  
&gt; I mean, I don't expect it to be quiet like a Mercedes or a Lincoln  
&gt; interior, but, with the power of the Bus being what it is... what  
&gt; would 60 pounds of dynamat and jute backing do for it?

The mattress in the back of the westy goes a long way to reducing  
some of the engine noise but like others say the tire and wind noise  
is what's loudest.
