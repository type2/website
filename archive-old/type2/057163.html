   Yes, you're right - I misthought on Bentley, however, VW does call
them Rear and so does every parts catalog. RMMW, for instance, calls the
flywheel seal the &quot;rear&quot; and the other the &quot;crankshaft, fan end&quot;. Seems
logical to me to refer to parts the same way VW does, otherwise
confusion reigns. It's also fairly logical, if, when you are looking
into the engine compartment from the hatch, to refer to the stuff
farthest away as at the *rear* of the compartment, or *rear* of the
engine. 
   Oh well. Maybe we should just try not to refer to &quot;rear&quot; seals at
all, but to flywheel and fan seals.
