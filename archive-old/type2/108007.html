Subject: Re: [T2] BB in vacuum line?

&gt; I was wondering if it had something to do with emissions. The carbon
 cannister does have a hose that runs into that same round cannister on the
 air cleaner that the vac advance line connects.

That would be kinda stupid to plug that line, unless the EEC purge valve on the back of the air cleaner leaks.
If the valve leaks, you will not have vacuum advance. The valve is not available separate. Only comes with the
air cleaner half. The valve opens when you accelerate and allows venturi vacuum to suck the fumes out of the
charcoal cannister.
