Subject: Backfiring thru carbs...Real fire!

Hey Y'all,
72 Project Westy, stock dual carbs. When I start the
bus, it will idle nicely for a few minutes, then it
starts backfiring up thru the carbs, like REALLY
backfiring, you can see the flames shooting up. What
are some causes of this??? Timing?? Run too rich???
What else??

Peace, John Baker

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
