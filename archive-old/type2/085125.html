Subject: Re: [T2] Acid wash primer/sealers

Dupont Vari prime is an excellent acid etch, zinc chromate primer--it is
not clear by any means--kinda yellow / green.

And the best high fill, easy to sand primer that I have found is Sherwin
Williams Ultra Fill----

Have Fun----

Later,

Terry

[T2] Acid wash primer/sealers 
In speaking with the gentleman who is going to be eventually painting
Possum this spring he recommended that I sand the bus down to bare metal
and then apply an acid wash primer prior to spraying a high build
primer. He said that this stuff is usually clear and will help prevent
rust from recurring. Can anyone recommend such a product? I am imagining
that this is essentially a sealer to be followed by a suitable high
build primer such as &quot;fill-and-sand&quot;. 
I looked at the POR-15 site and they had some stuff that looked like
what I am looking for but I figured I would as you guys. I think I am
going to call Metalwiz and see what they think.
