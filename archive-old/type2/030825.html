Subject: Poptop springs overhaul ('74-'79)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.HPP.3.91.990701102518.11817G-100000_at_cmr.sph.unc_dot_edu&gt;

Has anyone attempted to adjust or replace the springs and wires inside 
the poptop support poles? My top is gettin go to be a PITA to lift. (Or 
is it that I'm getting weaker? :)

Of course it doesn't help that I often have 60+ pounds of toys up 
there....
