Christa and I have a '76 Westy, and while we don't generally do a lot of
real off-road (meaning no road) driving, we do manage to do a few thousand
miles of unpaved driving every summer on surfaces with varying demands on
the vehicle and driver.  Most of these roads are logging road mainlines,
which are generally in pretty good shape.  Last summer, we did the Inuvik
trip, and the road surface on the Dempster and other unpaved roads in the
Yukon, Alaska, and Northern B.C. was almost universally excellent, with the
exception of sharp shale and some mud in spots.  (For anyone interested in
heading up that way, the Dempster is a gorgeous drive, and the surface is
far better than I expected--as near a &quot;highway&quot; as I've seen off-pavement
in Canada, and far better even than most logging road mainlines here in
B.C.).

As for things to watch out for if you choose to head off road (or at least
off-pavement), consider the suggestions below.  Usual disclaimers apply.  I
take absolutely no responsibility if you get stuck, bang up or roll your
bus.  The real off-road nut is Derek Drew, who has a water-pumper syncro
and is probably still on the vanagon list, but he's waaay too extreme for
me--I mean he's *nuts!*   If you're into &quot;real&quot; off-roading, ask him for
advice.

Heading off the pavement can be more wearing on a vehicle than sticking to
the Interstate, but in my opinion exploring off pavement is the way to find
the really great camping spots--and buses are meant to be enjoyed, not
protected from every possible harm.  Just please drive with your thinking
caps on since a momentary lapse of judgement is potentially a lot more
serious 100 km up a dirt track than on the Interstate.

Drive with your headlights on at all times on dirt roads.  I drive with my
high beams on during the day.  The point of this is to make yourself as
visible as possible.

It is imperative you learn where the track of the driver's side and
passenger's side wheels are.  You'll need to do this to get traction on
loose climbs, avoid sharp/big rocks or deep ruts in front of you, or
(always a good anus-clencher) getting the tires on the set of planks that
constitute a bridge deck.

Learn where the lowest parts on the undercarriage are, and drive to avoid
whacking these parts on the larger obstructions.  In your '77, the tranny
is probably the lowest part.  Lie in front of your bus and see for
yourself, though.  If you've got a standard propane tank hanging down
behind the front wheel, check that the skid plate can protect the valve.
Learn how much ground clearance you have there.

Buses have pretty good ground clearance for a vehicle designed for pavement
use, but the problem you'll most often encounter is the approach angle,
which is that big overhang in front of the front wheels.  If the surface
gets very lumpy, you'll be plowing or digging with the front bumper.  I
don't let this bother me too much, since the bumper is pretty robust.  Keep
your speed down, naturally, and you will find that with practice you can
time it so that you get to the place where you may plow the bumper as the
front end is bouncing *up* thereby lessening or entirely avoiding an
approach angle problem.  In first gear, the throttle can be quite effective
at lifting the front end when you want to, providing of course that you
have enough traction to do so.

Departure angle is a lesser concern on the bus, but something you have to
keep in mind since bus exhaust systems are very pricey so you don't want to
be beating anything up back there.  VW produced a technical recommendation
for &quot;driving under difficult conditions&quot; that has specs for fabricating
skid plates to protect the engine and exhaust on buses and vanagons.  I
haven't made these skid plates up, but I believe a few people on the list
have.  So far I've gotten off lucky, with only a cracked header pipe,
dented heater boxes, a sheared J-pipe, and a totally munched muffler.  I've
had all but the heater boxes repaired.  Yeah, my exhaust is pretty loud.
Yeah, I probably could have fabbed up the skid plates for what I've paid in
damaged exhaust parts.  But I live in an apartment and don't have a garage
I can build things in.  :-(

I've only high-centered the bus once, and that was because I made a boo-boo.

As far as maximum lean angle goes, I've never pushed far to find out.
We've probably done somewhere between 25 and 30 degrees, but it's real hard
to tell things like that in the bush.  More important than actual angle is
the rate at which the bus is rolling side-to-side when the lean gets
substantial.  Keep it flat, and keep the speed down when the surface
creates a substantial rocking motion.  Steering gets weird when the bus
leans hard to one side, so be prepared for that.

Don't drive at night unless you already know the road really well.  There
are no reflective markers in the bush showing you where the road is.  The
shallow angle of the headlights creates black void on the far side of a
slight rise in the raod ahead of you that will hide the place where the
bridge was until it was washed out last week.  A lot of animals come out on
to the roads at night, and I'd hate to hit a bull moose or bear in a bus.
Besides, you'll be missing all the scenery!

CHECK YOUR BRAKES before heading off pavement.  I once had an embarassing
and rather scary experience when I had to back down a steep loose track and
found my rear brakes were enough out of adjustment that they weren't doing
much to slow me down and my front brakes were only dragging along, locking
up.  Heel- and-toeing a bus using both the brakes and first gear to stop
while steering backwards down a steep twisty double track in the mountains
is a situation I would not like to repeat.  My brakes seemed fine on
pavement, and I had adjusted them only a couple weeks before.
   Now I actually jack up the bus and take 5 or 10 minutes to make sure the
brakes are good and tight before we drive anywhere with steep loose
surfaces.  Brakes wear a lot faster off pavement, since they often get very
hot running down long steep mountain grades in a very dusty environment.

Make sure your mirrors can fold back easily without breaking off when you
have to brush against trees or bushes.  Actually, get a feel for the width
of the whole bus while you're at it, BUT DON'T CUT IT TOO CLOSE, since a
rocking bus has a substatially wider effective width than a stationary one,
or one on smooth flat pavement.

Many dirt roads were built for, and still primarily serve, heavy industrial
truck traffic.  Watch for signs that industrial vehicles are using the
road, and drive carefully to give them a very wide berth.  In B.C. many of
the logging roads are only 15 feet wide or less.  A logging truck can
easily be 10 feet wide or more.  If a road is posted as being closed to the
public due to active logging or whatever, find another road.  Often roads
with active logging will have the radio frequency for Operations Control
posted at the junction with the highway or mainline.  If you've got a
two-way FM, I'm sure they'd appreciate hearing from you so they know where
you are.

STUFF TO BRING:
Good maps, a compass, and a knowledge of how to use them.

Throw a 6 gallon jerry can on the roof for insurance, and carry extra fuel
line.  If a root snags your fuel lines, you'll need both the extra line
*and* the gas.

Bring tire chains and a good length of strong rope.  A yank strap is great
if you bog down close to good ground so your friend can rip you out.  Bring
a good jack or two, ones with a good high lift.  You'll also need a couple
of planks to provide footing for the jack.

Pack along a couple of the cone-shaped rubber suspension bushings that
limit the upwards travel of the front wheels.  I knock one or two off each
year, and the suspension will really slam home hard without the bushing.
Check you've got them on your bus before you head off pavement, since in
normal paved road driving the suspension usually doesn't travel far enough
to need the rubber stop.  You can get the stop from a wrecker for next to
nothing, since pavement driving seldom wears them out.

And of course, bring your tools and spare parts.

So my advice is this: by all means leave the confines of pavement and
explore the rivers, lakes, and mountains that are hidden away from the
masses blasting along the main highways in their Winnibagoes.  Prepare
yourself and your bus, and plan to be as self-sufficient as possible.

Take your time, enjoy the journey for the journey's sake, and be prepared
to turn back if things aren't working out.  Stop and smell the flowers.
Watch the beaver swimming, as it watches you.  Allow yourself extra time
for all your off-pavement driving--if you make the trip a lot faster than
you anticipated, find a nice stream and fish, or pop the top and nap, or
whatever.  Chances are there'll be nobody around bother you, whatever you
decide to do.  Try doing that at the side of a paved highway.
