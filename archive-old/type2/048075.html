Subject: Re: [T2] Parking Brakes Stuck!!!

&gt; Is it possible for something to happen in 36 hours that would cause the
&gt; parking brakes to stick?? I was driving in the rain, so could it be rust??
&gt;

When I bought my bug I let it sit for a couple weeks while I had the engine
out doing work on it.  When I finally got my engine back in, I was so
excited.  I started the engine, put it in reverse, and promptly became
hysterical when the bug wouldn't move.  After checking that I didn't put my
tranny in backwerds and my CVs were there, I got back in the car, put it in
reverse, revved the engine, and dropped the clutch.  The rear end rose up, I
heard a snap, and I was suddenly moving very quickly, backwards,  toward the
road.  I guess after sitting outside the shoes had stuck themselves to the
drums.  It was probably stupid of me to just &quot;rev the engine and drop the
clutch&quot; but I was mad and I do stupid things when I'm mad.  Moral of the
story: It's probably just rust.  If it isn't, have fun in pinkie!! J/K :)
