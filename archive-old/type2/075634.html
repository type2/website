&gt; &gt; That's for sure, Al. Always validate the filter and flow before condeming
&gt; &gt; things down stream. That's the order of things per Bentley.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Mark:
&gt; &gt; &gt;I think the filter or intake pipe is plugged. NO $127 or $220 pump will
&gt; &gt; &gt;make up for that!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Try compressed air on the gas filler if fuel doesn't run out. As a last
&gt; &gt; &gt;resort, blow it backwards. Be really careful to only allow about 20-30 PSI
&gt; &gt; &gt;into the tank, they are not made to be an air compressor tank!

&gt; REMOVE GAS CAP FIRST!
&gt; make sure no one is on side of bus opposite the gas cap.
&gt;
&gt; then blow
