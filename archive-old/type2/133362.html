&gt; i have a auto matic transmission in my 76 camper bus i need to have it toyed
&gt; about 10 miles will this screw up the transmission

VW says less than 30 miles at less than 30 MPH, personally I would
disconect the half shafts.  the auto tranny gets no lube at all when the
engine is not running,

personally I always try to tow mine on a trailer or rollback truck

YMMV
