Subject: Headlight current source

Hello
I was doing a light check yesterday, and found that sometine yesterday, my
headlights quit.  I have the bentley, and can figure out the circuits, but I
cannot figure out where the current is supplied for the headlight circuit.
Does it come from the terminal on the starter?  Or someplace else?
They worked for a little while yesterday, so I am asuming I either have a
badly corroded connection somewhere, or perhaps a flaky ground.

Thanks!
