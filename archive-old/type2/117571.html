&gt; if anyone on the dear list has had similar experiences, let
&gt; us know.

sounds like it may be running rich, the stroke of the piston in the fuel
pump controls how much gas is injected.

use the DM and check the fan, the intake air, the exhaust for
blockage. also use the method in the manual for your heater to adjust how
much fuel is being pumped on each strok

good luck
YMMV
