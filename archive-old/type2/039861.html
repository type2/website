&gt; Ok, all this tech talk about volts and milliamps and what kind of meter
&gt; to buy -- h_at_ll, I paid $20 for the one I've got, and I've got about $5

I've been using meters for 40+ years and still prefer a $20 analog meter,
have about a dozen or so,  I find the ones that &quot;beep&quot; for continuity
really are a lot of help and unless you are really doing very precise (to
several decimal places) the analog meters are better than the digital
ones.  pick up some extra test leads and a set of jumper test leads.  I
also made up one of my own test leads that is about 20ft long for &quot;Front
to Back&quot; testing which I have found useful in working on buses

&gt; ownership, where I've just (finally) mastered the concept that volts is
&gt; how much power your battery is putting out and continuity tells you if a
&gt; circuit is complete or not (when that's a good thing or not, I'm still
&gt; not sure).


simple basic rule to remember, &quot;Ohm's law&quot;


Volts  X  Amps  =   Watts  

measure all loads in watts, and do the simple math

&gt; All I know is the batteries went dead after I replaced the coil in the
&gt; desert last month (I've switched back to the old one), and they always
&gt; worked fine before. BTW, the coil is what serves as the isolator between
&gt; my main and auxiliary batteries: key on = main battery; key off =
&gt; auxiliary battery. Somehow it seems the replacement coil got that
&gt; confused. I have no idea how or why. Ever since then, I've been in
&gt; battery h_at_ll.


the coil is not a switch, the fact that it worked before is more &quot;luck&quot;
than anything.  the coil should be isolated from power whenever the engine
is not running,  power to the coil is switched but the points in the
dizzy, if switched on and the points are closed (or is that open??) the
coil will overheat and can literally burn or melt.  if this doesn't kill
the coil it will flatten the battery and probably damage the dizzy
electrical parts too.
