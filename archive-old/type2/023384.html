Boston Bob has been on vacation, I just had a nice chat with him last
weekend in Cali.

ps. In my conversation with Bob concerning 1.8 and 2 litre engines I asked
him about heads dropping seats. 1 of the things he does is have a custom
ground cam made. The purpose of this is to let the exhaust valves sit a
little longer to help cool them done, he has found this to solve the dropped
seat problem on these engines. He is a wealth of information on above
mentioned engines and worth the wait to talk to him for info, even if you
don't buy his engine. Also a phone call will always get hold of him.

I recommend and use NW Connecting Rod. They are in Seattle in the
industrial district south of Alaska Way. Every Sunday, if not every day,
they have a classified ad in the automotive section of the PI/Times. You
will get quality parts and workmanship and a motor that will last under
proper installation and maintenance. Lots of VW knowledge in their shop.
They do both air cooled and Wasserboxers as well as the 4cly inlines both
gas and diesel. A seriously good machine shop and builder.

I've had no problems whatsoever with 5 or 7 engines from them in as many
years. Sorry, I don't have their phone no. here at home, but any Yellow
pages will find them.

&gt;Hey there,

&gt;  I've been trying to email that highly recommended Boston Bob engine
&gt;builder but haven't gotten any response in the last two weeks.
&gt;  I'm starting to think I should look for a local builder to avoid such
&gt;unresponsiveness. Anybody know a really good Northwest engine builder?
