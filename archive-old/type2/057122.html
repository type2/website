Subject: Timing marks on '81 Westy

I apologize for what may be a dumb question here, but I can't find an
answer in any references.  I'm trying to check the timing on our '81
Westy, 2.0 liter, and have no trouble finding the timing scale mounted
beside the pulley, but can't find a reference mark anywhere on the
pulley.  Where is the pulley mark and what does it look like?

I'm checking the timing because the engine has recently been very
difficult to start when warm (starts great when cold).  I'm planning a
tuneup this weekend.

Thanks,

Mark
