Subject: Re: [T2] shifting

Darren,

Classic symptom of a miswired or shorted backup switch.

Check your wiring and where the power going to the backup lights is coming 
from.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; I recently had the shifting problem of going from 3rd to 2nd and 2nd to 1st.
&gt; It was super hard to find.Chris gave me the suggestions and I followed his words.
&gt; I greased the shifter shaft and replaced the shifting coupler.Now I can shift
&gt; oh so fine except one other thing....when I go to put it in reverse it dies out.
&gt; I can put it in reverse but the engine dies.even with my foot on the clutch it 
&gt; and if its in reverse it won't start . I put it in any other gear with the clutch in
&gt; and it starts no problem.I just need to know how to remedy this problem.
&gt; Thanks
