Subject: Re: [T2] Flooded engine

the engine compartment has a negative pressure (compared to atmospheric)
when going down the road. The fan and carb(s) are sucking in more then is
being &quot;forced&quot; in thru the vents, regardless of year.

This being said, the hot air area under the engine is a lot more positive
pressure then the engine bay, you can figure out the rest. It's a good idea
to keep that sucker as isolated as possible.
