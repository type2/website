Subject: OEM hub caps

&gt;Btlmex isn't selling to the public anymore but they advertized
&gt;an OEM German hubcap:

     http://www.btlmex_dot_com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&amp;ProdID=96

OK, do we need to refresh out recollection on the term  OEM???

http://www.acronymfinder_dot_com/af-query.asp?String=exact&amp;Acronym=OEM&amp;Find=Find

&quot;&quot;    Original Equipment Manufacturer  &quot;&quot;

This refers to the ManufacturER!! not to the product.

See this ref in the libtrary:

     http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/069476.html

Delta Six is an OEM to the Westfalia, and anything they now or in the future 
produce (related to the Westfalia??) could be categorized as OEM.  If Deltx 
Six made these hubcaps, and they were placed on Westfalias, no doubt about 
it, they could be tagged as OEM...

And the Ron Salmon posting:

I just had an education from Steve Dolan on Italian olive oil, where the 
olives are brought into Italy and processed there.  Not GROWN in Italy.

If the box says 'Made in Germany' it could mean that just the box is made in 
Germany.  (If it says 'Made in West Germany', this could be some NOS stuff 
that was packagged before the lawyers got into the picture..)

Which hubcaps are German made and non-German made can be diistinguished by:

    The German hubcaps extraction holes will always be 'open', where you can 
slip that liittle 'U' clip through the two holes to pull the hubcaps.  The 
non-German ones usually cover the holes very slightly so the extraction clip 
will not fit. This is a visual assessment.

    The German hubcaps have a sharply raised VW, very noticeable to the 
touch and also visual; the non-German hubcaps have not such a sharp 
definition, and the difference can be seen and felt.
