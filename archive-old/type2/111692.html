Subject: Re: [T2] Need advice on adjusting Rear Torsion Bars

&gt; Well the old Bus is dragging its rear a little bit and could use a boost.

Make sure that it is.  Put the bus on level pavement with a driver in the
driver's seat.  See if the cargo floor is level.  If it is, you don't need
to adjust the torsion bars.

The bus naturally sits a bit nose-high
without a driver and unless you have the early  _long_ mirror you cannot
see the horizon out of the rear window in the rear-view mirror!

&gt;  I have a Haynes book on the transporter, but the instructions on adjusting
&gt; the reat torsion bars are a wee bit obtuse for me.
&gt;
&gt; Any advice from someone who has actually performed the torsion bar adjustment
&gt; would be greatly appreciated.

Get the Bentley, shoot Liquid Wrench on all the bolts you will remove
every day for a week before you do the job, make sure the cargo floor of
the bus is level before making any measurements on the trailing arms, and
work carefully.  Resist the urge to dial in a bit more height unless you
like strange handling and lousy CV and tire wear.

Allow a full weekend to do this.  You might get it done quicker, but you
don't want to be rushed.  It's not difficult, just requires some care.
