This is an obvious suggestion, but did you check the cold start injector?
Its on the black manifold box.

Hi again all,

This time I have an easy one for you.  My 79 ASI has a REAL hard time
starting on a cold morning (and by cold I only mean about 40 degrees).
After she is running, she runs perfectly, it is just the starts that are
rough.  Any ideas as to how I can fix this?  I have owned 4 type2's and
never had this problem.  Also, She gets regular tune ups, so I don't think
it is caused by neglect of engine care.

Thanks again for your help,
Nick
