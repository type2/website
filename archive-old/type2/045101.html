You know, Wade, if you leave some of the lower tinware screws loose, you
can get the can sound-effect without even tying on the cans!

Congrats and best wishes for a long and happy marriage.

&gt;Wade,
&gt;
&gt;Congrats there bro.  I wonder if he's going to the honeymoon in his bus
(with cans attached)?
