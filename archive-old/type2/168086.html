Sounds like a cool bus, when you say water-injection are you referring to
CIS? Its a gret conversion, what do you recommend for this conversion?

&gt;        The other day in Auckland I happened to notice rolling into a
&gt; petrol station a dark blue '64 splitty with no windows except front
&gt; seat &amp; windscreen, big chrome VW emblem on front, no air scoops on
&gt; the intake louvres, and extremely lowered suspension  -  altogether a
&gt; downright groovy appearance.
&gt;        The owner had just brought it from Nelson, a lower-rust
&gt; region in the S. Is.  He told me he'd merely &quot;inverted the spindles&quot;
&gt; to achieve the lowest ground-clearance as seen in
&gt; http://www.busselecta_dot_com/bus/.
&gt;        I sooled him onto air scoops for the intake louvres  -  a new
&gt; idea on him.  Also - and I know T2 listees will find this difficult
&gt; to believe  -  I told him how to slap water-injection into his 1500
&gt; SP.
