&gt; Your manual, Clymer's has been reputed to have some errors. I've

How well I know!!!  I've got the Clymer, Bentley, Haynes and Wilson books 
and spend half my time trying to reconcile them!!

Wilson, so far, has been the most accurate but it's sometimes difficult 
to pick out the comments about my engine(s) from all the rest of the 
chatter.  In many ways the Bentley is the most disapointing since it's 
not had some very &quot;fundamental&quot; information I've needed, e.g., crank 
journal diameters.
