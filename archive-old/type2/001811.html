When did VW start using basket-weave pattern?
I was at a wrecking yard today and looked at the rear seats of 2 71 buses.
Both were white basket-weave. Did this start in 68?  Or was it used in 67
and older buses?
Thanks
PS- last week I pmailed a few 67 bus owners with a wiring question,
unfortunately this #&amp;$% computor crashed Thursday and all my mail went with
it....
