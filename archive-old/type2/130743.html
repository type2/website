Subject: Re: [VB] Dumbest camping thing I have ever done

Hello Tedebare    Not too dumb  at least you didnt drive there and find an 
empty campground.  I did that once at Manassas Bug Out  Hot VWs had the date 
wrong drove all the way there and found out the show was the day before!!!  
Looking forward to Eb and seeing you guys and the CHERRIES   I'm going to take some 
pixs of 4 of my splits parked out in front of the shop today hope to post 
them later   and have fun  Mark Dearing
