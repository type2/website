Support the transmission with a jack.  Then using a GOOD hydraulic jack
placed directly under the drain plate of the engine, pull back and remove
the engine by itself.  No need to remove the transmission, much easier this
way. you can always remove the trany later it only weighs 70 lbs. and on the
71 the engine and transmission  are much easier to do separately!!!
It's a piece of cake! You can do it!
Good Luck,

&gt; &gt; &gt; I recently obtained a 71 Westy. I want to remove the engine and being
&gt; &gt; &gt; completely new to Buses I was planning on using the directions on
Muir's
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You have to decide if you want to pull the engine and the transmission
as
&gt; &gt; a unit or to support the tranmission and pull the engine alone.  Both
&gt; &gt; methods work well.
&gt;
&gt; On an early loaf I would never consider pulling the engine and tranny
&gt; together. Its so easy to pull the motor and then if you want the tranny
&gt; out there is plenny room to get to the CVs.
&gt; Id estimate thats its more than twice the work to pull them together and
&gt; what a load to handle.
