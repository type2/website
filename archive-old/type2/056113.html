I've hit some delays in my engine building project, and find that I need
a running upright engine for my '71 passenger bus to get it on the road
sooner than my home-built engine will be ready.  I'm in Baltimore, and
can pick up the engine in my '74 within a reasonable driving distance.
I'd be particularly interested in making a trade.  I have a lot of late
bus stuff and other aircooled VW stuff, plus misc other euro-car parts,
not to mention the high-mileage running '83 C*r*ll_at_ (which I'd trade for
almost anything VW!).
