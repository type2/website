&lt;&lt; Does anyone know the ISBN for that new VW Bus book - the one with all the 
pics

from HCBF 2002?


BTW, does Type2_dot_com have an affiliate account with Amazon? It's an easy way to

make money for the list. The list can get a percentage of each book sold.


 &gt;&gt;
 Vote no...'Cause then the list would also be subject to all the spam that
Amazon (and do they really only have one ?-) can sling...;-(
