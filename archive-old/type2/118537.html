Subject: Re: [T2] oil temp gauge question

Ramsay, while you are running wire, why not use trailer cable with its 5
wires of all different colors and all in a tube too, leave the others taped
off and the spares will be useful soon I am sure. Barry W
.


&gt; Does anyone have
&gt; advice on how to route the connecting wire to the oil drain
&gt; plug sender?
