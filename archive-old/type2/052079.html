Help!  I need to have my 1600 case line bored, and there is nobody in
this area who will touch a VW!  Does anyone know of a machinist in the
North Louisiana general area that will undertake this?  I hate to lose
this case because I've already had a generic shop cut the cylinder holes
for my 90.5's.  Thanks-

-Pat
Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most.
