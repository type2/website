&gt;I would *love* to see a source for NOS or replacement FI wiring harnesses,
&gt;but will not hold my breath :-) Also remember that the harness changed
&gt;every year, with the 79&gt; harnesses coming in Federal and CA versions
&gt;

As I've been thinking about this little business myself I'll note today for
giggles I priced an '81 harness (buses are NLA) can you say something like
$825 !!!!!

Geesh.

But Steve is right I think to make it doable on a small scale and do it
right we'd be talking about $200-$300 per harness.
