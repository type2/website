Listvolks,

I paid a visit to Lurch in the &quot;hospital&quot; and the work is going along fine, 
but slow.
A new nose was put on from top to bottom -- the way to go since the old one 
had been wrecked, patched, and pulled out more than once.  The holes in the 
back of the wheel wells (plus some other rusts) were also fixed.  I asked the 
body guy  about Kool-patch, and he didn't like it.  He said it never really 
dries and you can't paint over it.  I didn't ask him for other sound 
deadening recommendations.  

Hopefully it will be done in time for a July 4th campout with a fellow listee 
(it's been three weeks and he promised it in two -- I told him to take his 
time).

I will go back today and help with the wiring before they remount the dash.  
I have several gauges (tach, volt, amp, vacuum, oil press., cyl head temp), 
but that's a subject for another post!
