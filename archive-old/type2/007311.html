&gt;russell - 
&gt;typically the 2.0 engine will indeed have hydraulic lifters and thus 
solid (rather than hollow) push rods. 

Only 2.0L engines from '78-'83 had hydraulic lifters.  The first two 
years of the 2.0, '76 and '77, did not have them.

FWIW, I've had two hydraulic 2.0L engines and neither of them has had 
solid pushrods.  All pushrods in both engines have been hollow.  I 
wasn't the original owner of either, so I don't know if they came that 
way, but I also don't know why anyone would bother switching pushrods 
around :-)

BTW, I also have a spare 2.0L engine from an early Vanagon with 
hydraulic lifters.  All pushrods in that engine were also hollow.
