Mr. Schwarze,

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe you are attempting to point out 
that Mobil-1 synthetic oil both:
	a) breaks down at a higher temp
	b) lubricates well even at these higher temps (what weight are you 
		running, anyway?)

It would be worth noting that you are running a type-4 engine (although I 
figure that just about everyone on the list is aware of this), and as 
such, you have a full flow filter.  In addition, type-4's tend to run 
hotter than type-1's...

I, too, have gotten over my fear of somewhat high oil temps, albeit for a
type-1 engine.  This summer, I managed to cope with running at 230-235 
despite the gut feeling that my engine was going to go &quot;thud&quot;.  

My only issue with running synthetic would be that I tend to follow two 
guidelines for oil changes:
	a) changes should happen somewhere around the 1500-2000 mile mark
	b) changes should take place sooner if the oil is 
		dark/discolored/dirty (ala Herr Doktor, Tim)

As such, I expect that it would get mighty expensive, were I to run 
synthetic without moving to a full flow filter.  

The flipside of this is that I now have a job and will probably be a 
little more anxious to &quot;get where I'm going&quot;, and as such, moving to 
synthetic, even at the higher cost, might be worth it to me, should it 
afford some sort of additional protection against &quot;failure&quot;.  And perhaps 
offset the cost of building out one of the 3 cores that I seem to have 
acquired over the last 2 months, should my trusty (ha!) 1600dp fail.

If I have missed any points on your vouching for synthetic, please fill us 
in.

	-tom
	-who may throw said 1600dp into his new '67 bus to see if the 
		temps run as high in that, which I expect they will
