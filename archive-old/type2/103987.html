Subject: Re: [VB] Re: space bus/ Quality Bus clip drawings

The cartoon of the MIR space station was in the Seattle paper.
This was at the time of the Mir space station woes, they had an uncontrolled 
fire for 40  minutes!
I have saved a file somewhere.
Let me do a search.
I will post to the list a link to a piccy on my website when it is there.
