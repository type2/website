Subject: Re: [vanagon] 16th Annual Twin Cities Volkswagen Show

Just a reminder of the Twin Cities, Minnesota, Volkwagen Show.  It will be at 
Rudy Luther's West Side Volkswagen just off County Road 100 in Saint Louis 
Park, a west Minneapolis suburb, from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on 9 June 2002.

I hope that we get more Type IIs there this year.
