Subject: my carb.
Mime-Version: 1.0

i need to find out what kind of carburetor i have.  i took it out today to 
clean it up.  it is on a 1975 Westy with a 1978 engine.

there is number on the side:  L7760
below that is:  2571

it is a single carb. w/ two square openings under the filter (which is also 
square and rests on top of the carb.)

it doesn't look like any of the carbs. in my bentley manual or the one 
illustrated in Muir's book.

thanks for any info!!!
