Subject: Re: [T2] WANTED: 71 Westy (with certain features)

I want the extra tire below me... as well as on the front, as I will be 
safariing (possibly). At the rear tire well, I am going to install a gas 
heater in that location... and I HATE wrapping my arm around a smelly tire 
at night !

Yep, agreed with a mod... but would rather have it stock (like my old 71 
Westy... grown used to it).

&gt;Why non walkthrough only?  Also, the spare tire in the 71 Westy went in the 
&gt;rear (I covered the hole and hung it on the front).
&gt;Back in the days of pre- marriage, I did this to our 71 Westy with 
&gt;walkthrough.  Made for cozy driving (-8
&gt;You can modify it to take the 2 person seat- (not sure where I got 
&gt;it-splitty?)- it involved 2 HD hinges along the front mounted to the seat 
&gt;pedestal top, and a slot cut into the pedestal left rear to accept the sear 
&gt;bottom bar- slipped right in.  Thus it could be lifted up to store stuff 
&gt;underneath.
