I'm not sure I buy the &quot;damage to pipes&quot; argument on a bus.  On a race car, 
sure.  At full throttle, lightweight headers can glow red hot.  Contain 
that heat with header wrap, and yeah I could see it damaging the 
pipes.  I'm not sure that the thick bus exhaust pipes would ever get that 
hot.  I'm definately going to wrap my heater pipes  and junction boxes with 
the stuff, and I will probably wrap my heater boxes too.  As for the pipes, 
I don't think there would be a significant benefit so I probably won't do 
it, but it's not because I'm afraid of damaging them.  I'm more concerned 
with water getting under the wrap and rusting the heater boxes.  Hopefully 
it will evaporate fast enough that it won't be a problem.

Next time I get a decent set of heater boxes (the 3-year-old Dansk boxes I 
have now don't qualify) I am going to ceramic-coat the outsides and put an 
end to rust and heat loss once and for all.  It's expensive, but you only 
have to pay for it once.
