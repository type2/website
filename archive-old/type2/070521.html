Subject: Bus won't start
To: type2_at_bigkitty.azaccess_dot_com (IPM Return Requested)
Message-Id: &lt;&quot;981204144747Z.WT27138.  0*/PN=Brian.S.Hoare/OU=C367320/OU=SLLN/O=McDonnell Douglas/PRMD=MDC/ADMD=TELEMAIL/C=US/&quot;_at_MHS&gt;

My bus wouldn't start this morning. I turned the key,
the warning lights came on, then it cranked over 5-6
times without starting. I gave it a 2 second rest by
turning the ignition key to off, then I turned back to
start, and nothing, not a sound, no warning lights,
no lights, no radio etc. This is my '67 bus (pretend it
is a '68 for the sake of this list). I checked my underdash
fuses, and each one looked good (visually), and I
measured my battery voltage (12.5), so why no juice
up front? 

It was cold and wet at 5 am, so I didn't crawl underneath
to have a look at the starter wiring. 

Any suggestions?
