My 72 has this same problem.  Every so often, nothing happens when I try to
start my bus.  I thought it was the famous hot start problem, but it's been
doing it this winter also.  Sometimes wiggling the wires under the dash seems
to do the trick.  Other times I just keep holding the ignition on for a few
seconds and the starter magically begins to turn.  A few months ago it acted up
on me one night.  Out of frustration I bent down to look under the dash knowing
full well I wouldn't be able to see anything in the dark.  I was wrong.  The
clear plastic wire connector that a bunch of the ignition wires run through had
a slight glow (like an LED) when the ignition was in the on position.  Upon
close inspection I discovered that the clear connector was worn and two of the
wires were shorting across ever so slightly.

I fixed the short, but I still have the intermittent non starting problem.

It wouldn't hurt to turn the ignition on and wiggle the wires around one
night.  You never know what you might find.
