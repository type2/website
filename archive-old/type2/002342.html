Joseph and list:

May I suggest that you consider a switch to the Pertronics (spelling?)
points replacement?  I was always fiddling with my points until about a year
ago when I installed one.  A Great Leap Forward in technology;  and having a
set of points and condensor in the tool kit gives you that &quot;belt and
suspenders&quot; feeling should the unit fail.

Usual disclaimers, blah, blah, blah.... 8^)


FWIW.

Good luck.

&gt; Thanks to about a half dozen respondents who agreed with my mechanic's
&gt; diagnosis -- I replaced the points (burnt) and condenser and everything
&gt; seems OK so far after short test drive.  I'll drive it to work tomorrow
&gt; and if no problems I think it's licked.
&gt;
&gt; Other suggestions included coil, dizzy advance, worn dizzy, plug wires,
&gt; and fuel pump.
&gt;
&gt; I should listen to my unconscious, which output the word &quot;condenser&quot; when
&gt; this first started happening.  This is elementary auto-shop-class
&gt; stuff.  But it's probably been 20 years since I last had a condenser crap
&gt; out.
&gt;
&gt; If all goes well, I'll pick up a spare set on the way home.  BTW this was
&gt; a relatively new set, on the otherwise fine SVDA dizzy I got from
&gt; aircooled_dot_net a month or so ago.
&gt;
&gt; And I'll be watching that coil....
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again, folks!
