Subject: [T2] Fuel line

Started smelling fuel around the Ghia, not worried as I had replaced all the
rear fuel lines with the new engine 14 months ago and replaced the line
under the tank this spring. I found 1 section soaking wet and assumed the
clamp was loose. Not to be, the entire length of (GOOD?) cloth covered hose
was soft to the touch and oozing fuel. Checking it after replacement, I
found the rubber hose cracked and crazing and far inside as I could see.
CHECK YOUR FUEL LINES, THIS WAS JUST A LITTLE OVER A YEAR OLD!

Bus content, lost # 2 on the 2 liter, 10 psi compression, oil made no
difference. Will pull it tomorrow or Tues to find the cause.
