&gt; I'm thinking that because the water is more efficient at soaking up heat,
&gt; you could have a smaller cooler near the engine where there is room for it,
&gt; and where the oil doesn't have to travel far, and then the  water
&gt; circulation could go through big 3/4 or 1 inch tubes pumped by an
&gt; inexpensive bilge pump, basically eliminating any flow restrictions.
&gt; You could control the temperature either by putting a mechanical thermostat
&gt; in the oil line, as is done with a normal oil cooler, and/or by  putting a
&gt; thermostatic switch on the water circulation pump.  Simple!

I don't think a bilge pump would pump enough water to make this feasible.

But if you insist on converting an aircooled VW into a watercooled one, how
about scrounging yourself a dual-belt fan pulley off a smog-pumped Bus,
buying a water pump for an American car (a FLAPS advertising circular lists
them as &quot;starting at $16.98&quot;) and using that to run the water system?
