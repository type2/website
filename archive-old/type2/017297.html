      Well, after 1120 miles on my new rear 225/75R15 tires, I've got
one real definite thing to say --- DON&quot;T!
Not in less you've got a lot more power than my 2.0L w/FI engine. Or a
lower final drive ratio. My tranny, with a 4.86 ring and pinion, and a
.81 (or maybe it's .82) 4th, just won't pull those big tires. Bummer!
        My '73 westy, with the above running gear and stock 185/75 -14
wheels and tires, would cruise at 75 all day long, and could easily hit
85 on the flats with no headwind. With the new tires, however, I was
cruising at 65 most of the time, had real trouble getting to 70 most of
the way from Mobile, AL to WI. It was just a real PITA in the mountains.
I was often downshifting into 3rd at 50-55. Now, there was a bad
headwind most of the way, and at times on even slight inclines I found I
could go as fast in 3rd as in 4th, and pretty much had to drive with the
pedal to the metal the whole trip. Needless to say, my gas milage sucked
-- which was one of the main things I thought the bigger tires would
improve.
         Things did improve when I hit Chicago, and apparantly got out
of the headwind, because from that point on I was able to cruise at my
accustomed 75mph and even hit 80 once in awhile. But hills were still
killers.
       So --- now I've just blown $150 bucks on tires I'll have to sell
at a loss. I'm not making the return trip like that. My fronts are
205/70R15's, but I'm wondering if even they are too big.  I want to
stick with 225-15's for the rear, but in a 60 or 65 series. I'll put he
205s from the front on first and see how they do, the overall height
would be just about like 225/65's.
