Subject: 12V ---&gt; 1.5V?

Volks,

I just picked up an indoor/outdoor digital temperature gauge from Radio
Shack - great deal at 10 bucks on sale... it even has a light!  I'd like to
run this 1.5 volt device from the car battery if possible, but I can't
remember how to do this.  Is it as simple as using V=IR to find an
appropriate size resistor to put inline with the circuit?  I don't think I
have to worry about heat buildup or power loss in this application, since
the current used is miniscule in this application.  I just want something
that will work.

I also picked up two 12V LED's to light another digital thermometer.  I
bought this dual-display unit (hehehe, he said &quot;unit&quot;) from Radio Shack
last year but it doesn't have a light.  The only color they had was red -
should look great at night!

When I get done, I hope to have indoor and outdoor backlit temperature
displays in the dash, and a third backlit display (the new one) to show
temperature inside the fridge, which I have found to be VERY useful.  I
want them all to run on 12V so I don't have to mess with changing the
batteries, and I want them to light up with the rest of the gauges at
night.   Yeah, I want it all - so sue me.  :)

- -David
