Subject: Utilizing all available storage space.

I reassembled my engine yesterday after a head and ring replacement.  It looks
great thanks to all of the hours spend cleaning.  It was worth it!!!  I would
have had it in the bus last night but my helpers didn't show up..  I can't w
ait to get this sucker going, it has been off the road since Dec 19.  Noone 
will recognize it.  
I want to thank everyone who got me this far and put up with my questions.  I
will give a better thank you when I here it run!!!
Now to my questions.  I am wondering what spare parts everyone carries with 
them in there buses at all times?  How about on long trips?  Where do you keep
this stuff?  I want to store everything out of the way so I can use the back
of my '77 westy for its intended purpose, camping?
Finally, has anyone found a way of utilizing the &quot;battery tray&quot; area on the
left hand side of the engine compartment (without blocking airflow of course).
It seem like this space could be used to store something?
Thanks for entertaining my questions once again,
Brett
