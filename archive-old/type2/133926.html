Subject: Re: [T2] sleeping in a Bay Bus

Is it primarily the foam and layout, or does covering have much to do with it?

I have a 73 with orange gunny-sack style fabric and on our first (in 6
years! Whoohoo!!) camping trip last weekend my noticabley pregnant
wife said she was surprisingly comfortable sleeping in a (fluffy)
sleeping bag on the fold-down seats.  3 yr old happy in hammock, 5
year old on campmobile plywood and foam pop-up slept soundly till the
lighting &amp; thunder rolled in...then we moved the small part down below
and he liked his &quot;surf  board bed.&quot;  1 yr old cozy beside us on
fold-down. :-)  (Little bit of rain came through. 1'' gap in rear-door
seal might be the culprit. Patch suggestions welcome.)

Also, I noticed the hammocks were on sale ($50?) at bus-depot when
looking for a slide-over seat cover for our badly ripped passenger
seat.

p.s. I never realized the beauty of the big opening via sliding door
in a camping shelter until camping with the bus. :-)  Surprised I
haven't seen more patio door like openings in RV's.  Leveraging Greg
Potts advice and left sink cabinet at home also helped.
