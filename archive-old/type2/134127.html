I have a couple of these on my camper - purchased about three years ago
in Europe. Good tire, great value. I bought them because they were the
second cheapest option to Korean made Marshalls (aka Kumho). Mine have a
100/102 load rating - plenty for a bay. They were around 40 Euros each
back then.

Meg, I just noticed your MD email address. I am in College Park if you
want to check out the tires on my camper.
