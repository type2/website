Subject: Re: CB advice (non-VW)

I used my mounted CB in the Van and my buddy used a hand held on a 
road trip caravan last month. The hand held did great when he was within 
sight of my van, any further and his signal broke up. However he 
could receive me when he lagged far behind.  Since my SO and I take 
separate vehicles occasionally, I ordered a Uniden handheld 40 
channel with car power plug for $40 from Damark. A mag. mount antenna 
from radio shack will probably increase the range.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Can any CB-ers out there advise me on the relative merits

&gt; &gt;&gt; I just want 2 cheap second hand ones for occasional use
&gt; &gt;&gt; in our 2 buses. Is there anything I should know? (I know
&gt; &gt;&gt; nothing).

&gt; &gt;Actually, I'd be interested in this as well. Having a CB would have made
&gt; &gt;multi-bus traveling a lot more pleasant, so I'm planning on getting one one
&gt; &gt;day.
&gt; 
&gt;         I don't know much, but I can say with athority that the hand-held
&gt; variety are a real pain in the butt. That's what I used for the Inuvik run,
&gt; and it worked, but not too well. Reception and transmission problems went
