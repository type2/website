Baby needs a new trailer and some chacos...

USED:

The original solex (I think) carbs from my '72.  Replaced 'em with
webers about 5 years ago, been sitting in a box ever since.  All
linkage, oil bath, etc...  I pulled a few rubber elbows from the mess,
but that's all, should be complete:

I have no idea what these are worth...  Make an offer.


Swing table from my '79, all hardware included.  I find it just to be in
the way with my config, may as well let it go.  Excellent condition. 
Make an offer.
