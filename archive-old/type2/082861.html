Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarket Tents

&gt; I see all this stuff on side mounted tents, and I keep thinking.........
&gt; Once the tent is set up, you are stuck to it.
&gt;
&gt; A separate tent allows you to stash your stuff in a bit more security than
&gt; just setting things outside on the picnic table, and you can drive away and
&gt; return later.
&gt;

I think all of the new bus tents Ive seen are of the drive away type. so
you could attach or not attach or attach and reattach. all is possible
within the force.
