Does anyone have an url for photos of a stock 71 engine on a stand from 
various viewing angles?  I'd like some good reference points to compare when 
I remove my engine to add my doghouse/dp firewall tin.  Since it's coming 
out, I might as well make sure it's totally right before I put it back in, 
yes?  =)  Wish me luck, it's my first time.

If my fan turns out to be wrong too, what size is supposed to be in a 
doghouse shroud?  Are there just two possibilities?  I have an alternator so 
is the backing plate supposed to be concave or convex?  My pulleys line up 
so I guess my backing plate is correct.  Thanks,

John
