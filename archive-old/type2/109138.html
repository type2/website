Subject: RE: [T2] compression #'s to good to be true?

&gt; I adjusted my hydraulic valves yesterday to Bentley spec at 2 
&gt; turns in, so today I decided to check the compression since 
&gt; it hasnt been done since I bought the bus almost a year ago. 
&gt; The test was done with the engine warm and with WOT. Well, I 
&gt; got quite the surprise. The measurements were: #1-135 #2-140 
&gt; #3-140 #4-140 
&gt; Are these numbers to good to be true?


I don't see any reason to think so. Could just be a nice strong engine,
combined perhaps with a gauge that is reading a bit on the high side.
The readings can vary depending on the particular gauge, temperature,
cranks, etc. Perhaps more importantly, the compression is relatively
even in all four cylinders. This is a good sign of a strong engine.
Personally I'd even take an engine with, say, 100 on all four sides,
over one with 130 in 3 cylinders and 95 in the fourth.
