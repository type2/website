John, you would not want the O2 sensor feeding off just one side anyway, in
that stock CA setup it is in fact after the merging of all 4 cylinders
immediately prior to the cat.  Your best bet, nix the left side stuff (BTW
Steve D. our esteemed listmaster would gladly take the remains off your
hands) then go with the 49 state left side box and a merged collector system
likesay the RMMW 938-734.  You would want to buy a weld on bung for the O2
sensor (a lot of performance places sell them for adding on O2 sensors to
tune carbs, it seems to me that Berg used to have them for about $10) and
have it welded to the point there after the tubes merge, or alternatively
into the short stub on the muffler.  But...  this puts the O2 sensor pretty
far downstream and it would be sensible to spring for a generic 3 wire
heated sensor on replacement (Bus Depot or whoever) and run the heating
wires off something that is on with the FI, like the fuel pump lead (comes
to mind, might look at where it is fed on the wasserboxer diagram) there at
the double relay or something of the like.  Having the heated sensor will
only be a benefit regarless, and they are only about $10 more than a
nonheated.

Of course all of this is strictly illegal even if sensible.  Steve and I
have been discussing the cat location on the CA model and I really don't
care for it.  He is hell bent on leaving it as is on the big MS Stage 2
motor but the idea of a 700F or whatever furnace sitting directly under the
left side pushrod tubes and barrels doesn't seem to me one of VW's best
engineering triumphs, particularly as there is no real reason for it, the 49
state stuff was cat and EGR equiped, they must have just had a ton of those
heater boxes (same as '79 CA bus??) to unload.  On Steves we intend at least
a reflective aluminum shield above the cat.
