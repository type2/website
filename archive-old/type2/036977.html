&gt;The other two just turn, turn, turn. Is
&gt;there a nut welded inside the frame that has broken loose? How do you
&gt;suggest I get these bolts out? Any help for this amateur mechanic would be
&gt;much appreciated.

Jeff,
I hate to break it to you, but this is indeed a nut welded to the frame, and it
probably has broken loose. My bracket got knocked off my 70 a few years ago by a
cop car in a hurry to get out of the parking lot.

I got the bolt out using a hacksaw to cut the bolt. Then, I took it into the
body shop to have the small section of frame that hold the nut cut out, rewelded
the nut, then reweld the frame back into place.

Best of luck, this was not an enjoyable experience.

-Peter
