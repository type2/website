Justin Condon sends:

&gt; I just spoke with someone that said that some engines take the o-ring, and
&gt; some take a paper gasket with four holes in it.

The paper gasket goes over the dowel pins on the end of the crankshaft.
(There's also a metal gasket with four holes in the seal kit--some engines
use it instead of the paper one.) The o-ring goes into a machined recess in
the flywheel.
