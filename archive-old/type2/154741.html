Subject: Z bed won't fold, then it wouldn't unfold

Last weekend while camping our Z bed didn't want to go back to being a seat when we were breaking down to go home.

I tried poking around with my finger to see if I could get something unhooked in the hinge, it suddenly released and went into a seat.

I forgot about it.

This weekend we went to turn it into a bed and it was stuck as a seat.

When you push the back down the bottom lifts up stuck in the angle that it is in while made into a seat.

Can somebody please tell me what is wrong and how to fix it.

Thank you,

James in Portland, Oregon that still can't get his new tire cover to fit
