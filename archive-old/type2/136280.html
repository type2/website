Subject: Re: [T2] Sun Super Tach II Question

Stan..
I have the same tach. with 4 wires coming out the back
red=switched power, black=ground, green=coil, blue=lights
 
As for which is connected to which terminal on the back, I'd have to take it out to find out for sure but it should be pretty easy to find.
I would assume &quot;G&quot; is the black/ground.  use a tester hooked up to a hot wire and probe the other 3.  The one that lights up the tester should be the Red/switched power wire.  To find out which of the remaining 2 pluhs is lights or tach, just test them both individually with a hot wire-the one that lights up the tach.would be the lights.  The last would be the coil!  Hope this helps?

I have been able to obtain a Sun Super Tach II for very little cash ($2 
new in the box) but !!!!! there are no instructions for installation and 
the wires coming out of the back are missing. I have searched the web 
and the archives and there's lots of &quot;Hook up the blue wire to..... and 
the red wire to .....&quot;etc but I have no wires. Just 4 plugs deep 
inside the back labelled &quot;T&quot; (on the top) &quot;L&quot; on the right (passenger) 
side, &quot;B&quot; on the left (drivers) side and &quot;G&quot; on the bottom. Has anyone 
access to one of these ($75) babies and can tell me what plug does what?
