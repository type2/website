Subject: Re: [T2] white stag tent still in biz?

ooph. so close, does this mean i'll have to hold it up myself? seriously,
i think i'm in a good place with 90% there. the four cross poles are fine
- two i can have straightened by my electrician bud with the conduit
bender. all i need is four elbow corners and the roofline &quot;straights&quot;
running parallel to the bus. can any white stag tent owners tell me: is
there a perpendicular rod across the top middle keeping the two main
pillars apart? not seen on the tent-site. also - are the roofline
&quot;straights&quot; one piece, or two each with their own connectors inbetween
...how's that work? TIA      - steve

&gt; Nope. Fred Stoermer researched this a couple years ago.  White Stag was
&gt; bought by a large conglomerate and currently produces clothing in North
&gt; Carolina. No tents, no patterns, no poles and no knowledge of the tent
&gt; manufacturing history.  It took about six months of e-mails and phone
&gt; calls, but White Stag, the tent maker is no more.
