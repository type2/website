&gt;I believe that we sell trailer hitches for all buses 72 and up...
&gt;I send you a part number and price next time I go into work...

Brian,
Please post to the list when you find out; There's a lot of interest right now.
BTW, don't forget that a hitch that fits a '73 won't necessarily fit a '72,
especially if it's attached to the bumper.
TIA!
