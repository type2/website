Subject: Re: [T2] drilling for thermostat mounting stud

Paul,

I have done it.  Didn't realize it *wasn't* there while I rebuilt the
engine.

I made a &quot;guide/template&quot; for mine out of 1/4&quot; aluminum flat plate
and then set it up off of an old engine after I checked to make sure that 
the boss was still on the inside of the block half.

My biggest fear was drilling it crooked or drilling too deep since I 
couldn't put it in a drill press....mostly crooked though as it is a 
little hard to get to.

Go slow and careful and keep that drill straight!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Type2 Folks,
&gt;     I have a new 1600 engine to put into our '71 westy.  There is no
&gt; hole drilled for the stud to mount the thermostat.  While I feel I'm
&gt; proficient enough at drilling and tapping holes to do the job, it
&gt; can't hurt to gather info before hand.  I'm wondering if anyone has
&gt; ever done this to a fully assembled engine and if so are there any
&gt; hints or tips to make sure I get it right?
&gt;     The engine is not in the bus yet and will be up on a workbench at
&gt; a good height to work on.  I've got some good sharp drill bits and an
&gt; 8 x 1.25 mm tap.  Anything special I should know before I center
&gt; punch, drill, and tap the hole?  This is in a brand new aluminum case
&gt; if that makes a difference.
