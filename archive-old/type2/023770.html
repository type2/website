Subject: Reducing wind noise?

Hi volks,
	    Does anyone have any thoughts on how to cut 
down wind noise in a baywindow? I have some sound 
insulation under the cab floor and over the engine bay
which cuts down on the engine and road noise levels 
quite effectively, however it's clear that the biggest
contributor to the noise level (at highway speeds)
is now wind. I'm guessing the most likely candidates
for attention are the gutters and the wing mirrors.

 Any ideas welcome.

Cheers,
	 W.
