&gt;I know this has been hashed, rehashed and hashed again, but it seems we've
&gt;never really gotten the definitive answer - i don't even think VW can answer
&gt;it, or maybe they just won't.
&gt;
&gt;The big valve seat dropping fear applies mainly to type4 heads.  It
happens to
&gt;type1 or 'upright' or 'beetle' engines, but not nearly as often or soon, from
&gt;what i hear.
&gt;
&gt;Only reason i can think is that the type4 engines are bigger and if 

poorly
&gt;maintained,

The foundation of the problem, compromise of the DM.


&gt;
&gt;The type4 head is a complete redesign of the type1 head.  There may be
&gt;something inherent in the design of the head that causes this early failure,
&gt;but i have no idea what it could be.  Anyone? 

You had the answer above. Failure to periodically adjust the valves was
the biggest problem the Type I had in becoming established in America.
 
&gt;
&gt;Also, maybe this is one reason VW no longer manufactures the type4 but is
&gt;still producing uprights?
&gt;
&gt;Hope this doesn't make you more paranoid that your type4 is going to fly into
&gt;bits one day while doing 70mph beside a big tractor trailer.
&gt;Sorry - that *probably* won't happen. ;]

That depends on the level of compromise of the DM.


&gt;
&gt;Reader's digest condensed question to list: 
&gt;
&gt;Why do type4 heads drop seats sooner?

How 'bout it listees? Can we have a straw poll of empirative evidence???
If you have suffered a Type IV valve seat problem, give us a quick outline
of service history, milage, experience, etc. Check the Bentley. Does it show
a procedure for valve seat replacement??? I think not. It doesn't mean you
can't experiment and try another method. How many have had cracks welded and
seats replaced???? How long did the fix last???? The machinist who did the 
work. Was he considered a masterful craftman by community report??? 
Was an annealing oven involed??? Just a solid journeyman??? Knew those Chevy 
heads gooder than anybody around BUT???

Include a report please if you have owned same and NEVER had such problems.
Tell us about your service history, milage, experience.
