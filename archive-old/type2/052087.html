&gt;Hey Everyone,
&gt;I found these parts on my stash the other day.  They were in a NOS box 
&gt;with the part number 211 035 657 A  and the word &quot;ENTSTORSATZ&quot;.  I figured 
&gt;there were type2 parts inside.  I look inside to find two black boxes, 
&gt;some kind of electrical items I've never seen before.  They are both 
&gt;unused.  The part numbers are 311 955 203  and 111 035 267 A  Here's a 
&gt;little description:
&gt;
&gt;1st part
&gt;  about 1.5 in X 1.5in X .5 in box with a green wire and a red wire coming 
&gt; out of it also has the words &quot;zum Storer&quot; printed on the side.
&gt;
&gt;2nd part
&gt;smaller box with just one single black wire. Has &quot;0,47uF/100V&quot; printed on it.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone have an idea as to what these things are?  I figured they might be 
&gt;for a type 1 or 3 VW's from the part number?  I can send a picture to you 
&gt;(not the list) if you need it.

Hi Aaron,
There have been a couple of answers to your post that I have seen, but 
maybe this will be a bit more accurate of an answer to the query.

The item is a tuneable L-C filter assembly consisting of an inductor (L, 
coil) and a Capacitor (C, Condenser).

The filter is then tuned to deaden the noise (a whining sound) in the form 
of RF energy that is created by the generator brush contacts against the 
generator rotor.

Essentially, the unit does little for the ordinary guy, except to possibly 
filter out RF hash that might be created by the brushes on the generator, 
and keep the &quot;hash&quot; from being heard on a standard AM radio. With FM, 
because of frequency and reception processes, the benefits of installing 
this filter are almost nil.

The unit is tuned, by varying the electrical values of the components, so 
as to resonate the circuit to the frequency (or frequency multiple thereof 
- &quot;harmonic&quot;) of the generator hash, and once properly tuned, the generator 
created radio frequency (RF) noise is then shunted to ground. The tuning of 
the circuit is optimized by listening on the AM radio, and as the filter is 
resonated, the AM radio whine will slowly drop in value.

I would like to get my hands on one of yours, if this might be possible. It 
does offer some advantage to a guy like me that operates ham radio from 
their bus. The same advantages might be obtained for CB radio installations 
in busses.

I still had one of the circuits stashed back in my junk box, as well, and 
it is currently mounted on Casper.

Ignition noise.........
That is another matter, and this tuneable circuit does not aid in dampening 
the noise created by the ignition firing. That requires other attacks.

The filter will not aid in the dampening of ignition &quot;popping&quot;. That 
requires shielding of the spark plug wires, distributor shielding, high 
resistance spark plug wires, etc., etc.

You ask me how I know these things?
The answer is basically here:
