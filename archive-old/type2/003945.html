&gt; What year bus do you have?
&gt; I had a similar problem before working on mine (71 westy). The issue with
&gt; mine I think had at least partly to do with unspec wiring a PO had done,
but
&gt; it worked for at least a year after I bought it. Could be a relay going
bad.
&gt; Also could be a wire shorting out, or I suppose , when you turn on your
turn
&gt; signals, it is asking for more power than the circuit can hold (seems
like,
&gt; at least on mine, things aren't all on their unique circuits, but get
wired
&gt; through switches in the dash which then start to mingle switches - maybe
I'm
&gt; not understanding it right but thats what it seems - its all wired
&gt; according to spec though, so that is what I suspected - with the
additional
&gt; grounding of a wire (short circuit-ing) It was using more power, but not
&gt; enough to blow - when the extra load was being drawn - something goes out?
&gt; Any way, so much for theories...check your relays...
&gt; wink
