Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Stainless Stell/Steel bimetalic corrosion
  problems?

&gt;&gt;Does putting stainless steel parts on a Bus cause bi-metalic corrosion
&gt;&gt;problems?

&gt;(...) A local metal
&gt;worker suggested I use silicone sealant, if the surface area between the steel
&gt;tray and the remaining sheet metal was large, to adhear the new tray to the
&gt;old.   No welding and no drilling holes into the stainless steel tray...
&gt;  
&gt;
If this is true we shouldn't trust any kind of electrical isolation, in 
a few years most materials get conductive as they deteriorate and absorb 
humidity. Our buses are too precious and they already have this nasty 
tendency to rust away and we the guardian of old times must do 
everything we can to preserve them... If not for love then for money: 
just imagine how much a good 70's Type 2 will be worth in 10 or 20 years 
time
Are there not any chemical engineers on the list that can explain this 
issue to us?
