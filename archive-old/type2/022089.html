&gt;I got an E-mail from listee Jeff Martin, he had run across a old post from
&gt;Bob Hoover, in this message he stated in passing that the oil pumps from a

&gt;the t4 pumps are very expensive and the t1's are cheap. He said to use the

You do have to watch a bit.  A 3 bolt? high volume pump should work in either.
In fact the Bugpack 3034? is sold for the T4 or as an iron bodied (Melling
style)
pump for the T4 and the T1.   BUT...

Pelican Parts of Porsche supply notes the pump does not ALWAYS fit perfectly.
Sometimes the drive tab is too long and needs ground a bit so that the oil
pump
doesn't load up the cam thrust bearings.  Easy enough to realize if you are
building
the engine as you just lay the cam in and the pump and look, but not so
apparent
when you are just putting in a new pump if you had some reason to do so.  They
have pictures at pelicanparts_dot_com or something like that.

I'd always measure carefully the length to the end of the drive tab from
the case
seating surface compare it to a T4 then install.

Something else I pmailed to someone, the pump is not a particularly great idea
being iron cased anyway.  After a few years they leak, and they can set up
galvanic corrosion, iron and aluminum don't mix expansion wise or electric
potential wise.  I've used it, but this time am actually just figuring
using an OEM
manufacturer high volume (30mm gear) T1 pump instead with a regular aluminum
housing and the lipped steel coverplate, exactly oddly enough what VW started
using on the Wasserboxer.  A bonus of any of these is that you can
&quot;blueprint&quot; the
gear to housing length by  carefully polishing it away on a piece of
wet/dry on
glass or something equally flat.  It amazed me that AVP, Stephens, and
others send
out rebuilds often with used T4 pumps which can not be logically rebuilt
due to the
complex way they are made when a high volume T1 pump is a whopping $40 or so.
