Subject: Re: [T2] insanity approaches!?!?

Had that kind of a noise on my 71 bus.....crack in head right next to
spark plug hole; not enough to wreck the compression reading, but you
could hear it at idle- pssst, psssst, !  I suppose a loose valve seat
coulod also leak a bit?

&gt; oh great and wise list......
&gt; 
&gt; I went out to my 78 2Liter (stock) auto tranny bus this afternoon to try
&gt; and track down a small engine miss....never found the miss I guess because
&gt; it is so intermittent, but found something else that has me totally
&gt; mystified.
&gt; 
&gt; #3  when cranked sounds like the valves aren't closing, you hear an air
&gt; rush when it compresses.  HOWEVER, the compression tester shows it right
&gt; on the money and within a lb or so of the other cyl....?  if the cyl leaks
&gt; how does it compress??   was unable to do a leakdown test, for unrelated
&gt; reasons.
&gt; 
&gt;   now the hsssst hsssst hsssst occurs on every crank when running  the
&gt; starter, (I know it is #3, remove the spark plug and it vanishes) but
&gt; engine starts right up, you can still hear it at idle, but once the RPM
&gt; gets up the sound goes away....
