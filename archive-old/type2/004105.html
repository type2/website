To everyone who asked me where I found the fuel filler neck for my '77
Westi, I have some bad news.
First,  thank you everyone for your replies to my message.
Second, the source I found was Go Westy, they had both leaded and unleaded
hoses listed on their web site. (www.gowesty_dot_com)
I just received a call from them and they have been sold out of them for the
past month and cannot find another source of them.  The listing for the
parts will be removed from their web site soon.
If I do find a source for them and have the actual part in my hand I will
tell everyone where to get them.
Sorry for getting everyone's hopes up (and mine too).

Thanks,
