Subject: RE: [T2] Finally available- locking gas caps for early bay
  buses

&gt; Chinese repops ... _at_ $105


Incredible!  If they're coming from China I'd be shocked if they cost more
than $10 to make.  Sounds like someone's trying to recoup their entire
tooling cost on the first 10 units sold.

Good thing you found one a bit cheaper on Ebay. I'd imagine you'd have to
live or work in a pretty scary section of town for the risk factor to
justify paying $105 to lock your gas cap. (Then again, with the price of gas
these days...)
