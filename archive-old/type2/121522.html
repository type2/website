Subject: Re: [T2] removing fridge

&gt;Someone told me that thier fridge didn't work and they took it out and 
&gt;turned it upside down for 24 hours and now it works. I think they said it 
&gt;moves the gases around.

A long, long time ago Karl told me that I should remove my fridge, remove 
the coils, and lay them in the summer sun. Apparently (if I remember this 
correctly) there is a mixture of paraffin and ammonia inside that sometimes 
turns into a sludge and will impair or impede circulation of the coils.

Also you need to make sure that your heater element is getting hot of course.

My fridge would get cold and then stop working. Like the mixture inside the 
tubes were circulating and then clogging up.

I plan to do this maintenance too and b/c it is winter I may find myself 
using a heat lamp, heat gun, or at a distance a propane torch careful not 
to melt the solder it is assembled with (I think).
