Subject: '80 Westy Fabric Gone! 

Hey folks,

Sorry, but the free Westy seat fabric didn't last long!  Had no idea it
would be such a popular item!  Hmmm... any bidders for the rug if we rip it
out?? :-)   In case you're considering doing the rear seats, it's quite easy
(says my wife) - and best of all, she is now also a stakeholder in our
newly-acquired '80 Westy!
