Subject: Re: '71 Rear Wheel Bearing

I did mine on my '73, not really that much of a hassle. Don't bother
with taking the housing off the springplate, just do it on the car. I
don't think the '71 is much different from the '73, and you don't need a
press to get the axle stub off or back in, just a nice oak block so you
don't bugger the threads when you pound it out. Go for it.
