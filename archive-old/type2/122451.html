&gt; I just obtained a pair of new pistons, which were part of a set of four.
&gt; The box has &quot;Kolbenschmidt AG&quot; printed all over it, and the following
&gt; numbers:
&gt; 
&gt; 029 198 075

This number is in the repair category and describes a 94mm piston kit for a
2L. The kit should include:

039 101 301C cylinder
022 107 111M piston
025 107 251  piston ring, upper
022 107 361D pisont ring, lower
022 107 351A oil scraper ring
022 107 411A piston pin
N 012 301 1  lock ring x 2

If complete I'd say each one was worth about $100 especially since they are
singles are folks with engine troubles and low on cash won't want to buy a
whole set.

&gt; The pistons are in their original wrappings and have never been used.
&gt; There's also an open set of seals, gaskets, and the odd widget (a metal disk
&gt; with 6 holes in it?) with the following text and numbers on the package:
&gt; 
&gt; 039 198 009
&gt; &quot;Reinz Vollsatz&quot;-Full Set-Pochette Complete
&gt; 01-23455-06
&gt; 914  2,0  2,0  LTR.100  PS  (73,5KW)  1972/

That is a Victor Reinz gasket set for a 2L 914. It's worth about $60.

The disk with the 6 holes goes between the flywheel bolts and the flywheel.
