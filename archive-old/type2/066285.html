Subject: Computer Art - bug

Sorry this is not heavily VW related, but I thought I would pass along
what my friend sent me.  I think he said this was a question on his
computer science exam.  Personally, it doesn't look like a bug to me, but
it is possible that it got slightly jumbled when sent to my mail system. 
This just proves that one can relate Volkswagens to anything.    

&gt;Thought you might enjoy seeing what they picked for the ASCII art in the
&gt;E-115 exam...
