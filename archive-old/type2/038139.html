Installed the new muffler, coil, rear tin and various connections to the coil,
carbs etc. Installed distributor with new tune up parts on it and new bosch
wires, installed the air cleaner which is a tight fit on the 1800 motor going
into a 72 with no upper
access panel. Checked the fuses and installed the battery. Then spent about 8
hours on the accelerator cable tube. I probably need a fresh tetnus shot, but I
managed to cut out about 4 bad spots in the tube - where the tube was solid rust
and a few old cables stuck in there. Strung the new 74 cable in there and it
does reach. attached the return spring and added two gallons of gas and tried to
start it. Turned the key and the idiot lights came right on , headlights,
interior and brake warning bulb all lit up like a christmas tree, as well as the
door buzzer believe it or not. the starter turned merrily over but no popping. I
looked at my fuel filters and they're still bone dry. I tighten the gas cable
and spring figuring I'm not pumping enough because of pedal travel, but I try
again and achieve the same results - nothing in the filters. So I spray some
thrust starting fluid down the carb necks and this time it pops a couple of
times then dies. Still no gas  from the tank. So assuming 2 gallons is
sufficient for ignition, I might be changing the fuel pump tonight. After all, I
went with the pump from the marsh.
