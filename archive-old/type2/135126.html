&gt; The all-season tire is one that I've been recommending on this list for
&gt; almost ten years now from personal experience (although I've never

&gt; It's made by a Korean firm called Hankook, who also happens to be an 
&gt; OEM
&gt; supplier to VW (as well as Ford).

This is terrific news, Ron!

This gets me to wondering who is the actual manufacturer of the Korean 
&quot;Capitol&quot; tires I purchased for my Westy earlier this year.  I have 
some info about them here:
