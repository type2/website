&gt;     I bought a 1977 Westy about a week ago.  Can
&gt; anyone tell me how to unhook the water pump thing that
&gt; is under the plastic water container?  I am cleaning
&gt; it out-it's really dirty and staining it, but I can't
&gt; get it off.  Does it unscrew, pull off, or...?  I
&gt; can't figure it out.  Thanks a lot.  I got a lot of
&gt; help from this list helping me buy this camper.  I
&gt; really appreciate all of the help you have given me.

It is a lot easier if you remove the wood panel first. Working thru that
hole is rough. Get a pair of pliers and gently pull the little plastic stops
out straight. They have a nail in each. Now gently walk the wood out of the
groove.
The 1st hose you see is the drain valve. It is easier to get to the pump if
you remove it first. Loosen the hose clamp at the base of the tank then
unscrew the fitting.
Now you can see the pump. Remove the hose coming off the side. Disconnect
the 2 wires. Loosen the hose clamp at the base of the tank. Unscrew the
pump.
