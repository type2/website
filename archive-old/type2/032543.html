Subject: RE: oil spewing on a 1600 

I had a similar problem on our 1970 Campmobile.  Everything pointed to a 
cracked case.  

Much to my relief it turned out to be a defective oil pressure sender.  Under 
operating pressure oil was leaking _through_ the sender unit.

We replaced four (4!!!) brand new senders before finding one that didn't leak.
