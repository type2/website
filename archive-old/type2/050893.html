Subject: [T2] front cot and side tent wanted - gee how original. :-)

I'm now on the hunt for these objects for my 79 Westy, how original I'm
sure. :-)
In any case, if anyone has them for sale at a decent price used, I'd be
interested, especially the side tent. 400US new is a bit too rich for a guy
with Canadian dollars to spend. :-)
Thanks,
Courtney
