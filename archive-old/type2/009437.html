I hate to do this, but I'm selling Samadhi. 

I was in an accident a six years ago in my old vw, a pretty serious one. For
a few years I couldn't drive due post tramautic stress syndrome, and since
then I've only been able to drive in a couple cars. I thought the bus would
be okay, but now that I'm actually *driving* her, as opposed to working on
her in the driveway, the panic attacks are happenining virtually every time
I get on the road. I've talked to my husband about it, and he agrees that
the easiest thing to do would be to sell her. I have a massive road trip to
Nevada coming up, and if I can't drive Samadhi then we have to get a camper
trailer for our other car. We don't have enough money or driveway space to
have both the trailer and the bus. The road trip is being planned with a
group of people, and I MUST be prepared. I can't sit around waiting to see
if the attacks go away. 

So, here goes:


'78 Westfalia Camper, avacodo green

new brakes (done last week)
two new cylinders  (done last week)
new clutch (done last week)
tune up (done a month ago)
two snow tires come with it
brand new tires, never even touched freeway
original back window panel (that mosquito net thing)


Needs-to-be-repaired stuff:

the sink unit is here, but it's in VERY bad shape. i took it out, and wasn't
going to put it back in. 
the seal around the poptop will probably need to be replaced soon, it's
original and coming apart.
the battery trays are rusty, but that's the only serious rust spot. 


I'm asking $4000, which will barely recover the costs of buying it and doing
all those repairs. 

If interested, or if you have any questions, contact me at
me_at_meandering_dot_org. We live in Seattle, Washington. 


Thanks to everyone that has helped me since we bought her in March. I got so
much out of the list.
