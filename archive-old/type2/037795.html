Jen,

The easiest thing I found to do was to get one of these jumpstart batteries. 
I bought mine for a little less the $100 a few years ago.  Its been a 
lifesaver -- not only for me, but for those stranded people I have helped.  
You can use it to power your accessories (I just attach it to the car power 
by using a double ended cig lighter plug. Both batteries will be utilized 
this way, so be careful.), or just use your regular battery and then 
jumpstart it when you're ready to drive off.  Works for me.  YMMV
