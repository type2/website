&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I have a wrap around
&gt; &gt;front bumper with the rubber-covered built-in step under the doors.
&gt; &gt;And my turn signals are mounted high on the front panel at either end
&gt; &gt;of the front air intake grill.  Is the article wrong or do I have a
&gt; &gt;diferent kinda bus or what?
&gt; 
&gt; We need to know what's in the engine room. Your three replies suggest that
&gt; the front end has been spliced or is an off 71. But AFAIK there are no 72s
&gt; with upright engines. The engine *could* have been spliced, too, but flat
&gt; engine + high front lights argues that your title is wrong as a matter of
&gt; Ockham's Razor.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a pedestal with an alternator on it? Is your pulley hanging right
&gt; out in the back with a belt up to the alternator?
&gt; 

Ok here is my 2 cents. About 6 months ago I called on an advertised
'72 bus. The guy I spoke with said it was an early '72 with an upright
engine. He said they did make *some* '72's with the upright, but not
too many. If this is true you may have one of these rarities......Chip
