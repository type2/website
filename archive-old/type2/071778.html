Well I succumbed to our common malady and bought the bench westy. Price was 
right and it was too solid to go to a junkyard or part out. Think it's a 
westy 'cause its got the so23 markings in the cab, someone correct me if I'm 
wrong. Dont think it's a converted panel 'cause it's got complete wagon 
windows. Things that make it special are the bench and small poptop, also 
came w/gas heater, now gone but duct is still there. Since it came from 
Oregon maybe it came from Canada originally? One other strange thing is it 
has a complete belly pan, I thought these only came on splits, too weird.
