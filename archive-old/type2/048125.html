Subject: [T2] VDO Extension Adaptor for '72?

I ordered a VDO oil pressure gauge and dual-Sender for my bus, '72 Westy
w/1700, from Bus Depot, haven't installed it yet.

But I'm wondering if I should have also ordered the:

  VDO Extension Adaptor for 360006 Oil Pressure Sender,
  needed for 84-91 Vanagon, helps with 73-83

Not sure if the guideline &quot;helps with 73-83&quot; is necessarily all inclusive?

Also are there any good sites on the web showing how to install a this gauge
and the oil temperature gauge for the mechanical challenged (moi)?


  thanks, Kevin

  '72 Popless Westy
