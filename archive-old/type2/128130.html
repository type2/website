Subject: where does this wire go?

check it out.
I just bought a 72 Westy. All stock. In the engine
compartment this wire is sitting near the battery
area. The ends are push-connectors joined to one
push-connector/splitter.
I cannot find a place for it to hook to.
I thought it might be a ground, but the ground tabs on
that side are occupied.

Looking at the factory wiring diagram made my eyes
crossed.
Do  the colors in the diagram match the wire colors in
the bus?

Anyone know where this should go? It's part of the
harness that comes through the firewall, visible in
the pic
