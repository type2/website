From what I remember about the tune-up instructions in the Muir book, he says to adjust your points for different octanes. The higher the octane, the slower the burn, I guess. Did you check your dwell?

Hmm. It makes we wonder if my bus would run better with higher octane gas, though. What do other listees use? (Please respond only if you have a strong feeling about it, otherwise the spam will flow.) Thanks!

&gt;how am I gonna do it (because I sure plan to be driving an aircooled VW in
&gt;the year 2000)?
