A pair of nylon tiedown straps with gutter hooks works very well.  Check the
archives for details, I've written about these several times...

HI Phil and everyone else too!
   &quot;Anyone else have &quot;fun&quot; driving their bus yesterday in the wind?&quot;

Well it was a couple of weeks ago that I had my fun in the wind.  I was
driving our '71 on a wide open road of 6 lanes in a wind of about 40 or 50
MPH.  With no warning I hear BANG!!!!!.  I go through the mental check list,
engine running, I still have control, wasn't hit by anyone, no red lights on
the dash, ..so I pull into a close by parking lot to have a look see.  I
walk around the bus and don't see anything hanging, no puddles or trail of
drips, engine is still idleing smooth as can be.  I decide to be on my way
and upon getting back into the bus notice the pop top is going up and down
as the wind changes speed.
   Turns out that the rubber hold down straps broke causing the loud BANG
that I heard.  I tied the roof down with some rope and turned onto some
narrow back streets to finish the trip home.  The wind couldn't build up the
same force on the narrow streets.  I've since replaced the rubber straps,
but sure would like to come up with something more posative to hold the top
down.
