Subject: Fwd:  Starting to get impatient

 Hi,
	I replied to some of the comments about pricing in another
mail, but realised I have something else to say:

 You ask specifically:

&gt;    If I were to buy a &quot;show quality bus&quot;, are 
&gt; they pretty much guaranteed to hold their value? 

 NO!   It will only hold it's value if you don't use it.

I'm assuming you're talking about a near-concours original
or restoration. The slightest ding, scratch, oil leak, crack,
or stonechip will reduce its value.

 If you want to be able to drive the bus you want something that's
sound but not pristine. If it's already a little scuffed the value 
won't be affected much when some bozo in an SUV dings your sliding
door in a car park. Watch out, though, for buses that are starting
to show a little rust in several places (under the windscreen, 
rocker panels, lower door edges, jacking points, sills). If rust
is starting to show up it will take a lot to stop it and if not
attended to the bus will very quickly become a shed.

Cheers,
	W.
