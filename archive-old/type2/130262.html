Subject: not another tire thread

I've finally decided to get some good tires for my bus.  The price for 
the Vanco-8's at Tirerack_dot_com has started to increase.  They were 
listed at $64 per tire yesterday and are now up to $66.  They have been 
listed on back order for several days.

Supply and demand!
