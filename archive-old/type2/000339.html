&gt; I've been reading all this on windshield installs, and quite frankly I'm
&gt; surprised. My wife (5'2&quot;, about 105 lbs.) and I installed the
&gt; windshield in my '76 in about 45 minutes. Very easy.


You were lucky. Replacing a windshield is sort of like replacing a poptop
canvas, in that sometimes you get it lined up just right the first time and
you're done, while other times it takes two or more attempts. The only
difference is that at least when installing a canvas you can't break it, so
if it takes you a few readjustments all you lose is a little time. With a
windshield, any reattempt is one more chance of cracking the windshield.
