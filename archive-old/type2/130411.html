Subject: Re: [T2] Hitch Question (Was: Driveway blues)

We built a hitch. Runs from the frame on each side of the engine (where the bumper bolts) and then had two steel runners to the front of the tranny. Also bolted to the bumper but not because it needed to. 

Would not move for ANYTHING... 

My test is bounce on the ball with your foot - all your weight. If it moves much then I won't use it. 

Chris
