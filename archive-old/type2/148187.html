Colorado Springs, huh? Kind of far.... Well, maybe I'd better think of
how to fix your bus instead ;-)

&gt; Good to go, right?  Wrong!  A test with the voltmeter between the positive
 battery terminal and the positive battery wire was 12 volts.  According to
 Josh, it should be zero.

Are we sure about that? Also, any accessory left on anywhere will
complete the circuit.... Sure nothing is left on?

&gt; The voltage regulator &amp; starter-solenoid are brand new.  The alternator I
 replaced less than 2000 miles ago and when I took it out I had it tested at
 the local Advance AP and it was all good

What about another free test at one of the auto parts stores? They put
the gadget on the vehicle as it runs.
