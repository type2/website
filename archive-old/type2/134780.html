Subject: Hanook Tires

Tire Folks,
&gt;
&gt; I bought these tires about 5,000 miles ago and have been very pleased. Saw
&gt; Hankook's advertsiement behind homeplate at an Astro's baseball game here
&gt; in
&gt; Houston last summer and I know Ron at Bus Depot mentioned them a few times
&gt; over the year.

Thanks Ron...
&gt;
&gt; I'd buy them all over again.
&gt;
