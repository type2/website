&gt;1.While I can do little stuff, like starter motors &amp;
&gt;the like, I don't trust myself or have the tools to do
&gt;an engine pull.
&gt;2.I live in the country &amp; don't have a paved or
&gt;concrete area I could carry out such a manouvre so I'm
&gt;forced to pay a mechanic to do it(which frankly is
&gt;safer although costlier).

Get with a bus friend who can pull an engine, and share / learn
the procedure. Use proper jack stands and jack, easily done
over a sheet of plywood or even on hard ground .
The tools required are minimal, you will be surprised to discover
you already have them ( a couple of wrenches, screwdriver and pliers ).
These engines are designed for many repair procedures to be
performed with the engine removed, and having this skill will give
you the freedom and confidence to do some of them.
