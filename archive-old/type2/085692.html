Subject: Re: [T2] please help


Richard,

Since I have been giving out the HELP SMOG number( 1-800-544-4357 ) I should 
give credit where it is due. The info came from a T2 post (Date: Wed, 14 Feb 
2001 09:45:09 -0700 From: &quot;Sean Garrett&quot;) to our list.

As to Texas smog its been too many years.  I do know they have a safety 
check (yearly?)that can uncover all those little items you are going to fix 
someday. Califorina has a check for incoming used cars where they look at 
the VIN numbers etc. They may look at horn, brake lights, stuff I don't know 
for sure.

Califorina used to have ~$300 or so charge for 76 and newer cars that were 
not up CAL standards. They were forced to refund that a few years ago. The 
idea seemed to be that they would accept the out of state lower standards 
but sombody had to pay (guess who).

There was a story in the T2 archives that said a 79 bus was going to be 
junked because of the lack of a correct filler neck. I take it that it was a 
CAL bus because if you paid a fee to get an out of state bus into CAL they 
could not fault you for not having  a CAL compliant bus.

Good Luck

Chuck

&gt;What a pain.
&gt;
&gt;I've got a Canadian model, that I'm about to import into TX.  It's been 
&gt;here
&gt;four years.  I drove it down and couldn't import it because VWOA gave me a
&gt;wrong letter to give to customs that said my van didn't comply with
&gt;emissions (US std. 1978 vs. Canada): spelt not worth the $thousands to have
&gt;a registered importer upgrade it.
&gt;
&gt;While I fought VWOA over the mistake to get the correct letter, my van sat
&gt;in the driveway and I lost interested in going through the whole importing
&gt;procedure (change speedo, etc).  In that time the gas tank turned into
&gt;sludge.
&gt;
&gt;I finally built up the courage to clean out the gas tank; the van is 
&gt;running
&gt;now and I'm about to change the speedo.
&gt;
&gt;My van is labelled non-catalyst so it's probably equivalent to a FED model
&gt;and I'm planning to move to CA later this year.  I was curious about your
&gt;experience with the smog police.
&gt;
&gt;I figure that if I tried to import the van directly into CA, I've have a
&gt;host of troubles because it's a FED model and is missing all extra items,
&gt;like filler neck restrictor.  I replaced the filler neck when I cleaned out
&gt;the gas tank because it was starting to tear and it was easier to get to
&gt;while the tank was out.

&gt; &gt; Here is the story. You can't pass CAL smog with a &quot;tampered&quot; fuel filler
&gt; &gt; neck. Now if you or the PO drive away from a pump without removing the 
&gt;fuel
&gt; &gt; nozzle the filler restrictor can be torn and fall under the &quot;tampered&quot;
&gt; &gt; category. This is a eyeball test. Heck technically they could fine you I
&gt; &gt; guess.
&gt; &gt; The restrictor is to keep you from using leaded gas and poisoning the 
&gt;CAT
&gt; &gt; converter ( required for my 77 bus but not required for FED 49 state 77
&gt; &gt; models).
&gt; &gt; My restrictor was torn and only the FED version was available at a
&gt; &gt; reasonable price ~$20. I was quoted $150 if they could find one at SMOG 
&gt;HELP
&gt; &gt; (1-800-544-4357 Darron I believe was his name).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I put in the FED version 211 201 199 I think the CAL version is 211 201
&gt; &gt; 199B. Replacing this part CAL or FED is not fun. The smog tech looked 
&gt;into
&gt; &gt; my filler and marked me down for a tampered fuel restrictor (FED 
&gt;version).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So here's what I did. I cut the hood off the damaged CAL filler neck, 
&gt;closed
&gt; &gt; the torn restrictor hole by tightening a wire tie around it (it looked
&gt; &gt; good). I left the opening lip attached to the trimmed and closed 
&gt;restrictor.
&gt; &gt; I removed the metal flange from the fuel opening, applied a coat of Vas 
&gt;to
&gt; &gt; the trimmed CAL neck and shoved it into the FED neck. I replaced the 
&gt;flange
&gt; &gt; (4 screws) and passed smog.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I warned you it was a long story.
