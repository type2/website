Subject: re: A question about heads. Anyone in Montreal?

Well I know of two places off-hand.  First I would recommend Techno Usinage
in Ile Bizard.  You should be able to get the number from the operator.
Also the second place I know of is VicWagen, which is down near Granby.
They should be able to give you a quote, and both are very experienced with
VWs.

If they're busy, perhaps they could give you a good referral to someone
else.

Good luck,
Shawn.
