Subject: RE: [T2] Strange distributor configuration

&gt;From: Mark Hineline

&gt;My distributor is the correct one for my bus (Bosch 231 168 005, VW 021 905 
&gt;205 P), but it is configured like no other bus distributor I have seen. 
&gt;Have a look:

&gt;http://www.ocotillofield_dot_net/distributor.jpg

&gt;The vacuum looks like it's on the wrong side of the case; it would point 
&gt;straight toward the bus installed this way. Is that right? Why is the 
&gt;vaccum can about 90 degree clockwise on every other distributor?


Is it your Vacuum can that is 90 off or is it your condensor?
