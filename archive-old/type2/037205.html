Subject: I have a '72 Westy folding cot for sale

I have a '72 Westy folding cot for sale. It spans the
roof opening, and is for 1 person. This item is black,
and cot fabric has been replaced with a nylon netting.
 I'm not sure of it's value, so if anyone is
interested, please let me know.  It weighs about 35
pounds.
