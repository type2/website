Subject: Re: [T2] 15&quot; wheels???

hey Richard,

i haven't been able to find anything like you describe, but the 
Mercedes wheels seem like a good direction to pursue.

also, the Yoko Y356C or D is a very reasonably priced 14&quot; stock tire 
available from tirerack_dot_com for about 50 bucks each.

are you going to put some neons on there also with the spinners? drive 
by the house when you get finished i want to check them out. ;-)
