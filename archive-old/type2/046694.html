Subject: [T2] Camping... and punkin chunkin!

Volks,

Well, it's like this...  I am going camping.  I don't exactly want to
arrange an &quot;official camping event&quot;, nothing that formal!  I just want to
announce that I will be camping and observing something that I personally
find fascinating...  If you find it facinating, then you are invited to
join me, if enough people decide to join, I will try to arange a group
area to camp :-)

The story is as follows:  In 1991, a guy by the name of Jim Paul and his
friend Harry got the idea of building a medieval siege engine.  Not only
did they do it, but Jim Paul wrote a book, entitled appropriately
&quot;CATAPULT: Harry and I Build a Siege Weapon.&quot;  Now, it sold pretty good.
Some of the people who bought it were inspired (and you thought that
rebuilding VW buses was nuts?!?!?!? :-)  As a result there is now an
annual competition in ancient siege weaponry in Delaware. Rather than
assault a real castle (popular in Europe, rare here in the US :-), they
attempt to lob pumpkins down range and measure the distance thrown. The
site for this silliness is at:

If this seems too silly to pass on, by all means write to me, let me know
you are coming! It will *not* be a VW camping event!  It will be an event
at which a number of VWs will be used for camping :-)  I do not know what
the camping facilities in the area are (the &quot;official&quot; campground seems a
bit pricy at $30/night!). If there is sufficient interest, I will be
looking into this, and will post when I know.

                           H Steven Dolan
