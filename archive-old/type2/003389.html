Subject: Hubcap Revival

Naval Jelly (or simular rust removing product) will temporarily remove most
surface rust.  You'll have to reapply as necessary.

The only permanent fix is to have them re-chromed.  Will probably cost you
10 times what the hubcaps are worth, but what the heck.  Check with the
nearest custom bike shop, or if you happen to see someone on a Ha*ley
Davi*on that's covered with chrome, ask him where he got it done.

Chrome paint will work, but doesn't look like chrome, and has to be
reapplied often.

Hope this helps.

&gt; &gt; My 1973 has the ORIGINAL chrome hubcaps. I know that replacing them is
inexpensive, but since they are the ORIGINAL ones, I want to keep them, (I
am sick that way).
