Subject: Re: [T2] MPG Westys

Depends on how you drive- on the 235,000 original 78 Westy motor, I was
getting about 17-18 (highway), but since I've toned it down to keep it
cooler and keep up the pressure
(about 20 when over 240 degr, about 25-30 at 215 deg- use 40 wt oil), I was
getting 24 mpg on the flats and 22 mpg driving to EB...but that's with
religiously keeping it to 50-55 mph!
