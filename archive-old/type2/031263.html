&gt; So i've been cranking and cranking until the battery goes dead 3 or 4 times

oil light stays on????  if the oil light stays on and you do that much
cranking then there is an oil pump/presure problem and the engine not
firing may have saved your engine,  oil presure light should go out after
a few seconds cranking
