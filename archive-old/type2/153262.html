Subject: [T2] Front axle beam

Hello all,

since my front axle beam was rusted through on several small spots, I
decided to get a new used one. I was lucky and got a complete '78 front
axle beam (arms, brake booster, brake calipers, rotors, ...) that had
been removed from a bus in 1984 and left in a dry place. It looks really
good, but I'm not sure what to check/replace/clean.

Also, I want to prepare the beam as best as I can to not start rusting
soon. What would you do?

Is the installation a pita or is it straightforward? Do you have any
suggestions, ideas or tips?

Is it true, that even if the front axle beam is for a t2b it may not fit
my bus, because they come in different widths?

Thanks in advance,

Timo
