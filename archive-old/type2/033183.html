Subject: Kinked Exhaust
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi All,

I have another problem of my own creation ;-)

I backed my bus up and bent my exhaust pipe on a good sized rock. I pulled it
out so it is pointing the right direction, but a kink remains which would
seem to obstruct the flow 50% or more. The part which is kinked is between the
muffler and the open air, perhaps 8 inches from the open end of the pipe.

I drove the bus 200 miles this weekend without any apparent problem. Is this
kink going to cause reduced power/mileage? Should I get it fixed right away?

My bus is a '78 2 liter.

Thanks in advance!
