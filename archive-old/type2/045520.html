Robert,

The noise your hearing is probably related to one or two things (if you have 
an upright engine):

1.  Generator (or alternator) bearing(s).
    take the belt off and spin the pulley - hear anything?
    try wobbling it from side to side - any play?

2.  Something in the fan.
    reach around the front (FIF) of the fan shroud (while the belt is off) 
and try to  feel for something like a rag, paper towel, wasp's nest, etc.


Hope this helps

PS      My engine seems to do fine at 4000 RPM
