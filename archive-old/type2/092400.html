Subject: mixture distributor pipe for dual carbs

Hey folks, I'm sorry to bother y'all with this, but I'm in need of a
mixture distributor pipe for a dual carb engine.  This is a metal pipe
about 1/2 inch in diameter that connects to the upper inside front (f i f)
part of the left hand carb, the left intake manifold, goes across the
engine under the air cleaner, and then connects to the right intake
manifold.  I'm also going to place an ad on thesamba_dot_com because I don't
think I'll have much luck finding this contraption.  does anyone who's
converted to dual webers or the like have one of these mixture pipes lying
around that they would like to sell to me?   many thanks, Greg
