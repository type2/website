in response to Garys side door problem, I had the same problem with my '70,
take my word for it , that middle latch will not budge! no matter how big the
hammer or chisel.. The '70 has two rods, I made sure that every bit of slack
was out of both rods.( Bently hints at it but dosn't go into detail) Voila
door popped open. hope yours is this simple, think it is ,I too had pulled out
my latch to exchange.
