Subject: Re: [T2] Detonation Help

&gt; Set the timing(with a timing light) to 7.5 _at_ 850 RPM,
&gt; If you run it very much with it pinking, you won't
&gt; have to worry about setting the timing you'll need a
&gt; new engine. Take care of it as soon as you can. Use
&gt; the timing specks in the bently, I'm not sure of
&gt; these. Phil

AND

Check teh total advance.
Check the specs for your dizzy, link in type2 library
