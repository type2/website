&gt;the motor is seized from sitting for long time.

&gt;I have been told that a mixture of diesel fuel and
&gt;penetrating oil....poured into the cylinders and into
&gt;crankcase will free the engine..???

I've used an oil can. The little ones you fill with a bit of oil that
have a squirt trigger. Remove spark plugs and squirt some oil in each
hole. Leave the plugs out and use a wrench on the alternator nut to
spin the engine round and round until it loosens up. Clean plugs and
put them back in. the engine will belch some oily smoke for awhile and
the plugs will need to be replaced at least once after that.

If it doesn't work or after a compression test you find a broken ring,
well, it's time to replace and/or hone P&amp;Cs and replace rings.
