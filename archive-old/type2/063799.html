You don't want to use anything besides the copper gasket.  If it is
leaking, I'd be willing to bet the gasket wasn't seated properly and got
pinched when you tightened it down.  I'd drop the heat exchanged on the
loud side of the bus and redo the copper gaskets.  Use something to hold
the gasket to the exhaust pipe so it won't move while you install it.  I
use anti-seize.
