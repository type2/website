Subject: Re: FW: [T2] Condensers [adr]

In your picture, are you identifying the black box as 211 035 257?
According to a ETKA parts search for that part # I get Suppression 
condenser for ignition coil &quot;deleted part. There is no replacement part. 
Deleted 8/91&quot;
I do not find that item in any wiring diagram for 68 thru 79.  If that 
is what the black item is, looks like it can be removed and just run a 
line to the condenser on the dist.
jimt

&gt; What was unusual was that instead of connecting the green wire directly 
&gt; to
&gt; the coil, it connected to a black box that is inline with terminal 1 on 
&gt; the
&gt; coil. 211 035 257.
