Subject: LED Replacements for Tail Lights

Has anyone ever tried those LED cluster bulb replacements for tail light bulbs?  They are supposed to be brighter and turn on faster.
Autozone has them for $16.00 a pair.  Are they worth it? The rear lights on my 71 could use more brightness.  Do you have to make any changes, other than the bulbs, to use them?
