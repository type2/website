Good one Seth---

And I just got back from my local  VW dealer, two blocks away---
They just don't seem to be carrying this model / style there.
Please direct me to my local North American distributor/ dealer for
these Bugs---

And close by too---I might need to have some warranty work done.

Oh--you say that there isn't any local dealer's in the US----
Awww--to bad--I had my heart set on another new antique---:&gt;)
 But I see that you conveniently live in Laredo--you could walk across
the river and buy one---I can't.

I had a feeling that some wild man would come up with this one----
I should have added a US stipulation on the message. 

Later,

Terry

and take a look at a brand new air-cooled VW.

Please tell me what automoblie is VW manufacturing in 2002 that is air
cooled? 
Hmm---maybe I'll have to down the street, and check out the lot at
VW--perhaps I missed a new model.
