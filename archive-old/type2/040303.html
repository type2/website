Subject: Qu on Detecting misfiring plugs

Quoth Rick Taylor
&gt;&gt; Always use Bosch plugs, Champions have an extra thread at the bottom and will carbon up, then when you take the plug out, the carbon in the thread can ruin the threads in the head.&lt;&lt;
 Now you tell me!  This happened to us on a bug motor once.
BTW,  1. using a strobe timing light that clips over the plug wire, will
it always not flash under either condition (shorting in cap vs shorting
in plug)- or will a shorted plug still flash the light since the current
is getting thru to ground but bypassing the gap???  If it still will
flash, how can you detect the shorting plug besides noting it's wet or
detecting that the cylinder is not doing its share?
2. What if plug is misfiring only at high rpms- any way to detect
this?????
