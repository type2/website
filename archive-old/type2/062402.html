Subject: Korean pull?????

As I begin readying my bus for daily driving, I have noticed
that I have negative rear camber. It is pretty significant and
I would like to get it fixed. However, my funds are limited and
I have heard this is quite expensive. I read on this list about
someone having a &quot;Korean pull&quot; done to fix their camber. My
question is &quot;is this the technical term for it?&quot; I would like 
to go to my body shop armed with at least the correct termonaology.
Thanks.......
