Subject: Re: [T2] another emissions question

I never took my bus through the CT inspection because it's over 25 years old.  As I recall, the dyno test takes less than one minute.  I doubt that your engine would overheat in that amount of time.  

In response to Bob's comment, CT is a lot different than CA.  CA has state licensed emission station &quot;boutiques&quot; that will try to sell you parts and services if they can.  CT is state operated.  You either pass or fail.  If you fail you get it repaired or get a waiver from an auto repair shop stating that the cost of repairs will exceed a state set amount.  Pretty cut and dry unlike CA.

&gt;After reading Bob's post about the fans not reaching the air intake I
&gt;have a question. I am going for  emission testing next week.
&gt;In Connecticut they put your car on rollers and take it up to about
&gt;35mph(not sure that real speed just a guess) with a probe in the tail
&gt;pipe. They have a fan mounted on a gate like setup they just swing out
&gt;in front of your car. If they test my vehicle on this set up
&gt;the fan will be useless for my bus? Should I not worry about it or could
&gt;this overheat my bus? Any CT listees been though this?
&gt;
