Subject: Re: [T2] cheap tools

Cheap tools are good to throw in the spare parts boix in the VW, but when
you twist them all day, the &quot;Paws&quot; begin to feel it...

IO have ATLEAST 50 K$ in tools of all kinds, and I will tell you that
nothing beats the grip of a snap on screwdriver, and nothing is easier on a
tired set of hands than a good feeling wrench...

Backyard mechs can get by with cheaper tools, but I have goofed up way more
bolts/nuts with ill fitting tools than any other reason..

My favorite tool is a factory supplied 17mm Box wrench from a Honda
Motorcycle..Nothing breaks bell bolts loose like this thing..I have had it
for near 20 years and use it everytime I pull/install an engine..

&gt; What Hoop said.
&gt;
&gt; I have an eclectic collection of tools gathered over the years.
&gt; Snap-on, Mac, Bonney, a few Craftsman, a few Harbor Freight. Most of the
&gt; former live in my tool box.  In the VWs there lives a small tackle box
&gt; with the tools necessary to emergency repair each of them.  Included in
&gt; that tackle box is a 17 piece HF Pittsburg Forge combination end wrench
&gt; set.  The quality of these wrenches is 80% of my Snap-ons.  The cost?
&gt; $19.95 for the set.  I buy them by the half dozen. If I loose a wrench
&gt; on the road, so what.  The set is cheaper than a 13mm Snap-on.
&gt;
&gt; Additionally in each box I carry 5&quot; genuine ViseGrips, a couple
&gt; screwdrivers, a plug socket with the correct extension(s) for that motor
&gt; and a decent (read Craftsman or swap meet Snap-on) ratchet. A 10mm 1/4
&gt; drive socket and ratchet completes the hard tools.  I also carry a $10
&gt; multimeter in the FI buses and a test light in the carb'd VWs. Total
&gt; expense for each tacklebox? Less that $50 new.
&gt;
&gt; For a timing light, I use an old non-inductive pickup Balkamp.  Metal
&gt; case and nearly indestructible. Cost $5 at the swap meet. I've owned
&gt; inductive pickup lights and they are waaaaay to fragile for me. This one
&gt; works. Though sometimes it'll knock you on your a$$.
&gt;
&gt; I also own a 3/4&quot; drive socket set that I paid the princely sum of $29
&gt; for twenty years ago.  Chinese, Indian, I don't remember... Some third
&gt; world country. The sockets have survived just fine behind my CP 3/4
&gt; drive impact. (850 lbs ft torque).
&gt;
&gt; On a budget?  Home use? Buy the mid priced Harbor Freight stuff. The
&gt; cheap stuff (40pc socket set _at_ $3.99) will ruin fasteners.  Their
&gt; Pittsburg Forge stuff is better than Craftsman. Buy the $20 wrench set,
&gt; the $30 socket set and a selection of their faux Craftsman screwdrivers
&gt; and they pay the shipping. Buy your multimeter and your timing light at
&gt; the local pawn/second-hand store.
&gt;
&gt; You'll have everything you need except the special &quot;use once&quot; tools* for
&gt; less than $75.
&gt;
&gt; * and I can tell you how to fake a few of those...
