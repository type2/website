&gt;The vacuum advance doesn't only work under the conditions you described. 

Actually it does for some models that have the vacuum advance cutoff enabled. See Bentley, Engine &amp; Clutch page 73.

Personally I think this device is bad for the engine. It was a short term emissions addition to make the engine run hot on purpose. Porsches of the same era were tuned/configured hot for the same reasons at the expense of a longer (now reduced) engine life.
