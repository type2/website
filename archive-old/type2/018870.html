Subject: Thoughts about a couple of AFM failure modes, developed from
studying a used digijet and new digifant AFM, reading the service note,
list messages, some archive search, personal experience, etc.
Conclusion: AFMs will wear out and fail in unpleasant ways. The capacitor
fix is dubious. Preventative measuring and  digitool monitoring the AFM
are very smart.  Should be replaced about every 90K miles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
AFM Description:  A laser trimmed resistor stick with eleven taps over
to a parallel thick film resistor.  Presumably the resistor stick is
trimmed to give a linear output voltage relative to air flow.  The wiper
has two contacts, presumably for better reliability since they're both
measuring the same voltage.  A voltage is put across the stick, and the
wiper which is hooked to the airflow gate senses the voltage on the film
resistor as it moves along it.  OK, this is all pretty obvious.

Also obvious is the most likely failure mode:  The thick film resistor is
worn by the contacts and the resistance between the contact and the
resistor climbs up to levels that can affect the ECM, due to a high source
impedance.  I actually measured this by checking the resistance from the
end of the stick to the moving wiper and watched it go up smoothly to
several thousand ohms, then take about a 10K ohm leap, then come back
down.  The 10K ohm leap was about one third of the way up the resistor and
seems about where the contact would be at cruising speed.  The obvious
repair is replace the AFM because the material is worn out.  I was able to
make the resistance well behaved by squirting with cleaner as some have
done, but a concern is that the base resistive material is still worn and
will soon fail in the same way. Bending the wiper to contact different
places on the film resistor, as one clever person did, would probably also
work for a while but the contact pressure is uncalibrated, maybe too much,
maybe too little. It seems these repairs may have questionable long term
reliability. The AFM wiper contact will deteriorate with usage over time.

The other failure mode of record is the alleged mysterious wiper vibrating
that usually takes place in cold weather after driving for about 30
minutes.  Volkswagon recommends the capacitor fix for it.  Frankly, this
whole wiper vibrating concept seems farfetched unless it's associated with
resistive wear indicated above. Averaging the signal with a capacitor
merely mitigates the problem somewhat, it doesn't get rid of it.  Seems
like it's new AFM time again.  Or is it?  The
AFM-caused-hesitation-after-30-minutes-of-cold-weather-driving MAY have
happened to my van at 15K miles, well before the resistive film should
have worn.  So this is still puzzling.   I have the capacitor but don't
feel that it helps much.

To the hyper-prevention types like I'm becoming, the most conservative
approach seems to be to treat AFM's as wear and throw out devices (keeping
a spare used one around) and they should be monitored as follows:

1) every 30K miles, measure the stick end to wiper resistance for
monotonic behavior, and when the behavior gets significantly non-linear,
replace the AFM. This is a much better measurement than looking at the
voltage at the wiper while moving the gate with the key on.

2) monitor the AFM on the digitool while driving, and if the AFM signal
starts bouncing around at a constant throttle setting, replace the AFM.
Seems like a simple way to address this known wearout device that causes
so much fear, uncertainty, and doubt, not to mention $150 for a wiring
harness of dubious merit.  Save the money and give it to Darrell Boehler
for a digitool with the capacitor included!  New AFM's cost about $100
from list vendors.

The old AFM can be kept as a spare for troubleshooting
with or without attempting to &quot;fix&quot; it (which is fun, by the way).

Other information or opinions about AFM pathology?  I'm really interested
in some credible theory about what really might cause wiper vibration.
