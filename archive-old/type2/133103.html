Subject: RE: [T2] mattress

Corbett,

No other coverings at all except for the cloth to protect the foam.
Actually, I suspect that was the hardest part as it is sometimes difficult 
to sew, and zippers are *not* cheap!

Lordy, it was a *good* sleep though!

Cheers, dave

&gt; That would be what I am looking for. I was hoping that someone 
would have some experience with this type of mattress. Did you 
cover the firm foam with anything a little softer, like a egg crate foam or anything like that?
