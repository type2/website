&gt; I'm all set to put in my new alternator. One question though. On my old

&gt; what about my pulley??

Hmmm, every generator and alternator I've seen has a half-moon key at each
end of the shaft.  I just took it out of one unit and put it into the
other.  I've a feeling that your &quot;male&quot; key is simply the half-moon key
stuck in the shaft.  Get a punch and give it a few taps and it should come
loose.
