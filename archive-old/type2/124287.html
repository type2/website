Subject: Re: [T2] SVDA question

Thanks John,

Appreciate the response. So the SVDA timing at full advance would be 30
degrees (same as the 009) and not 45 degrees as mentioned in a previous
post? (This would be on a stock '71 with 34 PICT carb.)

Bill



| Proper vacuum advance is only present from off-idle to 1/2 throttle. Above
| 1/2 throttle vacuum advance is 0 and you have centrifugal only, which is
the
| same as a 009. This is why a properly setup SVDA will outperform a 009 in
| ALL circumstances, because the worst it does is a 009 curve (1/2 to full
| throttle).
