&gt; &gt; I got mine at Bus Depot. $5.95 I think. It doesn't matter if it's auto or

&gt; oh yes, it is a very different cable, it connects to the tranny, and a
&gt; link runs from there to the accelerator.
&gt;    it is quite a bit shorter than any other accelerator cable, I have the
&gt; part # written in my Bentley, will get it out of the van tommorrow and
&gt; post it.
