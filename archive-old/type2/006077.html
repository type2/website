Indeed...

The &quot;rebuilder&quot; of my next to last engine [1600SP] was having fits getting
the mixture correct using his super zoomy analyzer to dial in the new
Brazilian 30/31 I'd provided.

Then I reached over and wiggled the carb, at which point all became clear
[to me, at least].  The front [F is F] mounting stud had no nut on it, and
the nut on the rear mounting stud wasn't even finger tight.

Surprise!!!

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Sounds like a vacuum leak.  Maybe at the carburetor itself.  &lt;&lt;
