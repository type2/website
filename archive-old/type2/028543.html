The axles do have to be removed to replace the boots, as George said.
However, it really isn't that bad of a job. It is pretty greasy though. Make
sure you have some sprayable solvent on hand and some toothpicks (or related
item) to clean out the bolt heads though. Mine were pretty gunked up with
grease, oil and dust. BTW, the list here is where I got the tip on cleaning
them out - after I almost stripped several bolts! Just watch your eyes -
obviously.

Peace,
