Subject: vanagon line drawings

Guys,

I need a reference for an EKTA like drawing of an 81 Vanagon engine.

Had a guy that was interesting in buying the engine out of my parts van, 
but wants to use it for a t4 conversion into a bug...aand I don't think
it's going to work because it doesn't have the right oil breather
tower on it.

pmail if you know anything about the t4 conversion stuff that
would help.

Thanks ,dave
