Subject: j-tubes or heat exchangers?
Content-Disposition: inline

Hello all...
  Quick question. Do J-tubes take the place of heat exchangers? If so, what is the advantage/disadvantage? I'm assuming the decision will drasticly affect the heating and/or cooling system of the bus. 

  I bought my bus w/out an engine, so I'll need an exhaust system. I did get the original  heat exchangers from the PO, but they don't look too hot. I would rather by new ones than take a chance on the old ones leaking and possibly killing a freshly installed engine!

Peace &amp; Harmony
