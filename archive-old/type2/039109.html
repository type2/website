When one cylinder goes, the whole system is contaminated. If the hoses are
old, they can swell shut and not allow the brake springs to pull the shoes
back. Are you using NAPA parts or OEM?

If you open the bleed valve and a bit of fluid squirts out and the shoes
release, it is probably the hoses. Replace them, and know the MC and front
brakes will have weaknesses founded on the same contamination as well. Put
it all right and flush the fluid yearly to prevent contamination from
occuring again.
