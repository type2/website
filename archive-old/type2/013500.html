Well folks, time to leave the land of endless sun and return to the frozen 
northland. Too much to do and see this week. Great to see how many 
listees showed up at OCTO, with as many were there we could almost 
have our own show. Good to see old friends and make new.

 Ran into Steve who between the two of us are proving how small the 
world is (I'll find you a copy of the tent diagram) Sampled Harry H's 
hospitality,if hes not carefull that first round thing will bankrupt him. Got 
a chance to meet the infamous NQ and his posse. Got to put my feet 
under Don B's table and could hardly stand up we were all so full. 
Learned that Nikki has indeed got the 69 back on its feet and heard 
from Rick the benefits of a brush hog. Plus a whole bunch of you I just 
got to meet and say hi to.

Made some great finds, a early Bently with color diagrams,and at the 
end of the classic that german engine stand finally got reasonable : ) 
and has a new home. Best of all while junkyarding yesterday, was 
standing there with toolbox in hand as they unloaded a 66 split. Going 
home with a perfect deluxe bumper,and misc other bits. What I could 
not seem to find was a bay sliding door or the bits, everyone was gone 
or broken, whats up with that?

Heading home this morning to pick up the 77 Riviera in Oregon, so if 
any of you up that way see a overloaded Astro pulling a white poptop 
give a wave. If I have any luck on time might even get a chance to meet 
Bill N and get him to buy a beer or two.

here's hopeing you all had safe trips home
Chuck
Vancouver Is.
