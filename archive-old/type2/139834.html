&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Wondering if the ECU's from late model busses can be interchanged
&gt; (i.e.-&gt; a '78 and '79)?

yes and no, there is a list in Bentley of the different ECU's and what
models they go with, but I have generally heard that the engines will
still run fine with the wrong ECU.  I ran a 1700 manual engine with a
2,000 auto ECU for at least a year without noticable difficulty
