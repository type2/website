&gt; Hi Corbett,
&gt;
&gt; The extractor exhaust sounds a bit more aggressive and improves 
&gt; performance slightly. If it lasts HALF as long as the stock style 
&gt; muffler you should count yourself lucky.

   Saw a really nice dune buggy over the weekend with a custom
exhaust system...Stainless pipes leading to chromed Cherry
Bomb glasspacks...The guy had them made up...$1,500 for the
set... 8-(
