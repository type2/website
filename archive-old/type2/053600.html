&gt; Thanks for the info about the servo everyone,
&gt;     I've been toying around with this for years and I think it's time to do 
&gt; it, Libba has a number of holes in her and I want to let some artists go wild 
&gt; at a festival I'll be at in a week......Does anyone know where to get DTM 
&gt; paint (Direct to metal) that I can mix up and make my own colors? Or is there 
&gt; another paint someone may recomend that is brushable? TIA
the BEST paint for painting a car artistically with a brush is One Shot
billboard enamel.  Grreat colors, perfect coverage. To prevent runs thin
very very slightly with lacquer thinner, this will cause it to dry very
quickly, though it isnt a perfect way to do it.  One shot is pretty
expensive paint because it has good pigments and a lot of em, anywhere
&gt;from $15-100 per gallon depending on the pigments used (buy quarts or
smaller though, it goes a long way..

One shot contains lead, do not use it indoors, or allow children to eat
your bus.

Short of that, use rust-oleum.  Colors not as bright, by a long shot, but
its cheep, and you can thin with a dab of lacquer thinner to cut out the
runs.

All of these are oil based paints, dont use latex, it wont stick well and
may peeel off in sheets.  Bring thinner and go-jo for cleanup. Get a
couple of decent brushes, call a painters supply shop (HA) for those,
or any good natural bristle cutting brush will do.

Take care,

Steve &quot;i used to paint billboards for a living&quot; white
