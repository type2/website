Help,
Where is the &quot;best&quot; location to put the power lead when timing the motor?
Using a Sunpro model CP 7504 timing light on my 82 air-cooled California
model Westy.

I've got my Westy all back together and you can't tell there was an engine
fire. :-) I could have not done this without the help of Karl von Salzen. He
has gone way out of his way to help me for nothing expected in return. He
has been a true blessing to me and my situation (owning a CA model Westy in
Montana). While others have tried to exploit my situation, Karl has shown me
the giving side of human nature which in this day and age is becoming very
rare as our society becomes more and more selfish. While words cannot
express my gratitude, THANK YOU KARL.

I hope she's gonna start. :-)
TIA
