Subject: Replacing the Cam
Content-Disposition: Inline

Hey all, i am sure this might have been covered on the list many times,
but i am fairly new around here, so if it has, i apologize. 
I just got the news yesterday that i might have a bad cam in the old
1600cc dual port. my mechanic has run his battery of tests, with a few
more to do, but as of yesterday, its either a bad cam, or hopefully, a
bad valve. I will know for sure today. But for the purpose of this
message, i am assuming its the worst, a bad cam. If its the valve, to me
thats a pretty easy fix, you see, i have yet to split a case for a
rebuild. this could very well be my first time. as far as the upper half
of the engine goes, its all pretty much new, new heads, fairly new
(6000miles) P&amp;C, new carb, new gen, new coil, new fuel pump, like i
said, top half is pretty much new. so now, if i indeed need a new cam,
first off, any recommendations as to which one to buy? also, in
replacing the cam, i know i need to split the case, have the new cam
handy, and a new seal kit for the engine, but what else besides all this
might i have to keep in mind for this rebuild? i mean, being that i am
in there, what else would you recommend i check into, or what other
parts might i want to have on hand while i am in there? i know its not
that easy to do this job, but i also know its not rocket science either,
i dont have a wide array of tools, but i have the basics, and a torque
wrench. so, is it as easy as..split the case, replace the cam..replace
seals and put back together? how about the oil pump? its been working
fine as far as i know..any other suggestions? Or might a person in this
situation be better off just buying a short block? i am not afraid of
doing this job, but i just want to drive the bus around so bad, it
hurts!  if you have a few minutes to help me out here i would appreciate
it, thanks for your time..Brian
