Hi Glenn,

A very quick number-crunching tells me that one motor per rear wheel  
gets you 20HP total power available. I don't think that will be  
sufficient to move a 3,000lb vehicle with a relatively high  
coefficient of drag at typical commuting velocity. But I could be  
wrong; maybe there's someone else here with more knowledge about  
electric motors.

FWIW, there is an electric VW Bus on eBay right now that has a motor  
rated at 23HP, and it has a rated top speed of 48MPH. See item  
#320137127199 for additional specs.
.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Any volts-wagen enthusiasts??  I've got a pretty nice 1969 Bay that  
&gt; would be
&gt; used mostly for short commutes, maybe 7 or 8 easy miles each way.   
&gt; Saw some
&gt; surplus 10 hp DC motors, very reasonably priced, and thought with  
&gt; fifteen 12 V
&gt; car batteries, which would fit easily in the cargo area, I might  
&gt; have a plan...
&gt; except of course for the CONTROL SYSTEM.  I'm going to work out  
&gt; some rough
&gt; numbers to see if this makes sense.... meantime would like to hear  
&gt; from anyone
&gt; who could point me to articles, references, sources, etc.
