Subject: 72 Bus FS in Junkyard, Sacramento
Mime-Version: 1.0


I saw a decent (purported) '72 bus.  It did have the pancake motor, but it
looked like someone tried a carb conversion - it has brand new carbs.  Nice
headliner, bumpers, all the seats, only a couple scratches on the paint,
orange with white top.  $850.  It's at Pull-N-Save, I think it's on Recylce
Road, but you can check 411 for Rancho Cordova.

That's all I know about it - spent about 5 minutes looking it over.
