Dear list-
	there was a guy a few days back that had a Toyota engine in the back of
his bus.  I cannot remember his name but it was painted like a cow.  He
got me thinking about my 69 bus, well my question is this.  I have a
buddy with an olds 350 with the tranny off an 84 buick Rivera.  I know of
some company that sells conversion kits to convert almost anything.  Does
anybody know what company this is?  I really wanna do this!  Can anybody
give me any constructive advice on this.   Also can I use the tranny off
the Rivera?  It was a front wheel drive car.  Any advice would be greatly
appreciated.  Thank you.  And to make the idea even more appealing, he
doesn't want anything for it.  I just have to pull it out of the car. 
The car was in a wreck.  Thanks in advance.

Chuck
