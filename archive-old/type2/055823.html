Subject: Re: Octane -- vs. RON

OK, since it's friday I'll tell you more about octane ratings than you
probably wanted to know.

The Octane number is a measure of a fuel's tendancy to &quot;ping&quot; or
ignite prematurely.  The higher the number, the better the resistance.

Fuels are tested in a special 1-cylinder engine with a cylinder head
that can be adjusted to vary the compression of the engine.  The
engine is driven by an electric motor at a constant speed.

A fuel is tested by feeding it to the engine and raising the
compression until the fuel starts to &quot;ping&quot;.  Then an attempt to match
this fuel is made with a mixture of Isooctane and Heptane (i'm a bit
fuzzy on this, so the substance names might be off).  If a mixture of
87% octane and 13% heptane produces exactly the same ping as the test
fuel, then the fuel is christened &quot;87 Octane&quot;.

The difference between the Motor and Research octane numbers have to
do with the way the test is run.  The same test engine is used, but
the test parameters are changed to meet the standards for each type of
test.
