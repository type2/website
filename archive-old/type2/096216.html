&gt; We have new T-4 heads. Previously they had only been available in square

&gt; 
&gt; These are made by Remmele, and the quality is outstanding (unmatched from
&gt; any I've seen). We are the North/South American distributor for these, but
&gt; they aren't &quot;budget&quot; heads either, but if you want NICE replacement heads,
&gt; look no further.

well I have been having bad luck with heads on my 78 2liter engine just
put on an AVP rebuild I got thru Bus Depot... but I would seriously
consider new ones, especially if this one (or the other side) go south. 

What do you charge for the new ones
