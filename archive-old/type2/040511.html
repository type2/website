Subject: Re: Hazet tool for tranny plugs

If anyone is interested in buying the right tool for this job, it's what VW
recommended back in 72 when I was wrenching for a living....Hazet part #
2567....the box end is angled just right for alt/gen nut removal for tensioning
the belt on type I....I've never had the hex end fail to remove a tranny
plug....

Mine is coming up for &quot;Vintage&quot; status....hmmmm

Den...

&gt; 1. The transaxle's got a thin layer of oil around the bottom (Nothing major,
&gt; just slow seepage).  Try as I might, I can't get that plug out to see if I'm
&gt; low....any special tools or tricks?
&gt;
&gt;     I say,&quot;I had the same prob when i got my bus.Tight as H#ll.
&gt; Soaked it with mouse milk over a few days then grabbed a chunk of 2 &quot; steel
&gt; pipe about 18&quot; long,
&gt; to add leverage to the home made (9/16&quot; bolt head welded to a 1&quot; steel rod )
&gt; wrench.
&gt; The plug came out :)
