&gt; I plan on converting to dual port heads ( with dual solex configuration ) in
&gt; the process, aside from the heads and intake manifolds, do I need to replace
&gt; the cooling tin with a newer style?

Yes, you need the dual port style cylinder tin.

Get used German tin if you can.  Repro stuff can be hard to fit.  Dual
port tin also tends to crack, so have any cracks brazed up before you
install it.  Once brazed, it remains crack-free.
