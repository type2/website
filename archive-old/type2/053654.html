It is my understanding that this third hose is a drain hose that will
become active if the diaphragm in the pump ruptures.

I believe Bus Depot sells kits to rebuild the stock fuel pump.  The kit is
expensive - I think it was about $40 which is about the same price as a
brand new brazilian fuel pump, but I would still use the kit.  Why you ask?
Because I have tried both the Brazilian pump and the Facet electric pump
and neither was a good permanent solution IMO.  It would take me a while to
write out the details - if you really want to know, ask me offline or I
will write it up when I get some more time.

&gt;Does anyone know what this thing is?  Could I cap that hose and make it home
&gt;(20 miles)?  Help! :)

I wouldn't cap that hose.  I would stick it in a soda bottle and ziptie the
bottle to the underside of the bus, then drive the 20 miles home and fix
it.  You carry a large fire extinguisher, right?  If not, buy one first.
Can't be too careful.
