Subject: Who's camping in Pontiac for the Auburn Hills show on the 21st

A listee from a Chicago/WI area club emailed me and said his group was going
to camp in a Pontiac area campground Saturday night.  That email is gone.
Would you mind posting again?  I might come down from Flint and contribute
to the circle, even if I head home again for the night.  Anyone?

Others from your neck of the woods might be interested, too.

See you Sunday, either way.  Look for Chris Huff's purple balloons.
