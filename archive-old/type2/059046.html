&gt;I'm interested in changing the engine on my 1973 bus which runs on a 1700
&gt;engine.  I need better gas milage and preformance but don't want anything I
&gt;can win an indy race with.

Better performance AND fuel economy? Hmmmm, difficult combination.

&gt;I wanted to inquire about &quot;beefing&quot; my engine up but fear the increase in heat
&gt;will ruin it.  What can I do with my original engine?  What kind of carbs
&gt;should I get?  Duel or single?  Any information would be great.

Firstly, with any performance engine, you need additional gauges to monitor it
properly. I'd recommend oil pressure and oil temperature as a minimum. Rev
counter is very useful too, whilst cyl head temp is less useful than oil temp
but still worthwhile.

Trouble is, the 'type 4' engine is expensive to tune and bits aren't widely
available, compared to the 'type 1' engine. An external oil cooler is essential.
I dunno about the 1700 (uses 66mm stroke) but the 2 litre uses 71mm stroke and
I know you can get oversize pistons/barrels of 103mm and 105mm. 103 will give you
2365cc with a 71mm stroke. Together with enlarged heads, decent exhaust and dual
Weber 40s you'll get about 140bhp. I got a quote for the above (plus balancing)
and it came out at......£3700!!!! So, it's not cheap.

I considered cheaper options but everything just seemed like a compromise.

Oh, another thought: how do you feel about fabricating mounts for a radiator? If
it doesn't put you off, then a wide range of water cooled engine swaps are
worth considering. I recommend you visit Kennedy Engineered Products
(www.kennedyeng_dot_com) and have a look at their brochure. About £1000 plus a lot
of time/effort should produce any level of performance you seem to desire.
