Subject: On the road again (cheap alternator fix)

Volks,

I gotta share this with y'all, because no one else understands.

I was a week without the beloved Groovemobile because the alternator
quit. Between work and other obligations, no shop, and typical wet
Pacific Northwest weather, the alternator (pulled and fixed last Sunday)
was on hold. Some very untypical sunshine (thank you, Lord) forced me to
take today off to put the Bus back together. We're back on the road. Yes!

About the fix: The charge light was on faintly (couldn't even see it in
the daytime) so I decided to gamble on a set of brushes. My VW parts
suppliers didn't have anything (didn't try the dealer, sorry DokTim) but
the American FLAPS was able to get them overnight. I think the alternator
is probably original (the tag had a VW as well as a Bosch part number)
and it took the 100W soldering gun to break the 25+ year old German
solder, but for some labor, some solder, and $2.48 she's charging again.
I know that I can't expect the same results as a Bosch reman, but I'm
feelin' pretty good right now. Maybe because the sun is shining in
February; maybe because I caught a pretty woman smiling at us this
afternoon; definitely because I love drivin' my Bus.

Happy Friday,
