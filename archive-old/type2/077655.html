&gt; UH, don't our buses get just about as poor gas mileage as those SUV's?
&gt; Ok, some of these monstrosities get about 8 mpg (I hope I'm exaggerating but probably not)
&gt; but that is the extreme.  If we're lucky, we get 20.  Better than 8, but not too good.
&gt; But I don't drive my bus for the gas mileage, I drive it because it has style.

Folks, this thread has the potential to become an anti-SUV flame war.
Unless you can offer constructive bus content, please don't continue it!
