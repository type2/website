Subject: Re: that connector to gas tank  &amp; fill pipe

That hose can be had in a straight version you have to kink.- look for
gas-resistant hose.......and check the connection of the gas inlet
opening to the fill pipe.  It can crack due to shoving the filler into
the rear, as NJ attendants will do when they use those _at_%#_at_$#&quot;spring
loaded &quot;clean air&quot; covers- so I fill it myself, holding the nozzle the
whole time to keep the tip pointed down.
  I had the same problem before our long 10K trip in 95, and I took a
piece of aluminum flashing wider than the hose piece by about 1.5&quot; on
each side and capable of running around it with a good amount of
overlap.  Lathered plenty silicone calk over the old tube, and put a
good layer on the flashing.  Wrap it over the old hose and hold it there
temporarily with tape or wire.  Then use 3 hose clamps (cloths dryer
kind, but find continuous screw adjustor style) to tighten it all so
silicone squishes out.  Haven't had the gas smell since, and I always
stop filling the tank at the first click.  I STILL HAVE THE CORRECT HOSE
WITH ME HOWEVER.....
