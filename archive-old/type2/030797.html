This is EXTENSIVELY covered in the archives.  Wire both wires to a
constant, fused power source.  This will save you from prematurely burned
points if you happen to be sitting there waiting on someone and you want
to listen to the radio.  This is also the original configuration.

&gt;It bites having to remember to turn off your radio
after you shut it off.

VW didn't use an accessory switch until what, 1993-4?  That means
that all VWs came NEW like this.  If there's noise coming out of your
speakers after you stop, turn off the radio.
