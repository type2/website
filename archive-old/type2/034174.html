Subject: Intake valve clearance closing up?

Went out to adjust the valves today (currently 80 degrees in Sunny
SoCal!) and had an odd occurance.

Engine is a stock 1600DP.

Everything went fine (no adjustment needed) until I got to the #3
_intake_ valve.  It had zero clearance.  I didn't believe it, so I
started over with #1 at TDC.  Spun it 1 full turn counterclockwise, so
#3 should be at TDC.  Still no clearance on the #3 intake valve. 
Adjusted it to .006 and continued on to #4, which was fine.

Has anyone heard of an _intake_ valve stretching or rapid intake valve
seat recession?  I've heard of this sort of thing in exhaust valves,
but not in intakes.  It's also possible that the valve was stuck
partially open the last time I adjusted it, but I don't recall whether
I changed the setting the last time around.  I have to keep better
records...

This engine is up for replacement soon, but I hoped to get about 2000
more miles out of it (trips to Nevada and to BBBIV) before pulling it. 
I plan on running it another 400 miles and then checking the valve
clearance again.

Speculation?  Horror stories?  Gales of laughter?
