X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

before i get raked over the colas for passing this info on we just went
through this on the folk dj list i'm on.  the virus or worm persisted for
several days. it may be off topic but someone unknowinly spread it to this
list.  hopefully this info will help.


The Happy99 program is a virus, a worm to be more precise. The virus sends
itself as an attachment in a second email message whenever the infected
machine sends an email.

While this worm will not harm data, it will bring a LAN to it's knees.

DO NOT OPEN the happy99 file.

Here is how to eliminate it if you were infected:

1. Search your C: drive for files &quot;ska.exe&quot; &amp; &quot;ska.dll&quot;.
2. Delete them.
3. Go to DOS and delete &quot;wsock32.dll&quot; file
4. Rename your &quot;wsock32.ska&quot; file to &quot;wsock32.dll&quot;.
********** 
 If you don't run the
program, you have nothing to worry about. Mac users are unaffected.

As has been said here around these parts recently, all you need to do
is run this program once; from that point on, it sends itself to
every address you send email.
