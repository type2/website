Hey everbody,
Today i got the new JC whitney catalog for vw's.  It seems that they are
expanding thier product line which could be nice.  I saw a bosch
electronic ignition for 100$.  It had a modified 009 and a silver box
too.  It said it was a complete breakerless ignition.  How does this one
compare to say the Bug pak or the compufire?  any responses will be
greatly appreciated
