Subject: Re: [T2] Subject: Modern Brake Switch


&gt;When I get a tailgaiter who refuses to pass me I simply slow down to
&gt;somewhere around 15 mph below speed limit. This really frustrates them and
&gt;they then figure out some creative way to pass me. Sometimes it is even by
&gt;moving left and  into the passing lane...
-------------------------------------

Sadly, I must reply that this approach is no longer very effective out here in the Greater Seattle/Puget Sound area.  It might even get you shot...

Around here, driving in the curb lane of a city arterial at _ONLY_ 5 MPH over the posted limit will get you deluged with &quot;negative feedback&quot;.  

Comments in casual conversation along the lines of &quot;...and the SOB refused to drive more than [5, 10, any number will do] MPH over the limit, and he/she made me late for...&quot; are common in gatherings at any level of society, polite or otherwise. 

It's my experience that VW buses may receive a slightly higher level of tolerance in this regard from drivers of sedans, etc.  But drivers of SUVs, especially those newly transitioned from mini-vans, seem to operate in a constant state of irritation at other drivers/vehicles including VW buses.

With apologies to Kermit, it's not easy being air-cooled...
