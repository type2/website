Subject: Re: [T2] cup holders on thesamba?

Kool.  And you may notice that I have some black electric tape around the 
holder.  Look closer...

This is for the passenger side only.

On the driver side, it is just basic.

Why??

Well, These damn holders are so strong, I can use the 44 oz cups from 7-11.  
It is just that they are so heavy that they 'push thru' the open fingers of 
the cup holder; the weight causes the fingers to spread open and the 
huge/heavy 44 oz cup to flip out.

But with the black electrical tape (this is the kind of tape that my dad 
used for everything some 50 years ago, so I tend to use it myself now.) 
holding the fingers closed, the little bottom of the 44 oz cup fits nicely 
in the holder and the cup does not flip out.

I did not do this on my driver side because I can still put some fatter cups 
in the driver side holder, making the driver side holder more versatile.  I 
usually put the 20 oz coffee cup in the driver side, but if I am going for 
the largest cup I can get at 7-11 because of the summer heat, I use the 
driver side holder for the BIGGIEs, and just pour off some Coke in a smaller 
cup for drinking as I drive.

The passenger side holder with the  tape can still hold a 12 oz can of 
beverage.

Note:  If you use Sheetz service plazas, you already know they are really 
nice people.  On a hot day, you can go in with an 'other than Sheetz' empty 
cup, and load it up with just ice, and ask at the checkout what they would 
charge for just ice - refill.  Since it is obviously a refill - not a Sheetz 
cup, and with you driving a VW type 2 in the hot summer, (Hey, I know what 
you look like, and smell like!!), the nice person at Sheetz will probably 
say, 'thank you for stopping at Sheetz; have a nice day...'

And, o f course, this depends on the amount of Karma you have built up can 
be transferred over to the Sheetz nice person.

&gt;That is a classic way to solve the cup holder question. I was seriously 
&gt;considering buying one of the others found on TheSamba...but now I am just 
&gt;going to run down to Wal-mart and buy one of yours.
