Subject: 72 bus progress
Content-Disposition: inline

I picked a likely transmission, installed the proper front mount, sawed the old
heater boxes off what might have been a stock muffler once, installed a new
shift coupler, followed by the transmission and axles, Drive axle has only 4 out
of 6 bolts
until I can drill out the two broken ones, installed new clutch cable, tube,
wingnut and TO bearing, new starter and bushing, replaced fuel line, extended my
inspection sticker from the 7th to the 9th with a little cutting and pasting,
installed the little transmission goodies like the ground strap, back up light
wires, changed the transmission fluid, turned to the motor and replaced the
outside fan housing half because of a bad coil screw hole, installed the motor
without the exhaust for manageability, changed the motor oil and filter,
installed two fuel filters and fresh line to each carb, adjusted clutch,
installed
heater boxes, replaced points cond, rotor.

Next I must intall new muffler &amp; tailpipe, battery, dist/spark plug wires, coil
&amp; wiring, air cleaner, fresh gas and probably rear brakes.

Biggest Problem: Accelerator cable. While trying to loosen up old one it snapped
inside tube and the front half won't come out. The tube it runs in is apparently
rusty from the flood and it looks like I may half to cut the tube to find the
clog. Also it's not clear whether a 74 cable will work in a 72 bus using a 74
motor. First off, the pedal end of the cable is different, no hook just a bent
wire. I may order another 72 just in case. Day 13 on a 10 day sticker I'm
pushing my luck.....
