&gt; So today, I get a bill from trucking company #2 that delivered 
&gt; engines #2 and #3 stating that I owe an extra $62.50 for shipping,
&gt; stating higher fuel costs as the reason.  Do you think they have a
&gt; snowball's chance in hell of getting one red cent out'a me?

Now, Brian--fair's fair.  I say, send THEM a bill for your time, expenses,
mileage, etc. due to the &quot;local idiot&quot; ruining the second engine with a
fork lift.  The bill should clearly note that you've credited their $62.50
on account, and are invoicing them for the balance due.  [&quot;Check or money
order only, please; no stamps or cash.  Thank you for prompt payment.&quot;]

Let's see what kind of response THAT gets from them.

best
