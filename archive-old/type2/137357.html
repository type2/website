Subject: Flywheel bolt torque spec?

Hi Volks,

I'm tired and can't find seem to find this in the  Bentley... WHat's 
the torque spec for the flywheel bolts on a 2L T4 engine?

Why do I need to know this?  I'm putting the Sunroof's engine into the 
Westfakia for the spring while I hunt for the exxon valdez oil leak in 
the Westfakia Engine. I pulled the Sunroof's engine on Monday, and 
today I got the engine out of the Westfakia and transferred the 
required FI components and gauge senders, heat riser pipes,, etc. All I 
have left to do now is torque up the flywheel, bolt the clutch and 
pressure plate into place and re-install the engine. If the &quot;nice&quot; 
weather holds I'll be doing that tomorrow AM.

This will give me a chance to check out the sunroof motor during the 
trip to the TCWBC next month, before we use it to take the family to 
EveryBus in April.

I'll spring for pizza and beer for lunch if the locals are interested 
in assisting. P-mail to let me know if you're attending.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
