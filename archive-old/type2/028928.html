AD engine up to AD290640 = 5 degree ATDC with vacuum hose to distributor on
AD engine from AD290641 = 7 1/2 (seven and a half) degrees BTDC with vacuum
hose to distributor off.

But that's with the standard single vacuum distributor,

Good luck

Anyone out there got experience of timing a euro-spec 1600 DP with dual vac
engine code AD any help appreciated as the bentley doesn't mention the AD
and what to time it at with my newly purchased strobe/inductive timing light
Thanx Martin.
