The only odd failures I've seen with mine is one broken cylinder stud.
I've heard of one other person who had this problem.  I don't know if this
was a metallurgy or torque problem, but it was sure a shocker when I
pulled the valve cover to adjust the valve and saw that stud hanging out!

If I had it to do again, I'd still buy a Meximotor, but I would pull the
cylinder studs and replace them with known good German studs.  It's easy
before you install the engine in the bus.
