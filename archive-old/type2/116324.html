Subject: Re: [T2] R: [T2] Trash into oil

Bro... hold on a second here. Think about what you're saying. How can you
say that people that drive big engine'd cars don't have a conscience??
 
I am soo proud to be an American, it makes me sick. I'm an obnoxious
Republican, and proud as hell about it. 
I own one of the most OBNOXIOUS HUGE vehicles in the world, a 1978 Cadillac
Eldorado Biarritz Convertible.. the last of the battleships. It's soo huge,
that EVEN when the back of the car is touching the wall of my garage, the
garage door won't close. I'll be DAMNED if someone is going to tell me I
can't drive that. 
 
I care about the ecology of this country too.. you know what? I have a
catalytic converter on every single one of my cars except the VW Transporter
because I have no idea where the hell to put it. I even put dual cats on my
Caddy...
 
Just so you know... the United States has some of the CLEANEST running cars
in the world. We have extremely high emissions standards here. Especially
california. The air is cleaner now in the US than it has been in the past 80
years.
And like everyone else has said, the VW Transporter is NOT an emissions
caring car. 
 
I own a 472 cubic inch V8 (that's over 7 liters) in my Caddy, I have a 5.7
liter (chevy motor) in my 1981 Smokey &amp; The Bandit II TransAm, I have a 3.2
liter in my 87 Pontiac Fiero... and I wouldn't trade them for anything
except my health, and the health of my fiance. (and World Peace, no hunger..
etc) 
 
Every year that goes by, cars become cleaner and cleaner. This is due in
part of course because of enironmentalists.. and I can respect that... you
need to make sure the environment doesn't go to hell. But the other part is
due to technology. The more efficient an engine runs, the better the fuel
economy.
 
Anyway, you're entitled to your opinion.... HOWEVER..... 
 
HERE is where YOU Need to be careful... there's a difference between being
an enironmentalist, and being a realist.
The best approach for this world (or the US in your case) would be for car
companies to produce more efficient cars (which they ARE doing). But forcing
people to take their collector cars OFF the road... to use a coined term I
like to use.. &quot;un-American&quot;.
 
Screw that.. I'm going to continue to drive my 21 foot long Cadillac
Eldorado Biarritz Convertible with the level ride control, the plush leather
seats that consists of about 5 cow carcauses, the 7 something liter V8 big
block... and when that guy in the Honda pulls up next to me and looks at me
with disgust... I'll look back at that boring, little tin coffin, and not
give a c**p.
 
FYI, I drive my 2.4 liter 4 cyl 1997 Pontiac GrandAm 95% of the time (gets
34 miles to the gallon on the highway).
 
 
 
Thanks for playing....

Am not bashing the SUV in particular, am bashing those who don't have a 

&quot;conscience&quot; because they live in one of bigest and most free (sorry for 

my English here) continent in the world.
