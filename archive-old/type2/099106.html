Subject: Dual battery wiring

I bought a Hella dual battery relay kit from Ron recently but the
instructions don't make sense to me.  The only wiring that's really
clear is the brown to earth.  All other connections are left open to
interpretation.  I know lots of you have done this and I'll probably get
several different answers but I'm open to suggestions.

Red - diagram shows it going to the vehicle battery and then to the
vehicle circuits.  But the end on the wire would seem to support some
destination other than the battery.
Black - could really use a specific suggestion where to tie this in as
the directions imply that if you just start testing connections to find
out what's hot when the key is on you'll be successful.
Blue/red - What the heck is a 12/7S socket? Connect to pin 2 or pin 6 -
huh?

My application is a '71 Adventurewagen with original wiring intact for
dual battery with isolator.  Also, a couple weeks ago my charging light
came on and after switching over to a new 55 amp alternator failed to
turn the light off it was found that by bypassing the original wiring
and going directly from the alternator to the battery the problem went
away.  I'm guessing that maybe the isolator might be the cause of that
problem but this shows that the original wiring may not be reliable so I
don't want to just plug and play without knowing what works for other
people.
