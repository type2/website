&gt; I'd like to build a spare type4 engine for my bus, but the one I have in it
&gt; is just fine so it may be up to 10 years before I need the next one.

Who sells Cosmolene? That's the disgusting heavy grease the Army uses to
rustproof guns.

What I would do if I wanted a spare engine is to buy parts as money and good
deals on parts appear, and pack them in Cosmolene until I needed them. Then
stash them in a cool, dry area, like some big Army ammo cans (a Mk. 19 ammo
can will hold any part in a Volkswagen engine except the case; you'll need
five or six of them to hold the whole engine) with silica gel in them.

Saving up for the engine is a good idea except that some day you're going to
come home and find out the kids &quot;really needed&quot; a bed shaped like a race car
and, well, that money was sitting in the bank not doing anything...
