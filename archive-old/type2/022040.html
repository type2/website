Hi Randall,

I respect your experiece. This is mine. 

When I picked up my new (first owner) bus with just 
26km on the clock, I drove it 200 miles on main roads 
at about 50mph to my first stop off point. Directly on 
stopping I applied the 'dip stick test' and yes I could 
hold it; but I wouldn't have liked it had it been much 
hotter. I can still apply the dip skick test without burning 
my hand.

Off couse if I lived somewhere hotter (eg South USA, 
Mexico, Brazil...) rather than the temperate UK my 
experience may be different.

Over advanced ignition, over lean mixture, improper 
choking, inadequate manifold preheat, worn AFM electric 
tracks (amongst other things) can all cause the van to 
run poorly when cold and over hot after warm up.

Yes I do have a completely different FI system to 
anyone else on this list, but my van now with 25000km 
runs smashing straight from cold. Just as my previous 
bus (1600, 34Pict3, 009) did.

Good luck

&gt;I usually hate worn out threads, but this is a vastly 
important issue.
&gt;Assuming my oil temp gauge is correct, my bus runs 
like crap at 170-190.  It
&gt;runs significantly better between 200-220, but I start 
taking measures to
&gt;cool down when I reach 240.  I can't imagine driving all 
the time at
&gt;170-190.  I hear a lot of people say that you should 
be able to comfortably
&gt;pinch the end of the dipstick after driving a bus that is 
cooling properly.
&gt;To them I say try pinching a dipstick that has been 
boiling in water at only
&gt;212 for a few minutes and tell me how comfortable 
that is.  I have even
&gt;tried pinching the dipsticks in my water cooled Jeep 
Cherokee, Nissan
&gt;Frontier, and Pontiac Grand Prix and this old wives tale 
is simply garbage.
&gt;If you can pinch the dipstick you are running waaaay 
too cool.  Take care.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Since I plan to put an oil temp guage on my 74 bus, I 
have been following
&gt;this thread with interest. As near as I can summarize, 
oil temps need to go
&gt;above 212F in order to drive out moisture, and temps 
of 220 - 240 are pretty
&gt;much OK.
&gt;
&gt;Now for the monkey wrench: as I was tinkering in the 
engine compartment of
&gt;my bus last night, I noticed the remains of a spec 
sticker on the fan box.
&gt;This is a 74, originally set up with a 1700 engine that, 
according to the
&gt;sticker, met all emissions requirements in effect for 
CA. It gives the
&gt;timing as 10ATDC and then says: OIL TEMPERATURE 
170-190F.
&gt;
&gt;That seems awfully low to me. Any opinions?
&gt;
