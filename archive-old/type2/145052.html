Subject: Seats 4 Sale Kansas City must picku...

FYI,

I have two middle and one rear seat for sale in Kansas
City (Grandview) Missouri.  I'm trying to make room in
the garage and the wife has made it clear I'm not
going to be allowed a 3rd bus which I was saving these
for as it never fails I find a great bus with no seats
(been working on her for years but now i admit
failure....)

I detest &quot;scum-bay&quot; and these parts are too big for me
too ship, so if you can pickup or are local to Kansas
City we can deal privately via email off-list.  I
pulled these from 74 and 75 bus over 10 years ago at a
local junk yard in KC and they have been in my garage
since.

One 3/4 brown Middle seat good condition (looks
great).
One 3/4 brown Middle seat Medium condition.
One rear brown seat Medium condition.

Condition of medium means they are showing their age,
but still good enough to use without major work, (no
rips, no rust, some discoloration, arm rest pops off).

No hardware.  Price negotiable based on best offer. 
Must pick up.  Reply via email and pleaser remove the
[T2] from the subject line so my filter doesn't
auto-file the email.

Bob
