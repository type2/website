Subject: Re: [T2] New to This, Need some Advice.

Hi Stephanie,

Welcome to the wonderful world of old VW ownership!  It sounds like the shop 
you took it to is pretty knowledgeable about old (air-cooled) VWs, and it 
sounds like they were pretty honest about what your Bus needs.  On the other 
hand, they may have taken the &quot;she's a chick and doesn't know any better&quot; 
approach, in which case you should avoid going there ever again.

That said, there are several small things you can do to get your feet wet 
and see how you like working onj it yourself.  The shocks are pretty easy, 
and the brakes are pretty easy once you get the axle nut off.  The tie rod 
ends are a little more complicated, and the axle boots are kind of a pain.

But, the best way to see if you can do it is to try.  Use all your manuals, 
read them well, discuss with your mechanically-minded friends, and give it a 
shot.  If worst comes to worst, you can always take your Bus back to the 
mechanics.

Good luck, and enjoy your new Bus!

Take care,
Jason Upper
