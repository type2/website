Subject: [T2] VDO Guage-problem SOLVED * Your first thought is usually the right one*

A big thank you to all *TIM* who offered help/ideas for my *oil temp gauge*
problem.

I changed the GROUND wire *from the gauge* to a separate DEDICATED ground on
the front panel, under the dash and whala, we now have true temperature
reading's with the gauge..........
