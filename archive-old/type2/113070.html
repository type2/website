Subject: I'm a happy camper!

Well, even though I dropped 300 bux yesterday to have my engine pulled
and plug replugged (remember the oil mess), I have great news today!

So, I thought, I'm gonna pull my tank out and see if I can figure out
why my pump keeps making noise.  So, I lowered the engine, pulled out
the tank, and took a look.  At first I was kinda confused.. the tank
looked pristene.. sealant was good.. maybe a few spots of rust, but
nothing much.  Then I looked from another angle.....

... you know that little round foil piece that covers those fuel
injector cleaner bottles or fuel additives... I saw one of those stuck
smack dab over the inlet of the tank!!!

So, now I'm gonna rinse the tank out, put it back in and be a happy
camper again ;)

Mike
