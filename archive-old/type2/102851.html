Subject: Re: [T2] master cyl leaking?

&gt;I have been searching the net for a description of why that hole is 
&gt;supposed to be there....but alas, I have
&gt;stuck out.

Karl, the first site in your note says

... &quot;If you  inspect the base of the master cylinder, you will notice that 
there is a groove in the base just below the round bore.
This slot acts as a drain when the master begins to leak, hopefully keeping 
the fluid from entering the booster.&quot;

and you confirm the explanation below...

&gt;
&gt;Yes, the hole is supposed to be there. It is the drain hole for when the 
&gt;rear plunger [secondary cup] seal
&gt;leaks. It appeared when power brakes came along. Because of the vacuum on 
&gt;the end of the master when it is
&gt;mounted on the booster, they had to add a rear seal. This keeps the vacuum 
&gt;from sucking the fluid out of the
&gt;master. When the secondary cup seal leaks, it is supposed to drain out the 
&gt;weep hole. The rear seal is
&gt;supposed to keep the fluid from draining into the booster.
&gt;I did find this website about a guy changing his Toyota master cylinder and 
&gt;he talks about the drain hole:
&gt;http://www_dot_cascadecrawlers_dot_com/toyota/mcinstall/index.shtml
&gt;This site talks about the master cyl. leaking onto the booster, but not 
&gt;why...:
&gt;http://fc3s-pro_dot_com/TECH/PROBLEMS/BRAKE/bmc.htm


I guess this answers the question, Why is it there...

It seems like such a reasonable answer that the next questions is,   &quot;Why 
did they NOT put the weep hole there in later MB  Cylinders???&quot;
