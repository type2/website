Hi All!

Seems as of late I have had two issues with my bus. First is that sometimes 
it holds charge and sometimes it won't. It's a six month old battery. Any 
ideas what i should look for? The generator light is not on.

Also, when i first stsart the bus, i have to stay with is an hold the 
accelerator down to give it a fair amount of fuel, or else it will cut off. 
After about five minutes of this, it will idle ok and not shut off. i have 
noticed though that this tends to flood it. This is not a problem I've 
encountered with my Ghia! I have tried to remove the air filter and spray 
carb cleaner in it. It starts easier, but still has a hard time idleing until 
it's very warm. 

I have finished all body work on the camper and hope to have it painted next 
weekend! ( i cant wait!)

Any help is appreciated!

Many thanks!
