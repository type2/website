Subject: more help with push rods

Thanks all for the help.

 

I did see a slight bend in a push rod, so slight that I have to carefully
inspect it, but I expect it will run long enough that I need it.

 

It is engine damage, I know.

 

How do I properly seat the push rods as I assemble every thing?

 

I expect the vehicle to clatter with no oil pressure for some time, or is
there a way around this?
