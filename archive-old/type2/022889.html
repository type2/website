Not sure about that bit about changing out the screen.

Ever look at the mesh size on some of the new replacements screens? A 
bit bigger than the original OEM ones from what I could tell by looking.
I still have my original OEM screens, plus a few spares scrounged up 
elsewhere for spares purposes.

I tend to think it might be better to wash and re-use the originals, as 
opposed to installing not so good current production screens.

As for Quaker State being bad, well I don't know about that either. 
Have any idea how many different lubricant named brands are product 
sourced from Quaker State?
