&gt;   I regularly go to a Chinese restaurant, where they have a great buffet,
&gt; &gt; at a very good price. Not only that, the drive there is through a very
&gt; &gt; nice neighborhood that has very few stray dogs and cats!

It's a subset of the belief that heaven is where the
police are English, the mechanics are German, and
the cooks are French...Hell, however, has German
police, French mechanics and English cooks... ;-(
