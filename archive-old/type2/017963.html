&gt;I know that a buddy of mine used to get between 28- 30 mpg on the highway in

Sorry about the scr*w up with converting to mp(US)g; 35 mp(UK)g = 29mp(US)g,
which isn't too far removed from the above (1 US gallon = 0.833 Imperial
gallon). It's this sort of snippet that makes you think that there's something
in this 30 mpg busines. (I don't mind constant 55!).

I take George Lyle's point, and this echos my own scepticism, but unfortunately
this bus is off the road now. The guy seems completely genuine. Even if you
factor in some BS allowance, it's still good mileage.

Then Joe goes and rubs it in by claiming an average of 24 mp(US)g = 29mp(UK)g.
(I also liked Joe's slant on saving petrol money by living in the bus!)

I would do anything for mileage like that! I'm currently getting ~16 mp(US)g - I
did have my conversions mucked up. 

The one thing that these have in common is that they are stock motors (which
tallies with Volkswagen knowing best).

AAARGH - This is agonising!! I've got records going back 2 years, or more, and
NOTHING I've done has altered the mileage by more than a marginal amount: best
ever 18mp(US)g, worst ever 13 mp(US)g. This includes changing driving style, and
even changing the engine! It's like looking through the window of a sweet-shop,
and not being able to find the door!

It sounds like I have a problem: Compressions are 120+/-5 all round (checked 3-4
months ago); valve clearances all OK &amp; stable (1 adjustment necessary in last 12
months); Brakes not binding; tyres pumped up (but 195 section on rear); 34PICT3
as stock (not rebuilt, but throttle spindle tight) - rebuilt carb gives
margainally worse mpg; Choke works OK (currently backed off as far as posible);
Stock oil-bath filter (clean) &amp; thermo-valve working OK; Aftermarket, stock
exhaust; 009 Dist currently at 5degs BTDC, but has mostly been at 7.5 degs BTDC;
I can't remember the exact problem that led me to change to the 009, but I was
talked into it by the local VW fixer (not a dealer) pre list. I can't remember
which of the 3 vac advance distributors I have was the original (none of them
are the stock ones), and trialing them in turn results in worse mpg than with
the 009 and worse 'drive-ability'; recently replaced coil &amp; HT leads; electronic
ignition fitted for ~last 12 months - gives margainly better mpg.

One question on the 009: Should the advance stop at a certain RPM ? Mine just
seems to advance further &amp; further the higher I rev the engine. The power
(dictionary definition) all seems to be at the top end (25-30 in 2nd, 45-50 in
3rd, and 55-60 in 4th. Retarding the timing just knocks off the top end, without
any improvement lower down. I realise that these figures are beyond VW's
approved shifting points.

Sorry to ramble on, but all contributions gratefully received.
