Subject: RE: Porsche Engines in busses

I spent at least 1/2 hour in discussion with the owner of this 1976 RIVIERA 
Camper.

The engine is a Porsche 911, and the 911 5-speed transaxle is also in the bus. 
 This man spent thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours very carefully 
engineering and then re-engineering this one-off conversion.  Although, to his 
credit and that of the various pros that assisted in the process the 
installation is beautifully executed and could pass for a &quot;factory&quot; job, it's 
certainly not a project for the timid or economically challenged.  He claimed 
not to have a bottom line figure for his obviously considerable financial 
investment.

The van also sports custom-made ground effects additions, major interior 
customization, and an RV-type rollup side awning mounted to the RIVIERA 
straight-up poptop.  

The actual engine/transaxle installation is not obvious from the outside.  The 
only external bodywork modification to accommodate the engine is a small 
exhaust plumbing clearance notch in the rear valance, which is obscured by the 
stock bumper.

A major weakness is the inner CV joints.  After much re-engineering and custom 
machining and fabrication the inner CV joint life has been extended beyond 
7,000 miles.  Outer CV joints have not been a problem.  In both locations he's 
using stock late Type 2 joints.

This camper is absolutely immaculate, and would be a show-stopper/show winner 
even without the 911 power.

FWIW.....

in particular the guy who put a 911 engine in his bus. &lt;&lt;
