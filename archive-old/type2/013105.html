It is on Sunday the 6th, I have the flyer right here in my hand.
I believe you can confirm this on the Texas Motorplex website.
We have a large convoy leaving from Abilene on the 5th to go down and
camp out.

would be great to meet up with other type2 folks there!

&gt; The VW fest in Ennis this weekend shows to be on the 7th. 
&gt; 
&gt; That is a durned Monday. 
&gt; Anybody have any idea if there will be anything to see Sunday?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
