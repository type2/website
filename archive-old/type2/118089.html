&lt;&lt; True, they prey upon the ignorance of car owner's, pump their egos, sell

relativistic society, it matters not how you get the money, it's THAT you 
get the money, however, that is the measure of success. It is no wonder 
that the king of charlatans got elected twice and claimed the successes of 
his priors as his, then left a mess for others to rectify.

Sheeesh, I gotta reset my calendar...I didn't know the 2004 election had
come and gone already... ;-(
