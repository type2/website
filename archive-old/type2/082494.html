Subject: what is this device

I have a 74 bus.
In the engine cmprtment on the right side
mounted on the &quot;back wall&quot; is a elect, device.
It is white plastic and housed in a metal can
which is attached to the firewall. It has 4-5 wires
going to it. I is very hot to the touch.
What is it and should it be this hot?
Cant find it in the manual.

TIA
