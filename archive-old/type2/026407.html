Well, I sent a note to the list as soon as it started, but I guess that never made it.

It was the resistor block that supplies the injectors. I had gotten okay readings on the tests to this, but the fact that it started briefly and then died indicated to me (with input from other listees) that it was only getting fuel from the cold start valve. Since I already knew I had pressure and I didn't think I would have 4 bad injectors, I decided to replace the series resistance block with a spare I had. That was the magic bullet.

BTW, I looked up the oil pressure specs in Bentley and it looks like I'm within spec on that. I'll really need to hook up a tachometer and test against specific RPMs (2500 RPM _at_ 158 F should yield 42 PSI for a new part). I realize that these oil pressure gauges are really only good for *relative pressure* since they're not calibrated, anyway...but I think I was a little too worried. I'm not saying I'm happy to see oil pressure drop to 10 or 12 lbs at idle--at *any temperature*--but I'm also not so sure that I'll find it necessary to pull this engine right away and replace the oil pump. I *did* reuse the old oil pump, though, and I'm thinking that may be a good item to replace when I pull the engine to retorque the heads.

Thanks for all the help from everyone! It's like a community project that spans the globe.

:) Joe

&gt;&gt; Well, I'm not freaking out, but I can't say I'm totally thrilled with the first 16.5 minutes of running my bus. Bottom line: too many oil leaks; sounds like there's an exhaust leak, and the oil pressure was dropping too rapidly for my taste.

&gt;Joe,
&gt;Well I guess you got it started but I am curious as to what the problem
&gt;was that kept it from starting earlier.
