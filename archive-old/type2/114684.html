Subject: Side door needs fixing!

I have a '73 that needs to have the side door worked on.  The bottom track is
actually intact, but the body frame that the track it attached to
(specifically the area closer to the passenger seat) is rusting out.  The
weight of the door causes the rusted body frame to bend down and therefore
removes the sliding door from the TOP frame.  It appears that I just need to
have a newer metal beam placed underneath the bottom track.
 
My question is:  Does anyone know a good &amp; affordable VW repair shop anywhere
in the greater Seattle area? (Preferably closer to downtown...but not
necessary).  I would love to get the door working properly again!
 
Thanks,
-RR
