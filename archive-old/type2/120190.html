&gt; OK, I have to clean up TWO oil spills.
&gt; After I get the oil wiped up by paper towel, what
&gt; COMMERCIAL PRODUCT do you 
&gt; recommend to clean up the final film of oil on the
&gt; concrete.

Sprinkle on some of that cat-litter type stuff, I
think the Product brand name is &quot;Absorb-All&quot;. Dump
some on the spill and step on top of it to really
smash it into the concrete. Let it sit for a couple of
days, and sweep it up with a broom.  Before my dad
retired, he repaired electrical transformers, which
are oil cooled and filled with nasty oil. I have seen
this absorb-all work wonders on some really hefty spills.
