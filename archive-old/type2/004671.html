Check the List archives.

We've been through this thread before, and several sources were cited.  I
can't find my own catalog just now, but one of the woodworking supply houses
had the molding available in several colors and sold by the foot.

&gt;&gt;  Outwater will send samples, ask for some samples of what you think is
close or if you have a small piece send it to them, they probably have one
of the largest selections of plastics &quot;shaped&quot;, thier problem is that they
have such huge min quantities and their prices are not exceptionally low.
