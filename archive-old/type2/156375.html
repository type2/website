&gt; How timely! I was just getting ready to look into
&gt; why the brake lights
&gt; are not working on the 75 Camper I'm putting
&gt; together!

Flushing the brake system is important not only for
the switches - it helps to lessen corrosion in the
entire system - but the notorious proportioning valves
need to be squeeky clean inside to function properly.

As for the brake light switches - don't get
discouraged if your new ones don't work as well as
your old ones! I have heard that the percentage of
&quot;good&quot; new ones is very low.

Sometimes it is a bubble that makes them function only
at the end of the pedal stroke (full pressure / hard
braking) where the bubble is finally compressed enough
that the switch starts to move. Some people pre-fill
the switch and smack it a few times on a hard surface
to get the bubble to rise out, then leave the switch
loose on install and bleed it via the loose joint.

This can be done while under the vehicle by pulling
down on the pedal arm with one hand while
tightening/loosening the switch body with the other
hand. (Safety goggles and a few layers of shop
towels!)

An alternative but not &quot;pure&quot; is to add a mechanical
switch under the pedal arm. The wires to the other
switches pass right by there and you can just splice
in two short sections, thus leaving the existing wires
on the existing switches in case you ever want to go
back.
I got mine at my FLAPS for under $10 and I haven't had
that lady in the white Mercedes flip me off for
months!
