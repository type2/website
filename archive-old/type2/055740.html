&gt;Is this bus air-cooled?  The '80s-90's buses I saw in Mexico are powered by
&gt;an inline water cooled four cylinder.  tom
&gt;
To quote the advert from Bettles (UK) Ltd-
New 1998 &quot;Type 2's&quot;
1.6 Fuel Injection, Air Cooled, Vans, Campers and
Seven Seater Buses, From 9995 + VAT on the road

The advert has a small picture of a panel van and a bus. The only
differences I can see from the late 70s bay window is early style bumbers
(ie not steel girder), bigger mirrors, a black and not white grill and a
diferent slightly higher roofline.

I am e mailing them for more details.
