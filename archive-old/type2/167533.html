&gt; Bob, on my engine that was the hole for the temperature sender when it

I have no idea mine always had the sender in the head near the intake, the
threaded hole in the head.

&gt; I've got a CB engine that has that very same hole you describe.  I don't
&gt; know its history, but I do know at one time, on some type IV engines,
&gt; the head temperature sender was buried underneath the tin and in the
&gt; head near the #3 sparkplug....a design that was fixed in later years.
&gt; Is it possible that your bus has early tin on it?  Greg

hmmm possible, I'm just trying to figure out how to plug it without
messing with air flow to the cyl
