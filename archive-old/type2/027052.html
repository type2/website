Hey everybody,

  I found a 1979 VW Bus for sale for $900. The guy called me last night to 
see if I was interested but I just got a 71 camper 2 days ago. I told him I 
would post his info here though. He is leaving Friday in his 78 camper for 
California and needs to sell this fast. If he doesn't sell it he will 
probably have to give it away.

Anyway Here is the info:

1979 VW Bus
Orange and Brown
Runs and looks good

Call Don _at_ 302.377.5498 if interested. Tell him Joe Sent you.

Good luck,

Joe Fialkowski

71 Campmobile
