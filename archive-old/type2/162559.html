&gt; Having driven two 71 campers, one with a rebuild engine (original case
&gt; and crank) and one with a Meximotor, I would suggest the meximotor.
&gt; The &quot;meximotor&quot; is a new VW 1600cc type 1 engine (longblock) that has
&gt; received some of the later improvements and has been used in bugs and
&gt; busses sold in south America until recently.

I didn't think the Meximotor was avalaible anymore in this country
