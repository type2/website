Subject: EB02 Pix

Hey y'all, here's most of my pix from Everybus.  My ISP won't allow me to 
put them all up because is't over 10 megs so when it quits, that's 
it.   Too bad, there's a good pic of RoadCow towing and haulage leaving.

Would the nice lady that won the Veggie Chili cookoff please p-mail me?
Mad Uncle Dave
