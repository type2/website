&gt; I am a long time Type 1 owner, recently converted to Type 2 !  Purchased a 1978 Westy in very solid condition, but neglected by the previous owner. I have recently installed used replacement wiper motor.. now wipers work ! Also installed missing sink/stove cabinet that was missing when I bought the bus, however have not hooked up the gas or water yet (May need help on that later).

&gt; outside and inside. I removed the door panel and took a look. I did
&gt; not see any adjusting nut for the cable on my 1978 per suggestions on

no it should be there I have a 78 and have had to adjust mine.

it is near the handle end, just two nuts on a shaft.
