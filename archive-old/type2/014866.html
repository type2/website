&gt; Thought I broke a clutch cable so bought a new one.  When I got ready to 
&gt;  replace it it found it wasn't the cable at all.  The fitting on the clutch 
&gt;  pedal assembly in the front of the bus that the cable fastens to had 
&gt; wallowed 
&gt;  out over the ages and the pin that fastens the cable to the fitting had 
&gt;  broken due to the play allowing it to &quot;saw&quot; through.  If you have nothing 
to 
&gt;   do, take out the two bolts that hold the clutch pedal assemble and check. 
&gt; You might be glad you did.  I couldn't find a new fitting locally, so 
welded the 
&gt;   hole up and redrilled it.
&gt;  
Just don't do the dumb-assed thing I did once and reverse the part to shift 
the wear to the other side of the hole.  It looked like it would work either 
way so I thought I could save a little time and a few bucks that way.  
Problem is, the angle is a little off so the cable gets pulled up a little 
causing a bend where the cable goes into the cable end fitting.  After a few 
weeks the cable broke and left me stranded.
