Subject: Re: Mechanical part of Ignition removal 71 Westy

I've had to remove the ignition switch in my '81 Vanagon; in order
to remove it I had to drill a 1/8&quot; hole 1/2&quot; down from the top end
of the switch and 3/8&quot; in from the front edge (you really need a 
picture) and then knock out a pin.  This allows you to withdraw the
mechanism.  

Don't know if it's the same for a '71.  You'll probably need to look
in a manual or, maybe, the replacement swith you'll buy from a FLAPS
will have instructions.

&gt; The actual part that the key goes into.  Mine seems to have frozen and I
&gt; 
&gt; can`t figure out how to get it out.
