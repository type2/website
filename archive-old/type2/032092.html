Subject: Re: [T2] Oil fill tube leaking.

Hi Volks,

In diagnosing the problem with the leaky fill tube, consider the
following:

The plastic oil fill tube fits onto a metal tube that bolts onto the case
with a gasket under it. Midway on the fill tube, there's a wide spot that
the plastic tube fits over (tightly) and is held in place with a springy
loop of wire. You might possibly be leaking from either point.

The dipstick tube is right next to the filler tube. It friction fits into
a flanged hole in the case and is covered by a kind of wimpy little rubber
seal. That seal shouldn't cost more than a couple of bucks to replace. You
could put a small hose clamp over it if it makes you feel more secure. You
could be leaking from there.

Perhaps more likely than anything I've yet mentioned is the possibility
that you have one or more tired rings and you are getting excessive blowby
from your pistons that exceeds the capacity of your oil breather to vent.
When this happens, the bus blows the dipstick tube up a bit and then oil
leaks from the top of the dipstick tube. It happens more when your revving
at high rpm than at idle. The oil then pools at the lowpoint of the rear
tin, drips and gets sucked into the engine fan, and gets slung/blown all
over the inside of the fan housing, and on to the cylinders, and beyond.
Oil gets just about everywhere. If it drips on through and onto the heat
exchangers, you probably will get a lot of white smoke, same as if you had
leaky valve covers.

To determine where you are leaking from, try the following: Clean up all
the oil as well as you can, with rags. Push the dipstick down all the way.
Then fire up the engine and rev while you watch, or go for a short drive
and hop out to inspect. See where the oil is coming from. See if the
dipstick has been blown up at all, see if the dipstick tube is wet with
oil, see where the oil is comingr from.  While revving engine in idle and
parked, see if you're getting exhaust blowing out of the dipstick tube.

I guess it could be the case that you'recrankcase rebreather is plugged
up, either in the breather or in the hose. You could clena it out, but
when I had this problem, that wasn't it.

When I had this problem, I spent a lot of time cleaning out my crankcase
breather hoses, mopping oil, and wringing my hands a lot until I concluded
that, yes, I did nead a top end rebuilt. I rebuilt and that solved the
problem. I had a stuck ring in one cylinder.

This could be a $3 problem (dipstick seal) or a $500-$1200 problem
(rebuild- depending on who does it and how thoroughly). From what you've
told us about oil getting sucked into the fan, I'd guess it's the latter.

Good luck, and don't burn your engine up. Just fix it.

Drive safely,
