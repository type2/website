Subject: Re: [T2] My 77 is a leaker.

&lt;&lt;Then someone before you took that engine out, apart, and put it back
together using type 1 engine screws. I see it all the time.&gt;&gt;

Funny thing here is Karl I bought the Bus from the original owner, it
has 33,280 orginal on it (documented) and the PO told me he never had
any engine work done to it.

From the info I got from him, backed up by the dealer in South Dakota
where it was serviced and orginally bought, I would be inclined to go
along with this.

Everything on the engine was un-hacked, and very original.

Every screw was exactly the same, with a flat washer under it--nothing
was different, all were exactly alike, everywhere.

If this engine was ever apart in it's prior life, somebody fooled the
heck outa me.
And I'm saying this from not only the outside of it, the inside was as
new.

There's more to verify all this, but the evidence isn't only on the
engine--it's everywhere.


 &lt;&lt;You can just about know a type 4 engine has not been screwed with
when you see it still has all its original cheesehead screws.&gt;&gt;

I've seen/used every screw on the block, square headed slotted,
phillips, torx, but I gotta ask ya this----

What in the hell is cheesehead screw?
It come from Wisconsin or somthing like that??

I thought I had all my screw's together here, and you guys pop this one
on me---

Enlighten me.


&lt;&lt; When I see all straight slot screws, I cringe knowing it is a
basketcase inside. Ususally the case says GEX under the tin......&gt;&gt;

Nope --just VW. 

Too much was too perfectly assembled, and undisturbed to be a hack job
from your buddies at GEX, all brought to you live directly up north in
Cheeseheadland.


Hasta,
