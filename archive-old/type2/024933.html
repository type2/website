You have several options around removing your autotranny. But no, you cannot 
remove just the transmission. Your drivetrain consists of 3 parts: 
Engine,Final Drive, &amp; Transmission (in that order)  If you remove all, you 
have quite a job in front of you ( including removing all of your wiring and 
cv joints) and it is quite heavy.  If you remove just the engine...it might 
not just drop down...there is a central AT pump shaft that can get &quot;caught&quot; 
if you don't remove the engine straight back...the result is a bent shaft and 
that's the end of your tranny.  Any way that you seperate the engine from the 
final drive/tranny remember  to replace the Torque Converter Seal and 
Bushing.  If you remove the final drive from the Transmission, there are 
seals and gaskets to replace (check out the microfisch diagrams at you local 
VW flaps ) they are relatively inexpensive and better now than later (believe 
me) and when you join the final drive to the engine they must be joined 
absolutley straight and level or you might damage the seal and not know it 
till it leaks like a sieve when it's all together...I'm in the middle of 
redoing this myself now.  I know this was a long thread  but i hope it 
helps...
Aloha &amp; Good Luck...
