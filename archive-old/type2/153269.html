  begging for help)

Yep, it's a 7 terminal. 39, 36, 6, 9, 8, 7, 27 .

Resistance between 6 and 27 is 2289 ohms.
6 &amp; 9 230 ohms
7 &amp; 8 101 ohms

I forgot to put the air cleaner on the list. It is also new. Does it have a
choke? The vane in the airflow meter works smoothly. I had the cover off and
watched it while the engine was running. I haven't checked the charcoal
canister yet, I'll do that tomorrow. I'll double check the coil wiring
tomorrow. One more thing. Is there some type of manifold pressure on these
guys? I know on newer FI cars.

Thanks for all the help so far guys. I'll get it going yet. Lots of good
info so far.

Yes, there is a temp sensor in the AFM I mentioned
yesterday. To test it, if you have a seven terminal
connector on the AFM, it is terminal 27. Connect
ohmmeter to term 6 &amp; term 27 and at 68 degrees or
above, the resistance should not exceed 2500 ohms.

If it is a six terminal connector, the sensor is built
in to the potentiometer.

Tests: terminals 6&amp;9=100 to 300 ohms;
7&amp;8= 80 to 200 ohms

Other factors like a choke? Plugged air cleaner, the
vane inside the airflow meter stuck (someone mentioned
that earlier - I hope you checked!) Plugged exhaust.
How about some way the charcoal cannister is full of
raw gas and it gets sucked into the engine? I dunno -
but it is, I suppose, a possibility.

All the enrichening is done by either increasing the
fuel pressure when under load (low vacuum) or changing
the dwell of the injectors (the amount of time they
stay open). The wire from the coil to the ECU is the
white wire at the coil that should be connected to
terminal #1 which is where the wire from points /
condensor is connected. The black wire (12V+) is
connected to term #15 coil.

Anything else? -BaH

 I was just thinking. Could it be possible that
 instead of it killing it with
 too much gas maybe its doing the opposite and
 cutting off the air supply
 somehow? I'm afraid my bulk of experience with
 working on FI has been mostly
 with rx7's (owned 5). Is there any type of choke or
 something in the
 throttle body that would restrict airflow until the
 system warms up? I know
 these Bosch units run an air temp sensor in the AFM.
 Does anybody have what
 the specs on this should be?
