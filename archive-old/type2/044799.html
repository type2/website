Subject: [T2] junkyard engine and trany prices

Hey.

    I found a you-pull-it junkyard near me, and they have a 77 bus.  I
pulled some parts from it for my bus, but nothing really major.  Since
then I have been thinking about pulling the engine, and maybe the auto
trany.  The engine is $99 plus $15 core, which I'll have to pay, because
I won't have a core.  The trany is $59 + $15.

    Are these prices good for a 2000 fi and auto trans?  I don't know
much about the automatic, but I'm sure I'd have to pull other things
like the shifter, and all the linkage, and maybe that would add up to
more than I want to spend.  I also want the engine to be mostly
turn-key, so i hope they won't charge me for all the relays and extra
parts on the firewall.

    So, I don't know.  Tell me what you think.  Would you buy it for
that price?

thanks,
