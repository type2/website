Subject: Fwd: [T2] Cool tools

--============_-1191007162==_ma============

Cool tools, indeed! Does anyone have experience with the Color Tune 
tester? Has anyone seen one up close?

It says there is a glass window &quot;in the center&quot; to allow one to view 
the action inside the head. I can't find that window on the photo.  I 
worry that it might be easy to use for a front mounted engine where 
the plugs are vertical and accessible,  but hard to use for a VW 
engine with horizontal plugs buried deep in a cramped engine 
compartment.

Any thoughts?

&gt;I got this link from another list that I am on for my motorcycle, but I
&gt;think some of these tools could also be useful for aircooled VW's.  In
&gt;particular I am interested in checking out the ColorTune test plugs and
&gt;maybe the EZ Bleed system.  I haven't used any of these tools personally,
&gt;but thought other listees might be interested in checking them out...
