Subject: Ride quality

I live in Los Angeles - we have our share of crappy
roads here.  I put KYB GR2's in my '69 Westy and
absolutely love them!  Apparently they're a much
smoother ride than the Gas-a-just, but with the
performance of a gas shock.

I *really* like how that bus handles now, it softens
the bumps, but kind of 'hugs' the road without jarring
me.

But I've just sold my '69 (sniff).. I'll definitely be
buying another set for my '79.

- Randy
