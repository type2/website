Another trick that we use, is to either put some vaseline, or thick grease
on the seal while installing into the head, or to superglue the seal to the
headpipe, in just a couple of places, very sparingly.

Always, Always, Always file the headpipes true with a large flat file before
install, you may save an exhaust leak,.

&gt; &gt;I had a hard time getting the oval copper seals to stay in the right
&gt; &gt;place as I put the manifolds back in the heads.  I think they did not
&gt; &gt;seat correctly.So two questions for you all:
&gt; &gt;First, should I get new copper seals or can I use the old ones?
&gt; &gt;Second, how do I get them to seat correctly?
&gt;
&gt; You should always use new copper gaskets.  Being copper, they get really
hard
&gt; after heat cycling a few times.  The new ones are nice and soft and will
help
&gt; you get a good seal.  Easiest way to get them to stay in place is to smear
some
&gt; thick grease on one side and stick it up into the head.  The grease will
hold
&gt; in place quite nicely while you put the heat exchangers up.  I like to use
NEW
&gt; copper nuts to hold everything in place as well - you can get them from
any VW
&gt; parts dealer.  You should also check them after a few days and snug them
up if
&gt; needed.
