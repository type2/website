&gt; OK, now I have a dumb question.... I am still new to this great adventure of
&gt; Bus ownership. I just assumed my windshield washer pump was bad, but hadn't
&gt; checked yet. I noticed a funny little hose with what appeared to be an air
&gt; valve on it. Does the washer reservoir actually use air pressure?!

yep, however I can't remember the list time I've seen one of em work, I
have a new bottle since mine leaks like a sieve, if this doesn't work I'm
gonna put a aftermarket windshield washer pump on the dang thing
