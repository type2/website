Subject: Farmington Report

Hi,

It has been several years since I attended the Farmington VW parts 
swap/car show. Frankly, I do not really enjoy car shows and the 
Farmington thing had gotten out of hand in the last few years. It was 
expensive, tacky and had less and less to do with VWs.  Last year the 
SEVWA took over the show, ran off the 2fast2furious2silly crowd and 
brought a little dignity back.

I was surprised at the bus showing. There were about 40 transporters 
of various years as well of some other interesting air-cooled VWs. 
Of note was the New Mexico TV repair bus from where else but New 
Mexico, the thing turned somewhat convincingly into a Kubelwagon that 
was complete with &quot;potato mashers &quot; and an MG34 machine gun; and a 
mid 60s crew cab with a walkthru interoir. I am almost positive that 
crew cabs were not available as walkthrus and the owner was not to be 
found so I could not find out any more on that.

Anyway. here are some pics http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~ncbus/farm/

Thanks
Chris
