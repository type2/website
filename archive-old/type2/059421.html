Subject: Oil Cooler Access

Dear List:

Life sux.  Got my carefully rebuilt engine back in my car today (79
california westy).  Began cranking to start it and hear 'the big noise' but
instead got large quantities of oil pumping out somewhere around the oil
cooler.  Its as if there is no seal at all.  Not sure what the problem is
yet, but it looks like the damn cooler has to come out.  Can the oil cooler
be removed/replaced with the engine in the car?  What all has to come off?
Any advice or suggestions is welcome.

Tim Woenker
