Subject: egr

I noticed this bar on the 78 engine I picked up that goes from the throttle 
body area to behind the #4 cylinder.  I looked in the bentley for it, and 
found a picture of it in a blow up of the egr system, but no discription of 
its purpose.  My 79 looks like it has a place for it, but it isn't actually 
there.  Is it bad to not have it?  I don't have the filter or anything that 
attaches to the other side either(for either of the engines) Will I need to 
get this?
Thanks,
Kyle
