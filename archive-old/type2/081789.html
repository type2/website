&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So, unless you have compared an SVDA to a 009, there is no basis for
&gt; &gt; &quot;comparison&quot;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; As it happens, I have had the opportunity to compare these two
distributors
&gt; on the same motor, running the same grade of fuel, same plugs, same
driving
&gt; conditions, etc, etc.
&gt;
&gt; There is NO COMPARISON! While the bus runs with the 009, it doesn't run
&gt; well, just well enough. With the SVDA from Aircooled_dot_net, I have better
&gt; take-offs, more power at high speeds, better hill climbing power, and
gained
&gt; 3 MPG in the city and on the highway. I *think* the motor is running
cooler
&gt; but I have no evidence to support that claim. Once I install my guages and
&gt; develop baseline data, I may put the 009 back in for a time to compare
&gt; readings. (I still carry the 009 as an emergency spare--I know I can make
it
&gt; run well enough to get me home.)
&gt;
