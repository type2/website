Melissa,

&lt;&lt;the fan wasn't hooked up &gt;&gt;
Fan??

&lt;&lt;(and one lever was missing,) &gt;&gt;
used lever $5.00 (OEM)

&lt;&lt;some bushing between the steering column and the gearbox is damaged.&gt;&gt;
new steering column bushing $ 25.45 (WCM)

&lt;&lt;the master cylinder (that i just replaced with a remanuf. one) is leaking
somewhere.&gt;&gt;
check those hoses for sure. especially the one with the plastic clamp from
the res. let me know if you need parts for this.

&lt;&lt;the rear wheel brake cylinder (which i also replaced) is leaking.&gt;&gt;
Did you put a new cylinder with a new boot and cup on? no just the shoes. I
would try and clean it really well and then look at it again after a few
quick stops and see if you can find a leaking cylinder.


&lt;&lt;there is a leak in the exhaust.&gt;&gt;
muffler tape? is this ok by your inspection, if not We have used quality
exhaust parts.

&lt;&lt;and get this...he said that 1 out of 4 side marker lights is
working.  well, as far as i know, the front door markers are solely
reflectors&gt;&gt;
it would be nice if these folks tried to help you rather than just assume
everything is broken. Clean your contacts and replace any questionable
sections of wire. We have rear bulb holders for rear side markers.

i have already removed the rear brake 3 times in this process.  the wheel
cylinders in the rear were brand new.  unfortunately, i tore a hole in the
dust covers in the process of installing the new shoes.  i also pushed the
cylinder past the valve and caused the cylinder to collect fluid in the
dust cover.  i took it apart on sunday because...i was rechecking the
brakes and nothing in there was dry after driving it for 20 miles.  the
pass. side was fine.

&lt;&lt;**what are the main problems related to brake fluid leaking around the
master cylinder?**  i'm hoping i can determine the issues this evening, so
i can order more parts and get them by next week.  the hose from the upper
reservoir to the main container on the master cyl. was old, but i neglected
to replace it.&gt;&gt;

This hose is plastic and not very malleable after a few years. you might
replace it with some standard break line hose from you local parts store. Be
sure to tell them it's for you brakes. That stuff is nasty.

i have no clue as to what the guy is referring to in the steering.  my
better half took the vehicle for the inspection...so no arguements involved
on my part.

I hope this helps
