Subject: Busted for Speeding!

Hi Folks,

I thought you all would get a kick out of this.  Yesterday, I was out for a 
drive in my 1979 Westy, and I got pulled over for speeding!  The officer was 
pretty cool and she said, &quot;I didn't think those things could go that fast!  
When I saw you doing 72 on the radar, I couldn't believe it.&quot;  I was clocked 
doing 72 in a 55 zone, but I'm sure the officer also wanted to pull me over 
to ask about my Bus.

I recently installed a Jake Raby 2.0L FI engine, and I noticed how much more 
powerful it was over my old engine.  I was thinking that it would get me in 
trouble, and I guess I was right.  It was a good check for me, and it was 
also a good check for my speedometer -- it was reading 75 when I passed the 
officer.

Fortunately, I got off with a written warning, but I now have radar 
confirmation and written proof that my Bus will as fast as a &quot;normal&quot; car!

Anybody else have any stories of fast Buses and surprised passengers or 
onlookers?
