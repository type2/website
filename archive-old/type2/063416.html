Subject: Disconnected heater.

When I installed my engine after my partial rebuild (my bus is a '77 westy
with a 2L FI engine) I installed newer heat exchangers but my heater control
valves were shot.  I sort of connected one but the other was left disconnected.
Is this a problem.  I read that having you heaters disconnected can overheat
the engine, but I really don't understand how this works?  Can someone fill
me in?

Once again, I have it set up so one heat exchanger is hooked up &quot;correctly&quot;
to a closed rusty valve.  The other heat exchanger is left open (the pipe
from the heat exchanger to the valve is missing).  Is this causing any
problems?

Thanks,
brett
