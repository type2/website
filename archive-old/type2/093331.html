Subject: Re: [T2] Adding Oxygen Sensor.


&gt;The part number on the ECU is 039 906 021B, which according to ETKA, is the
&gt;correct part number for Federal vehicles, CA' part number is 071-906-021 B. My
&gt;vehicle only had one owner and had less than 50k when I got it so I believe
&gt;that it is original. The harness also stock and no extra connector lying 
&gt;about.
&gt;
&gt;I opened it up at lunch and it is missing the second board (I believe that the
&gt;CA version has two, see
&gt;http://home.swipnet.se/joakim_adolfson/lotus/html/injection-text.html for more
&gt;details). In addition pins 23 and 24 are not connected, though it looks as if
&gt;the circuitry exists to handle input on these pins. I will ask on the DIY-EFI
&gt;group if anyone knows more about adding an oxygen sensor to the federal unit,
&gt;otherwise it looks as if my options are to install Megasquirt or get the 
&gt;CA ECU
&gt;and other components.

I guess I would just build a circuit to monitor the mixture from the 
driver's seat and keep it adjusted.

You certainly could build something but that is far and beyond me.

Time for MEGASQUIRT! &lt;VBG&gt;

In case you are interested Pelican Parts has a free meter circuit for the 
O2 sensor that uses several LED's.


Ciao!
