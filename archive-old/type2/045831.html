Subject: Re: [T2] VW Gas Fired Heaters-Was staying warm

&gt;up......now all that being said the last 412 was the 74 which means they
&gt;are 25+ years old now...after tearing into mine (with shop manual, in
&gt;library) I found that thing had more safety switches and interlocks that
&gt;it was much harder to get it to start than anything else.. .take it

To boot the BA-6 in a late bus or Vanagon makes the BA-4 in the 412
look like a joke safety wise.  I never had the balls to turn on the one
in the '81 but when I bought the '82, after Steve D. berated me endlessly
about being gutless about it (he fired the one in his '80 right up without
even looking at it) I climbed under, looked at the fuel lines, and fired it
up on the next cold morning.  Whirred right into life and makes tons
of prodigious heat, had VW the sense to provide them on all late 70's
buses and then on the Vanagons sold in most of the northern US, they
might not have taken the whipping they were shortly to take.  I've never
got how they rated commonplace in Canada but were deemed uneeded
in the US excepting the brief experiment of putting them on all 411/412's

Anyway, they are wonderful, I too once installed a 412 unit on the '76,
it worked very nicely, I mounted it longitudinally as a BA6 mounts
underneath and used one origional inlet and outlet as the two inlets and
the other inlet and outlet as the outlets to facilitate mounting lenthwise
as it mounted transverse in the 412.  These are really not all that hard to
pick up, and seem in my experience to last much better tucked up there
in a 412 compared to how the bus and Vanagon BA6's rust badly even
under the belley pan in a bus.  They are a bit of a PITA to pull out of
the 412, and getting all the wiring harness intact, fuel pump, coil, etc
can be a major chore which you need to do.  Or just look for one, deals
are out there.
