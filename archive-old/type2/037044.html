sorry for the delay getting back, was off line for a couple days, so if
the questions have been answered, excuse me

&gt; 3)  After a lot of time in the bus using lights, radio, sink, etc.. just
&gt; curious if anyone has any tips on how to install a deep cycle marine
&gt; battery.  Are there any problems associated with this?

Bus Depot has an isolator switch that will link in a second battery that
will do what you want I think

&gt; 4)  For some reason, the previous owner cut a huge hole in the rear engine
&gt; tin.  I'd like to buy and install new tin (black).  However, I have the
&gt; pancake engine (No Doghouse Cooler) and all the advertisements I see are for

hmmmm, I made up a piece until I could find a piece from a donor engine,
the tin is very important on a pancake engine, even maybe more so than an
upright.

&gt; 5) Does anyone know of replacement seats that can be installed on the bus?
&gt; The first 450 miles were ok, but after that the spring was just killing me.

I put Vanagon seats in mine, much better.

&gt; 7) When I turn my key one click (Not engaging the starter) to listen to the
&gt; radio, I hear a rapid clicking sounds from the engine compartment.  I have
&gt; no clue what this sound is, nor if it is bad.  Please help!

the clicking sounds could be the fuel pump, if you have an electric fuel
pump, this should be wired in so that it will only run when the engine is
turning,         BUT this is very important
NEVER leave a vw ignition turned on without running the engine, if the
points are (can't remember open or closed) will cause the coil to overheat
to the point of melting down some of the wiring, and could even catch
fire. (ask me how I know?!)
