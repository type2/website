Subject: Thermostat Help?

Greetings Type 2 fans,

First, I missed the list.  Thanks to the kind and generous folks that
keep the list running!!!!!!

Second, Heating system ( THERMOSTAT) 2000cc motor with FI

Have thermostat, just recieved cable &amp; bracket from Ron _at_TBD (Thanks)

I seem to be missing something to affix the cable to the thermostat, and

something to affix the thermostat to the bracket.  Anyone know what?
Have a picture?  Know  where to purchase them?

Thirdly,  I heard &quot;Scooby&quot;  is involved in creating a wonderful page
showing all the wonderful things that Mr. Bulley(I think he/you is/are
the one) has done to improve heating and sound transmission on a loaf.
Is this true?  And is this page up and ready for viewing?

TIA

Thomas Kulczynski '78 Transporter (camper wannabe)
