Subject: RE: [T2] Running rich when warm issue is back (On my knees 
  begging for  help)

I got a fuel pressure gage from my father-in-law. Tomorrow I'll test the
fuel pressure. Also, I'll pull the had temp sensor and test its resistance.
Along with that I'll warm it up to the point that it shuts off and make sure
I have a good ground. Maybe it was just a bad ground last time.
