Subject: FS:  a/c system from 77

Hey.  I've got the stock or dealer installed airconditioning system out 
of my '77 westy.  It's been kicking around in my garage a while and it 
has to go.  It's complete, but I can't guarantee anything will work.  I 
can guarantee that the fans on the condenser do not spin by hand.  I can 
also guarantee that it will need new rubber hoses and a belt.  There was 
a minimal amount of pressure in the system when i took it out. 

   I can't ship this stuff at all.  But i can bring it with me to the 
June Jitterbug (buses by the falls) on sunday, June 24th. 

   I'd like to get about $50 for the whole thing, but I also really want 
it out of here.  So any one who wants it and is going to the show could 
make me an offer and probably get it.  Or, if you don't have any money, 
but have an extra westy table and L shaped leg that'll fit my 77, it's 
yours, providing you're at the show. 

   Ok then.  Hope to see everyone there...

   ps.  i have to work on a 90 vw golf.  Anyone got one that could help 
a brother with some questions?  I'm doing a head gasket and a starter 
and some other things.  p-mail me....
