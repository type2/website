Subject: Re: [T2] let's overwork the resin guy

Mike,

But look at the price that the folks with pre 68 ones for sale(new).

We used to do a lot of sheet plastic vacu-forming at Volkswagen Product 
Corp. once we had the molds.  Couple of router cuts and bingo, new 
parts...  

Then ask for pmail from folks about how many of us would want a pair at
x price....you might be surprised!

I got a &quot;decent&quot; pair to go on my 78 and the only difference I can see
is that older buses must have used an extra screw along the bottom edge 
that the 78 did not.  I did take the decent pair and fiberglass them on 
the inside so they would continue to hold together for awhile.

The plastic that vw made them out of must not have been UV safe...


Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; How 'bout the rear hatch hinge covers for the baywindows
&gt; &gt; that are NLA? I think they were made out of styrofoam!
&gt; 
&gt; My `77 still has it's covers, but their very, very brittle.  Not impossible
&gt; to cast, but a lot of preparation.  They appear to be made from plastic.
&gt; Giacomo graciously allowed me to remove his for inspection.
&gt; 
&gt; Are these common to other year buses, or specific to each bus?
&gt; 
&gt; Are they truly NLA?  Off the top of my head, I'm looking at about $3500.00
&gt; worth of tooling costs to produce them (to give you something to compare
&gt; with, the long mirror stem tooling costs are around $2950.00).  It takes
&gt; forever to recover tooling costs...
&gt; 
&gt; I'd hate to put that much into them, only to find out that someone else has
&gt; either OEM, repro, or junkyard parts available.
