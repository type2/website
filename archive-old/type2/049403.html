Ya, push until you fill your pants, that sucker probably ain't going in that
easy.  That's when you start a banging.

I was looking through the JC Whitney summer catalog #66J-06 p.37 and came
across this &quot;GARAGE-PRO HOW-TO TIP
The Easy Way to Replace Window Seals on Volkswagen&quot; - &quot;Warm the window seal
before installing the window. Lay it out flat in the sun or some other warm
spot. Install the seal onto the glass, stretching it if ncessary. Insert a
long cord or string in the body grove of the seal. (There should be at least
10&quot; cord overlap inside the groove.)Apply liquid soap (or some other thin
lubricant)to the seal. Now you're ready to install the window.While a friend
pushes on the window from the outside of the car, you pull the string from
the inside. Your friend will have to push harder at the point where your
fiend is pulling out.Pulling the cord will draw the inner lip of the seal
over the window opening. Work your way around the entire opening until the
window is completely installed.&quot;

Hey, were talking JC Whitney here!
