Subject: Which input shaft?

I am putting together the tranny to go into my 74 Camper. This is my set-up:
2L engine, 091 transmission with bellhousing from '74 transmission, 215mm
flywheel and clutch.

The input shaft from the 091 transmission is longer than the one from my old
'74 transmission. Which one should I use?
The short '74 one because I am keeping the '74 bellhousing? Or the long 091
one because I have a 2L engine? Or does it not matter because I have a 2L
engine and either will work?

I have been fighting with a sloppy shifter for quite a while. So far I have
replaced the shifter coupling and the front shifter bushing and I have
installed a quick shift kit - with little improvement. I am about to replace
the bushings inside the shift rod tube. What should I replace inside the
nose cone? The ball joint in the gear selector is an obvisous candidate.
What about the guide sleve and the front bushing in the nose cone? The shift
rod feels pretty tight here - no lateral play. Should I replace these
anyway?

Thanks,
Marcus
