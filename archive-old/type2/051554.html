Hi Derek;

The vent pipe on '70 Westies does come apart by just unscrewing the
connections, but it takes a bit of fiddling.  It's easier if you open the
storage space under the sink, then remove the little panel between the space
and the plumbing.  It just sits in some slots, so you can lift it up and
flex it a bit and it'll come out easily.  This gives you some better view
and access for fiddling with the vent and drain plumbing.  Sometimes
removing the clamshell vent cover on the roof helps a little also, but it's
important to get that reinstalled and sealed properly when you finish so
water doesn't get into the roof assembly and cause some damage.

The black plastic drain pipe has so many variations that you pretty much
have to puzzle out your particular installation.  Some have a glued on elbow
under the bus floor with a screw on cap and a sheet metal support bracket
screwed up into the floor/belly pan.  In some cases these have a threaded
joint up by the sink, so you can remove the support bracket, loosen the
joint, and remove the drain pipe out the bottom.  You have to raise the bus
to make room for the pipe to clear the belly of the bus.  If all the drain
pipe joints are glued you may have to grit your teeth and get out the
hacksaw.  The pipe is standard US spec material, so it's easy to repair or
replace.

Some just came straight down, and may or may not have a cap on the end.
These are the easiest, because once the cap is removed the sink unit can
just be lifted up and out of the bus being careful to not mess up the ice
box and water tank drain tubes/hoses.

Drain the water tank first to lighten the load.  The little T-shaped valve
handle is usually stuck and needs to be persuaded.  Inspect it closely
before you do any forcing  -  I've seen them with both right hand and left
hand threads.  The valve body often turns in the drain tube, so you need to
hold it carefully with some pliers or a clamp while you work the valve stem.
All these plastic bits are old and brittle, so use caution.

There are 2 threaded rods coming through the bulkhead behind the passenger
seat.  Be sure to remove the nuts or wingnuts on these before yanking on the
cabinet.  There's also a little L-bracket at the bottom of the cabinet in
the aisle, screwed into the floor.  With everything else loose, tilt the
cabinet back so the rods clear the bulkhead, then lift it out.  It's awkward
and heavy, so a helper is nice to have available...

The 1970 Westfalia Owners Manual and Campmobile Manual are on the Net.  The
Campmobile Manual has detailed pictures and instructions for R&amp;Ring all the
Westfalia equipment.  Here's a link to that website:

http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/literature/manuals/manuals70westy.htm

Unfortunately, as I've said above, there are a lot of variations in these
installations and you need to remain flexible and observant and not accept
the manual as absolutely definitive.

Have fun :-)

&gt;&gt;  I'm having some trouble with the removal of my sink unit.  More
to the point, the vent tube that goes through the roof of the bus.
I thought it just unscrewed, but now I think it might be cemented
together at the junction underneath the sink top.

Could someone who has done this give me some tips?

There also looks to be the same problem with the curved drain
piece that protrudes from underneath the bus. PVC pipe cemented
together.  What breaks this bond?

FYI I'm doing this so that I can remove the Z-bed so that I can
remove the westy wood driver side panel so that I can treat it
with a water proofer and coat with polyurethane.  I've done this
to several other panels and so far the results are encouraging.
No restoring, just trying to prevent more damage.  &lt;&lt;
