&gt;He said the paper
&gt;towel thing several times, so I'm afraid he's up to something.

&gt;I've found that should it come down to it, I have a really strong
&gt;small-claims court case.. I
&gt;really don't want it to come to that, but I've had enough negative mechanic
&gt;experiences to want to cover myself, not to mention this guy's octane excuse,
&gt;not returning my phone calls, etc.
&gt;
&gt;...weighing a bunch of
&gt;work-shed hours in the cold damp Oregon autumn vs. free work that was
&gt;guaranteed leaves me trying to get him to do the right thing.

If you let him do the work, though, and he decides that it wasn't his fault
(and he clearly intends to decide it wasn't his fault no matter what
happens), he'll present you with a bill, right? And if you don't pay it
he'll have a lien on your bus, which will sit in his yard for a while as a
hostage. Probably he's willing to settle for 50/50, but you're not, because
you're bound to teach him a lesson, a lesson he has never learned yet and
is not interested in cognating.

So you go to the men with guns, and you ask them to solve your problem for
you, and you probably win. You get your bus back. Probably. But here's the
thing, Jon:

This man has proven to you that he is evasive. This man has proven to you
that he will lie if he thinks it's to his advantage to do that. This man
has also proven that he is not much of a mechanic. This man is a hack.

So what makes you think that he is going to do it right when he fixes it
the second time?

You *cannot* repair this man's character. You *might* be able to force him
to repair the bus. But you absolutely *can* repair the bus yourself. Me, I
figure a sure bet beats a hypothesis every time. Time spent arguing with a
liar is irretrievably wasted. Time spent in the shed might be damp, but
it's at least constructive.

For what it's worth, I'm sure others have other opinions.
