&gt;Hello All,
&gt;Thank you to those that replied to my request last week!  Ran close to 500
&gt;miles on brand new engine, and I am Happy to report what I would call a
&gt;successful break-in.  Temps seemed to be incheck, used maybe a quart of oil,
&gt;and ran strong.  One question arises...I am getting some blow by in the
&gt;bypass.. The little rubber finger is blowing some oil.  Any suggestions?

I'd give it another 500 miles for the oil control ring to wear in, then if
I still had the symptom, do a leak down test to determine quality of the
compression rings seal. Find a 5%+ grade. Accellerate under moderate load
through the first two gears, several times. It virtually guarantees the
best ring seating/honing your likely to get. I typically do this first
thing with a new engine. Amazing how the power jumps right up after this
simple procedure. 

Make sure you don't overfill the oil and monitor oil use closely. Write
down the data in your vehicle log.
