Subject: slop in steering
Mime-Version: 1.0

howdy volks!

i drove &quot;meine Rettung&quot; to the shop on Tuesday to get my new tires 
mounted/balanced and get a front end alignment.  i couldn't tell you how 
quick i made friends at the shop, when i told them i had done all of the 
work on it.  the guy that actually did the front alignment wanted to meet 
me after he heard that i was the one that redid the front suspension on 
it.  it is nice to get some respect in an auto shop, being a female and all.

anyway, it feels great with the new tires...Yokohama 185R14 Super 
Vans.  There is a bit of road noise.  I can only assume this is from the 
tires.  I have never driven a bus with the correct tires and new 
suspension, so...i can only assume that this noise is normal.

well...here's the question.  i still have a bit of slop in the steering 
wheel.  is this normal?  the bus rides straight.  i really only notice at 
50 mph and up.  is there anyway to tighten this up?  i have new tie 
rods/ends, steering dampener, ball joints, and drag link.

thanks for all of your help and support.  i'm driving it today to get its 
state inspection.  let's just hope the damn horn works!!
