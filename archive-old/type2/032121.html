Hi, folks--

I checked in a couple of weeks ago with a horror story about a local place
that eyeballed my funny-sounding engine and floated a $3400 rebuild price
past me.  But that's not what I'm writing about tonight:

I'm here to sing the praises of John Muir's Engine Sounds page [available
off the volks_dot_net page at http://www.volks_dot_net/]. I listened to the sound
of tight valves, loose valves, and loose heads, and it was like finding
the Rosetta Stone--finally I understood how to match up what I'd read
on-line and in the manuals with what I was hearing.  [Short version: My
bus noises didn't sound at all like loose heads, which was what the House
Of The $3.4K Rebuild diagnosed.]

There's an old joke, no longer politically correct, that goes like this:
Did you hear about the woman who never knew her husband drank until the
night he came home sober?  Having this bus has been like that for me.  It
was the first bus, first aircoooled, etc., for me, and when I first got
the thing, it was in serious disrepair.  So even after I got it running, I
had no clear idea if I had it running well because I had nothing to
compare it to.  When I first joined this list, I was regularly astonished
--people would write in, reporting they'd fixed this or that condition,
and I would think to myself, whoa, you mean they're not supposed to do
that??  For someone with no real hands-on [or ears-on] experience with
aircooleds [and hence, poor diagnostic skills], the Engine Sounds page is
like the discovery of penicillin: It won't solve every problem, but it's a
quantum leap forward. For those who haven't checked it out, there are
about 20 different diagnostic sounds including [blessedly] an engine
that's simply running right.

So to get back to the other matter, I've re-built the carburetor, re-
adjusted the valves, re-checked the timing, and it certainly sounds and
runs better.  I still have tests to do [like a compression check], and
there are still things I just don't know about the engine because I don't
know its history, but I'm feeling better--on several levels--about the
whole thing than I did a couple of weeks ago.  [Now if I can only get
Joe F. to stop rolling his eyes (not an easy thing to do on email) about
my idea for a scratch-and-sniff diagnostic guide to the different engine
smells and their causes!]

Thanks to volks_dot_net.

best to all
