Hi Tim,

	The Yakima system should work well for use on a pop-top Westy.  Your best
bet would be to use the Side Loader mounts that are made for a fiberglass
pickup cap.  This will require you to drill a few holes thru the fiberglass
top, but it is a safe and secure system that will allow you to raise the
pop-top without removing the rack (you should remove your boat before
raising the top to avoid stressing the hinges).  The full setup with a pair
of Mako Saddles for your kayak should run you about $250.00.
