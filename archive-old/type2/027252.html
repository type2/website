Hi Volks,
   I just came from the type2 library and couldn't find a definative answer 
for my question.  I'm wondering what, if anything, is supposed to secure the 
bottom of the curtains in my 71 westy.  Above the left side windows there is 
an aluminum curtain rod.  Well it's not really shaped like a rod, but what 
else would I call it?  The rear hatch window has this same type of curtain 
rod both above and below the window.  Is that what the side windows should 
have, or was there something else at the bottom?  It seems like a lower 
curtain rod would  hit the top of the table, but I'm not sure.
   Once I find this out I'm going to have my wife teach me to use her sewing 
machine andthen make some new curtains for our bus.  I have some nice fabric 
picked out, and if Kathy says it would be OK to use, I will.  That ought to 
be another learning experience that I will be able to attribute to owning a 
bus.
   As usual, thanks in advance for the help.
