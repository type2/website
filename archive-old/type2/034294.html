&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;   An on going thread about winter gas mileage says;
&gt;       &quot;The reason cars run less efficiently in cold weather is

&gt; &gt;doesn't vaporize as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds right to me, and reminds me of the way fuel lines are coiled
&gt; in
&gt; backpacking stoves to prewarm the fuel on its' way to the ring where
&gt; combustion happens (I'm browning out on the name of it, at the base
&gt; of the
&gt; flame).  I assume that's why VW ran the heat riser along the intake
&gt; manifold.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody got a safe method for warming the fuel just prior to the fuel
&gt; pump?
&gt; I'll bet the truck manufacturers have this one figured out.

&gt; 
&gt; Well in some turbine powered aircraft there is a unit called a
&gt; fuel/oil heat 
&gt; exchanger.  As the name implies heat from the oil is transfered to
&gt; the fuel. 
&gt;   Cools the oil and heats the fuel.  Now those of you with external
&gt; coolers 
&gt; could probably run you fuel and oil lines side by side for the winter
&gt; and 
&gt; them seperate them in summer to prevent vapor lock.

I don't think that warming the fuel is a problem even in the winter.  I
stopped our VW on a chilly day, opened the engine bay and noticed that
the gasoline was vaporizing and bubbling through the transparent
filter.  The fuel line runs along the intake manifold and into a fuel
pump that is attached to the crankcase, both of which warm the fuel.

The main fuel atomization problem occurs when the fuel is drawn into
the venturi of carburator.  The fast-moving air there experiences a
pressure drop and a corresponding temperature drop  of several tens of
degrees.  This can be partially remedied by a properly-operating hot
air tube between the cylinder and the air cleaner (not to be confused
with the heat riser).
