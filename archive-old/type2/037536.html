68 was one-year-only.
It used 67 outside pushbutton handles.
69 and up went to lever action.
68 used the 74 and up lock button on the sill.
69-73 used the second little lever by the inner handle.
Just a little FYI.
[and the hinge bolt change was mid 76.....not at the beginning of 76]
This was in the US.

&gt; &gt;Salutations:
&gt; &gt;I have a '69 Westy that is sadly in need of a driver's door and have not
&gt; &gt;found a replacement and was wondering if later model doors would fit.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Any door from a'68 to '76 should fit as the hinges were the same,although
&gt;  the '74-'76 door has a black locking button on the window sill instead of
&gt;  the older style latch that was located with the door opening lever.
&gt;  So preferably you want to find a '68-'73 door to properly match up.
&gt;  From '77 on the hinge changed significantly and whilst the door was
&gt;  unaltered,the new hinge is completely incompatable with the mounting
&gt;  thingies on the A pillar of a pre-'77 bus/van.
