Just made a quick trip to Colorado Springs this weekend.  Now, need to find out about seals and weather stripping around the pop-top of a 78 Westy.  There was a terrible amount of air coming in around the whole top.  What does one do about this, and where do you find the seals. More about trip later.
Thanks, 
Gail Doles
78 Westy.
