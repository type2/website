Subject: cold start/thermo time debug

Hey list...
  I've been dealing with this problem for quite awhile.  To start my
2.0L FI, I have to give it gas and keep the engine revving or it will
die.  I have to do this the first time I start the bus for 2-5 minutes,
starting around 2500 - 3000 rpms until it will idle.  Once the engine
is warm, this problem goes away.  Sounds like either the cold start
valve or thermo-time switch to me.  Anyone agree with me or have some
other insight.  Can't afford to blindly replace those parts or pay to
have the problem diagnosed and fixed.

Broke in Boulder...
