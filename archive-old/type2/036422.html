Subject: Helping out on the road (Don't shoot, it's Friday :-) )

I can remember a time when people thought you were lower than pond scum if
you *didn't* stop to help someone out (but then I was raised by my
grandmother who thought Queen Victoria was still in power).

I was chit-chatting with the lady who is the cashier in the little hardware
store down the road and we were talking about the lack of trust that seems
to have invaded society like some kind of disease. She finally shrugged her
shoulders and said &quot;I come from a little country, this is a big
country...maybe that's why.&quot; It makes me sad and perplexes me.

Another thing that perplexes me is why is it always the poorest of the poor
who seem to offer to help when things really go south? Is it just because
they feel like they have nothing to lose by trying to help? Man, I wonder
about us.

There have been plenty of people who have been really kind to me in the past
and it's just a form of paying them back to help someone else. I realize
that this can be kind of dangerous on a lonely road, but there's not much
excuse in a crowded parking lot. It ennobles the helper (hey, I can do that)
and the helpee (you're worth helping). It should be practiced regularly
(with common sense, of course) and who knows it might catch on. I hope so.
