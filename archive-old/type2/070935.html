Sounds like you've got the wrong synchro rings there.  I bet
that you've got the rings for a pre-'76 002 transaxle instead of
the post-'76 091 version.   What were the part numbers?  You
need to have #091-311-295As in there.  From your description
you've got a 113-311-269A for first, a 113-311-269B for second,
and a couple of -295Ds for 3rd and 4th.  What brand are these?
Through trial and error I have found that Diehl is the only Brazilian
ring that I will use.  And then I only use them in my Beetle and
early 002 transaxles.  The 091s all get the moly coated Laso
brand from Germany.  

Good luck.
