Subject: Re: [T2] replacing windsheld and rubber together?

--part1_a.16c38d49.293ecea1_boundary

       If your windshield isn't hazed (milky around the edges) and you can 
live with the current amount of pits and wiper marks, reuse it.  As for the 
rubber, West Coast Metric has Cal look rubber (no molding groove) for around 
$18.  As for the rust under the rubber, if your going to farm out the work, 
here's what most body shops will do--if their worth a damn.  Sand blast all 
the rust spots, weld up any holes, mud up any low spots (I myself build up 
any lows with weld and metal finish), shoot it with Variprime (a zinc 
primer), primer surfacer comes next, and finally paint.   A lot of body shops 
now farm out their glass work, so basically come up with money.  The amount 
is going to depend how much rust you have.  Now the hard part, if you get 
your estimates with the windshield in, the shop cannot give you a firm price. 
 The general rule of rust is, you only see about a quarter of it.  Hence the 
price can go up quite a bit once the windshield is removed.  If possible, you 
can pull the windshield yourself and then get your estimates.  It might be a 
chilly drive, but if you want a price that is nailed down, a few bugs in your 
teeth are worth it!!!
                                                                              
Peace,
