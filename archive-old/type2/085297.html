Subject: 73 air injection

Does anyone know what size thread and length could be put into the air
injection port on the 1700 heads. I built this engine from peices and did
not notice the holes until I got  it running and was searching for exhaust
leaks.  I don't want to remove heads to make sure whatever lenght I coose
doesnt interfere with either the valves or impede flow.
