&gt;first off, how cool is it that this guys mom drives a
&gt;westy!   i would just look into what would make it

     Very. Mom introduced me to the Westy, bought hers brand new when I 
was 8. Spent many a summer camping in the bus growing up. Just took my 
Son on his frist camping trip in *my* '78 Westy, and he loved it as much 
as I did. He's 2 1/2, and keeps asking to &quot;go back mountains&quot;. ;-) 
Whatever else one can say about the Westy, IMHO it's the ultimate family 
camping vehicle...


Peace,
