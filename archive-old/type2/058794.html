Volks,

I have a nice 1978 Westy for sale. No rust, new paint-True Blue. 2L FI
engine, runs well. Recently new tires. This is a daily driver. Interior
needs some help, but most pieces are there. Poptop and canvas in good
cond. $1800.00  This Westy turns heads.

Also have a 1981 Vanagon- body is fair, engine does not run, dont know
why, dont have time to deal with it. Has factory air. Bus is complete
and has not been jerked with. $600.00  

I thought I would let the list have first crack at these, next week they
will both go in the local paper.
