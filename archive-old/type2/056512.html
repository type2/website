Subject: Stub axles - are '68-79 and 80-&gt; the same?

As a point of information, and to help Dan Burgos, does anyone know the
answer to the following question:

Are the 'loaf (68-79) and brick (80-&gt;) stub axles the same?  on the one
hand, of course VW changed everything when they went to the vanagon; on
the other, a lot of things stayed the same.  I am thinking that at least
in the early years, the tranny was the same, with differnt shifter
mounting points, the CV's are the same, and I really can't think of a
reason to change the stub axle.  As a result, at least in theory, a '68-79
axle might do the job, and, if so, I can fix him up.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
