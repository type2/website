Subject: Re: [T2] Too many questions?

Well, the response TR wrote about someone being a &quot;List Junkie&quot; 
certainly seemed like an unwarranted attack to me.

Pretty unreasonable behavior, IMHO.

As long as we do stay on topic (LBC - My bad!) I would imagine there 
are no bad questions.

Marks eloquent reports are more than just a casual read, but in them I 
have already found some good intel/info.

If you choose to &quot;zap&quot; a specific person's postings, that is entirely 
your prerogative.

Posting to the list that you consider someone to be a List Junkie is 
just sort of bad netiquette, I feel.

My 2 cents.

&gt; TR What's the problem? I've been subscribed to this list since 11/2002

&gt; have over 40,000 messages in my folder covering just about everything

&gt; related. I don't every post for sure, but I don't recall anyone else
&gt; complaining of &quot;List Junkies&quot; asking questions besides you!?
