Yes, I did forget the filters ;-) I have a stock (well, more or less,
anyway) 1600 and it has no filter and I tend to forget those things.

However, the &quot;fuel&quot; savings from the use of synthetic oil has yet to
be proven, so as I said, it's a moot point anyway.

I'm not saying that I don't believe those claims, but that there is no
empirical data to back them up. If you read the second page (url) that
I sent to the list yesterday, you'd clearly see that.

Personally, I LIKE synthetics. But *why*? It's part gut-instinct and
part falling for the marketing hoopla.

I've done a fair amount of reasearch on the Internet regarding this
subject and cannot find ONE shred of un-biased evidence to support the
claims made by synthetic oil manufacturers. 

Now if they *really* did all those wonderful things, don't you think
there'd be at least SOME empirical data out there????

&gt; &lt;&lt; et's say you drive 12,000 miles per year, your normal
&gt;  fuel-consumption is 15mpg (which is true of my '69 Westy) and gas is
&gt;  at a constant price of $1.00/gallon. Oil changes at every 3,000
miles.
&gt;  Also, figure in that &quot;normal oil consumption for a VW&quot;, per my owners
&gt;  manual, is 1.7-4.8 pints per 1,000 miles; we'll use a quart per 1,000
&gt;  miles for comparison. Again, for the sake of comparison, we'll use
&gt;  $1.85 per quart of regular oil and $4.75 per quart of synthetic.
We'll
&gt;  also say the fuel savings with synthetic is 1.5 mpg.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; i admit you are real close on your math.  except you have omitted two
&gt; important factors.
&gt; you have not included the price of the filters for 4 oil changes
during the
&gt; 12,000 miles.  and synthetics go a MINIMUM of 7500 miles before
being changed.
&gt; some even some of mobil 1s brand are recommended to go 15-25,000 
depending on
&gt; if you purchase their top of the line product or not. next time in
your local
&gt; FLAPS and browse the oil section and see what the recommended oil
change
&gt; frequency is, shoot for that matter i just saw a commercial
yesterday for
&gt; quaker state ( regular oil ) that was claiming to be improved for
*extended
&gt; oil drain frequencies*  for those times youforget to change at 3,4 
even 5000
&gt; miles. so if they can say that about a regular old crappy oil, man
.....any
&gt; synthetic can definitely go 7500 to 15k. (which is what most synthetic
&gt; manufacturers recommend for their own oils anyway. synthetics are by
no means
&gt; needing to be changed at 3000.  and if you do change syn. at 3000, 
the
&gt; savings i mentioned before do not apply.  anyways just something
else to
&gt; consider when figuring this out.
