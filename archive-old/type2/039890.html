Subject: automatic Tranny

Hello wonderful listers,
	My bus life is progressing nicely.  I have a question, though.  How
reliable, easy to maintain, and all that stuff is an automatic transmission.
My body is shot, but the engine is good, and I have found for $350 a very
solid, rust free '73 westy body with no engine.  It does have an auto tranny
that has good clean fluid and seems like it would work correctly, but I know
nothing about them.
	What I want to do is fix the worst of the structural rust problems on
Nanook, put the old pop-top back on (easy to do) and sell it, in favor of
this new beautiful camper.  It is a westy, but I think I'll put my
sportsmobile top on (flame suit securely worn here), because I don't really
like those old Westy tops as well as the Sporstmobile Penthouse that I have.
That, and the Vanagon camping interior will make this a fun bus!
	As you can tell, I am very excited about this new bus prospect, because the
body work on the other bus would have been daunting, frustrating, expensive,
and not a lot of fun.  I would like to go camping this summer, not spend my
free time behind a welding mask.
	So, I have come full circle.  Please help me understand the peculiarities
of the automatic transmission so I know what to look for when installing the
engine, etc.
