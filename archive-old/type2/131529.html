Subject: VW Tool Schematics, Oil Pressure Relief Tool

Richard,

I tried the link on your page for the VW Tool Schematic and I can't seem to 
get it to work. Do you have it somewhere else? I am looking at gear removal 
tools and that tool for the slotted plug over the oil pressure relief valve.

Anybody elses have these out there in Type II land?


Thanks,

Michael Knight
