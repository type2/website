&gt;I took it down to the local VW expert and he said I probably have a

&gt;the whole head and he said he'd have to grind down the old head and that's

Shouldn't be quite as expensive, but probably close.  The main problem with
this is that the replacement head might not match the one on the other
side.  I'd have the old one rebuilt for this reason alone.

&gt;He also offered (since the mileage on this engine is unknown) to replace
&gt;the entire engine for a new one for $2000 ($1600 parts/$400 labor).

That's not too bad, if it's a decent rebuilt.  Hopefully he sells AVP.

&gt;In light of the decent compression on one side and the poor compression
&gt;on the other, would it be better to fix only the bad side or would I be
&gt;better off in the long tem with a new engine?

You'd almost certainly be better off with the rebuilt engine, but that's
expensive.  The compression isn't too high on any of the cylinders so the
rebuilt engine might end up being worth the money, but you might also
consider having both heads rebuilt and put back on instead, if it can be
determined that the short block is in good shape.  That should be about
half the price of the rebuilt engine and you'd be replacing the most
trouble-prone parts.

&gt;Or is this mechanic pulling my leg?

No, what he's saying doesn't sound too far off to me.
