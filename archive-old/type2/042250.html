Hey Ben,
Did you recheck your timing.  I pulled out my distributor, flipped the
drive dog, and then put the distributor back in the *exact* same
position, and the timing was advanced 24 degrees at idle(I finally heard
what pinging was).  I'm glad I checked this because I could have killed
my engine!

So, the plastic shouldn't have caused *too* many problems unless it got
into the working parts of your distributor.  Get the new parts, make
sure that the advances are working correctly(vacuum and mechanical) and
make sure your timing's correct.

Later,
Mike

&gt; 
&gt;  I'm seeking the answers to two puzzling questions and also wish to publish
&gt;  my mistakes so that others may benefit.  Last weekend I did a complete
&gt;  tune-up on &quot;Emily&quot;...took the stock distributor completely out so that I
&gt;  could get at that ridiculous screw that holds the condensor plug on.
&gt; Gapped
&gt;  the points, lined everything up correctly (I think) and put the distributor
&gt;  back in, made sure the dwell was correct, and timed the engine.  The timing
&gt;  mark was steady at 7.5 deg. but I noticed that the distributor cap wouldn't
&gt;  seat correctly and touching it changed the timing slightly.  Well, to make
&gt; a
&gt;  short story long, I had put the cap on backwards and when I popped the cap
&gt;  off there were little plastic shavings on the rotor that had been gouged
&gt; out
&gt;  of the cap.  I flipped the cap around and switched the wires around and
&gt; when
&gt;  I went to re-time the engine the mark jumped around a little and the engine
&gt;  runs like crap.  It must also be running hotter than normal since I've
&gt;  noticed a little oil usage over short distances.  How would you
&gt; troubleshoot
&gt;  this situation?  The first step is to get another cap and rotor but I don't
&gt;  think that explains the difference in performance.  Also, why must the
&gt;  engine always be rotated in the clockwise direction with the generator nut?
&gt;  I admit I rotated it a few degrees counterclockwise before I read that
&gt;  statement.
&gt; 
&gt;  Thanks as always,
&gt;
