Subject: Re: [T2] Re: 72 bus on the samba

&gt;That's what I thought when I bought my bench-seat 65, but I can clamber
&gt;over it into the back without much difficulty and I'm neither petite nor a
&gt;contortionist.  Are bench bays worse?

I used to be able to kick a leg over the bench and into the back, but since 
I mounted the A/C unit overhead between the cab and passenger compartments, 
this little feat is no longer feasable.
