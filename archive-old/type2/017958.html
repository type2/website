Message-ID: &lt;373743B1.54A613D2_at_psalmrecords_dot_com&gt;

yeah, rasdave checkin in here. friend has a his 63 crewcab apart and i
was checking out the gas tank area down there behind the passanger
bench....ALOT of room down there! has anyone thought about putting a
bigger tank down there? has anyone done it? what about on a non-crewcab
like my 74 bus... is there more room where we can put something bigger?

on this 63 crewcab.....there has got to be at least a foot of space on
either side, maybe a 6 inches to a foot behind the tank, and maybe a
foot to a foot and a half  in front of the tank.
