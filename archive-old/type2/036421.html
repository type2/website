Subject: dealer's bus repair manual ('74-'78)

Volks,

Perhaps I haven't sufficiently advertized the scans from the *dealer's only*
repair manual (found at http://www.simplecom_dot_net/dakhlia/bus-stuff/). For
now you'll find info on:

Lifting vehicle with hoist / floor jack ; Towing
Rear Wheel Suspension / Shafts and Axle
    (Removing and installing wheel bearings)
    (Repairing rear axle)
    (Removing diagonal arm with spring plate and torsion bar: Adjusting
torsion bar)
    (Repairing drive shaft; Removing and installing C.V. joint)
    (Dismantling and assembling C.V. joint)
Wheel Alignment
Checking Fuel Gauge and Voltage Stabilizer
Heater Booster BA6

Don't thank me; thank Unca' Joel (Walker)! He gave me the book!

Sami
