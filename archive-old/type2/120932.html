Subject: Re: [T2] Rear-end Howling and Growling resolved....(whew!)

I thought it was peculiar that the nut had come loose as well (has me 
worried that I've got other nuts coming loose elsewhere).  That cotter 
pin probably had a lot to do with keeping the nut in place...never will 
I be running around without those things installed.

As for the bearing going bad...I'll keep an eye on it, and check these 
axle nuts from time to time.  Hopefully I won't have to tear into that 
PITA for a while.

Enjoy,

Jonathan

&gt;If that nut was properly torqued then you probably have a rear bearing
&gt;problem.  Do check the torque again regularly for the next couple of
&gt;months as it will probably loosen up again.  DO KEEP A NEW COTTER PIN IN
&gt;THAT NUT!  I believe that those cotter pins have saved any number of lives
&gt;without anyone knowing their life was saved by it.
