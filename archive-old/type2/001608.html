Just got back from the Spring Meet at Kelley Park.  A nice event put on by
the friendly people of the Golden Gate VVCA.

Seeming hundreds of Beetles in 5 classes.  Almost as many split window
busses, separated into working and luxury classes.  (I am almost tired of 21
window 9 seaters.)  Ghias,  Notchbacks.

Only two T2's though.

My son took 2nd place with his 71 Dormobile.  Everybody who stopped by loved
seeing it.

Where do late model busses show up in the SF bay area?  We would have liked
some company.


Lloyd
