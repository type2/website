Subject: Engine Runs Hot
Message-ID: &lt;382B7358.BBD71D5_at_erols_dot_com&gt;

Help,
I have a 70 Bus with a 1776 engine. I bought the engine new 1200 miles
ago. Everything was going fine until recently when the engine started
running extremely hot. I'm talking so hot you couldn't touch the
dipstick. I had dual Delordo carbs on it. They got out of sync and I
could never seem to get them back in sync. I took the Delordos off and
put on a single carb which I rejetted to 135mm (still runs hot),
adjusted and readjusted the vales(still runs hot), tuned it up changed
the plugs(still runs hot) checked the thermostat ,it's good (still runs
hot) I have tried everything I know. My mechanic couldn't find anything
wrong or out of sync. He suggested an external oil cooler and an oil
sump. I just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything else I could
check before I put on the sump and oil cooler. Seems to run hotter at
highway speeds than locally. Any advice would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Sharon
