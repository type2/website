Subject: Re: [T2] Alcohol and Driving

Years ago (1960) I raced inboard hydroplanes and all boats in our region
ran Alcohol. The reason was simple Boat/Water, alcohol dilutes with water
= no fire!
It was a simple matter of proper fuel pressure and Carb jetting to get
very high performance out of our engines. Ten thousand RPMs were possible
but the normal was about 6-8 K RPM.
These were racing engines but it was not uncommon to get two or three six
month racing seasons out of an engine. That relates to about 50 Indy
Races in hours.
Unless you have a dynomometer you're just beating your brains out on this
project but It is definately worth persuing if you happen to have 100,000
acres of corn that you can distill.

&gt; It's not what it sounds like! Just a hypothetical question for the 
&gt; list:
&gt; 
&gt; Would it be possible to convert an air-cooled VW engine to run on 
&gt; 100%
&gt; ethanol? If it is possible, what would be involved? Would it work on 
&gt; carbs
&gt; or fuel injection, or both maybe? Change valve sizes, material,
&gt; lift/duartion, CR?  Hotter spark plugs? Anything else come to mind? 
&gt; Let's
&gt; assume that the supply of ethanol isn't a problem and that we're 
&gt; talking
&gt; about a small fleet, not a single vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not looking for guaranteed info here, just educated guesses. 
&gt; This info
&gt; isn't for a real-world project, but rather a fictional one.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
