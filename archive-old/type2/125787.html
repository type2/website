Subject: RE: [T2] Greetings and my first question...or two.

Thanks for all the help, everyone.  Thanks to a member that emailed me
off the list, I may have traced the problem to the #2 temp sensor on the
left head, specifically the wire to the sensor was nearly broken and
finally did break as I was checking it.  Would make sense if the sensor
would intermittently have a good connection the problem would go away
since I guess this sensor supplies ground for the computer as well.  Bad
ground, BAD GROUND!  No cookie.
