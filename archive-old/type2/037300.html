Subject: door handle breaky breaky

Last night I went out to the van, which has been behaving
very well since I put a new starter on it, to move it clear
to the other side of the street.
 
I put my key into the door handle, turn the key, pull the lever,
hear a pop, and the door doesn't open.
 
apparently some internals have broken.  It looks like
I need to take off the inside of the door to get in there.
 
I only ask because I made the mistake of taking *way* too much
stuff off my Vanagon when I was messing with the door locks,
and I don't want to make nay more work for myself on the Loaf
if I can help it...


anyone care to share what I can expect to find inside?


thanks much

matt
