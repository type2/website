My local lumberyard carries 1/8&quot; birch plywood.  I've been cutting replacement
panels from that.

&gt; Good morning from Cali.
&gt;
&gt; ...   I've been able to salvage all of the wooden trim, except for the very
&gt; large piece
&gt; covering the area over the driver and passenger seats, with the dome light.
&gt;   I've looked in all the catalogs, but this part does not seem to be
&gt; available...  Any ideas where I may obtain this?   I'm also looking for
&gt; recommendations for places that sell attractive veneers.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt;
&gt; Jason
&gt;
&gt; P.S.   For everyone that responded about the stuck doors, thanks!   Liquid
&gt; Wrench and an impact wrench works wonders.  And I only hit my hand with the
&gt; BFH once!
