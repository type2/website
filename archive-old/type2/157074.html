Subject: Re: [T2] 78 engine / 091 tranny -&gt; 72?

&gt; hey volks.  
&gt;I was hoping the list had some advice about swapping in a '78
engine... into a '72.

I've read Richard's FAQ (http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/FAQ.html -
4.1)since sending this, and it got me wondering if mating a '78 engine
to the original 002 transmission would be feasible.  I thought this was
a big no-no, but could the flywheel from the 1700 go onto a 2L to allow
a fit?  The FAQ doesn't explicitly say &quot;no don't do that&quot;, nor does it
say &quot;do that&quot;, so I ask you folks.  Sounds reasonable, but lots of
things sound reasonable right before they sound stupid :)
Thanks in advance--
