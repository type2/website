Hey,
Anyone out there in Type2 land want to come over and help me install the
engine in my Karmann Ghia?  Preferably someone with a hydraulic jack or I
will have to go out and buy one ;-)

I've got the long block together (did all that yesterday) so now it's just a
matter of mounting the accessories and installing it.  I'd like to do it
this Saturday, if possible.  I anticipate it being ready by then.

As my signature says, I live in Fairfax, VA.  Any help will be greatly
appreciated.  I can supply beer if desired :-)

Thanks in advance!
