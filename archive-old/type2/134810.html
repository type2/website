Subject: Re: [T2] Definitely a Friday topic

Although I have more than 50 of his cd's and much prefer the majority of the 
songs that weren't hits...you should also consider  &quot;On the Road Again&quot; by 
Willie Nelson (a song he wrote on an airplane in 5 minutes for one of his 
movies).

Have a good weekend all,
