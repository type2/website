Subject: Phone number for Steve Sandlin

I'm trying to get my locks all rekeyed ASAP and so far Steve's the only one
that says he can do it (and for a very reasonable price too).  Anybody have
a phone number so I can get in touch with him soon.  I want to try and ship
the locks overnight priority to him today if possible.

Thanks,
Dan

PS  The locks are the only thing holding me up on leaving for a six month
stay in Yosemite and I'm already a month overdue :(
