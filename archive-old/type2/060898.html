Subject: oil on ground

Fellow Listees,
A friend of mine experienced  the bad sensation of blowing out all of
her oil at one time. It came out the left side above the valve cover,
all over the tire. She had just changed the oil a day or so before, this
happened at about 3AM. Operation: Save Sandy has officially started,
some freinds are going to be going to take a look at whats going on with
it. BTW Sandy is a 79 Westy. Any suggustions on what happened please let
me know. Thanks, Mike. 73 Westy
