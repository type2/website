Subject: welding heads

I have a pair of heads off of my 1700, and it has some funky lloking posts 
sticking out just above the spark plugs, but nothing connected to them or 
around. Can these be pulled out and the holes welded shut, because they are 
leaking air or something. Also are the heads aluminum and has anyone welded 
them before. Tips..
