Subject: New look for &quot;Bob the Tomato&quot;

Hi Volks,

This past weekend I attended the &quot;Campin at Da Caves&quot; campout at the  
Warsaw Caves just NE of Peterborough Ontario. Since the theme this  
weekend was the movie &quot;Cars&quot;, I decided to dress up my bus to blend in.

When I applied the vinyl on Wednesday  I wasn't sure if it was going  
to be permanent or not, but since then the look has taken hold so I  
think I'm gonna keep it a while, at least until the next re-paint. Or  
until I get a letter from Herr Maus's attourneys.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
