      You really shouldn't be messing about with electrical wiring
without at least a simple multimeter. Hey, they're cheap. Much cheaper
than frying some expensive component because you wired it backwards.
$10-$20 will get it, less at a garage sale. You also need one to check
for shorts, whether a fuse is actually any good, etc.
