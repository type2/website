Subject: Failed Emissions (but got a *valid* test! :-)

Volks,

OK, round 2 in the emissions wars.  I took it back up, and at least it
idled well enough that a valid test was performed.  Now... I can either
take it to a certified facility and get it repaired, spend $300, and get a
waiver, or... I can actually fix it :-)  I would perefer to actually fix
the damn thing if I can.

Results of the test:
             Idle                       2500RPM
        Limit    Reading  result    Limit    Reading  Result
HC ppm   600      1961    Fail       600      161     Pass
CO %     6.00     8.32    Fail       6.00     6.11    Fail
        RPM        983    VALID     RPM       2494    VALID 
        Dilution  16.2    VALID     Dilution  16.7    VALID

Now, the main querstion is &quot;What's wrong???&quot;  I *think* it is running rich
as all get out (but see the last paragraph).  I can twist the AFM's tail
to lean it a bit, but I have a feeling that one cylinder is not firing too
well.

So far I have set the dwell and timing, and cleaned up some vac leaks.
Also set the idle speed and checked compression (which is fine)

I just got my intake boots and will install them and the new runner to
head gaskets today.  I then intend to replace the spark plug wires, spark
plugs (to take care of any possible failure in the wires/plugs).  What
else?  I can check and adjust the AFM a bit, but I don't think I will get
a 2/3rd reduction in HC at idle with only that.  

Also, what the heck are the HC and CO measuring?  HC is hydrocarbons,
which is unburned gas and says I am running rich, but CO is carbon
monoxide, which would seem to indicate that I need more oxygen i.e. I am
running too lean.  It can't be both!!!!
