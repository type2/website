Subject: Re: [T2] Fuses

Beth,

I may be missing it, but looking at the schematic, I can't find any fuse 
that would keep your van from starting. If anyone knows of one let me know.

You can test fuses by measuring the resistance with a VOM (volt ohm meter). 
It is a simple test and should be described in the operation instructions 
that come with the meter.

Low cost VOMs (less than $20) work just fine for this and many other 
troubleshooting measurements on your van.

&gt;OK, van's not starting.  It's been suggested to replace fuses even though 
&gt;they look &quot;good&quot;.  This has been successful for me before, replacing a fuse 
&gt;that looked good, thereby solving a problem.
&gt;
&gt;So my question is this:  how do you tell a good fuse from a bad fuse?  I 
&gt;pulled out my little metal &quot;Sucrets&quot; box of new fuses, and even those 
&gt;looked kind of oxidized.  Is that bad?  Does it matter?  Is there a way to 
&gt;test fuses so you know they are good?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the help.  By the way, '78 Westy 2.0L with fuel injection.
