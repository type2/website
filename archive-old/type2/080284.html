Subject: 2-liter requires repeated starts until warm

Sorry, but I better add that I am on the digest, so I'd appreciate a carbon 
copy to my &lt;Doyt_at_buckeye-express_dot_com&gt; address, if you do reply to the list.
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.
OK, I'm having problems with a freshly overhauled 2-liter engine in my 76 
Westy. Everything is stock.....fuel injected, no carbs.

The engine starts and idles for about 8 seconds and stalls. Pressing on the 
accelerator during this 8 seconds kills the engine instantly. I can 
immediately restart and get another 8 second idle, if I don't touch the 
accelerator.

If I repeat the &quot;restart, let idle and eventually stall&quot;  5 or 6 times, the 
engine becomes warm enough to continue idling on its own.

After it is idling on its own, I can operate the accelerator and drive the 
bus around the shop.
I haven't had it out on the road yet. I want to get this &quot;stalling until 
warm&quot; condition resolved first. Or at least I want to understand the condition.

I checked for electrical pulses to the individual injectors during the 8 
second idle, and the injectors are receiving impulses.

Of course, I would like to have this engine run right away, without the 
repeated restarts. But maybe this is just a phase I have to live through, 
until it gets worn in enough to continue running. This is my first 
overhaul, and I don't know where to go with this problem.

Perhaps someone among you can review these behaviors and make some 
suggestions that will help me get my bus back into service. I'm listening.
