Subject: Re: [T2] Hard BRAKES!!

&gt;Hey listies, I have a question about my brakes. I just got the 72 on the
&gt;road , but the brakes are a bit iffy . The pedal is really hard. I have to
&gt;put a lot of my 200lbs on it to stop. It did help after I put new calipers
&gt;and front pads on, now the rear brakes are pretty far out of adjustment,
&gt;would this cause the problem? Also which way do the stars turn to adjust the
&gt;rear brakes in? I did notice that there real hard the first 50% of the pedal
&gt;the they start to feel the way I would like them to , after I put the new
&gt;calipers, pads and bleed them.

If you have rear brakes far enough out of adjustment it could be that you 
are trying to stop with fronts only. Also (though i doubt this is the case 
this time) always looked for rock ding-ed brake lines that restrict the 
flow to the rear or the vehicle. I had a Fiat with that problem. Took 
FOREVER to figure that one out.

I adjust and bleed my brakes per Muir.

Seems like our Toyota way back in the early 80's had a bad proportion valve 
in the brakes. Do the 72's have proportioning valves?

Stuck caliper that is forcing you to push extra hard to make up for the 
lack of brakes?

Brake pads in backwards?

Grease on the rotors or drums?

Basically are you loosing the hydrualic pressure due to a ballooning rubber 
brake line or is the pressure restricted due to a bent or pinched metal 
line or is there a grease on the pads?
