Hi all!

I've got some questions that're likely to stir up some debate. (I know 
you've all been waiting for something since the Bus Depot Wars seem to be 
over! ;-} ) I've the Muir book and at first I thought it was great. But I've 
been dredging through the archives and now I'm beginning to wonder. I have  
subjects that are bothering me and I'd like some opinions:

   1. Timing. Muir says static timing is the best but I've read/heard alot 
of dissent.

   2. Distributors. Muir says mechanical (009) is best. My problem here is 
my bus has a 009 and I thought I was lucky that the PO had already put one 
in for me. Now I'm beginning to wonder.

   3. Warming up. Muir says warm up before you drive. Others disagree.

The book seems to be a great how-to guide for the various repairs discussed 
but I'm beginning to think that the things that are Muir's opinion need to 
be taken with a grain (or two) of salt. what's the verdict?

TIA
