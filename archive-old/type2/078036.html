&gt;Okay,
&gt;
&gt;Here's the situation.  I just bought a 78 Van 
  It ran for about 10 seconds, shut down and then
&gt;would not fire again.  When I cranked it, it would
&gt;almost catch, but not quite.  
&gt; I do have spark, and I
&gt;would assume fuel.....Hmmm!
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

You can't assume anything, you must verify. Mechanicals first (valve
adjust/compression/leakdown). Check intake air duct and all vaccuum and
other hoses hooked into the intake and stop any leaks. Then verify that
spark at the plugs is HOT. If not sort out the ignition. Then address the
fuel system. Pull the fuel filter. Pour the fuel out the inlet end. Blow
through the filter. There should be very little resistance once you get the
gas blown out. Renew or replace it. Then verify fuel pressure. Note that if
the fuel pump is making any noises other than a very smooth hum, it's been
stressed and could be a problem very soon even if it is still putting out
spec pressure and volume. 

Once all that is verified and you still have a problem, only then begin
testing the vaious components that feed info to the FI computer, the ECM.

There are quite a number of things that can cause your symptom. Follow
Bentley in order. Note that engine comes first, then ignition, then fuel
system. It comes in that order for the very specific reason that you will
not miss the culprit/s if you skip no steps. Any step skipped might in fact
miss the malfactor and lead to much further work (time/money) and poor/no
results.
