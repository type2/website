Subject: RE: [Syncro] New found AC Refrigerant

Dennis--
Actualy the sealer is a lubricant prior to anything leaking--
It is not Bars leak---Or Seal a Meal.

Fact--

My AC is blowing colder than it did last year with a full load of R-12.

Fact--

Methane is not propane

Fact--

Methane is not Butane

Fact--

My AC after a trip of 12 miles _at_ 65 mph is putting out 36 to 38
degree's, on the way to work today, at 80 degree's outside temperature,
via both my digital, and manual AC temperature vent gauges

Fact--

In 4 weeks time, my system has leaked NOTHING, and still maintains the
pressure's I had at the time of installation.

And for the record--I'm an R-12 kinda guy---I like the real
thing--regardless.
I like the stuff my AC system was designed for--

Remember this---134 has an A behind it--
It is an alternative and requires bigger head temps to operate
efficiantly.
This would be a good time for all the soothsayer's of doom and gloom to
charge their old Ac systems up with 134--to find all the weak spots in
their AC components and seals--

The reason I went with this stuff--it's compatable with all--and runs
with 35% less product--less head pressures on the compressor--easier on
everything in the system.

For now it's running at least 8 to 9 degree's colder than the
R-12--after 4 weeks.

The back of my neck is freezing--
Yeowza--!!

I'll keep everyone abreast of the long term results--stay tuned--

Later,

Terry

Methane Based! Sounds Flammable to me. Sealers in the AC system, wait a
year. Clogs just like the radiators and heater cores. I'll check it
though. Thanks for passing this on.

Hey All--
  I have been fighting off the known dismal change to the R 134-A
for years, in my vehicles, as well as at work in customer's trucks.
The simplest reason is that it just is not an efficient
refrigerant--period.
And I personally don't care for the higher head pressures it requires to
half assed function ---it will never replace R-12--in the cooling
department.
And Propane, or Butane products are totally out of the question--no way
Jose--bad stuff--
However, I have found this off the wall product--and being the
adventurous type---I order two 6 oz. cans of this refrigerant, and a 6
oz. can of their sealer-- I was reading about in an automotive
publication I get---
It's called Red Tech--and it is a methane derivative--with some other
who know's what ingredients--
I drop a a can of the sealer into the 87--( it has an ever so slow
leak--once a year --you'd play hell finding it type ) and then drop a
can of the refrigerant into it--that's all--( the stuff at 6 oz. does
the same thing as 18 oz. of R-12, and 16 oz. of R-134a )
The temp at the vents is now 39 degree's--at 50 mph--or with a fan in
front of the condenser, while testing--
The sealer allegedly plugs nothing until a leak appears--and then it
seeks moisture--at that area.
Until then it just lubricates the system--
It is totally compatible with 12--and mineral oil-- It is totally
compatible with 134 and ester oil.
I've had the stuff in my Van now for 4 weeks and it has never blown this
cold out of the AC vents--even with the 12---I am impressed.
The craziest thing is they don't want you to pull a full vacuum on the
system--the stuff is supposed to be dropped into the low pressure side
at zero--not 28 or 30.
The instructions say that the refrigerant works best this way--because
it expands--
and it also disperses moisture in the system-- and if it released into
the atmosphere-it turns into carbon dioxide-- go figure--it's a friendly
item for the greenpeace folks--
Anyway--I know the summer months are are around the corner--and I can
see the influx of AC questions and comments coming--
Here is an excellent, reasonable R-12 alternative that I have found--and
tried-
Works good. ( and very cold )
Later,
