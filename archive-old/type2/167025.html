We've been round and round on this. Dynamat is really the best solution.

It's tempting to try to do something when your bus is stripped down,  
but if you're not made of money, the way to do it is to make rolling  
improvements, a little each month for, say, a year. You don't need to  
cover every inch to have an effect.
