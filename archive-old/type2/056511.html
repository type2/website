Subject: Used parts wanted for '81 Westy

Hello everyone,

If anyone is parting out their vehicle or has any of the parts I need,
please contact me.  TIA.
I'm looking for an axle stub for my '81 Westy.

Just want to clarify...I don't need the drive-shaft axle, I only need the
axle stub...it's the piece that connects at the outer CV joint on one end
and attaches to the road wheel via the axle nut on the other end.
BTW, this is for the rear passenger side of a '81 Vanagon L Camper Deluxe
Westfalia, 4-speed manual transmission.

There are some other parts that I am also looking for:

clip, sun visor, right (not the swiveling part for the visor)
bumper, preferably chrome, rear
lock, rear hatch lid, black, preferably with key
end cap bumpers, rear
CV joint protective cap
brake backing plate, rear, right
speedometer
refrigerator
sink faucet knob
propane tank
vinyl panel for inside of sliding door

Thanks for your help!
