Subject: &quot;rubber squares&quot; was re alignment

&gt;On reflection the 'rubber square' may be the collapsable part of the
&gt;collapseable steering column
And *check* those little buggers from time to time! They dry, crack,  wear
out and BREAK! NOT a good
thing to happen, as a few Listies pointed out some weeks ago.
