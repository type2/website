Subject: Need Odometer help

hi.

I've been having problems getting my odometer to work on my 76 westy. my
speedometer works fine. in an effort to find the source of the problem, I
first pulled the instrument cluster and checked all the leads. failing to
see anything wrong, I went to the junk yard and pulled another cluster and
brought the thing home. I once again pulled the instrument cluster and this
time swapped the old speedo for the new(er) one. I put everything back in
place and went for a ride. lo and behold, the new speedometer worked, but no
movement from the odometer.

I don't know what else it could be. is there any crucial part of the
speedometer/odometer that could be missing or preventing my odometer from
turning? has anyone else had this problem?

many thanks,
pete
