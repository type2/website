 So here we are 2 somewhat knowledgeable
&gt;VW enthusists trying for 3 hours to get the old starter out. Got the bottom
&gt;bolt out no problem but the top bolt has a small phlange surrounding the
&gt;bolt head so we could only get a small bit of the wrench around it. Tried
&gt;like crazy to yank that bolt out but no luck. We had to hang our heads in
&gt;shame and walk away. 

Remove the throttle body &amp; right intake pipes and knock it out with a big
drift and substantial hammer. The bolt head is semi-round and semi-square.
If the upper bolt is not oriented properly, it can get wedged in super
tight. A point of a square will jamb against the motor housing if not
oriented with the flat toward the milled flat of the housing, which is
there for that purpose.

The upper bolt and starter must be installed together. If you put in the
starter and tighten the lower nut, the upper bolt cannot be properly
installed. Not knowing this, some doityourselfers will force it in, both
bending the bolt and missorienting the head, then follow up with the
precisely required and mandatory overtorquing. A very common error of all
newbies who proceed without a mentor who's been there and done that before.
