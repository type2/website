&gt;&gt; it might be a hole for some sort of aftermarket breather.
&gt;
&gt; It's a popular place to secure the VDO oil pressure sender with a clamp
&gt; although the hole looks a little larger. I can't really tell from that
&gt; photo.

Well... no oil comes near that hole, as far as I can tell.  I misspoke 
when I said &quot;crankcase&quot;.  I believe it's really the fan housing (note 
it's directly behind where the coil mounts, which is on the fan 
housing, right?).

Several people have suggested that I should just plug it.  What's the 
best thing to use to do that?  Cork + permatex?
