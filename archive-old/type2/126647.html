Subject: Re: [T2] Bosch Platinum

IIRC, the only real benefit aside from profits for the manufacturer,
was longer plug life. Right?

Soooo... Do we, as bus owners who have to do real work on a regular
basis, really need to skip the annual plug replacement?

I used platinums exactly once. On my 76 280z. Thing ran no better, and
was actually worse when the engine was running hot for whatever
reason. Probably my 19 year old driving habits. LoL! Plugs fouled
quickly when sitting in traffic too. Replaced with ND cheapies and no
more fouling and better hot conditions performance.
