Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line size

 
From: &quot;John Hartranft&quot; &lt;jhartan_at_tir_dot_com&gt;
 
&gt; Holy schmokes, Mr. Gates!  No doubt our friends who emptied the coffers at
&gt; Chrysler will be glad to sell you the fuel line by the meter full, but I
&gt; bought it by the foot from a little hole in the wall foreign car parts store
&gt; here in Flint (home of GM, no less) for a whole lot less than that.  I'd
&gt; shop around a little, just stick to German or foreigh car part shops and
&gt; make sure you get the metric, not the American standard, hose.

Where on a 71 did you put 10mm FUEL HOSE????

A 71 uses 5mm fuel hose.

We are talking about inside diameter here.....
