Subject: newbie hello, and 79 westy Q's for y'all (long-ish)

Howdy folks!
  new here, but a vet of the vintage list at times and the T3 list as well.
damn vw's get in the blood.
anywho...
  looks like i just inherited (bought for next to nothing) a 79 westy
that's in primo shape except for the canvas and the engine.
was gonna strip her for camp parts for the 64 (propane/bed/new tires/etc)
then rebuild and sell her, but, you see it's like this; my better half
actually DIGS this rig and it looks like We may keep her, without any raping.
So...
here's the deal:
I'm about to check out the FAQ and archives of course, but wanted to put this
out beforehand:
 she blows white at startup then chugs to blue/blackish
 fires right up, but Obviously has NO compression to speak of.
my plan is to pull the block, take off the top and rebuild if the bottom is
sound.
both heads (valves) and rings etc... regardless of whether it's simply rings.
(no, i haven't done the compression check yet, since it was Literally a
give away,
and have to get it into my driveway ASAP), then slap her back together
and re-evaluate whether we should sell her or start using her to head to my
land in mexico
rather than the '64. (I know, too much information, but hey, family tends
to BE that way, don't they?!)
 My Questions for YOU are these:
Any recommendations on anyone doing reasonably priced top-end work in
northern california
(specifically San Francisco/east bay area)? or any leads on T3 or T4
used/rebuilt motors that
might fit my needs?

also, i'll do some surfing tonight, but any links relevant to the '79 and
it's powerplant/resto would
be appreciated since most of my links are for the 64 bus and the 69 fastback.

thanks to all
shin
64 poptop
69 fasty MT (cheap but sweeeet)
and NOW a '79 blown-powerplant westy
(let's not even get into past vehicles, OK?!)
