Try BowWow auto parts for new,  or Malahat Auto for used parts, both have web
pages.

&gt; Web searching and magazine viewing indicates that there are plenty of
&gt; companies offering aftermarket VW Bus parts.  Most of these companies
&gt; are located in the US (primarily California and Florida).  Ording into
&gt; the US means exchanging Canadian to US funds, and dealing with Customs
&gt; delays and Customs fees.  Are there any good Canadian VW parts
&gt; specialists (new car dealers excluded)?
