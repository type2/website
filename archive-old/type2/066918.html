Subject: For Jim Digennaro- green bus!

I don't know if Jim is on this list, but I remember hearing something about
that darned green bus and have decided that I would give him a lead...

At a place called Coach House Motors in McHenry there is a green Vanagon
(year unknown, but the color is indeed quite beautiful) in the back.  I
asked if it was for sale over the summer (while my engine was getting
switched with a new rebuild) and the guy there (forgot his name, but he's
very nice) said it wasn't, that it probably wouldn't be for a while because
they're going to rebuild the engine and fix up a couple different things...
Well, I didn't bother him too much considering I don't have money enough
for another vehicle anyway, but I bet if you REALLY want it, he'll sell it
to ya.

Email me and I'll give you the number and the guy's name (have to go find
it....)

Good luck!
