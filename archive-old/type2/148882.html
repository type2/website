Volks,

On first daylight today I went out and unhooked the leads to the 
battery terminals, then cleaned them up a little (they weren't that bad 
actually) and then put the leads back on the terminals.

Hopped back in the driver's seat, turned the key, and BAM! Motor fired 
right up.

Thanks for everyone's suggestions. Kurt's was right on the money. 
Occam's Razor certainly applies in this scenario.
