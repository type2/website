Subject: Re: Another Aux battery Q

&gt; Should I use the isolator or relay? I have always been curious to
&gt; have a simple (non-electronic engineer:) explination, please.

When the bus isn't running, they both stop you running the primary
battery down when the secondary one is flat. If you use a relay, then
when you start the engine, your primary battery and secondary (possibly
flat) battery are suddenly connected together, thus allowing the flat
battery to draw current from your primary battery as well as the
charger. However, if you wire up the relay so it doesn't close until
the engine has started and is running (which is how it should be done),
then your flat secondary battery shouldn't prevent you from starting
the engine. 

The part I'm not sure about is this - could the flat battery possibly
drag down the voltage of the primary *and* sap enough of the alternator
current such that the engine dies after it starts? Anyone?

With the isolator, the batteries are always separate (i.e. &quot;isolated&quot;),
and can be charged at different rates without affecting each other. The
downside, though, is that you &quot;lose&quot; 0.6 Volts across an isolator -
which was enough to make my charging light glow a little. I got around
this by adding a diode in the voltage regulator circuit, to &quot;fool&quot; the
alternator into delivering an extra 0.6 Volts to compensate. I was
warned against this by an alternator repair shop guy, who said it would
reduce the life of the alternator, but it's worked for about 8 years
now (I really shouldn't tempt fate by writing about it...)
