Everytime I left an ignition on with the engine not firing, the coil got 
very hot (if the points happen to be closed as well). I would be concerned 
at frying the coil, but maybe the ambient temperature will save you that 
loss. So to be safe, pull the primary wire supplying the coil until you can 
get in.
