Bob, I think the partnumber of the heatshield is 039 119 227. 
The plate seems to be under the rearmost engine tin, above 
the muffler, and has two mounting tabs with 3 mounting holes 
in total. It was still available through the dealer (here in Holland) 
around 07-'98 for about $55, you might still be able to get it 
through them. On the '68&gt;'79 fiche it can be found on drawing 
number 011-00, together with the tinware -around- the engine.

Hope it helps,

Brian.
