Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Seized Up

&gt;My question is.. is this a normal occurrence in wet weather? Or do I have a
&gt;big problem to worry about?  I had the brakes done about 4000 miles ago.. so
&gt;I would assume they are in good shape.

Assumptions can kill you, Nick. Pull the drums and look things over to be
sure. I've seen too many DIY brake jobs, and more than a few from
idependant shops that, get things backwards, springs not oriented right and
even loose hardware rolling around. There is a lot of junk in the $19.95
brake shoe sets today, or get the same from JC Whipme for $12.95 plus $7
shipping.

If they put in metalic linings, (non-stock), they may have rusted to the
drum, although it doesn't seem likely in just two days. Then the hammer is
the first thing to try. But know that wear on the backing plate can allow
the lining to bind as well. The only way to know if they are right is to
pull the drums and look. Always check out all strangeness with brakes
before they jumps up and grabs you. 

As well, turned drums, which you don't know if you got unless you pull and
measure them, typically don't match the arc of the stock sized shoes. You
get very uneven wear of the lining. Down by the inspection hole, nice and
thick. Up at the top where you can't see, very thin and binding. A dry and
unlubricated since Zoroaster e-brake cable can seize as well. The hammer
can resolve all these possibles.

Replace the drums if they are over spec diameter and put on stock type
linings. Lube all metal to metal points and the e-brake cable. Adjust all
properly. Don't forget to flush DOT 4 fluid 'till it runs clean out all the
bleeders. This is not my opinion. This is what it says in Bentley!!!!! 

Or assume all is well until you hear or feel something else strange, or the
pedal falls to the floor from lack of maintenance. Read your Bentley.  Know
if you do what it says, you will have no nagging fears that something is
not right.

Have no fear to go back to where the brakes were done, if you feel they
have a well earned rep for doing good work. Tell them vos ist los, que
passa, what's happenin'. In 4000 miles you should be needing an adjustment
of the shoes any way. But if they used heavy metallic linings, or drums
turned too big, or left the e-brake cable dry, or......., they know not
what they do. Try to find references for another shop to consider to verify
functions.
