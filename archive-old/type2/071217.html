&lt;&lt;  couple of butt-ugly
 beater busses, making sure they can run, license and insure them and
 then drive them &gt;&gt;

DO IT!! This is what I threatened to do last time my company said they were 
going to take away my company car ( I'm Union, and the job steward) I told 
'em I was going to go out and buy the nastiest looking pile of junk I could 
find,paint it several colors ( with a brush) and paint &quot;Here come da phone 
man&quot; down both sides- now, would'nt that make a nice impression on our 
customers! Yeah, I still have the company car.
