&gt; I recently aquired a '74 bus.  It appears to have the '73 1700 in it
&gt; (CB) with a two-chamber holley? carb or some hybrid thing with a holley

&gt; small!.  It also has an electric fuel pump.
&gt;
&gt; The heater blower was not really operational, so I pulled it out for
&gt; now, while I figure out a short in the electricsl (red battery light ON
&gt; while key not in ignition.)
&gt;
&gt; Now, along with the blower was a relay (PN 211963141 ?) with 5 posts on
&gt; it, labeled A, B, J, M, and 31.
&gt;
&gt; There is apparently no relay for the fuel pump though.  The fuel pump
&gt; appears aftermarket, and has a wire coming out of the top of it, which
&gt; seems to make it pump when some juice that way flows.

that year bus had a mechanical fuel pump

&gt; So, I have been reading about a double relay thingy for the fuel pump,

fuel injection only part

&gt; Also, aside from the short in the system,  I have a more immediate
&gt; problem.  The bus will idle for about 5-7 seconds, rev up maybe 100 rpm,
&gt; and die.  This is what got me looking at the fuel pump.  after doing

running on the fuel in the carb, fuel pump isn't.   electric fuel pump
needs power when engine is running, also should have relay for safety

&gt; some research, I found something about an air flow meter, but isn't that
&gt; just for FI?

yup, FI only

&gt; I need to get this thing wired up so I can get it out of
&gt; where it is right now, and then get it actually wired up properly.

get some power to the fuel pump,  and be carefull, take big fire ext, and
when you get it where it needs to be, fix it right,

or better yet, tow it home
