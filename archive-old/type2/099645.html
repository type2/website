Subject: Early bay window electrical troubles help

Do this: take out your schematic (color pics are easier than Haynes' b&amp;w). 
Bentley's are clearer than Haynes'.

Locate on the schematic all of the switches and motors and lights that you 
know of. There is a legend on one of the pages that give s a letter code 
for each switch and light, etc. Figure out what the remaining symbols   on 
the schematic are.

For example the headlight switch is  'E'. Find it.

Find and check all of the ground points are. The schematic will tell you 
where they are at the end of the legend. They call them earthing or 
grounding points depending on your manual. Haynes is British so grounds are 
called earths. I'd remove each ground wires and make sure they are not 
loose or corroded. This can solve A LOT of dim taillight problems or brake 
lights that flash with the turn signals and so on.

Now pull the instrument cluster out of your van.

Mine will tilt down and lay face down on the top of the steering column 
under the steering wheel.

Now you can see the switches in the dash and the wires on the back of the 
instruments.

On the schematic notice that all of the positive circuits start at the top 
of the page. At the bottom of the page is the negative circuit (the 
chassis). Anything screwed of plugged into tabs welded to the chassis is 
going to be negative.

Buy or borrow a multimeter. Digital or analog doesn't matter. On the analog 
meter set it to the first voltage level above 12 volts. Maybe 20 volts.

You could set it to 120 volts if you wanted but the needle isn't going to 
move much.

If the meter is set to 20 volts then when the needle moves all the way over 
you've got 20 volts. Half that is 10 volts. 12 volts would be a bit more 
than halfway.

Also you need to learn to do continuity tests. That the ohm sign or the 
upside down horseshoe. If you set the meter to this and touch the test 
leads together the meter needle should go all the way over. There is a knob 
or wheel that you can adjust to get the needle to the max position. If you 
think you need a screwdriver to adjust it then you are trying to adjust the 
wrong thing.  Should just require your thumb or finger.

Anyhow the continuity test allows you to see if power is getting from one 
place to another. Good for testing wires and switches.

On a basic toggle switch the meter would stay at infinity (needle at the 
left end of the scale, not moving) when the switch is off.  The open switch 
is not passing any current because it is open (the contacts inside the 
switch are not touching) and this represents an infinite resistance to 
current flow. When the switch is on (contacts inside switch are touching) 
the meter would go to zero (far right) on a continuity test because it 
represents no current blockage.

NEVER TEST A LIVE CIRCUIT WITH THE CONTINUITY FUNCTION. It will fry your 
meter.

Another way to test a circuit is to see if you are getting 12 volts at the 
end of the circuit. Put the black lead to something metal like a screw head 
that is screwed to the frame of the vehicle. Try to dig it in there so your 
test lead scratches through any corrosion to clean metal for good contact. 
Put the red lead on a wire you think has or should have 12 volts in it. If 
it does the meter goes to 12 volts.

You can also test with this logic: the meter simply tells you if there is a 
difference in potential (voltage). That means it will tell you 12 volts is 
in a wire if there is 12 volts in one wire and 0 volts in the other wire. 
(They could both be positive wires). If 1 wire had 5 volts and the other 
had 7 volts (should not happen in a VW bus anywhere I can think of) then 
your meter would show 2 volts.

You can test fuses this way too. If the fuse is good then there will be 12 
volts on the source side and 12 volts on the load side so the difference 
would be zero (needle would not move). If the fuse was bad then there would 
be 12 volts on the source side and 0 volts on the load side and you would 
see 12 volts on your meter. You can remove a fuse and see the same effect 
as a fuse being bad and the meter will tell you 12 volts.

Now that you've got a good idea of how to run your meter, and you know how 
to read the schematics find a wire of your choice and check it for voltage.

For example the red wire on the headlight switch should have voltage I 
believe at anytime. When the switch is on the dash lights (grey/red wire I 
think) should have 12 volts+ on them. The metal backing of the instrument 
panel would be the ground.

By checking the system one switch at a time, 1 bulb at a time it won't seem 
so overwhelming. There is really only a couple dozen wires there though to 
me - it looks like a hundred.

My van ('78) has a headlight switch, a cigarette lighter, and a hazard 
lights switch. You van will have another switch for the rear dome light.

On the column are several functions: left/right turn indicators, high/low 
beam toggle on the left side. On the right side is the wipers with off, 
low, and high speeds.

Also on the passenger side of the dash is a knob for the rear defroster.

I can talk you through individual circuits if you want. I did assume you 
are a newbie. I am an ex-Navy electrician and do not know everything but I 
will help where I can.
