Subject: brake booster

Hi all.  I'm having some interesting problems with my
'78 transporter brakes.  I live in Illinois and during
the first real cold snap it was like my brakes froze. 
They were frozen in the off position and were hard as
a rock.  I had no brakes at all.  I took it to a
garage to thaw them out so i could at least get my bus
home and when they thawed there was a puddle of water.
 The garage people said that it came from the vaccum
and they cleaned it out with a solvent in the hopes to
at least get me through the winter.   They said
however, that i would need a new brake booster to
ensure against this ever happening again.  Please shed
some light on this situation for me.  I'm a new bus
owner but do want to be able to take care of her.  

Thanks
