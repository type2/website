Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0l out 1.6 in ??

Make sure you're timed properly, that will give the same symptoms you=20
mentioned.

&gt; Mmmm, I think you need to pull those carbs OUT &amp; have a good look at th=

&gt;It appears that the fuel isn't getting into the engine enough to warm it=

&gt;Strip down the carbs, or better still, take it to a VW specialist.......=
you're in Germany, for Goodness sake, there must SOMEONE who is a guru on=
 them!
&gt;As far as transfering that 1600 in, it really isn't that hard a job to d=
o.
&gt;The bell housing &amp; starter motor you should be able to get from a wrecke=
rs &amp; as I said before, the starter motor from a 1303 1600cc Beetle is exa=
ctly the same.
&gt;Once the 1600 was in you would probably find the bus much easier to work=
 on.
&gt;In fact if the 2.0l is so much trouble &amp; you're much more comfortable wi=
th a 1600, sell your 2.0l box as well &amp; get the complete driveline fro th=
e 1600.
&gt;You'll probably end up with spare change since 2.0l boxes are in demand,=
 although it won't be real flash on an autobahn.
&gt;If you can sort out the carb situation, because it does seem to be a fue=
l flow problem, you should be out of the woods &amp; not have to deal with th=
e engine change.
&gt;Oh, &amp; make sure that the fuel pump is doing it's job as well.
&gt;
