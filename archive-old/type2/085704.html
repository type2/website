Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS visitors

George,
	No, I was referring to the relief galley below the rear tin on the drivers 
side, bottom of the case.  It threads into the galley replacing the oil 
relief plug.  I have thought about threading a hole in the plug you're 
referring to, but have never done so.

&gt; &gt; I have always used the VDO oil-galley-plug sender on my air-cooled 
&gt;engines.
&gt; &gt; Fresh oil from the bearings being monitored at all times.  It's 
&gt;accurate,
&gt; &gt; and tells me what's going on at the heart of my engine.
&gt;
&gt;Does that go ito the plug that faces aft directly behind the oil pressure
&gt;sender?
