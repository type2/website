Subject: Question on Unceased Engine

Hello everybody,
   I have been doing a rebuild on my friends 76 for a while now as a weekend 
fun thing. We got the engine all back together a few weeks ago, and have been 
putting on the FI and extras. Then some weird stuff started to happen.
    First problem was that the  pushrods seemed to be about a quarter inch 
short. I asked him if he compared the old to the new. I took his word for it 
that they were the same. Turns out that on the fifth time (first time that i 
watched) that we checked their length, the new rods shrunk by about a quarter 
inch. Are there two different sizes of rods for hydrolic lifters? I know that 
rods for solid lifters are a different size, but are there any other 
variations?
    The next problem arose right before putting the engine back in the bus. I 
was turning the engine with a 13mm socket from the middle of the fan, and it 
slowly started to bind up, untill it was impossible to budge. After some 
investigation, I found that when the flywheel is removed, the engine will 
turn. When it is tightened back on, it squeezes in, and wont allow any 
movement. It pushes so hard against the main oil seal that it wont spin. I 
dont remember taking any shims out of there when dismanteling. I dont quite 
understand everything involved in this end play stuff with the crank shaft, 
but i'm figuring that i need to put in some shims. My friend has the manuals, 
and i wont be able to see them till next weekend. Anyway, I have a few 
questions that i feel wont be answered by Haines or Muir anyway. If the 
engine was possibly run with too much endplay, or needs to have it adjusted, 
is that suggestive of significant main bearing wear? I suppose that the time 
it takes to split the case and do that may be worth it in the longrun. If 
anybody has had any similar experiance (or any advice) in this sort of matter 
I would greatly appreciate any replys. 
   I last left in a state of frustration, and dint think too much about what 
to do next weekend.
 Thanks
   Matt O.
