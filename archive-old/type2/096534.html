Subject: Re: [T2] Front Shift Bushing Replacement

Travis,

As I said several weeks ago to someone on this exact thread...

this is one of those jobs that the hard way *is* the easy way.

You might try just loosening up the shifter, but the point is, it probably 
needs cleaning and greasing up anyway.

Just do it!
Bentley tells how to set it back correctly.



Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello All:
&gt; I sent this out some time ago and didn't get much response, so I thought I'd
&gt; resend it.  My shifting seems to be getting even sloppier, so I thought the
&gt; time was right (again)....
&gt; 
&gt; All this talk about shift couplers and bushings and such has my mind on one
&gt; of my ongoing issues:  ultra-sloppy shifting due to a worn-out and mangled
&gt; front shift bushing (the circular rubber thing).  Anyway, I remember reading
&gt; here once where someone was able to replace this bushing without having to
&gt; mess with also removing the shifter apparatus from the floor above; he said
&gt; he was able to move the front section of the shift rod (separated from the
&gt; rear section) far enough back to slip the bushing into housing at the front
&gt; of the rod.  I got under and cuss and try as I might, I could not make it
&gt; happen.  I cannot move the front section of the rod far enough back, and I
&gt; don't want to force anything.  Is there anyone else out there who has been
&gt; able to do it this way without removing the shifter and if so, what is the
&gt; secret?  I just don't want to remove the whole shifter assembly, go through
&gt; the mysteries of getting it all back together right, then have my shifting
&gt; end up being even worse (which is what I keep reading here).
&gt; 
&gt; Also, if it turns out that I DO need to remove the shifter, is getting it
&gt; all back together right (and being able to shift properly afterwards) really
&gt; as involved and difficult as it sounds?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any contributons!
