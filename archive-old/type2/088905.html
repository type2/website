Subject: '74 Bus parts out Heater boxes/muffler/tailpipe

Hello all.  Here is what I have to offer in Marblehead, MA:

1974 bus heat exchangers, muffler and tailpipe in one piece.    I replaced
the entire system 1.4 years ago.  Only drove the bus half of that time.
Never even got to hook the heat up the rest of the way after all of that!
The bus sat for the rest of that time.  I pulled the system out, wiped 'er
down and she's still showing the factory primer and is in terrific
condition.  I was going to go ahead and sand a little and re-primer, but I
don't want folks to think I pulled out a 3 year old system and just
repainted.  I figured I would leave it with it's factory primer so you could
see that it indeed is not that old at all and is in great shape.  Some quick
paper on this thing, a quick primer and she would look quite spanking.
$180

I've also got the one other thing that was in excellent shape.  The
dashboard.  Complete.  Got the screws and clips they screw into and
everything.  Took care in parting this particular item.  I am going to do
just a little bit of re-hab to this dash.....repaint the black on top...it's
chipping....but in a month or so I will be offering up this dashboard.  Will
be a great replacement if someone needs one.

Dustin

P.S.  Thanks David!!
