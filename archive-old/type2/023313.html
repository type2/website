Subject: Re: [T2] resistance specs/temp 2 sender

Take a close look at where the wire goes - it it goes to a bolt head - 
you've the sender already there.

If not I would pop a valve cover off and look at the serial number.

Bet you have a '72-'74 engine that came originally with carbs and no temp 
senders.

Let us know what you find.

&gt;The wire that should connect to the head temp sensor
&gt;on the 1979 engine in my 75 bus is grounded to the
&gt;engine tin.  I bought a new sensor and then discovered
&gt;that there is no place in the tin for it to go.  Tin
&gt;all looks proper, no odd holes anywhere, so I think it
&gt;is proper for the 79 engine.  I have to start the bus
&gt;3 or 4 times to get it to run--it runs a second or two
&gt;each time, until finally after 3 or 4 time, it finally
&gt;keeps running.  Next time i need to take the engine
&gt;out I will, of course, look and see if the head has a
&gt;spot for the sensor.  Until then, I guess I will live
&gt;with it, or perhaps put a pushbutton momentary contact
&gt;switch at the dash so I can temporarily have a
&gt;resistance in the circuit for starting purposes.
&gt;Haven't tried it yet, though.
