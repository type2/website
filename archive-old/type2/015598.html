I'm responding to Jay but talking to everyone here, particular newbees.

&gt;I too need to thank Doc Stephens and Karl vS for the assist with my new
bosch starter. I went &gt;with a NEW bosch to avoid headaches. It was cheap,
can't hurt, may help, and for the first time &gt;in years,  the bus starts on
one try.  I DO have to give it some gas and crank for a bit, but she &gt;fires
on one try!

Too many people ignore a 15 year old starter and suffer with continued poor
function for sometimes years. Once the symptoms of poor starter function
start (pun intended), verify the battery and alternator and wiring. If
that's good, the starter is weak. Since you normally can suffer along with
a glitch now and then for several months at least, you have the time to
plan and budget a proper Bosch Corp. REMAN. Put it in and get another 15+
years service. Plan to replace the things you know are weak before they
fail. Now, I want everone to check the door pulls. If the screws are loose,
TIGHTEN THEM!!!!! Don't just keep pulling on them till they come loose and
you loose the screw. 

Half the T-II's that come into my shop have loose or missing door pull
screws that takes less than a minute and a screwdriver to fix.

Side door. The first time you note it's not tracking or closing or opening
right, plan to fix it. Don't keep slamming the s**t out of it for a year
until it breaks something. A few drops of lube for the bearings once a
year, and each lock cylinder, make this stuff last MUCHO GRANDE longer.

&gt;What should I check to make her start with no gas pedal, on the first try
as it should? She has &gt;brand new, (all bosch): plugs, wires, cap ,rotor,
blue coil, starter, cold-start-valve, &gt;thermotime switch, hot start relay
kit.  Ideas? I'd like to get it perfect!

Verify that throttle switch, if you got one. Otherwise, the only thing
left, Jay, is build up of crud inside the plenum, intake runners and on the
back of the intake valves. This layer of buildup absorbs enough of the
initial charge to lean things out at startup. Try a can of Lubro-Moly
Jectron and/or Ventil Sauber. Can't find it?? Web search. Try Automotion or
Performance Products. Otherwise, get the spendy high concentrate Chevron
Techron addative at the local FLAPS, not the $3.99 stuff, the $13 stuff.
Sometimes it improves things, if buildup is the cause, before you use half
a tank of fuel. I like to add a can to half a tank, use half that, then
refill the tank. If you note a difference you know you have found the cause
of your symptom. Remove the intake manifolds/runners, clean the crud out of
them. With them out you can see the back of the intake valves. That's hard
carbon and there is no way I know of to remove it without removing the
heads and valves. Pull a valve cover. Set one of the exhaust valves just a
coupla millimeter off it's seat. Push the top of the valve back and forth.
Bentley has the spec. If the valve guides are worn, budget a minor
overhaul/rebuild within the next year and solve both problems. Otherwise,
you can learn to live with the unperfect not quite excellent cold start
until you can't live with it anymore.

And always before any of the above, confirm specs for compression,
ignition, fuel delivery pressure and volume, injector spray patterns and
final adjustments. Sometimes you can set the final mixture at the high side
of spec and improve such minor issues. Follow procedures. Not disconnecting
the crankcase breather can add more than 1% CO making the base mixture weak
from the get go. There are NO STEPS from page 1 to the end of the FI
chapter that should be skipped if you really want to find the culprit every
time without missing the malfactor, and wasting time/money.
