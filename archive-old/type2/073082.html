&gt;A local dealer has an 85 Vanagon for sale. The interior is in like new
condition. The body is very nice, with rust peeking thru above both  rear
fenders. It's running strong, the AC doesn't work, but everything else
does. I did find an anti-freeze leak on the water pump and one of the
hoses. I don't anything about Vanagons, only that the engines had a very
bad reputations, but for $1,500 asking price,  I'm very tempted. What do
you guys think? Suggestions, ideas, comments welcome.

Victor, try to ask that question over in the vanagon group
&lt;vanagon_at_gerry.vanagon_dot_com&gt; and you will get probably more answers/opinions
and help on the vanagon. I don't have personal experience with watercooled
ones besides what I read (good and bad). I love my aircooled engine.

	Karl.
