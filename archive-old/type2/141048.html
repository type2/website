Subject: Re: [T2] 78 FI Spark Plug Part Deux

Looking like you made the right choice for sure to take off the head. My
suggestion was ONLY because I thought the engine was in situ. There is a guy
in Portland people either love or hate, named James Lutz. He does nothing
but VW work. He used to have the shop, Strictly Foreign and the no. was
503-233-0030 . Don't know if he's still around or not, but it's worth a try.
Also, don't forget that any motorcycle shop is really experienced in playing
with aluminum heads too.
Take care,
Courtney



&gt; With Cliff's help over the weekend, we took a part a lot of the engine
since
&gt; that is what you do when you want to replace/work on something totally not
&gt; connected to the Spark Plug thread issue. Took AMC Head off and saw a lot
of
&gt; shavings inside. Good thing we opted that way.  Tried the HeliCoil
approach
&gt; to no avail. Need to find Machinist in Portland, OR that can spend 30 mins
&gt; or so making this sparkplug hole WHOLE.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone in Portland know of a good VW/Machinist Shop that could do this?

&gt;
&gt; To Courtney, Bob, Shaggy, George, Don and David:  Thanks for all your
&gt; pointers.  All were great suggestions and help.  I would have loved to not
&gt; have taken off the head, but since I did not want shavings and I am not
the
&gt; idiot that John Muir thinks I am, I needed to.
