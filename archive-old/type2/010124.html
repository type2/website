So I went to the archives, and the very first archived message in the 
queue was:

   RE: Vacuum Leaks, (long, but please read it all)

So, okay, this was more than a year or two ago. But I still got it by 
search &lt;vacuum AND guage&gt;. If, however, I had searched for &quot;vacume,&quot; I 
would have gotten nothing. 

For the archives to work, vacuum has got to be spelled v-a-c-u-u-m and 
jalousie windows j-a-l-o-u-s-i-e. Either that or you must be creative at 
searching all possible misspellings.

Rant over,

Mark
