I have the HF grinder, with the same problem (funny thing -- it came 
with an extra set of brushes, as though the brushes were going to wear 
out before the bearings). But as it turns out, I've used that grinder 
for several years, to do all kinds of things (like cut an opening for a 
vent in a stucco wall) and it keeps on jugging.

My experience with tools is that there is no middle ground between (a) 
absolute crap and (b) good enough to use every day for years. And 
really no way to tell the one from the other except through experience. 
Some cheap things seem to do all I ever require of them; others fail 
quickly and I go out and get something else. So, by buying cheap the 
first time around and replacing the ones that are absolute crap with 
something better, I figure I come out ahead in the end. But I can't 
prove it.
