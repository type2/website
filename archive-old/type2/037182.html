Subject: New Paint Job

We have just finished painting the Cow Bus, you might remember it if you
visited our web sight before, so if you would like to share in our
excitement please go to: http://my.treeway_dot_com/MurrayBus and check it
out again.

I also have a few more pictures of the body with no interior, if you
would like to see those look under 72 Bus.

I'm not an expert but I have learned allot about body preparation and
painting. If you have any questions about body work or painting I might
be able to help, so drop me a line.

Thanks
Meredith
