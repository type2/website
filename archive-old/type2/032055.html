Does anyone have or know where I could get hold of the combustion blower
vane housing for a 79 auxillary heater.  I think the heater is a
Eberspacher BA6, I am not sure but I know it is the stock one for a 79'
bus. The combustion blower vane housing is a little metal cone that goes
between the combustion blower and the body of the heater. I guess it is
there to protect the propelor on the combustion blower.  Mine is missing
and I can't seem to find a replacement.  Any help would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,
Ken Fricke
