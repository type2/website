Subject: Re: [T2] Seinfelds Engine

Quite an entertaining article.  It is obvious to me that the &quot;Seinfeld&quot;
episode with &quot;The Maestro&quot; is taken directly from this interchange.

All this banter about cams and used lifters has enlightened me.  I have
always thought that my 76 Bus had hydraulic lifters, so I never thought
twice about them.  Come to find out, it doesn't.  I guess I'll have to pull
out the Bentleys and figure out how to adjust the whole mess, and maybe I'll
get more than 9 mpg out of the tired, but still well running engine.

&gt;Harry Pellow, &quot;The Maestro&quot; of Porsche 356/912 fame, writes great stories.
&gt;He're one about Jerry Seinfields 356 motor. Pay attention to all the
&gt;mistakes made by the rebuilder. Many are no different than the mistakes of
&gt;mismatched parts made on T-IV Bus engines.
