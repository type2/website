Subject: Re: [T2] Powder Coat Fuel Tank

&lt;&lt; Is there any reason you couldn't powder coat the inside of a fuel tank?  My
understanding is powder coating is extremely resistant to solvents.
Seems like you could drop the tank off at the radiator shop for a good
cleaning, take it to the powder coater and be done.
I guess the two major considerations are:
Could you get adequate spray coverage from the available openings?
Will it hold up?
I'll probably do a little research with my powder coating sources but was just
wondering if anyone knew this off the top of their head.
Thanks, &gt;&gt;

It might be resistant to today's fuel, but might not be resistant to
whatever witch's brew passes for gas next week...One of the reas-
ons for the present gas price crunch (or whatever term you'd prefer)
is the diversity of local blends (seasonally adjusted, even... ;-)
