Subject: Starter Selenoid (high/low)

I was wondering if anyone could explain the high/low side of a Starter 
Selenoid.  Meaning...There's the main feed (batt Pos, then two sides to 
attach other wires too. Ignition, etc.  I don't see any visual designation 
to one or the other, but read about the high/low side...How do I know which 
side to attach the Black/Red wire to?
Probably a dumb question, but I had to ask...
Lo
