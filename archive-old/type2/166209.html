Subject: 1979 Federal Fuel Injected Type 2 won't idle.

I've started reading through the library and I don't have the patience 
to search the archives, but I thought I would give this a shot anyway.

It starts fine and dies in about 5 seconds. If I keep on the gas or give 
a a push every so often it will keep running, but again, after about 5 
seconds it dies.

Any suggestions would be very helpful.
