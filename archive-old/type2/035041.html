Subject: Re: retorque'n those heads

The fastidious answer: Pull the engine at 300 miles and retorque. Then 
you will not have to worry about it.
 
The less fastidious answer: There is one head nut that is easy to get at 
when you take off the valve covers. Slip a torque wrench and give it a 
turn. _Don't_ torque it up. If your indicator is showing around 15-20 ft 
lbs and the wrench is still turning, you need to retorque. If the 
indicator goes over 20 before the nut begins to move, don't tighten it. 
Just relax, put your valve cover back, and rejoice. You don't need to 
retorque.

There is a small chance that the one nut is not representative. I 
wouldn't worry about it, but if you are inclined to, see my first answer.
