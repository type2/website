&gt;  Don't forget the thermostat flaps do more than restrict the air flow to a

&gt;  Once they are fully open, in a type 1 motor the flaps help direct the air

&gt;circulating inside the fan shroud. In a type 4 motor the flap on the 3 &amp; 4 
&gt;cylinder
&gt;side directs air through the oil cooler (the oil cooler gets no cooling air
&gt;  without that flap).
&gt;  They are an integral part of the cooling systems and should not be left out.
==============================&gt;
Don't know about a type 4, but I do not believe that to be the case in a 
type 1 motor.

The shroud serves as the volute to the fan blade which, from memory of 
observation, appears to be of mixed flow design on the low side of specific 
speed numbers for that class of blade.

The air in the volute is discharged from the volute even with the flaps 
removed.
Whether the flaps are present, or not, the pressured air in the volute will 
still exit the outlets.
