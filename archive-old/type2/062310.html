Subject: NJ to Ontario tonight!

Hey Volks

Is it Friday?  We're off to KenStock!  Me and the gang, riding in
Samiam, my '77 Westy, embarking on his longest trip since I've had
him, about 500 miles each way; New Jersey to Oxford Mills, Ontario.

We're tuned, lubed, oil changed, new shocks and muffler, and completely
serviced by the local VW guru.  Carrying spare parts, flares, toolkits,
St. Muir and a cell phone; not tempting fate.

Caravaning up with Robert Tommaselli (he of the '95 Eurovan Camper,
&quot;The Space Shuttle&quot;) for extra good measure.

Stay tuned for a trip report next week!

        TTFN
                Jay
