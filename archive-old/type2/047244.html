Subject: [T2] Aux Battery Setup

Thanks to all who replied to my post, both on and off list.  Replies
seemed to fall along one of two lines.  The majority says not to bother
with a switch, reroute wiring for the radio and lights to the aux
battery and be done with it.  The other side is that powering
accessories off the aux battery while running is not a good idea.

The instructions which came with the relay are less than complete and
lend themselves to misinterpretation.  The line concerning use of
accessories off the aux battery while the battery is charging is worded
like this: &quot;Please note, to ensure satisfactory charging, we recommend
that no consumers should be connected to the auxiliary battery during
charging.&quot;.

The use of the words &quot;satisfactory&quot; and &quot;recommend&quot; lead me to accept
Ron's explanation of this issue:

&quot;Actually, what the instructions are saying, in a somewhat cryptic
manner, is
that to allow optimal charging performance, you should not run items off

the aux battery when charging.  Not that doing so will actually harm
anything (under normal circumstances).&quot;

Since the simple design of the bus's fuse box allows for easy relocation
of wiring, and installing a switch would require cutting into the wiring
harness, I plan to relocate the interior lights to a power lead off the
aux battery.  Then as I add other &quot;camping items&quot;, I'll tie them into
this lead as well.

Thanks again,
