&gt; Well, the distributor was not the right way around.  The key was 
&gt; definitely on the right.  I swapped the wires around, went to crank it,

&gt; rusted tailpipe just before it died.  It hasn't started since, but at 
&gt; least I feel like I'm on the right track.

Ok, so did you watch the valves while spinning the crank to find the 
correct TDC for #1 per the instructions that I provided?  Was the drive 
gear in the correct position?  If not, let's fix that instead of 
swapping wires.

If you haven't done this, let us know and we'll go from there and guide 
you on how to get your distributor drive gear installed correctly.


&gt; Just to make sure I'm doing this right, the firing order should now be 
&gt; 3-2-1-4, correct?

it's 1432, but that's close enough ;)  If you look at the ducting on the 
driver's side of the engine, just where the tin meets the cooling fan 
shroud, you'll see the firing order stamped into the tin.

&gt; Also, at one point while turning over the engine I heard a pop, went 
&gt; back to check it out and a lot of the vacuum lines were blown off.  In 
&gt; fact it blew the part that holds the air filter off the s boot, and it 
&gt; was on tight. What might cause that?  It only happened the one time then 
&gt; and hasn't happened since, and I've done a lot of cranking.

If your #1 TDC is correct, then you should be able to line up the rotor 
pointing towards the mark that denotes where the #1 plug hooks up.  Here 
is a diagram of how the cables hook up to the distributor:

3               1
  \             /
   \           /
    3   2 - \ /
      D      X
    4   1 - / \
   /           \
  /             \
4               2

where D is the distributor.  Notice that the 1,2 wires cross.  With the 
firing order being 1432 while the rotor is spinning clockwise, you 
should always be able to figure out if the wires are hooked up 
correctly.. given that your distributor is installed correctly ;)
