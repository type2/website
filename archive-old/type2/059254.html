Subject: More on the Hoover bulkhead fitting

Maybe others have had better luck than I did. I checked Home Depot and 
several other Wonderbread-style lumber and hardware joints. They all had 
the correct nipples for this fix, but no hex nuts (1/2&quot; SAE fine thread). 
Finally found two in an old lamp store.

Start at an old lamp store: it will save you time and aggravation.
