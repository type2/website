Subject: nose mounted spare

Hi Volks,
   The spare on my 71 westy is mounted on the nose, and the back side of the 
tire hits the front skin.  Is this normal?  If not, what combination of 
spacers and nuts hold the wheel far enough away that the tire doesn't hit?  
Thanks in advance for the advice I know I'll get.
