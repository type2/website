I have done lots of shopping with Bus Boys and they are GREAT!
Walt knows his bus parts. I have never ordered from Bus Depot so 
I can't flame them but I can praise Bus Boys.
I don't think I will my business anywhere else anyway.

I am afraid I have to agree with the few who have publicly slighted Bus
Depot. I had a hard time deciding whether I wanted to flame them on the
list or not. I used to have a link from my web page and I wanted to like
them!! I have ordered from them 4 times and was never happy. Always took
an exceptionally long time to get my items. I tried to buy my pop
canvas-be about 10 days they said. I called wolfsburg west and had it in
about 4 days from California to North Carolina. One time I specifically
told them to check to be sure the items I wanted were IN STOCK when I
placed my order, yes they assured me they were. Of 8 items I only got 5.
&quot;They are on backorder&quot; I was told when I paid for the phone call to
find out. Rather than apologize they said they could refund my money and
hung up. I called wolfburg west and had my missing parts in 4 days. I
received the wrong part once(a beetle visor retainer), but at about 2
dollars didn't even bother with calling. I realize every company has a
few orders that they can't get out quickly, but I haven't had any good
experiences with Busdepot. If you have let me know!!! I don't buy from
them anymore. I recommend Bus-Boys. campcrazy www.72camper_dot_com

&gt; Best prices on bus parts anywhere guys.  The reason is that Ron shops.

&gt; Sometimes takes a little while to find a part probably.
&gt;
&gt; Also - the 1-800 number is very obviously stated to be for ORDERING by
PART
&gt; NUMBER only.
&gt;
&gt; You got money to spend on bus parts, you got money to make a phone 
&gt; call. RTFM.

&gt; It kinda what you get when you order from them. I have already this 
&gt; year ordered close to 1k worth of stuff and continue too. I wait and 
&gt; wait but eventually they get there. The only beef I have with them is 
&gt; when you try to call the 1800 number to say that something didnt come 
&gt; but was on the packing order and your asked to call the long distance 
&gt; number. Should I be penalized for something I didnt receive, I got it 
&gt; taken care of but the call cost me $1-2 more on top of my order. Other

&gt; than that Im very happy with the service, the quality, prices, and the

&gt; knowledge. Sure they are slow (Im still waiting on a lot of
&gt; items) but who the hell cares unless you are in need of a part, if you

&gt; want it faster order from somewhere else.
&gt;
&gt; just my two cents.

&gt; &gt;I didn't notice anything in your post about trying to contact their 
&gt; &gt;customer service department to air your grievance.  If you haven't 
&gt; &gt;done that, maybe it would have been appropriate prior to bringing it 
&gt; &gt;to the list. Just a thought.....
