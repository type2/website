Subject: Inner wheel wells needed

Hey list:

I've got a buddy in the middle of rust repair on an otherwise very sweet
'78 Westfalia.  He is not dialed into the net yet so I'm posting for him.
Where can repair panels for the rear inner wheel wells be obtained??  If
new is not available, does anyone out there know of any salvage panels
available that are rust free??

Thanx
