Subject: Re: [T2] raw fuel in exhaust

I believe the needle valve is staying open allowing fuel to flood in and not
completely burn.
If it was one cylinder missing the fuel would probably burn up in exaust
pipe before exiting.
How does the engine run? Smooth, rough, idle???

  it may just be running rich.  I am guessing the inside of the pipe is
black.   Is it FI or carb?

  My buddy is having some raw fuel come out of his exhuast pipe. He hasn't
seen it, but can smell it a lot.

  I imagine its not firing on 1 or more of the cylinders. What do we do to
test it, besides checking the spark plug for a spark? Could there be a leak
or something?

  Thanks,
