Subject: Re: [T2] [T2]: Valve seat issue again and again... (longish)

&gt;So here are my questions:
&gt;
&gt;(1) Why am I having this valve seat problem again and again. Is it
&gt;because of overheating? Shouldn't I just get burned valves if this is
&gt;the cause?

Used heads, reworked x many times for minimal cost.

&gt;(2) Why is it always the intake? I thought exhaust valves get a lot
&gt;hotter...

They do. The intake fails because of a design flaw.

&gt;(3) I read about new AVP heads. What about their quality? Do they really
&gt;last for long?

New heads are made by AMC.

Anyone else selling a &quot;new head&quot; for $200 that doesn't use an AMC casting which costs more to begin with is re-using the original factory casting. YMMV.

&gt;(4) Could the carbs be the source of the problem? Adjusted too lean?
&gt;Wouldn't oil-temperature indicate running lean (overall high oil-temp)?

Oil temperature isn't going to tell you when the heads are overheating. Install a CHT sender until the spark plug and go by that gauge.
