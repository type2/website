Whenever I've bought a new clutch cable Bowden tube it came with the sheath
inside.  You don't have to got to a VW dealer, the tubes are available at
any FLAPS with VW stuff and they only cost a few bucks.  Lots of folks
replace the tube every time they replace the clutch cable.

It is very important to get the curve in the tube oriented properly and with
the specified amount of displacement.

&gt;&gt;  My question is, does the new Bowden tube come with the sheath?  &lt;&lt;
