Subject: Re: [T2] Exaust Leak

&gt; &gt; has anyone had good luck putting this back together with the copper
&gt; &gt; 8mm nuts?
&gt;
&gt; I am sorry to say that my experience with the copper nuts was not a happy
&gt; one.  I found and bought a box of what were labeled &quot;copper exhaust nuts&quot;
&gt;
&gt; As I said in my previous post, I have had good luck with stainless nuts
&gt; and bolts on the exhaust for my '80 Vanagon.   Metric stainless fittings
&gt; are not easy to find, but worth the effort!
&gt;
&gt; If I could find them (so far, no luck), I would say the ultimate in
&gt; corrosion resistance in the situation we are dealing with would be
&gt; silicon-bronze nuts.  Alas, I have not seen thes in metric thread here in


Steve,
Dave Jersey had a bunch of bronze or brass exhaust nuts so they are
available. Mad Uncle Dave where did you get them??
