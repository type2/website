Subject: Texas Events - Repost

There are a few VW events going on here if your schedule allows for some
fun.

Bugswarm is in the south parking lot of the Ballpark At Arlington Sept.
15.(25 Miles from Dallas)  There may be another all-make swap meet going
on in the west parking lot at the same time.  The Ennis TX event is the
biggest VW swap meet and show in the region.  It's at the Texas Motorplex
racetrack just west of Ennis on Hwy 287.  (41 Miles from Dallas) It's
Sept 23.  These are both great VW events that I've attended for years. 
Bugswarm is a really great VW show, as is Ennis.  If you can make them,
you'll enjoy yourself.
