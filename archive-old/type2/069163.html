Subject: '71 &quot;pull to the right prob&quot;

Hi'yall,

New rebuilt GEX engine had it's first outing yesterday. Santa
Barbara and back (from L.A.).  Breaking in nicely.  However,
the slight pull to the right that I had experienced before was
VERY pronounced with my SO sitting on the passenger side.  I
don't think it's that she's THAT heavy, since she's been sticking
to her diet and all...The 'ol arms ached after holding into a
left turn there and back. 

Checked the bearings when I got back.  No slop there.  Right lower
ball joint is loose as a goose at the wheel-end of the swing arm.
The left one is tight as a drum.  Nothing bent. New steering damper.

And once in a while, after hitting a pothole/bump, I get a really
bad shake that seems to come from the right.  So far I can get it
out of &quot;shudder&quot; mode by turning slightly, then back.  Could all 
this come from a sloppy lower ball joint ?  

Advice/thots welcome,

Thanks,

- -John Austin
