Subject: Re: [T2] speedo adjustment? 



&gt; I have 71 westy and the indicated speed is around 20-25mph+!!!!....when you
&gt; take apart the speedo, what do you adjust to make it right? How difficult is
&gt; it to take the speedo apart?

The needle is attached to a shaft. On the shaft is a hairspring. On the other
end of the shaft is the speed cup. The speed cup does NOT touch anything else.
It turns by a magnetic field.
The hairspring only dampens pulses and keeps the needle from bouncing.
If your speedo reads too slow, then maybe the shaft is dirty and causing too
much friction. But that is highly unlikely.
99 out of 100 reasons for speedo error is wrong tire size. Especially if it
reads too fast.
There is nothing to adjust in a speedo head if it reads too fast.
