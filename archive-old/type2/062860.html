Yep that was what I was asking about. The former owner put a beercan and 
some wire around some of the empty ports. This list is incredible!!
Thanks,

&gt; If you are referring to the large 4' wide pipe that runs the length of the
&gt; bus, try a LAMPOST.  It's good round sheet steel and you can find a way to
&gt; splice it in if hand with metalwork..   You could also try the flexible
&gt; metal piping that is made for ClothesDryer ducting; the latter is easy to
&gt; cut into and splice in whatever you want with duct tape. I b;ocked up the
&gt; pipe going to middle channel in Westie to let more defrosting reach the front...
