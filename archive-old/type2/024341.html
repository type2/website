Hi y'all,

I just put one of my heads back on and am learning about my engine.  I pulled
it because I wanted to do a compression test and instead stripped a spark plug
hole. so a good time to get to know the thumper before I hit the road.

This is a Mexican case; a doghouse 1600 w/single port heads (Bus is a ’70, tin is hacked to accommodate the doghouse exhaust).  The case has &quot;M&quot; stamped on it just to the right of the generator stand, what does that signify?  

What’s more important, I have noticed the following problems and mysteries:

1.  My doghouse exhaust duct tin is loose.  Maybe epoxy would work, but there’s still a ¼&quot; gap.  I’m thinking of gluing in a scrap of rubber to fill this gap. Would that get too hot?  Please recommend to me what kind of sealant (glue, caulk, filler) would work for this.  Seems like I don’t want this hot air recirculating in the engine compartment.  Is there a kind of tape that can withstand this heat? 

2.  There is a tube from the oil filler neck which goes down through a grommet in the front pulley tin and then is open to the air.  There is a drilled hole in this tube ½&quot; from the outlet.  Is this the &quot;oil overflow tube&quot; or what?  Seems like there should be something connected.  (There is also an oil breather outlet to the oil bath air cleaner, not what I’m talking about).  

3.  Where would the charcoal canister have hooked up?  I imagine it could have connected to the &quot;oil overflow tube&quot; but the &quot;oil overflow tube&quot; goes out of the engine compartment.

4.  There is a 3/8 inch outlet on the top right of the cooling shroud that is blocked.  Where might this have gone?  (Possibly a &quot;vacuum&quot; to suck crankcase fumes from the &quot;oil overflow tube&quot; through the charcoal canister? I can think of lots of fun ways to hook this up. . .)

5.  The flaps are wired open.  Does anyone have in their stash an extra thermostat bracket and link piece?  If not I will probably drive it as-is until I find the pieces.  (thermostat evangelists wanted)

6.  Any clues on where to find the missing air cleaner thermostat parts that I see in the manual (but then if I do find one—-what hose would hook up to that for pre-heat?) 

7.  I am missing the tin on the cylinders 2 &amp; 4, the hanging-down rear skirts that keep the air in the right place over the cylinders instead of out the back.  Anyone have extras?

Stay tuned for the next episode of &quot;This Weird Bus.&quot;  Thanks,

Will
