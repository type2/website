Subject: oil relief valves

I see that there is once again activity on the T2 list regarding oil
pressure relief valves.  Namely, recent postings by Russell and Stan
mention the role of a grooved piston.

Back in May, when I was rebuilding 1600 DP engines for my '71 Type 1 and
'71 Type  2, I was surprised to find that one engine had a grooved piston
and one without a groove, while neither piston on the other engine had a
groove.  Not knowing who rebuilt these before I bought them,  I needed
help.  I asked the T2 list and a T1 list and got several replies that
agreed with each other. The scoop was this:  If the case has a single
relief valve, the  piston has a groove. If the case has two relief valves,
neither piston has a groove.

I followed this advice and used only ungrooved pistons on the two rebuilds.

Do you all have any information that contradicts this?

Where does one go for the definitive answer on this.  The photos in Bentley
are, to my way of thinking, not conclusive.

Jack
