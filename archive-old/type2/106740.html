Subject: Re: [T2] Air Conditioning???

&gt;Quick question... I was curious if anyone had installed A/C in their
&gt;car. Now... before you guys get all upset. I personally could care less
&gt;about A/C. If it were just me, I'd drive the Bus the way it was intended..
&gt;without A/C. Heck, I drove a V6 Fiero for 4 years in Florida before I
&gt;finally got the A/C fixed. But I bought this for my fiancee, and she needs
&gt;air conditioning. (Something about being born in North Miami Beach). In any
&gt;case, I saw that on the MexiBug web site, they sell a complete A/C kit with
&gt;compressor that you can install in the volkswagen beetle. I was curious.. is
&gt;this something I could do on the Bus? I don't see why the compressor
&gt;wouldn't fit.

Sure it can be done. Just requires $$$ and $$$.

Questions: which bus do you have - Beetle powered or Type IV powered? If 
Type IV powered the Mexibug kit is not going to be a bolt on to the engine.

Next...

Start researching what dealer installed system your bus came with way back 
when if the first owners paid the extra $$$, collect pics and manuals, find 
donor bus. Remove and take lots of pictures for future reference. Some of 
it can be recycled, some of it replaced. Update compressor to newer Sanden 
style rotary compressor (more efficient, requires less HP). Learn enough to 
install the system and then have it charged with freon. Oh - of course 
there is alot of thinking to be done about whether you want to pay $$$ for 
R-12, convert to R-134a or try one of the replacement/conversion 
refrigerants. Install full set of gauges so you don't cook your motor. You 
need cylinder head temps, oil temps, oil pressure, and a tach would be nice.

Or there are a couple of shops (I.C.E.) and I think ICE may be in Florida 
where they will install a whole system for you, new - if you have the 
$,$$$. Still install those instruments!!!

Make sure every rubber piece and every metal piece of tin is complete and 
installed on your engine. The engine better be RIGHT or it won't last.

Wouldn't it be cheaper to trade for a lower-maintenance girlfriend?

Archives are FULL of a/c questions. Every spring and summer we talk about 
a/c. Every fall and winter we talk about heaters. All year long we talk 
about tires and synthetics vs. traditional motor oils. It's all there.

I spent a while dabbling with the idea of a/c. We are pretty happy without 
it but sometimes it'd nice to have. Bought a couple &quot;Motorbooks 
International&quot; how-to hot rod books to understand the process. Hunted for 
pics and manuals on the web. Read everything in the archives. Bought a used 
system (complete) and will be using that but updating it to a rotary 
compressor.
