Subject: Sliding Door Fix

I went to open the sliding door the other day while stopping at a Mcdonalds 
and when I open the door it walked away with me and fell of the car. I need 
to replace the track and I am assuming all of the inner and outer rocker 
panels need to be replaced. If anyone has any info on doing this before the 
advice would be appreciated. What kind of welder. What kind of Brazin Wire. 
All the info I can get would be great. Where can I get the track and whats 
the cost?

Casey
