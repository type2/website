Good call mike. But wether the drive is off or 180 backward, wouldn't it 
still point to the #1 wire?
Granted I would say only use this if your bus is running decently and you 
are just doing a valve adjustment.

&gt;From: Mike Soultanian You have to be careful trusting the distributor mark. 
&gt;  The drive gear may be installed incorrectly, and many times 180 degrees 
&gt;off.  It's best to watch the fan for the marking, pistons, and valves.
