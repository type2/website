&gt; &gt; I think that the distinction here is between &quot;tight&quot; but movable CVs and
&gt; &gt; incorrectly assembled (locked) CVs,  If the CV can be moved (even with
&gt; &gt; some force) when new, it is not incorrectly assembled.  The use of dry
&gt; &gt; moly lubricants by the manufacturer can make new CVs very stiff until
&gt; &gt; they run a bit.  I've never received an incorrectly assembled new CV.
&gt;
&gt; It's a matter of articulation. If a used cv joint is assembled incorrectly
&gt; it will malfunction in short order.This is noted in the original post
&gt; where two used cv joints were locked up. And yes, even a new joint
&gt; should articulate, stiff as it is.

the original post asked about new CVs, not used CVs.

It would be very difficult even to install a incorrectly assembled
&quot;locked&quot; CV, as it wouldn't articulate to match the flanges.  Something
would break if you ran them, but I doubt that anyone could even get them
installed without knowing that something is very wrong..
