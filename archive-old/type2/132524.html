Subject: RE: [T2] brake light/flasher?

I have a brake light/flasher question. 

I checked the bulb and put in a new one, checked all fuses and connections. 
Very good first step.

My headlights...They all work except for the right rear.
Good isolation of the problem to one area.

The right taillight works, but it does not light up when the 
blinker is on, nor when I turn the hazards on, nor when I press on the 
brakes.
All things that light up the bright light on this side.

cleaned the bulb connectors and the wire connecters in the tail light
assembly.  The 
wires to light are old and very stiff.  Also this right rear taillight 
has been crunched before, though I'm guessing (electrically challenged) 
that since the tail light comes on the assembly is OK?

You know what the problem is (open, no electricity to the bulb), you just
have to trace back to the point that you find the open using a test light or
volt meter.  Go slow, get the diagram off the library, don't worry.  Lots of
people don't like electrical problems, however, you have done everything
right up to now.  Just keep using your head for something besides eating and
you'll have this done well in no time. 

B dash light come on
Different issue for minds greater than mine....

My turn indicator assembly has always been loose on the 
steering column, and my left indicator does only work when I move it, 
 there's a problem with the catch for lack of a better word. 
Fix this next, others know more than me and will respond to this question as
a specific.
