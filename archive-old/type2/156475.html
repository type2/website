Umm, last time I checked, Mexico was part of America.  So is Brasil!  :)
There is a difference between &quot;US built&quot; and &quot;American built&quot;, which is
why Ford comes out with less US content.  Ford has a large operation in
Mexico, Toyota doesn't.  Ford doesn't really want to publicize that!

Most VWs sold in the US now are made in Mexico.  Only a couple of models
sold here are still made in Der Fatherland.
