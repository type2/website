Subject: Re: [T2] Timing Issues

Tom,
Like Karl brought up, I should have mentioned again that this is
assuming you have the correct distributor for that engine.

Without those vacuum lines, things change and you'll have to adjust
accordingly.  I think Karl says you're ok at 7.5 BTDC.

I haven't done the math on what kind of total advance that will provide
you, especially because I don't know what kind of distributor you have
installed.  My numbers were quoted under the assumption that you are
running a stock setup (I should have said that again in my reply).  If
you're not running a stock setup, you will need to adjust your timing
accordingly per the specs of the stock distributor that was used on that
engine model.

Mike
