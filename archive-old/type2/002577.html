&gt; Someone made a joke of this, but he's asking a serious question and
&gt; derserves a serious answer. John Muir strongly cautions against ever
&gt; jumping a FI bus, saying you can fry the FI brain by so doing. But people
&gt; jump them all the time.

Well John Muir himself said he didn't know much about the FI and I tend to
agree with him.  Let's just leave it at that.  Jump-starting a fuel-injected
VW is no different than any other EFI car, which is to say all of them if we
are talking of modern cars.

As a matter of good practice I would shut the engine down on the vehicle
with the good battery before connecting the battery cables but I would do
that with any car and not just with FI VWs.

I can't see how this would hurt anything.
