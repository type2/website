Subject: Water tanks 

To All, but especially Camper owners in the US Pacific Northwest...

We're finally getting some really cold weather, with lows tonight in some 
areas predicted to be below zero.  

After you've checked the antifreeze in your Air-Cooled VW engine, don't forget 
to drain your camper's water tank.

A frozen and split water tank, when it thaws out and melts all over the inside 
of your bus, is no fun at all.  Repairing them is difficult if not impossible, 
and replacements aren't available at your FLAPS.

Forewarned is forearmed, and that's half an octopus.....
