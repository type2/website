Subject: Re: [T2] timing the SVDA - resolved

&gt;LOL! I suspect that *everyone* on this list has probably switched
&gt;wires to the wrong place at some point...that's why someone said *check 
&gt;it*.
&gt;
&gt;Keep learning!
&gt;  
&gt;

Yup. Interestingly, an 009 cap will fit an SVDA. You'd think all you 
need to do is switch out the distributor and pop on the old cap (I was 
planning to do that because I thought my SVDA was acting up so I had my 
009 in the bus as a backup). But the rotor points 90 degrees  CCW in the 
SVDA compared with the 009, so while the mechanical fit would be fine, 
the wrong plug would get spark.
