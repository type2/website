&gt;you ever tried to change plugs on a 72'?

&gt;The front plugs are not way down under the tin like the rear ones, so they 
are
&gt;pretty easy to reach from the rear hatch.  No, really!  :-) -David

I agree, now having a 72 again I had to reaquaint with working totally from 
the back
but I get the plugs by using  two different size extensions on my 3/8 drive 
wrench
small extension for the back - just have to watch out for arthritis in your 
wrist when 
trying to twist the number 1 without causing any electrical arcs by letting 
the wrench 
hit anything.

So I lowered the 1800 on my floor jack but kept it inside there and back a 
little, wired
up the inside cv's, disconnected and dropped the 002, removed the bell 
housing and
transferred it over the 091 from a 78. Installed the transmission using a 
scissor jack
and a series of blocks of wood. (I don't recommend this method) Lets just say 
it would help to have your floor jack free here. 091 runs good on the 1st 5 
mile ride. forgot to change the input seal -ugh- and still have a small leak. 
Not too happy about that. This is the closest I've been on it since April 
when I got it, after it had sat since 1988. I've put 50 miles on it around 
the neigborhood with the bad tranny, and now 5 with the new one. Good 
acceleration - hold 4th gear okay. doesn't whine. so I'm toying with a labor 
day run up the coast to Rhode Island to see if it remembers the highway.
