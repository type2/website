Subject: free 77---&gt; actually a 78!  bus Update

&gt; Update:  The 77 has been moved from the Idaho
&gt; Panhandle to Portland Oregon safely.  Lots of little
&gt; things to do to get it back on the road.  It's VIN
&gt; starts with 238, indicating it is a 78.  

Funny, i was told it was a 77 :-)  The stamp in the
door says &quot;mfg 8/77&quot; or something like that, so model
year 78 makes sense.

&gt; Its motor
&gt; starts with the letters CD, indicating its a 72 17oo
&gt; dual carb.  

the engine i gave you with it was from my 72. It is a
hydraulic lifter'ed 1700 with a bad #2 exhaust valve.
The newly re-maned head came from Jim Arnott; i had it
r&amp;r'ed for $50 (that was with a few new valve guides
too). I would have no problems with slapping that new
head in place and calling it good. Needs new lifters
and oil pump too as i poached them for the 1800 i put
in the 72.

&gt; CV Joint boots in need of
&gt; replacement. 

inboard cv boots are new. wait, outboard may be too...

The tranny is from a 73 with 78 bh and nosecone.

&gt; Another
&gt; happy and involved Bus owner has just been born. 

glad that you are keeping it alive. That is what
really mattered the most to me. I would have hated to
see it parted out or crushed.
 
&gt; Thank you Matthew.

I was just the middleman, making sure she got a good
home.  

Cheers
