Subject: Re: Fair price to rent a bus

Den,

This idea was discussed on the vanagon list years ago. I believe it died a
slow and quiet death and that it probably will again.

I think it's a supply-and-demand thing.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;Been saving this up for a Friday....so here goes...
&gt;
&gt;What about a bus exchange program among the list...someone from CA wants
&gt;to holiday in Canada...I loan them my bus to them...when I want to
&gt;holiday in CA, they loan theirs to me...
&gt;
&gt;Or maybe we could do it on a rental basis...have a list like the airs
&gt;list for people who would be interested to rent their bus to a fellow
&gt;listee.....or his/her family
&gt;
&gt;What do y'all think??
