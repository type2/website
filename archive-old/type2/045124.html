Subject: [T2] Rain and help in San Jose area

It rained last night for the first time since May.

Woke me up at 4:30 it was coming down so hard.  I thought I was back in DC.
:)

Regardless, is their anyone on the list in the San Jose area who is familiar
enough with a 72 who would be willing to volunteer some time this weekend to
help me diagnose a bus that will not start?

I can be available Saturday, Sunday, or Monday morning/early afternoon.

Thanks
Rob Blumel
Currently Bus-less.(but hoping to remedy this weekend.)

Finally back in Connecticut after a two week trip to California, Arizona and
Nevada (bus stayed home).  Had a chance to meet with list members Harry
Houck and Karl (aufever) in Fresno.  Had a great time with them.  Harry gave
my family a ride in his 67 DC with
the Safari windows wide open.  Thanks Harry.  You can just imagine how
excited they get about a 71 Bay Window Westfalia after that ride.  Karl
explained the advantages of the Type IV engine and gave me demonstration of
what low end torque in a Splitty is all
about.  Karl, I didn't realize that Fresno had increased the speed limit on
Fruit Ave. by 30 mph since I left there 30 years ago.

Fresno is certainly the place for buses.  Unlike Connecticut where people
keep them garaged to protect them from the salt, Fresnans keep them in the
open and on the road.  And if you want to work on yours, just pull your
engine and leave it in the driveway
until you get time to finish the job.  After all, it's probably not going to
rain for another month.

Thanks to Harry and Karl.  I hope we can do it again sometime soon.
