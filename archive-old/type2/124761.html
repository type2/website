Subject: '79 windshield instalation question

My wife and I got the new windshield seal installed last night.
But it does not seam to be &quot;centered&quot; the &quot;lip&quot; of the seal is in the
correct position all the way around on the inside and out. My question:

Will the windshield &quot;seat&quot; itself?????
Is it safe to drive???

Thanx
MikeL
