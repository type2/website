&gt;Here are my requirements (or wishes - depends on what is achievable):
&gt;* I would like a little more power - enough to get me through the mountain
&gt;passes without lagging uncomfortably behind traffic (this scares my wife too
&gt;much) - we're talking 50-55 on most grades without overheating.

You should be able to hold 50 in third gear up all but the steepest highway 
passes with a healthy stock FI 2.0 in a normal-weight (3500lb-ish) bus.

&gt;* I want reliability and maintainability - read FI, hydraulic, engine that
&gt;lasts 100,000 miles with good maintenance (I see some 200,000+ engines on
&gt;the list, and the one that I took out of my bus last year had 201,000 - can
&gt;a rebuild last that long?)

Sure, a rebuild can last just as long as a new engine if good parts are 
used.  Any halfway decent rebuild should last 100,000.

&gt;Is something like this doable?  If yes, then suggestions on sources for
&gt;heads (Reichert?), cases (Reichert?),

Type 4 cases (unlike type 1 cases) will last indefinitely - you can re-use 
your old one.

&gt;valves,

Manley.

&gt;cranks (Demello? Scat?),

Dunno, but I'd go full-circle counterweighted, see below.

&gt;P&amp;C
&gt;(Mahle?),

Yup.

&gt;cams (Engle? Webcam?) etc... would be appreciated.

No experience (yet) with aftermarket cams but new stock cams will go a long 
way with hydraulics if taken care  of.  My stock hydraulic cam has nearly 
90,000 miles in my engine, plus unknown (but thought to be low) mileage in 
the previous owner's engine before it burned.  I'm very happy with the 
longevity of this VW of Canada cam.

&gt;This is starting to seem like way too many questions for one email, and I
&gt;still haven't touched on any of the stuff about
&gt;porting/polishing/unshrouding/CCing heads, CW vs. standard cranks, shot
&gt;peened rods etc... (ie what the heck is all of this stuff and do I need
&gt;it/want it?), so I'll sign off for now.

Porting - probably not necessary and has the potential to screw up your 
matched intake system.

Polishing - probably not necessary - only minor gains possible 
anyway.  Possible issues with fuel condensation on polished port 
walls.  Only exception might be polishing the combustion chamber - I had 
this done and it didn't hurt anything.  Supposed to decrease detonation by 
eliminating sharp edges which become hot and can spark preignition.

Unshrouding - I had this done and I'm happy with the results.  Supposed to 
allow the air to enter the cylinder more easily.  It's a low-risk modification.

CCing heads - definitely.  Helps balance the forces in your engine.

Counterweighted cranks help balance the engine which will make it smoother 
and quieter.  Definite win.

Shotpeening rods - this makes them slightly stronger but is unnecessary in 
non-race engines, IMO.

Anything else?  :)
