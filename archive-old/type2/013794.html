Subject: RE: [T2] intake manifold question
Mime-Version: 1.0

&gt;&gt; So in my gasket kit there are 2 of the thick plastic ones, and several of 
&gt;&gt; the pressed aluminum ones. I have a carbed 1800, single carb, it had the 
&gt;&gt; plastic ones in there. 
&gt;&gt; Should I just use the aluminum ones?

OH ENOUGH ALREADY. Come on folks the single Weber she has on 
the thing (I assume) has 2 metal &quot;intake&quot; gaskets per runner. What are 
they BUG EXHAUST MANIFOLD GASKETS. And yeah they are likely 
gooped up with silicone. They are likely thin stamped ridged aluminum.

OK you do not want to substitute FI gaskets (although they fit and are 
a very nice gasket) as they are phenolic insulators, the entire point of 
their existance actually. You could use thick paper gaskets that are 
one per side (with 2 holes per gasket and look like a thin FI gasket) 
but they too insulate. These are available for a couple bucks each 
and come in some Weber kits and appear to be a nicer solutions 
asthetically. What the PO did was in fact the best and cheapest 
solution on a single Weber. They used metal bug gaskets that give a 
nice heat transmission path up the runners to help with the Weber's 
notorious bogging problems. As to all gooped up with silicone, well a 
nice uniform coat of ultra-copper wouldn't hurt. New bug gaskets on 
clean heads and nice clean and level (unlikely) runners will work but on 
the intake a little silicone doesn't hurt. Excessive amounts not needed, 
just a 1/16&quot; bead around each side of the hole in the gasket. And 
FWIW I use a little Permatex 2A on even the FI gaskets, new or not, 
it never hurts. And I'm NOT one to use silicone very often. Another tip 
for the Weber is that about half of them have the runners welded to 
the plates that mount to the head welded on the INSIDE with big weld 
globbing down into the air path. I've seen some so bad I swear it looked 
like only a 1/2&quot; diameter hole open, and the runners are already much 
smaller than the FI runners or ports in the heads. If yours are like that 
it doesn't hurt to take a die grinder and open them up a bit. The ones 
welded on the outside don't have a problem obviously.

Enough already with this gasket talk.
