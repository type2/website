That's my stuff.



&gt;Just a question I am interested in...
&gt;
&gt;How do the glass stays on the windows? Is it just pressure on the rubber
&gt;seal? If I need to change a window glass (or seal), do I just have to
&gt;pull hard and then push very strong to have it back in? Is there any
&gt;special tool I need?
&gt;
&gt;I wanted to change all seals on my '76 bus (many are bit cracked), but
&gt;here in Italy there's no easy way; so I thought I could purchase seals
&gt;cheaper from USA (bus depot) and then do the work myself.

Andy I'm sending you a .PDF file that will explain it pretty good.
