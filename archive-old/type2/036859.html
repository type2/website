Subject: Re:  Re: Fwd:  Power at RPM

What are points anyhow :]&gt; ? I have a Hal unit on my dizzy. I have not
had the time to get into the fuel lines/filters/pumps and check everything
out and it's raining but I have been listening and noting a few more
things. OK if I am starting out, power seems normal, things seem a little
worse as the engine gets warmed up. Can I have an air flow problem? I
noticed that the idle is low and so during my last tuneup I tried to
get it up to 'bout 9000 rpm. Couldn't do it. So I tightened and replaced
hosing. Some one suggested checking out the aux air meter(not done yet).
Now I've noticed that at times the idle is really high (due to over compensation
because I couldn't reach the recommended rpm) so something is stuck or
regulating improperly. I need to look at my manual but it seems to me
that maybe the problem is that at higher RPM the air/fuel mixture is
too rich(?). Does this make sense, I am no guru mechanic (yet).
Thanks - CLW

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Current flow does not increase with RPM.  The points are still closed
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; the same percentage of the time, so the current stays the same.
&gt; 
&gt;  D'Oh!  Of course it does... The duty cycle's the same. What a stupid
&gt; thing
&gt; to write.
&gt; 
&gt;  My only defence is that the reason I make a habit of posting to the
&gt; list instead of P-mailing replies is so that people with brains will
&gt; pick up on stupid mistakes like this one.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, George.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
