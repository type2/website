Subject: Re: [T2] Anti-Seize

I have merely stated what a correct torue process should consist of, within
this post. I'm totally hardcore when it comes to torques, and specs, and
probably go off the deep end with my applications of them......I'm sorry to
have started an unrelenting thread of confusion, I will keep doing it my
way, maybe everyone else should do the their way. I will change my processes
and standards when I awake to 150+ engines that show up for warranty
repairs, until then........Not a chance.

&gt; Tommy-
&gt; If you are following the thread, you are now lost as well.
&gt; My response to the question of proper torque pressure
&gt; of a lubricated bolt was a question regarding whether that
&gt; was an accurate spec in light of the fact that a lubricant
&gt; allows the fastener to tighten easier, whereas a torque spec
&gt; is generally posted for a dry fastener. This was not a  suggestion
&gt; to only torque dry thread fasteners, but rather a &quot; twist&quot; ( pun )
&gt; on the subject insofar as i prefer to use locktite on critical
&gt; fasteners ( connecting rods and cylinder heads ) and no specs are
&gt; available for lubricated fasteners. The &quot;run-on &quot; torque adjusted
&gt; spec for fasteners which resist  turning can be generally reduced
&gt; by cleaning those fasteners, and the previous post pointing at
&gt; how engineers come up with these specs indicates that the torsional
&gt; stresses of various sizes and hardness and material of bolts is already
&gt; factored into the spec, and there is also some indication of the effect
&gt; of a lubricant, but it remains unclear if the torque spec is factored for
&gt; a lubricant. i believe it is not, it is for a dry fastener. I recommend
&gt; locktite and anti-sieze, and believe the torque spec is not accurate
&gt; for lubricants.see below.

&gt; &gt;Sorry to disagree Dave, but any bolt worth torquing should be lubed with
at
&gt; &gt;least some light lubricant! IE rod bolts, main cap bolts, head bolts,
etc.
&gt; &gt;The lubricant makes the threads turn smoothly and give a proper reading.

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;And when all threads are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;lubed w/ anti-seize, I have a better chance of getting meaningful
torque
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;readings.  I just put a brand new set of factory 16&quot; alloys on my T100
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;truck, and I sure wanted these megabuck wheels to be properly torqued.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Possibly not. Torque specs are generally intended for dry threads, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; slippery lubricants are fairly difficult ( i.e. impossible ) to spec
for
&gt; &gt;that.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Chances are you have more pressure than you would like on those wheels.
