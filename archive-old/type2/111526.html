Subject: Re: [T2] How do you set up your camp?

hahahaha ralph it is a long list and you can pick and choose funny thing is it all looks so great and needed LOL...
its really not...
you know who you are and what you like...?
right?
all is good you will have less questions on what to take after you first camping trip...
think of it as camping like as if you didnt have a bus and just were takeing tents...
what would you take...?
ok now imagine going in the bus... same thing but 100 times funner....&lt;sorry thats a word here in the sunny south... LOL

some sleep in the bus's some dont ,its the spirit in the air that is there when there is 174 other bus's around.....


I myself as far as what i learned and to your question how do i get all that stuff in there and stil have room for you?
well i like the idea of the trailer myself...
have seen some really nice ones and i thnk i am gong to build me one to pul behind the bus just for our camping stuff...
that gives us the room that we need to stil enjoy the ride and have room when we get to camping..

got lucky PO put a trailer hitch on my bus...

dont need a big heavy trailer but something no bigger or not much bigger than say a (motorcycle trailer pull behind)...

sorry to be so long winded...
peace

&gt;Cha,
&gt;    I have a '78 westy and eventually will camp some, but for now I am
&gt;still working on various problems with the camper. My question is with
&gt;all of this equipment how do you pack the bus and is there any room left
&gt;for you? I have never camped in a vw so any help is appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
