&gt; I told them some of the possible problems that all of you guys helped
&gt; me troubleshoot last week. Turns out they reinstalled the govenor
&gt; without cleaning it, which was in fact a professional pulling an
&gt; amateur move. They took it all back apart and cleaned it and now I'm
&gt; back on the road, with three whole gears, and no toxic ooze coming out
&gt; the back.
&gt;

yup that will do it....
glad it was an inexpensive repair.    well one of the troubleshooting
points was &quot;Govenor inproperly assembled&quot;
