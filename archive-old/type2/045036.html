&gt;Hi Eric,

&gt;At light throttle cruise you can run the full advance of 38 - 40 degrees
&gt;with the mech / vac distributor.  When you get into a load condition or
&gt;full throttle application, your vacuum falls to 0, or near 0, degrees
&gt;and you are in effect using only the mechanical portion of your
&gt;distributor which is engine speed dependent.

Okay, I just had to test this so I bought a 12ft length of vacuum hose this
afternoon and ran it from the carb/ported vacuum port on the left carb up
to the front where I could see it while driving.  I also watched the
manifold vacuum gauge that is built into my dash.

I guess you're never too old to learn, and I learned something new today.
It is just as Mike says - carb vacuum which is hooked to the vacuum advance
on my dual-vacuum distributor does indeed fall to zero as the accelerator
is floored.  My apologies for posting to the contrary in the past.

However I am left wondering about the logic of the dual-vacuum distributor.

With a mechanical-only distributor, everything is obvious - I won't bother
repeating the behavior.

With vacuum advance only (hooked to carb vacuum), it is also pretty
straightforward.  You get more advance at part throttle and less at full
throttle.

With vacuum advance *and* retard, things get a little hairy.  The reason I
say that is that I just observed that, above idle, the vacuum advance and
vacuum retard are (as Mike mentioned earlier) roughly equal - in other
words, they cancel each other out, leaving the only difference between dual
vacuum and mechanical-only to be lots of timing retard at idle.

This is assuming that one inch of vacuum on the advance side equals as much
timing advance one inch of vacuum on the retard side does timing retard.
My gauges showed roughly 2 inches more manifold vacuum at all times except
for WOT (Wide Open Throttle) and idle.  If the above is true, then there
should be a small net timing retard during part throttle with a dual vac
distributor, compared to a large net timing advance with the single vac
distributor.

Another interesting finding - the port that I thought would be carb vacuum
on the right carb (which I have always had plugged) turned out to be
manifold vacuum!  Very strange.  Not sure if it's a problem, or normal, but
it doesn't matter since I don't use it anyway.
