Subject: Group paint jobs - POR 15 Corrosion Control Process

Hey - it's the next VW show contest. How many people can you stuff in a big, engine blow, push racing busses, and speed painting... Clouds of overspray landing on 149 show cars.... Bet it's hard to get off of Hartz cloth convertible tops and sunroofs.

Oven? Who needs a stinkin' oven? &lt;grin!&gt; We just wet down the dirt driveway and start spraying... 

Seriously, Dad and I have done a few gorgeous hot rod paint jobs on the concrete driveway. Of course it is painting by 9 AM and then push it in the garage. He likes 15 coats and ALOT o' rubbing it out between coats though so a bit of dust gets worked out. I'm not that patient.

I think this would be a neat idea--

Who's supplying the bake booth??
