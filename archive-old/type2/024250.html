Subject: Re: [T2] R12 Availability?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

R-12 is still available, only it's way too expensive.  It's much more cost 
effective to go with the drop in refrigerant, Freeze 12.  And don't buy into 
that ozone crap, all refrigerants are much much heavier than air.  Anyone 
should also be aware that working on your air-condioner without a license 
carries a VERY heavy fine.  It should be done by a trained technician, that 
can recover old refrigerant.
