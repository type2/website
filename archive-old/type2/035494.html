&gt; How did it work?

Hey there Mark and listees,

The table fits into two small brackets that are mounted on the dash.
These brackets are the same as the ones that the straps on the stool
hook into on the seat pedestals (so the stool doesn't take off under
heavy braking). The table is supported by a leg (the leg has a
locking &quot;button&quot; mechanism to keep it attached to the table). And the
table is stored behind the drivers seat using a bungee cord thingie,
when not in use. 

If you've seen a late westy deluxe dashboard, and wondered what these
brackets were for, it's for the front table.

By the way I'm looking for the stool. Isn't everyone? and the front
table leg among other things. (shameless plug) See my webpage and
click on the &quot;swap area&quot; button for details.
