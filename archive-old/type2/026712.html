&gt;&gt;Has any one ever replaced their type 4 thermostat with a Type 1
thermostat?

&gt;David, it is easy.  The difference is that the type 4 has a male end onto
which the deep nut that holds the cable fits, while the type 1 has a female
end.  So you get a little bolt that fits into the type 1 female end, then
take the type 4 deep nut, thread the cable through it, and weld the open end
of the nut to the head of the bolt.  I gas welded mine, but mig or even arc
welding would have worked fine.  Works great!

Having recently clarified that the thermostat I received from VW Canada was
indeed the right one for my Type 4 engine, I would only add to this thread
that the two thermostats open at a different temperature (65C for Type 1 and
85C for Type 4).  So while you may be able to physically fit a Type 1
thermostat on a Type 4 engine, there may be a resulting difference in engine
temperature or warmup time.  I have no idea if this difference would be in
any way significant.  However, I would expect that having a Type 1
thermostat in your Type 4 engine is better than having no thermostat at all,
if your present one is faulty.
