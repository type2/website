Subject: Re: Gauge Fogging Problem

Yup, the light fogging happens on Itch as well. But, the left and middle
gauges aren't really mounted tightly (that's where the fogging occurs), so I
figure that's the problem. The right gauge (A vdo tach) is mounted solidly,
and doesn't fog.

I've been talking myself into taking the dash apart to lube the speedo
cable. Might do it this W/E, and tighten up the gauges while I'm at it.

Which brings me to this question: Should I tighten the gauges only when the
humidity is low?
