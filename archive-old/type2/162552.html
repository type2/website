&gt; VW 's goal with FI in North America was improved emissions. In markets

&gt; offer dual-carbs, and FI was optional. Heck, they even continued to
&gt; offer a single-carb'ed 1600 well into the Vanagon era.

I thought the dual carbed engine was not a 2liter engine??  I know that
outside of North America the 2liter was an option but I thought it was
alwaays fuel injected.  unlike the 1700, 1800 engines that came either
ways


&gt; If you're going to FI from scratch, it's worth considering MegaSquirt.

probably true,' waiting for the Megasquirt guru on the list to chime in
