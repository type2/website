Volks,

For reasons I would prefer not to go into, I want a show of (virtual)
hands...  How many of you have ever opened your door onto the hood of the
next car over and left a paint scratch?  or worse, opened the door, gotten
in and had it stick on the hood of the neighboring car?

What can I do about this????  Any suggestions on how to pad the bottom of
the door?
