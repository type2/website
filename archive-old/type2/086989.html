&gt; &lt;Close up all of the heater system - you are loosing cooling air to the

&gt; Are you talking about the hoses from the electic fan to  the heating system?

yes

&gt; What about the heating system under the bus? If it is not hooked up to the ducting, should it be blocked off?

nah, that is &quot;after engine cooling air&quot; so as long as it isn't blocking
the flow of air it is harmless if it leaks, of course you won't get much
heat up front either

 I totally removed the heating system from my 78, and blocked off the air
ducts on the cooling input side.  still runs cool, actually a little
cooler than before but very unscientific since other things were done
