Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny innerchange

Rex,

Jake is basically right, but I did manage to shoehorn a '79 trans and '80
block (with '78 heads and exhaust and '78 clutch assembly) into my '73
body without changing the bell housing.  He is very right that it is a
PITA in the hanger department!  Probably would have been easier if I had
used (or had for that matter) a '73 bell housing, but I didn't and
couldn't switch them.

The later trans is 1&quot; longer than the earlier one.  The body of the trans
is the same length, the shift housing at the front is 1/2&quot; longer and the
bell housing is 1/2&quot; longer.  There is enough slack in the adjustment
plate in the front under the shift lever so that if you flop bell
housings, you can compensate.  If you retain the late bell housing, you
are going to have shifter problems.  In addition, the '73 hanger is subtly
different than the later hanger.  I could and did flop in the later hanger
which probably saved my bacon.  I was installing not only the later engine
but the fuel injection, and the tube for the throttle cable comes out in a
different place for FI and Dual carbs, so I hadda, but there were other
differences as well.

&gt; Yes it can be used, in almost every type of interchange, as long as the
&gt; bellhouse matches the engine, and clutch system you are using
&gt; example:
&gt; a 79 trans will fit into a 73 bus, if you swap the bellhouse, from the 73
&gt; trans, and use the 73 clutch components, and starter.....
&gt;
&gt; One problem I have had is installing a late bellhouse and clutch set up, on
&gt; a 74 bus, with the 002 trans....it will work, but is not fun, as the rear
&gt; hangar mounts have big clearance issues....I did it in my bus for the 228 mm
&gt; clutch, for the Powerstroke engine, and pulling big loads..
