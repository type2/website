&gt; In the Bible (oh-oh, the &quot;B&quot; word!) Christians are exhorted to obey their
&gt; government unless the government insists that you do something that clearly
&gt; goes against the Scriptures.  The speed limit falls into the &quot;obey&quot;
&gt; catagory.  So I drive the speed limit.

yeah that and speeding tickets.

&gt; What do you do when you have to make an emergency manuvuer at 85+?!  A
&gt; flying bread box is still a flying bread box!  I'd be terrified to think of
&gt; making a violent manuvuer at over 70 mph, let alone anything higher.

wouldn't know. don't go that fast.  heck as crowded as roads are around
here if the interstate is doing 55 it is a good day

&gt; You've saved roughly 5 hours travel time, but why do we drive buses in the
&gt; first place?  To get there, or to get there without blurring the scenery as

well I just like em.

&gt; we drive by it?  And while at any speed over 35 mph, you stand a good chance
&gt; of severe bus damage and injury in an accident, at 85 mph you're almost
&gt; guarentted a totalled bus and death.  Hmm... has anyone survived an accident
&gt; at 70 mph+?

well yes, I was sideswipped by a truck at about 60mph or so. the tractor
trailer driver fell asleep and drifted into my side.  lets just say a bus
going backwards at 60mph is scary to say the least.  thank whoever you
want a well placed guard rail kept me and my bus from going over an
embankment.  I was unhurt and the bus was surprisingly little damaged..but
not something I wish to repeat.  passing trucks is white knuckle now and
that was over 10 years ago....
