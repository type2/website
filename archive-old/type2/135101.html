Subject: RE: [T2] 'Remanufactured by Bosch' Alternator

&gt; I know that it is probably cheesy to inquire, but with only a
&gt; 1 year waranty, why should one spend $100 or more for a
&gt;  Bosch rebuilt when thay can get a rebuilt alt from Advance
&gt;  for $58 with a 1 year warranty?

The length of the warranty is not always a strong indicator of build
quality. If it were, this would mean that a Hyundai is better built than a
Rolls Royce.

&gt; I know some will say that it could be dead out of the box,
&gt; but you can just get them to take it out of the box and put
&gt; it on the machine to test it.

The fact that a product works when initially pulled out of the box also does
not make it a quality product. It only proves that it is not completely
worthless. Half of the used alternators pulled randomly from cars in
junkyards would meet the above test. This would not make them comparable in
reliability to a fresh Bosch rebuild. (For that matter, half of the rebuilds
from junkyards, if they met that test, would simply be repainted, reboxed,
and sold as &quot;rebuilt&quot; by some low-budget rebuilders.)

There are good rebuilds and sloppy rebuilds. Often you get what you pay for,
warranty notwithstanding. Choose quality first, then shop for price. If your
alternator fails an hour away from home in the middle of the night, the fact
that it's warranted will be little consolation while you're sitting on the
side of the road in the dark with a dead battery and no headlights.
