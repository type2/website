Subject: Bumpers ideas

Hi all.

My 1969 van lacks bumpers.  
Anybody still growing these?

I have considered just getting some tubular steel 
put on the front and back.  I think that would look
cool.  I asked the guy at VDub folks in Irving Texas
and he went as far as to say not only could he not
get bus bumpers, didn't know of any local junky busses
that have bumpers still (!) and even that it's hard
to find somebody anymore that can make these tubular
steel bumpers and care about it (!!)  

That idea was for simplicity.  So much for trying to
keep things simple.  I'm afraid that I will need bumpers
for inspection.  I wont have them, and will be bummed.

But I'm going to the CIRCUS!!!
