Art,

The folks at Kennedy Engineered Products in East Palmdale, California
seem to have a lot of experience with these type of conversions.They
make adapter kits for many different engines. Their website is
www.kennedyeng_dot_com or email to kennedy_at_hughes_dot_net. I just received a
catalog from them for $3 which had a lot of pointers about VW
conversions and the price list for their adapters.
