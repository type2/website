&gt;So how does this bubba hook up?
&gt;I haven't hooked 12 volt to anything yet, but it has to get power from
&gt;some source.

It needs no external power.  The minute amount of voltage required to 
activate the gauge is supplied by the thermocouple, which is engineered 
into the ring that is supposed to go underneath the spark plug.
