Subject: Change Front Seal = Adjust End Play?

Hello Volks,

I'm trying to muddle my way through an engine pull that is continuing to
expand in scope.
After I adjusted the valves on the Adventurewagen, I developed a slow,
but steady drip when the engine was running.  It was obvious from the
amount of built up oil on the engine (particularly at the bottom front)
that I had several small leaks that needed to be addressed.  I pulled
the engine and stripped it  of its tin, heater boxes, muffler, and
engine hanger.  The oil cooler did not seem to be leaking, but there was
a considerable build  up behind the flywheel.  I'm still trying to
decide whether or not the push rod tube seals are leaking or the
moderate oil accumulation around them is from oil being blown around the
engine from somewhere else.

After an ordeal (two broken 1/2&quot; drive socket wrenches, one broken 1/2&quot;
breaker bar, and an ultimate trip to the local foriegn car shop which
graciously used an air wrench to remove  the gland nut - I had tried my
air wrench, but it didn't have enough a$$ to do it), I finally got the
gland nut off, leading to the following questions:

Muir mentions a rubber O ring behind (and inside) the flywheel which may
or may not be present, and another seal (paper or metal) that should fit
on the dowels behind the flywheel.  I have neither of these things.  My
understanding is that some engines have the O ring, some don't.  Is the
same true for the dowel seal?

Does end play automatically have to be checked/adjusted, or should I be
able to reinstall the shims that were there and go with it?

The engine is an &quot;H&quot; case 1600 DP.


Thanks,
