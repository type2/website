Subject: '68 bus tranny question

Help me! I am constantly arguing with my acquaintances about the '68 tranny!  I say it's a swingaxle, but others tell me IRS.  I know not to believe everything I hear, but the loud choruses of these people are clouding my judgement.  Please, a person to clear the air on this. 

TIA, 

Blake
