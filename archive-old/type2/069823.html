Subject: more mcodes 363?   025?  help

i checked the tag behind the seat on the 65 camper.  this is what it says

18  5          - may 18 production

363  020  024  025  056  175

2312  523643   5153944
- - - -
363  -?
020 -  speedo in miles
024 - sealed beam headlights, red taillights
025 - ?
056 - steering/ignition lock
175 - bumper guards

but it does not say  113 or 132 - hinged windshields.  nor does it say 090 -
laminated windshields.  so i must assume it came with the tempered
windshields, and someone later put in the hinged ones  with laminated glass
that it now has.   this bus has military base parking stickers on it, and i
think it was bought in Europe, ordered for the us standards.   it does not
have the louvered camper windows,    but i heard they were installed by VWOA,
so that would jive with  the history i am inventing. (it has two pop out and
four solids - yes a popout in the closet)

hmm - also no code for port sent to  ?

the sticker below it says:
                     ..
SAMTGRUN   L 512
Blauweiss           L 289                meaning    Velvet green below, blue
white above

the westy tag says:
Westfalia Werke KG
SO 42   1052    1965                   1052 is the production number.

the bus is a bench seat, no pop top
