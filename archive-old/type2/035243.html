Subject: Interesting FI idea.

I went out to this guys house to test drive a Vanagon and as the
conversation flowed I found out he new way to much about type IV engines. He
was talking about a bunch of history and gave me quite a bit of tips. The
real eye opener was when he showed me his turbo 2.4 liter sand rail. To top
it all off he was running almost all of the stock FI equipment from the
donor bus. When I asked him how he kept it from going too lean because of
the limitations of the delivery system he said that all he did was replace
the injectors with a model from a Chevy 3.8 V6 and modulated the fuel
pressure. 

I have wanted to build a 2.2 or 2.4 but have held off because most of what I
heard was that tuning the FI is impossible on a bigger motor. This now has
me thinking about it again.
