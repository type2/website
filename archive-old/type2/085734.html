Subject: Chuck's garage and the zen of VW maintenance (long)


Wow, I think I just ripped off Frank Zappa AND Robert Pirsig with that 
subject line!

I've been meaning to share with the list the story of a recent roadtrip 
undertaken with fellow listmember Jason Upper. Destination: Reno, 
specifically the homestead of Chuck Notmeyer and family, another listmember 
with a ridiculously beautiful collection of splitties and a recently aquired 
'79 Westfalia. The vehicles for this trip were my '71 and Jason's '79, both 
Westies.

The ostensible object of this 1,500-mile oddessy was the maintenance of the 
three bays ... with particular attention to the rear end. Mine was sagging, 
Chuck's was an unknown quantity and Jason's required some brake work. 
Chuck's invitation - &quot;Come do the work in my 6-car garage!&quot; was all it took, 
April being an unpredictable, soggy month in the Colorado Rockies and my 
only workshop consisting of a parking lot shared with 78 other tenants. So 
the buses rolled April 13. To Reno!

At the Utah-Nevada border on Highway 50 (not far from the store with &quot;Utah 
gas prices ... Nevada slots!&quot;) Jason's new 2.0 Type IV engine started making 
noises and running like a Geo Metro, that is, on three cylinders. List 
readers have already heard the story of the pulled rocker stud and the 
better part of that day was spent securing a tow to the nearest town - Ely, 
Nevada - a mere 30 miles away over several mountains transplanted from the 
Hindu Kush ... I've never spent so much time in second gear. Jason very 
reluctantly left his baby in the parking lot of a closed garage (closed 
because of course, cars only break down on Sunday) and we continued on the 
way, my bus several hundred pounds heavier and Jason's spirits about the 
same. We made Reno the next morning.

Our workload reduced from three to two buses, we figured this was a piece of 
cake and spent Monday afternoon diligently removing lug nuts. Proud of this 
success, we sat in Chuck's garage and drank the rest of the roadtrip beer. 
Outside, it snowed. So much for better weather in Reno.

Tuesday dawned cold and snowy (and Wednesday, and Thursday ... but by then 
we had adopted the language and customs of Eskimo hunters. Jason even 
dragged a walrus into the spare bay and skinned it, rendering the blubber to 
fuel the Coleman heater). On Tuesday Chuck joined the party and we began 
tearing apart the rear ends of both the '71 and the '79.

The sag correction was my first task and I'll admit I was a little nervous 
about the whole thing. I've noticed there seem to be a few &quot;mystique&quot; jobs 
associated with the VW bus, ones you stay up late at night worrying about 
for a week or two prior but which turn out to be no harder than your first 
tuneup was. This is one of them. The trickiest part was deciding whether to 
follow the &quot;don't raise it above spec&quot; advice or the &quot;crank in a little 
extra&quot; school of sag correction ... at that become a much easier decision 
when I measured the spring plates and found they *were* in spec. 
Nevertheless, my bus sagged a good inch and so I cranked in a few splines of 
adjustment, replaced the bushing with new, freshly powdered ones and put the 
covers back on. Done. Probably the easiest &quot;big&quot; job I've done on a bus 
(Once everything's apart, at least).

Chuck was by now working on his rear bearings and I joined him at the bench 
with mine, wondering all the time how many VWs go 30 years and 200,000 miles 
or more without EVER having the rear bearings packed because let's face it, 
who the hell wants to spend the aforementioned day tearing everything apart 
to get at them? (much of it, I learned, is spent banging on the brake 
backing plate, which has by now bonded cryogenically to its pin ... that's 
right, the pin that's not even mentioned in Bentley). But with the bus apart 
anyway, me unemployed and Chuck possessing many fine and wonderful tools 
(including beer) it seemed a good time to get the job done.

Speaking of the backing plate, I found mine to be heavily rusted - as were 
the shoes, springs, wheels cylinders and adjusters - from being driven 
without the rubber plugs in the brake adjustment holes. I kind of shrugged 
my shoulders at this until it came time later to adjust the brakes, 
whereupon I discovered the adjusters would not budge (I admit I'd let the 
rear brake adjustment go since I bought it last year). So, out they came and 
into the vise they went, where I cleaned them up per Muir's advice and got 
them all shiny and anti-seized till they slid &quot;like butta.&quot; Lesson learned: 
Little parts like rubber plugs are very important.

Put new Gas-A-Just shocks on the rear and flex hoses, too. They sure looked 
pretty, the new hoses. Bolted it all back up and bled the brakes. The 
garage, by the way, had started to feel like home and I took that to mean 
we'd better get going. By now the storm had subsided, the geese were flying 
north and time was running short (one of us still had a job to get back to, 
not to mention a bus in Ely) so we hastened to pack up the '71 and rolled it 
out of Chuck's garage.

The wheels didn't fall off right away and I was pretty sure I'd closed the 
bleeder bolts and thus figured it was safe to drive. That we did, all day 
long back to Ely where Jason's bus awaited. Next morning after a valve 
adjustment, Sweet Pea the '79 was chugging again and it did so all the way 
back to Aspen, at a velocity at least 8 mph faster than mine and probably 
quieter too. The Type IV is a nice powerplant.

Man, what people will do for the love of buses! Thank you, Chuck, for the 
generous invitation and Jason, for all the help with the rear end work. I 
hope this story inspires more listees to get together for bus-maintenance 
adventures. Just remember to bring one of those Inuit bone-scraping knives. 
You never know when you might have to skin a walrus.

Happy Friday!

Mick McQuilton
Aspen, CO
1971 Campmobile &quot;Luna&quot;

P.S. I'm off to New Orleans on Monday. It'll be the longest trip yet for the 
'71. Wish us luck!
