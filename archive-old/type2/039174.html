Mobil1 is not suitable for a VW transaxle, they say it right there, and i
have heard it elsewhere.  I have some in my 71, but will be draining and
replacing it with dino GL4 very soon, i have had some odd shifting
problems and attribute it to this lube. (i put it in before i did all this
research on gear oil.)

If you must have synthetic use Redline MTL, it is specified for GL4
transaxles only.

Take care,
