Subject: RE: Re[2]: [T2] Engine/tranny install advice

Just foward of the rear wheels or axles is where the torsion tubes are, 
similar to bugs.  I have always found this to be a great place, nice and 
sturdy and round to sit down in the stands.

Good Luck,

&gt;Get both sides up a &quot;safe&quot; height and on jackstands (&quot;safe&quot; may not be
&gt;quite high enough to roll the engine under -- I'm taking off the air
&gt;cleaners but not the carbs).  Then, take one rear wheel off and roll the
&gt;engine in through the opening.

&gt;I probably will go next door (lumber yard) and buy 6' of 4&quot;x4&quot; so I can
&gt;span the bus and use the jack just forward of the rear wheels to get up on
&gt;stands.
