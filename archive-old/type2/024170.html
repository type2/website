Subject: Exhaust Leak

Howdy Volks - 

I recently reported a new noise emanating from my newly rebuilt '77 2.0
liter FI engine. A fellow listee suggested an exhaust leak, and recommended
stuffing a rag in the tailpipe to find the leak. Sure enough, by just
holding my hand over the tailpipe, I can force the exhaust out of the
leaking area. Unfortunately, I have not been able to pinpoint the leak, as
there seems to be excessive airflow all around the underside of the engine.
So my question is this: assuming the worst location for an exhaust leak -
where the exhaust manifold bolts on to the head - what will happen if I keep
running it without fixing the leak? I'm just getting ready to go camping and
don't want to pull the engine again just yet .Thanks in advance for all
advice.
