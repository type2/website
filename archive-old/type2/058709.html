&gt;For all you real and virtural campers out there.
&gt;
&gt;I have the 120V outlet in my 77 bus.  I am preaty sure that this is hooked
&gt;up to the second battery.  My question is how much use do you all get out
&gt;of that outlet?  I assume that since the battery is 12V you are sucking
&gt;watts 10 times faster than a 12V appliance.  I am most interested in
&gt;laptops-computers that is, not pets.

     That outlet lets you enjoy 120v shore power without having
     an extension cord trailing in the Westy vent wing... there's
     a socket on the exterior of the bus that allows you to plug
     an extension cord into it. Then you can plug stuff into the
     120v socket. Otherwise it has no bearing on the battery or
     batteries.

     You would want an INVERTER to use stored battery power to run
     small appliances while disconnected from shore power.

     I had a 12v socket installed on the closet door plate of the
     '76, ideal location to plug an inverter into for laptop use, etc.

&gt;One more thing, what sort of lighting set ups to people have.  I have a
&gt;feeling that I am getting into something big here...  I have the little
&gt;floresent on the drivers side, but I would like to get a good bright
&gt;light(12V?) to read with on those early winter nights.

      I've been VERY happy with a 14&quot; flexible neck 12v light from
      West Marine, have it on the side of the Westy 74-49 closet
      cabinet, it's ideal for reading in bed.
