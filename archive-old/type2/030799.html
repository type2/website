&gt;All the main bearings are seated correctly in their saddles.  I'm
&gt;beginning to worry that the align bore is not straight or the crankshaft
&gt;is not straight.  How can I verify this?

BINGO!

The same thing was happening on my engine, Dave Easterwood can vouch for
this, it caused TWO catastrophic meltdowns.

Moral:  Let someone who REALLY knows how to align-bore do the work.  

Good luck!
