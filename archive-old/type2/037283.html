John,

Yes and no, more or less :-) I definitely agree that his compressions are
good, no question about that. And if it were me, I would do the gas hose
and PR tube seal switch and call it a day.

What lead me to recommend the valve guide check was his statement that he
was going to retorque the heads. Now, I am *hoping* that he meant that he
was gonna pull the engine, remove the tin and retorque *all* the head
nuts.  Once he has the engine that far apart, I recommend the valve guide
check because I have seen engines that had fine compression, good power,
and were eating PR tube seals.  Leaking oil all over the place.

My theory (and it is just a theory) is that what is happening in these
engines is that the valve guides were shot.  This has no effect on
compression, but you get a fair amount of blowby and this pressurizes the
case past the ability of the the crankcase ventilation system to pass it.
Once the case is pressurized, the seals start to pop and the engine gets
messy real fast.  Since having the guides checked when the tin is already
off costs &lt;$50 for the shop, and &lt;$5 for new cylinder seals, and he has PR
tube problems already, I think it a valid check, yes?  If it turns out
that his guides are shot, then new guides, installed, are &lt;$200 at any
decent shop.  *Way* less than a new set of heads!  and way less
frustrating than going around on PR tube Seals 4 or 5 times.

I agree that bad seals or bad installation can cause the replacements to
leak right out of the box, but I have gone full bore on replacment with
negative results as well, and think this might be the cause.  I also think
that shops know this is the cause, as I know of no shop that will
guarantee this job.  Everything else, yes, but PR tube seals... no.  I
wonder what they know that I dont?
