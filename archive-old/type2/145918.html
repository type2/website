Subject: Re: [T2] Steve Dolan is right again.  Was Fuel pump runs and
  runs

&lt; My next step is to check for voltage at the pump itself&gt;

Bingo! My vote is for that step. 

See if you can get it to briefly fire with a generous squirt of WD-40 or other flammable spray. My guess is that all is well except the fuel supply. 

If it will fire with a spray then you can say you've confirmed ignition and the mechanical condition. 

Usually takes a long spray into the air cleaner which the engine is cranking. Never a problem for us but keep a fire extinguisher handy and the bus not in the garage.
