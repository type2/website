Subject: ignition lock

For the benefit of anyone else having similar problems, I discussed the 
situation with Ron about his bus sticking in the start position.  It was my 
belief that the problem was not in the lock, but in the electrical portion 
of the assembly.  After he removed the electrical switch from the housing, 
the lock functioned as it should.  Ron noted that the spring to return from 
start to run hadn't worked in a while.  I feel like the spring moved around 
in the switch, jamming everything.  The fact that the lock worked fine 
without the switch in place tends to validate my thoughts.  Ron's searching 
for a new electrical assembly now, and should be back to normal as soon as 
that's installed.
