Subject: FI connectors: thanks

Thanks to Karl and the Blackhams for pointing me to the Bus Boys catalog as
a source for electrical connectors for my L-Jetronic. The catalog even has
a drawing of the exact part I need. This  Once again, I 'm amazed at the
info and the helpfulness of people on this list.

By the way, the hyphen in the Bus Boys URL is important.

Jack
