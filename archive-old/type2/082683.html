&gt;  
&gt; &gt; Thx for the info.  So what's it cost for a 1640 you describe? 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Mmm, well here's the catch as usual.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm actually in Australia but I can give you some idea as to the cost
&gt; of a long block 1640 or 1641(which is practically the same).
&gt; 
&gt; Here are some prices from February 2002 Hot VW's.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Strictly Foriegn in Grants Pass, Oregan has 1641 long blocks for US$1299
&gt; outright, only $40 more than a straight 1600.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Closer to home for you is Audirac Headflow Masters in Vista, California.
&gt; 
&gt; They do a 1641 with counterweighted crank, Engle or Schneider race
&gt; cam, shuffle pins(whatever they are?), 8 dowel flywheel, solid rockers,
&gt; full ported&amp; polished heads &amp; full balancing for US$1395 exchange....a
&gt; great deal if you really want a well built engine.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; There is also Strictly VW in Irwindale, California who do exchange
&gt; 1641's for US$689.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; And Rogers European Engineering in Downey, California does a 1640 exchange
&gt; for US$610.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Here is where I say &quot;Caveat Emptor........let the buyer beware.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; All of these companies may be reputable &amp; you may well get a good engine
&gt; from all of them.
&gt; 
&gt; Having said that, check your sources VERY carefully.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately there are also cads &amp; one particular Australian firm
&gt; who builds exchange engines are the most unscrupulous operators I'm
&gt; aware of still in business. 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone on the list I'm sure could point you to a decent engine builder
&gt; in the California area(Yes, I know it's big) &amp; if you are going the
&gt; after market FI/supercharged route, you will need to discuss carefully
&gt; with anyone who is building the engine what specs will give you the
&gt; most power to engine life ratio.
&gt; 
&gt; The supercharger &amp; FI may seem like a big outlay to begin with, but
&gt; once you have them you can go on using the system practically for ever
&gt; &amp; if you use a late model Japanese s'charger from a Toyota, for instance,
&gt; they are clutched &amp; can be programmed into the FI management computer.
&gt; 
&gt; As I say, what may seem a little crazy to begin with, may with some
&gt; custom made items become an amazing set up that suits the bus much
&gt; better than the later model engine.
&gt; 
&gt; I must stress at this point that while Judson's are cute, they are
&gt; little better than a gentle breeze compared to modern superchargers
&gt; &amp; were made to placate the 1950's US market, not make VW's into fire
&gt; breathing monsters.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; I run a 2.0l engine that cost me AUD$4500 to have rebuilt at the end
&gt; of last year.......a devastating figure that I still have trouble explaining
&gt; &amp; I know that my mechanic lopped a lot of the labour off the price
&gt; to keep it down.
&gt; 
&gt; The engine runs well, but it is no beast despite the fact it has some
&gt; internal tweaks to make it run better.
&gt; 
&gt; Standard VW engines are over-engineered, a characteristic that makes
&gt; them perfect daily drivers, but it also means with the low compression
&gt; that you can do things with low boost forced induction (say between
&gt; 4 &amp; 6 pounds) than with higher compression engines &amp; still keep the
&gt; longevity &amp; reliability of the engine.
&gt; 
&gt; The case remaining standard is also a fundamental factor in this set
&gt; up &amp; as such the extra 41cc should be a gain without a catch.
&gt; 
&gt; Check it out &amp; see if you can find a mechanic who has done this sort
&gt; of thing before........there are certainly turbos out there so there
&gt; should be someone who knows about this kind of build.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Please, is there anyone else who can say a yay or nay to this or at
&gt; least make some suggestions.
&gt; 
&gt; The parts situation in the US is much different to Australia &amp; there
&gt; may be other options or kits made for this express purpose.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck &amp; I really hope this works out.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
