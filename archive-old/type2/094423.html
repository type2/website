&gt; no accidents/violations on our records.

The latest Consumer Reports has a report on insurance and it basically
states that rates have risen not because of an increase in accidents or 9/11
but because the stock market has fallen and the investments they use to
offset the cost of underwriting can't support the current premiums.
