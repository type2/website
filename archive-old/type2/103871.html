Subject: Re: [T2] Propane stuff and tips

LOL! Well, welcome to the new age of Lawyer-generated paranoia ... we
doctors get constantly hammered with horror stories of malpractice
suits..... it's like you have to do blood tests to treat a hangnail because
perhaps the guy is a hemophiliac (bleeder) and you could get sued...
although it would be a highly unlikely event.

I quote one of my favorite philosophers, Bertrand Russel:
&quot;In this life certainty is not possible. In real life, one has to learn to
act on probabilities; suppose you were a general preparing for a battle, you
don't know what the enemy will do, you GUESS ...and, if you are a good
general, you guess right and a bad general, you guess wrong&quot;

So, I'm guessing that the chance of an overfilled disposable  propane
cylinder exploding is pretty remote.... if it does fail, either the cylinder
valve will leak and stink of propane...or the built-in pressure relief valve
will open up and it will stink and you can toss it.

I can't guess for you. That's your responsibility. You do your own guessing
and live with the consequences. And. if by odd chance you guess wrong
someday then perhaps I can help to mitigate the damage and restore any lost
function ...
