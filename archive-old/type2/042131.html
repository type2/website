============================&gt;
On vibrating objects (cars) use stranded wire.
Tin the very end of wire.
Cut the tinned portion to a desired length of just enough to make the 
connection.
Tin the connector.
Insert wire into connector and solder to connector.
Try not to &quot;wick&quot; the molten solder any further up the wire's length.
Come STRAIGHT out of the connector before bending the wire to the 
desired route.
