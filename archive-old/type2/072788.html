List-
I got a great response to my brake pedal question last week. (Thank you all
for that.) I had replaced a leaking master cylinder and still had a spongy
pedal.  Everyone suspected the rear brake adjustment was off and if I fixed
that it should solve the problem, and they were right.  The brakes (and the
parking brake) are now working very well. David Schwarz said I could test
the rear brakes by pulling the parking brake out and then backing it off a
few notches then drive the Bus and see if the pedal was higher, it was.  It
was also suggested to loosen the parking brake cables before trying to
adjust the brakes. This was a good idea since I had them adjusted as tight
as I could get them and they still didn't work. The last time I adjusted
the rear brakes (last fall) I turned the star adjusters out until the shoes
rubbed against the drum and then backed them off. This time I turned the
stars out until the brake shoes were firmly pushed against the drum and
even hit the brake pedal a few times to make sure they were evenly seated.
I turned the stars as tight as I could get them, then I backed them off.
The result was much better. I think this forces the other end of the shoes
against the wheel cylinders and forces the extra brake fluid back into the
lines since it is not needed to make up for the looseness of the shoes. I
hope this is helpful to anyone working on rear brakes.
Thank you.
