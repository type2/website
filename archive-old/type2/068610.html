Subject: Re: changing oil screen

&gt;I am very new at this, so hopefully you all won't find this too 
&gt;elementary to respond to.  I just bought a '67 bus a few weeks ago and 
&gt;noticed that the oil light flickered on when I started the motor. &lt;snip&gt;I
decided to take out the plate that covers the 
&gt;oil screen, thinking the screen might have been really clogged up.  &lt;snip&gt;
They said that what I 
&gt;pulled out of the motor was garbage, and the weird, apparantly home made 
&gt;oil filter was probably restricting oil flow and causing the oil light 
&gt;flickering.&lt;snip&gt; Unfortunately, the new screen would not 
&gt;easily push into place.  I'm guessing that the hole in the center of the 
&gt;screen is suppossed to be pushed onto the pipe in the motor, but it just 
&gt;doesn't seem like it wants to go.  I tried hammering on it but I ended up 
&gt;distorting the filter without really squeezing it into place.  Tommorrow 
&gt;morning I'm going to buy a second filter, but before I bash it up again, 
&gt;could anyone give me any hints about how to make this go more smoothly?  
&gt;If this question seems too elementary to answer on the list, I'd sure 
&gt;appreciate a personal reply.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

 No hammering or prying etc is required.

 OTOH there are different size sucker tubes (whatever) for diff. years
of engines.

 My guess is that you have a late model engine and they are giving you a '67
screen.

 Get the engine number and have them equate that to the year.

 If they can't, get back to us. We can.

 One item, be real gentle tightening those nuts back on.
The number is 5 ft-lb. try to equate that to five pounds on a 1ft wrench. If
you screw that up you have real problems for a beginner.
