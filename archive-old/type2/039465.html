Subject: Re: missing at highway speeds

I'm worrying about a similar problem on my '82 Vanagon Westy.  Last night it
failed for a couple of seconds while cruising at 45 in fourth gear.  I
thought I had lugged the engine, but it had just died.  In recent months
I've had intermittent miss or hesitation at highway speeds and have changed
the coil and checked the points.  I'm thinking about changing the double
relay or a least carrying a spare. This is so disturbing...I lose confidence
in my ride.
