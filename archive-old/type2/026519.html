Subject: RE:  Obsessing on Dizzy, 009 timing (how far to set advance)
Message-ID: &lt;D3C18AEA0EA1D111B8DA00805F85E889011F8F83_at_dsntexsrv3.diasham_dot_com&gt;

&gt;So I decided to check the timing on the 009 (I hadn't as I have 
&gt;parked the bus waiting to put in a new stock), it is set at 8 btdc 
&gt;idle, it advances to about 34 or so at full advance.  The top of 
&gt;advance &quot;bounces&quot; around a bit 30 to 34 is what I could see.

The usual rule of thumb for 009 distributors on type IV motors is that they
should achieve a maximum of 28 - 30 degrees advance at about 2800 RPM.  If
you're seeing 34 degrees, you're a little past the safety zone and I'd
recommend retarding it about 4 degrees.  It will give you a little poorer
off-idle acceleration (which is why a lot of mechanics advance them
further), but it will cause your engine to run cooler head (and thus oil)
temps.
