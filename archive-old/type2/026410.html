Subject: Need Source: Tranny mounts ('72)
Message-ID: &lt;CDCJGGADDBFMAAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

My FLAPs can't seem to get bus tranny mounts for me through any of there suppliers ('72 bus)...and I can't find them listed anywhere.

I don't have the part for the front one (technically a transmission hanger, I think), but the back ones (2) are 211 599 431. I need all three if I can get them, but I'll settle for the back. One of my rear mounts is broken, so I NEED it bad.

If anyone knows where to get these, I'd appreciate the info. 

Thanks! Joe
