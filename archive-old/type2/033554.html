Is anyone in the Phoenix area that can check on this. I would hate to see it 
get crushed.

No dents-some rust-Interior Okay, had been converted by some one somewhere 
to a Pinto engine. It does not run. Transaxle and Clutch good Condition. It 
is in South Scottsdale
  parking lot. Great chance for a bargain. In 5 days it goes to a scrap 
dealer.Please make e-mail inquires to Rick at ask4rick_at_futureone_dot_com
