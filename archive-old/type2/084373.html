Subject: Temp Sender - Was:Re: [T2] AIRS visitors

The temp sender I got when I bought my gauge was the type that replaces
the bypass valve screw.  Sometimes on very hot days, if the oil temp
gets above 240 it will cut out.  Very distracting just when you want to
watch it the closest.

I wasn't aware of the sump mount until someone mentioned it on the list
here.  The bypass screw was the only thing that my local Veedub FLAPS
recommended.

&gt; 
&gt;    Odd thing about Peter's temp sending unit. It's mounted in place of
&gt; the bypass valve screw. VDO sender and gauge, but I've never seen one
&gt; located there, just the usual dipstick or sump mount. Could this account
&gt; for high temp readings?
