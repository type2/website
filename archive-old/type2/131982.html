Subject: fuel filler neck advisory

I took a peek at the fuel filler neck I put on 2 years ago and it gave me a
scare:

At the time this was all that was available. The shape was just like the
original but the rubber, like most reproduction items, is not up to job (my
buddy put that el cheapo clamp on and it didn't help matters).

I replaced it with the latest &quot;OE&quot; filler neck I bought from CIP1_dot_com.

FWIW, this new version has better mold markings than the other one and seems
thicker but the shape has been altered from the original:

You can see that it lacks the profile of the fuel filler pipe but otherwise
I think is an improvement. This one better last until the next engine pull.
