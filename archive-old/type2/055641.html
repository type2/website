Subject: Re: What Now?

&gt; 
&gt; Hi, Thanks to everyone who resonded to my earlier question.  I checked all
&gt; conections at my double relay and replaced the points and now my bus
&gt; starts up beautifully (although I don't know if it is because of what I
&gt; did).  However now it seems that when I depress the gas pedal it revs up
&gt; but then stays there(sort of cruise control).  But then after about 5
&gt; seconds it returns to idle.  I checked the the throttle where the
&gt; accelerator cable attaches and it doesn't seem to be sticking at all.
&gt; What could be wrong?  This is my first vehicle so please excuse me if I am
&gt; asking too many questions but I can't seem to find an answer in any of my
&gt; manuals or anywhere else.  If anyone could point me in the right direction
&gt; I would realy appreciate it. Oh by the way it is a 1979 Fuel injected
&gt; Westy.  
&gt; 
It's supposed to do that.  This is controlled by the deceleration valve.
It makes the engine return to idle speed slowly, to help cut emissions
(specifically unburned hydrocarbons).  So as long as it returns to idle
in 5 seconds or so, don't sweat it.
