Subject: Re: [T2] hard data, and guessing games

At 09:48 PM 04/14/2002, you wrote:
&gt;This is a tough subject, and in no way shape or form am I a chemical
&gt;engineer, nor a physicist--I do not have a degree in mechanical
&gt;engineering, nor in metallurgy---
&gt;
&gt;  I reflect upon the the principal's of seat of the pant's experience--

Yes, please, outline those principles for us please. Just how low below the 
navel should the belt height be????


&gt;Same with Edison and the light bulb--Marconi with the radio, and a whole
&gt;broad expanse of other's in the early days of trial and error---zero
&gt;documented data---

You are so full of bullshit your eyes are brown. Every one of the 
substances Edison tried to make a filement from was written down. The time 
it took to fry was written down. The date of the experiment was written 
down. The amps draw during testing was written down. All data within his 
capability of measurement was written down.


&gt;And this is all I was attempting to convey to Tim and other's----
&gt;He is locked in to Mfg's recommendation and nothing else--according to
&gt;his prior statement's---
&gt;
&gt;If it ain't recommended by the factory --It ain't right.

You have clearly missed my message. You must distinguish between experiment 
(damn the cost, I want to do something different for it's own sake, or, I 
want my T-II to do something the factory never contemplated) and functional 
suitability for uses contemplated by the manufacturer. In the majority of 
cases when some toe-head wants to put a Rabbit diesel in his T-IV T-II, his 
purpose is to save time/money, cause he has a bum T-IV motor that will cost 
big bucks to fix and a scrap car with a motor he assumes is usable. He 
doesn't have enough money to hire anything. So I tell them, IF you want the 
vehicle to be safe and reliable for normal transportation (as contemplated 
by the manufacturer) whatever the cost to follow original specs is the 
lowest cost to get safe and reliable transportation and maintain the value 
of the vehicle, ie, USE IT to get from point a to point b without failure.

If you are experimenting to try to get around the actual time/money 
required to get safe and reliable, your probability of success is almost 
nil. You really have only two choices. Keep it as originally engineered, or 
do the engineering to modify the design. If time/money is one of your 
important criteria, the first option is the only rational choice. Trial and 
error is just another way to say experiment. Same thing. I encourage 
experimentation, but only if the time/money to follow through is considered 
RATIONALLY.  The point is, if you and a few buddies have among you 3 phd's 
in physics and engineering and economics and decide to make up a better 
design from scratch, if you have enough time/money you might come up with 
something viable for market. You still won't be a pimple on the ass of the 
Neandereers who have already demonstrated a world wide beloved design, and 
will sell to you at far less cost the results of their exhaustive 
development. If you want safe and reliable on the street, no matter the 
cost to make it all stock, that is the lowest cost to put vehicle problems 
behind you and receive the benefits of the safest and most reliable RESULTS 
possible.

With hindsight, is it better to spend $2000 time/money experimenting with a 
conversion, get poor results, then spend $4000 to do it right, or, just 
spend the $4000 to do it right the first time and be done with it??  Which 
method will typically end up getting results at the lowest cost in the 
shortest time??? How many of you were thrilled with the experiments of PO's 
on your new T-II when you got it home and finally got a chance to really 
look things over???

The best value of experimentation for the DIY'er is the knowledge gained. 
The knowledge of most value for the rest of your life is a real world 
lesson in economic reality.


&gt;  So with this in mind--and he being of the air cooled mentality ( today,
&gt;I remember when he was on the Vanagon list ), straight weight oil is the
&gt;optima best for you air cooled engine, no sodium or titanium valves, and
&gt;God help you if you convert your type 2 suitcase engine to hydraulic
&gt;lifter's, because the factory didn't supply them unit's with that
&gt;set-up---

Updates within the context of the original design are fine, as long as they 
are documented. Guy blows a clutch in his Westy. I tell him $xxx to replace 
it based upon stock configuration. I pull the engine and what I have is a 
1500cc T-III motor and clutch in an overloaded camper. Now it will cost 
$xxx PLUS $xxx to install a bigger flywheel and clutch and send him down 
the road with a very over stressed motor. Is this economic efficiency??

&gt;---it must be point's or bust, no platinum plugs,
&gt;because this isn't correct--and zero blue Bosch coils, it ain't factory
&gt;original----

You are just trying to warp the message. Please don't put words in my 
mouth. Search the archives all you want and you will find I never said 
anything like that. The Bosch blue coil is a proper, called for, correct 
replacement item for most of the earlier designs. It is a stock upgrade. 
Platinum plugs were tested exhaustively at the factory and found to provide 
a tiny measurable benefit at twice the cost, and only when used with later, 
high-energy electronic ignitions. Ergo, not approved. They don't provide 
enough benefit to justify the extra cost, not even close. Review the 
archives on after market conversions. Note all the problems cropping up 
with experiments originally conceived to save time/money.


&gt;All I'm trying to say here there are so many improvement's that can be
&gt;done to a Bus engine, including the use of Marvel, to increase the
&gt;reliability,and longevity,  of the air cooled engine waaaay beyond the
&gt;limits of the holy Bentley, or the factory issued repair manuals, that
&gt;are truly beneficial in the long run----

What an enlightened CLAIM. This list is great. We can get better info here 
than from all the Neandereers in Germany combined. Send this man $29.95 for 
the great savings and improved viability you will get from assuming he's 
right.


&gt;This is why I mention wearing blinder's in a prior message , regarding
&gt;this subject---- look beyond the stuck on stupid factory maintenance
&gt;recommendations --you'll be happier in the long run--and so will your
&gt;Bus---

Now there is a bald assed claim you can surly sell to someone. Anybody want 
to help this guy with marketing??? He's a millionaire spam artist just 
waiting to happen. Pull you pants back up, more than the crack is showing. 
Stupid is as stupid does.
