&gt;This is in my '72 that has a '78 engine and '83 fuel injection.
&gt;
&gt;I've searched can not....

What's with the 83 FI on a 78 motor? Does the engine seem kinda hot at idle?
Do you have a cylinder head temp gauge (yes I like gauges)? Anyway I could
be way off base and others out there will either confirm these thoughts or
come up with others, but it may be one of the following:

1) Faulty Temp Sender II, test this with an ohm meter. Should be located in
front of the #3 clynder with wire and lug coming off of it. Bentley says  at
68 degrees farenheit you should have approximately 2500 ohms from the
pigtail connection to ground.
-or-
2) Your engine is leaning way out at idle and the Temp Sender II is doing
it's job and telling the FI unit to shut me down before I melt! If this is
the case you should have a CO gauge to check the exhaust and adjust the
screw on top of the AFC (at least it would be an AFC on a 78 engine, don't
know about 83 FI but probably the same). If you want to fiddle with this
without a gauge... Get a piece of paper, mark the position of the screw and
count the number of turns it takes to shut the bypass all the way off, (mark
it down and fiddle), this would be turning the control screw clockwise and
as it happens enrichening the mixture as well. It may run rough with the
screw all the way in. If it does and the motor continues to run after five
minutes, you've probably found the problem. Put the screw back where it was,
get a gauge and do it right or do what I do and take to a trusted mech and
have them set the CO.
