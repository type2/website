Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder studs

dual port longblock to single port.
&gt;  I need the 4 inner 
&gt; upper longer studs 
&gt; aren't they the same
&gt; length as the outers?
&gt; 
&gt; Mad Uncle Dave
&gt; 
Going back to a single port , with the cyl studs 8mm
they are the same size (length) of the outer ones,
unless someone has a old set laying around you may
have to buy a whole set to get them. Phil
