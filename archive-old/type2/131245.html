Subject: Bus Paint Jobs Ocean County Vo-Tech

The Ocean County Vo-Tech, for Adults, has three levels of Auto Body Repair.
Auto body 1 for beginners,Auto Body 2 for those with some experience and Auto
Restoration for those who are restoring anything 20 years or older. All three
classes are $150.00 for 1 day per week for three hours for a total of 12
classes. All Auto Body classes are located at the Jackson facility located at
850 Toms River Rd,AKA rt 571,Jackson,NJ. All registrations take place in Toms
River NJ but can be handled over the phone at 732-473-3131 and the classes are
open to residents and non residents. The Auto Restoration class is either
Tuesdays or Thursdays 6:30-9:30pm and starts on either Sept 13th or Sept 16th.
I have been active with the Thursday night group for years and it's the night
the VW guys are there.Auto Body 1 or 2 are on Monday and Wednesday at the same
time. If you need more info for to www.ocvts_dot_org  and look under adult
education. You may want to check the Vo-Tech's in your county or surrounding
areas.
