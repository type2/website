&gt; Very nice.  Where'd you get that, hmm what to call it, cage around  the 
&gt; front?  Haven't seen one of those.  Might be useful in a  front end 
&gt; collision.  Cheers...KR

They're generally called &quot;roo bars&quot; over here Kevin, but the gaspipe ( 
basically 1 - 1 1/2&quot; galvanised water pipe ) roo bars were absolutely NO use 
in an accident, they're purely to hold the spare tyre as the
Supro conversions done for VW Australia have the bed over where the spare 
tyre indent is ( this didn't change in the switch from LHD to RHD, and hence 
it's on the &quot;wrong&quot; side for us over here ).

I still had my old gaspipe roo bar fitted when I had a minor bump a couple 
of years back, and a stress crack on the driver's side riser meant that 
there was just about no damage at all to the car I nudged, as it sheered and 
swung back to clout the front panel of my bus ( seemingly as soon as it 
sensed the proximity of something in front of it ;^)

FWIW
