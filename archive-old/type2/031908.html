&gt; Tom and Tom:
&gt; Uh, beg to differ with you, but the thermostat does not float in the
&gt; bracket! The thermostat is mounted solidly to the front of the bracket
&gt; with a short M8 bolt and washer. The rear of the thermostat then moves
&gt; the cable forward when cold and rearward when hot, thus relaxing the
&gt; spring tension on the shaft and opening the flaps.

Al's right and I'm wrong.  It's been a couple of years since I last 
messed with this thing, and I didn't have a manual handy.  That'll teach 
me to put my brain in gear before opening my big mouth!!  (How many times 
do I have to re-learn THAT lesson??!!)
