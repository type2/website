Subject: [T2] Friday quotation:

Hi, folks:

This was the Quote of the Day earlier this week at msn_dot_com:

     &quot;Art has to move you and design does not, unless it's
     a good design for a bus.&quot;  -David Hockney

Not entirely sure where he's headed with that, but it sounded good to me.

Have a good weekend, all.

Bill
Beaverton OR
1970 bus
