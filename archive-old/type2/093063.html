&gt;if the reliability of a NEW $10,000 vehicle is dependant on owning $10,000

Okay, fair enough.  The Saturn did not require any diagnostic 
equipment.  My late model Mustang which is also computer-controlled, 
requires nothing more than an understanding of the codes that are being 
sent through the flashes of the check-engine light.  A $20 book lists them 
all.  Code 87 means bad O2 sensor, code 43 means coolant temperature out of 
range, etc..  It actually makes it very easy to figure out what is wrong.

&gt;My definition of reliability:
&gt;if you can fix 80% of  problems that would leave you stranded, NORMAL every
&gt;day tools, and for less than $100 then its reliable.

Sounds like your definition was tailor made to fit the bus.  My definition 
has to do with unplanned stops on the side of the road, and by that 
definition my bus will never be as reliable as a modern vehicle.

&gt;when my kids leave for collage (no there not born yet) an Air Cooled BUS
&gt;will be my recommended vehicle of choice. for LOW COST reliability, and life
&gt;long lessons in patients and nurturing a good'ol type 2 CAN'T BE BEAT!

I love my bus too, that's why I've had it for 14 years now.  I'm not 
confident enough to say that my priorities won't change 20 years down the 
road though.

I have a feeling that this is about to turn into a religious argument that 
cannot be resolved, so I will try not to post about it again.
