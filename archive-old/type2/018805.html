Hi volks,
Well my 73 is being retired (getting hit twice in less than a month and
neither her fault) I figure the bus gods must be calling her home so on I
move.

I bought the 78 with sunroof.  And I have a couple questions that late model
owners would now.  Did the side center sliding windows come with a screen?
Also all of the glass in the bus is green was this stock?  The sunroof leaks
like a sieve and I was wondering if any had tried the seal from bus depot? Or
is it event the right seal? It is over $100 and mine has no seal so where does
it go exactly?
