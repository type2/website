Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Rookie Question about Valve Cover Gaskets

&gt; A few weeks ago I noticed the other side was leaking more and more

&gt; crooked and was only holding in oil by a hair, I had no reason to  
&gt; expect the new gasket to be a problem.
&gt;
&gt; After one 14 mile round trip to work I will now say it is leaking  
&gt; twice as bad as before I replaced the gasket.

&gt; Will somebody please tell me how to replace my valve cover gaskets  
&gt; one time so I can forget about them for a very long time?

To get leak free you need to observe the following:

* Gaskets

- the surface of the head has to be flat, clean and nick free (small  
scratches are ok, just not big ones).
- gaskets &quot;bake&quot; and need to be replaced. Sometimes they shouldn't go  
back on a 2nd time.
- the rubber impregnated cork gaskets seems to work better than the  
plain cork gaskets.

* Sealant

- grease (Muir method) is not suitable because it make the contact  
surfaces slippery and the gasket can move under vacuum:

WarpedGasket.jpg

- most engines need some kind of sealer to help the gasket seal.
- RTV type sealant just make a mess.
- Hylomar has been a good friend to VW owner's when applied between  
the gasket and the valve cover (other side dry). It's hard to find  
these days since Permatex that main importer dropped it when the mfgr  
jacked the price by 10x.

* Valve cover

- the valve cover side needs to be equally clean.
- beadblasting rusty old covers and repainting them is a good idea.
- repainting also provides a smooth outside surface for the bail to  
slide on.
- the gasket is held in place by the tension of the bail. As the bale  
ages, the rust penetrates and takes away some of its spring.
- using a new bail will hold the gasket in place much better than before
