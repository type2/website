Hi Pete,

&gt;I have a 2nd battery set up in my 71 Westy. I just had
&gt;my mechanic wire it up - I still need to go buy and install
&gt;a battery.

This should be simple, your mechanic should have left you a live low gauge 
wire that goes to the charging relay ?
If so you need to connect this to the positive side of your second 
battery...
Then connect the negative side to a good earth point with an earthing 
strap...

&gt;A question though...shouldn't there be a junction or fuse block
&gt;coming off the 2nd battery to make connections?

Yep - you now need to attach a second high gauge wire (I used a wire rated 
at 42 amps on mine! - incase you wire something in which draws a lot of 
current - we don't want any fires) to the positive terminal of your 2nd 
battery and run it into the interior and connect it to a new fuse box...
Now you can run your accessories from the fuse box with suitably chosen 
fuses...

&gt;Can you tell I'm electrically challenged?
:)

&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Pete
No probs...

Dave K.
