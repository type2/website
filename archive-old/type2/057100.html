Subject: RE:  wobbly axle

&gt; As I wiggled the CV joints to make sure there's no play,  I noticed 
&gt;that the flange that sticks out of the right side of the differential
-- the 
&gt;thing that the inner CV bolts to -- wiggles a little from side to side.

&gt;The other side has no wiggle. There doesn't seeem to be any noise 

This isn't really any help unless you believe there is safety in
numbers.  My 73 is like that too.  It's been that way for at least 2
years / 20,000 miles now (probably longer, that's just when I first
noticed it).  When I asked about it, no one gave me any kind of definite
answer other than that their's were that way also.  

So if you find out it's a big problem, please let me know since I'm
driving mine 2500 miles to Jerome and back next month!
