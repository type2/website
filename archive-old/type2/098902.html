Subject: Re: [T2] 'Tis The Season'--

&gt; The most direct access to the camshaft gear cavity is obtained
&gt; by removing the oil pump. The large round bottom cover at the rear should be
&gt; removed, and a rag pushed up inside to block the small
&gt; port to the right of the cam gear. The cavity is essentially blocked from
&gt; the rest of the case except through this port.
&gt; A magnet and compressed air should do the rest.

Thanks Dave! That just might do the trick. BTW, my German shop manual has
great pictures (seems different from the Bentley as it is an official '74 VW
shop manual covering the 1.6l, 1.7l and 1.8l engines exclusively. No confusion
with FI or other unnecessaries.

&gt; Or you could try standing the case on this end and shake it. ( Really ! :)

I just moved the engine from the floor to a pair of saw horses by myself. We
just might do some shaking!
