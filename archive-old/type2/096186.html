Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuilt heads needed

well I ordered some from Bus Depot and they gave me a time but they did
come sooner, you also can speed em up with higher priority shipping
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have a recommendation for another vendor who might be a bit
&gt; quicker? 

last time I did that, used the vendor that was fastest, turned out to be
the slowest because the quality was so low and had to redo the job.
&gt; 
&gt; Another option might be to get my current heads rebuilt -- anyone know

good to have a spare anyway

one thought would be to find a junkyard engine with heads, use them while
haveing your &quot;known&quot; heads rebuilt
