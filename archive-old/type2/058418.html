Subject: too lean or too rich...?

Greetings...

Quick question...

I'm presently in the process of fine tuning my 34 PICT-3 on my 71 camper.
Is there anyway to tell if the fuel mixture is too rich or too lean?

Bentley says that if the bus backfires when overrevving (downshifting at
high rpms), the mixture is too lean.  This seems in accordance with what
I've been doing.  

However, too lean or too rich both can seem to cause the engine to
hesitate on acceleration, especially when cold.  Is there any way to
differentiate between too lean and too rich, without the presence of a CO2
meter?

Thanks,

Tom
