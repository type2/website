Subject: Re: Aridzona Cake-off

At Corona de Tucson by the ABC there will be a &quot;Cake-off&quot; --but it will
not be the the type of cake that you take off your engine!!  hopefully.
--We would appreciate the pastry type of cake, that is, or will be close
to, edible  -- Winners will be determined by the extent of your
imagination and the taste buds of those present or left standing-
In case of a tie--duplicates will be awarded--
