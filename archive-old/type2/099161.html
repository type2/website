&gt; =====================&gt;
&gt; HI Susan,
&gt; I am aware of the &quot;problem&quot;, but ...........
&gt; I am not sure as to why this has seemed to be such.
&gt;
&gt; Have there been accidents due to the powder coating,
&gt; or were the accidents due to improperly torqued lug bolts that just
&gt; happened to be on powder coated wheels?

I was alerted to this problem by Brent Carter who did have an accident
that was
attributed to it.  As I understand it, the Bus in question went
something like a
thousand miles before the wheel came off.  After hearing the details I
started
checking my Bus.  After my first long trip most of the lug nuts had to
be
retightened some (not really loose but definitely worth checking).  But
after the
second trip only 1 nut had any give to it at all.  Compression of the
paint, as
has been suggested, may have been the culprit but going back around to
check all
the nuts after 500 miles or so seems to have done the trick.
