Subject: piston slap &amp; oil pressure

hey list ~ i'm experiencing a little &quot;piston slap&quot; from a cold start in my 2.0, ya know that little click-click-click before the oil reaches the pistons/lifters/etc. it typically lasts 5-8 seconds, which seems like a lot of strokes w/o oil pressure (VDO reads zero). so here's what i've done that *didn't* solve the problem.
(1) pulled the oil pump and spec'd the gears (OK).
(2) restored oil pressure relief valve spring to 
    correct length &amp; cleaned plunger.

&gt;&gt;so now i'm afraid my main bearings are &quot;bleeding   out&quot;, though i replaced them less than 4 yrs     ago...anyone else had this problem, have advice,   etc? what about the oil pressure *control*   valve? TIA!
