Has anyone used this mail order parts house.  Their prices seem to be good.
How is there service and delivery time.  I'm rebuilding a spare engine for
my 77 so I'm in the market for a few hundred dollars of parts..  Anyone had
any bad experiences here?

Thanks                       May the wind always be at your back!
