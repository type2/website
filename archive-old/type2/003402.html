Subject: Busses still for sale in S. Calif

I'm moving out of state and unfortunately I have to sell some of my vehicles
/ projects because I can't afford to move everything all the way across the
country.

Bus 1: 1969 7 passenger, 1600 single port, remove mounted spin on oil
filter, body is good, paint is good, I have rear bumper but it's not
currently installed, interior is complete but the upholstery is only in
fair - poor condition.  Runs good, drive regularly.  Asking $1950.00 or OBO.
Also I have a 69 parts bus here which I've promised to a friend but if
someone purchases my running 69 they are welcome to take parts off of it
that they might need.

Bus 2: 1973 pop top Westy (project).  Body is good, interior is mostly
complete, has tranny.  I purchased a 2.0 engine from a 76 to put in the bus.
Later on I was able to purchase the 76 bus the engine came from to use for
parts for the conversion, brackets, fuel pump, tank, etc.  I'd like to sell
the 73 with the engine and I'll include the 76 bus for the parts.  None of
the parts necessary for the conversion have been removed from the bus yet.
Engine includes all accessories, air cleaner, computer, etc, and was running
when removed.

I also have a 1974 Jeep CJ5 that I'll most likely be selling if anyone is
interested in it.

Email me directly if you are interested in pictures or more information.

The busses are located in Hesperia (Southern) California.

John
