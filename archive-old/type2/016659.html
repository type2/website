&gt;&gt; Under-capacity - yes.
&gt;&gt; Under-size? 195/75R14 is roughly the same diameter as 185R14 (An 80%
&gt;&gt; profile is implied in these tire sizes, although it is not explicitly
&gt;&gt; stated- like 185/80R14):

&gt;Actually, the implied section ratio is 83-86%, and it varies with the
&gt;manufacturer.  An 80% section ratio is not implied, which is why you
&gt;see it in tire sizes.
 
When I bought my latest Bus, it came with what appears to be an original
tire, used as the spare. 'Made in West Germany'. There was no difference
(Less than 1/4 inch) in circumference between this tire and my new
195/75R14's. The original tire even had a fair amount of tread on it, so
I doubt it would make much difference whether the 185R14 were new or
not. 

Also, I'm a stickler for knowing how accurate my speedometer is. It's
dead nuts on (&lt; 1% error) with 195/75R14's.

The 4% difference still does not hold water with me.
