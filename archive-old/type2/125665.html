Subject: Unknown Wires

Hi all,

 

As I clean up my '79 Westy Deluxe (a note, I have an under dash A/C that is
not working - more about that in a later post), I am finding many
unconnected wires and am trying to figure out where they should be
connected.  These is what interest today:

 

1- A heavy red wire in a black sheath that runs under the drivers seat
towards the dash - it has a fuse holder on the dash end with a spade
connector on the end of the fuse holder.  I've not taken the cabinets
(stove, sink, fridge, etc) out as yet to trace the wire.

 

2- Under the dash there is a round white plastic 'socket' with three wires
connected to it (blue, blue/white &amp; brown)  the three wires go into the wire
bundle on the steering column.

 

3- There are others, but I'll worry about them as I get to them.

 

I've checked the Bentley wiring diagram a few times and must be missing
something - your help would be appreciated.

 

Thanks for your help.

 

Wayne
