Hi,Im new to type 2's but I am very dedicated to VWs.I have recently purchased
a a 74 automatic. It sat in a barn for a couple of years an the carbs are all
gummed up. I dont know that I am experienced enough to rebuild them myself so
I called the neighborhood VW shop and they told me that they would'nt touch
them because there are bushings in the throttle body that will need to be
replaced and they cant do that there. They also said that you cant purchase
new carbsfor this model. I do know a little about cars and I am mechanicly
inclined is there a book that I can purchase to walk me through a rebuild.What
other options do I have.Keep in mind that I am a student with very little
money to throw around.I was also own a 83 Rabbit GTI. I have herd of people
putting 1.8L ford motors in their busses. Is it possible to put my rabbit
motor in the bus. If so where can I get a conversion. 	Thank you, Corey Harris
