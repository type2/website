&gt;A problem with this kind of survey is that there are variables affecting 
&gt;the validity of the data reported.

Standard set procedure requires throwing out data that varies from the norm 
beyond the stated precision. If you have ten figures between 17 and 23 and 
one of 12 and another of 27, you throw out the high and low and only 
mean/median/mode the rest. You use only the most normal 95% of the data or 
90% or whatever refinement the study calls for as stated precision/confidence.

2 sigma statements are used typically in most applied sciences with regard 
to sets of measures/observations. If more precision is required, more sets 
of observations are added until the 2 sigma confidence is proved within the 
maximum errors allowed.
