Subject: Re: [T2] gear to cam bolt torque?

We torque the aftermarket cam gear bolts to 14 Lb/ft
We prefer to use loctite on them also, as if it begins to loosen, you WILL
have a bad day..

Be sure and check the oil pump to cambolt clearance as well, FAT uses the
same gears as web, and we sometimes have clearance issues with the oil
pump..If you do have some issues you can always spot face the cam gear so
the bolt will countersink into it...No more than .030 is safe..

I hope this helps, good luck with that hydro grind.....

Subject: [T2] gear to cam bolt torque?


&gt; Does anyone know the recommended torque for the bolts that hold the gear
&gt; to the cam on an after-market cam? I purchased a stock grind hydraulic
&gt; cam from Fat Performance. I think they said 14 ft/lbs. but I cant
&gt; remember where I put the paper I wrote it on. Of course they are closed
&gt; for the holiday weekend and I'm trying to get my engine together this
&gt; weekend.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Tom
