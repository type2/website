Subject: Re: LED's and &quot;cocked locks&quot;

You have &quot;cocked the lock.&quot; right?  In order for you to use the lock on the
sliding door you must close the door and then cock the lock, that is pushing
the lever the opposite way of opening the door so that the lock will click
and then you can turn the little lever on the inside so to lock the door.
Did that make any sense?!

Subject: LED's


&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; After reading the thread on LED's I couldn't keep quiet any longer. I work
&gt; for Hewlett-Packard and one of our divisions manufactures ultra bright
&gt; LED's - in the colors mentioned AND in WHITE.
&gt; They also sell them installed in a little holder containing a battery -
its
&gt; on my key chain as an emergency flash light. No, I'm not kidding - its
that
&gt; bright.
&gt; Sorry, I don't know the specs, but I just wanted people to know that the
&gt; technology is out there.
&gt;
&gt; I also happen to own a couple of heavyweight American made motorcycles,
and
&gt; there are OEM replacements for brakes lights made from LED arrays.
&gt;
&gt; What we need is some EE to figure this out for those of us electrically
&gt; challenged.
&gt;
&gt; On a more on topic subject, anybody ever have to take apart the sliding
door
&gt; lock? Everything functions fine except the lock will not move.
&gt;
