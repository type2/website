&gt;My research indicates that the VW Bus calls for a Group Type 41 battery. . .

That's correct. It's large and has plenty of CCA for cold weather starting. 41 also means it's terminals are reversed (neg left, pos right) for engine comartments with the battery ground cable on the left instead of the right bolting to the battery tray.

Size 42 is basically a slightly smaller 41. That will work just as well.
