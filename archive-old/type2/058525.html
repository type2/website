P.S.  Is this common problem attributed to a) some type of water drain
issue?  b) Battery acid that accumulates on terminals?  c) Some electrical

metal here?

I think it is a mix of a and b. Water gets into the battery compartment thru
the air scoops. There should be a drain under the battery to let it out.

Small amounts of acid will be washed down with the water and eat happily
away at the metal. Note that the other side normally does not suffer from
the same problem (but keep the drain hole open as well).
