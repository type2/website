&gt;&gt;&gt;How did you end up doing that without risking the washers falling out?
&gt;
&gt;I spoke to Leonard at AVP who was very helpful and said that 1) there is
&gt;only one washer on the typeIV, 

Usually, but it depends.  My engine needed two to bring the drive shaft
height into spec.  You can run any number of washers on a type IV
(including none).

&gt;2) you were not likely to lose the washer on
&gt;the type IV and 3) that removing/repositioning the drive shaft on the type
&gt;IV is much easier than a type I.  He was right.  I was easily able to
&gt;remove the drive shaft and the spacer remained in position at the bottom of
&gt;the hole.

I'm glad it worked out for you, but I still think it was risky.

&gt;Simply remove the pin holding the drive dog to the distributor shaft and
&gt;drill a new hole in the shaft at 90 degrees + however many degrees 1/2
&gt;tooth is.  Sound reasonable??  Has anyone done this before?  Can anyone
&gt;think of any reason why I shoudn't do this?

I don't see how this could be necessary.  Your distributor must have an
extremely limited range of adjustment.  Are they all that way or is
something preventing yours from turning farther?  I can't believe that a 1
tooth change is too coarse.  Any chance you really moved it more than one
tooth?
