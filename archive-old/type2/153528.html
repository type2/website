Subject: Re: [T2] Small cracks in heads

Peter said:


Here's my bigger question: after inspecting the heads, we noticed some small cracks in and around the exhaust
ports near the valve stem seats on both heads. They look to me like casting cracks, so I was wondering how
common it is to find small cracks in the heads and will this be a problem, or do I need to replace them?
Thanks.

Dear Mel,

You've got things a bit backwards there.

The crack itself, which is quite common on dual-port heads, has no
particular characteristic with regard to engine sound or performance.
It's what comes next that gets your attention.  :-)

The cracks typically form between the valve seats, and from the valve
seats to the spark plug hole.  Once a crack appears, it ALWAYS gets
progressively worse; cracks do no 'heal' themselves.

The 'what-comes-next' is the exhaust valve seat, which comes loose from
the head.  This generates all sorts of unique noises that an
experienced VW mechanic can recognize from a block away.  Most describe
it as a 'tinny rattle' or variations on that theme but no two people
will perceive it exactly the same.

Mechanically, a loose valve seat will usually cause the valve's lash to
CLOSE and in doing so, offer a significant warning well before the
grand finale.  Normally, valve lash becomes wider in use.  The only
times it becomes LESS is when the valve begins to stretch or a loose
valve seat is be being hammered into the head, either of which is
portent of pending disaster, well worth the effort to drop the engine
and sort things out.

Most don't, of course.  Most continue to drive the poor thing until
they've converted the relatively minor repair into a major disaster
requiring the engine be overhauled or replaced.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

So why do heads cracks?

There isn't one sole reason but a combination of things.  Bad design is
a major player.  When VW went to the dual-port design it had to make
the casting thinner in several areas to gain room for the second port.


Metallurgy is a significant factor.  Aluminum is what's known as a
'white short' metal, a term from the casting industry that describes
metals which become frangible when heated.  Heat cast aluminum to its
frangible range and it breaks apart like a cube of sugar.  The
frangible range for cast aluminum depends upon the particular alloy but
for VW heads it begins at about 450 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale and
extends up to about 1200 degrees, where the metal begins to melt.

If you want to crack a VW head simply heat it to within the frangible
range then subject it to shock or stress.  The manner in which the
valves snap closed is enough shock to initiate cracking in an
overheated head, which is why most cracks begin between the valve
seats.  But detonation will also do it and since detonation is an
artifact of overheating, it's possible to trash an engine quick like a
bunny just by losing the fan belt or keeping your foot in it too deeply
on a hot day.  The stress produced by uneven torque on the head-stays
is another common cause of cracked heads.

How the vehicle is driven and maintained generates a whole file full of
good reasons for VW heads to crack but tearing out the thermostat tops
the list, followed by a loose fan belt, missing tin-ware -- especially
those 'unimportant' pieces the experts tell the kiddies they don't need
:-)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you prevent head cracks?

With dual-port heads, you can't.  The design is inherently flawed.
Given enough time, cracks WILL form between the valve seats and once
the crack has started, it will continue to get worse.

Proper maintenance of the engine, especially with regard to its cooling
system, will stave off the on-set of cracking but even the most cursory
read of VW magazines or groups such as this makes it clear that
disinformation is the order of the day, with bad advice out-weighing
the good by a wide margin.  A nice example of this is the popularity of
pulleys smaller than stock diameter, guaranteeing the engine will run
hot.

Operating the vehicle in a conservative fashion with careful attention
to the ambient temperature is another critical factor that is largely
ignored.  Having nothing to freeze, air cooled engines do best in cold
climates rather than hot but the fact Berlin is as far north as
Winnipeg escapes the notice of VW owners in Florida, southern
California and Texas (Brownsville is farther south than Cairo... but
don't tell anyone :-)

After-market heads having greater thickness in the areas most prone to
cracking offer some relief but only at the cost of poorer cooling,
since the thicker  casting can only be achieved by reducing the depth
of the cooling fins.  Reducing their depth reduces their area which
guarantees the heads will run hotter.  Enormously popular, of course
:-)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

So what to do?

If you aren't willing to become a pretty good VW mechanic, the wiser
option is to buy a Toyota and get on with your life, because sure as
babies shit green, if you are forced to rely upon someone else to do
your maintenance and repairs, you're gonna get screwed.

But having said that, the basic cure for a cracked head is to replace
it.  (I've described how to repair a cracked head in an article
posted... somewhere... some years ago.  Bottom line is that if you
aren't a pretty good TIG weldor with a shop full of tools and a life
full of experience, forget it.)  You need to make sure your replacement
head is IDENTICAL to the original otherwise you'll upset your
compression ratio and valve train geometry.  But when an identical head
is on-hand, the task is a simple R &amp; R chore -- remove &amp; replace.

There are a few details that must be taken into account, such as the
fact it's always best to replace both heads rather than one at a time,
or understand the need to slack off the stays on the good head so that
both will see equal tension once you've finished torquing-up.  Plus the
VITAL need to drop the engine and re-torque the heads after about six
hours of run-time, this to accommodate the malleable nature of cast
aluminum and its need to conform to the cylinder's sealing surface.
But on the whole, swapping heads is a relatively simple task.

Yeah, I know -- I could hear that from here :-)  So lemme restate
that...

Swapping heads is a relatively simple task when you understand the need
and reason for doing so.  In fact, in the proper management of your
vehicle's maintenance you won't even wait for the head to crack, you
will keep a spare pair of heads on-hand and REPLACE them as a matter of
course every time you do the clutch... when you will also re-set the
end-float, replace the main oil seal and so forth.  That event will
take thirty to forty thousand miles of driving, depending upon your
locale.  Yes, the clutch still works but here again, you are performing
PREVENTATIVE maintenance -- scheduling your time in order to deal with
problems BEFORE they occur.  When you plan your maintenance in this
fashion you will see there are logical sets of tasks that may be
performed at the same time, such as swapping-out those crack-prone DP
heads for a spare set.  Now you have several years of trouble-free
driving during which you can overhaul the old heads or obtain
replacements.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To return to your original question, the most characteristic sound of a
cracked head is the jingle of a cash register :-)
