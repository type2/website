&gt; This afternoon I pulled the exhaust system and heat exchangers.  There is a
&gt; leak inside one of the exchangers.  How practical is it to pry open the
&gt; exchanger, patch the hole, and close it back up?


If the leak is near either end of the heat exchanger,
you can either weld or braze a cover on it. (I dont like
the adhesives)

But, welding or brazing on a very dirty part, or if
the leak is where the aluminum fins are, is
next to impossible.

What I do is drill out the hole (if not too big) and 
thread in either a stove bolt or self tapping
metal screw. Slather with JB Weld or other high
temp epoxy, and it will never give you any more 
trouble. Much easier than trying to get the surface 
clean enough and hot enough to braze.

Note to self: Figure out how to manufacture new
shells for the heat exhangers, start 'rebuilding'
process, make fortune....
