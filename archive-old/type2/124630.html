Hi Nik,

I had the same problem and the welder determined that although the original
tray was badly rusted in the center there was enough good metal around the
edges to support the weight. He cut out the bad metal in the center which
left 1 to 2 inches around all the edges. He then fabricated a tray out of
fairly heavy guage metal to fit over the old tray with walls that bent up
about an inch. The tray is as large as possible so as to cover as much of
the remaining original metal as possible. I don't know if he found any
places to spot weld the new tray to or if it is just sitting there but it
didn't move. I then filled the gaps around the edges with some kind of
exterior caulk or weatherproof filler from a body shop. Finally, I painted
some kind of 'undercoat' around the bottom of everything. If I had it to do
again, I might POR15 the remaining metal after the bad metal was cut away.
This won't win any points toward 'Best Of Show' but I have had this setup
for about 15 years and it's still in good shape.

Good Luck,
