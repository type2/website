Subject: RE: [T2]how many miles on a tank of gas

I have 73 and I believe it has a 1700 in it.  I bought a Weber Progressive
and got the same results, about 150 miles to the tank.  What I found out is
that the jets in it are WAY to big for the engine.  I'm going to be getting
some smaller jets for it soon and Ill try to keep you updated to how it goes
and what I end up using.  I'm at about 5000 feet in the high desert of Utah
which will play a factor.  I know I could have it done at a shop and that
using the stuff that tests emissions and what not can help you get to the
right size quicker.  I like to do things myself so ill try a bunch of diff
ones till I find something I like.  I personally want to get good mileage
and im not as worried about power.

Hopefully that helps.
