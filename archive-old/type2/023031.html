I want to throw my iron in the fire one more time as well.

I'm not going to disagree with Karl or T.P Stephens or Bentley.  I'm not 
trying to say anyone is right or wrong.  I'm only relating my experience at 
face value, and here it is:

1)  I've been putting *small amounts* anti-seize on my Bosch plugs for 
100,000+ miles of bus driving over about the last 10 years.

2)  I haven't seen any symptoms of plug overheating.

3)  I haven't had a spark plug seize in the head** - they have always come 
loose easily and the threads have never been damaged.

4)  I haven't had problems with the anti-seize clogging up the threads.  It 
does seem to thicken with time because of the heat but I have always been 
able to remove it by wiping the plug threads with a clean cotton towel.  I 
use the Permatex brand in the silver tube.

5)  I am paranoid about spark plug thread problems so I'm going to stick 
with what works for me.  YMMV.

** Actually I did have it happen once but it was due to the poor quality 
rebuilt GEX head that I purchased many years ago.  When I got the heads 
home I found that one of the plugs would not thread into the head (among 
other things).  Close examination of the head revealed that the threads 
were buggered.  I went and bought a thread chaser and ran it in from the 
top a few times.  Unfortunately, the chaser only extended about half way 
through the threads before it bottomed out, and I couldn't find another 
chaser that would do better.  So, I threaded that plug in (by hand the 
first half of the way, then by wrench) after coating with anti-seize.  I 
removed it once about a year later and it came out but was still very 
tight.  When I removed the heads after 50k miles in favor of some MSHP 
rebuilds, I tried to remove the plug again and it seized, as in started to 
loosen for about one turn then got extraordinarily tight.  :)  But it was 
the fault of the mangled threads in the GEX head, not the anti-seize.

&gt;Well it's Friday so I guess a little controversy with Karl is in order...
&gt;  If anit-seize compound is so bad (changes the heat dissipation of the 
&gt; spark plug leading to overheating of same) why does the Good Book 
&gt; (Bentley) spend two paragraphs telling us of the importance of using it, 
&gt; and of not installing a dry plug in the head? Is there another compound 
&gt; Karl would recommend? If not, I'd rather lose a plug or two then my threads.
&gt;With all due respect for Karl,
