&gt; &gt;&gt;The type 4 engine is a well designed beast, however it was originally
&gt; &gt;&gt;designed for a 411&amp; 914, both of which are hard to kill in stock foem, 
&gt; &gt;&gt;and both of which have problems ever getting the oil hot enough to rid
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Hmmm... the last 914 I saw at the track, after a 20 minute session the 
&gt; &gt;temp gauge was pegged and the sweat falling from my face as I leaned 

&gt; aerodynamic, and geared a lot better, but they're in need of external oil 
&gt; coolers every bit as much as a bus.  Can't speak to the 411's since I've never 
&gt; had one.

my wife owned an almost new 1974  412 squareback (station wagen) and put
close to 100k on it before it was clobbered by a drunk while PARKED !

only time it ever got hot that I noticed was when the cold start valve
failed and it caught fire....fortunately had a fire ext and it was quickly
put back on the road

that was IMO one of the best family cars off the showroom floor ever
built.
