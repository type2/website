Subject: Wiring from hell, need help soon!

Hi all!
November hasn't been my month. I just came back home
and berly made it. I need some help ASAP. I was just
driving down the road an my head lights start dimming
a little (the only electrical equipment on at the
moment)I notice that my oil light start to go off but
not quiet. I did not paid much attention because some
body before me has wired up under the dash board and
did not know what the hell they were doing. So I
assume that was a grounding wire or something. Because
if where to be oil press is either the light on or
off, not between(I also have a gauge in the engine).
But actually I think is my voltage regulator or could
be my Gen. but I don't have a working Gen. light. I
been noticing that some times I started and my batt.
was dead, I figure since winter is coming a new batt.
won't hurt so I bought one few weeks ago. But today I
was bearly feeding out of the Gen. I have to turn my
lights off in the middle of the rush hour (total
darkness)until I pick up some good speed and the oil
light turn off. Then surprise my Gen. was back and I
have some electrical power back but no luck in
charging my batt. I came back home and was death. If
some body has experienced this problem or may know
what to do please let me know. As right now I may have
to rent-a-car because my primary transportation (a 97
Golf Jazz) was almost totaled when a Deer decided to
cross the road when I was doing almost 70 MPH, hitting
it then braking. What a hit! Any way sorry for the
long story but I hope some body can help me. Thanks in
advanced!
