Take a look at the wires running to and fro in the engine compartment.
Sometimes these wires will look good at the crimp connections, but can 
often act as intermittent nightmares.

Wire them all again, and this time, instead of crimping the connectors 
to the wires, solder them.
So as to eliminate vibration breakage of the wires, be sure to always 
use stranded wire.

After making the solder connections, make sure the wires protrude 
straight away from the connector, as opposed to any abrupt bending, 
ensuring that the gradually bend in the desired direction necessary for 
proper routing.

For any connections that you might wish to protect with additional 
insulation, use liquid tape of several applications, as opposed to 
normally used black electrician's tape.
