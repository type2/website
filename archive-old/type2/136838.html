&gt;does anyone have a tight throttle spring for a 2.0L FI bus? mine was 
&gt;stretched out. tried replacing it with a FLAPS one to no avail. all i can 
&gt;find are those &quot;HELP&quot; brand ones. one is too tight, the others are too 
&gt;loose. my bus is idling way too high and i cant get it to settle down.

If you mean the long spring that connects the throttle to the end of the plenum I picked up one at the junkyard last weekend for just such a person in need.

Send me your address and I'll mail it out to you.
