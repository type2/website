Subject: Re: [T2] Replacement Engine Fan?

&gt;Another quick question. I'm trying to go through the entire car and
&gt;I noticed that the cooling fan on my motor is missing three teeth. From what
&gt;I understand.. the previous owner had the engine rebuilt, but used the older
&gt;parts.. so these teeth probably came off a long time ago before this new
&gt;motor was installed.
&gt;
&gt;I was wondering if maybe there was some sort of aftermarket &quot;performance&quot;
&gt;fan that I could install in place of that.. maybe one that was slightly
&gt;better designed the allowed more air to flow? Any idea?

I've got two spares missing 1 tooth if you want them. Free for the cost of 
shipping.

Let me know soon as they will be going to the dump Friday to be recycled.
