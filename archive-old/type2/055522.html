Subject: &quot;Sightings&quot; - A STAR is/was born.................

One of our local cable TV channels specializes in broadcasting primarily 
&quot;golden oldies&quot; TV series, one of which is the original B&amp;W Hitchcock program.

Last night (2-19-98) the episode was a story centered on a man traveling 
across the country to California in a split-window Kombi.

The lead character was played by MacDonald Carey, but the *STAR* was a 
then-new Kombi.  The Kombi was on screen throughout the episode, including 
plenty of interior shots.  

In one scene there was a flat tire in the middle of the desert, and Carey went 
through a sequence where he showed his hitchhiker passengers where the spare, 
etc., was stored under the front bench seat and how to actually change the 
tire. 

I'm not an expert on splittie model year distinguishing characteristics, so 
can't say for sure what year Kombi was shown/used, but my guess is early to 
mid '60s.  I also tried to catch an episode identification of some kind, but 
failed to see anything.  I missed the first few minutes of the broadcast, so 
didn't get the episode title.

I'll admit I was surprised to see the Kombi be the focus of the program, 
especially since it was clearly dead stock rather than being &quot;enhanced&quot; for 
dramatic purposes.

Special Note to Clara:  the broadcast was on &quot;KONG&quot;, KING-TV's (Seattle) 
sister cable channel.
