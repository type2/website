Subject: Re: ?What year belly pans?

&gt;&gt; What year did VW start doing this? was this a loaf-only mod? I don't 
&gt;&gt;think the '67 westy I'm getting has belly pans.
&gt;
&gt;Its a split-window-only mod.  I imagine they started in '51 with 
&gt;the first deluxes and sunroofs.

Some post '67 buses had belly pans.  My '70 Dormobile had full belly 
pans.  A couple of '68 or '69 Westfalias I have owned had pans over 
the outriggers, but not the center section.

As far as splitties, both my double door buses have full belly pans.  
All three of my 21-window buses have full belly pans.  Of the 4 '66 
Westys I have owned (with the small pop-top) only one had belly pans, 
and it was only over the outriggers.
