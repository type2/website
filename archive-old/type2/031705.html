&gt; Correction...Make that &quot;Bob's&quot; fix...sorry Bob.

&gt; &quot;the cure is to swage the valve seats after instalation

not my fix, Bruce who rebuilt my head's was an old VW machinist and he
said it was something he was taught by VW and the tool he uses was a VW
tool, sorry didn't get the tool number

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;. The diesel
&gt; seats and David's idea are a good approach.  However, even if you keep the
&gt; seats in thru brute force that doesn't address the cause which is our
&gt; common, old enemy...too much heat.

yup, still gotta keep the heat down, just solves one result not the
underlying problem, 

I think (and many others have said) that a well functioning cooling system
will keep a stock engine cool in almost any condition.
  remember these buses were originally built for the masses and not us
