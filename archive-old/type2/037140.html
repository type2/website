Subject: Re: Gear Shifter Stuck &quot;Down&quot; ?

Your gearshift goes into a little ball that fits in to a cup like thing that
is on the linkage and when the mechanic was looking for reverse he went to
far to the right and popped the ball out of the cup.  When you pulled up on
the shifter you got it to fall back into the cup

&gt; The petroleum engineer had to back Itch up to check the front end.
&gt; Apparently gets into reverse, but the tranny locks the rear wheels cold,
and
&gt; then the gear shift won't go into or out of any &quot;gear&quot;, unless I unload
&gt; pressure on the rear wheels. The shift pattern is unrecognizable. What
feels
&gt; like neutral is some forward gear (I hit the starter with the clutch out,
&gt; and it felt like it was in third gear).
&gt;
&gt; Life turns into hell.
&gt;
&gt; After 15 minutes of fiddling, I made some gear changes pulling up on the
&gt; shifter, and something must have gone right, 'cuz at some point, Itch
&gt; shifted as if nothing ever happened. Drove him this W/E without problems,
&gt; and to work today w/o problems. It's just as if nothing happened.
&gt;
&gt; What happened?
