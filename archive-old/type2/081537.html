Subject: Re: [T2] Curtains

When I got my 72 Westy somebody had put the thin metal rod along the actual
door and not contoured to the sliding door track (I think they used one from
a rear hatch, because there is no sign of bending). This worked just find
and it would keep anyone from pulling on that bar, especially when the
sliding door is open. However that means you couldn't use your curtains when
the door was open. The curtain retainer strap was also mounted on the door.

 I have since acquired the contoured curtain rod and installed it with
screws. This &quot;rod&quot; utilizes little sliders that you sew into the curtain
fabric. GoWesty sells them:

And you should have a strap under where your seat belt hangs to retain it.
The original curtains had a little ring sewn into the corner and this ring
went on the hook on your cabinet door you always wondered about. :)

At the bottom of this page I added some pics of the sliding door curtain,
the rod and the hook:

Hope this helps!

&gt; The correct curtain rods are made out of alumininum, and are about 1/16&quot;
&gt; thick,x 1/8th wide, and are attatched by two tiny sheet metal screws on
&gt; each end.
&gt;
&gt; The sliding door rod follows the contour of the inner track from behnd
&gt; the passenger seat to the post behind the door.
&gt; They are flimsey, so don't let your passenger's swing on them when
&gt; entering or riding in the rear of your Westy---

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; So I'm making curtains for the '72 Westy, but I can't figure out the
&gt; sliding door curtain. What was the original setup? Where was the curtain
&gt; rod and how/where was it attached? And...
&gt; Does anyone out there have some good pics of their sliding door
&gt; curtains? I'm not a purist, so they don't have to be original VW design,
&gt; I just want to get an idea of what others are doing.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; -PM
