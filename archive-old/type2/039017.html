Subject: Re: Camping list, was &quot;Going Cross Country!!!&quot;

&gt;Okay, Rick, I gotta admit, that was a great list. But just lemme ask you
&gt;this....
&gt;PANTY HOSE??? What kinda camping are we talking about here?? I've driven my
&gt;bus all over the country in the last twelve years, without a single pair of
&gt;panty hose.
&gt;What am I missing??

You must have read closely, I'll give you an &quot;A&quot; for that!

I must have forgotten to take that one off for this list.  I have been
building tube frame dune buggies since the 70's.  For a while, we were even
making them in the welding shop!  Great project for the students.  We had a
bender, so we could design, bend, weld, wire, paint and build our own
engines.

Back to the panty hose, they work great to cover the air cleaner and even
the entire carb to keep the sand out of the filter and off the linkage.

Some of the buggy people such as the late Josh Rogers even used his '71
standard bus to pull his buggy to the dunes and then camp in the bus.
