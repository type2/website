Subject: Re: [T2] Start Problem

Hello all,

It was the power relay in the dual relay as it turned out.   After 
examining that l-tronic electrical diagram I ran a wire from the coil 
direct to terminal 88b of the relay.  After that moving the afm flapper 
valve activated the fuel pump and I knew I'd won.  The engine started 
right up.  Yeehaw!  I've got a new relay on the way but I don't see any 
obvious concerns with running like that if I have to.  At least I can 
get it out of my garage if I want.

Unfortunately I seem to have a dead cylinder.  I'm not sure how long its 
been like that, it could have been a while (shameful, I know).  When I 
pull the lead off the number four spark plug there is no change in 
engine speed/ sound.  The lead is arcing well.  Since I'd just done the 
pushrod tube seals I decided to check the lash on the valves, I'd not 
touched them previously when I put the rocker arms back on.  I think I 
got it right, two turns?  Made no difference.  I borrowed a compresion 
checker, that dead number four is the best cylinder at 125 psi.  The 
others came in at 107psi, 118psi and 115psi.  Yikes, how bad is that!  
The Haines manual doesn't seem to say what new engine compression should 
be or what the recommended minimum is before an overhaul is nessesary 
but last time the compression was checked (eleven years ago!!) they were 
145-145-145-160 so they've all come down al lot since then.  There is 
200,000 km on that engine.  Poor girl has a hard life in our arctic 
climate, I'm sure I push it too far with the cold sometimes.

Anyway, I guess I'll check the fuel injector and maybe have someone turn 
the starter while I look at the valves to see if they look like they are 
moving normally.  I seem to have solved one problem and discovered 
another more serious.  Something tells me I'm in for a rebuild which 
would be waaaaaay over my head.  I've only just recently got the Haines 
manual and everything I've been doing is as a complete newbie.

So any suggestions about my dead cylinder would be appreciated and how 
bad is that compression?

107psi - 118psi - 115psi - 125psi  on a 2.0 litre, aircooled.

Thank you.

I believe the coil energizes from the other relay in
the double relay. Did you keep everything else the
same, just swap the power lead at the pump under the
bus?
