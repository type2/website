Subject: re: Help me split the case!!!

Ron:

That was exactly the problem.  Found that I had missed one on the lower 
front just outside of the bellhousing.  Once that one was out, the case 
came apart easily.  I posted an amended &quot;Help me split the case&quot; message 
detailing the location of *all* of the fasteners.

Thanks!

&gt; (FIF) behind the flywheel.  Clean it all up and roll that sucker over and
&gt; over until you are sure you them all.  Then do it once more.  It supposedly
&gt; should come apart with a few raps of a rubber hammer or a steel hammer on a
&gt; piece of wood.  I guess this depends on what kind of case sealant was used.
&gt; If it was glue than I guess it might be harder.
