Subject: Re:  torsion


Matty,

It's kind of a rough job to reset your torsion.  You probably don't need to
buy new ones (unless they come out rusty), just reset your old ones.  You DO
need spring plate bushings there are four of them at about $6.00 each.  You
may want to do all the rear brakes while you are in there.  Make sure you
follow the procedure in the Bentley book exactly.  It explains everything.
George Lyle wrote a good description in the archives a few months ago.

a few things to remember:

mark with a cold chisel or paint pen where the bearing assemblies match up
to the spring plate top and bottom because the bolt holes are oval to allow
for alignment adjustment.  You probably want to put it back how it is, and
you need to make these marks.

Make sure your bus frame is level I mean LEVEL! You can measure the angle of
the unloaded spring plate with a 99 cent protractor with a thread hanging
from the center hole and a small weight like a nut.  Works much better than
the $5.00 craftsman bubble inclinometer--0.5 degree precision instead of ~3
degrees.

Remember to measure the unloaded spring plates before you remove the spring
plate.  You want to make sure how much of a change you are making before you
put it back together.  So you need to know where you started from.

The big bearing assembly bolts are 22 mm they are very tight so you need at
least a wrench and socket with flex bar and some yankee ingenuity and lots
of liquid wrench.

Good luck!
