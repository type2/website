All bulbs were flashing. Well that was odd.

Turned out to be the little black box thingy under the fuse box (hope that
is not too technical) was full of water.

First of all I want to thank Roy at Mofoco for selling me the one he had in
his toolbox.

So I get figure out where the water came from. I figure window seal or washer.

But nonetheless water in my fuse box can not be good.



Enjoy and thanks for the info
Jerry

&gt;Hey All,
&gt;	This should be an easy one. Last night our '78 bus's turn signals
&gt;went belly-up. They are blinking real fast. My first concern is that they
&gt;are having a flash back to the days of disco. Maybe a bad bulb or fuse?
&gt;
&gt;Any one want to take a crack at this.
&gt;Perhaps I can pickup the parts on the way home.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
