Well, same here to some extant.

I had a clerk old guy there get snotty with me too. And I had a trailer
hitch installed and wired wrong there also. But as a place where you can
shop off the shelf for aftermarket items like curtain rollers and
practically every other imaginable RV and camper need they are a great
resource.

I have also had clerks there that went out of their way to answer all my
questions and be gratious and helpful. And I've never had a problem with
catalogue sales.

I doubt that they pay alot for wages, so it's no wonder to me why the
have some people there that shouldn't be working with the public. But
you can't go anywhere anymore and get good service everytime ALL the
time. 

It's a bad state of affairs when you can't spend your money without alot
of hassel and sometimes it seems like the hassel is getting so much
worse every day. However, I decided not to live life mad at the world
and so I try to let go of the little things that aren't going my way and
accomplish what I started out to do. 

No need to win every conflict anymore.

&gt; With the exception of an installer I worked with, I've found Camping World
&gt; to be uniformly snotty and their customer service to be just about the
&gt; bottom of the barrel. I'd highly recommend using independent RV places for
&gt; camper needs. Or West Marine for &quot;RV&quot; supplies/parts cheaper than Camping
&gt; World. Maybe I've just had bad experiences, but I do not regard them well at
&gt; all!
