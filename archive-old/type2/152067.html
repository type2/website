&gt; This is a good setup for a few. We have one person locally that has claimed

yeah this seems a solution for someone who owns a fast food joint.

some years ago I started converting a 71 bus into a 100% electric vehicle
but the battery cost killed the project,  that and the weight and
range..projected to be only about 50 miles...
