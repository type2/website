Subject: Tent Canvas Question

Someone emailed me a question about westy tent canvas: any ideas?  I heard
there is a westy tent expert out there somewhere...

THanks!

&gt;I am in need of the canvas for the tent on 
&gt;this 57 camper.  I have the assembly poles, but no canvas.  It is 
&gt;supposed to have a small zippered room for the port-o-potty that comes 
&gt;with the bus.  Any suggestion will be appreciated.
