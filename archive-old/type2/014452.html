Hey all,
Let me say one thing more about, metal preparation, sealing, priming,
and refinishing any vehicle.

My profession is collision /refinishing Semi-Tractors, and have been
doing it for 26 years.
It is my business.
I have never had a come-back because of poor paint preparation, or a
poor paint job.


I have been using Metal prep from Dupont, to remove any oxidation, rust,
contaminants, with excellent results.

I have been using Vari-Prime to etch into the metal, and seal old
unknown prior top coats, with excellent results.

I have been using Ultra Fill, by Sherwin Williams, to fill any
imperfections, with minimum shrinkage,and zero paint bleed through.

I have used Dupont's Paints and they are not as durable as PPG's
products, and take longer to set up, and there flow characteristics are
terrible.

Yes I do use many different manufacturers products but it has been
through many years of trial and error, that I can share these
conclusions.

Now, I want to say this about Vari-Prime,zinc chromate primer.
All US aircraft, since they have been skinned with aluminum, have been
acid washed, primed and painted with zinc chromate.
The acid etch primer is essential on aluminum, to cause any paint to
stick at all.
Without it it would soon flake off.

Next ime you look at a aircraft check out the inner panels.

And refinishing any oxidized metals puts you in the same category, the
metal must be super clean, sealed with some sort of acid etch primer,
filled with a high fill primer, then refinished.

POR products are nothing more than a polyisosyinate, sealer, with
absolutely zero galvanic properties, and zero etching properties.

It is for the hobbyist, who wants a quick fix, while repairing spot rust
in his driveway, a cave and pave type thing, and down the road.

It won't seal aluminum, it won't seal stainless, it won't seal steel.
That`s just the way it is.

It is a &quot;miracle in a can&quot; type product, similar to Slick 50, Prolong,
or any other infomercial type product.

I like doing the job correct the first time, and not have it come back
to bite me later.

I hate doing things twice, because of a quick fix, wiz-bang product, and
I have found the refinishing materials that I have been using to be
among the finest.

This is my professional opinion.

Later,

  ______________
