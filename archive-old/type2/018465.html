&gt; That is I have a gas leak, it seems . I first noticed what looked like a
&gt; water spot but obviously a gas stain on my intake manifold.  When I inspected
&gt; my carb.there was gas seepage on it . The seepage was mostly around the
&gt; middle of the carb. None along the top and none that I could notice around
&gt; the bottom. My carb is a Solex H30-31Pict made in Brazil. 

When the engine is running can you see it leaking?  I had a 34 PICT 3
that was leaking at the bushing where the shaft for the throttle plate
runs through the body of the carb.  I once read that there was a
temporary fix for this but the real fix is to have a machine shop
(preferably one that has done this kind of thing before) drill it out
and install a new bushing.  The only place that I KNOW can do this kind
of thing is Rimco Machine in Santa Ana, CA.  I've never used them but
I've only heard good things about their work.

I guess my point is this - if it is leaking at the bushing like mine was
rebuilding it is not going to work.  As far as I know any other normal
leak would be a gasket.

Hope this helps.
