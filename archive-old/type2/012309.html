Subject: NEED web editing help (yeah bus content)
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, as I rebuilt the 2.0 for the '82 I decided to take about 400 or so
digital pics with the intention of doing a www based rebuild article
for the T4 only to throw up on type2.  Basically to supplement Wilson
with T4 only tips and pics of assembly without confusing T1 stuff thrown
in.  Plus Wilson does err often enough in some of his T4 info now and
then.

Thing is, I've sort of become a computer dinosaur, and have no real
interest in learning how to actually make the pages (ok to do the work
as I don't really have the time, med school is somewhat of a drag.)
So what I'm looking for is a gullible fool to share the credit and profits
(that is a joke, the info will be totally free of course.)  Basically I'd
supply
the pics and text files, I need somebody to put it together and make it look
good.  Your only real reward would be the credit thingy I guess.

If anyone is so stupid, please get in touch with me.
