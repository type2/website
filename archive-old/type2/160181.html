Subject: Re: [T2] Bought correct rocker panels, but the bend is not what
  I expected.

I bought  the rocker panel for the drivers side of my 77 Westy, and the 
Danish  part

http://www.cip1_dot_ca/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=TAB%2D402%2D501

does  not have nearly as much curve as the body does. It's the one that is 6&quot; 
high.  If I clamp the bottom of it to the bottom of the Westy the top of the 
new  panel is bent out at least 4 inches. Is this just normal, and they expect 
me  to curve it around? I've never done this before so it's all new to me. I  
thought it would be pretty much identical to the bend the original section  
has.
Thanks,
Courtney
Its very normal that aftermarket sheet metal will need modifications to  make 
them fit. 
 
Start with a long pipe with a large diameter to curve the replacement  rocker 
panel.
 
You can make a template from your bus and with the pipe hand bend it in to  
shape.
 
good luck with it and lets hope the makers of aftermarket parts will  care  
more about making a better product.
