[...]  You might want to check out the PG&amp;E campgrounds
(http://www.pge_dot_com/009_about/009c2_rec_area.shtml).  I haven't been to any
of them myself but I here that most of their spots are real a back woods
kind of campgrounds.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;   What I want to do is go camping, not in a RV park but way out some dirt
&gt; road in the mountains where I can see some of mother natures beauty. I'm
&gt; looking for an area which doesn't impose on anyone's private property (
&gt; but
&gt; if you know of someone who wouldn't mind ) near Lake Shasta, Calif, or
&gt; southern Oregon. Katelyn (11) and I would like to take the Roadcow out and
&gt; spend some quality time together and enjoy the outdoors. I told her I'd
&gt; re-teach her how to fish and with the Westy we both can cook. We are open
&gt; to
&gt; and encourage anyone to join us on this fun low stress campout. Please
&gt; feel
&gt; free to send comments and suggestions. Hope to see many listees at the
&gt; Classic!
&gt;
