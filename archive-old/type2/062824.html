&gt; Most older steel wheels are not perfectly true.  If want to go that

&gt; wheels to an acceptable tolerance.  8-)  14&quot; bus wheels are fairly common.
&gt; If you have some extras, try them for trueness while bolted to a drum.
&gt; Use a 'bad' one for a spare if you're short on rims.

I'm glad you are kidding about the sledge hammer. If it's moving at top 
and bottom, I'd check the king pins, or equivilent. If moving left and 
right, I'd check the steering linkages.

A good alignment shop will be GLAD to point out the worn mechanisms.
