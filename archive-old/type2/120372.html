Subject: voltage regulator toasted

When I shut off the key tonight, the GEN light stayed on. This after
pulling the key. After engaging and re-engaging the ignition mechanism,
I concluded it was not a short or anything there. Recollecting the
first couple of pages of &quot;gen light on&quot; from Muir, I disconnected the
battery. Bentley had the same diagnosis, but indicated that the
alternator was first added to the bus in the 1972 model, not 1973 as
Muir said. I'll be editing that in my idiot book.
Ok... on to the questions:
Not to start a FART, but where should I pursue a replacement? Can the
typical National FLAP supply this? There's always ordering from
BusDepot, but they have 2 listed for 1972 without any accompanying
documentation (&quot;suppressed&quot; for $41.70 and &quot;for standard and high
output alternators&quot; for $26.95). All things remaining equal, my wallet
likes $26.95 out of the gate, but will my bus like it a year from now?
Has anyone had experience with any of these solutions and offer a
recommendation? pmail is fine, if there is Annoying Thread fear.
TIA
