Here's my two cents,
    I futzed with my crummy starter problems for months and =
months....then
it got cold and snow was on the ground when the shebang finally decided =
not
to coperate.  Ever try to push start a bus in the snow by yourself?  =
Well,
with a little engineering (if you can call it that) my bus sports a nice
little button under the dash.  Yes, before i installed the button, I had =
put
in two ignition switches(bosch), 2 starters (bosch again), rewired some
small segments and generally absolved myself to crawl under the bus and =
use
Muir's technique with the screwdriver and a wrench to bridge the =
solenoid.
Push button installed and we haven't had a starting problem since.  Why =
go
back to VW's system which constantly had me futzing with it in winter
conditions? Flame suit on and extinguisher poised for action.

&gt; Dear List Friends,
&gt;
&gt; After reading all the posts about how terrible it is to install a push
&gt; button for starting, and the resulting flames and anti-flames, I felt =
it
was
&gt; time for a response from yours truly.
&gt;
&gt; After making a silly mistake with some under-dash wires, I fried my
ignition
&gt; switch. Jiggling would get it to start but I couldn't find a place to =
make
&gt; it keep running. Long story short, I decided to install a push button
system
&gt; since I couldn't wait for a new stock switch to arrive by mail. First =
of
&gt; all, I didn't have to &quot;cut holes in my dashboard&quot; since there were two
&gt; factory holes covered only by the vinyl, though I did have to enlarge =
one
&gt; slightly with the dremel.  They appearance is professional looking;
factory
&gt; even. Only someone who KNOWS what a 74 T2 dash is supposed to look =
like
&gt; would notice that something was different.
&gt;
&gt; Second, this isn't some &quot;squeaky-cheep&quot; work around. We're not talking
romex
&gt; stuffed under the carpeting, here. I used quality switches, terminals, =
and
&gt; wire. I used a fused, two-position pull switch for power and a heavy =
duty
&gt; push button for starting; I soldered all connections (even the crimp
&gt; terminals), covered all joints with shrink-tube insulation. I used the
&gt; original wiring, only having to extend one or two to reach the push
button.
&gt; One advantage to this system is that I now have an &quot;Accessory&quot; =
position on
&gt; my ignition--something VW never saw fit to include. I also see it as
having
&gt; some minor anti-theft properties since it isn't a common system and =
nobody
&gt; can make it start from the key switch.
&gt;
&gt; Done correctly, I don't see why this is inferior to the factory =
system.
&gt; Rather than being jury-rigged, it is simply a differently engineered
system
&gt; which accomplishes the original builder's intent with reliability,
&gt; durability, and a bit of style (if I do say so myself). Did anyone =
here
put
&gt; in a new stock switch in June of this year? We can have a contest to =
see
&gt; whose lasts longer. Chances are we'll both be far beyond the age of =
reason
&gt; before either one of them fails.
&gt;
&gt; On a final note, I have to say that I understand and respect Dr. Tim's
&gt; opinion on these things based on his status as a professional. My =
system
may
&gt; give pause to the next professional  who works on it (doubtful that =
will
&gt; happen but never say never), but anyone competent enough to be a
&gt; professional could figure it out in five minutes with a multimeter and =
an
&gt; open mind. In many regards, &quot;stock ist best&quot;, especially in engine
&gt; components, however when it comes to ordinary things like switches =
there
is
&gt; nothing inherently superior in the VW system when compared to other
quality
&gt; systems that accomplish the same function.  (Remember we're talking =
daily
&gt; drivers, here, not pure restorations.)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;pontificating mode off&lt;

&gt; PS: Flame on if you want to; I can take it!
