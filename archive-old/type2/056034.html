hi folks,

I know this thread is a couple of days old, but this might be 
interesting for anyone looking for a better place to store their 
table.  I cut my table down about 2 inches on a table saw, rounded 
the corners, put a new kerf (a slot using  the table saw) in the 
edge, got some new trim plastic, and it looks as good as new.  (Make 
sure you put tape down on the Formica before cutting it--it keeps it 
from splintering.)  TheTrim Plastic can be found at Woodworkers 
warehouse if you are looking.  It now stores in the spare tire holder 
behind the drivers seat (my spare is on the front) and I stuff a 
towel in with it to keep it from knocking.

FWIW.  Hope it helps someone.
