&gt; Like Jamie, I placed an order and got the great discount, and prompt
&gt; service, and everything I ordered. With no problems. I got the terrific
&gt; jack, and the drink holders. Good stuff, good service.
&gt; And thanks to Ron for the great offer.

I placed an order (emergency order) Tue, got it noon Wed... heck I was in
such a rush forgot to get my list discount,  oh well got the part I
needed, in LESS than 24 hours!  (ok I did pay $16 for next day service)

when you absolutely positively have to get it today!

&gt; &gt; I also placed an order on Ron's triple discount day.  The order arrived
&gt; &gt; promptly.  I was missing three seals and immediately e-mailed Ron.  This
&gt; &gt; was on the 16th.  I received a call from Dan the next day to check up on
&gt; &gt; the order and to see how I was doing.  Well, I received the seals that I
&gt; &gt; was missing, today.  No complaints just praises of The Bus Depot.  Thanks
&gt; &gt; again Ron and crew for your service and the gracious offer that you gave
&gt; &gt; the list!
