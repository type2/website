&gt; If number 3 is firing but number 4 isn't, and
&gt; you are feeding both 
&gt; cylinders from a single carb, you can pretty
&gt; much rule out the carb as the 
&gt; cause of the problem.  You have also verified
&gt; compression.  The only thing 
&gt; left is spark.  You say you've swapped plug,
&gt; wire, and cap, which are the 
&gt; only cylinder-specific parts.  That essentially
&gt; rules out spark too.  So 
&gt; what is left?  Only some very improbable
&gt; things, like:
&gt; 
&gt; The new spark plug or cap was also bad
&gt; Plug is somehow being grounded when installed
&gt; A/F supply is marginal for firing, barely
&gt; enough for #3 but not for #4
&gt; Cap not fastened down properly
&gt; Valves opening at wrong time - broken cam?
&gt; You made a mistake somewhere
&gt; 
&gt; Here are some other wierd things you could try
&gt; which may give you a clue to 
&gt; the problem, in no particular order:
&gt; 
&gt; Turn your dizzy 90 degrees and rotate your plug
&gt; wires 90 degrees in the 
&gt; opposite direction.  Does #4 still not fire, or
&gt; 1 or 3 (depending on which 
&gt; way you turned)?
&gt; 
&gt; Remove plugs and attach the plug wires.  Ground
&gt; plugs against tin and turn 
&gt; over engine.  Is #4 spark plug sparking
&gt; properly?  Compare spark of #4 to 
&gt; other plugs.
&gt; 
&gt; *Carefully*  drip some gasoline down the left
&gt; carb throat while the engine 
&gt; is idling.  Does #4 begin firing?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;With the plug fouling, I suspect dumping that
&gt; &gt;oily breather blowby directly into the carb
&gt; port
&gt; &gt;may have fouled up the intake?  Any thoughts
&gt; on
&gt; &gt;dieseling the carb as per Muir?
&gt; 
&gt; I seriously doubt that had anything to do with
&gt; your problem.

Thanks, Dave.  I will try all your suggestions
this evening.  

I'm concerned about cam problems.  I'm going to
take the valve covers off and check for the
valves opening and closing properly.  

Already tried the diesel fuel thing.  Lotsa
smoke.  I mean LOTSA SMOKE, but no real change. 
However, I noticed that at high rpm (I adjusted
the carb up--big screw-- and also held the
throttle open most of the time to run the diesel
through) that removing #4's wire did make a
difference, though it was less perceptible than
the others.  

Verified dwell and timing today.  (Adjusted
timing a little.)  

I've double checked everything I could with
respect to plugs wires and plugs.  Switching
plugs and wires did not change the fact that #4
was dead.  I cannot reorient the dizzy because
the vac pot interferes if I try to make it face
the left.  

Thanks,
Ray
