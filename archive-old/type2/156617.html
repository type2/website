When did they pass the law requiring vehicle owners to track the ownership
of their vehicles from day one?  She's blowing smoke.

&gt; Do all of you
&gt; know how many owners your Bus had?

Yes, I'm the third, but only if I go on the verbal history provided by the
second owner.  If he decided to get creative I might well be the 6th.  I
really don't care.  Would your &quot;buyer&quot; have been happier if you lied and
told her that the previous owner was Jerry Garcia?  :)

&gt; She said that the
&gt; air-cooled engines dont last that long.

So what else is new?  They also fix and replace easily.  At this point you
should have directed her to the nearest Toyota dealer, as she obviously
isn't qualified to own an aircooled VW.

&gt; She asked how
&gt; many engines my Bus has had? I said I don't know, it
&gt; could be the original one. She said again, I should
&gt; know these things, I lost it at that point and told
&gt; her nobody would know these things unless you owned it
&gt; from day one. Am I nuts?

Nope.  Unless the car is something exotic, or the owner is particularly
anal, nobody keeps a logbook, which is what she is talking about.
