Subject: Re: [T2] Synthetic Oil: done to death?

That's an interesting article. Oil sampling is something that has been
on the back of my mind since we regularly had to submit oil samples
for testing on our military vehicles, especially the expensive heavy
ones like tank motors. Once and a while a customer will come in to
mail his oil sample and gets me to thinking about it, but I have never
followed through.

One point Castrol makes on oil life is that even though the oil stock
is good for 25K + miles, the combustion by-products contaminate the
oil and mandate synthetics be changed at the 3K mile interval anyway.
Maybe just a ploy to sell more oil? I don't know, so I compromise and
change my synthetics at 7,500 miles.
