Subject: Electrical anomaly

Labor Day greetings, Volks fellows,

My '74 Riviera got crochety and altered my holiday plans by refusing to run
after a few minutes. Had charged the battery and replaced it, cranked a few
times to get gas in the carb (it had been sitting idle for a while) then
started and ran but the idle was all over the place and I had to keep
goosing it when waiting for traffic lights. Not unusual since its PO had
installed a Weber Progressive and 009 dizzy.

But after running for 15 minutes and coming to another stop, the engine quit
and when I tried to start there was no electrical power at all. Turning the
key to start had no effect - the warning lights didn't even come on. Trying
to start by coasting downhill and letting out the clutch w/ key on didn't
work - again not even warning lights.

After sitting a bit power was surprisingly restored to operate headlights
but when I tried to start, after the starter engaged .5 second, no power
again. Battery has been load tested and has charge measuring 12.7 volts. All
connections, ground and hot, are bright clean. Has hot start relay, all
fuses everywhere are checked and good, the starter is a relatively new (not
refurbished) Bosch about 1500 miles old. Thanks if you have any ideas/cures.

-Will Holt
