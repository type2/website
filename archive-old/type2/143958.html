Subject: EGR thingy on an 1800 '74  motor?

Looking at some of the recent posts about somebodies
air cleaner woes prompts this question: underneath and
forward on the pass side on my motor is some sort of
rectangular can that is mostly rusted away but has the
remains of what looks like some kind of filter. From
the microfiche pictures on Ratwell and the info in the
posts I mentioned, it looks like this is part of the
EGR system. If so, mine is looking pretty ineffectual,
being rusted out like that. What purpose did this
filter serve and what kind of degraded performance am
I likely experiencing?

While I'm at it, I am experiencing an oil leak in the
area of #3 cyl. The oil appears to drip onto the
underneath cooling tin and is in such close proximity
to the exhaust manifold that it burns off and smokes
pretty good. I haven't had enough time to yank off the
tin for a closer inspection, but I would suspect
perhaps the tube one of the #3 valve lifters resides
in. Make sense? Is it fixable w/o removing the engine,
if this is indeed the source?
