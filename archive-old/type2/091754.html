Personally, I would go for the one with the quick release hose.  It's a pain to get the hose to thread into the spark plug holes thru the engine tin and it's much easier to &quot;wind&quot; the hose tight when no gauge is attached.

Having said this, the Mightvac brand compression gauge at most flaps is $30, less than the CP7827 and looks identical.
