Subject: [T2] Sorry,Tyres again.

I followed the tyre thread but have a question now after deviating from the
norm.
Michelin Classic, 185 R14 C, looking OK.
But 8 ply (1875 lbs) vs. 6 ply (1540 lbs) so appeared well specified.
But the legend on the tyres say1875 lbs _at_ 65 psi cold.
This is well away from the VW text of 30lbs front, 37lbs rear.
Do I use 65 psi and have a hard ride or guess at 50 psi and run these tyres
underinflated ?
I reckon these are light truck tyres and a further legend says North America
or Australia !
Any offers on which way to jump ?
