&gt;   Has anybody tried this? Good idea or just a pipe dream? It's not that
&gt;the factory gaskets are expensive or anything like that, it just seems
&gt;to me copper would hold up better in the long run.
&gt;   Comments?

i have in the past been pinched to find the proper copper washer of
suitable size for various projects and had to resort to my
collection of old engravings of Abraham Lincoln which with a minor
modification seemed to fit the bill...and cheaper than a trip to the store..
