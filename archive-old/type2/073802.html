Subject: Re: [T2] lessons on the aftermarket

WCM ''lifetime warranty'' ONLY applies to rubber and plastic parts manufactured
by WCM.

Every right side page in the #23 glove box edition starting on page 3 says
'lifetime guarantee' along the bottom. BUT read the bottom of page 1......THEN
read the 1st paragragh on the header page:
&lt;snip&gt;
we manufacture over 60% of all the parts we offer
&lt;snip&gt;
and a real lifetime guarantee (no fine print!) This guarantee on all parts
manufactured by us......

Hmmm.....every page says lifetime guarantee but you don't if they made it or not
until you order it and get it delivered.


&gt; Hey let's take it easy bashing the number one manufacturer and importer of
&gt; quality restoration products. First WCM West Coast Metrics offers a lifetime
&gt; guarantee for there product to last a lifetime and to fit perfectly. So how
&gt; can you complain about the LAME fit. Just send it back for a new one. The
&gt; problem is not that you bought a WCM product. You bought an auction site
&gt; product. WCM parts cost more because they are a quality guaranteed product.
&gt; Not all OEM German product runs are perfect either. poop happens. Don't take
&gt; a chance, buy a product with a guarantee. Call WCM and tell them what
&gt; happened. I'm willing to bet that they will help you out. If not I'll go bat
&gt; for you. WCM products are the best available period. I'll at least give you
&gt; nine bucks trade in for it.
