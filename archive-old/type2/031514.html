&gt; My question regards to the wiring at the double relay.  I plan on swapping
&gt; the FI and components, and since my van was carbureted, my fuel pump is not
&gt; wired from the double relay.

need the special high presure fuel pump too,  cannot use the same pump as
a carb model bus.   not sure the presure on carb but it is about 4psi
while the FI pump is about 35psi
