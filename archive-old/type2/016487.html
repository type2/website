Subject: Cool Air

Hello,
    A listee mentioned A/C available from 972-771-3791.

    I called the number and, sure enough, an after market A/C unit can be
purchased from Jerry West.
    Jerry described the product as based on VW of America quality and
specifications. It is a dual unit with both under dash and passenger compartment
air supplies. Total cooling is 36,000 BTUs and engine HP used is 1.5 (Jerry says
VW uses 12).
    The system costs $1,500 (plus S &amp; H?). Jerry said he would install himself
for $750 and to allow three days if he did the work. He assured me that any
competent mechanic could do the job.
    More than this I do not know. Call Jerry for more information.
ttfn,
Bob
