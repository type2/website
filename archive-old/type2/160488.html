Subject: Re: [T2] Z bed won't fold, then it wouldn't unfold

James- Back when I had my original Z-bed,it was so
badly worn that it did all sorts of strange things.
Eventually, I removed the cushions (a major job in
itself!) and then replaced all the bolts that were
bent and went to larger bolts if I remember correctly,
where the holes were stretched - drilling the holes
out as needed. I got a few more years out of it after
that before I built a replica of the mechanism and got
some years out of that system. Eventually yanked it
all out and put in a modified Westy version which gave
me a lot more storage room under the seat and is much
lighter overall. -BaH
PS- Careful with those spare tire covers! Many years
ago a friend and I were setting out on a week-long
trip and I had decided I needed a new spare tire
cover. We simply ran out of time before the trip, so
the decision was made to &quot;...pick one up along the
way...&quot; On the second leg of our trip, cruising along
the far left lane of the freeway, something akin to a
tent suddenly appeared in front of me, billowing up
and luckily drifting over my bus as I sped beneath. My
freind, following in his Aerostar camper was not so
lucky and had the thing nail him, inflicting several
scratches and small dents on his brand-new van. As it
turned out, it was a spare tire cover off a truck or
motorhome and was big enough to fit over the noses of
our vans! After that we often joke about picking
things up &quot;on the way!&quot;

 Last weekend while camping our Z bed didn't want to
 go back to being a seat when we were breaking down
 to go home.
 
 I tried poking around with my finger to see if I
 could get something unhooked in the hinge, it
 suddenly released and went into a seat.
 
 I forgot about it.
 
 This weekend we went to turn it into a bed and it
 was stuck as a seat.
 
 When you push the back down the bottom lifts up
 stuck in the angle that it is in while made into a
 seat.
 
 Can somebody please tell me what is wrong and how to
 fix it.
 
 Thank you,
 
 James in Portland, Oregon that still can't get his
 new tire cover to fit
