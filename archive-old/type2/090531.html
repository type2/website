Subject: Idle and Stuttering - 78 2.0L F/I

Volks,

Just two days ago, I took Petunia, my beloved 78 Westy (2.0L/FI) from
Augusta, GA to King's Bay, GA - some 250 miles. I travelled at 60mph all
the way. And loved it, even on the Interstate!

Prior to departure, she ran perfectly - idled at startup. I did, however,
tighten what appeared to be a loose #3 cylinder head temp sensor. She ran
fine through the whole trip - no problems at all. Unfortunately, I woke the
next day to discover poor idle/cut-out at startup, and now &quot;stuttering&quot;
similar to what has happenened in the past with a loose #3 sensor. &quot;Stuttering&quot; only happens _at_ low RPMs, but it does sound as though the engine's missing when I'm at speed. Just a little. I just checked the #3 sensor, and it's still tight.

I'm not going to mislead anyone - the whole FI thing remains a relative
mystery to me, even after perusing Sean's FI pages and the Bosch L-Jetronic
Manual which is linked from his library. I really don't know where to start
in diagnosing and correcting this problem.

I did come across some reference to a #2 sensor - where's that?

I sincerely hope y'all can point me in the right direction/hold my hand,
as I'm 250 miles away from home, here for a month, and with little space
and few tools at my disposal.

Help me keep Petunia alive!

Thanks,

Justin L. Smith
