Subject: Re: [T2] deck height

Do not use head gaskets....

The deck problems are not uncommon with cofap pistons.. Measure the distance
from piston top to the top of the wrist pin bore, and the results will tell
if you have a piston issue, measure the distance from the seating area on
the cylinder to the case, to the seating area of the head. All the
measurements taken shoul be within .002 at the absolute most from each
other.

Do not shim individual cylinders more than the  other, it will cause head
leaks, deck shims may vary on opposing sides of the engine, but not on each
individiual cylinder, on the same side of  the engine..

My guess is that the engine case is not consistant, I have seeen them vary
.035!!!

Subject: [T2] deck height


&gt; I'm rebuilding my '78 2l and yesterday measured the following deck
heights:
&gt; #1 .043
&gt; #2 .045
&gt; #3 .051
&gt; #4 .033!
&gt; What gives??? Long rod? Shoddy crank grind? The p/c's are new Cofap 94mm.
&gt; Can I shim just one cylinder? Seems like I'd have problems getting the
heads
&gt; to seal if I did.  My new AMC heads came with a warning not to use head
&gt; shims.  This is my first T4 rebuild and I could really use some advise.
