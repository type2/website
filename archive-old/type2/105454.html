&gt; It is broke. I explained in an earlier post that this hard plastic hose
&gt; stops about 5&quot; from the front of the engine compartment. It appears the
&gt; P.O. slipped some cloth covered rubber hose over the end then on to the
&gt; high pressure side of the fuel ring.  The joint between the plastic and
&gt; rubber hose is leaking. Im trying to find out if this plastic hose is
&gt; supposed to go through the engine tin and connect to the fuel ring, or
&gt; is the joint to the rubber hose before the fuel ring normal.

Yes, that's the original configuration.  The hard plastic hose stops short
of the front engine tin and the high pressure fuel injection hose (sounds
like you have the original hose there if it's cloth covered) takes over from
there.

&gt; Is this plastic hose available anywhere?

I'm going to guess that it's not since the online vendors who sell
&quot;complete&quot; fuel injection hose replacement kits, as far as I know, don't
include it in their &quot;kits.&quot;

&gt; Should I replace it all the way to the fuel pump with F.I. rated rubber
&gt; hose? If so what size?

I have a feeling that this hard plastic stuff is somehow better suited for
the environment it lives in then the normal flexible FI hose.  Many, many
years ago I had a similar situation to the one you describe so I just
shortened the hard plastic hose an inch or so and lengthened the flexible FI
hose an inch or so and all has been fine ever since.
