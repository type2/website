&gt;So I finally located the '91 and man, I tell you.  I'm sooo glad

&gt;sweet.  And after driving it, it's character really grows on you.
&gt;I know this is true because I never liked bugs either until I
&gt;was an owner of one.  They're like stray dogs that just need love
&gt;and attention.

Woof!

&gt;Mine may not be best of show, but I certainly wouldn't trade it
&gt;or one of my wheels for 'Da Boat' (Ouch!).

&lt;I'm lying on the ground bleeding from that sucker-punch&gt;

&gt;                                               But.......  That
&gt;doesn't mean that I don't appreciate your van.  It has a charm
&gt;all it's own and were I in the right place at the right time,
&gt;I probably would've purchased it too.

Okay Steve, it's too late to be condescending!  :-)  Let's just say
that if I put *half* of the money into my bus that you spent on yours,
it would be all over your bus:

Paint Job &amp; Body Work       $2,000
Fix A/C                       $500
2.7l Porsche six from W. K. $2,500
Heated seats, 200 watt alpine stereo w/ CD changer, alloy wheels, tinted
windows, new uphostery in back, etc. etc. etc.      $5,000

Oh well, I can dream, can't I?
