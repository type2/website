Subject: [T2] Dead coil?  Weird coincidence!

&quot;Borrowed coil installed, good spark from it.  Still doesn't start.

I guess at this point, I need to check that the cylinders are actually
getting fuel, so this is where I get to learn about the Bosch FI, I
guess.  I went hunting for loose/disconnected wires and came up empty,
so I guess it's time to go through the FI diagnostic procedures in the
Bentley manual.&quot;

It could be an FI problem but before that I would confirm that your spark
is getting to all 4 cylinders. You could have a bad plug wire. Also all of
this trying to start it when the coil was dead has probably soaked your
spark plus with gas. I would pull the plugs and maybe consider new ones if
they don't look good. Oh and finally before you go tearing into the FI make
sure that the wire on the - side of the coil that talks to the FI is
connected well. Mine was loose and I had all sorts of weird symptoms. I
once forgot to hook that wire up and it took me a day to figure out why my
bus would not start... Good luck and keep us posted.
