Subject: RE: Beard with Respirator/DeltaCoat/airless paint sprayer

  I work in the Air force and do Respiratory protection for the my base and
wanted to clear up some obvious misconceptions to the proper use of
respirators.

&quot;I use a respirator occasionally and have a beard, you will smell *some*
fumes, as opposed to not smelling any fumes at all, but unless you decide to
paint for a living, you won't inhale enough dangerous stuff to harm you.
Most solids that do make it past the unsealed mask will be filtered by your
beard.&quot;

   Sorry but you are not smelling fumes but vapors...and it depends on the
odor threshold how much you are actually exposed to when you smell the
vapors...you say that you wont inhale enough dangerous stuff to harm
you...again I disagree...ever hear about Isocyanates?. About one out of
twenty people who work with isocyanates becomes &quot;sensitized&quot; to them. Being
&quot;sensitized&quot; to isocyanates means that you may have an asthma attack any
time you are exposed to them, even to extremely small amounts. Sensitivity
to isocyanates can be permanent. Also, continuing to work with isocyanates
after you become sensitized can cause asthma itself to become permanent, so
that attacks can occur even without any further exposure to isocyanates.
Once you become sensitized, you cannot continue to work in any job where you
could be exposed to isocyanates. These are chemicals in poly paints and in
hardeners...Osha law states that you cannot be exposed to more than
0.045mg/m3 for an 8 hour period..and if you paint in an area with no
mechanical ventilation &quot;paint booth&quot; I can say that theses levels can be
reached very easily..

Osha regs are only law in the workplace and cannot be enforced anywhere
else, but they can be a useful guide to safety issues for the &quot;do it your
selfer&quot;.
