Subject: Re [T2] Fuel injectors / pressure

Barry: I'd like to add one  little tip to your excellent description 
of how to check injectors.  I happened to do this on a fuel injected 
bug, but the ideas should apply to Type 2s.

The last time I pulled the engine, I brought a wire up from terminal 
50  of the starter solenoid and let it hang near the + terminal of 
the battery. Jamming this onto the battery terminal makes a fine 
remote starter.

To check my injector spray patterns, I pulled #1 and #2 injectors and 
wired them to face a piece of cardboard at normal incidence. I 
happened to place the cardboard about six inches from the injector 
nozzle.

After pulling the coil/distributor wire as you did, I cranked the 
engine and could observe the spray in real time.

One thing I just thought of, however. The DPO wired my ECU to allow 
the fuel pump to turn on at the first click of the ignition key.  For 
ECUs that are correctly wired, the fuel pump is activated during 
cranking and when air is sweeping through the intake air sensor. 
Maybe neither of these conditions is present with a remote starter. 
I'll have to think about it.

Otherwise, you could crank  from the ignition switch and observe the 
stains on the cardboard.

Jack
