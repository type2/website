Subject: 12v fridge question....answer not in archive ( yet )
Date: Mon, 25 Sep 2000 19:38:08 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

My Electrolux gas powered fridge has a 12v battery backup wired in so you
can use your engine to keep the thing going while driving.....thing is, the
manual rambles on and on about 7-core wiring etc , etc which I have, but
seems that I can only trace ONE of these wires going to the rear of the
fridge.
I ASSUME that the one wire I have is a Battery (+) positive and that all I
need to do is wire this lead into the battery with a switch to select on/off
(or the ignition) and that should power the unit.Once again assuming that
the other wire at the rear of the fridge is grounded to the chassis.
WHY THEN THE OTHER 5 WIRES ?????
Is it possible to test this circuit with a voltmeter  before wasting time
connecting it up?
Thanks as ever to all
Garp
