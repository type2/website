Subject: Oil everywhere (1700 Type 4)

My bet is the cases being pressurised by either a
blocked breather pipe, over full oil level or a
serious case of blowby.

Did it start suddenly or after some fiddling or did it
do it all by itself?

The t4 engine can also pop a few different gallery
plugs too.  (dont ask...)
