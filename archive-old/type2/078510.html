Subject: Re: [T2] 71 Westy Rear Seat/Bed Question

[...]

If you have or are planning to have rear seat belts then don't try to reproduce what VW did.  They are a joke from a safety viewpoint.  I know that VW replaced this with something more substantial in the 73 Westy.  You can probably find something that is about ten times better at your local hardware store.

&gt;I'm trying to get this bus in shape and I've discovered that 1) the catches on the sides of the rear seat have been partially broken off and 2) the latches that secure the seat down have nowhere to latch to.  Does anyone have pictures or drawings of these pieces that would help me to fabricate these?  For the side catches, I've got a bar of aluminum that I'm going to make replacement part out of, but I just need some sort of template to go by.  It appears that there is a notch that mates with a stud coming out of the seat bracket, as well as a smaller hole.  Does the smaller hole have a function?
