&gt; I read the article by Ken Hooper in the library section on timing for a 009,
&gt; but I still have a question.

The man is an idiot, seek a second opinion.

&gt;I have a 71 Westy with what I was told was a
&gt; Mexican type 1 engine (it has no engine numbers on it), it also has oversize
&gt; cylinders so it is at 1832cc, and a 009 dist. I am trying to time it and
&gt; currently have it at TDC running around 850-900rpm. Should I rev it til
&gt; there is no more advance and then set the 30degree mark on the wheel to TDC?

If you really have a Mexican engine your compression ratio is so low that
you can safely go higher. But you're bored out, you don't know what your CR
is, you don't know what you have. Bob Hoover used to call the process
&quot;work-up&quot;, you advance the timing then drive, do this until it pings, then
back off. Summer is different than winter.

A nifty EMPI degree pulley is worth the money.

Sometimes my wife can hear ping while sitting in the back seat even though I
think everything is fine. Get somebody to listen in the back.
