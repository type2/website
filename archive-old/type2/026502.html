&gt;My emergency brake is a brick. I carry it in the back of my bus. I 
&gt;just stick it behind the back wheel when I park on an incline if there 
&gt;isn't a curb to turn the wheels against.

Makes a great theft deterent too!  

Would-be thief sees bus.  Would-be thief sees brick.  Would-be thief thinks,
&quot;Aha!  A bus owner that was kind enough to leave me something to break the
window with - does it get any better than this?&quot;  Would-be thief removes
brick from back wheel and bus begins to roll backwards, crushing his foot in
the process.  By now, the bus is already a block away and moving at at least
25 mph - no WAY this thief with the broken foot is gonna catch it now!!
Police arrive on seen (the guy's been screeming something about a broken
foot while hopping up and down holding a brick).  They then arrest the guy
for stealing the brick from it's rightfull owner, Nancy H :-).

Sorry, couldn't resist....
