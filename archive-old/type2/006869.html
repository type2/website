David and list,

Isn't that exactly the advantage of synthetics -- that they don't break
down? High heat oxidizes conventional oil and thickens it. Synthetics
resists thickening better.

http://rconcepts_dot_com/beard/dragnet/drag/oilinfo.html points to a page
called &quot;More Than You Ever Wanted to Know About Motor Oil&quot; which is very
informative. The following is a quote:

&quot;All are &quot;good enough&quot;, but those with the better numbers are icing on
the cake. The more expensive synthetics; AMSOIL, Mobil 1, and Spectro
offer the only truly significant differences, due to their superior high
temperature oxidation resistance, high film strength, very low tendency
to form deposits, stable viscosity base, and low temperature flow
characteristics. Synthetics are superior lubricants compared to
traditional petroleum oils.&quot;
