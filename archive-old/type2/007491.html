Hey everyone! Sorry I sent a million messages to you all. That was my first time posting and I screwed it up. I know you have a lot of other messages to read. I'm just getting used to receiving up to 100 e-mails a day. How does anyone find the time to get out and drive their VW's? Thanks for your help! Alexis '70 camper
