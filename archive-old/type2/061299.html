- If 185/14 is a 80 series tire
&gt;then the 70 series would be a 205, not a 195. I think that 205 is too
&gt;wide for a stock bus rim.

I have 205/70/R14 on the Turtle.  They fit,(just clear the shocks on the
inside), and the diameter is very close to stock.  The extra tread width
steadies the bus a bit in the corners.
