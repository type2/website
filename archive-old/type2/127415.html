Subject: Weber carb Vac line placement....

Ok, when running a weber carb with a dual vac dizzy on
a T4 engine, where do the vac lines go?? There is a
big port (like 1/4&quot; at the base of the center of the
intake manifold, I assume this one is for the brake
booster) but there is also a small port on the rear of
the carb (rear is rear) and there is another small
port on the right (passenger) side of the carb. So
which is advance, which is retard, etc. etc.
Also, I'm not sure about the dizzy on this engine.
Should there even be a DUAL vac dizzy on a 1700 engine?
