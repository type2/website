Hello Volks!
    I have to agree with those who feel that the theft of a VW Bay window is very close to highly unlikely, but like they say &quot; When you least expect it.....Expect It.  I however am experienced in having had two vehicles stolen and recovered, IT CAN HAPPEN!  &quot;Janis&quot; my '71 Westy was stolen two weeks after I got her, by this &quot;Barfly's&quot; sisters boyfriend's cousin!  But the Busma was with me and my beloved Janis (of 14 yrs), seems that the fuel solenoid fell out and she ran out of gas!  My Olds was also stolen but keeping only 2 gal of gas in it only gets the thief to the next mall. Ha! };&gt;)

But seriously,  incapacitating the bus will keep anybody but a rollback from letting them drive off with it, like take the fuse to the starter out or the rotor button from the dist, heck take the neg. strap off the batt.

May the Busma keep you and yours Safe!
