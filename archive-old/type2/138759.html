Subject: Speedometer gear for 80 Vanagon

Well I have searched the archives for over an hour trying to find a supplier
of speedometer gears with no luck. Does anyone out there know where I can get
a new gear? I found a lot of references to having speedo shops replace the
gear, they must get them somewhere. There is no such thing as a speedo shop in
northern Arizona.
Any help would be greatly appreciated. If someone has a speedo from an 80 that
has a good gear, I have a dash panel from a 70 with a good speedo for trade.
Tom
