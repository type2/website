&gt; With the windshield out, it's real easy to undo the 5 or 6 screws that hold
&gt; the upper, metal portion of the dash to the front sheet metal of the bus.
&gt; After this, loosen the two big phillips screws on each of the door posts
&gt; (might need impact driver) and the whole thing flops around pretty well.
&gt; Enough, I would say, for you to put some insulation between the plastic and
&gt; the metal you're working on.

thanks that was the information I was looking for, so you pull the glass
first then do the work then put the dash back then the window??

yes I was gonna use a protecter of some sort between the dash and the
welding to protect things.

thanks
Bob
