&gt; Do regular and high test really have different densities?  Back when I was
&gt; in college we had to use a special motor-driven test engine with variable
&gt; compression and standard fuels to measure octane rating accurately.

ah, ye olde empirical method.

(disclaimer:  this is all based on stuff i learned years ago, so please feel
               free to correct me if i'm wrong or fill in any details i've left out)

from what i understand regarding octane ratings, they're based on a somewhat 
misleading premise anyway.  

Every (?) hydrocarbon (carbon-based chains with hydrogen bonded to it, e.g. 
propane, butane, hexane, octane, etc.) has a specific octane rating associated 
with it, and if i recall correctly, this rating is based on chemical bond
strength and how much energy is released on breaking these chemical bonds. 
The fuel you put in your gas tank is a mixture of lots of different 
hydrocarbons, all of which somehow average out to the advertised octane rating.  

I assume that the different octane ratings (RON v. ???) use a different
set of rules to find this &quot;average&quot; octane rating that you see on the
pump, and, probably have different rules as to what hyrdrocarbons
are allowed in the primordial mixture we call gasoline -- as some 
are more toxic than others, but have high octane ratings and would
bring up the octane rating.  As it stands, gasoline mixtures
change seasonally anyway, as octane rating does not necessarily 
correspond to how something burns, so even though you might have
the same octane fuels from 2 separate gas stations, they could 
burn A LOT differently -- hence the suggestion that while 
changing fuel grade may *not* help your engine, changing gas
stations might -- assuming that the other gas station uses a different
mixture for their gasoline, and that this mixture might affect how
it burns and that it might be more &quot;right&quot; for your engine.

So, what is the &quot;octane&quot; rating good for?  Of that, I'm not quite
sure...  Probably somehwere in the &quot;rules&quot; for computing octane
ratings (where RON and other systems would have different &quot;rules&quot;)
they allow or disallow certain hydrocarbons for determining
the rating, amongst other criteria, and the resulting octane then 
somehow correlates to how fast that fuel burns and/or how completely 
it burns, but I really have no clue.
