Subject: Re: [T2] Aluminium or Magnesium case for type 1

Guys,

So what about taking an aluminum case and sending it to one of the
vendors like Rimco or someone and paying them to blueprint it?

Cheers, dave

&gt; It's not the material that is the problem.  It's the fact that the
&gt; machining on the aluminum cases is not accurate.  VW does not make the
&gt; aluminum type 1 cases.  They are made by the aftermarket.  If they could
&gt; machine them right they would be winners.
