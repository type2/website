&gt; So i do 1 rebuild during that time, and then we are ready to rebuild both,
&gt; assuming we still own our busses (100,000 miles is a long way!)
&gt; I have mine out in 20 minutes. I rebuild it with new bearings new top end. I
&gt; spend about $400 or I could get a used engine for about $350. Then its 20
&gt; minutes back in. And you spend how much? Double? or more? Type 1 is the way
&gt; to go.

This type 1 vs type 4 debate could go on and on, but one thing we need to be
careful of is giving bad advice that might cost someone a large amount of
time and money.

I hate hearing about people putting a type 1 engine in their bus when it was
meant for a type 4 thinking they are making an improvement.

I've worked on VW's since 1973 when I worked in a small VW shop.  I have
built numerous sand rails with all kinds of engines, type 1, type 4, pinto
and aluminum buick/olds V8.  In a bug and buggy, the type 1 engine is MUCH
better, it will &quot;rap&quot; out quicker because of a lighter
flywheel/crank/rod/piston combo.  Fast rapping is great when you have a
small load to push.

In a heavy bus, the type 1 engine will not hold up under the load, hills are
slower and the life of the engine is shorter.  Having a type 1 westy is even
harder on the little engines.

Type 4 engines don't cost that much more to build, look in the magazines and
price a type 1 long block, then a type 4 long block.

Any engine can be distroyed easily by the right person doing the wrong
things such as having a bad driving technique or not keeping the engine
tuned or maintained.  But a type 4 engine does have a much longer life while
giving out more torque that will flatten out the hills better than a type 1
engine can.

If you've never experienced for yourself the rebuilding, driving, or owning
of a type 4 engined bus, please don't say these engines are expensive to
rebuild or no good, you are giving out hear-say and uneducated advice.
