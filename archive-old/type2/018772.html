I would say that you have a bad solenoid, these tend to go rather
quickly, but they like to mess with the mind first, start, no start, no
start, start..you get the picture..Test the solenoid by removing the
starter, ground it to a fresh battery, touch the red cable to solenoid
terminl (hold on to starter on the ground, it will kick), it will work
if it's good, if not, you solenoid is toast..have it rebuilt or replace
if possible.
