&gt;  I'm trying to install a stereo into my roommate's '71 bus.  I have
&gt;pounded, ground, and otherwise jammed the stereo into the dash, but I am
&gt;having problems with the wiring.  Could someone tell me what I should
&gt;connect the &quot;Constant power&quot; and &quot;Ignition/power&quot; wires to?

i am not an expert on wiring. but here i go. i would connect the
ignition/power to the positive wire on the back of the stereo.

most all stereos i have come across are the same. on the back of the unit
you will have either a thick black cable for the antenna coming out w/ an
adapter for your antenna or you will just have a hole on the back of the
unit to plug your antenna into.

next you will have an assortment of wires coming out. one is for ground
(black?), one is for positive(red?)-the power-, and the others will be your
speakers. most of the time your speakers are pretty clear to figure out. say
left + speaker would be blue and left negative would be blue with a white
stripe. they usually pair em up. on newer stereos you'll run into more than
just left and right speaker bundles...you may end up with 2 sets of wires
for the front and 2 sets for the back speakers. newer systems usually come
with a &quot;remote&quot; wire or plug-in which is for add-ons like amplifiers or cd
changers or equalizers.

best regards, dave :)

PS...be careful if you cannot figure out which is the positive lead. it
should be clearly marked. i recently installed a stereo for a friend and the
positive was an orange wire w/ a white stripe (good thing it had a color
chart on the top of the unit!)
