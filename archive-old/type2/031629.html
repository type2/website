&gt; here in Virginia, we need a front license plate.
&gt; 
&gt; so, how does everyone attach this damn thing?  i need it mounted to pass 
&gt; inspection.

I drill two holes in the bumper and then put sheet metal screws through
the bottom holes of the tag...tag sit above the bumper....below and it
WILL get bent up, ask me how I know.....

&gt; infamous....STATE INSPECTION!  wish me luck!

yeah I gotta go get a smog reinspection this week.... have spent enough
money on the stuff so even if I don't pass I have spent enough to &quot;buy a
waiver&quot;.  Only allowed on older vehicles if you spend more than $250 on
fixing smog related stuff, problem is if you have someone else do it they
count the labor, but if you do it yourself they only count the cost of
parts, oh well I needed the new muffler and valve seats anyway... in fact
I was waiting to get em until after my first test so the price would count
towards the waiver.

still can't get it to idle right though?!?!?

good luck
Bob
