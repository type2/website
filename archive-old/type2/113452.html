There is only one way to verify a GEX motor will last 5000 miles. Either 
run it 5000 miles and see what happens or, tear it down and spec everything 
and replace all the out of spec parts. Patch it up and cross your fingers, 
or save/time money and get a GOOD long block. A good long block 5000 miles 
from now will not be cheaper than a good long block now. What is a good 
long block???? All clearances checked by the machinist and rechecked by the 
assembler. GEX checks next to nothing, but they put out a hundred a week so 
every once in a while a &quot;good&quot; one will get by them and will last 30,000 
miles, one third to one sixth the life of a good long block. Pay three 
times the money and get six times the life, what a bargain.

&gt;i know gex rebuilds are shotty so should I:
&gt;
&gt;a)replace the gasket &amp; slap the motor back together hoping that the
&gt;compression problem will be fixed
&gt;
&gt;b)have the lower end checked out
&gt;
&gt;c)have the upper end inspected and possibly rebuild the entire top end to
&gt;fix the low quality GEX heads
&gt;
&gt;this is my first vw so i want to fix things right the first time. however,
&gt;the bus has been parked in the garage for over 6 months as i try and
&gt;acquaint my self with the motor. i would like to get it on the road as
&gt;soon as possible but dont want be forced to drop the motor again in
&gt;another 5,000 miles.
