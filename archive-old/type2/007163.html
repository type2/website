Hi everyone,

I've joined in the hope that somebody can help us! I know you can...

I have a 1979 Westy that my trusted mechanic was checking the brakes on. He
discovered a leak and decided to rebuild the master cylinder but discovered
that the leak is coming from a piece of rubber hose (?) that connects the
brake-fluid reservoir to the master cylinder. He said that it is a part that
is no longer available from his usual parts supplier. We live in Dallas, TX
so I imagine we have some good resources there...

Anyway - does anybody know what this part is called or even a part number
and better still where we can get one. He has been to three rubber supply
houses here and none of them had anything that would work.

Thanks, Les
