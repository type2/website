Subject: Love Bug's maiden voyage to EB 2001 VERY LONG!
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

    I wasn't going to post a trip report but I had a few inquiring minds
want to know how the Love Bug's first camping event went.  For those of
you who are new to the list,  or for any who are interested, The Love
Bug is a trailer similar to a Puck more like a Cassitta (am I right
Rick?) which one tows behind a vehicle to camp with.  It was built in'73
by a company called Tri-Fab in Tripoli, Iowa.  You can see pics at
http://www.home.earthlink_dot_net/~theauchs/Lovebug.htm.  The trailer weighs
900 lbs GVW.  My trip started on Thursday evening.  For the two years
before this years event, I had planned to attend Everybus.  Nothing was
going to stop me this year.  I told Casey my 5 year old that we would
hike to the camp out if the bus didn't make it ;0)  Everything was set
to take off early Thursday and arrive in Harpers Ferry, WV where my wife
currently resides (I'll follow with my girls this summer, that's a whole
nother story).  Tuesday the plane start to change.  My lacrosse team's
game was postponed til Thursday at 4:30.  I was fuming!  Well, after the
game I hitched up The Love Bug and loaded Casey into Woody my '70
westy.  The bus pulled the trailer very well for only having a 1600 DP.
Hills were a bit of a strain but 50-55 mph over hills wasn't too bad.
After 3-4 hours of childrens tapes I was ready to be in my wife's arms.
    I got up early, and finished my last minute preparing before I
headed for Round Hill to meet Jeff S. and the Canadian Connection.  I
made it there at 10:05 am and they were chomping at the bit to go.  I
finally got to meet Dave Ireland face to face after about three years of
correspondence over the net.  We said our hellos and got going to Opal
for the scheduled meeting place.  After the stop and meeting up with a
few more buses, we now totaled 11 strong!  This was quite a sight as we
drove through the Virginia countryside.  We stopped in Charlottesville
at the Walmart to get goodies and any supplies that we forgot.  Jamie
Rivers took a quick temperature reading of my bus.  210 degrees, not to
bad after towing the trailer 3 hours.  I got to buy a HW drag bus while
we were there!  We loaded up at 2:00 and took off down 29 S.  The drag
on the Love Bug was quite noticeable as we hit some pretty hefty hills.
Jeff S. was losing power while pulling his trailer so we ended up
stopping a couple times to see if a correction could be made.
    We finally got to Lynchburg where we we scheduled to have a gas
stop.  I radioed that I was very low and that I needed to fuel up ASAP.
I was told the gas station was a mile up the road.  I was 1 mile shy as
Woody stalled out in the middle of an intersection in Lynchburg Rush
hour traffic.  Tom from PA in his red and black bus stopped and was
planning to tow me out of the intersection.  Tom's starter stuck, but we
got it going to back up to Woody and The Love Bug.  I wish I had some
pictures of a Baywindow towing a baywindow towing a Love Bug! Tom got me
to the next intersection off the highway, when Sean B. arrived.  Sean
went to get gas while Tom and I shot the shit and we Casey's photograph
models.  Sean arrived, gassed up the bus and off we went to meet the
others.
    We arrived and discovered that Steve was still not running right.  I
thought I was losing a little power also, so Sean and Jamie check my
timing.  Of course I haven't put on my degree wheel yet for my 009 so
trying to set the timing was a crap shoot!  We headed off and stopped at
the very next gas station.  I have done a lot of bar hopping in my days
but gas station hopping?  Steve was still dragging ;0(  I look around
and there was my wife!  Boy did I ever get ribbed about how we had a 4.5
hour start on her and she caught up to us &lt;LOL&gt;.  We we ready once again
to get going and the next thing I heard was that Tom's steering box
snapped off of his front axle.  Tom had found a good ole boy to rent him
his shop to do some welding and he said that he would catch up with us
later.  Well, a couple hours later and only a few miles down the road,
we were still in Lynchburg.  We ended getting kicked of some guys
parking lot who said he did not want any press or photos taken.  Who
knows what he was hiding?
    We finally headed south again. By that time, we were all ready to be
there and I went ahead od the pack to use some trucker style driving to
help get over the hills.  The 1600 pulls well, and Gordon brightened my
day when he told me how impressed he was at my buses ability to tow the
Love bug.  I was still having trouble on the hills and it was slowly
getting worse.  My accelerator pedal had come apart and I radioed the
carabus to take off without me.  I had my wife following just in case.
Steve Dolan also stopped, he missed my transmission to go on.  The
diagnosis was that the hinge pin was rusted in place, there was no
spring and we just had to wing it.  We got it rigged up and low and
behold. here rolls in Tom.  He welded up his bus and caught up to us!
Three buses and a Camry rolled on in the North Carolina night.  We
arrived at Everybus around 10:00 PM, twelve and a half hours after Casey
and I took off from Harpers Ferry.  What a day!  But, the camaraderie
was great and the company a lot of fun.  We rolled into Hagan Stone Park
to wall to wall buses.  There wasn't much room for many more buses and I
was afraid we were going to be one of the unfortunate. Jamie River's
daughter Vicky waved us down and showed us where our carabus set up
their elaborate camp.  On the way there, I stopped to talk to Dave
Parsons and Emmet McGovern. The graciously offered me some space but
maneuvering the Love Bug at night and after the day we had was a bit
much for this kooky math teacher.(later Dave told me that I was actually
twitching while talking to him  ;0)  We pulled up along the outskirts of
our partners on the road and got ready to bed down.  What a pleasure it
was just to open the Love Bugs door and be ready to camp!
    Saturday morning came way to early.  I stumbled out of The Love Bug,
and had my breath taken away by the sight of buses, buses, buses!  Old
ones, new ones, red ones , blue ones, green ones, yellow ones and two
tones.  You get my drift.  It was a wondrous sight.  I met some old and
new friends and the karma was amazing.  Casey and Frannie Potts were
stuck together like glue all weekend, that made it easy on Christina and
me. Saturday evening was a blast, with awesome chili and great folks.
Casey beamed as she received a Coca-Cola splittie HW donated by Dave
Parsons. The Blue grass band was excellent to end the evenings
festivities.  I did finally get to retrieve my side tent from Den
Joliffe after a year and a half.  I was supposed to pick it up at the
last Everybus but I did not make it.
This was an incredible experience and I want to thank all for the
wonderful company especially The Canadian Connection ( Jamie Rivers and
family, Colli, Greg Potts and family, Dave Ireland, Den and Ev
Jolliffe), Jeff S. and family, Tom from PA, Howard, Sean B., H. Steve
Dolan, Emmet and Tracy McGovern and my good buddy Dave Parsons. The
biggest thank you goes to Chris who should be very proud of organizing
this incredible event and who I finally got to meet face to face.

What would I do different next year?  Put in a two liter ;0)

Thanks all,
Jamie Auch
kooky math teacher
