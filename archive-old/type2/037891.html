Subject: Vanagon fuel pressure problem

List

My fuel pressure gauge now reads 42-50 psi while the engine is running/~65
with the vacuum hose disconnected, It did read normally the last time I had
the engine cover off.. Bentley calls for 29 psi running/36psi with hose off.
Cleared fuel return line with air, replaced the pressure relief valve with a
new one with no changes. any thoughts or suggestions?

Thanks

Bill
