Subject: Re: [T2] It's not the bulbs after all....

I had a car that behaved this way when one of the turn
signal bulbs had burned out (like one of the rear
ones) while the front one still worked. The faster
flashing was the indication to the operator that there
was a bulb out. I don't know if v-dubs do this though.
I would get out and do a thorough check just in case. 
Just my 2 cents.

&gt; I posted recently about the left side flashers
&gt; blinking on and off much more
&gt; rapidly then the right side, figuring I'd gotten
&gt; mis-matched bulbs.  
&gt; I also noticed
&gt; that the emergency flashers aren't working; when I
&gt; try them the indicator
&gt; light on the dash just goes steady green, and
&gt; nothing's happening
&gt; flasher-wise.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody have a contrary opinion about the source of
&gt; my problem?
