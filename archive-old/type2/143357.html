Subject: Re: [T2] curtains

&gt; i did two curtains / panels for each of the sliders, rear side windows and
&gt; the rear hatch.
&gt; i did one each for pass and drivers window and one for the front
&gt; window.  that
&gt; makes 13.
&gt;

I see. The one I have is a full wraparound that covers the windshield, and
both doors.

Spent a few minutes last night trying to find that turd brown curtain, but
it's in a box somewhere. Sigh.
