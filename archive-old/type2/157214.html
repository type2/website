Subject: A/C Freon capacity

I now have my A/C installed.  I have about 12 cans of the old Freon 12 still around.  (I may have some more, but I haven't looked for it yet).  Does anyone know the capacity of the system for a '72 Bus?  This is a single unit, mounted just behind the front seats on the headliner.  The entire system is NOS except the compressor.
