Subject: brown wire revisited and no spark

Several people helped me with a wire I forgot to label.
One person talked about a white wire with brown cover and Richard 
Atwell wrote:
It's normally a white wire on terminal 1 of the coil going to the ECU 
via the wiring harness. The other terminal connects to the backup 
lights fuse and the heater booster fan only.

Ok which terminal is terminal 1 ?

Coil has a total of 5 terminals two on the bottom and three up top.

Reading Bentley tells me if I have coil wires backwards I will get weak 
spark - I am getting none at #4 plug pulled and grounded to rear lid 
catch.

The original unlabeled wire is just brown not white with brown 
insulation ( I do see that wire as well though)

Please help!!
