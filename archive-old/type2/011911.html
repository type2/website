Subject: smoke screen
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

list,
  My 74 dual carb bus has developed a interesting thing.
Now and then, after a mile or 2, it will produce a copious
amount of white smoke for about 30 seconds then quit
(smoking). It doesnt normally smoke (burn oil) and seems to
be running OK except for this little pop pop thing that
happens at idle now an then.
  I did run some fuel system cleaner through it. The next
day was the first time it did this. It didnt do it for a
week then once again... etc etc
  It only does it (so far) pretty soon after start up. I
have heard no &quot;funny&quot; noises before , during or after this
smoke screen occurs... scares the hell out of the people
behind me though!

   Any thoughts?
