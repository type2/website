Mike:
I'd have to throw in with John Connolly on this one. Here's what
happened when you changed engines (so nicely pointed out by Dr. Tim in
regard to the other current discussion!): The 74 1.8 engine is a higher
performance engine in every single specification EXCEPT displacement,
i.e., it has higher compression ratio, a hotter cam, substantially
bigger valves, intakes 41mm compared to 37.5mm on the 2.0, exhausts 34mm
compared to 33mm on the 2.0 (and sodium-cooled, too). The 1.8 was rated
at 68 hp (DIN ?) and the 2.0 was rated at 70 hp. The factory did not
come out with the 2.0 to go faster, they did it to make it torquier and
easier for their customers (mainly Americans) to drive. Carburetors are
touchy things to set up and it's really handy to have a chassis dyno or
other horsepower testing situation (top speed). Under certain conditions
with hotter cams, the reversion at certain speeds will actually make
fuel droplets stand off above the venturis, so shortening the intake
duration under this situation would probably richen the tailpipe reading
AT THIS RPM! That's simple enough, right? Not actually! The simple
solution, of course is that this combination HAS ALREADY BEEN ENGINEERED
the the esteemed HERREN ENGINEEREN! That's right, ROW (rest of world)
2.0 liter type 4 engined loafs and Vanagons used dual Solexes. Someone
in Britain, Germany, or Australia could enlighten us as to jetting
(seems like there are about 4 changeable metered devices in a 32-34
PDSIT).
That said, I'd have to agree with BOTH Dr. Tim and John Anderson in what
they said IN CONTEXT!
DR TIM: Put on BRAND NEW Solex carbs, LIFE IS SWEET! I'm sure it is, but
those new Solexes mighta been about the last ones in the country, and
few of us are as adept at you at setting them up. I've been there and it
was about the most difficult tune up job I've ever done!(Got it right,
though and it WAS SWEET!)
JOHN ANDERSON: Put later L-jetronic on anything, LIFE IS SWEET! This is
a lot of work, too, and with careful junkyard scrounging, maybe a little
cheaper. This is the route I've gone on my vehicles recently, and I've
driven HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES nearly completely trouble free.
Still, whenever I'm in a junkyard and see a set of Solexes, I usually
TAKE THEM HOME!!
(I'm not sure Dr. Tim is the right kind of doctor to straighten me out
on this one!)
