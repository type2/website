Subject: Re: [T2] hooking up second battery

Both a dynamo or an alternator are fine for charging two batteries at the same time. Some would say a dynamo is better as the lower power output will charge the battery slower.

The simplest system to set up is to use an ordinary four prong relay. 

Connect one side of the relay's coil to the regulator at the same point the red light wire is connected and the other side of the relay's coil to earth. The connect the   ve side of the two batteries one to each of the two remaining prongs of the relay - of course for safety you will include a fuse in one of the battery to relay wires too, say 20amp for a 30amp relay.

Then connect the -ve side of the second battery to the chassis using a ground strap of the same size as on the normal battery.

Don't forget to secure the second battery in place with some sort of battery hold down.

This set up is completely automatic (i.e. no manual switching to isolate a battery or to select which one to be used) and the two batteries are only connected when the engine is running and the red light is off.

If all your non driving electrics (radio, interior lights, inverter, water pump etc, etc) are connected to the second battery then the main battery will always be fully charged ready to fire up the engine.

If you should then have a flat driving battery but the second one is fully charged (eg. lights left on overnight outside your house) then because you have fitted a standard earth strap on the second battery you will need just one jump lead from   ve to   ve in order to start your engine.

Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; So what is the deal on how to set up a reserve battery in a 71 bus with the 
&gt; 1600. Does the generator have enough power to charge both. How should it be 
&gt; wired up, and when camping should you switch to use only one or that doesn't 
&gt; matter, I also want to put it in a 72 with a 2.0l, that is ours and the other 
&gt; is our sisters. thanks for the help
