Subject: Long distance travel in an aircooled...

I plan to drive my newly acquired '73 Bus from its current home in So Cal to
my home in the Frisco bay area. About 350+ miles. This is my first aircooled
automobile.

Assuming the vehicle is in reasonable running condition is there anything I
should do difference from what I would do if I were making this trip in a
water-cooled car?
