Subject: 55 MPH

I've been following this thread and it seems to come down to a religious
debate, similar to the great oil debate. For me, 60-65 mph is the top limit
for my 74; in hot weather, a little less. I adjust my speed according to
road conditions, oil temps and head temps. That being said, I agree with our
Casting Fool and obey the speed limits as posted (though not out of
scriptural doctrine).
I've also heard that tired old saw about how &quot;if you can't go 80 they'll run
over you.&quot; I haven't found this to be the case, even when driving in major
cities like Nashville, Atlanta, Detroit, and Cincinnati. I get some
interesting gestures from other drivers, but I've never been run over.
(Accidents do happen, I know.) Of course, I drive as defensively as possible
and bear in mind that morons are going to speed down the highways no matter
what.
Also, when it comes to the engine being teated by runnning at top end for
jillions of hours/miles, well, bear in mind that running a vehicle with a
brand new engine at top end on a test track for hours at a time is a far,
far different thing than driving a vehicle under everyday conditions. Just
because the engine can be run like that doesn't mean it should be. And
remember, driving at those speeds isn't only about the engine- it's also
about brakes and sterring and tires and suspension, etc. I have a Volvo
sitting in my yard that can do 135+ (don't ask me how I know!) but in its
current condition only a suicidal fool would attempt it.
Like a previous poster said, if I need speed, you'll find me in my '04
pickup which is capable of maintaining speeds far in excess of any posted
limit.

that's my $02. I'll stop now.
