Hey Folks,
   Well, this weekend I will finish painting my '77 Westy and start putting it all back together. My windshield is fogged along the lower 3-4 inches, and I hate to reinstall that one, so I set about looking for a replacement locally (N. Virginia). I seemed to remember some postings in the past few months about Safelite auto glass, and found it in the archives, from Ron _at_ Bus Depot, bus windshields for about $100.00 installed from Safelite. Well, that must have been a one time sale price, because two local Safelite stores quoted me $228.00 and $293.00! When I asked about purchasing just the glass and installing it myself (done it before-no problem) I was quoted $230.00 for just the glass! They told me the seal alone is $65.00! My, my, aren't they marking that up just a bit? I told them I've got the seal, paid less than $20.00 for it, person on the phone sounded surprised. Any local listee's  know where I can get a windshield at a reasonable price?  I'll even take one from a bone yard if I have to. As for Safelite, well, I had a very bad experience with them years ago, so I wasn't surprised.   TIA,  Jeff
