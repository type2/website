Mark, others

When I took apart my floor, it had a foam underlay followed by a thick
hardboard base. It then had lino tiles glued to this. It was okay but I
wanted a carpet and I had the chance to re-lay it (it was rotten in some
places).

So I used carpet underlay (I couldn't get foam), then the same thickness
hardboard. I used 3 pieces instead of trying to make one piece, as I
figured it was impossible to fit unless the van is completely empty (and I
had the wardrobe still in or something). I sealed the joins with flexible
silicone sealant, but it didn't seal too well. Then I glued a cut piece of
carpet, with a spray-on carpet adhesive bought at a show with the carpet.

The side (by the sliding door) had an aluminium edge trim already, so I
used that again. The front is cut exactly right and glued, also there is 
the air-vent trim between and just behind the seats, this is cut and bent
to about 135° to allow for the thickness. The back is not so important as
it is covered by a seat and cupboards.

The next van will have the same idea, but 4 pieces of 12mm MDF instead of
hardboard (I need to achieve a better edge, and MDF is lovely in this
respect. I think I'll be using some kind of thick rust-resistant paint on
the floor beforehand, as well.

RE:	Camper floor

I check the archives for this topic, and came away dissatisfied. If you 
were constructing a floor for a camper, how would you do it?

- how many layers?
- of what materials?
- who would you bind the sides and front?
- what glue(s)
- what kind of top surface?

Real experience appreciated, but not absolutely necessary
