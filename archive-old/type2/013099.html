Subject: not-so-smart fuse-box question...
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

i've just completed a major installing weekend
(including insulating and vapor barriering my front
doors) when i tried to wire in my new stereo.  i ran
into problems when it came to connecting the power to
the fuse box.  do i just remove the black box holding
teh fuse box (there's two little flat head screws)? i
just want to verify that the wire connections are made
to teh back of the fuse box and i won't kill my bus
taking that black box off. any reassuring words would
be appreciated.

have a great day,

tesa
