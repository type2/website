Subject: Deluxe Definiton?

Snoopy,
That one's not so easy to answer. It also varies depending on year and
country. A true Deluxe from the German factory had a 24 or 25 at the start of
the chassis number. Despite this all the little bits and pieces that made up a
deluxe were available as options on the entire range of bodies, and various
dealers and countries got batches of microbus's and Kombi's with some of them
as standard.
In general a Deluxe had two tone paint split at the body line, two tone
interior, chrome bumpers, body strip and window rubber beading among other
things.
Here in Australia, the only deluxe VW sold had a chassis number starting with
22 and was effectively a microbus with a few options added.
This was easy to do as most type It's sold here were very basic Kombi's, so a
microbus with a bit of chrome could be passes off as a Deluxe.
