Subject: RE: Westfalia insurancet

I insure my 75 bus and my 65 double cab on one
&quot;collector car&quot; policy, now that the 75 is 25 years
old.  They both have Wisconsin collector plates, and I
only drive them in nice weather.  Since I have other
vehicles as the primary year-around cars, I can get
the collector license plates, and the insurance
company that I use for them specializes in collector
and special vehicles.  I can't drive them as a
business vehicle or a regular work vehicle, and they
prefer using them for limited mileage, but that is
6000 miles or less a year each.
The insurance on both of them, collision and
comprehensive included, is $134 total!  They were
looked over and photographed inside and out by the
insurance agent, and then we had to wait a week for
the company to decide if they wanted to insure them,
but that total figure is about what I used to pay for
a regular liability-only policy on just one of them
for May through November (6months).  Now I insure them
both, year round, full coverage, for stated value (I
decided what they were worth), for about the same
amount of money.
Drawbacks- no one else can drive them other than my
wife, and no work use of the vehicles, and limited
mileage allowed--not a problem to me.
I'm 52 this year, but I don't know what difference age
makes.

Jim, in western Wisconsin
