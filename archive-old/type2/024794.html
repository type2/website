Subject: Fuel Injected To Dual Carbs
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I know that I will have to relocate and run a new throttle cable but does 
anyone know exactly which part number I need.  The old motor was a fuel 
injected 2 liter original motor.  The new motor is a 78 Dual carbed two liter 
and the link bar sets off to one side not right down the middle.  Will I be 
able to use the same tube?  I will be pulling off the exhaust system and rear 
hanging support bar to make the task easier.  Also I ran all new fuel lines 
at the motor and will be plugging off and disconnecting the fuel pump, then 
run a new fuel line.  The cost of this dual carb motor was a whopping 250 
bucks.  So bye for now fuel injection hope to see it again in the future.  am 
I forgetting anything else???
Peace Out
