Subject: engine coughing

Listees,
     I have a 70 Westy that is my daily driver. I was on one of my normal 60
mile trips travelling b/n 55 &amp; 60 mph when she suddenly sputtered or
coughed. No matter what I did with the gas pedal, I couldn't get her to
respond. Then just as quickly as it happened, it stopped. When I got to my
destination, I checked the fuel filter, and it was loaded with garbage. I
replaced it and the ride home was problem free.
    Next day, I am on another 60+ mile trip travelling about 55-60 mph and
the same thing happens. I check the filter, all looks fine. I head back
towards home and at one point she won't go over 45 mph. I stop see nothing
out of the ordinary and decide to continue to my destination 5 miles away.
No problems the last 5 miles at city speeds 35-45 mph.
     I visit my mechanic, he suggests the points or trash in the carb at the
needle valve. I replace the points and clean the top half of the carb. Same
thing happens at 55-60 mph.
    Any suggestions.
Later,
Jim
