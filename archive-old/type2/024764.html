X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I have a couple of intertwined questions that are getting a touch more 
poignant now that engine reinstallation is coming up. The basics:

75 Westy with a once-FI engine. Dopey PO converted it to DFAV and 009 (among 
other craziness from said DPO). He never got it all working well, from the 
appearance of the innards of the engine...very rich.

I had intended to reconvert it to FI, but found a complete 2.0 FI engine 
which I will build &quot;right&quot;, so I'm reinstalling, temporarily, the 1.8 after 
fixing most of the outrageous misdeeds of the DPO.

I have, in addition to the DFAV and the 009, a dual vacuum dizzy from the 2.) 
FI.

Here is the question(s):

Which dizzy is likely to work best with the DFAV? I have figured out how to 
get heat to the manifold pipes, and I would like to have the best possibility 
for the advance curve, but I'm not certain that the DFAV will have correct 
vacuum above and below the butterfly. I have no problem making my own holes 
for the vacuum, but I'd prefer to do it after hearing what someone else has 
found to work :-)

All help greatly appreciated to the tune of free beer on the front porch and 
a electrified parking spot when the contributor visits me in wonderful East 
Tennessee
 :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)

Cheers/Don Carron
