I agree with all the posted help, but everybody missed
one other possibility (besides a tank metal rupture) -
the rubber gasket directly on the top of the tank, you
actually w/out removing the tank, but damaging the
interior sheet metal, can cut a rectangular hole
6&quot;X10&quot; above the tank just about in the middle bahind
your back seat (hey if its an emergency, what the
heck) and then look directly down on the tank gas
gauge sender - if you filled the tank you will see gas
bubbling out - hence it will be coming out on both
sides of the tank as you described , solution : go to
the dealer for a new gasket and replace. The sending
unit is a little tricky to get back in so mark the
original position very clearly before you take a big
screwdriver and dislodge it(it pushes to rt or lt
before it releases). So let me know if that was your
problem.
