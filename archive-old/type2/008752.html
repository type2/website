&gt; I checked the sidewalls of the tires and couldn't find a reference
to a M+S
&gt; rating.  The salesman at Les Schwab told me that they were an all
season
&gt; tire.  I forgot to ask him if they were rated M+S.

Well, he kind of pulled a fast one on you.  Without the M+S rating on
the sidewall, the tires won't be acceptable to the authorities as snow
tires, at least here in California (YMMV).  You might want to take the
tires back to Les Schwab and ask them why their &quot;all season&quot; tires
really aren't all season.  It'd be interesting to see what they say!

&gt; Another oddity that I
&gt; found was that the tires are 4 ply even though they have a C load
rating.  I
&gt; thought C load rated tires were supposed to be 6 ply and D load
rated tires
&gt; were 8 ply.  I just hope that I got the right tires.

You're OK.  What you've run into is the difference between &quot;ply&quot; and
&quot;ply rating&quot;.  

Originally, tires had cotton plys and the number of these plys gave
the relative strength of the tire.  When synthetic fabrics and metals
came into use, the tires could be as strong with fewer plies of
material.

Unfortunately, this led to a marketing delemma for tire manufacturers.
 If they reduced the number of plies by using modern materials the
consumer (for whom &quot;more is better&quot;) would perceive the modern tires
as inferior even if they were actually stronger.

For this reason, the &quot;ply rating&quot; was invented.  The ply rating is
supposedly the number of cotton plies that will give the same strength
as the actual synthetic plies.

Modern tires never have as many plies as their &quot;ply rating&quot; states. 
The 8-ply tires on my bus have two sidewall plies and four tread plies.

Of all the load-carrying ratings on the tire, the only one you should
pay attention to is the actual load-carrying capacity in pounds.  This
is the only rating that you can accurately compare across tire sizes. 
The ply and load range letters will mean different things for
different size tires.  For example, a load range C in 195/75R14
actually has less capacity than a load range B (passenger) in 185R14!

Having fewer, but stronger plies is actually an advantage, as fewer
plies run cooler.  Heat kills tires, and the cooler they run, the
better.
