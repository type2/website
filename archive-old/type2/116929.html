Subject: ACs in early bay westies

Someone mentioned AC units being placed in the sink cabinet in early bay westies.  I haven't seen that, but the AC unit in my 71 was in the jumpseat, 
with an interesting console unit.  I've seen that in another early bay westy.  Made by &quot;Volkswagen Products Corp.&quot;  Intake through a large grille in the 
rear side of the jumpseat box, and IIRC the unit took up most of the jumpseat box.  Condenser (or whatever you call that) was a giant unit under the 
body, with two fans on it.

One pic on this page shows the interior unit: http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/71westy/index.html.  Bus has since been sold but I may be able to 
get my hands on the AC parts if anyone is desperate for them.  (And please state that you are desperate when you p-mail me so I'll know to jack up 
the price. :-)
