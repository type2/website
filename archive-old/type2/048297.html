Subject: [T2] Transvair info (long)

Had a few interested parties contact me for more info on the Transvair, so
what follows is a brief description of what I know so far, and my experience
with this process.

1) Cost: I spent $700 for a rebuilt 110. Price included 3.27 differential
and 4-speed manual transmission, new clutch, throwout bearing, etc. The guy
who rebuilt the engine does this avocationally, and seems to have done a
fine job. This was not a &quot;full&quot; rebuild, rather it included new bearings,
rings, seals, rebuilt carbs, fuel pump, etc. The kit from Clark's Corvair
cost another $500. Plus I had to buy dual exhausts, about $150. Add
miscellaneous things and let's say the whole thing cost me $1,600, or a
little more than a brand new Mexican VW type engine.

2) Difficulty: Not much, really. The main thing with me was retaining the
integrity of the bus -- no VW sheetmetal was harmed during my conversion. I
could pull the 'vair and be running again under VW power in an afternoon if
I so desired. The Clark's kit expects you to cut away the sheetmetal that
forms the sealing line in the bus, but I didn't do that. Instead I tossed
the Corvair tin and fabricated custom pieces that fill the gaps between the
engine and the bus on either side. It's a pretty good seal, but not perfect.
I still need to work on filling some gaps near the engine lid. Other than
that everything is included -- trans mount, linkage adapters for shifter,
clutch and throttle, CV adapters, wiring harness, etc. Quality is pretty
good. There were a few missing pieces and just plain mistakes with the
wiring harness, but overall I am satisfied. The shift linkage runs alongside
the center tube, is ungainly and crude, but works surprisingly well.

3) Parts availability: Corvairs have become collector's cars. I live in
Florida, a relatively kind climate for cars, and I rarely if ever see one on
the road. The fact that most people around here have to have a new Beemer or
SUV every two years has a lot to do with that. But that doesn't mean the
parts are rare. They aren't. Clark's in Mass. has absolutely everything you
could possibly need to keep a Corvair running long into the forseeable
future. I bought some spares (starter, alternator, plugs, wires, belt, etc.)
so I should be set for a while. These I will carry with me, just as I would
VW spares.

4) Longevity: I have been told that the Corvair motor is almost bullet
proof. Several reasons: hydraulic lifters, hardened valve guides and seats,
beefy aluminum block, overbuilt cooling system, short stroke, big honking
main bearings. Richard Finch, author of &quot;How to Keep Your Corvair Alive&quot;
says 200,000 miles out of a Corvair engine is commonplace. Chevy had a lot
to prove with this engine, and they learned their lessons from the best --
VW and Porsche.

5) Philosophy: I struggled with the decision to do this conversion. But in
the end, I went ahead and did it. A conversion is like a child only a parent
could love, and unless you plan to do all your own work I wouldn't recommend
it. As one respondee noted, no mechanic will touch a converted bus. Then
again, I haven't taken my bus to a mechanic in 10 years. I am the mechanic,
and I trust me to make the right decisions. I will now learn all the
idiosyncrasies of the Corvair, and have a damn good time doing it. I will
bask in the glow of the increased horsepower, and if this turns out to have
been a disastrous decision, then I will look back and place the blame
squarely on the idiot who thought it was a good idea in the first place. It
won't be the first time that guy has screwed up. Yes, there are those who
rest safe in the knowledge that the VW factory knew best. And they are
right. But why leave everything up to the trained professionals? I say dive
in with both hands, get a little dirty, learn something while you're at it,
and don't take yourself so damn seriously.

For my next project, I plan to wedge a 427 Hemi into my Ghia... :)
