Subject: Re: [T2] primer/body filler query

Actually Jeff, your right---the fillers are porous and will suck up some
moisture, which will cause problems.
But the biggest reason the stuff fails is improper prep prior to laying
it on the metal.
What happens is the expansion rate of the filler and the metal is
totally different and this is where the problem comes from---and why the
stuff will pop loose from the metal.
This is why it is a good idea to prep the surface of the metal with no
less than 40 or 36 grit paper to give the filler some biters to keep it
from popping off.

And it is a good idea to use the Metal Prep prior to caving and
paving---

I think it is phosphoric acid--which leaves a barrier on the metal to
slow down any further corrosion--
I'll have to go read the bottle, to be sure on this.
