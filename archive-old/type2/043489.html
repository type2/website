Hey Mike,

    Did this a few months ago on my 78 campmobile. Yes, you will have to 
press them out with a press. They come out fairly easy so you may be able to 
make something with a bottle jack and some angle iron. I used just a touch of 
grease when installing the new ones to ease installation and try to keep from 
distorting the new rubber.

Good luck
Waldo
