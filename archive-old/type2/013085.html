Karl...

  Sorry: it's a 68 kombi (with dealer installed?) jalousie windows in the mid section.

  Yes, left rear. The bar is part of the vent wing assembly? So it's not attached to the body... Good to know. Well, in that case, I will probably put in solid glass.

Thanks for your input!

&gt;If it is a bay window, you don't ''cut'' out the bar. The bar is part of the
&gt;vent window. Is this the left rear side window?
