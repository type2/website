Hi all,

This is my first post to the list. So here's my quick intro:
I've just added a previously imported cal. 1970 deluxe microbus to my
collection. :)
I live in the UK, and this will be my 5th acvw in 3 years.


I've got two questions to ask::

I'd like to add a full flow oil filter system to the bus' engine.
How is this possible, with the 68-70 engine mounting brace in place?
(I'm guessing it will obstruct the oil feed from the pump).

And secondly. Is there some form of stolen car register I can check against
in California?
(I'm always a little paranoid about new purchases! I'm sure there's no need
though).

Tia,

Phil Nuttall.
