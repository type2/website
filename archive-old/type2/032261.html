Subject: Solution! Re: low oil pressure at idle
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.02A.9907051457090.29761-100000_at_insci14.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

I have resolved the problem I was having with low oil pressure.  I am
rather sorry to say that the solution had to do with the engine
overheating secondary to the cooling flaps being misadjusted.  When
reassembling the engine, I reinstalled the old thermostat and set it up
according to the bentley's instructions to have the flaps closed when the
thermostat was cool.  As it happens, I should have measured the total
travel of the thermostat, since I would have found it was not sufficient
to allow the flaps to open completely when the thermostat was hot! I have
now reset it such that when the thermostat is hot the flaps are wide open.
Cooling will close them part way, which is far better for not than having
them not open fully.  I would suggest that everyone should set up the
thermostat this way, rather than the book way.  I changed the oil,
believing it may have been damaged by the heat, and I no longer see the
oil light at idle.  I dearly wish this hadn't happened to my nice new
engine, but it still seems to pull fine.  I will do a compression test
when break in is complete which will tell a little about the consequences
of this mishap.  Total distance traveled in this condition was about 50-60
miles of stop and go driving, never more than 12 miles at between cooling
down...so I'd like to believe that it wasn't so  bad...but it might have
been.

Hope this helps someone!  BTW an oil temp gauge might have helped me to
see this problem sooner, even the gene berg solution, for those who have
strong opinions about such things.
