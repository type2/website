Subject: atv lift/engine dropper

hey guys, i just saw an atv lift in my harbor freight paper yesterday for
60 bucks, dunno if it is exactly the same as mine but the pic is similar
and for those who don't know these things are indespensible for dropping an
engine.  i dropped the engine and tranny together all by myself and
installed it all by myself rather easily with it a few weeks ago and mind
you, it was the first time i've ever dropped a t4 and it took me under an
hour in and out.
