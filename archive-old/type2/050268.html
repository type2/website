Subject: [T2] Boneyard in W Ala

I posted about a boneyard east of Tuscaloosa Al a few days ago, and have 
given the phone number to a few who requested. Just for the record, the 
person dealing with the repair shop part of the operation is VERY unhappy 
with how that evolution is going. This is, of course, just one 
experience...but I'd be remiss in not posting it.
