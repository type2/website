Subject: POR 15

Volks,

I went through and read much of what was said in the archives about 
POR15, and just wanted to ask whether anyone has used their new 
bondo-like material, or the seam repair stuff recently.

I just received their latest catalog, and am REALLY intrigued by what I 
see.

When I was in automotive publishing in the 90s, I used to visit these 
guys at the SEMA/AAIW show in Vegas every year...and tried their 
original product on my 73 Eldorado Convertible I restored. Worked GREAT 
on the trunk and fender rust I had.

Now that I have a 69 Westy with more than its share of oxidation, I am 
thinking of using POR15 again.

Thoughts?
