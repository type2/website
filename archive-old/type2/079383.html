Subject: 205s (093) Distributor Installation

I recently came into an almost new 205s vacuum advance dizzy. I am currently 
ressurecting a 76 Transporter (2ltr, solid lifters,009 dist.) I don't like 
the 009 because of the &quot;hesitation blues&quot;...this is esp. noticable cause its 
an automatic... the carburation is a Holly/Webber 2 bbl. ...where on the 
intake manifold do i hook up the vacuum hose?.._dot_can i?
Mahalo much in advance...
