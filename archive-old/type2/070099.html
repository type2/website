Subject: RE: HEAT CAUSE

Ok we have several more candidates:  friction, combustion, compression, and
vituperation, but I'll STILL vote for combustion as the leading source of
engine heat.  And I still think that all the unscorched air compressors
in the world (many of them making air pressures my engine can't match)
are a pretty clear counterexample.  Craig S.'s recent notes defend friction
as a source of heat.  No problem: friction is A source of heat, and thus to
be reduced as much as possible except in brakes.  But you can compress a
bunch of physics majors, all saying &quot;it's the compression&quot; or &quot;it's the
friction&quot;, until they burst into flame (at which point I will be tempted
to cool them off with some gasoline) and I'll still say: it's burning
gasoline that makes my engine hot.  

They had a great event at a recent BugIn:  They took all the oil out of
an old Beetle engine, then they hooked it up to a 24v truck starter and
didn't give it any gas.  They cranked that puppy till she blew.  You didn't
hear about that one?  Neither did I; they always seem to use fuel.

This thread makes me go all Sam Kinison:  You want to know what makes 
something hot?  FIRE!  Fire makes things hot!  Thousands of explosions
per minute will make you warm!
