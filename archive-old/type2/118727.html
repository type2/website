Subject: fuel filter location for carbureted engines

Listees,

This is for a '71 single carb engine. I have recently installed a fuel filter
ahead of the fuel pump. I notice that while the engine is running, the fuel
level inside the filter is right at the bottom all of the time and it appears
that the fuel pump must be sucking a lot of air (or fuel vapor) whenever there
is fuel demand. Here is a photo of the setup and the observed fuel level:

I've checked and double checked that:

  1.. The fuel tank is clean
  2.. The fuel tank strainer is clean and not being blocked.
  3.. The fuel is new and the tank is 2/3 full.
  4.. The fuel pump is new. I measured 6 psi (maybe a bit high).
  5.. The fuel lines are new.
The car runs great so far. It seems to me, however,  that this sucking of air
all of the time (even on cold days) is undesireable and might lead to problems
on hot days, even with a larger fuel filter. Are there any
&quot;filter-before-the-pump&quot; types out there that can comment on this? Does my
filter location/orientation look ok?

Sincere thanks,

Bill Moon
