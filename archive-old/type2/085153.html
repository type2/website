Subject: Re: [T2] good anti-seize goop?

I just use a couple of drops of clean motor oil, and have never had any problems with stuck plugs, etc.

The WAG-AERO catalog, oriented toward light aircraft maintenance and repair, lists a special anti-seize for spark plugs.  [Page 46 in the March 2002 catalog]

&quot;Champion Spark Plug Anti-Seize
A high-temperature lubricant for application during spark plug installation to threads.  Prevents seizing.  Do not apply to shielding barrel threads.  Do not contact electrodes as it could short out the plug.  4oz. bottle w/ brush in cap.  P/N CH2612.  Code 7
Cat. No. K-256-000.......................$5.65&quot;
