Subject: Christmas/Birthday Present Suggestions

My girlfriend has been after me for a while to make up a christmas list and
birthday list (my birthday is just a few weeks before christmas) and I am 
wondering if anyone on the list has purchased any neat VW Bus products lately
or if anyone uses anything in/on/with their bus that was very useful but not
often used.  You see my bus ('77 Westy) is running good right now so I don't
need any thing to get it running, but I am certainlly interest in extras to
make the bus more comfortable.
Anyone use any camping supplies that not completely common?
How about useful uncommon tools?
What about products to make the bus more comfortable to drive in?
How about making the exterior look better?
All price ranges would be helpful.
Thanks for all of your thoughts,
Brett
