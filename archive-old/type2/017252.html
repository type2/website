Subject: Vacuum booster for brakes

1) I've read many times the last several months about a vacuum booster
for the brakes on 76 (?) and later buses. I have the Bentley manual, but
could find no clear reference to where the vacuum is drawn from. I had
the engine out of the vehicle last summer but did not disconnect any
vacuum lines... any help appreciated.
2) A related question about what goes where. My transaxle does not have
a drain plug as suggested in the manual (and numerous posts). Is this a
non-stock unit? [To the best of my knowledge the bus had only two owners
- the most recent owned it for 18 years - it was a family car, so I
don't think much tinkering took place.]

Thanks, Ron J. (ongoing victim of the Pac NW deluge)

'76 stock FI, Doris
