Some of this comes down to personal preference.  WHen coming to a stop
&gt;from highway speed, I'll usually brake down to about 45, then downshift to
3rd (blip the throttle just before you let out the clutch to smooth things
out -- this is where it gets fun.  With practice you can make very smooth
downshifts and impress your friends. ;&gt; ).  I figure this saves wear and
tear on my brakes.  On steep hills in town (Houghton is built on the side
of a hill) I'll downshift into 2nd to avoid having to drag the brakes
quite so much to stay under 30 mph.  Of course, downshifting also comes
in handy when you come into a town and the speed limit drops...when I see
the 'REDUCED SPEED AHEAD / 35 MPH' sign coming up, I take my foot off the
gas and coast...when my speed drops down below 45, into 3rd it goes and
I'm just about down to 35 by the time I hit the speed zone.  Just seems
natural and graceful to me, and keeps the engine in a good RPM range in
case I have to accellerate.  Plus it keeps the cooling fan spinning at a
decent speed, which can't hurt.

As far as cupholders go, I bought some of those ones that hang on the
windowsills.  Then I cut off the hook parts, and screwed them to he sides
of the front seat bases.
