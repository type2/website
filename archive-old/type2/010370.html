That book was given to my father when he purchased a
new Westfalia in 1969. I think it was a common
practice at the time. I read it in the seventh grade
and was fascinated by it. I still have the book.

&gt; 
&gt; For all you die-hards out there. I'm just finishing
&gt; a book called &quot;Small
&gt; Wonder&quot; by Walter Henry Nelson. It documents VW's
&gt; history from DR. Porsche
&gt; and Pre-WWII days until the 60's. LOTS of
&gt; information regarding the design
&gt; and engineering aspects of the VW. &gt; 
&gt; A valuable reference book, for the true VW fanatic.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
