&lt;&lt; On the way to HCBF, my right front wheel errupted in flames.  The brake
 shoes had locked up, heating the wheel to the point that the brake hose
 ruptured, the valve stem melted out, and the rubber boot on the steering
 linkage caught fire.
  &gt;&gt;

this whole bit sounds amazingly familiar to be.   I had a similar experience 
with a brake hose dying in a 59 bus.  Ended up sanding the inside of the 
cylinders round, getting rebuild kits and new shoes.   and of course replaced 
brake hose.  

which is why I repeat how important new brake hoses are.
