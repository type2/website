I have searched the archives and drwan a blank, along with parts catalogues,

The rear of my Right hand chasis keep developing holes, the PO welded a few, I
have welded a few more, the left is OK.  Has any one any thoughts as to the
best course of action with this?

Keep welding? (till the wheel won't go on any more)
Scrap the bus (wouldn't like to really)
Weld on a new part - If so where do I get one, I cant find one in any parts
cat here (UK)
and If I could get a new chassis member isit practical to try and put one on,
ie will the bus lose it's shape if this is removed? 

Any one tried this? Any suggestions? Anything else to look for in archives if
it's been up before?

Thanks
