Subject: Low tech door opening solution?

I couldn't get the driver's side interior door release lever to open the door
on my '71 Westy.  I had to roll the window down and open the door from the
outside handle.  I tore the door opening assembly apart thinking the problem
was either in the release lever or the door lock itself.

After learning the finer points about how the whole assembly works it seems
the problem is really in the length of the rod that runs from the interior
door release lever to the door lock.  By bending that rod a little the
interior relase lever is able to pull the rod back enough to trip the door
lock to open.

Is the solution really that low tech?  I tried shortening the rod for a
neater effect but that made it too short and now my lock doesn't work
properly.  I'll go back to the junkyard tomorrow and grab a replacement rod
of original length, bend it a little, and be happy (not really though because
I'm a perfectionist).
