Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 to late bus conversion tins

hello Ron  Cheap waay to do this is to use a truck inner tube and  screw it 
to both sides. Works very well and doesn't cost very much either.   I have seen 
these pieces made out of shingles, roof flashng and sheet metal and  they all 
worked.  If you want it to look pretty then the European or south  american 
OE tin is best or the fiberglass stuff from Creative Car Craft .   Later  mark 
Dearing
