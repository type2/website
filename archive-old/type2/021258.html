Hi Jeff
at any point did you touch the dipstick with your hand?,, could you hold it?,,
or was it real  hot!
If it wasn't real hot,, and your light was flickering,, maybeeee, you sender
isn't accurate?

Other engine I have experienced overheating,, the engine tin paint bubbles,,
blisters, burns ,, stinks! to some degree,, depending on how hot!

Also you can hear the tin ting and click as it changes shapes while cooling
down. Does you engine tin make noise?

I assume you need to hit a threshold temperature to cause the sender to operate
the lamp, so boiling it won't be much help... as you can only get it up to 212*
F

One other thing I would suggest,, does anyone around you lend / sell / rent an
portable handheld infared temp sensor?
You could buy it,, use it for a few hours,, take it back for a refund,, other
wise beg borrow or steal one,,
they can give you accurate head and sump temps,, and the case temp near the oil
pump exit.
I find that the case temp near the oil pump exit spot is the same temp as the
oil. right in front of the dist.

Do you know what size crank pulley your running?
	a power pulley will spin the fan slower
Do you know that your shroud has the correct fan in it?
	a smaller fan will not move enough air, 
Do you know that the timing is not exceeding 30* at wide open throttle
	more advance than 30 will cause a lot of pinging
Do you know what size jets are in your carb?
	Could be running lean
Do you know what the appearance of your spark plugs are?
	Very tan is an indication of lean and hot
DO YOU KNOW that the engine IS overheating, and not just a inaccurate sender
	feel the dipstick to get a sensation

I like my infared temp gun, other than the pain of poking my head under at every
gas stop. and I can't monitor it from the steering wheel ...

I have measured a few buses this april while carabusing to EveryBus. and they
were all running about 220* -245*....

last year,, some of the same buses,, same engines,,same roads,,warmer ambient
temps, and we were all running about 180*-210*

My unscientific study!  ... I will continue to monitor as many buses as I can to
obtain some data,, 
But it really isn't a lot of help to you,, cause you need an accurate
thermometer to compare


Let us know what you find when you get the solution!
