Beth-
one of the most common problems with tire service
is the guy who torques your wheels with an air hammer.
the easiest way out of this dilemna is to go to almost 
any garage and ask them to loosen your lug nuts , which
they will do for free when you bring your lug wrench and
retighten them by hand. next time watch out for this, or
be sure you can loosen them when you get the bus.
otherwise, you will need an extension ( the 3' foot 
removable handle of a floor jack ) for a breaker bar.

as far as the brake springs go, you can get by nicely with 
a small vise-grip pliers, and keep your redundant tool
collection to a minimum.
