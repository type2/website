Subject: [T2] White Exhaust Smoke

I have a 73 Westy, new AVP motor (1800)with about 2,000 miles on it. Dual
carbs, bought new (not rebuilt) from Bus Depot 3,000 miles ago. I broke this
engine in by the book, had the oil changes and valves done right on time and
I run hi-test gas, per AVP's directions.

I don't drive it much, which is why it has less than 2,000 miles since last
February when the new motor went in. I don't do engine work myself, but I
like and trust my mechanic.

The bus is running beautifully, but I am having a problem with white exhaust
smoke. The smoke appears when I start the bus and the engine is already
warm. Stop at the store, go in, get a couple of things, come back out and
fire her up. Poof, big cloud of white smoke. It doesn't happen when the
motot is cold.

It is doing it when it the weather is really hot (Tucson in the summer) as
well as now.

I am taking her in to get the valves checked this week as a final part of
the break in process on the motor.

I want to take it down to Mexico for the weekend, but I don't know how
serious this is.

What is the verdict, fellow listees?

TIA
