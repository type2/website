Subject: Oil in Starter

Hi Volks

Here's an odd one...

Bus would not start. In fact starter did nothing.
No clicks, nothing.

Pulled the wire off the starter that goes back to the key
switch, hooked up my DVM and had Debby turn the key.
13 volts. Hmm, OK we got juice to the solenoid, the other connections
look ok.... Pulled the started and tried to get it going on the ground
with the battrery charger. Nothing. Dismantled the starter.
It guts were covered in oil, but where did it come from.
First thought was that tranny blew a seal, but the bendix and
outer housing that sticks into the bellhousing are clean !
Also there is NO slipping in the clutch. All is normal.
Now I have never torn apart a starter solenoid,  ...but can it be
that the starter solenoid is full of oil for cooling purposes and dumped
its guts in the starter?

In any case I pulled the starter from my donor bus, and that starters'
braided
wire that goes from the solenoid into the starter was rusted useless
(Vermont
winters...). So tore that one apart, put together the best parts of both
and now have a great working starter.  

Still don't know where the oil came from...
Can someone solve this mystery for me.

Thanks,
Don Martin, Fairfield Vermont
