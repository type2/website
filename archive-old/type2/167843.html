Subject: E10

	A minor fuel retailer Gull. has just staged a media splurge, 
featuring the NZ prime minister, to start selling E10  -  petrol 
containing 10% ethanol.  Gull are branding, imaging &amp; pricing this 
E10 as a superpremium high-octane petrol (which a normal T2 VW 
doesn't need anyhow).
	Among the reactions in the media are vague warnings that this 
fuel can dissolve some fuel pipes, gaskets etc.
	Is there a compilation of N. Amer. experience with E10, which 
I know has been sold for many y?
	The CEO of Gull has stated what I suspect is a red herring  - 
some story of &quot;sour&quot; E10 sold in some other country causing 
&quot;corrosion&quot;.  He says his company has prevented trouble in NZ by 
&quot;sourcing from a company called Octel a top-grade additive&quot; to 
prevent this trouble.  As a chemist I can't make sense of this, but I 
do know that Octel had a history of lying to the NZ govt &amp; public 
about the lead additives they persisted in foisting on us for a 
couple decades, so I wouldn't assume any other petrol additive from 
them was OK.
