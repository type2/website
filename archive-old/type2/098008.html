Subject: timing light modification

hi,

this is indirectly bus-related.

i picked up a battered timing light at a garage sale.
Old Penske.
it doesn't have an inductive clamp. Instead it has an
alligator clip that you are supposed to attach to a
sparkplug &quot;extender&quot; (a springing thing, from looking
at the manual). The extenders are, of course, missing.

is there a simple away to make this work on my bus?
can i buy an inductive pickup and attach it?
can I make a sparkplug extender?
Any guidance appreciated.
