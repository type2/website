Subject: ADMIN Re: [T2] Air Cooled Camping Shirts

You miss the point Jay. Poor Richard is a bus driving listmember who contributes to list quality and sell products.

This guy took our email addresses from here and the AIRS list to make a quick buck, hopefully.

There's a big difference.

NO

&gt;And even if it was delivered directly to the list, could we really &gt;consider it to be &quot;spam&quot;?

It wasn't, and therefore it is.

&gt;tend to think of spam as unwanted mail from porn sites

Or anybody selling anything.

&gt;I am not about to chastize someone for trying to sell me stuff that &gt;interests me regardless of how he obtained my email address...

I think most of us disagree.
