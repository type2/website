Subject: Fan Shroud removal

Hi Volks,

After going through the archive for a while I give up and will just ask straight up.

Can I remove the fan shroud with the engine in place.  If so any suggestions?

Yes I know It's a lot easier to take the engine out.  Did it once BUT without a flat surface its a PITA and it caused me to pull the shaft out of the tran creating a lot of swearing and a shaft that only stays in place because the engine is not letting it go away!!!

I'm gonna have time to do this so even if takes 5 time as long normaly it still might be faster then: pulling engine, putting flaps, removing bell housing, reinstalling shaft, add tranny oil, reinstall engine.  All this on a tottally uneven street!!!

BTW I am doing this to reinstall the flaps taken out by who knows!

Thanks for the help,

Yann
