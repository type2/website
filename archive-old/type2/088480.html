Subject: Fuel leaks!!

A little info, and a question.
When I recently re-painted my bus (back to a bare shell job), I did as many
on the list recommend and replaced all the fuel lines in the bus when I put
it all back together, or so I thought! I have recently been getting strong
fuel smells from the engine bay, and it has taken a while to find the
problem (and quite nerve racking). One joint I over looked in the tank
breather system (2.0L carb '77 bus) that is easily missed is behind the
spare wheel carrier. The steel tubes there are hidden, but there is a joint
there. Make sure you look for this one too!!!!
Another point I'd like to make regarding fires in busses is the electrical
system. I agree with the list when they recommend regularly replacing fuel
lines to minimise the risk of fires, but I also recommend having a well
insulated (and good connection)electrical system. You need two things to
start a fire, one is fuel, the other is an ignition source. If you minimise
the risk of both, you have a much lower chance of a fire starting. With my
recent leak I had raw fuel collecting in the battery tray (luckily not on
the hot engine) on the left side of my bus when I filled the tank, but
LUCKILY it never ignited. I would have taken only on little spark from a bad
terminal and no more bus!

Now for my question. In looking for the fuel leak, I have noticed I
occasionally get fuel leaking from my carbs (std dual solex) when I turn the
engine off (not while it's running). The fuel appears to leak out the main
jet into the throat of the carb, drip on the throttle shaft, weep out and
then drips off the bottom of the throttle shaft. When this occurs, it only
does this for about 5 min. after turning off (a very slow drip). The carbs
have recently been re-build (new bushes on the throttle shaft) and have new
needle and seats (the proper German ball type).
Is this normal?? I have checked the float level a few times as well, and to
the best of my measuring they are in spec. The bus runs fine otherwise
(though it is hard to start when hot, I assume from the leaking fuel).
Should I lower the float level, or is there something else I'm overlooking??

Thanks in advance.
