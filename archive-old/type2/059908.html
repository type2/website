&gt; &gt; &gt; To adjust the position of the steering wheel, change the length of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the tie rods by turning the ends a bit, matching amounts on each side,
&gt; &gt; &gt; turn for turn.  You might want to check toe-in using the Muir method.
&gt; 
&gt; Mark's method works fine for a beetle, but not for a bus, as most
&gt; buses (AFAIK) have an adjustable tie rod only on one side.

George,

I believe your logic makes sense.  But what about the concern that the
steering box is at the mid-point of its range when driving straight
ahead?  Is this critical on a newly rebuilt box, or just on a used box
which may have begun to establish a center wear point?

I think I'll start with a correct toe-in adjustment, adjust the drag
link so the wheel stops are making contact at each extreme and then
adjust the steering wheel accordingly. The turn signal canceller didn't
cancel correctly before or after the steering box replacement, so I
guess I can deal with that when the steering wheel is off.  Another
puller! -- is it a good thing to spend more on tools than parts?

Thanks for the input, DC
