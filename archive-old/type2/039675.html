Subject: Re: Cup Holders in Bus (who cares what it once was!)

I'll thro in my Friday's $.02 werth.

Aisle mounted console w/adjustable cup holders (that'll grow all the way to
take the super tankers), cassette tape holders, waterproof &quot;beverage&quot;
container, change holder, and padded top.

I stop at Tommy's for a greasy chili dog, put the change in the flip-out
change tray, eat my chili dog in between stop lights, pop in a tape, take an
ice cold (I put ice in there to keep 'em cold!) cream soda out of the &quot;ice
chest&quot; between shifting from 2nd to 3rd, pop it open while holding the
steering wheel with the top of my left leg, my left foot pressing on, but
not pushing in, the clutch pedal, traverse the freeway on-ramp with left
pinky (the rest are fondling the chili dog) turning the steering wheel, gulp
gulp gulp, finish chili dog, start brushing my long mane, open the ash tray
to get a couple of &quot;poofies&quot; out, do the left knee co-pilot trick whilst
getting my hair into a pony tail (for all you Yuppies, that's when your hair
is long enough to sit on, you put a &quot;poofie&quot; in your hair to hold it in
place - not white glue). Put my face up to the rearview to check for
extra-length nose hairs (man, they *hurt* when you pull 'em out, don't
they?), call the office on the cell phone... WHAT!! I'm still in 3rd gear?
Man. Too busy doing other stuff. Gotta do the other stuff. Shift to 4th.

Anyway, I reach into the console one last time, and take out my way cool
sunglasses, pop 'em on my schnaz, and we are stylin'. Settle back. Hands at
9:30 and 2:30. Turn up the stereo. Bob a little (just a little) to the
tunes.

Stylin'
