Subject: Re: [T2] oil pressure warning light 

&gt; Are you sure the base hole where the bulb socket goes isn't insulated from
the metal of the cluster?
&gt;

Right you are my friend - thanks - I pulled the bulb holder off of the
signal light and popped it on the oil wire and slipped it in - works
perfectly.  Although the sending unit itself was cooked and is now replaced.

My new problem is shorts.  I replaced my fan fuse and it burnt out again
right away.  The fuse that goes to the idiot lights also burned but ... I'm
hoping that was caused by the signal light wire making contact with
something (I got it working then blew the fuse.)

I also have a silver coloured ring under my glove compartment.  It looks
like it took a jack of some sort.  It had a hot wire going to it.  Any idea
what that would be for.
