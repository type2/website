Thanks to all who replied to my sleeping question, it was a lot of fun to
read the responses.

The most frequent answer was sleeping with head to the front of the bus. 
Next was with the head uphill, whcih usually meant to the front.  There
are a few who like having their head to the rear, especially with the bug
screen snapped in and the hatch open, but watch out for the overhead
cabinet!

Thanks to all,
