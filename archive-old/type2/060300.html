Subject: transvair kit

I have been getting alot of questions about this conversion and what it
takes to accomplish the installation, so I will attempt to answer most of
the questions.

1) Corvairs were built from 1960 to 1969, there were 2 body styles, early
and late (sounds like our buses 
the early corvairs were somewhat smaller and more square, they were built
from 1960 to 1964. the late ones were from 64 to 69. The early engines had
a lower horsepower rating I think it was 80 hp.
 In 1964 through 1969 chevy increased the horsepower by making the
connecting rods longer and enlarging the diameter of the pistons, now the
motor put ouy 110 hp, you could also get a 140 hp motor which has 4 carbs
and a 180 hp turbocharged engine. Both of these the 140 and the turbo are
not what you want to install, because of their slower torque curve, making
the 1965 through 1969 110 engine ideal for the transvair kit.

2)  Also you use the corvair trans and differential for the kit, you can
use a 4 speed or an automatic transmission called a powerglide, this is a 2
speed transmission and it's what I have run for 8 years. One of the reasons
I went this route is because the kit is cheaper for the auto and easier to
install plus there is alot less things that can go wrong, no clutch no
pressure plate, throw out bearing etc. etc.     

3) when I say it just bolts right in I mean it, the only thing you have to
do as far as modifing anything is the engine compartment has to be cut out
square, which is easily done with a sawzall and a metal blade, the front of
the transmission hangs in the same stock location as the V.W. transmission,
the kit has an adaptor that makes this possible. The stock V.W. CV joints
and axles are used and they bolt right up to the corvair differential with
the kits adaptor plates.The rear of the engine hangs with the kits engine
mount which bolts right up to the stock V.W. locations on either side of
the motor. It comes with everthing you need and everything fits perfect,
wire harness and all.
 
Just a few more comments....this motor is bullet proof, it has hydrallic
lifters , dual carbs and your horsepower doubles, when the kit is installed
it looks stock, but runs like a bat out of hell.
One thing I like is that now I never have to adjust the lifters or
re-torque the heads, When it had a V.W. engine I was going through an
engine a year. I have had this set up for 8 years now and the only thing
that I ever had go wrong is I droped a valve seat. Also I dont have to
drive in the slow lane anymore on the freeway I can drive 80 to 90 mph. My
favorite thing to do is spot a bus the same year as mine on the freeway ,
pulling up next to it and then just leave it in the dust...Plus the way the
6 cylinder, dual exhaust sounds, it's  so cool!!!!
 
To do this instalation right you should start out with a re-built engine
and transaxle which could run anywhere from 2,000oo to 3,000.oo depending
on how trick you want it.

The kit costs 600oo dollars and comes with everthing you need including
instructions with good pictures

Corvair parts are not rare they are everywhere and can be picked up at a
good price. The 2 biggest parts suppliers are Clark's corvair in Shelburne,
Mass...1-413-625-9776  the other is The CORVAIR UNDERGROUND in Oregon, dont
have the number, they make everything you could ever need for rebuilding a
corvair engine............well thats it for now If you can send a jpeg to
this list tell me how to do it and I will send you some cool pictures of
mine.............Keith
