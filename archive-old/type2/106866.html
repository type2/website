Subject: RE: no brake lights

Andy,
I wen't snooping in the local bone yard yesterday and they have about fifteen 
busses and I found one bus with a 9 pin E-flasher but they were all on one side 
of the box, looked OG. I wen't there to see if I could find a 12 fuse box, 
found several but couldn't decide on one because of subtle differences that may 
or may not be there and they were about to close and I didn't have enough time 
to study there stuff. Really bugging me!! But sooner or later I'll get it. I'm 
getting a little impatient because I've got this bus just sitting in my 
driveway and everyday it taunts me saying &quot;Drive me, Drive me&quot; and then I 
realize I've got to drive the Pontiac to work.
