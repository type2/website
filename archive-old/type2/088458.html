Subject: Re: [T2] Road Trip -short-

Very nice road trip report! I'm jealous! LOL.. Thank for sharing this! :0)
Yes, where are all the VW buses now? We didn't see a lot of them on the
road, either. Maybe a lot of them have &quot;left town&quot; with Jerry Garcia. Surely
a lot of them followed him on tour.   Jan B
