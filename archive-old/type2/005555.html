&gt; &gt; Has anyone successfully mailed sunroof cables?  I am trying to send them
and

&gt; Uhhhh.
&gt;
&gt; The cable coils nicely into a wee little circle, much like a clutch
&gt; cable...  Just don't kink it..but that requires a good bit of force..

Including the 7 ft  3 inch tracks that the cable goes into and screws it to
the bus..

Peace.
