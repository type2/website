Hi Folks!
I live here in the mid west, and I don't have a heat
problem, because I don't have any heat. When I bough
my van the heater boxer were eliminated to add J
tubes. I have bough small electric heaters including
one this weekend to at least warm up the cabin but no
such luck. Can any one tell me about any one having a
propane used/or new heater system at a reasonable
price? Temperatures here are dropping too (talking
about snow today) Any way I need to stay warm, any
suggestions are appreciated!
Thanks
Alex
