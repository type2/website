Subject: RE: caliper question

&gt;I am in the process of rebuilding my ATE calipers on my 74 Westy.
&gt;The pistons on these have a cutout on them and my question is: 
&gt;how critical is it to put the cut out in the same position?  Do these 
&gt;cutouts serve a specific function?

Yes, these must go back exactly the way they came out.  It's been over a
year since I rebuilt mine on my 73, but I remember the Haynes manual
being very specific about re-alligning them properly.  If they're not
right, that funny metal clip wont fit properly.  You can use the clip to
get the allignment right.  

Remember, your brakes are you life line when you're driving.  If they
die, you die.  Plan on where/how you are going to test them when done
(preferably not coming up to a busy intersection at 45 mph)!!  Then test
them again and again until you are 100 percent certain everything is
right.
