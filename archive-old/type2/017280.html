Subject: Wanted: Battery Charger for '76

Hello Everyone.  The battery charger on my '76 Westy zapped out on me so
I am in the market for a new one.   Or is it possible to have one
rebuilt?    I found  where the wires were crossed and ended up having to
rewire but the charger is definitely fried.  If there is anyone out
there that has one to sell or some good advise please contact me.
Phillip
'76 Westy
