Heading out to the highway I was anticipating the fuel bowls being
recharged with mo betta boosted primate pi**. Bring the throttle up to
induce load to the margin of prior pinking. Still there. Well, it does get
55 mpg. It'll take another mile to flush them carbs out and get on to the
real squawkamole. By the time I got home, some 10 miles, it was apparent
that the Pushed Pee had a marginal effect but the answer lay elsewhere.
Something else was afoot. 

The next morning I set up the compression test. Warm up das maschine.
Trickle charger on the battery for optimum condition. Remove plugs. Remove
carbs for full air flow. Install gauge in cylinder number right.  Hit the
switch while watching the guage rise for several revolutions until it
riseth no more. Note results. Remove guage from cylinder number right and
install in cylinder number left. Hit the switch and note whether needle
rises in a similar fasion to the right hand cylinder numbered over there on
the other side. Note results. Note variations. Note specs.
WOW, factory new at 25,000 miles, and on the high end of the specified
range, no less. OK, JOSE!!!    

Checking the tops of the pistons through the sparkplug holes I saw what had
always looked like a light sprinkling of black powder on the tops of the
pistons. I took a long tiny screwdriver &amp; scooped a dap from the crown. A
light dusting of powder brought out. Hum, not much. Then I looked back at
the piston and could see shiny black, not aluminum, under the divot that I
had extracted. 

Well, I had new head gaskets cuz I knew sooner or later I'd be pulling the
heads for inspection and it might not be exactly when I wanted. So, pull
the valve covers and rockers and pushrods, remove the head pipes, release
the head bolts in two or better stages and pull off the head.  

DEAD DYNOSAURS!!, DEAD DYNOSAURS!!, all over the combustion chambers and
pistons and a goodly portion building up on the backs of the valves, or at
least the atomic carbon equivalant portion of a pound of flesh from a long
dead Dino.

&gt;(to be continued)

&gt;The carbon deposit buildup that one seems are more likely gummy tars from
&gt;longer molecules created in the combustion process.  That's why stuff like
&gt;Marvel Mystery oil is popular...it's a solvent that removes that crap
&gt;(or at
&gt;least claims to).
