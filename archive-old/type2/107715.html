Subject: Any list members near Gray, Maine?

A friend of mine who is brand new to buses is trying to get his '71 Westy
home from Caribou, ME to Dover, NH.  He has been experiencing a severe oil
leak after driving for about 30-45 minutes.  The bus is currently resting in
Gray, Maine until we can make it up there this coming weekend to try to sort
everything out.  If there are any members near Gray that could stop by and
take a look at the bus to help us determine the source of the leak I would
really appreciate it.  Hopefully we can bring some parts with us and fix the
leak before setting out for the rescue.  Let me know and I will get you the
exact address and a phone # of the person who has the bus now.

Thanks in advance,
