Subject: Hints from Heloise - J&amp;J hand lotion

With greasy hands (OK, what's the rest of the line...) I came across a 12 oz 
container of 'pink' Johnson &amp; Johnson hand lotion, sitting next to a pile of 
paper towels.

Squeeze, squeeze some pink cream on hands, and mush, mush the hands together 
and the grease AND DIRT balls right up and wipes right off.

Perhaps not better than WD-40 + dish soap, but definitely smelling nicer and 
feeling softer.

Heck, my hands were so clean I couldn't wait to get home to show the better 
half my soft, clean, delicate hands.

But wait.  First I have to take the CV joints off and replace another 
boot...  &lt;&lt;- Required Bus Content -RBC
