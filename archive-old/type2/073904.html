Subject: Re: [T2] Living out of a Bus....HELP! BUS-A-THON!

John,that sounds like a top idea!
Seeing that on the web would certainly 'cause some
interest and maybe all the people who love to email
about heat to this group could help out on how to keep
our buddy from freezing his extremities off:-)
In fact with his permission we could conduct some
valuable experiments that could benefit everyone.
Heat on a budget....snug in a bus with a rug;-)

&gt; Hi John Here
&gt; I have an idea. Why don't you start a busathon?
&gt; Start by getting some 
&gt; sponsors to pay you per day or per week depending on
&gt; the person. You can also 
&gt; have a buscam so people can check in on your
&gt; expedition. I think its a pretty 
&gt; nutty idea
&gt; to try and live in your bus all winter and I would
&gt; pay to see someone try it. 
&gt; I would start a website refrigerator expedition
&gt; _dot_com, come see someone freeze 
&gt; there nuts off in outback. I think some people would
&gt; rise to the cause to 
&gt; keep you going with
&gt; supplies and donations. We could take bets on how
&gt; long you would last before 
&gt; you turn into a frozen TV dinner.
