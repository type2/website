Hi Beth, these window mounted evaporators were quite the thing in the 40s
and 50s.  Lowriders look forthem now as a cool accessory.  The best thing to
use with them is dry ice.  I have seen someone advertising reproductions of
the old style coolers in the back pages of old truck magazines, or maybe a
vintage lowrider issue.  But I think you should go for it and make your own.
Then tell us all how you did it.

Regards,

Grant
