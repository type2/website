Subject: Heating idea, WTB blower

I have an idea to improve my heating, and as always I will
take opinions.

I read in the archives about a guy who converted his heating
to recirculation and that it really helped. I want to do
this but with a catch. I want to hook up 2 seperate blower
fans, one for each heat exchanger. I will run the 2 sides
into a Y adapter before they go into the heat exchanger.
I found a guy local that will fab the Y for $10 ea. Not
bad condidering I priced the metal _at_ about $4 ea. 

So here is my WTB. I want to buy an extra heater blower
from a type4 motor from some one. 
Anyone, Anyone, Bueler? (mid-80's movie reference)
