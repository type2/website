Subject: Re: [T2] Leak Down Test

Michael: Let me add my two cents here. I bought a leak down tester 
several years ago, and I've used it exactly once.

My understanding is that the first test that should be done is to 
measure compression. If compression is spec on all cylinders, then 
your job is finished.

If it is low on a cylinder, then there are at least three things that 
could lead to this  -  worn rings, leaky head/cylinder/case joint, 
and worn valves. The compression test cannot, by itself, unravel 
these possibilities. The function of a leak-down tester is to do just 
that.  I'm indebted to a previous contributor to the list for the 
following:

One listens as the air is leaking from the cylinder. If an exhaust 
valve is leaking you can hear the hiss of air escaping in the 
tailpipe. Leakage past the intake valves can be heard at the 
carburetor. Bad sealing rings can be detected at the oil-breather or 
dipstick. Pulled head studs or a warped head can be heard between the 
cylinder heads and the cylinders.

So it may be that you can postpone purchase of a LDT until you are 
sure that you have a low compression problem and you want to direct 
your rebuild at the exact source of the problem.

I'm sure open to other opinions on this. I've a lot to learn.

Jack
