Subject: Re: [T2] headrests

&gt; Does anyone have a pair of headrests from an early 70s bus.

How early?  They did not appear until 73....
73 were one-year-only, they have a pushbutton release on each post.
74-75 were soft vinyl with a zipper along the bottom from post to post. Nice
comfortable headrests, but age is getting to them. The material between the
zipper and the vinyl self-destructs over time.
76-79 are hard molded vinyl. The edge that sits in the sun suffers the most.
They crack there if you push on the material.
68-72 seats do not have the supports for the headrests.

I have lots of headrests in almost every color available except black. Black
is very hard to find. The most common soft ones were off-white. The most
common hard bus one is brown [also is in Westies]. The most common hard Westy
one is green. A very tough one to find is the red/brown 78/79 Champagne
Edition.
