&gt;I'm not too sure of this. A pump curve is for most normal pumps &gt;gives us this data: as pressure goes up flow goes down. Which in &gt;effect causes a pump to be able to only pump out a certain volume &gt;at a particular pressure.

A pump curve is to show what a pump can do at varying demands. The pressure requirements of the bus f.i. system are constant, unlike most civil engineering. This pressure is supplied whether at idle or at full engine load, and is maintained by the regulator. The basic pump check is probably a 90% reliable method here.

&gt;If the pump is defective is very well might pump the required &gt;volume w/ no pressure on the pressure side, but fail miserably when &gt;required to pump a volume w/ a pressure. Plus we aren't taking &gt;water pumps here, but fuel pumps.

I see where you're going, but I think in terms of driveway physics, if your pump is putting out the specified volume/time, you can assume it's effective enough for our purposes. Furthermore, I don't believe the type of pump water/fuel really has any bearing. We are talking about a 'fuel' pump pumping 'fuel', so there's no apples/oranges problem here. The physics is uniform.

&gt;I don't like giving anyone advice which essentially says run that &gt;electric fuel pump into a bucket &amp; hope something bad doesn't &gt;happen w/ that liquid bomb.

Nor do I, but nobody says you have to test it under your bus half soaked in gas, smoking a butt, either. Take the pump off, get a fused circuit on a 12v battery in a clean, controlled location.

&gt;No. While replacing fuel lines is a must for any bus you don't know
&gt;the history of, Diagnose then replace is the way to go. All he would
&gt;know is that he has new hoses, while this is a good thing he has no
&gt;idea of the condition of the pump, or any restrictions in the lines
&gt;that he can't replace.

You're contradicting yourself. You say replacing fuel lines is a must for any bus, but perform some verification anyway. Just change the fuel lines! It needs to happen, so do it and see if it solves the problem. You're having logic-block here. We've also (depending on who you agree with here) eliminated the fuel pump, and with the lines all off, there shouldn't be any &quot;you can't replace&quot; and the metal ones can be visually inspected.

Buying a 30.00-50.00 pressure gauge to test fuel lines you should replace anyway doesn't make sense as a starting point. Fuel lines are maintenance items, requiring replacement by nature. Perform this ritual before buying instruments.
