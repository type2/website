Subject: Re: [T2] Purchasing bus internationally

John,

$4,000 seems like a lot.  Do you really like the bus that much?

Seems like that $4,000 you could get one from Europe someplace.
If I remember correctly, you wanted RHD rather than U.S. style.

For $4,000 you could buy a bus here and then a RHD front beam from the
UK someplace and make the bus a RHD vehicle.

Last of all, if you are certain that you want to *really* do the shipping 
thing, you need an agent/broker that will arange everything....someone who 
does this sort of thing for a living and knows all of the ins and outs of 
doing it correctly.

I have a personal friend that does this sort of thing for a living...pmail 
me if you are really serious.....because it is *not* cheap.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Greetings volks,
&gt;       I'm looking at purchasing a bus from South Africa. So far, the 
&gt; seller looks legit (I've gotten a lot of warnings about SA scams). I've 
&gt; got a question for those of you who have purchased a bus and had it 
&gt; imported into the states. I asked the seller if he was willing to use an 
&gt; escrow service. He said he prefers using an &quot;International Letter of 
&gt; Credit&quot; and that this would give me sufficient protections against 
&gt; damage or fraud.
&gt;       Can anybody explain to me what this means exactly? Anybody done this?
&gt;       Second--I've been quoted $4,000 US for shipping from South Africa 
&gt; to the east coast of the United States. This seems high. Has anybody 
&gt; ever shipped a bus from South Africa, and if so how and how much? I 
&gt;       Can anybody recommend some companies to use for shipping?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again for all of your time and wisdom,
&gt; John Tracy
