&gt; How many of us ran out to our trusty late bay and pulled a front turn 
&gt; signal/marker len, and then saw the 12V 4W bulb (or hole where the 12V 4W 
&gt; bulb use to be).

I surely did

&gt; But how many of those of us who did not believe then ran a continuity check 
&gt; to be assured that the bulb was indeed burned out.

no bulb but a cute little place to put one
&gt; 
&gt; And, then ran to the local auto parts store to buy a set of Sylvania 12V 4W 
&gt; 3893 bulbs _at_ $2.19 a pair??

not yet.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I also got a pair of those amber turn signal bulbs, and now going out 
&gt; on EBay to find a pair of clear front marker lenses so that I can make use 
&gt; of all the bulbs.

I got the amber turn signal bulbs but where do you find a clear lense++

of that *_at_&amp;^%*&quot;&lt;*&amp;&gt; intermittent miss....
