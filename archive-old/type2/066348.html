Subject: Cv question

Ok
So I pull my drive shaft, remove the cv joints and clean.
I was careful not to mix the balls between cvs. I was looking
at the innermost part of my cv's and there is some minor
pitting. Should I be worried about this? The only reason
I pulled them was to replace the boots, they were not
giving me any trouble.
Also, Does it matter which way the outermost circle deal,
( the part the the bolts run through for attatchment)
goes? It appears that it can go either way but I would
like some advice on that.

I appreciate the several responses I got on my servo hunt
problem. I found one local, used for  ~$80. However, the
guy who owns the place said my problem sounded more like 
a bad check valve as opposed to the servo. Price used ~$10.
I sure hope he is right. I know Mr. Dolan, if I had
a vaccum guage I could check the servo pretty easy. :)
Anyway I hope to pick it up tommarrow to and see if that
is my problem.

I met listmember Jon Christianson this weekend. Very nice guy
with lots of VW knowlege. His sigle cab Zorm is pretty cool
as well. He is the first list member I have met so far,
but hopefully not the last.:)
