Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarket Fuse Boxes -70

&lt;anyone know of a source of aftermarket fuse boxes for our
buses&gt;

Direct plug in? No. 

Good aftermarket solution? Go to the grocery store and find a copy of the Street Rodder, Street Scene, etc. magazine. You'll have alot of fitting and cutting to do but I've used an aftermarket fuse panel in a street rod with excellent results. 

Alternative: Napa has generic blade type fuse boxes. Advance Auto had the same 6 circuit panel for 50% less and it appeared to be the same manufacturer. This was 2 years ago. You might be able to get a larger than 6 circuit panel. 

Alternative: RV catalogs or Marine catalogs. 

Document your alteration so you can explain it to the next owner though... &lt;grin!&gt;
