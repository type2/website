Since  it's Friday.... my buddy's son Michael has an early 90s Honda with
&gt;  around 
&gt; 300,000 miles on the odo.  Runs OK then quits.... and  Michael has not found
&gt; the 
&gt; cause.  
&gt; 
&gt; a)  Anyone know why a distributor for early 90s Honda would cost 300-400  
bucks?
&gt; Is it somehow integrated with the ignition coil, or the  computer system??
&gt; 
&gt; b) We all know there are any number of ways  a 300,000 mile car can fail.  
The
&gt; distributor was the guess of  one tech.  Anyone on this list with 
aging-Honda
&gt;  experience?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanx,  Glenn, Queenstown,  Maryland




hey Guys   The  early 90 hondas did have dizzy problems and  reman ones are 
out there. There is also a main relay up under the dash behind  the steering 
wheel that fails a lot. PITA to get to normally a blue box.   Later  Mark
