&gt;At what temperature does oil really start lubricating properly? Let's say a
&gt;20-50, perhaps a Castrol GTX brand.

I've seen 170F in print as a minimum operating temperature.  I have always 
used that as a rule of thumb for when I can start going deep into the 
throttle.  HP Books &quot;How to HotRod your VW Engine&quot;, which is a good book 
despite the name.  Keep an open mind and check this book out if you run 
across it - you won't be disappointed.
