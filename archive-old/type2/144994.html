Subject: Re: Fuel pumps and flaps and exhaust OH MY!

Hey Don,

           I'm just curious. How necessary is it for someone living in South Florida to use the thermostat? When I bought my Bus, the engine tin had been put together, but the large flap (the one that people typically remove) was missing. I bought the flap kit from Busted Bus and installed it... (turns out my engine might have been overheating and I didn't even know it). I still don't have a thermostat assembly, but I'm wondering how important it would be for me to actually own one. 

I don't drive my Bus all that often, and when I do, I always allow it to warm up first... (I'll usually wait 5 minutes before I start driving it).

Any idea?


Thanks!

Todd
