Subject: Re: [T2] Why retrofit a smaller oil pump in a dual port ? (aka
  PO rant)

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;&lt; Arnaud &gt;&quot;


&gt; I found a flat camshaft and an oil pump with 21mm gears in the AE
&gt; (seems original) case of my dual port type 1 engine - that is for a
&gt; 1971 bus.

Well,, If you have a flat camshaft , you need to replace it anyway... no 
questions asked... did it go flat from not enough oil? ,, maybe your 
bearings are toast too... best have a look inside.


&gt; What a pain ! Why would some random &quot;mechanic&quot; retrofit a flat cam and
&gt; smaller oil pump in MY bus ?

Many time people use what they have on hand... spare parts lying around will 
do.. until they get it all back together and find out it doesn't work ....
Parts are sooo mixed - matched on aircooled VW's



&gt; . My bus has been getting unusually hot
&gt; oil even though the heads seem cool. It could well be that getting the
&gt; right oil pump (stock) could fix that.

If your bearings are starving for oil ,, they would get hot, I am sure,, but 
wouldn't a simple oil pressure gauge tell you if the pressure is low... in 
fact , the dash light would tell you that the oil pressure is low,, and 
there fore the volume of oil the pump can push may be inadequate, and you 
need a larger pump.

Is you oil pressure dash light working,, does it flicker,, or come on at 
idle?
