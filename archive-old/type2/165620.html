&gt; My dash has a small tach on it, I assume this is not original.

There were tachs, but if it isn't a close match for the speedometer it is
aftermarket.

&gt; There is a small light next to the levers on the dashboard. It is just a
&gt; bare bulb, the cover for it is missing. I'm not sure if it is original, nor
&gt; do I know what it is supposed to do.

That is probably the brake warning light, which lights up if there is an
imbalance in the brake system.  It normally has a red lens.

&gt; The levers on the dash, I believe the two on the right are for fresh air
&gt; vents. It seems like these are unable to go completely off. The other two
&gt; levers are for heat, right? I can move these, but what is the difference
&gt; between them.  One of them seems spring loaded, whenever I move it it
&gt; springs back.

Different years work differently.  The heat levers work the left and right
heat exchangers.  I work mine together.

If air is leaking through the vents even when off, the seals in the air
door (behind the grille) are probably shot.

&gt; Also the PO apparently got the whole dash covered in a light mist of paint.
&gt; I think he just didn't mask it correctly. I would like to clean it off. I
&gt; was going to try to use goof-off or something like that

Be careful.  Goof-off will probably attack the dash better than it attacks
paint!  Test on a small unseen spot and wait a couple of days to see if
the solvent has a long-term effect.

&gt; Last question this round.did the dash have a speaker mounted under it, and
&gt; if so how was it attached?

There was an oval speaker under the center of the dash screwed down from
above.
