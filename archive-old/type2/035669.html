&gt;Hmmm...
&gt;
&gt;I never feel comfortable getting underneath a car unless I have at least
one
&gt;tire chocked.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
I sliced some 4X4 timbers at a 45 degree angle and connected the two with a
rope to make some free chocks.  Just like those at the airport!.  Keep them
in the back in case I have to change the tire.  I've read too often about
folks getting crushed.
