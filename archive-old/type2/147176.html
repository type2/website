Subject: Re: [T2] Modern day CD player into our Bay windows?? - Now
  Speakers

Hey folks, now that I've gotten that question answered, I'd like to ask
about speaker placement. In my earlier Westies that weren't in such nice
shape, I'd just hacked the door panels and put in small round speakers in
the footwell area. This Westie is much too nice to cut up, so I'm wondering
if anyone has gotten creative with speakers without ruining the body? Any
thoughts on where they could go?

 

Courtney

I hung the rear of the Sony CD/MP3/radio unit from the stock radio

speaker grill holes on top of the dash, using a small bolt. Can't

remember if I had to use hardware pipe hanger strapping (it has holes

all along it). Easier to use a wing nut held underneath as you hold the

bolthead above.

One thing, tried to mount the rear support for the unit onto the rear

of the ashtray. Spent hours getting it to fit &amp; then found that it was

a real pain to remove/refit the unit so left it off. Haven't had any

trouble in 12,000 km.
