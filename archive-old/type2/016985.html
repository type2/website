&gt; Hi everybody,
&gt;  I have the complete wiring diagram for my 77 westy but it does not cover
&gt; the things the westfalia conversion added on.  Do any of you guys where I
&gt; can get this information.  In particular, I am trying to find out what this
&gt; relay connected to the left side of the engine bay does (it is mounted just
&gt; to the left of the top left side of the deck lid).  Of the things that plug
&gt; into this, one is a ground to the coach battery and I'm not sure what all
&gt; the other posts do.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

That's the auxilary battery charging relay.  One terminal goes to the
alternator output (the wire that goes to one side of the altenator
light), one to the aux battery positive, one to the main battery
positive.  The line to the alternator has to go on the &quot;coil&quot;, which
will close in the relay, allowing the aux battery to charge when the
alternator is up to voltage.  The other two shouldn't matter which is
which.  Try a jumper to each of the three terminals.  The one that makes
it click is the coil. (when the relay case is grounded.)

HTH.. :&lt;)
