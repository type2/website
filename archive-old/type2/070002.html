Subject: What's best? Nostalgia

I've an 83 Vanagaon now for two months and I'm hooked.  I started in with '66
split window Kombi in '69 that I bought for $600 with 25,000 miles on it. Since
then I've had a '64, several other '66's, a '71 and a '69 (which  I still have)
I've spent years using these things for living accomodations for months (and
years) at a time.  If I were to find myself vanless (as I have from time to
time)  I would be looking at every vw van on the road as if someone had taken my
home.  But for all the nostalgia, none of those fine vehicles comes even close
to the Vanagon for comfort, driveability, quality of construction, space, etc.  

Given all that...for pure aesthetic bus-ness..splits (which we used to call
lightweights) rule! Though I am coming to love to newer look...John Jensen in
Annapolis
