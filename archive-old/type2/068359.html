&gt; This question is for all of you who use air tools.  What tools to do find

&gt; an impact wrench or a rachet.  What else is there?
&gt; And yes, I have a compressor and tank that should be able to run most air
&gt; tools, I just have no tools yet.

I love my 3/8 air drill.  It makes a really cool sound.  8-)  But
functionally it also is great for drilling out multiple spot welds and
rivets like when I installed a new roof on my 59 Panel.
