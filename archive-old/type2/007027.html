In this matter I think that my dear departed Grandpa Sam said it best,
believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see...

I would venture that there is more and less to both side of this issue. 
Personally, I have never had a problem with people.  I could be just lucky
or maybe its because of how I approach situations.

Cheers!

  Friends,
  Without wishing to open another can of worms before Friday, maybe we
should 
  all reflect on how it might have come to pass that the campground owner
was 
  moved to pull a revolver on one of our clan. It brought back to mind an 
  incident I had in Washington state where a far off-the-road campsite owner

  was very reluctant to rent to us because no more than 5 minutes earlier he

  had angrily thrown out a VW van load of 'hippies&quot; who had arrived late the

  night before, stayed, and then claimed inability to pay for their site. 
  Maybe we need to be aware of the possibility that we are &quot;marked&quot; by some 
  business people who come in contact with all the various kinds who are
part 
  of our clan, and so we get stereotyped unfairly.
