Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator??  And Bus is running!!

When this bus was last running did the charging system work?
If so I would double check the hookups.
The wires at the regulator are easy to mix up in that dark corner.
One goes to the dash light and the other goes into the alternator harness.
One is blue and one is black.
Easy mistake to make.
Nothing sucks like putting a new $200 part in and having the same problem
you started with.
Good luck

&gt; If you've got a '78, then you've got an alternator, not a generator.
&gt; I just replaced the alternator on my '78.  Easy job, just takes a
&gt; little time.  Also helps to have the rear wheels up on ramp.  Both the
&gt; Bentley and the Compleat Idiot can get you through the process.  If
&gt; you've never done it, read the instructions and then let me know if you
&gt; have any questions.  As for test the alternator, first make sure the
&gt; belt is taut and not slipping, although I'm sure you would have it.
&gt; Also, check to make sure the alternator is properly secured.  The
&gt; brackets for the alternator have a tendency to fail.  As for a new
&gt; alternator, you can't beat a new Bosch with the roadside assistance
&gt; guarantee, or Poorman's triple A.
