Subject: Stuttering and Cutting Back

ok me and a friend got the new brake servo and master cylinder on.....
plus he rebuilt the carb for me and also we blead the brakes...

its been a very long day./....
well we forgot to hook up the brake booster hose very simple thing to overlook....

he adjusted the timing and such and was running good...and strong... stronger than i have ever seen her run... was moveing up the hills around the neighborhood....

well shortly after he left she started this stutering thing when you go to take off in her she stutters and you have to give her some gas  and finally she goes/....

well i pulled over and thats when i found the brake booster hose loose..

i went back to the house and fixed it up and crunk her up again and revvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvved really high and shut her off.......
she was really high in rpm's././.
...
i tried again and this time i hit the accelerator.....
the rpm's dropped and she quieted down and i thought she would behave AND THEN SHE shook cuting off....
if you give her gas she will stay running but idles back down...?

ok can this all be the cause of the brake booster hose...?
maybe so ...
1. she was doing the stuttering thing before hand but yet not the first and best test run.....
seemed only after she got really good and hot did she start acting up bad...

2. after i hooked up the brake booster hose she wouldnt stay running at all hardly by herself and if so not for long...

ok can the adjustment be off and be the cause of all the stuttering that she is doing...????????
she kept wanting cut off at the red light also and i held the park brake and tapped the gas to keep her awake...

so close now so close and yet high country is next weekend...
hope all this tired blabber makes any since...
been a long day...
going to hit the shower and find a pillow,...
peace you all...
