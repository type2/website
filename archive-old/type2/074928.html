Subject: Re: [T2] Mysterious Post-Ignition Sounds

Sounds like the shaft the bendix gear rides on is gummy. remove the starter,
clean the shaft and re-lube with a light coat of good grease and then
re-install. That's what fixed the same problem for me.

Subject: [T2] Mysterious Post-Ignition Sounds


&gt; Hi All -
&gt; Here's a good one, I hope:  When I start up my 79 fuel-injected bus, I get
a
&gt; strange sound immediately after my engine starts -- that is, as soon as
the
&gt; engine catches, I hear this whirring/grinding sound (best description I
can
&gt; muster) from the engine compartment that continues for approximately 2
&gt; seconds after ignition.  My initial thought is that it almost sounds as if
&gt; the starter keeps going briefly even though the engine has already
started.
&gt; This doesn't happen every time however -- I haven't yet been able to gauge
&gt; any consistency, but it seems as if this happens more during the first
(i.e.
&gt; coldest) starts of the day rather than the warmest.  Do these symptoms
sound
&gt; familiar to anybody?  Thanks!
&gt;
