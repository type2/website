Subject: Heat!!! installed new B1L compact

Dear All,

I got fed up without hear and non of the recommendations on the list 
have convinced me so I have bought and installed a new Espar 
B1Lcompact heater that runs off petrl and works extremely well.
If you are interested in the details I will put some pics of the 
installation and setup together and put them on the web.
Only if there is some demand though.
