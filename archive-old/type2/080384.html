Dear All.

I bought a pair of these ventilation fans complete with steel covers, three 
years ago, at a local VW Show, in Essex, Great Britain, for a total of £10 
(i.e. about US$14). They were from an early model 1968~79 VW Type 2; having 
steel rather than plastic shrouding.

I suspect they are even rarer over here!

Regards.

You said:-

&gt;Fans are out of a 74 Canadian Deluxe Westy....covers are the Lime Green 
&gt;from
&gt;that year, but can be repainted to suite your interior easily...or use your
&gt;existing covers, and drill a 1/2&quot; hole for the wire and grommet using this
&gt;cover as a template...have seen these go for over $200 on ebay...they're
&gt;pretty rare to find in working order...
