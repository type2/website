&gt;Can you tell us more about your oil cooler fan solution Jake?  I don't know
&gt;the setup but it sounds &quot;cool&quot;.  Are sodium valves still available and if so
&gt;are they advisable?

Sodium valves are patchily available.  A lot of guys swear they are old tech
and not worth using, and I'm even talking like Bob Donalds here.  BUT you
know something VW was still putting sodium valves in '91 WATERBOXERS,
so you be the judge.  I got a deal ($26 each) on some for the 1.7/2.0 bus from
GPR a few years back and I think some others did as well, but recently when
I called they were NLA (from them at least.)  Automotion still lists them for
the 1700 and 2.0 914 I think but they are pricey (and always were from them
$60 each or so.)  I recall Bob Hoover tracking down a set to use in a T4 he
was doing FWIW.  The 1800 should be the same valve as the waterboxer
incidently I guess, but I think those were NLA from the dealer as of about
5 years ago.  Regardless I don't think they are past technology I think they
are just expensive and hard to find, a lot of racer types still run them
regularly.  An interesting tidbit here is that a NOS set of 1700 heads I
bought off of ebay came with sodium valves that don't have the little hole.
I don't KNOW they are sodium but they are VW valves, the guy claimed he
paid more in the day for them and had a pcopy of the VW parts list that
showed them to be so and the PN was correct (a one of a kind PN BTW.)
I've meant to x-ray em someday to find out if they are or aren't.  Those
I'm saving for the eventual rebuild day of the '77 long in the future cause
they are real VW heads with real VW guides and all real VW valves.

&gt;What were the AVP and MSHP &quot;fixes&quot;?

AVP increases the interference and I think uses a wider seat, as does
Bob Donalds.  Wider seat more contact area, less stress, less chance
of pounding in.  Plus when you pop out the old seat if they don't need
welding a wider seat lets em just machine the new hole and put the seat
in without more work.  More interference, better fit.  MSHP did the same and
swaged them in.  MSHP work was pretty crappy in the end, but the seat
work always seemed solid enough.  Bob uses some &quot;special&quot; seats likely
just a diesel seat or something as well, they all probably do.  None of
these guys do anything approaching what the factory did to install them,
most just bang em on in with a mandrel.  FWIW Rimco does the seats
for FAT and has an exceptional reputation, I don't know if they will do them
for just anyone or not.  Personally I don't think the mechanical idea of
swaging is all that keen, plasticly deforming metal to avoid the real issue
(heat) isn't a long term solution, just a fix for a while.  My experience with
any swaged thing I ever saw on car or rocket motor has been someday it
will bight you in the rear.  And yeah I just peen some of the oil plugs in the
T4 case instead of threading them so I fall into it as well.

Solution, cooler engine.  I just installed a 72 plate kit in the '82 auto
which
notoriously was running hot, would get to 250F to drive 55-60 in the summer
and over it on hills if I don't watch.  Now like I've said the auto is hell on
cooling in the Vanagon cause you build up all that heat up a hill then
crest the hill and let off the throttle and the engine revs drop to nothing
and no cooling.  Anyway with the cooler installed I stay solidly in the
210-220F range, which is right where I want to be.  Now this being oil
temp still doesn't change how hot the heads may be getting under load,
but with all that oil splashing around the rocker box and scrubbing heat
back into the sump and to the cooler it sure helps.  I mean Porsche has
basically built &quot;oil cooled&quot; engines for years, obviously pushing the bounds
of CR and forced induction.  The install in the Vanagon is real swift BTW as
I laid the cooler in the rear left corner in front of the drivers side
tailight.
It fits PERFECTLY laying flat in that location, I cut out a 6&quot; x 9&quot; or so
hole in the floor of that area so that ram effect from the scoops shoves
air though the cooler.  I'm looking for a cheap fan to mount on the thing
as at the moment when you stop moving it stops cooling but for highway
runs I can now drive 65-70 and not budge above 220F.  I just used the
cheapo adapter plate.  I'm probably going to spring for a Neuspeed plate
with integral thermostat before winter instead of using a kludgy external
one but the external is $30 from Jegs and the Neuspeed was $110 5 years
ago when I looked so we'll see.  Maybe I'll just take the thing off in the
winter or run 10W30 oil.
