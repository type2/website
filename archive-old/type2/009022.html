Listees,

Since my brother is off of the list for now (in the process of moving), I
told him that I would pose his question to the list.

Tim has a 79 Westy and is having problems getting his sink pump to run. 
This is a brand new pump and he knows it works because he has hooked it to
a battery.  When he hooks it up, won't run.  Time to get out the trusty
mulimeter.  Tests the wires, getting only 6 volts.  Tests the trusty volt
meter, yup, still trusty.  Now, time to test the list.  Anybody have any
idea what would be causing this?  One additional thing is he does not have
the auxiliary battery hooked up at the current time.  Don't know if this
would affect anything but if it does the mighty list will tell me.

Thanks,
Ed Woenker
74 Westy
