Subject: RE: [T2] stereo

Kevin says::

&quot;Any advice on a good place to buy a CD player for my dash.  I know  the 
size is odd but I'm sure somebody makes them.&quot;

Kevin, may I ask how you are sure someone makes them??  I mean, a CD player 
for your dash..

I guess it is just a CD deck which you are asking about, right??  Not an 
AM/FM radio receiver/CD deck.

I would be interested if you did find a radio AM/FM receiver with a CD 
player which fit the VW bay opening without modifications to the opening.

Te opening is very unique, and the best bet would be to get an original 
radio blockoff plate from 'casting fool' and cut that to fit your audio 
item.

Good luck and let's hear where you got your assurance that the audio device 
you are refering to is being made...
