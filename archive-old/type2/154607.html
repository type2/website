&gt; Hey Ron   I have done a bunch of these and they are a real PITA
&gt; I have been using S&amp;S headers for the last couple of years and
&gt; they fit really well and seem to hold up very good  later  Mark Dearing


Funny, I get more complaints about the S&amp;S being difficult to line up than I
do with the stock exhaust. I don't know if that's because of actual QC
issues, or because when a part doesn't line up right, people are especially
prone to blame the new part instead of the old one they're bolting it to if
that new part is aftermarket.
