Hi,

&gt;     ...Hmmm. Playing the odds, that would make a '71 (last 
&gt; year with up-
&gt; right engine, but with discs), the best choice for economy ...

 Yes, that's the accepted wisdom on the list (assuming that you're
only talking about the North American market).
 In the unlikely event that all other things are equal, a '71 or
a '78 are the &quot;best&quot; years: '71 for least cost '78 for more power
and minimal maintenance (but no 1-Y-O exhaust parts).

 It's also generally acknowledged that this shouldn't be taken too 
far: there are only so many '71s about and while a good one is a
nice find, it's not worth passing over a tidy '68-'70 for.
 Also, If the '71 needs work, a clean '72-'79 may be cheaper.

 My experience in the UK ties up with the $5000 figure, if you
factor in the higher cost of motoring here. the numbers are a
little different but the principle, equations and relative figures
line up. The only real difference is that we had eight years of
&quot;71&quot; busses, so the nominal best buy in the UK would be a '76-'79
with a 1600cc and an 091 gearbox (or a shiny new Brazilian bus,
if you have enough front money and can live with LHD).

Cheers,
	W.
