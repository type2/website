Subject: [T2] *Wolfsden Imports* What Happened...

Anybody know what happened to one of the *goodguys*
in VW parts, Wolfsden Imports in Poulsboro
Washington?

After many emails, I called their toll free number:
(888) 428-1797, and the business number: (360)
598-4813, but both have been disconnected. I have an
order placed with them for some time now, but ...

Sure would like to know what happened to them, and
to my money, of course.
