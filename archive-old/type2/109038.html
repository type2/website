Subject: 72 Westy Fuel Pump Rod problems - Solved!

It was the rod not being able to return back to the cam lobe.
I took the rod, put it in the drill and took a piece of 600 grit wet/dry
a minute later it's a nice smooth fit.
Looking inside the case it looks like they put a bronze bushing in there
Hard to tell now that the motor is in.

Then, in putting it back in I put the gaskets backwards causing a fabulous oil
leak.
Flipped the gaskets around, and now all is well.

I had just enough time to make sure it started.
Later today I'll time it and bring it down to the shop that sold me the motor
they'll check everything out and issue the 6 month warranty

Thanks for the help !
