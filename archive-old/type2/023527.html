Yesterday I removed the fuel tank from my 78 Westy.  Around the area where
the 2 nipples for the fuel injection lines to attach there is rust,
approximate 2-3 inches diameter.  There is also a fuel leak around that
area.  In addition it is apparent someone tried to solder/weld this area
before.  The rest of the tank looks good except it does need cleaning out.
Advise I need, just chuck the old tank and get a new one or have this one
repaired?
