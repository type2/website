well being of the &quot;take only the engine out&quot; school I don''t usually take

slot, so unless I pull the tranny rearward or unbolt the plate the tranny
isn't going anywhere.  not sure about the manual tranny mounts

&gt; &gt; If you find that you have to support the tranny on your Type 
&gt; &gt; 4 Bus, you have
&gt; &gt; a serious problem somewhere.  On the Type 4, the tranny is 
&gt; &gt; hung from the
&gt; &gt; chassis at the rear by two big bolts.  No tranny support is 
&gt; &gt; needed, and the
&gt; &gt; transmission does not move when you remove the engine.
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; It's not the rear of the tranny that needs support, it's the 
&gt; front (so says Bentley anyway.) My theory was that the engine
&gt; and bearer (and the 2 big bolts) held the tranny in place (and
&gt; correctly aligned) while the engine is in, and removing the 
&gt; engine puts more of the weight of the tranny on the front mount, 
&gt; which may not be designed for that much pressure? 
&gt; 
&gt; I was just following Bentley's recommendation.  I'd love to skip
&gt; that step if it's not needed.  I'm a T2 novice so when I read the
&gt; &quot;make sure to support the front of the tranny&quot; part in Bentley, at
&gt; first I thought &quot;I never had to do this with a Beetle&quot; but then I had
&gt; had visions of my tranny dropping and breaking on the concrete floor
&gt; so I just went along with what the book said.
