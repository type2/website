Subject: Re: [T2] My bus is tired

&lt;&lt;  I am  getting 
depressed because  I strive to take good care of my bus and am under the 
impression that lots of you guys are able to use your busses for daily 
transport, not just shows and stuff.  I will be heartbroken if I have to 
take it off the road; I know in my gut that I will not have to , I guess 
I just need a little emotional support.  Thanks in advance, Beth in NJ &gt;&gt;

Left field guess: Check your brakes, especially the rears. If the hand brake
doesn't release completely, it can drag causing the symptoms you describe.
