Subject: Propane Problems (busted by the fire marshal)

Hi everyone,
Well just got a call from the college campus fire marshal where I work,
seems I have to take my propane tank off my roof rack.  It powers my gas
heater.  It was on the roof because a cop busted me and said it can not be
stored in a vehicle.

The law (as it is in SC)
Cannot store a tank within 50ft of a building (didn't do that)
cannot be in a crowded area.  (It was in a parking lot)

The fire marshal said he looked around in the codes but couldn't get around
it.

Guess the tank is going back in the bus (hidden) after a week or so of
cooling off time.   shhhh...

Time to freeze again...

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
