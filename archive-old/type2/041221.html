Subject: Replaced main wiring loom

Hello everyone,

Thank's, to Suzanne R., Dave W, and Steven D, ( May 23,&amp; 24th.) .... for
your kind posting.  I was able to complete the wiring harness replacement on
the 70 Westy ( that had the fire in the engine compartment) without a snag.

In the process I just kept remembering the words of encouragement from Dave
W,  *piece o' cake here* and *yank that ole' harness from the front* though
we ended up yanking it from the rear instead.  Used a piece of very strong
cotton fishing line to pull the new loom through.  Also, had to replace the
wiring part of the ignition switch, since the wire to the coil had fried it
as well.  I was amazed at how easy this project turned out to be.....

Thanks Again to you all,

Bob
71 Westy *The Free Bus*
