Subject: Re: [T2] ford relay?

Your right Paul,

A relay is a relay--no doubt--

But what do you get in a Junkyard--Junk--

And Junk is still junk--

Relays are cheap--why go to the trouble of groaping around in a salvage
yard for who knows what?--

Buy New.

Be Happy.

Later,

Terry

a relay is a relay, you only need the rating to handle whatever power
your pumping through it other than that it doesn't really matter who
makes it. I'd personally just go to the junkyard and get a few dozen to
keep on hand for spares for about 25 cents a piece.
