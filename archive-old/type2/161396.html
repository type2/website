I am going to try driving it all morning, upgrade my gas and see how I
do.  Otherwise will retune or go historic but would rather not.  Thanks
for all the help!

Patrick

&gt; Patrick,
&gt;          Are you aware of Maryland's 'Historic' plate category?  Your
&gt; 79 vehicle is 25+ years old and should qualify.  You would not be
&gt; subject to emissions testing, IIRC.

limited to 5,000 miles a year.

&gt; Some years ago you gave me several VW parts (maybe a Bay windshield).

&gt; If you need to borrow one, I have a 1970s era emissions tester,
&gt; proctologist style. Have not used it lately but it was working when
&gt; put up on the shelf.  I am across the Bay Bridge from you.

if he doesn''t want it I sure would love to be able to tune in my
air/fuel mix
