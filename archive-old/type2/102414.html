Subject: Re:Important cooling tin-the skid plates in a 74 exh system

When I had the 75 rebuilt, I used the exhaust system from a 74 bus, and
the skid plates from the 75 are not compatible, as there is no upipe
setup....don't have the 74 plates- any suggestions- like what do those
who go to 74 exhaust setups on later busses do??

&gt; If I were you, I would keep the &quot;skid plate&quot; tin because it redirects flow

&gt; would bet that the outflow aperature is different slightly to keep the amout
&gt; of air flowing over the cylinders equal.... this is just a hunch..I can't
&gt; back this up with fact. But, if I was in a hot climate where heating isn't
&gt; ever needed, I would still keep the shell of the heat exchangers and the
&gt; associated tin in place.
