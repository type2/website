Subject: Re: [T2] window regulator

Rich,

If you don't have a manual, I'd suggest you get one, as it's a pain of a 
job, not technically difficult (it was the first job I did on my old girl, 
and now I have to do it again, two winder mechanisms on the driver's door 
and replace a passenger window that was smashed in a break-in ), but a major 
pain.

Basically, you have to remove the quarter window frame to get the winder 
mechanism out and back in, you CAN'T get the mechanism around the supports 
for the frame. Any bus manual will show you where all the bolts you have to 
remove are.

It's about a 1-2 hr job, and I'll bet you swear a bit while doing it, I 
always do ;^)

Good luck.

&gt; can anyone help me in how I am supposed to remove the %*^&amp;!_at_ window 
&gt; regulator from the drivers side window?  The one in my 75 broke and I 
&gt; currently am driving around with a 76 door inthe back seat with the panel 
&gt; removed and the regulator unscrewed, but cant remove it due to there being 
&gt; no room, there is a metal piece in the way, (looks like part of a plate 
&gt; supporting the small triangular window.

&gt; Thanks
&gt;
&gt; Rich
