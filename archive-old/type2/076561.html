Subject: Re: locking engine hatch

Hi Mike,

One of the members of a local VW club locked himself out of his 1974 bus
recently at the side of the road, and he actually managed to re-enter the
bus through the rear and upper engine hatches!!!

He had to remove the upper fan, air cleaner &amp; carb linkages to pull it pff,
but it was certainly preferable to breaking a window to get in.

I haven't met him in person, but I expect he must be pretty skinny. ;^)

Sometime soon I'm going to install a simple sliding pin lock on the inside
of the lid, connected to a cable release on the upper lid. Simple, but
effective. I want to put a interior release on the rear hatch as well.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.gowesty_dot_com/pics/211-827-503L.jpg
&gt; 
&gt; Go westy has them brand new, for about $60. Seems like a high price until
&gt; you lose more than that in parts someday. I know I always feel better in
&gt; certain areas with my engine hatch locked.
&gt; 
&gt; It fits the 72-79 bay busses, part  #211-827-503L.
&gt; 
&gt; Best,
&gt; Christopher

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Is there one available for the 78?  I *hate* having my engine hatch open
&gt;&gt; to the world especially after I had my AFM stolen once before.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; thanks,
&gt;&gt; Mike
