Subject: Engine swap snag - different flywheel type

Greetings all,

I finally pulled the old 1500 type 1 beetle engine out of my 72 bus to get the 
engine bay ready for the rebuilt 1700, and ran into a little snag. The 1500 
single-carb engine has the single-gland-nut flywheel and the 1700 dual-carb 
needs a 5-bolt flywheel. I guess if I would have looked at page 54 &amp; 55 of 
the Bentley manual I might have got a clue...

So I need to get a different flywheel. Of course, I don't have any part 
numbers and the 1700 is out of an automatic so it has no flywheel. The Bus 
Depot catalog lists a 210 mm flywheel (part number 021105271X) but doesn't 
say if it's a 5-bolt type.

Also, will I need to get a new clutch and pressure plate, or will the one from 
the 1500 fit?

And, do I need different bolts or will the ones from the drive plate work on 
the flywheel?

Thanks for your help. Cheers,

--
