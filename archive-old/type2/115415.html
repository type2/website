Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Heat riser repair

&gt; &gt; &gt;Good point.  How do the heat riser tubes seal to the center section?
&gt; &gt; &gt;Since there is exhaust going through that tube I want to keep in 
&gt;inside!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Aren't they just brazed?  Can't you have it re-braze welded?
&gt;
&gt;No I think not
&gt;the riser tubes run through that middle casting which I think is aluminum.


Brain fade,

I was thinking of the heat-riser flanges.  I think the center section is 
probably an interference fit with the steel tubes.  Maybe the aluminum is 
cast around the tubes.  I would think you could cut the aluminum to remove 
the heat-risers, and then heliarc it back when you were done.  Probably more 
work than just finding a good junker, or ordering one fron CB Performance.  
The nice thing about the new ones is that they can be removed without 
pulling the dynamo.
