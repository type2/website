Hi all (and Thank You! to the people who responded to my earlier EGR 
inquiries) -

Got the 'old' motor out of my '80 Vanagon.  Gonna do a clutch job, have 
flywheel resurfaced, etc.  I have a Hayes manual, so I could be overlooking 
this, but (please, no laughing):  should I put ALL plates back on prior to 
installing the rebuild?  I imagine this would be &quot;easiest&quot; (I believe I took 
off everything &amp; pulled the motor BASS ACKWARDS - didn't have the Hayes, 
lack any experience), especially as concerns putting on the engine 
compartment seal.  Once any laughter subsides, please let me know.

Also, any advice or &quot;must dos&quot; for putting a motor back in would be most 
appreciated.  Anyone have any &quot;workarounds&quot; for not being able to find a 
clutch alignment tool.  My buddy says he's known a few people who were able 
to line things up w/a screwdriver, but I'm not sure I could intuit my way 
thru' it.

I've decided (after input from most gracious list members) to plug my EGR, 
disconnect valve, &amp; have fuel air mixture adjusted by a local (Tampa, right 
now) shop.  If all goes well, the Vanagon will soon carry me back to lovely 
Colorado...if all goes well.

Thanks all,

Mark
