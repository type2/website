&gt;Is there a gasket for this connection?  

Yes!  There was originally a thin rubber strip that went across the covers
as well as on the 'S' tubes where they mate to the fan shroud.  The strip
served to create a better seal between the metal and fan shroud.  I recently
acquired a 914 that had been sitting for over 20 years and the rubber strips
were still in place!

&gt;Is one available from anywhere?  

No!  I've never seen anyone repro-ing these.  Most folks don't even know
about them.

&gt;And if not, has anyone any ideas for a replacement?

Theoretically, just about anything should work.  Maybe some home weather
stripping from your local hardware store?  If nothing else, I suppose you
could use silicone, but it'd be messy.  I'm not sure how hot that area gets
- cool air should always be blowing through there when the motor is running.
