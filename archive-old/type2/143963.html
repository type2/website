Subject: burning bus on COPS

Hi Guys.  I walked through the den a couple of nights
ago and a COPS rerun was on.  The police were trying
to calm down a greasy man in an absolute panic.  Turns
out he had been working on his bus and had a gas line
loose.  He turned it over and WHAM.  It caught on fire
and it caught the house on fire that he was backed up
against.  He kept going on and on about how stupid it
was that he forgot that gas line.  And he burned his
best friend's house down!  The blaze was really
roaring.  Total loss of the bus and the house. 
Anybody else catch that episode?  I still smell gas
from that vent up under the wheel well when I fill up.
 Is it OK to just plug that thing?  Bus drivers, beware...KR
