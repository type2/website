Subject: Hole in case

Greg:

I believe the hole that you are talking about is the access hole for
unbolting the torque converter for an automatic transmission.  If so, there
really isn't supposed to be anything there.  Even if you don't have an auto
trans, the hole will still be in the engine case casting.

IMHO, an engine spewing large amounts of oil from this hole would be
indicative of a leaky front (front means toward front of car) main seal.
