Subject: re: RE: [T2] re: westy outdoor car cover/winter storage?

Sorry to disagree but I just went out and looked at the tag and it said
Coverking. It also said 'made in Mexico'.

&gt; I've used the car covers sold by Rocky Mtn Motorworks (which
&gt; I believe are made by Coverking)

I'm not sure who makes theirs but it is not Coverking.
