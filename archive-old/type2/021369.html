Subject: Re: [T2] Canoe INSIDE a bus

&gt; &gt; If you're only going a short distance you can simply make the bed
and
slide
&gt; &gt; the canoe in through the back.

I would recommend (highly) that if you throw that canoe on top, you add
an extra rope over the top. My canoe had a little plastic thingy in the
front that the front rope went through. One day while travelong 70 mph
in a driving rainstorm that thingy broke, givimg enough slack for the
ropes to come loose. I saw my canoe fly off the back and tailgaters
fishtailin all over the highway. I thought sure I had wiped out a whole
family, but everybody got through it OK. As for me. . . I crossed three
lanes of traffic in about three secs and hit the median strip. The canoe
bounced along behind and survived with little damage. This is a
fiberglass canoe that was built for whitewater. I like to think of it as
a test!! He he. So, add an extra rope or better yet, be like me. . .
put ropes all over that thing!

Should have seen the wifes face. Ha ha.
