Subject: Re: [T2] Plumbing &amp; Fuel Pump for a late BN4 Gas Heater

That's a neat idea. I should have been messing with this stuff
during the Christmas break. Now school is about to start and
time will be limited. Oh well. I'll have to make some time. 
Warmth is important! Thanks for all your help with this!
