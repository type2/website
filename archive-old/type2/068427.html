The stock alternator (55 amp) handles three batteries just fine, in my
experience.  Doesn't burn up, burn out, or anything else.  I'll be swapping
the aging marine group 27 deep cycles for golf cart batteries soon - then
we'll see what that alternator is really made of.

&gt;I have seen
&gt;the ads in VW Trends for the 85amp drop in replacement alternator for
&gt;type2's.  Does anyone have one of these? How are they?

Dunno, but I bet they are expensive.
