&gt; It's somewhat different.
&gt; The sender will read a bit cooler in a self-drilled plate because of where

&gt; The self-drilled plate positions the sender outside of the main crankcase
&gt; in a slightly more sheltered area, and closer to the outside of the engine.

Yes, you are right. I was being nice, I just didn't want any &quot;home-maders&quot;
to get sender envy :-) I used to have the &quot;home-made&quot; one on the same engine
and that behaviour was noticeable.

It also makes a difference what engine case code you have as to how the
gauge/sender works, the 914 engine case and the early bus TIV cases are
different than the late cases in the sump plate well area. If you use a sump
plate sender in a hydraulic case it will read very slowly because the sump
plate well area is almost completely isolated from the main volume of the
sump. It will still work at full operating temp and be useful, it will just
take a very long time to reach temperature.
