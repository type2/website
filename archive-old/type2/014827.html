i am needing a set of tires for my 73 work van.  i have searched the archives
for a couple days and have narrowed my decision down to a few choices.  size:
1) 195/75/14  2)  205/75/14.....i currently have on a set of the #2.  i also
have found a tire store that has a set of the #2 in a light truck tire with a
1532 lb. load rating, hercules brand, 50k tire, balancing, new valve stems,
disposale, tax, everything incuded comes to $293.88.  this sounds like a
reasonable price.  does anyone have any real experience with a hercules tire??
the tires i have had on there for the past few years came with the van and are
only a standard load tire, yet they seem to handle really well.  the tread is
still good, except they are starting to show some bad weathering cracks on the
sidewall.  FWIW i use the van daily hauling medium to heavy loads ( up to 2500
lbs. max.).  any other suggestions from *real * life experiences.???  i will
be needing to get tires in the next two days, i am going out of town (16 hrs
round trip hauling at least a ton of weight ) and want a good set of tires b 4
this trip.............
