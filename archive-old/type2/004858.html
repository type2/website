Well in a stroke of amazment my set of 94mm pistons and liners came today
&gt;from NOPI, amazement because I ordered them Monday, they shipped ground and
frankly I didn't expect to have them this week.  The salesman had told me he
thought they would be Mahle Brazil which are frankly the only sets I've
really seen in engines I've torn down, but they end up Cofap which is
apparently Kobelshmidt (sp?) Brazil, or at least bought the KS mold cores,
the KS is there and you can see where the Germany marks are removed.  Anyway
NOPI had the best price I could find bar none, the main purchase reason
$243, $258 shipped to me in WV.  I hope there is no hidden bad rep on these
things I didn't realize.

So I start to take a look at them clean em up in preparation for
Hooverizing.  First measured everything, the pistons and cylinders were
remarkably uniform, coming out within tens of thousandths across the entire
set, quite impressive.  One liner exhibited an ever so slight out of
roundness in one plane at the top of the cylinder, but I'm talking under
half a thousandth.  Rings all came out slightly on the loosish side, top and
middle rings with 0.023-0.025 gaps, and oil control rings showing .016 on
average.  On the top side of what the book says but I'm not complaining.  I
like the fact very much that these have the &quot;2 part&quot; oil control ring, I
HATE the &quot;3 part&quot; style with the wavy metal thing and two flimsy little ring
parts, these have a spring behind one nice solid iron ring as god intended.
The piston to liner clearance comes out on the bottom side, about 0.0014 or
so for the widest part of the skirt.  I will note there was no cosmoline or
anything on the liners, and only a hare of light machine oil on the rings,
some rings and the inside of the liners showed a slight rust haze, but not
unacceptable and I'm about to polish them off anyway.  Pistons were of the
light weight group (and I note unlike the Mahle I have seen these are still
marked to both size and weight with the correct paint dots) and were within
+/- 2 grams of each other, pins were within +/- 0.2 grams.  All in all I'm
quite satisfied, I have no idea of the KS Brazil reputation but hell they
are the same as all those bug sets out there.  The pistons had the graphite
bath coating but most of it washed off while cleaning.  Only thing I didn't
care for is the slots behind the oil control rings weren't deburred very
well and some of the pistons had an occasional scratch from crud in the
liner, however a sloppy mechanic could probably have thrown them on out of
the box with no real problems.

Which bringeth me to Hoover.  This is the first engine build I've done since
reading his wisdom 3 years ago and so naturally I intended to paint them and
scrub the barrels with Bon Ami.  Just finished the painting tonight and I
just want to say, GOOD GOSH, had I known it would take me 2 hours to paint
the set one coat, I might have just lived with it.  I was pretty carefull
and wanted a nice thin but uniform coat but it is amazing how long it takes
to do if you maintain just a bit of care and anality.  And the buggers get
REAL heavy to hold to.  But I'm happy I did, tomorrow I'll scrub the barrels
and start balancing out the pistons.

This has been a useless public service anouncement by.
