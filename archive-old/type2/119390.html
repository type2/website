Subject: Paint colors for 1972 T2

This week I went nowhere but did over 500Km on
my &quot;new&quot; T2 bus just for the fun of driving it.
I love to drive it and will definitely pass it to 
my grandchildren, if I have any, so I decided to
restore it to a close to new condition.
It does not look bad but there are a few rust 
problems that need to be fixed before they get 
worse. As it has to be painted and orange was not
its original color (it was white then light blue 
then dark red then orange) I may as well choose 
one of the original colours that I like best.

My question: What were the colours for 1972 T2
buses? Are there any catalogs available? Can those
VW paints still be ordered?

Joaquim
