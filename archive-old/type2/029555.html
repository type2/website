&gt; I tried to remove the fanhub with pulley pullers etc. with no luck. Went to
&gt; the archives and read about putting a piece of metal between the case and
&gt; hub and then tighten the bolts to hold the strips in place and then evenly
&gt; tighten the bolts to slide the hub off the crankshaft. Well all was going
&gt; well- I could see it sliding off but would not yet pull off. So I tightened
&gt; a bit more and the case around the crank cracked and then of course the hub
&gt; came off. 

This is why I have never been comfortable with this method of hub removal
:-(  I know it is the VW-recommended method, but the case is not flat
there and it is a seam, so you are applying high point pressures at an
inherent weak spot.  No thanks.

Many years ago, I bought a set of snap-on pullers (everyone has one
snap-on tool, this is mine :-) for way too much money and thru the years I
have never regretted it.  If you have a 3-jaw puller, it fits right under
the three bolt ears of the hub, If you have a 2-jaw puller, it will fit
under the locating pin ear and the bolt ear opposite that.  I would
recommend inserting bolts in the holes in the ears to prevent distortion
while pulling (don't know if it works, but I do it habitually)
