Subject: seat interchangability 

Today while scrounging around a junkyard I came across a 
74 camper with highback bucket seats in fair condition . 
It looks to me that the seat mounts on either side are 
identical to those on my 72 Westy. Am I correct in 
assuming that the 74 seats will slide right into mine? I 
had taken my motorcycle as I was only searching for 
small things, so I couldn't try them out or haul them 
home. 
The guy at the counter said i could have the pair for 50 
bucks. not bad eh?
