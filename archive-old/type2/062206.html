Subject: Re: Help with push rod tubes

The later engines like my 78 use pushrod tubes you slide out thru the head
after you pull the rocker arm assemblies amd unscrew the tin covers from
below so that you can GRAB the tubes and twist them out- should be easy if
some fool didn't use sealer or glue to put them in previously.  DON'T use
the sealer- if it breaks up, it can fall into your valve cover head and get
into engine, or get into your hydraulic lifters- a past mechanic had done
this before I did it myself, and I kept finding pieces of red silicone on
the oil screen!! Use the O-rings on the tubes and slide the tubes back in;
this is a little harder to snug them in; watch from below to check.  I'd
pull the pushrods before you do this so you can clean them and check that
oil can flow thru them easily.   Not difficult; make sure those spring
clips go back right that hold the tubes in place even if o-rings get too
much play, or tube can travel into valve cover side and dump oil. MB
