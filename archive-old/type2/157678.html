&gt; Re the suggestion of a self-draining ice chest- I always thought it was
&gt; more efficient (longest cooling period) to let a cooler &quot;stew in its own
&gt; 32 deg F juices&quot; until all the ice had melted, as opposed to letting it
&gt; drain the constant melted water away- is that not true?  My common sense
&gt; thinking is by draining it, you are throwing away 32 deg water, much
&gt; cooler than the surrounding air of a summer day!  Yes, ice may be  below
&gt; 32 deg when made in a freezer, so the air inside the cooler may be
&gt; initially colder, but it won't last as long in is job of keeping drinks
&gt; 40-50deg cooler on a hot day?  Me, I avoid the mess by freezing water in
&gt; old OJ cartons and putting them in my cooler- gives you drinkable cold
&gt; water to boot.

My take on it is that you are trying to keep the stuff inside the cooler
cold for as long as possible.  If you allow water to pool inside the
cooler you are creating a lower resistance heat path from the inner walls
of the cooler to the ice, causing the ice to melt faster.

Now, that is just my supposition.  The only way to resolve the problem is
by putting two identical ice chests side-by-side, one drained, and one
not.  Instrument a &quot;food&quot; container inside each chest and see which one
stays colder and/or stays cold longer.

What I have always done with my old metal Coleman ice chest is to keep a
beach towel folded on top of the chest.  When I stop, I drain the water
from the ice chest onto the towel, then use the towel to cover the ice
chest.  This keeps the outside of the chest cooler though evaporative
cooling which reduces heat flow from the outside of the chest to the
inside.  Essentially, I'm using two phase changes of the ice to cool a bit
longer, the ice/water phase change inside the chest, and the water/water
vapor phase change outside the chest.

The white towel covering the ice chest also stops it from being heated by
the sun shining on it.
