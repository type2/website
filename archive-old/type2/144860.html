&gt; Headed back towards Boulder wondering what to do. On CO-36 just outside of

don,

i live 5 minutes from where this chuck e cheeses is.  had i known you
were broke down there i could have brought your mightyvac to you and
saved myself an hour trip to bring it back to you at your / troy's home!

just kidding.  i could have loaned you tooth brushes or something though.
if nothing else we could have had a beer or i could have brought my
cordless drill.  Don't ever call a taxi when you're broke down 5 minutes
from me!  you do have my cell number right?  i would have been happy to
give you and the family a lift home or help out in any way i can.

sorry the trip turned out like it did.  at least you broke down on the
way back.
