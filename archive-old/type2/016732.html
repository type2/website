Mike:

FWIW, I'm inclined to agree with your supposition - that the concern is
not only with exhaust gases under pressure, but also what's coming out
the tailpipe and has the potential for getting sucked into
negative-pressure in the heat exchangers if a &quot;pull&quot; rather than a
&quot;push&quot; blower is used.

The later Type IV-engined buses actually have a pair of warm air exhaust
pipes, through which heat exchanger air is expelled when the heater flap
valves are closed.
