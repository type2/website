Subject: RE: [T2] F/I Head Temp

&gt;I ran the same idea past my father a few years ago -- he *teaches* the EE's

 

At least I'm not crazy - thanks Hal

 

 

&gt;-- and the short version of the conversation is that while it's certainly 

&gt;a feasible idea, it's really not cost-effective to do so.  

 

Too bad!

 

 

&gt;Cheaper to buy a CHT or pyrometer that's already on the market 

 

I guess that will be the route I go when the cash is there.

 

Thanks to all for their input!

 

Wayne
