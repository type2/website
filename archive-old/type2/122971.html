Subject: [T2] Broken braking?

I have had months of terrible brake problems, with the pedal being fine
after bleeding and then starting to degenerate within days, going from hard,
to middle, to hard again and then finally to the floor needing pumping to
bring the pressure back up.  Well I tried everything replacing the master
kit, some pipes, and so on but no joy.  My handbrake also did not work
properly, as I was awaiting new cables from VW on the advice of my last
mechanic who said they were broken.  Out of desperation I took it to yet
another mechanic who said that the cables were not broken and that he just
needed to fit a spacer inside the rear drums on the lever for the handbrake
and hey presto..brand new brakes at a total cost of about $13.00 (labour in
SA is cheap)   Don't ask me exactly what he did, but I think the lack of
proper adjustment in the Handbrake affected the pressure in the whole system
somehow, then of course I could be talking absolute rubbish, but everything
now works.
