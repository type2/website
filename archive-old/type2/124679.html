&gt;You missed a graet campout at Naturalbus

&gt;Yeah rub it in. Hope to catch
at least a couple campouts this year.

Natural Bus was a blast!! Me and Karen took a 9 day bus camping excersion
ending at Natural Bus. What a great campout! I am working on a complete
page/trip report/pics right now.

Don't forget the Third Annual Sunshine Daydream bus campout is coming up
July 4th weekend for those of you in the SouthEast, and you will still have
a full month to recover for High Country!!

I am working on a carabus list now if you know you are coming email me and
I'll add you to the list.
