Subject: engine conversion



i have a 1977 bus with the stock 2 liter feul injected engine.  i am going 
to replace it with a 1700cc carbed engine.  i was wondering what 
considerations i should take.  do i have to do anything with the fuel pump 
and lines.  if any of you have ever done something like this before i would 
greatly appreciate your impute.  also does the exhuast from my 2000cc fit on 
a 1700cc. thanks
