(actually it's the first time I did that) - ok, fine 'till then. After =
that I=20
went for a drive and pulled on a service station to pressurize the=20
container. I read somewhere that it should be pressurized to a=20
maximum of 42 PSI - so I choose to fill it at 35 PSI. A friend=20
reached for the air pump hose and I plugged it in. For some=20
seconds nothing seemed to happen, then I heard a &quot;swiissh&quot; like=20
sound and I saw that I was loosing air through the bus hose, a little=20
while after I felt my pants wet - I looked and saw that cleaning fluid=20
was pouring from under the steering wheel.  I screw the cap and =20
tested the washer and it had very little pressure on.
What exactly went wrong? Thanks in advance!
