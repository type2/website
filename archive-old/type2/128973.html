Subject: Re: [T2] bus idles high when warm

Yes, the idle screw does work fine.

You know what.. lemme go check the aux air valve and make sure that 
thing's working ok.  I might crank the adjusting nut on it to make it 
open more, then drop the idle down a little when warm and maybe it'll 
equalize things out a little bit better.

As far as the MS, it's a manifold pressure base system, so any air leak 
after the throttle plate would be just like opening the throttle plate. 
  But I'm just wondering if a heated engine would cause more vacuum leaks?

thanks,
Mike

&gt; i know very little about MS, but here is my two cents anyhow:
&gt; 
&gt; i am doubtful that a high idle would be caused by the injectors. the idle
&gt; speed is affected by the amount of AIR, not fuel. there is nothing the
&gt; injectors could be doing (or not doing) that would cause the idle to be
&gt; high.
&gt; 
&gt; can you regulate the idle effectively with the idle adjustment screw on the
&gt; throttle valve?
