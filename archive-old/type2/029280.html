One tool you may want to obtain is an &quot;impact tool&quot;.  This is the hand-held (and hammer struck) tool that usually comes with a set of high-impact screwdriver bits.  Get this and an impact socket for your wheel lug nuts (or bolts) and you can get all sorts of things unstuck without anyone else's help.  Usually very reasonably priced too.
