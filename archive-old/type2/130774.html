Subject: Re: [T2] !_at_!_at_#% Key won't come out!

Hi Ben,

There is no quick way to replace the lock cylinder. But I can help you 
out with the rear hatch.

You can open the rear hatch from the inside. Remove the interior panel 
and you will see a tab  on the side of the lock mechanism. Just pull 
the tab towards yourself and the latch will open.

My Westfakia has a small hole drilled in the cover panel and a loop of 
nylon string attached to the tab. That allows me to use the rear hatch 
for stealthy midnight escapes that don't wake everyone in the bus the 
way the sliding door does.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Well, I was enjoying the first nice day I could bomb aroun town in my 
&gt; Bus now that the lights were working for signals and brakes!  Gas is 
&gt; getting low so I turned into the SHELL station to fill up. Turned her 
&gt; off and the _at_#_at_% key stuck.  If I wiggle it the dash lights go off or 
&gt; the dash light go on.  I pop-started her and drove home.  Is there a 
&gt; quick way to pop the lock without removing the steering wheel, etc.? 
&gt; Or a known way to release the tumblers?  Also, the key I have is the 
&gt; ONLY key to the back gate which is now locked.
