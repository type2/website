Subject: Re: [T2] Starter woes

Mark,

Yes, I know the value of new, but the starters I have gotten from
Autozone in the past 4 years(have 6 vw's) are all still turning fine.

They also say &quot;Bosch&quot; on them and were rebuilds.

They also have a &quot;lifetime&quot; guarantee.

First thing you have posted in a long time that I gotta 
disagree with!&lt;grin&gt;

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello Eric and List   First mistake is using cheap starter from Autozone, 
&gt; same as making chicken salad out of chicken poop.  Second did you change the 
&gt; bushing in the trans?  For my money I'm going with the Bosch New starters.
