Subject: A T4 piston oddessy, err oddity

Well I just came by something pretty weird, and I'm wondering if anyone 
has a clue.  A set of T4 pistons and cylinders NOS sitting in an NPR 
box marked as 1800 on the outside of the box by p/n.  Now the odd thing 
is they are 85.5mm pistons and cylinders.  Yep an aftermarket set of 
1600cc T4 pistons????  I honestly have no clue and wondered if anyone 
else did.  Was there a 1600 T4 in Europe?  The only application I ever 
knew of a 1600 T4 was the few years in the mid 70's when there was 
briefly a 1600cc T4 Super Vee class, perhaps that is their origin.  
Anyway I've only seen pictures of the set, and have someone elses word 
for their size, so who knows, maybe they will in fact end up a nice 
96mm NPR overbore set like the box implies, otherwise these are a very 
VERY weird set of T4 P&amp;C's.
