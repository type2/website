Subject: How do I get Lock cylinder out of back hatch latch?

Volks: I am changing the back hatch latch on my van.
I'd like to put the old lock cylinder in the new latch so I can
use the same key as the rest of the van. I can't figure out
how to remove the cylinder from the latch?

PS: I know this is in the archives, but don't know where they are?
I thought this was at the top, or bottom of every list, but its not.
Maybe it should be?

Anyone have info about this POR 15 gas tank stuff? I'd like to try
swabbing my filler neck with some to seal the cracks?

Thanks
