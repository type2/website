&gt; &gt; 1976 Chev Astro van Coil over shocks work
&gt; &gt;fine,, that is what is on my 74 Westfalia
&gt;
&gt; There was no Astro van in 1976, they started in 1985.
&gt; Perhaps there is better information for this ?

I had a '76 Pontiac Astre, which was the pontiac version of the Chevy
Vega.  Could that be the car in question?
