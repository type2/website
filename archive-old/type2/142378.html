&gt;What could cause a no clearance situation with the #1 intake valve?

A sunken valve seat or a stretched valve stem or both.

&gt;Chasing worsening lifter racket, I dissasembled the rocker assembly for
&gt;#1 and pulled the lifters.  Yep, exhaust harder than a rock, so I'll
&gt;replace it,

Firm is good. What wrong with that lifter?

&gt;doesn't seem to want to pump up at all and I'm not gonna
&gt;mess with the bentley procedure for bleedin' the bloody things, not when
&gt;a new lifter is $10....  Intake lifter fine, able to depress it with my
&gt;finger or a chopstick.

Lifters should not be compressible if they are full of oil and working correctly.

New lifters only come with a little bit of machine oil to keep them from rusting. You'll need to fill them with engine oil and bleed them to get the circlip over the plunger.

&gt;But noticed that even with the adjustment screw completely OUT of the
&gt;rocker arm on the intake, there's negative clearance between the valve
&gt;stem and the rocker arm.  TDC, of course.
&gt;
&gt;Dissasembled, it all looks good.  Valve stems the same height and
&gt;straight, push rods straight, no sign of any hammering on push rods,
&gt;rockers or adjustment screw.  Adjustment screw heads look as new -
&gt;nicely convex.

Confusing.

&gt;Does it matter?  Currently probably all adjusted to 2 turns per the
&gt;local mechanic who replaced my 1-2 head almost a year ago today, I'll go
&gt;thru and adjust all to 3/4 turn after it's back together.

1.5 works for me.
