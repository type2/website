&lt;concerning a catylytic heater&gt;
&gt; The brand is Olympian, US Catalytic.  Thats all I can tell you, the
parts
&gt; man wouldn't tell me where the company is located (he wanted to sell
them
&gt; to me).

A few seconds with webcrawler yielded:

http://www_dot_uscatalytic_dot_com/

Looks pretty good, although I'm leery of catilytic heaters.  I have a
friend who just about got killed by a defective one.  Definitly get a
CO alarm if you are running one of these!
