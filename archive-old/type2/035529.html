Ok i found the little silver box that the aux battery hooks up to, but i
only have one battery cable hooked to it. Its the negative cable, but there
is a red wire running from the left side of the fire wall and its tied off
above the silver box. Am i missing something back there? Also found a 2 or
3 inch diameter hole on the left rear wheel well, it looks factory to me,
any ideas on what thats for? Also just realized I'm missing the sink cover
for my Westy did they all come with one?
Any help would be great!!
