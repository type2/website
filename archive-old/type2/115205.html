Subject: smoke

Dear list,


    Recently i have been doing some work on getting my bus running right.  I 
still haven't eliminated the popcorn sounds but i think that maybe taken 
care of once i check the dwell this week (my meter is coming in the mail).  
But today i noticed that i could smell an odd exauhst smell when driving 
then i noticed that there was a cloud of smoke behind me :(

I want to figure out why all of a sudden my bus would start smoking.

Some symptoms

1.  Smokes after i have been driving for a little while.
2.  Noticable when i accelerate not during idle or when i am at a constant 
speed
3.  The tail pipe has a black liquid on it.   smells like gas... but is 
black like oil
4.  Never smoked in the past just instantly one day

If anyone has some possiblities of things i can check.  Hopefully it could 
be a problem with to much gas or something in the mixture.
