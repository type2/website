&gt; I'm kinda a bike racer as well as a vw dude and have done the Mt Washington
&gt; Auto Road bike race several times. The race is easy, its just 7.6 miles with
&gt; only one hill. One problem though it averages a 12.5 percent grade with 18
&gt; percent sections and a 22 percent short kick at the end.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone ever done it in a bus? Id love to try. F'n scary road. How about
&gt; those brakes?

I've sat in a bus and looked at it from the bottom!!!
