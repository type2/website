Hey there, I was just up there, twice! 
Go directly to, do not stop, do not use chemicals, do not hesitate.
Go to your local U-DO-IT car wash place.  Set the hand wand to high 
power rinse (more power than wash) and hit your top.  At about 6 
inches away from your top the pressure washes everything away, 
including the black yucki stuff.  It worked so well on my recent 
purchase, that I took my daily driver and did it to that one too.
One can stand on your fibreglass top if you stay near the edge.  
Fibreglass is very strong in compression (over a vertical support) 
but not as good in bending.  Use your ears and sense of touch to 
guide you. If it's bending back off. BTW find a tall wash bay (bonk).
Angle the spray AWAY from joints in the rubber seals to keep from 
separating the seal from the fibreglass.  I tried several chemicals, 
and nothing worked as well as good old fashioned elbow grease with a 
stiff brush (at least until, more power, more power, unh, unh, 
spray).

As for protecting the surface AFTER cleaning.  Haven't figured out 
that part out yet, any solutions?  Just couldn't resist getting it 
clean *finally*.

&gt; Give me some pointers, those of you who have been (up) there, and
&gt; tell me if I should paint, scrub some more, or get out the Clorox.
