&gt;The Gates hose you mentioned sounds like the material they sell at marine
&gt;supply houses for inboard engine exhaust hose.  As far as I know Gates is
the
&gt;only company making this hose in the 2.25&quot; size.


Exactly, around here industrial supply (often fastener, belt, power
transmission, and bearing places) sell it or agricultural places and heavy
truck places.  I note though Gates also sells a similar product for truck
coolant that is not up to the task by formulation.  I really desired the
&quot;normal&quot; you mention but the other was there on the shelf, the engine was
out, etc.
