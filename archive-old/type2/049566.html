Subject: Re: [T2] Sell the van?! (A friday question...  I think...)

Why is this an either/or question.  Someone gives you the Escort.  You
take the bus to Mom's house and park it in the back yard.  Go to
school in the Escort, come home on vacations and drive the bus.  Put
it back and go back to school.

Where's the problem???
