&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    Now onto the bigger problem. I have no brake lights. I recently
wired up a new ignition switch and cleaned up the wiring from the turn
signals. Any Ideas. The bus is a 71 Campmobile. I am so close to getting her
running. Now &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Of course, check the bulbs and sockets, clean the ground connections, make
sure wires are attached, etc. I did all this a month ago and found nothing
wrong at the light itself. Turned out to be the pressure switches on the
master cylinder. I replaced both of them (I have a 74--don't know if the 71
also has two. List?) with Wells brand from my FLAPS and the lights work like
a champ. If you do replace them, don't forget tp bleed the cylinder after
installing.
