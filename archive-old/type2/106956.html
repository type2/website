Subject: Re: [T2] 14 inch versus 15 inch 

&gt;Ooooohhhhhhh... now you've done it!  

Every time we post a thread on this and call
those folks, gowesty raises the price again. 
Then Chris mentions that the same wheels are
available as snow tires for audis for $35 a pop
(but you have to machine the center hub) and
interest drops back off...

&gt;As for tire choices, they mention 215/65-15 as
being commonly available (and isn't that the
Eurovan size?).  

No tires with the correct max load and max tire
pressure.  1540 is probably the the minimum but
don't forget that P215/65/15 with 1515 max load
are only equivalent to a max load of 1450 or
something in a non-P rated tire.  I no longer
remember off the top of my head but I think 45
psi is the minimum max pressure.  

205/65/15 Agilis would work.  Pricey though.
