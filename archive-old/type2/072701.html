Subject: Re: AFM disconnected: ( bad idle)
Message-Id: &lt;v01540b00b36fa3634159_at_[207.224.205.125]&gt;

&gt;I have been having trouble with my 77 westy (2.0L FI),  I have not been able
&gt;to get it to idle smoothly.  It keeps skipping and stalling unless I keep
&gt;reving it.
&gt;Here is what has been done.  new points, cap, rotor (timing set, valve
&gt;adjusted), fairly new fuel pump and filter (4k miles), NEW coil, Checked the
&gt;fuel injectors (all spraying nicely).  Sooooooo...
&gt;after reading all the posts about the disconecting the AFM and the bus still
&gt;running I thought I would give it a shot.  WOHOOOOO!!!  it idles like a champ
&gt;but won't run much above that (makes sense since that's what would tell the
&gt;injectors to open longer (more fuel))...so I then checked the resistances
&gt;between the terminal (7 terminals)..just barely out: 308 between 6 &amp; 9
&gt;(should be 100-300) and 207 between 7 &amp; 8 (should be 80-200).  Is this the
&gt;problem??  I wouldn't have thought that being out by only 7 or 8 ohms (out of
&gt;200 or 300) would cause such caos???  Any thoughts??
&gt;
&gt;BTW I am going to borrow a  known working AFM from a great mechanic in
&gt;Natick, MA.  He has been extremly helpful (evidence by the fact that he's
&gt;going to lend me a working AFM).  If you are in the area and need a VW
&gt;mechanic (air cooled or water cooled) you should give him a call; Greg's
&gt;Repair (508)647-9749
&gt;
&gt;Please let me know if you think the AFM is the culprit.


Mike:

I don't think either the AFM or the ECU are the problem.


Here is a Few of things I would suggest you might try:

1st check for arcing secondary wires as the other listee said.
Don't forget to check the plug connectors as well as the dizzy cap for
arcing marks.  ALSO RECHECK YOUR VACUMN LINES INCLUDING TO AUX AIR VALVE.

2nd  check the connectors of the AFM plug. I found a problem on my bus was
that the one of the connector prongs on the AFM plug had rattled loose and
receeded in the plug housing so there was only a sporatic connection.  Take
the plug off and look to see if all the connector prongs are forward in the
plug. Check the injector plugs as well.


3rd  I would vote for the cold start valve or the thermo time switch being
the problem.  After the engine is warmed up remove and check the cold start
for spray or drip.  If you don't want to disconnect the cold start, you can
by pass it with a pipe and just check to see if the idle stablizes.

Bentleys test figures don't jive exactly with the other Bosch F I manuals.
I'd use the following values so you don't replace perfectly good parts.

I notice you have a 77 like mine.  Check to see if you have a Altitude
switch or sensor.  If you do it is mounted on the top mounting bolt on the
ECU.  If you have this Email me back and I'll tell you what to do.


The following tests are a compilation of resistance test for the FI system:
(Test from the Harness plug, and or later the devise, but NEVER TEST THE ECU)

1. Take the harness off the ECU

2. Look in the list library (EFI-Samick, I think) for a description of the
numbering on the pins.  Also fig 4-23 on pg 21 of Bentley shows pin
locations on the harness.

3. put ohm meter contact between #13 and #17 ground.  This tests the
Temperature sensor II.  At 68 degrees it should be between 2000-2900 ohms.
(700-1000 _at_122 degrees; 200-400 _at_ 176 degrees; and less than 200 at
operating temp.)  Testing this at the plug test whether there is a problem
in the harness too.  If this shows a problem  check the sensor threads for
corrosion or looseness.

4.  Test between #6 and # 27 to check the Air temp sensor in the AFM.  It
should be between 2100-2900 _at_ 68 degrees.

Note: if you find a problem,  check the readings at the device.  This will
tell whether its the harness or the devise.

5. Test the following AFM circuits:

            6 &amp; 7      40-300 ohms

            6 &amp; 8      130-260 ohms

            6 &amp; 9      200-400 ohms     (100-300 ohms)

            7 &amp; 8      100-500 ohms     (80-200 ohms)

            8 &amp; 9      70-140 ohms

The readings to the (side) are from bentley for 76 up models but I found
that the Bentley figures didn't jive with the other manuals and were to
restrictive.  (You'll be throwing away good part if you use Bentley).

Let me know what you find?  I'M COMPILING A OVERVIEW OF COMMON FI FAULTS,
SO PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT THE FINAL PROBLEM WAS.

Have fun
