&gt; Re-examine the idea behind weights and centrifical advance...
&gt;
&gt; More weights, advance faster...less weight, advance slower or not
&gt; all the way....at least this is how the 009 works.
&gt;
&gt; Centrifical force spins the weights faster causing more advance 
&gt; quicker.
&gt;
&gt; Not all engines die from being advanced too much...wink,wink.
&gt;
&gt; Too much retard gets you almost the same problem as too much advance.

Dave:

My thought is that the broken spring results in more advance than if 
the spring were intact.  The weights pull outward against the springs 
due to centrifugal force as they spin.  The springs resist this pull, 
but stretch in proportion to their intrinsic spring constant allowing 
the weights to move outward thus advancing the spark.  With only one 
spring to resist the centrifugal force, instead of two, you would 
experience more advance.  right????
