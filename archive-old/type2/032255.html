Dear List,

I'm sure its typical, but I have my new engine installed after several
months of slow work, and it will not run.  From smelling the exhaust, it
clearly is getting some gas, and there is a spark firing, but I have not
been able to check its timing, since I need to devise a starter switch or
else fine a friend toi turn the key.  So I guess I have compression, I
seem to have some gas, and some spark, other than timing the spark, and
verifying the flow of gas from the injectors, what other steps would
people recommend.
