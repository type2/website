Subject: gas leak help

I discovered a gas leak out of the fuel line where it
runs above the axle. (Odd thing: A beautiful snowball
of delicate ice crystals had formed around the leak.)

Good news: the drip is from the frazzled end of the
hose where it attaches to a metal tube that then takes
it through the firewall to the pump.

Seems a simple fix of trimming the hose and pushing it
on further. Maybe a little hose clamp. (After I drain
the little gas left.)

QUESTION: This bus has been worked over so many times
I'm not sure how the fuel line should run. The metal
tube seems to be loose and hanging a little low over
the axle. Also, is there a simple cleaning I could
perform since the tank is empty?

BTW, the lines seem relatively new. The f.o. said they
were *probably* replaced about a year and a half ago.
