The drainage capability is essential, or you'll wind up with a truly
horrendous rust repair job.

It's also critical that the rubber spacers/seals around the rack attachment
screws are in place and intact.  Water often seeps in around the base of
these and accumulates in the space between the roof and the inner steel
panel.  Your first indication of trouble may be when the overhead caves in
without warning!

Some folks use a plain black edge trim material to finish off the lower
edges of the fiberglass rack structure.  It leaves the gap open for drainage
while providing an &quot;aesthetic upgrade&quot;.

FWIW.....
