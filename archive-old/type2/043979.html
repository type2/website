 Just press in/out, yes?  Do the guides need to be reamed, or anything?
 What size reamer?  no chance i can pull the guides out of Steves heads and
 reuse them in the SIR heads, is there?
 
 what to do...what do do.  any suggestions?  I'd love to get this thing
 together this weekend, then next weekend coem up nad drag it all down to
 the bus and install it..(campout the weekend after....)
 
 so.  ideas?
  &gt;&gt;
yes they need to be pressed in and then reamed- with the 8mm or 6mm size as 
per matching your valves.

I found new heads in this area for $105 DPea, $125 SPea- not much more than 
rebuilding them.  Then cleaned the flashing out with a skilsaw and files and 
a drill,  for better air flow.  motor assembly today- (not for my bus btw)
