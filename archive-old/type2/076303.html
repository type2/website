Subject: bosch(cereal box) good reading

Folks,

This morning, wwhile waiting for my coffee to warm up, and noticing the
box for my new Bosch wires, I read the box.....I really should not have.

First thing that caught my eye was &quot;Bosch Premium Wire Set&quot;..hmmmm this is
good.  So I started reading....kinda like the cereal box at breakfast.

Read all sorts of good things including &quot;4 cyl engine, 6 wires in
box&quot;...hmmmmm(in early morning haze)...why *6* wires in box?...ohhh, two
different lengths of coil to cap wires...well...that's ok...now I have an
extra!

*But* Then I read the side panel!!!

Right on the side it states &quot;For American and Asian makes only.&quot;!!!!!!!!!

Uhhhh, still in early morning haze....This bus(78 t2) was made in
Germany!_at__at_#$%^&amp;*()!!!!  Does this mean that Bosch won't handle the
&quot;Limited Life Time Warranty&quot; if I put these wires on my bus???

So I go back and look at the top of the box and it *clearly* states...
&quot;Fits: Porsche/Volkswagen&quot;.

To my knowledge, *no* Porsche has *ever* been made in the good ole'
U.S. of A.

I'm sure the rice burners would enjoy this&lt;grin&gt;....just goes to show...do
*not* read the box!&lt;grin&gt;

BTW the wires worked perfectly well on my &quot;made in Germany&quot; bus....at
least I hope it was made in Germany......&lt;grin&gt;

I just had to go look...yep, the 78 bus  says &quot;Made in West Germany&quot; on
the manufacturing sticker.....ROFL...what do I do now!!!

Merry Christmas, dave
