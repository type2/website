Subject: Re: [T2] Re: POR 15--Now PaintFest

First thing to do is line this event all up with Chris in Tenn.

This is where I was assuming we were going to do the Paitfest

Second-- BYOB--I tell ya waht to bring--so there isn't any financial
responsability left in some one else's lap.
Whatever's left--you guys can split up--or take your stuff with you.

Third--September is better than June--

Two reasons;
It will give everyone plenty of time to get their money and parts
together and get as much as they can done on the vehicles prior to
arriving--the rest we can get done on site.

And I have some comitments in June--July--
August would be good expept that the paint would be setting up pretty
fast --and this can be good or bad--
I don't want to sweating in the fresh paint.

I believe to be organized--and be prepared--
But here's a thought--don't go getting anybody out of the group
involved--like the electric company--
The less who know about this caper the better off we'll be--believe me.

A Blue Boy would be a good idea--maybe Chris could work that out for us
--locating and contacting the Porta San guy for us prior to
arrival--we'll pay him for that when we get there.

Materials--

Bondo?--25.00 (?)

3-M spot putty--$20.00

 Dupont Vari Prime--about 48 bucks a quart

Sherwin Williams Ultra fill about $78.00 a gallon.

Duponts Uro Prime--about $80.00 a quart ( with the hardner and reducer )

A fiver of laquer thinner about $40.00

3-M 3/4&quot; tape about 4 bucks a roll

A log of masking paper about $28.00

A sleeve of razor blades abot $5.00

A sleeve of 3-M 180 sandpaper about $49.00

A sleeve of 3-M 320 sandpaper about $49.00

Now if you guys plan on doing any power sanding with a DA the pad's I
have are all velcro backed--

6&quot; 3-M 80-about $45.00

6' 3-M 180-about $45.00

6&quot; 320 3-M-about $45.00

Paint?

A gallon of reducer about 28.00
A gallon of paint--about $145.00
A quart of hardner--about  $60.00

And this isn't etched in stone--the differece in the paint prices
depends on the pigments required to make the mix.
Red being the most expensive--white and black being the less expensive.

Concept urethane being the most expensive--Delstar being the less.
Check around at any local PPG store for firm pricing on the paint.

Check around at other paint store's for the prices on the paper and
primer's

I'll be staying in my Westy--lodging isn't a problem-- 

I could bring my Westy Tent for a couple of guys--

A shower would be an absolute necessity--a hose would be OK--or I'll put
a hot up a shower bag in my luggage rack.

A hose to my Van would be neat.

Other than that---

Get it all lined up--get ahold of Chris--and figure the first couple of
weeks in September--this would work out the best and give everyone
plenty of time to get all the dot's and dashes dialed in.
