Subject: No starting problems

Hey all, about a month and a half I ago I attempted to drive my 69 westy to
Mexico for a bike ride, I got about 60 miles out of town and she crapped out
on my. She was running real strong. Everything was great and then I noticed
a real slight hesitation that progressed for about 15 miles and then died.
It kind of felt like I was running out of gas or something.

I posted this on the samba and asked a few other people and the consensus
was a problem with my points, like I burned them up or something. It sounded
logical so I bought some new points, a rotor, condensor and a dist. cap.
When I went to pull of the old points I discovered an electronic ignition.
So I definitely didn't burn up any points or anything. I proceeded to put on
the new cap and rotor, and a new fuel filter. I put a good charge on the
battery and she cranks real good, but just wont turn over.

I want to run a compression check, but the book says to run the engine for a
few minutes before doing that. Can I do a compression check with a cold
engine?
Could there be a problem with the electronic ignition? I know nothing about
those. Should I do a valve adjustment? I have the &quot;keeping your volkswagen
alive&quot;
book, and read it quite a lot yesterday, I checked and trouble shooted most
of it's suggestions, except checking the coil. If the coil was bad, It would
cause me
to crap out like I did on the freeway right? Could I have overheated the
heads and lost compression?

As you can tell, I have a lot of questions.

Thanks for any help.
