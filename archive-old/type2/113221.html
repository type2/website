Subject: Re: [T2] no end play :(

&gt; How many shims did you have installed when you checked end float? You should
&gt; have had TWO. Then you do the math and find what shim you need to give the

this was with zero shims!  Problem was the washer on the engine mount
hitting the flywheel ;)


&gt; As an aside, you have to be philosophical about taking the crankcase apart
&gt; once it is together. These things happen when building engines. Sometimes it
&gt; takes a few tries to get it all perfect. It will probably happen a few more

Yeah, I was just annoyed that it was glued.  I hate hammering on the
things to get it to split - that glue is strong stuff.  That's the part
that scares me.  I've heard the horror stories of cases cracking and
that's the last thing I need.  I did make sure to triple check that all
bolts were removed and also tapped all around the case to get it to
creep apart.  Slowly but surely :)

I do understand the time involved and I also understand why Jake Raby
charges so much for his engines.  My machining cost me about 1100 for
all the milling and balancing, then another few hundred for the cam and
lifters.  Then add all the time checking and double checking everything
- it all adds up.

I think it's a great learning experience and I think this engine is
going to run sweet.  This last thing threw me for a curve, though!
