Subject: Resto upgrades.

The bus has been booked in with my mate Bob.
(_at_Prestige_Bodylines.Kings_Lynn_dot_uk) He has promised
me that when I get her back she will look like new.
We are talking 'Total Resto'.

So, to the point. What would you have had done to your
bus when it underwent a resto if you had thought of it 
in time?

Rather than clutter up the mailing list you could mail 
direct to me, any ideas would be &lt;bold&gt; greatly &lt;/bold&gt;
appreciated.


Simon.
