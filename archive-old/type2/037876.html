&gt; Now THAT is a very cool idea. Simple, elegant and virtually undiagnosable

now that is one of the better ideas I've heard of

&gt; Wierd theft story:

I once bought a bus NEW! a 1971 bay window.. about two months or so after
I had it, I was at work and away on a trip, leaving the bus on the company
lot. (24hr manned) when I got back my bus was gone!

friend gave me a lift home after filling out the police report etc.  next
morning I get a call from the salesman who sold me the bus. &quot;why is your
bus in the lot??&quot; 

quick run down to the lot and there sits my bus, only effect was the
sliding door lock had been broken and a half tank of gas was gone.

I was one lucky sob, after that I have been pretty paranoid
