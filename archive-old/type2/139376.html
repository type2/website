Subject: Opinions or information on Gabriel Gas Shocks

Hi Type2ers,



On eBay the past couple of weeks there have been listings for Gabriel
Gas Shocks for the VW Type II. There have been sets for the rear and the
front. The listing is located at
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;rd=1&amp;item=79366
18296&amp;category=33590. I searched the archive for information and came up
with five results, no complaints or problems mentioned at all with them.
With the recent buzz on the threads about the Koni's and my knowledge of
KYB, is there any opinion on the shocks manufactured by Gabriel? I
understand that the Koni's are the best, but I am in college and I am
starting to be able to make it look like I have hydraulics at the stop
light.



Thanks,



Max
