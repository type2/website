&gt; I know you were joking, I am just joking back a bit!  The small generator=
s
&gt; are, however, an excellent idea if you can afford one.  They are fairly
&gt; quiet and will eliminate any concerns about 12V/shore power while camping=
.

Actually, I was only half joking.

How many &quot;I want to run an electric space heater off my alternator&quot; posts
have we had lately? Or &quot;how many electric blankets can I run in my Bus&quot;
posts? Really!

Next thing ya know, someone's going to install a wood stove in his Bus. Woo=
d
fired automotive heat, the perfect accessory for the Bus owner with too dam=
n
much time on his hands. It's reasonably efficient. It won't run down your
battery, you don=B9t have to worry about the Eberspacher setting the Bus on
fire, and the kids can roast marshmallows over it on long trips!
