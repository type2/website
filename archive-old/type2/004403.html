Subject: Re: [T2] Westy green plaid fabric question


&gt; While I was there, he gave me a green plaid
&gt; westy coushin. This coushin is the back to the westy
&gt; bed. (not the coushin over the engine). It is in
&gt; fantastic shape. it is only missing one snap and the
&gt; others still have their un worn black paint on them.
&gt; The cover is bright not streched out. I think I will
&gt; hold on to it for now.

A little puzzled here.....the only snaps on the green plaid is on the 2 upper
mattress's to hold them in place.  The plaid covers on the rear bench seat
bottom and back are stapled on all around the back side.

&gt; &lt;Question&gt;

&gt; I know that westy plaid frabric has been throughly
&gt; discussed but I wnated to know if there was any one
&gt; now that sold the westy green plaid fabric  for
&gt; cushins. I have searched the archives, and some of
&gt; the well know vw suppliers.Please let me know if any  &gt; one does. I fear that
I am opening up a can of worms.
&gt; sorry. Any help would be most appreciated!!!

As far as I know, the only source is to use the upper mattress's for
material.....if you can find them :)
