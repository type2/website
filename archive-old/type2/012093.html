&gt;&gt; &gt; Another question I had was about something on the list I read a few days
&gt;&gt; &gt; ago, I believe someoe said not to run 10w anything if you want your
engine
&gt;&gt; &gt; to last. My mechanic told me to use 20w50 in the summer and 10w40 in the
&gt;&gt; &gt; winter, I haven't had any problems yet, is there something he and I don't
&gt;&gt; &gt; know?

I made the 10W40 rec, and I stand by it.  VW removed 10W40 from their charts
in about 1985 and later and that was for watercooled cars with plenty of
cooling
capacity.  If they still made an air cooled car, I'd bet they would have
removed
it from those manuals as well.  They left 10W30 in the book, but as always
the max temp rec for it and the 10W40 was pretty low, I don't have a book but
about 50-60F wouldn't suprise me.  10W40's proved to be overmodified (I'm
talkind non-synthetics here BTW) as a rule.  There is a lot of data out there
among performance types on the www to support this.  VW says don't use
it and that is good enough for me.  I routinely run 15W40 in the winter in
cars
I intend to keep.  Will you see any difference in your ownership of the
vehicle,
probably not unless you are intending on keeping it 150k miles, but I figure
if VW said not to, and if 15W40 only costs me $0.25 more a quart, as I know
what heavy hot running pigs buses and vans are, why not use it?  There is
a concern about using the diesel weight oil in a high mileage dirty engine
as the diesel additive/detergent pack used to be a lot more agressive.  This
isn't such a problem now, but if you switch to 15W40 you might consider
a first change a bit sooner than you normally would, I usually do a 3000
change instead of the 5000 changes I normally do in T4's with flow through
filtration and hydraulic lifters.  Obviously 1600 changes are more frequent.

At that time I might also have mentioned that the cleanest best running 2.0
I've ever seen was run religiously on straight 40 summer, and 30 winter, that
is NOT non-detergent BTW, just straight grade detergent oils.  I don't use
them, but I could eat off the inside of that engine with 90k on it now, it
looks better than most do at 25k.  I do still use Valvoine 30 and 40 in that
engine exclusively.
