Subject: Gerbil engine replacement, part V

In our previous episode, it was rumoured:
:  [...]  Although both the cylinder tin and the deck tin have holes
:  for screws, neither has the welded-on nut the screw goes into.  I
:  ended up scrounging a bolt from one of the old exhaust clamps,
:  putting a couple of washers on it, and using that to force the two
:  pieces together.  Looks like it'll work, but it doesn't seem like
:  quite the right solution.

As you'd expect, it was indeed not the right solution.  Turns out
(thanks for the info, Herr Hoover) there are supposed to be two
roughly rectangular pieces that go behind the rear cylinders under the
deck tin.  I went down to Recycle and said ``I need cooling tin, but
I'm not sure what''.  After a few rounds of Twenty Questions, we
arrived at the expedient solution, which was to go look at an engine
they had just finished putting together.  Turns out that all I was
missing was just those two rear pieces.  On the down-side, it meant I
got to see a non-trivial amount of their warehouse.  Talk about toy
stores....

After that, last Friday I tried to finish up the last bit of out-of-
vehicle assembly I could do, preparatory to (hopefully) installing it
that evening.  Installing the new lower rear cylinder tin took the
usual extra long time, due to having to reshape the after-market upper
cylinder tin and the wrong-engine rear deck (that the fresh air tubes
go through on their way to the heater boxes).  Got the spade
connectors onto the compu-fire wires (why they don't pre-install those
is beyond me), and installed the new plug wires.  Managed to ding one
of them up a bit trying to get them all into the spiffy new plastic
plug wire holders that I bought to fill in the holes in the fan
housing, and eventually decided that particular wire didn't need to be
held down at that particular spot.

So much for getting the installation done Friday evening.  A friend
showed up, and helped me put it onto the floor jack, so at least I
wouldn't have to start Saturday dead-lifting a hundred kilos.

On Saturday, the first thing was to make sure that the body was ready
for the engine to be installed.  Since the starter is not the one I've
used before, I tightened up the one mount that's always there, wired
it up, and had an assistant turn the key.  It seemed to operate pretty
much as expected, modulo some alignment problems (mostly due to not
being bolted in properly, it looked like).  I unwired everything,
pulled the starter out, greased the bendix and such really well, and
put it back in.  I did not torque down the one mounting stud, as it
seems like you won't get proper alignment if you don't tighten the
upper mount stud first.  That, of course, can't be done until the
engine is in.  Wired it back up, and went on to the next step.

I'd picked up a new fuel filter while I was at Recycle, so instead of
using the couple-months-old one, I went ahead and swapped the new one
in.  It turns out that there are several different models of those
little plastic filters.  Some want the fuel to flow into the cup
formed by the paper element, and then through it's bottom, and others
want it to go the other way.  This explains why the old looked wrong
- -- I'm used to the ones that go the other direction.  Triple-checked
the flow-direction arrows on both, and that is indeed how it is.
Weird.

Took a few pictures of how the fuel line now goes through the
bulkhead, instead of the engine tin.  They should be on the web page
in the next few days, along with some other shots.

Rolled the engine out to behind the bus.  Put 2.5 quarts of oil into
the main oil fill, and about a teaspoon into each cylinder.  Tightened
down spark plugs, and fought with getting the new wires to fully seat.
They aren't quite as agreeable about that as the previous set.

Next, we attempted to install the engine.  First hang-up was getting
the tranny/clutch splines to mate up, but a bit of engine rotation
took care of that.  Yet again, the by-eye clutch alignment worked.
Then, with a bit of jockeying around, got the engine all the way
snugged up against the tranny.  Threaded the nuts onto the lower studs
while my assistant tried to start the nut on the upper-left stud.
Despite many valiant attempts, this was not to be.  Looking up, I saw
that the bolt wasn't in all the way, and did various things to
convince it to seat down.  It refused to go the last quarter inch,
which explains why she couldn't find its threads to put the nut onto.
By now, it was getting on close to noon, and I decided that stopping
for breakfast was the better part of valor.

When we got back, we pulled the engine back out completely, since it
seemed like the bolt was hanging up halfway into the hole in the
engine case.  What I found was that, yes indeed, that's exactly what
was happening.  There's this weird not-quite-brass-looking circle
thing sitting there on the engine side of the bolt hole.  Hmmm.
Looking through it, it seems to be lined up ok.  I'm not real sure why
it's here.  Try fitting the bolt through, and it hangs up about where
the circle thing starts.  Hmmmmmm.  On a whim, I try turning the bolt.
It's threaded.  Harrumph.  How, I ask you, are you supposed to thread
a bolt into this thing, when it is physically impossible to get a
wrench or socket onto the end of the bolt, and even if you could, the
bolt's got a half-moon head rather than something a wrench or socket
could grab onto anyway?

Think about it for a few seconds.  Decide that the Brazillians are
weird.  Figure the circle thing is tack-welded in place, since it
doesn't need to resist much pressure.  Thread the bolt all the way
into it, brace the engine, and start tapping on the head-end of the
bolt to try to break the circle thing free of the case.  That's
strange -- where're all those metal filings coming from?  A couple
more taps, and I see that the circle thing is retreating from the
case, but rather than having broken a minor weld, it's bringing this
ugly set of teeth with it (go watch Jaws, you'll get the idea, but the
teeth pointed out from the axis instead of in towards it).  A few more
taps and the thing is completely free.  Judicious rag work and blowing
clear away all the little bits of metal that the teeth had brought
with them.  I'd wondered about this thing when I had the engine on the
bench, but figured it was a spacer of some sort, and ignored it.  I
wish I'd dealt with it then, as this contretemps was more frustration
than it was really worth.

Put the engine back into the bus.  Things went much faster this time,
since the splines were lined up and nothing was blocking various
mounting bolts from going in.  Hooked up the fresh and hot air ducts,
and wired the heater boxes open.

Question:  which way do you turn the heater control knob in a '66 to
           close the boxes?  Pretend you are facing the knob (i.e.,
           looking towards the engine from the front of the bus) and
           report clockwise or counter-clockwise.  That little bit of
           information doesn't appear in my owner's manual, and thus
           I've always just wired them open in the theory that I'd
           rather have heat in summer than cold in winter.

Connected all the wiring up.  I had, of course, neglected to mark
which wire went where.  However, there's only about seven wires, all
of different lengths.  It's hard to get them wrong, except for the two
that go to the alternator.  Fortunately, that pair is in its own
bundle, and they're pretty firmly fixed in their shapes -- just laying
them near where they should go made it obvious which one went where.

Checked the oil in air cleaner.  It seemed fairly clean, so I just
installed it rather than draining and refilling it.  I'm going to have
enough trouble with all the used oil I'm going to generate in the next
few weeks to want to add any I don't have to.

Time to time the engine statically, so's I can get it running and time
it more precisely.  This is rough, because I don't have a clear
indicator of TDC on the pulley.  Even more challenging, however, is
that I don't know where this engine is supposed to be timed to.  Scat
said to treat it like it's a 1974 engine.  Well, my books have a bunch
of different timings for '74 engines, depending on whether they're
connected to a manual or automatic transmission, at sea level or not,
and if the mechanic's name is Muir or Bentley.  Everything's BTDC,
except for one entry that's for 10 degrees *after* TDC.  Grumble.
Take a rough average of all the settings, and come up with 6 degrees
BTDC.

Cranked the engine for a while, and discovered that the battery wasn't
real happy.  Since it's been sitting for a couple of months, that's
not all that surprising.  So, called a friend to bring his car over,
to provide sufficient power to run the starter for a while.  He gets
here, and we try cranking it some more.  There's a fair amount of
low-key screeching, which could be the starter, could be the engine,
could be the parrot next door.  I note that I'm not real sure which
tube on the fuel pump is inlet and the other outlet (I've got
illustrations of two different models, one with outlet on top, the
other with it on bottom; neither model is the one on my engine).  Have
an assistant watch the fuel filter while I crank the engine some more.
Yup, there's bubbles getting blown.  Reversed the connections on the
fuel pump.

Cranked the engine some more, but still nothing.  Not even trying to
start.  A sniff check reveals a complete lack of fuel in the exhaust
pipe.  Too much air in the fuel line?  Pulled the line off of the
carb, and it's completely dry.  Hang out for a minute, and some fuel
starts trying to fountain out of the end.  Clamp it off again with the
vice grips, connect it back to the carburetor, tighten the hose clamp,
and removed the vice grips.

Cranked the engine some more, and it finally catches after a little
bit.  Considering how the timing was done, and that the carburetor is
suspect, it runs amazingly well.  Let it carry on for fifteen minutes,
admiring the various colours of smoke and fumes coming off of the
various never-before-heated metal surfaces.  Oddly enough, the odor
from the heater boxes that's delivered to the cab is very similar to
burning electronics.  Nothing electrical appears to be having
problems, though, and it is somewhat similar to the odors I got when I
replaced the heater boxes a few months ago, so I'm assuming for now
that it's the preservative on the inside of the fresh air duct part of
the new extractor exhaust system.

Got the nifty-keen oil change kit thing, which you put under the
engine, unscrew a plug in the top of, and let the oil drain down on
and thence into.  Went to undo the drain plug on the engine, and
realized that yes, indeed, this is a bus engine.  No drain plug, just
the solid plate.  Go ahead and pull the plate mostly off (loosen all
the stud nuts, start removing until oil comes out at an appreciable
rate).  After about two thirds of the nuts were removed, we got this
very vehement shower of hot oil.  In this case, vehement means it
looked like a waterfall, and splattered out in a circle about five
foot in diameter.  Annoyingly enough, this is about twice the diameter
of the nifty-keen oil change kit thing.  Hot oil on bare skin didn't
do my assistant a lot of good, either, but it was relatively minor.
Decide it's time to let it drain thoroughly, and cool off, so we take
a short break.

After a while, I pulled the oil screen and inspected it.  Found one
suspicious-looking bit, that could have gotten there in the process of
removing the screen.  The oil itself had looked good enough to put
back in (not that I even considered it; I bought a case of oil when
planning for this phase of the project for a reason).  Since I would
rather not repeat the five-foot shower of oil, I pulled the drain-
plug-equipped plate from the old engine, and tried to clean all the
metal flakes off it.  They didn't want to come off, and I really
didn't want to dink with it much more at the time, so I reinstalled
the solid plate, together with new gaskets and washers (even
remembered to put the oil screen back in, too).  Dumped in another 2.5
quarts of fresh oil.

Started the engine up again, and proceeded to tweak the carb and
timing until it sounded pretty close to right.  I couldn't do better,
lacking a tach or a strobe, as well as the aforementioned
inconsistency in the references about where to time it to anyway.
Sounding about right means that it idled well, and didn't
significantly misfire when revved up.

Cleaned up, and went to dinner in Boulder in the bus to celebrate
(about 15 miles away).  I took the back roads so that there'd be lots
of speed variations, and no really heavy-duty loads (i.e., no highway
speeds, slow hill-climbing).  Went fine, except that it seemed like
it'd have lots of power some times, and not quite as much power as the
old engine'd had at others.  The starter still didn't sound quite
right, either.

The next day, I checked the valves (fifteen minutes idle time, plus 38
miles driving).  All had much larger clearances than they should
(.006&quot;) except for #3 exhaust, which hadn't changed at all.

Question:  If a valve is said to be `loose', does that mean the
           clearance between the rocker and the valve is larger than
           it should be, or smaller?  I.e., where is the `looseness'
           that is being referred to?

Went ahead and cleaned up the drain-plug plate.  Changed the oil
(cold, to reduce splashing).  It was noticeably cloudy this time.
Installed the drain-plug plate instead of the one the engine came
with.  Played around with the timing some more, but couldn't seem to
get it to be any happier than it was.  I did note that the distributor
was somewhat loose when I started (with effort, I could move it), so
my theory is that that's at least part of the flaky power.  Made sure
it was locked down tight this time.

Drove around about 138 miles.  Had to push-start once.  Seems to
dislike starting more the warmer the engine is.  Changed the oil again
(hot, this time).  It was much darker, about like what I expected used
engine oil to look like (think porter, or strong coffee).  Washed the
oil screen, on someone else's advice.  This is a bad thing to do,
because getting the blasted thing dry afterwards can be a major
undertaking (bits of whatever drying medium you use can get caught in
it, and be almost impossible to remove).  Slathered permatex #2 on
everything before reinstalling the screen and drain plate.  I'd had
some slight leakage before, but no sign of any since.

Remembered that I was going to tighten the lower starter mounting stud
after the engine, so went ahead and did that.  It still makes some odd
noises, but not nearly as badly, and it's much more consistent about
actually getting the engine running.  Still not happy if the engine's
gotten hot, and then sat for half an hour, though.

The next morning (we're up to Tuesday, July 16 1996 now), I adjusted
the valves again.  They had all increased the rocker/valve clearance
by a fair amount, although I didn't check to see by how much.  It's
going to take a while to get used to using a 15mm wrench to deal with
the lock nuts; the old heads were 13mm.

The tightening of the tranny sidecovers helped reduce the leak from
there, but I'm still seeing oil under the left side of it every time I
stop.  Since it's got problems with popping out of gear anyway, I may
push up the replacement date for it, rather than try to dink with it
all the time.

This thing has *much* more power than I'm used to.  Compared to what I
had, I don't understand why people complain about lack of power from a
1600 (unless their 1600s are old and tired like my previous engine, of
course).  The heat works *very* well; not having flow restrictors
helps.  Replacing the heater box hose that disappeared after a visit
to a local shop helped, too.  The break-in is obviously starting to
happen, as it is running much more smoothly than during the initial
fifteen-minute idle, and also somewhat more quietly.  It has an
occasional stumble just past idle, when accelerating.  It's
intermittent enough to be a bad electrical connection somewhere.

Question:  I've got all the cooling tin you could want (more than any
           other engine I've owned has had), the thermostat is
           operating correctly, and in general, the cooling system
           looks sane.  However, after running for half an hour or so,
           the engine fails the dipstick test (can't hold my finger on
           it for more than a couple of seconds).  I suspect this is a
           timing issue.  Should I advance or retard it?  Would fuel
           mix have an effect?  If so, how do you adjust it on a
           34PICT3?  None of my manuals covers that particular model.

The next oil change will be this Friday evening, when I've put another
hundred and twenty or so miles on it.  I may check valves Friday
morning, but definitely Saturday morning.  It's time to pick up
another case of oil (I've been using straight 40 weight for the
break-in) and another box of latex gloves.  Yes, I went through fifty
pairs in a couple of (long) weekends.  But, it never took more than
five minutes to feel clean enough to eat a burger in a restaurant....

Question:  I've got a line on a Westfalia pop-top for the Gerbil
           ('66).  Is it possible to install one in a normal bus,
           without having to cut roof frame members?  It's the small
           square type, not the full-length type.
