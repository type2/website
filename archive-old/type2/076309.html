Great, man.
I've been on the list about three years.
When i tore into the 74 bus i used to have, the only thing that got me th=
rough
was repeatedly coming back to the list and reading about these busses and=
 the
people who drive them.
I never would have finished if it weren't for this bunch and their passio=
n for
the bus.

Thanks to the list and to the admins.
