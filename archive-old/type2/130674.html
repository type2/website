Subject: accessory plug update

Thanks for the info on the accessory plug.  I printed off the article 
entitled Shinny Socket and gave it to John.  He is going to order the 
John Deere part.

My main man Rick Taylor, has a couple spares.  Eventually I'll get one 
from him and pass it on to John, so that he had a genuine VW part.

Your advice was awesome!!!

John couldn't believe all the information I had for him in less than 24 
hours.  I told him he needs to sell his Thing and his Kubel and buy a 
bus.  He just smiled and goosed stepped away.

Thanks again,
mjr
