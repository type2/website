&gt; &gt;&gt;Think about it.  The reason that it feels cooler to the touch is that

&gt; Depends on design, if you had a finned heat sink on hot device 3' long,
&gt; chances are the heat would be dissapated by the time it ever got to the
&gt; end of the fins.  I believe that fins have been used in certain
&gt; applcations to lower the temperature of the surface that can actually be
&gt; touched.
&gt;
&gt; Make no dougt about it, aluminum is more thermally (and electically)
&gt; conductive than steel.

However, the aluminum covers are quite a bit thicker than the steel.
thickness reduces the heat transfer by conduction.  There's more to it
than the material.  If you wanted the ideal situation here, you would make
the covers of thin aluminum, anodize it black, and form ripples in the
material.  The result would be efficient, but fragile and hard to form.

Another consderation is the medium transferring the heat to the
dissipating surface.  The valve covers are not full of oil and in fact are
pretty much empty except for a oil fog and droplets flying around inside.
This is not really a good situation with which to transfer heat from the
oil.  You can't transfer heat from the head, either, because the gasket is
an effective insulator.

If you want to cool the oil effectively, you need to get the oil as a
liquid and then put it in contact with an efficient heat exchanger.  This
is why they went to the trouble to increase the surface area of the oil
sump with finning.

If the goal is to lower oil temperatures, a much better cost/benefit
ratio would result from modifying the existing heat exchanger (oil cooler)
for increased capacity than with alterations to the valve covers.

 &gt; &gt; &gt;They transmit heat well, they flex a bit to
conform to the gasket &gt; surface, and they were
&gt; &gt; heap to make.
&gt;
&gt; True, but mainly cheap to make,   All the 4 cylinders cars that I have
&gt; aluminum valve covers, er except the Vanagon. Heck, the 2002 V6 Odyssey
&gt; probably has them as well, but I don't really open that hood very much!

Those cars probably don't have an oil cooler, either, but I don't think
that this would be a good reason to remove the cooler from a VW!

Are you aware of the transmission problems on Odysseys?  Honda is
extending the warranty, but doesn't seem to want to fix the problem
through a proper recall.  Something to keep an eye on...

&gt; Anyone out there want to weld some fins to the steel covers (except those
&gt; darn bails get in the way) and see if the head temps go down?

A simpler way would be simply to spray water on the outer surface of the
cover and watch the head temps.  The water absorbs a lot more heat than
any finning would and would give a quick indication of how much heat can
be lost via this route.  I doubt that the temp drop would be great, even
with &quot;water cooled&quot; covers.
