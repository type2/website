Subject: since were on tires anyway.....
Message-ID: &lt;373B298D.E00C1300_at_geocities_dot_com&gt;

Ive been looking for new tires for my 72 westy. From reading the arcives
and everyone's recent posts im thinking about 195/14's on the front, and
205/14's on the back. But im very unsure of the brand/profile to buy.
