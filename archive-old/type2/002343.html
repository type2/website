Subject: Anybody ever make a set of wheel ramps for a bus?

Has anyone ever made a set of wheel ramps for a bus?  I use a set of the
usual pressed/welded metal ones to drive the front end OR the rear end of my
bus up onto for working underneath, but you can't do both, even with the two
sets I have, because they stand taller than the clearance under the body
between the wheels.  If you made a set that was just shorter than the body
clearance, then you could fix them to the ground (say with stop chocks
bolted to the garage floor, which I already have - ever have a ramp move on
you while going up it?) and drive up all four at the same time, a whole lot
faster than hyraulically lifting even one end up and setting jack stands.

I would think a set of carefully cross direction &quot;laminated&quot; 2X lumber would
do it.  Any comments?
