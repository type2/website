Subject: Rear Window Defogger Grid

I need to re-grid my entire rear window. I scraped the window and the grid 
smooth and clean with a razor blade.

I notice that the FLAPS have only repair kits.  One FLAP had a kit that 
consisted of a tiny vial of clear liquid, and a small (like, not even a 
'nickel' bag) of 'bronze colored metal shavings'.  I guess I was expected to 
mix them both and apply the paste to the window grid..

Well, that kit cost $11 !!!  And I doubt it would do a single line.


I would like to 'acquire' about an ounce of the 'bronze colored metal 
shavings' and an appropriate amount of the clear liquid.

64 dollar question:  What is the 'bronze colored metal shavings', and what 
is the 'clear liquid'.

Thank you
