&gt; &gt;I want to buy some tires for my Westy. Any suggestions will be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; 185R14C, load range D. No matter what the tire salesman says, buy no tires
&gt; that are not marked thus. Westies are inherently heavier loads and must
&gt; have these rugged specs. I expect not more than 10% of the tire stores in
&gt; America will have them in stock. Expect special order to get them. They are
&gt; not going to be 4 for $99 in the weekend-four-color-loss-leader-FLAPS-ads.
&gt; Try for Continentals as they were stock on many T-II's.

I agree with DT, but my 185R14 load range D tires do not have the &quot;C&quot;
suffix on the tire size.  I believe that the &quot;C&quot; was a european heavy duty
specification.  I am running Bridgestone RD603V tires that are available
at any Firestone outlet.  They were OEM fitment on dual-wheel Toyota
pickups.

One thing to avoid is the 195/75R14 tires.  They have a smaller OD than
the correct size and the last thing the bus needs is smaller tires!  They
are strong enough if you get load range D, but my experience with them was
unsatisfactory.  Dealers tend to stock this size more than the correct
size and are likely to pressure you by saying that the correct size is
obsolete and this size &quot;supercedes&quot; it, but that is not true.  Learn from
my mistake!
