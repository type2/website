It's called All-Metal. Manufactured by USC Chemical. Good stuff. I

&gt; I was told by a local body guy that most modern paints are not compatible with
&gt; lead filler and to either remove it or find primer specifically for lead filler.
&gt; THe &quot;shade tree mechanic&quot; on tnn also said this in one episode.  I have also seen
&gt; a new filler made up of aluminum but have heard nothing about it, anyone heard
&gt; anything about this?
