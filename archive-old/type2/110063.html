Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for '77 driver side door:)

Hi Meg,

Jeff Stewart ran into this problem a couple years back when working on 
his 76 westy. His solution was deceptively simple:

The hinge bolt to the door and body differently, but the pins are the 
same. Drive out the hinge pin and you can match the new door up to the 
old hinge.

It couldn't hurt to give it a try.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hi
&gt;
&gt; I am looking for a driver side door for my 1977 westy. I would love it
&gt; if someone who has one would be willing to bring it to the bug out in
&gt; Manassas VA this weekend (May 25). Or heck I will come to your place
&gt; anywhere in the MD/DC/VA area:-) I am looking for a nice door with no
&gt; previous body work done to it.
&gt;
&gt; I have a nice one that I thought was a 77 door but the hinges were
&gt; different? Would this be a 78 door? Did they change it after 77? Well
&gt; any help would be grately appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Peace
&gt;
