&gt;Sadly, today's test drive revealed there is something still very wrong.
&gt;Right front wheel makes a rubbing sound periodically on the rotation, as if
&gt;the rotor were warped, and when I brake, wow! is there some noise.  I of
&gt;course bled everything before my test drive, and still there was what I
&gt;thought to be too much room before they started grabbing in the first place.
&gt;
&gt;Are my rotors hosed?  Should I have listened to the first mechanic?  Or did
&gt;I somewhere fail horribly in my reassembly?

Probably is the rotors. Did the first mechanic measure them?? Sounds like
he did and they were to thin. Did the second mechanic measure them?? Sounds
like he didn't and thinks he can turn anything. Now add the cost of new
rotors to the extra labor for redo (time) and wasted $18 (money). I wonder
how many rotors he thinks he can turn accurately before replacing his
cutting bit?? 

As to noise generally, did you clean the calipers well, then apply
lubricant at the points where the pad backing plates rub on the backs and
sides?? Then break in the new pads with a quick 25mph moderate braking
every 1/4 mile for 2 miles or so??
