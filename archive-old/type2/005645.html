One source for automotive and marine gel-cell batteries is NAPA.

I was at my local NAPA store this afternoon, and checked out their house
brand gel-cell batteries.  They have no specifications, etc., restricting
the type of vehicle or charging system for these batteries, and nothing
appears on the installation or warranty tags/paperwork that restricts how
they are installed.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  don't take that as a blanket recommendation!  I do parallel small
gel-cells with the battery in my bus to charge them, but this is my
experience only and does not guarantee success.

Most gel-cells have specific charging specifications printed on the side of
the battery.  Get out a multimeter and make sure that the charging voltage
and current do not exceed the stated values.  If they don't, you
should be fine!  &lt;&lt;
