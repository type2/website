&gt; About this pump thing, I've just got one question.  What about every other
&gt; time you start the engine, ie when it hasn't just been rebuilt?  It seems
&gt; to me that the system must drain out after sitting for any length of time,
&gt; and then, other than a small bit of residual oil, its essentially got to
&gt; self prime itself each time the engine starts.  Now, I know people are
&gt; going to jusp at the 'residual oil' phrase, and tell me thats the
&gt; difference, but then why not just put in some residual oil upon rebuild?
&gt; And also, don't bother to tell me that the system never drains, since the
&gt; other end of the oil passages are cetrainly above the 'water table'
&gt; conststuted by the oil level at rest.  So how could the oil pump thing be
&gt; more than a ritual which none of us can really test the importance of in
&gt; any objective way?  Just my thoughts about the thread.

Well.... the &quot;residual&quot; amount is actually quite a bit, maybe an ounce or 
so, and I'm sure it contributes a lot to the efficiency of the pump at 
startup, helping close up the close tolerances of the pump.  Also, the 
pump has its own &quot;water table&quot; since the inlet and outlet ports of the 
pump are not smack dab on the bottom of the pump; it's the height of the 
ports above the bottom of the pump that allows the pump to retain some 
oil even after sitting some time.

Why not put residual oil in at time of assembly and be done with it?  
That's probably better than just putting it in dry, but it's messy to 
handle, and while you tilt the motor up one way and then the other on the 
stand putting on heads, tin, and whatever you're putting these ports in a 
more vertical plane and probably draining it of most of its oil.
