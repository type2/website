Subject: Re: [T2] Cream colored substance in oil?

&gt;On oil... This varies very heavily depending on climate.  Here in northern
&gt;Virginia, I run 20W50 year round.  10W40 is fine in winter, but too thin
&gt;in summer.  YMMV!  I would *not* run non-detergent oil in any engine these
&gt;days.  The additive package in detergent motor oils is too valuable, not
&gt;only for cleaning but for buffering against acid attack, as described
&gt;above.

I'd like to jump into the oil discussion with some unconventional wisdom
from a friend of mine who is an aircraft mechanic and a VW enthusiast. He
runs diesel formulated oils - Shell Rotella, Chevron Delo - in his 80
Vanagon, and has convinced me to do the same with my 78 Bus. His theory is
that the operating conditions of a diesel are more similar to an aircooled
engine than an aircooled is to a watercooled. Therefore the diesel oils are
designed to cope with the high heat and extra combustion by-products better
than oils designed for waterpumpers. These oils are readily available,not
too expensive, and come in a multi-grade 15w-40, which is ideal for winter
here in Florda. During the summer I switch to a straight 40W. Results have
been good.

FWIW,
Frank  78 Bus, 67 Bug
