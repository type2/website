&gt; I grabbed the new seals that I bought from Bus Depot (not sure of the real
&gt;  origon) and fitted them on the frame. The fit was a bit loose. I went to do
&gt;  a dry fit before I got out the drill to do the holes ( these are going 
where
&gt;  no jalousie has gone before.) Damn, they wont fit. I took the seal off and
&gt;  dry fitted the window in the bus. It was tight but allowed a small anount 
of
&gt;  room to accomidate the seal. I carefully put the seal back on. Did a quick
&gt;  self check for signs of heat stroke and took another stab at it. It went in
&gt;  a little better but the seal rolled of the sides. More cursing. 
&gt;  
&gt;  At this point I am stuck. Either I am doing this incorrectly (fair chance)
&gt;  or the seal is making life tough. Seemed easier to bang the windsheild in
&gt;  the do these Jals. Even thoigh the seal does not seat around the frame
&gt;  should I use a cord on the slot that is thereto help set it in the frame?
&gt;  Could the heat have caused some expansion in the Jals? Is this really 
harder
&gt;  than it looks? I thought drilling the holes was gonna be the real problem
&gt;  not installing the window. Any advice at this point is welcomed!!
&gt;  
Chris, make sure the seals snap into place properly on the window frame.  Use 
a little spray silicone on the window opening and the seal (only the part 
that contacts the bus body).  You have to push the seal in in some places as 
necessary as you push the window in, so it is easier with two people - one to 
hold the window in and another to work the seal in where it is a problem.  
After the window is in you may need to lift the seal edge out in some places 
where it got tucked under.  I use a sharpened popsicle stick to protect the 
paint.  There is no cord like the other windows, the screws hold the window 
in, not the rubber.  Good luck.
