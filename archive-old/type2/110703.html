I have painted my motorcycle tank and some parts on my VW bug flat black and
want to protect them. Is there such a thing as a flat clearcoat, so the flat
black is protected but doesn't become shiney??

This is a common paint style that hotrodders use. It's called &quot;California
Suede&quot;. Flat black primer (usually) with a clear coat.

A guick google search ( california suede paint ) turned up a couple of hits. 

Here's one : http://www.hotrodders_dot_com/cgibin/ubb/13/000293 

Google for &quot;california suede&quot; and use paint, hot rod, etc, to limit the results
from all the fashion sites (never knew they wore that much suede in CA) :)

Hope this helps,
