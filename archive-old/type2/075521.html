Subject: Re: [T2] Another deal

Here are some pics of the 73 transporter I picked up this weekend, here on
the east coast:
http://www.72camper_dot_com/73transp.htm

I only paid 300 bucks for it, with a complete spare 1700 and a tow bar too.
Not too bad.

Meridith Murray picked up a 73/74 transporter that same day 50 miles away
FOR FREE. The deals are out there you just gotta watch for them!!

&gt; For all you wanabusers who lurk, this is the A1 best way to buy a bus,
perfect
&gt; body, blown engine.  You buy the engine from your favorite rebuilder for
$1500
&gt; and you know exactly what you got.  Look at that thing for heavens sake,
&gt; unreal.
&gt; $500 and they asked at $900 for a long time, I bet $400 would walk away
&gt; with it.
&gt; O to be on the wrong coast as usual.
