Could be poor ignition switch contacts as well. This can be verified by 
monitoring coil voltage with a VOM while wiggling the switch and watching 
for volts glitches. Just put the key in the run position and wiggle the key 
and turn it very slightly both directions. This problem is augmented by 
having a large weight of keys on your key ring.

&gt;
&gt;If it happens again I am going to bypass the switch system with a wire 
&gt;from the battery to the coil. If it acts up after that then I think it 
&gt;could only be gas related.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;When it is acting up and I turn the key to start it fires and runs 
&gt;smoothly, but as soon as the key returns to the on position it dies.
