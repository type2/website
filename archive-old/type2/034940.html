Subject: the nature of the problem has changed [was: no output from new fuel pump]

Hi, folks.

Well, I suppose I should have seen this one coming; 
perhaps some of you already did.  Contrary to my 
information and expectation [long story, you won't get 
it here] the fuel pump I replaced wasn't for an engine 
with alternator, it was for one with a generator, and 
used the longer push rod with the actuator foot 
recessed inside the base of the pump rather than flush 
with the bottom, like the new [for alternator] pump. 

[Please don't write just to tell me that I should have 
sat down with old pump and new, side by side, and 
studied them for awhile.  I got that now.]

So I have a bent push rod now, and worse, the the hard 
plastic intermediate flange that the pump rests on is 
broken into a number of pieces, the last of which is 
still down inside the block.

[Please don't write just to tell me that I'm really 
screwed.  I got that now, too.]

I'm guessing that, if it ruined the rod, it ruined the 
new pump too, so I'm going to get another of those.  
Plus a new push rod and a new plastic intermediate 
flange.  [I'm planning to go out in a few minutes with 
a hook fashioned out of coathanger and fish the last 
piece of the flange out.  That'll use up most of what's 
left of today's daylight.]

I got the pieces out of there the best I could, but I'm 
sure some little bits of the flange must have gotten 
down inside my nice new engine.  Now what?  Pray they 
come out in the next oil change?

Also, have I damaged the cam that the push rod rides on 
top of?  

thanks for any advice
