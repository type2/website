Subject: Restos don't go camping?, Oh yeah! ;-)

&quot;Surfer Bob&quot; Taylor posted obvious flame bait and said:
The tradition of doing immaculate, sanitary, meticulously detail oriented 
vehicle restoration is also a grand one. Problem is, the logical conclusion of
that path is a vehicle that is far too valuable and primo to subject to the
slings and darts of outrageous fortune on the streets and actually DRIVE
anywhere.
Much less go CAMPING in one.
 
VanBondo dutifully over reacts and writes:
I playfully say &quot;Oh yeah! Watch us!&quot; and invite you (all) to go &quot;disproving&quot;
with us once the bus is completed. =) We do intend to use the snot out of
the '67 Westy resto when &lt;soon to be&gt; completed. A specific goal is to make
it to Pismo and points north for camping. Maybe the '97 Sacramento and/or
the Solvang shows. Someday we definitely want to do the Cascade Kombi /NW
vintage shows. I also heartily agree with Ron S. as well as most of your
comments. We also love the old hippie buses. I look fwd to getting more into
fly fishing and hiking than knocking the dust off of the garage princess'
car-cover. Shoot we might even make a CCC cluster... er, ah campout.
A case in point to most all of our comments is the Dormobile owned *and
driven* by Blue Nelson. He has a totally bitchen bus which has gathered tons
of awards, been driven from Marina Del Rey up to the &quot;American&quot;/Alaskan side
of the Artic and is filled with cool, practical-useful improvements
specifically *designed* for CAMPING! Blue's Dorm is &quot;generally&quot;
Stock-original to that bus yet has A Set of SO-42 Cabinets in the condition
to die for, an IRS rearend, Type I muffler with pea shooters (why?) bent to
clear the bumper, killer homemade roof racks which hold bad old front and
rear with driving/back up lights on both as well as fog lamps down low.
German Safaris? yup, very cool Multiband SW radio? yup, CB?, yup. Flawless
paint? nope, but nice enough (at least).
My deal is that I wish that I was of the age and means to have had a new
Westy. I grew tired of always driving a beater and breaking down all the
time. Now if (when) I break down I will know who's fault it is and how to
fix it. It's been only a personal challenge/goal to make the RFH nice. I
actually would have prefered the '66 with the optional 12v to avoid
emissions if I had known...
