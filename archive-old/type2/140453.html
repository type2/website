Subject: RE: [T2] Electric winch for pulling T2's

I remember going through the same thing when loading a bus on a flat bed
recently.  I have reason to believe that it may not be as much of an issue
with this trailer.  The trailer we purchase the same model as the one at the
following link, only it's about 1.5 feet taller....which increases the rear
door length.

The rear access is made up of one large door/ramp that comes down and is
roughly 7 feet long.  The slope of the ramp and the height of the opening
are almost identical to my garage.  The trailer actually has more overhead
clearance in this case.  This leads me to believe that the slope of the ramp
should be gradual enough to allow access without the front bumper rubbing.
As far as the cable is concerned, the winch will be mounted about 1.5 feet
above the chassis and a guard is being installed across the tail of the
trailer to protect against any rubbing.

These are good points though and appreciate any others that I may have over
looked.  It turns out that getting an enclosed trailer that can hold one of
beloved T2's is not as easy as I thought it might be.

Isn't the cable going to rub on the trailer before the bus gets up on the
ramps? How high up are you going to mount it?

...we found that the built-in ramps were too short to allow the bumper the
clear before the wheels hit the ramps.
