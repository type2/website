Subject: '70 only master cylinder

The replacement M/C for a '70 has only one brake light sender. All the
original ones I have seen have two brake light senders and the wiring
harness has two plugs. What gives? Does it matter that aftermarket companies
only use one? 

 

Can a '68-'69 be used instead by blocking off the 3rd sender and using the
'70's senders with the correct prongs?

 

Also, are there rebuild kits available? I used to hone and rebuild my M/C
and brake cylinders as a kid and it worked great.

 

I should have held onto my NOS in-box '70 M/C. Hindsight is 20/20.
