Subject: [T2] Junkyard in Vermont

	Hi everybody!
	I am heading up to Vermont from Mass this weekend for some
hiking+camping. I remember someone mentioning a VW Junkyard in Vermont. I
need just a few more things to get Schlampig on the road. Does anyone have
an address or Phone # for this place?

Thanks

Jeff
