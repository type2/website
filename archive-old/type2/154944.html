Subject: RE: [T2] '76 upper bunk question

Eric,

I'll be out working on my 78 today. The interior is out, so I'll snap some
photos of the upper bunk boards, assembly and cushions. I'll also get some
precise measurements of the lot.

I love the name &quot;Soylent Green&quot;. :)

I just acquired a 76 Westy and it is missing the cushions for the upper
bunk along with the board that folds down (although I have the hinges).

Could someone give me the measurements of the cushions and the board?
Pictures would also be great.


Thanks for everyones help. Most of my questions have been answered via the
archives.

Cheers,

Eric
