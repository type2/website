Subject: Sound dampening in a 71 Westy
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Before everything goes back in, I'd like to quiet my 71 Westy as much as is
reasonably possible (quiet as perceived from the driver's seat).  My hearing
loss is getting worse and will probably continue to worsen.  Carrying on an
ordinary conversation with someone in the front passenger seat is often
difficult, and nearly impossible with someone in the bench.  Comments on the
quietest muffler, sound dampening blankets, etc. will be most appreciated.
Thanks much.  Success and not so successfulful stories are both welcome.
