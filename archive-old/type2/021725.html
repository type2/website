Subject: Sighting

Good morning all (E.S.T.)
This morning at the corner of Liverpool &amp; Bayley (Pickering, Ontario) a
mid 70's beige westy painted as &quot;the magic bus&quot; broke down while
rounding the corner. Unfortunately I was in a panic to grab my train,
and was with my father who wasn't willing to miss the train. It's a long
shot, but if you are on this list I just wanted to make sure you made it
okay.
Now for my question of the day. I have a '68 westy, with a 1600 single
port. Mostly original. I'm going to be re-working the interior, and I'm
hoping to install a gas heater. Now here's where it gets tricky(ish). In
addition I've been sort of &quot;sold&quot; on the idea of installing a second
battery, and a power converter for running things like a TV VCR combo.
Now obviously there's only so much room in the engine bay. So I have to
make the decision to either place the battery in the passenger area, or
the gas heater in the passenger area. One has to give way to the other.
Has any one done this double battery + gas heater install? Also, I've
been doing some searching for a gas heater and I have noticed that some
carry the title &quot;stationary&quot;. Is there a big difference between the
stationary and the others?
