Subject: WTB in Seattle: middle bench seat for '71 

&lt;My Bus's middle bench seat is in very, very, very
&lt;poor condition.
&lt;Anyone happen to be parting one away somewhere in
&lt;the Pacific NW?


I would try a place in Mukilteo called Bughaus. They
bought most of Bry's VW auto wrecking when they went
out of business. There is also a place in
Lynnwood/Everett area off of HWY 99 called Alseth Auto
wrecking. They have a lot of bus stuff too.
