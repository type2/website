I found a set of wiper arms for my 68 at a recycler in Iowa, but they
wanted $100 for the pair! I saw a digipic of the arms, they're not
pristine, but do look like they could be cleaned up, although one of the
springs looks crusty.. Told the guy I couldn't pay that much, he said
$80 for the pair bottom line, still way too rich for my blood. New old
stock, I could (maybe) justify that much (you know, the &quot;bank&quot;, hehe),
but not for what I saw...I know, it's a hard part to find, but still,
$100 for 31 year old wiper arms? Is this waaay too much, or am I missing
something? Anyone else have any experiences like this?

Still looking (and wondering if a cracked wiper arm can be successfully
and cleanly welded).
