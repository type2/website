&gt; This morning I disconnected the Gene Berg dipstick temperature sensor, and

check the temp gauge if possible, boiling water boils at 212F,  100C
take a hot plate or something out by the bus, put a ground wire from the
bus to the dipstick.
  boil some water, turn on your ignition, then put the end of the gauge
into the boiling water, don't let it touch the sides or bottom and read
your gauge... at this point you will have a rough idea of the gauge error.  

  PUT THE GAUGE BACK IN, but you will at least know what the &quot;Fudge
factor&quot; is,  and drive sensibly,  you have a new engine, don't drive at
high sustained speeds.  personally I wouldn't take it over about 55mph for
the first 3,000 miles or so. and vary your speeds to help the break in.

&gt; better since there was no red light glaring me in the face. When I got home,
&gt; I shut off the engine, and then started it right back up. The engine
&gt; compartment did seem pretty warm, but there was no other signs of

WARNING * WARNING * WARNING * WARNING * if  the engine compartment seemed
&quot;pretty warm&quot; it is a good bet it was.

&gt; overheating. Wouldn't there have been loss of power while cruising along at
&gt; 60 if it was actually overheating? This bus is heading to Kansas City as

no when you lose power it is pretty good chance engine has been damaged

&gt; soon as I can pack it up.

TAKE IT EASY, I know it is hard not to push it across the prairie but
resist!  not over 55, take lots and lots of breaks, enjoy the scenery take
some back roads but don't wreck your new engine before you even get &quot;home&quot;

don't drive with the adjusted temp over 240-250 if you slow down to about
50MPH and the temp doesn't come down to at least 230 pull over in the
shade, leave the engine run (some controversy about this) but when
standing still (not driving) open the rear engine door, wait for engine to
get below 200 before driving again.

change the oil ever 500 miles or so on this trip, drive in the early
morning and early evening to make use of the cooler air, stop often. take
your time and take some back roads (did I say that before?, can't say it
enough) Don't push the engine and what you don't know can hurt you and
your engine.

overheating a new engine is one of the prime causes of premature failure.

good luck, drive carefull
