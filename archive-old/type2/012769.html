list:

i am currently trying to come up with a way to install hardware
in the bus for curtains.  i looked in the library and saw the
article that talked about &quot;RECMAR slide-right curtain track&quot;.
however, i have called every RV &amp; boating supply place in my
area &amp; no one carries it.

so...i need other ideas as to how to set up curtain rods or tracks.
i need to get the hardware installed before construction of the
curtains can begin.

please help asap - i would really like to have the curtains done
in time for EveryBus!  pictures of hardware installation would be
nice if anyone has them. also i'm in digest mode so please pmail.

TIA.
