Subject: Re: [T2] Don't scrap your Buses!


&gt; Sorry, I know the request is to kill this thread, but I do have something
VW
&gt; related to say.
&gt;
&gt; With all the talk of trying to save our buses, how hard would it be for
&gt; local clubs to organize Co-op type salvage yards. How much red tape would
be
&gt; involved with such an operation? Does anything like this exist? Has anyone
&gt; tried this. No offense meant to many of our list members who operate
salvage
&gt; businesses. Its just that not everyone has a specialty salvage yard
located
&gt; near them.

This is a really neet thought, and you and I were on the same wavelength. If
enough people were interesting in doing something serious and volunteering
services and space, a 501 C could even be set up. Why not? I've looked into
non-profits a bit, and some college kids even got a 501 C3 for development
of the Klingon language! Jan B
