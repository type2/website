Subject: ** Valve adj. problem for 1.7 engine **

I have a friend that bought a Porsche 914 with a 1700 engine  and is trying 
to adjust the valves (talk about a pain to get to).  He just emailed me 
this, but im not sure what he is talking about.

&quot;I am pretty sure I found TDC and piston 1 and 2 were no
problem.  When I got to 3 I had a problem.  When I back out the
adjusting
screw the piston/spring followed.  No way to slip a feeler gauge in as
the
space kept collapsing. So, I doing something wrong or is the engine
busted?  Any ideas?&quot;
