Subject: Re: [T2] GEX Update Question...

based on the numerous posts in the archives of almost
every VW list I'm on, including this one, I wouldn't
want anything from GEX (even maybe a poster of one of
their bikini clad GEX chicks anywhere near a VW)
anywhere near my bus. I'd buy used before a HEX
engine.   

But it's your money.  Gamble if you will.

&gt; Audacious peers,
&gt; Hello. I have been reading the (horror) stories
&gt; about GEX products in the 
&gt; archives, and since i recently put a set of the
&gt; larger valve (gex) heads on 
&gt; my 2.0L Type4 motor...I have come to question. So,
&gt; has GEX improved quality 
&gt; standards, or is the concensus still that they are a
&gt; brand worth 
&gt; sidestepping? I've heard rumors that they often
&gt; charge for upgraded internal 
&gt; parts on turnkeys, that are not actually the product
&gt; that you paid for. 
&gt; Should i hold my breath on these rebuilt heads?
&gt; What's the vote out there??
