Bill,

I just called California Import parts and talked to Tim and the
seatbelts are even cheaper than JC Whitney, by about 5 bucks.  Cool. 
They hope to have the belts in next week--I'ma gonna get some for sure!

Thanks,

Lauria

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I took the original mechanical seat belt out of my 79 and went to the three
&gt; point auto like in todays cars.  The best deal I found was from California
&gt; Import Parts in B.C. Candana.  In fact they have allot of Bus parts at very
&gt; good prices. Their number is 1-800-313-3811.  I don't get anything out of
&gt; it, but if you talk with them ask for Jeff or Tim and tell them Bill Kratch
&gt; sent you.
