Subject: Re: [T2] Jumper Cable -&gt; Cig Lighter

Maybe to slowly charge the dead batt. from the good one. But not to jump 
start a very discharged batt. Most cig lighters are fused for 15 amps, and 
runs a max. 12ga wire. You really want 4ga wire or higher to jump with, as 
busses draw upwards of 100+ amps at start.
