The servo is ideally connected to the manifold by a good-sized braided
vacumn hose that leads from the manifold to a check valve in the engine
compartment, through the firewall, to a metal line welded to the
undercarriage, then again by braided hose to the servo. The check valve is
important as its function and the volume of the system forward of it serve
as a vacumn reservoir, ensuring that you'll have some boost available if the
engine should stop.

This should be in place and functioning properly for safe driving. I drove
mine without boost to the brakes for a little while and hard stops made my
knees pop (that's knees, plural, as I sometimes had to stomp that pedal with
both feet). Hook it back up. You may find that it was disconnected because
the servo leaks. Your engine may run badly or not at all with it connected,
or may stall when you mash the brakes. If so, you'll need to replace the
servo or have it rebuilt. There are sources for this but I don't know any
off the top of my head.

I am a brand new owner, and probably in over my head, but please bear 
with me.  I have tried researching this dilema and have questions.  I 
understand the servo works on a vacuum, should be connected to my 
manifold for proper operation.  (71 Westy)  In crawling under I find the 
vacuum hose plugged off.  It doesnt seem to be connected.  So how do I 
troubleshoot?  The brakes do not have any power, they seem to be 
dragging.  Bad servo?  Is the servo even connected or necessary?  Bad 
master cylinder?
