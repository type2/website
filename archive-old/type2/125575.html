Subject: Dvda for Svda swap anyone?

Hey hey, a while back I got a dizzy from a junk yard engine. It was from a type4 engine, but I don't know what year since it wasn't in a body. So anyway it's a Dual Vacuum one, and after I found out that I needed a single vacuum one I wasn't worried becouse I read how to adjust for one of the vacuums only. Anyway, now that my FI system seems to be working, I have found that the Dizzy won't rotate to the needed position becouse the extra big vacuum canister is too large to swing past the Cold Start Valve. And I think it'll start with just a LITTLE more turning. It's sounds WAY better and closer to starting the closer you turn it. 

So my question is, does anyone have a Svda dizzy but that needs a Dvda and wants to do a swap? The dizzy seems to work just fine. It just won't rotate enough becouse it's too big. 

I'm in Seattle (south side) so locals would be faster, but I don't object to shipping either. :)

Kk, lemme know. Also, might I just be being stupid and overlooking something obvious? Like can the vacuum can be moved or anything, or does it actually BELONG on the left side of the Cold Start Valve instead of over by the fan? 

BTW, it's a '76 FI with Manual Tranny. 

Chris and his silly problem of the day. :)
