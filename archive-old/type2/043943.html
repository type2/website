Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning the oil cooler...

The best way I've I've found to clean out a cooler is to force a
suitable carb or engine cleaner(Gunk&quot;HYDROSEAL,Berkebile's &quot;GUM CUTTER&quot;)
through the cooler, under slight pressure. Failing to find either of the
above cleaners a &quot;Safety Kleen&quot; Varsol-type cleaner is pretty good,
found in most good shops.._dot_use fresh Varsol if nothing else is
available.
Then, have it pressure tested(at VW dealer).

My .02 1/2.

Chris.
