I would be wary using any kind of shock to correct torsion bar sag as the shock
supports are not designed to bear any significant portion of the vehicle weight.

as for where to get the bolt ill pass along what another listee told me try

&gt; Just got the NAPA (#MA758) air shocks for my 78 Bus to quick fix my saggy
&gt; rear end. The problem is the stock bolts are about 10mm too short. The top
&gt; stock bolt is lone enough for the bottom so I really just need a new longer
&gt; bolt for the top.
&gt; I spent 2 hours checking every source in town, even a bolt specialty store-
&gt; no go.  I was informed I need a 12mm bolt that has a 1.5 thread and is 110mm
&gt; long. Does anyone know where I can get a couple of these?
