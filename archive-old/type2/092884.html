Subject: Re: [T2] Confused by Gauges

I'm not sure but I think it is installed like an oxygen sensor - just a 
bung welded into the pipe someplace after the collector (where all the 
pipes come together). I think they tune the engine until the EGT is the 
coolest or the hottest (I can't remember) and this represents maximum power 
of the engine.

I know the racer crowds and the airplane guys all use them.


&gt;How would the exhaust heat gauge tell you how your mixture was 
&gt;running?  And where does the sensor for that go, on the end of your muffler?

&gt; &gt;These are the most critical items. These are the functions that your
&gt; &gt;driving style can most affect and these are the items that can change the
&gt; &gt;most rapidly and cause the most damage.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I added a tach to the clock position b/c I wanted one.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The rest isn't important to me but there are certainly more useful gauges
&gt; &gt;to be had like exhaust gas temp gauges which can help you tune the engine
&gt; &gt;and the air/fuel ratio meter which will tell you if you are running rich or
&gt; &gt;lean, and volts or amps which can tell you if your charging system is 
&gt; failing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Despite the wide selection of gauges to be had, it is easy to run out of
&gt; &gt;space to place them or making the dash look like an airplane cockpit.
