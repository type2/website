&gt; If the boots are recently torn (not run a long distance with

&gt; I wouldn't suggest using soap and water on anything prone to corrosion, even
&gt; if you intend on using the oven to dry the parts immediately thereafter.
&gt; Use a solvent that will evaporate completely, without leaving any residue.
&gt; I like Brake-kleen.

The way that it was explained to me is that soap and water clean the dirt
out without leaching out the grease closely associated with the metal,
what you might call &quot;in the pores&quot;.

Whether this is accurate or not, I've never had corrosion problems when
washing CVs in hot water.  The metal holds enough heat that the surface
water evaporates before they cool.
