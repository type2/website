Hello all,

&gt; &gt;I've read that if the push rod tube retaining wire isn't installed
&gt; &gt;properly (properly is against the ends of the push rod tubes; see
&gt; &gt;figure 10-4 in the Engine and Clutch chapter in the Bentley manual)
&gt; &gt;then the rotation and in/out motion of the push rods against the wire

&gt; &gt;will cause that sort of groove.

I think this sounds reasonable, but the wire looks installed correctly
(exactly as shown in different manuals). The wire itself has no marks on
it, but that isn't surprising since the aluminium material of the push
rods is very soft. Some things come in my mind:

I do very short commute driving every day. So no chance for the engine
to heat up.

The thermostat had been failing in the open position. Noticed it during
my monthly valve adjustments/checking. (didn't ever notice the worn push
rods...). Took me some time to get a working one, so I was driving
around for 2 months with full cooling (it was at the end of
spring/beginning of summer).

I set the valve clearance more to the maximum than to the minimum
clearance (feeler gauge having only very slight contact).

Question:
Could driving without thermostat, always cool engine, perhaps a bit
larger valve clearance cause the push rods to have more contact with the
retaining wire and for a longer time? What to do about this?

&gt; That seems most likely doesn't it but I'm intrigued by the patterns
that &gt; were created and what caused the marks on the crankcase side?

I can only think of the rebuilder swapping the sides of used push rods,
since the distance of the marks from the tip is exactly the same on
engine and cylinder head side. I did see similar patterns of wear like
the ones on the engine side
(http://picasaweb.google_dot_de/timo.schairer/CylinderHeadSwap/photo#5091041

Cheers,
