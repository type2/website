Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Hose info needed....

MikeL,

This just came up on the list recently and as such is probably not in
the archives yet:

In response to the same question Karl von Salzen, &lt;aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;
wrote:

In order for a diaphragm to move, it has to be open to
the atmoshere on one side. The brake booster must be
open on the non-vacuum side. In a normal car, the open
side is inside the vehicle, no problem.
On a bus, it is underneath and exposed to the
elements, i.e. water. So, VW plumbed it up to the air
chamber in the door post.
