&gt; Tried the jumper trick on the starter, ignition switch on, and the starter

probably hit the wrong contacts, there are four on the end of the starter

      2  3
    1  
      4

this is looking from the front of the bus to the back.  # 1 will be the
hot contact with several wires attached including the big ones.
  connecting 1 &amp; 3 will spin the starter only
  connect 1 and 2 to kick the soenoid and the bus should crank

contact 4 has nothing on it ???

this is the automatic starter which is bigger so yours may be different
