&gt;  I agree with John on this.  However, IMHO a CHT gauge is far superior to
an 
&gt;oil temp gauge.  After all it's the exhaust valves and their seats that fail 
&gt;and it's the heads that crack and blow out their spark plugs.  

I don't disagree at all, but the investment is more likely to dissuade
people.  Oil temp is after the fact as Tim suggests but gives you
a good idea what you should and shouldn't do.

Anyone who wants to drive their '74 continuous at 79 mph all day
long, please do so.  You won't be with us very long.  Or you'll
be looking for an engine every 40k miles.  Of course like I said,
in Nevada (on a cool day) hell maybe just fine, my comments were
for my locale.
