&gt; Do NOT use undercoat on the inside of your bus. 3 reasons:

Well, some of us who decided that we were going to do a half-a$$ed version of
the G.M. Bulley soundproofing deal see better when looking backwards than we
do when looking forwards.  Maybe one could draw some sort of head-up-a$$
parallel there.

So, now that i've got a bunch of smelly sh!t smeared all over the inside of my
bus (btw - after sitting in the summer sun with all the windows open for a few
weeks, the smell almost completely went away.), i'm thinking of ways to combat
the potential stink.  

These are ideas, i haven't tried any yet.  If you're this far you can't turn
back, but definitely do not use 'tar paper' on top of the sealant; THAT stuff
really smells like a$$!



1. Before laying down anything else, coat all of the tarred surfaces with
baking soda, carpet deoderizer, or some other type of odor absorbing
substance.  Febreeze? 

2. Seal the tarred surfaces with something that will coat it and seal in any
'mean stinkies' that may want to escape.  Paint?  polyeurethane varnish?  Some
sort of silicone/rubber based sealant?

I would like some feedback on this too, if you can stop laughing at me long
enough to type one out. :-}

thanks,

-clark
