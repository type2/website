I am not sure it is the cold start. Another thing the shop forgot to do was
reconnect the cold start, but the bus started any way with me pumping some
gas into it via the gas pedal. Wish I was more experienced and could give
you a good lead. Good Luck!!

&gt; Hello All - 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm new to the list and immediately wished I'd checked it out earlier as I
&gt; did the exact same thing described below. Unfortunately, things are not yet
&gt; all OK, as I can't get the bus to start. It's a '77 2.0 liter FI, all hoses
&gt; hooked up, all electrical connections complete and grounded, timing done,
&gt; valves adjusted, new fuel, fuel pump operational, etc. The bus cranks fine,
&gt; starts to start, and just as I am congratulating myself, it dies. I suspect
&gt; the cold start valve, but I thought I would ask for suggestions before
&gt; beginning detailed troubleshooting. I recently acquired a VOM to test the FI
&gt; system, but I'm hoping it's something simple that I've missed. Any help
&gt; greatly appreciated.

&gt; I got the bus started last week and then had a major oil leak. I determined
&gt; it was the oil cooler. I did not have time to pull the engine and trouble
&gt; shoot - too much work/work. So I brought it to a local mechanic. Turns out I
&gt; put washers on the case side of the studs for the oil cooler. Rookie mistake
&gt; I guess - other wise everything seems OK.
