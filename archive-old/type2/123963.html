Subject: RE: [T2] Bench seat was cut out. Need advice. 

Chris,

I have two 76 buses and they both are 'walk through'.  'Walk
through' meaning that you have the ability to get up from the front
seat and walk in between the two front seats into the cargo area.  I
have seen 76 busses with a small removable stool that will sit
snugly between the drivers and passengers seats however.  To the
best of my knowledge, no North American 76 bus had a bulkhead that
went clear across the entire cab area, as was found on some early
splitty models.

  It appears to me that somebody partially cut on the drivers side
bulkhead.  I can't think of how to replace this cleanly without
either totally removing the bulkhead, or (and what I would prefer if
it was mine) going to a yard and finding a partially destroyed junk
bus, cutting the complete bulkhead out of the wreck and welding the
complete peice behind the drivers seat.  A body shop guy will have
more detailed suggestions and experience on this process.  On the
other hand, the location of the bulkhead, while keeping cargo from
smacking the driver in the back of the chair in transit, has the
unfortunate side effect of keeping the driver from letting his/her
seat back into a more reclined position.  Pick your poison....
