Subject: Re: [T2] 79' heat riser tube



&gt; I am looking for the right heat riser tube that connects the fan to the heat
&gt; exchanger. This varmit is a metal tube that is round on the bottom where it
&gt; connects to the heat exchanger but oblong on top where it connects to the
&gt; hose to the fan. apparently they made this different along with a lot of
&gt; things on 79's only. If any one has a lead on one please let me know. Thanks
&gt; in advance....Dana

I just compared a 79 Cal pipe I have laying around next to 3 72-74 pipes.....all
the same.
