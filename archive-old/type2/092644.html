Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Flow

I would verify the float level, and all other base adjustments on the carb, 
even on a new carb, before I ever install it the first time. Carbs do not 
suck fuel into the float bowl in any case. Don't be concerned with air in 
the filter. Verify volume and pressure at the carb inlet.

&gt;I have been having some idle problems on my 71 westy,  I have changed to a 
&gt;new carb, new fuel pump, and ruled out any vac leaks. I put on a new clear 
&gt;fuel filter, and I can see that
&gt;the fuel filter is being sucked dry at times.  The fuel line is not clogged, I
&gt;confirmed this.  Rather it seems that gas is not being sucked into the carb.
&gt;ANy suggestions about what may be going on?
