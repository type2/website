Subject: Re: [T2] Rap on Distributors #2 (Jose's bus)

Are you talking with the engine in or out? If its in, its easy, just leave
it in gear. The pully dosent really want to walk very much anyway, it just
needs something to overcome the taper. If its out of the car, then buy a
crankshaft lock, they're only a couple of bucks. The crank puller is a good
investment too, I've read and done the 'walk' it off procedure and it can
take forever.

&gt; This is kind of off the subject of what you were discussing, but, It is
&gt; kind of on the subject...
&gt; What is the procedure involved in replacing the crank pully? I know the
&gt; whole pull the bolt and then use a puller to get it off, but as for
&gt; holding the engine still while removing the bolt and so on how do you do
&gt; so? And are there special things to watch for?

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The second bus I looked at was also an early (68-70) bay, owned by a
&gt; member of the FMBC, named Jose. He had no initial complaint, he was just
&gt; generally worried.
&gt;
&gt; The history as I got it was that the bus had been sitting for quite a
&gt; while and he had just pulled it out of the weeds and gotten it running.
&gt; Good job, Jose!!!!!
&gt;
&gt; Checked his dwell, which was within limits (~46 as I remember) and
&gt; timing, which was also OK.  He had a stock pulley, which had two notches
&gt; and it lined up with the one I remember as being the 7.5 VOR notch, so
&gt; if he has hte right puley, his timing was fine.  I recommended, as I
&gt; usually do, that he get degree wheel pulley.
&gt;
&gt; Note on pulleys: VW put so many different pulleys on engines, and so
&gt; much swapping has gone on, that at this point the cheap, sleezy looking
&gt; &quot;billet look&quot; degree wheel pulleys are really the only way to go :-(  I
&gt; hate them for appearances sake, they are truly non-stock, but I no
&gt; longer trust any pulley to report facts to me.  Bummer :-(
&gt;
&gt; Lastly, his fan belt was as loose as a politicians tongue, which is not
&gt; a pretty sight on the podium and worse in the engine bay of a bus.  All
&gt; standing around agreed this was a &quot;bad thing&quot; and I am hoping he
&gt; replaced it soon (he had a new one in the bus)  I believe the reason it
&gt; was lookse was that  his pulley was &lt;euphemism&gt; quite rusty &lt;/euphemism&gt;
&gt; from sitting as lng as it had.  If it were mine, I'd have sanded the
&gt; heck out of the groove with some 220 grit sandpaper bfore installing the
&gt; new belt.
