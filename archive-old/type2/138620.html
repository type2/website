Subject: Tow Bar -- shipping ideas?

I have shipped an exhaust system thru my local UPS store by wraping it ( the 
individual pipes ) with shrink wrap found at the local Home Depot , and then 
wraping it again with duct tape. I did not have to box it but they did take 
the overall size into consideration for the shipping price. You can go to 
UPS_dot_com and then go to shipping to calculate the cost based on the weight 
and size to ship from one zip to another. Give me the size and weight and 
the 2 zips and I could figure out what it would cost you thru UPS. Cree
