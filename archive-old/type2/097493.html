Dan's Diecast Children's Charity Custom VW Bus Set!

Dan's Diecast is proud to offer a unique set of custom VW buses! Net proceeds
of the sale of these buses will be donated to two prominent childrens
Hospitals: Childrens Hospital of Wisconsin and the Childrens Hospital at UCLA.

The Children's Hospital at UCLA has received a great deal of attention lately
for the successful operation separating the 1-year-old Guatemalan twin girls
joined since birth at the tops of their heads. The Childrens Hospital of
Wisconsin, which is one of the premier childrens hospitals in the country, has
treated my 4 year-old daughter a number of times, including treatment for a
kidney disorder when she was an infant.

This set consists of 4 buses plated in different metals and finishes: Antique
Copper, Antique Sterling Silver, Antique 24kt Gold and Bright 24kt Gold.

Much time, effort and resources went into producing this custom bus set. Each
bus was first stripped, lightly polished*, pre-plated in bright nickel then
plated in either copper, sterling silver or 24kt gold. To achieve the antique
finish, a black nickel over-plate was applied and then brushed away to expose
the underlying metal, leaving some black nickel and creating a very unique
brushed antique finish! A clearcoat was then applied to preserve the finish.
You must see these in person to truly appreciate the beauty of these pieces,
each is a custom limited edition, individual work of art! (The bright 24kt
Gold version did not go through the antuiqing process).

Each custom bus is individually packaged in an acrylic case and black box. The
box is sealed with tamper proof hologram seals that tear if removed. Comes
with a numbered certificate of authenticity, the number on the certificate
will match the number on the box. These buses have hard plastic 5 spoke chrome
racing wheels in front.

hologram seals

following:
  a.. 1500 Antique Copper
  b.. 1000 Antique Sterling Silver
  c.. 500 Antique 24kt Gold

The buses with the plastic front wheels are available individually or in a set

*Polishing was successful in removing many factory defects from these casting
but in some cases the defects were not totally removed. You may see some minor
scratches, mostly on the roof area. Plating tends to exagerate these defects
whereas painting covers them up. This is why these types of scratches are not
noticeable on painted models of the same casting.
