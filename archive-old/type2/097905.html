Anthony,

There is also an &quot;exact replacement value&quot; insurance rider you can add
to any policy, to cover the vehicle as well as the added
contents--do-dad's and gizmos.
The only problem here is nobody wants to pay the piper for what it will
take to cover their vehicle completely--or for what it's replacement
value might be.
Usually only what is required, at the best price they can get--just to
get by--and this is what happens in the event of a loss---

In life I have found you only get what you pay for--and in this case I
can see what happened--or what might happen.

Later,

Terry

My 
VDO gauges, stereo, and likely the entire engine, will be waiting for a
new 
home. That's where all of my money is anyway.

Careful with collector's/antique insurance...Some only allow you to
drive a limited number of miles per year, and then only to &quot;events&quot;.
