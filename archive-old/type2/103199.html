&gt; Bentley(ch. 8 p.24 sec 8.2)reccomends using a wheel puller. Any good tool
&gt; rental place should have one.

I still can't see how one could get a wheel puller on a late bay drum.
The rear perimter is covered by the backing plate and the studs are
attached to the hub, not the drum.  The &quot;remove the big nut&quot; trick works
well, but don't give up on getting the drum off by hand.

The ususal thing that sticks is the center hole of the drum, as it is a
very tight fit and a bit of rust will stick it good.

Apply Liquid wrench to the hole and try twisting the drum back and forth
as well as rocking it in and out in all directions.  If you can get _any_
motion at all, keep at it and the motion will increase until it finally
comes off.  Of course, there are a couple of bolts (usually missing) that
fasten the drum to the hub so make sure that those are off.

I usually pull the drum off every time the wheel is off to do a quick
check of the shoes and cylinders as well as keeping the drum free on the
hub.

Pity that VW didn't put a couple of threaded holes in the face of the drum
to allow us to insert a bolt to push the drum off.
