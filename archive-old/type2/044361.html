Subject: [T2] Prime time?

Hi all -

Well, I'm nearing (much more confidently, many issues aside) the point where 
the rebuild is ready to go back in.  My question:  once it's in there, what 
do I do w/it? ;)

Do I need to prime this thing? - what about the FI?  Another thing:  I've 
replaced all the FI injector hoses and the hoses running off of the fuel 
lines w/new, FI-rated, hose.  Do I need FI-rated hosing from the tank back, 
or just from the pump forward?

TIA, and I'm sure some hose connection questions will be coming your way 
soon.  On that note, if anyone has a vacuum hose diagram, in an e-mailable 
format, for an '80 Westy, would you PLEAE (!!!) send it to me?

Thanks much,

Mark
