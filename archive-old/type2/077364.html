Subject: Busted accel. cable/pedal?

Hello to all you good folks-

Having just moved out into the New Mexico desert, my garage was/is full of 
stuff, thusly the bus is out in the cold. Had a good, cold morning, and 
apparently my accelerator pedal froze up. Gave it a kick and it came unstuck. 
Next morning, it did the same thing and the kick smacked it down to the floor. 
There is now perhaps only 1 inch of play, and the vehicle will not turn over 
without the punch of gas in the morning. Help! What could I be looking at 
here, and can I do this myself. I'm a newbie owner and I really do not want to 
tow this guy into the city. BTW, 1971 Campmobile.

Regards
Joshua Hinson
