Subject: RE: [T2] Distributor drive gear backwards...NOW WHAT??

I can't imagine it would hurt anything, but it would make troubleshooting 
other things later on more difficult.

Correcting it is easy and only takes a couple of wrenches. Just make sure to 
mark the true #1 cyl TDC for the dizzy (where the rotor SHOULD point). 
Bently et al show how to identify the #1 cyl in the dizzy to make sure you 
got it right.

So is it OK to live with it like this for
a while, will it run with the plug wires in this order
without problems or damage? OR is this a situation
(the dizzy drive gear) that needs to be corrected
right now? If the latter, exactly what is involved in
making the dizzy drive gear right? What special
tools\skills does one need to accomplish this task??
Can it be done without tearing into the engine??
