&gt;Now, Chris, think of all the money you'll save using a reel mower...No 
money wasted on either gas or paying to work out at a gym (a concept I've never
quite understood... ;-(&gt;

True, so true. And environmentally friendly too... &lt;grin!&gt; 

&quot;Hey, somebody call an ambulance. There is an weird white guy over here that had a heart attack cutting his yard with an antique mower....&quot;

...weakly...

&quot;...I'm not weird...&quot;

&quot;...and I'm not dead yet!...&quot;

&lt;knock on head with stick&gt;

Chris

I've wanted (for several years now) one of those old GE electric lawn tractors. Supposedly has pretty of juice for a 2 acre yard and there were dozens of electric attachments including a welder. I'm tired of the B&amp;S racket. Now adays I have a tiny yard and trees so a reel mower would be perfect.
