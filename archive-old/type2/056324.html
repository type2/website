Subject: RE:  Compression with engine out?

&gt;I was wondering, can I check my compression with the engine out of 
&gt;the bus?  I don't see why not if I turn the flywheel.

The problem is that the combustion chambers are not sealed units.  So as
you compress the air in there, it starts to escape past the rings.  The
slower you turn the engine, the more air escapes as it is being
compressed so you will get very low readings (if any at all).  I don't
think you'd be able to turn the engine fast enough and smoothly enough
by hand to get any kind of accurate reading.

If you bolt up a tranny and mount the starter, you'd be OK.

Actually, this brings up an interesting question.  Would your
compression numbers change drastically if you actually STARTED your
engine on 3 cylinders with a compression tester screwed into the 4th
one?  Just musing...
