Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum Idle Retard connection - 71 DP

&gt; Also, the engine has an aftermarket exhaust.  Hence, the pre-warming 
&gt; tubes, or whatever the connection from the muffler to the intake manifold 
&gt; is called), doesn't line up very well.  Could this connection be causing a 
&gt; vacuum leak that could manifest itself by stalling?

if your refering to the manifold preheat connectors (which you probably are, 
these dont line up even with stock exhuast very well) This could cause a 
little back fire on back pedaling the throttle if the exhuast leak is 
signif. That's it really.
