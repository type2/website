Subject: [T2] Help!  Smoking turn signal!

Hi-  I need some help.

If I use my right turn signal, all of the lights, radio, everything pulses
with every flash.  There is also an acrid smoke emenating from the dash.
I'm afraid to take right turns.

It seems like something's shorting out, but I can't find any obvious
culprit.  Could it be the relay or am I barking up the wrong tree?

I'd really appreciate the help.  Please pmail as I am on digest these days.

Thanks,
