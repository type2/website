Subject: Re: [T2] what are the going rates for 23 window busses

Thats the going rate for a 21 window. 23's are usually a little more. Check
out the classifiieds on The Samba for a better idea. Ive seen perfectly
restored 21's on there for over 30k. I don't know what they finally sold for
but they are selling. http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/index.mv?view+5+sum

&gt; condition 23 window busses.  there is one for sale in
&gt; boulder and the guy is asking 25 grand.  seems a
&gt; little steep to me.
