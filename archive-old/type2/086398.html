Subject: RE: [T2] horn and brake lights are linked

Ok I'll jump in,

The ground wire comes up through the column to just underneath the horn
button on the other end it is attached to one of the securing screw for the
steering coupler. The ground wire from the horn is actually attached to the
steering column cover, what you hit your knees on getting in. Underneath the
trim plate on the floor is a male electrical connector that this wire plugs
into. The trim cover is shielded from grounding the column cover by a
plastic grommet where the column pokes through the floor. If the male
connection end and or the plastic grommet are missing or damaged your horn
can short i.e. beep beep. Then the horn button could need some attention
also. When removing the horn button carefully pry up on the black plastic
only not the metal ring seen around the edge. You can find a decent
illustration our web site under front axle steering then steering wheel
column. I hope this helps with the beep beeps.

&gt; &gt; Years ago I had a 72 bus that sounded the horn whenever I hit a bump in
&gt; &gt; the road. It was the source of much amusement for passengers, including
&gt; &gt; the beautiful lady I eventually married. I tried, but never figured it
&gt; out.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; For one day, my Vanagon decided to alert everybody that I was making a
right
&gt; turn, by beeping the horn just one short beep each time I turned.  Before
I
&gt; even had a chance to look into it, it stopped on its own accord.
&gt;

My sc did the (big)bump thing for a few weeks then the turn thing for a few
miles before the horn just starting blaring and didn't stop until I crawled
under and yanked the wire.
