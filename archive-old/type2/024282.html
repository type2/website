&gt; So what is the proper greeting?  Loafers?

  ... or maybe &quot;Volks&quot;?  :-)


&gt; My review of the archives suggests that up to 1300 lbs or so is do-able with
&gt; a 2.0l spec motor but little is said about speed or reliability on the
&gt; earlier ones

   I havn't looked into towing so I'll take your research as read.

&gt; (have seen the 78 manual jpegs).  Can anybody (especially a
&gt; racer) share info on this issue?  I have an opportunity to buy a 74 westy,
&gt; might run (no keys but title), needs canvas and an interior but not rusty.
&gt; I'm wondering
&gt; 
&gt; - what the chassis is worth (driving cabin immaculate, camper end home made
&gt; and rough, start again)

 No idea, sorry. A few hundred dollars?

&gt; - if there is anywhere that I MUST not find rust (I remember it as fairly
&gt; clean)

 The chassis(!). Under the windscreen is a bit of a pain, but doable.

&gt; - if 70 mph on the interstate is suicide or even obtainable.

 In a stock '74 it's doable on the flat with no headwind, but you'll
have little in reserve. If you put in a good 2.0 litre engine (that is,
a 1970cc pancake with FI) you will have some power in hand but will still
struggle on grades or into the wind. Your engine should be reliable, though
you'll obviously be putting more strain on it than if you wern't towing. I
would expect it to have a slightly shorter life, and to need close
attention to proper cooling etc.
 If you keep under the maximum train weight as per the manual then you 
shouldn't kill the bus, but you won't see great performance.
 You either need to adjust to a more sedate pace of travel, do some serious
(and expensive) modifications or give up on the bus for this application.

 That all sounds a bit negative... I suppose it is, inasmuch as I'm saying
that towing 1300lbs behind a '74 at 70mph is probably not realistic. On
the other hand 60-65 should be sustainable, both in term of performance
and longevity: if you can allow an extra ten minutes or so for each 
&quot;hour's drive&quot;  to your destination then you'll be cool.

Hope this helps.

Cheers,
	W.
