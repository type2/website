&gt;My plan is also to paint the wheels... but I'm not sure what color to paint them,

&gt;If you go to this link: &quot;http://community.webshots_dot_com/photo/70738428/89372699aGjshT&quot;

Can't view it.

&gt;Can anyone tell me what color my wheels SHOULD be colored? I've already painted
&gt;one of them in Arctic white, but I don't know how well it fits. I'd just like 
&gt;to hear from anyone who may have an idea of what is normal / original for a
&gt;73 Bus like mine. 

Here's a factory steel wheel that was mounted to a spare that sat in the westy wheel cupboard for 20 years:

The finish is satin like.
