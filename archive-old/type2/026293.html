&gt; My question for the day is:  Are Vanagon's geared *way* lower, is this
&gt; engine *way* more powerful than I think, or am I dreaming???  The pads are
&gt; out of the (metal) lid and the rear cushion is still sitting in the
&gt; garage, so there may also be an exageration of the sound, but...  I tend
&gt; to shift &quot;by ear&quot; and my ear is telling me to shift about a 10-20 mph
&gt; lower in this new van than in my loaf.  
	[Crick, Bill]  I suspect very much you are used to shifting by
volume, not RPM .
&gt;  I've noticed that whenever I drive my van without the customary two
&gt; sleeping bags over the rear deck, I'm always
	thinking it is about to blow up, and there is something wrong with
it. If you want to try this, try driving with the inside engine
	hatch off, and you'll find you are afraid to push teh gas more than
half down, 
	becasue its always time to shift before you get it there;-)
	I've also noticed this when moving from my 84 Tercel with the
windows open to tour Air Conditioned 95 Carmry. 
	If I don't watch it, I tend to shift at way higher RPM than I intend
to, even though normally both cars should be shifted at about the same RPM.
I also tend to come onto the freeway at about 15-20MPH faster than I intend
to and have to brake to match speeds to merge onto the highway;-)
