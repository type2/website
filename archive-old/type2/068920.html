&gt;I'm taking a day off tomorrow to drive the 400 KM to Toronto to visit a 
&gt;VW remanufacturing plant.   It deals with engines.  I discovered rebuild 
&gt;stickers on the engine I found in the 73 part van, called the plant and 
&gt;they invited me to come down and have a look!  So, I am.
&gt;
Hey Barry I would relly like to hear all about the plant and the visit.
Specially since I am in Toronto every day. Can you post all the
details...and some sample prices?
