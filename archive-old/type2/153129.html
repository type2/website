Subject: turn signal switch is a lightbulb!

went round a corner today; hmm, why do i  hear the geblinker box 
geblinking still? and why is pretty smoke curling up around the turn 
signal switch? even better, how did a LIGHTBULB get in there?

*sigh*

pulled over, unscrewed t/s housing. every time i turned the key on, 
the flasher relay starts up, and a VERY bright lightbulb glows in 
time with the blinker box's clicking. the smoke seems to be from 
grease burning off the 'lightbulb.'  by the side of the road, it 
appeared that a t/s return spring was glowing like the filament  of a 
lightbulb every time the blinker box clicked... specifically, it 
looks like the forward spring.  it could also be a wire, but i  won't 
know for sure until later when i have time to poke at it.

i eventually had to pull the farthest-right fuses to be able to drive 
the car - not sure if both were neccesary, but my diagram for the 
fusebox simply showed 'horn/blinker/wipers' so i kept pulling till 
desired result :P

so, two questions: assume the spring is passing current and glowing; 
what is the likeliest path? and two: which scenario makes more sense, 
the spring breaking, shorting to a hot wire that starts the blinker 
box going; or the blinker box having a problem that makes some weird 
circuit in the switch housing, thus making the -whatever-  light up. 
i'm leaning towards #1, myself......
