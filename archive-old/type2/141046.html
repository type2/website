Subject: Re: [T2] Since the trip to Cali is off...

What's the best time of year to do a tour of Colorado in my bus? Too many 
tourists in the summer sucks. Too much snow sucks. I want to drive up Mt. 
Evans and all over. What month would the CO listees recommend?

&gt; I second the drive to Estes Park.  Although not in the bus, we drove 34

&gt; mature evergreen standing about 2 feet tall  :)

It sure is a beautiful drive, and I can let you know that a bus can
make it. We took that drive in the 66 LOADED down with 6 people and a
trailer. Talk about no power!!! ;)
