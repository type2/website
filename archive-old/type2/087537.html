Subject: Re: fuel sender replacement

&gt;Hey,
&gt;has anybody done the replacement without pulling the engine, like the arc=
&gt;hives suggest.
&gt;The guy says to cut a hole in the body to access it and re cover it with =
&gt;a plastic screw on boat hatch.
&gt;sounds risky to me, but I'd like to know for sure how much gas I have, th=
&gt;e needle drops to R after I have a half tank or less.

do it do it cut the muthah. nothing risky here - do a one-inch circle to
see where you're at and make it a larger square soonafter. i'd pop rivet
with a larger piece of matching donor metal - soften the edges first, and
tape them over afterward so nothing rips fabric or a mat.   - steve
