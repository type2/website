Subject: New ECU's for $99!!

I just obtained a closeout on brand new, still-in-Bosch-boxes, Bosch rebuilt
Electronic Control Units (ECU's) for '76-78 fuel injection.  These units
normally sell for about $500 plus core deposit.   I have them for $99.95
each (plus shipping), with no core deposit.

I have four versions.  While they are fairly specialized in original
application, according to my rebuilder they actually can be used on a wider
range of models.  For example, most of them are for auto trans and/or for
California emissions busses.  However, my rebuilder says that they consider
them interchangeable with models with manual trans and with non-California
busses.  They tell me that between the different variations (within the same
year), only minor fuel mixture variations will occur if you enterchange
them - and this can be adjusted at the air flow meter anyway. So according
to them, a model listed as, say, &quot;'76-77 bus, auto trans, Calif emissions&quot;
would also work on a 49-state manual trans bus.  I am not an ECU expert and
cannot confirm this from experience, but the information was given to me by
somebody who is, so take it for what it's worth.

At the usual $500 price, most people don't buy these until theirs fails. But
for $99, it may be worth putting one in the garage in case of emergency.

Part numbers will be on the website tomorrow, or of course you can email, or
call toll-free 1-888-819-DEPOT to order by part number.
CU55X and CU56X:  '76-77 bus (manuf. date 1/76 on).  Listed applications
(see above) are auto trans, and Ca. emissions auto trans, respectively.
CU98X and CU100X:  '78 bus.  Listed applications are auto &amp; manual trans
respectively, both California emissions.  (Only 3 available of the latter;
on orders for the latter, the former will be substituted when the latter is
sold out.)

Quantities are very limited, and I will not have them again once they're
gone.
