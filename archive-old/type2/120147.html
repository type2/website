Subject: RE: [T2] Check Condenser

&gt; I was going to ask a similar question!
&gt; I have had two condensers fail on me.
&gt; On the beetle (1600tp) a few years back it cause erratic timing and back
&gt; firing. As usually it was the last think to check/replace and all was fine
&gt; after that.
&gt; In the last week I have had intermittent problems on my bus (2L dual carb). It
&gt; would run fine and then completely die, usually after ~1/2 hr driving. I'd sit
&gt; and tinker for a while and everything would be fine after that even though I
&gt; never found the problem.


I put my bet on it being the coil.
Personally I would get a spare coil and the next time it fails, swap it
and see.
cant go wrong carrying a spare anyway.
