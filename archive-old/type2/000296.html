The pistons are easy to simply blow out of the calipers with compressed air.
You don't need a huge commercial unit, just a little plug in the cigarette
lighter unit will do it.  When I rebuilt mine they were badly rusted in.  I
almost think better used ones might be able to be pulled out with determined
fingers after you coax them into the opening with a little pressure on the
pedal.  The trick is that you can only get one out at a time.  I made a
little clamp that holds one side in while the other gets pressured out.  Be
careful and ease the rubber boots off.  They cost, good ones are reusable,
and it took me several pairs to get ones that fit right.

Sliding the pistons back in is nothing, just keep them square.  I seem to
remember that there is an orientation that's important.  It's in the
manuals.

Take a brave pill and replace your steel brake lines while you're at it if
they look spooky.  You can buy straight pieces at any FLAPS (remember to get
metric), then field bend them with your sturdy thumbs to fit.  Don't destroy
the olds before you get the new ones made.  Can't go anywhere without those
lines in place.  Good luck and don't take any chances.
