The 71 bus used a BN4, not a BA4, so if the heater is from a stock 71 Bus
application, it is the former. I would recommend a BN4 in a bus over a BA4,
just because it a standard application and all the factory documentation is
there to support it, not to mention the &quot;kludginess&quot; of putting a BA4 in a
vehicle it was not designed for. The BN4 is a great deal simpler to boot.

Germansupply has a very good stock of new and used gas heater parts such as
control switches, glow plugs, fuel pumps, flame switches, safety relays etc.
