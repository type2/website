&quot;or you see 'mayonnaise' in your oil cap, you need to stick
&gt; w/ the program.&quot;

What is that mayonnaise? I never saw that in my 75 (1800) but the 76 I have
now with the
2 ltr always has that gunk on the inside of my oil cap?

PS - I found a &quot;REALLY&quot; cheap place to get VW bus parts :
www.bimmerparts_dot_com
You can one of those glovebox locks for about 12 bucks! Beats the 50 or so I
have seen them
going for. I found they averaged about 3 - 10 bucks less per part from even
some of the mainly bus part guys.

I should add I have zero experience with them, so who knows, maybe slow
shipping or bad customer service. I am putting in a order for all my brake
needs and will see.....

&gt;
&gt; &gt;As a closing thought I truly believe that people waste too much oil in
their
&gt; &gt;cars.  Any modern car is able to safely use its dino juice oil over 5000
&gt; &gt;miles.  To change oil at 3000 miles these days is a complete waste of
&gt; &gt;resources!  If you run synthetic in modern cars make it go 10,000-20,000
&gt; &gt;miles because it is safe to do so and increases your return on investment
&gt; &gt;due to the high purchase price.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;My food for thought of the day,
&gt; &gt;Adrian S. Pillow
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; well, yes and no... 'modern' car? yup. old vw? nope.
&gt; the case of a vw is readily eaten by water; one of the main reasons vw
&gt; specified its shorter oil change interval was to remove the water puddling
&gt; in the case from stop-and-go driving. if you are not doing a lot of
&gt; highway driving, or you see 'mayonnaise' in your oil cap, you need to
stick
&gt; w/ the program.
&gt;
&gt; not to mention the fact that nearly every vw i see on the streets
&gt; (including mine :P) runs overrich, thus diluting the oil quicker.
&gt;
&gt; one day i'll get me one O them european aluminum t1 cases, and GET that
10k
&gt; oil life :)
