&gt; &gt; I have read the Muir section on driving a bus and was wondering how many
&gt; &gt; follow that advice to the letter? It seems kinda nutty to drive in 3rd gear
&gt; &gt; above 45mph...in my '71 the engine sounds like it is turning to fast in 3rd
&gt; &gt; gear at 45mph...or is that just because I am use to driving jap cars?
&gt; 
&gt; 3rd gear above 45 is pretty reasonable if you are going up an incline
&gt; because you don't want to put too much load on the engine at low revs.  But
&gt; on the level or going downhill (unless a steep hill) I usually change up to
&gt; 4th about 35-40 and stay in 4th down to about 30.

FWIW the VW auto tranny should shift

up  1-&gt;2  18-24mph
    2-&gt;3  42-47

down 3-&gt;2 24-32mph
     2-&gt;1 14-16mph

gear ratio's are 
final drive  4.1
 1st gear    2.55
 2nd gear    1.45
 3rd gear    1.00   same as fourth in manual

this might give some hints as this is what VW considers the appropriate
shift points for the bus.
