Subject: vinyl repairs in cab

i scored a fairly nice vinyl cap for my bulkhead. only thing keeping me
from installing is whether i can repair the 15 hairline cracks ranging in
length from 1/2&quot; to 2&quot;. with installtion and no fix i have a concern of the
thin cracks may open and bleed foam. have we a difinitive vinyl repair used
on these types of caps, or dashboards?   - steve
