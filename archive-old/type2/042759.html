Hi all

Something weird happened last night, I was away on business and when I got
to my friends house where I parked my bus, (he lives close to the airport),
anyway it had been parked for 2 weeks and when I got in, it started fine but
when I placed it in gear it wouldn't move, felt like the parking brake was
on, but that hasn't worked for quite a while, so thinking the brakes had
seized we jacked up the right rear to test that wheel, it turned freely,
then we jacked the left rear and it also turned....  So I try again and now
I didn't have any problem at all....

Any ideas as to what was up with that????

Thanks

Erich
