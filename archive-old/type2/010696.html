Hello from Scotland fellow listees.
I was at the Scottish VW festival at the weekend and bought new 
shocks for the front and back of my 1974 Devon camper.  On opening 
the packet, I expected the shocks to have springiness/damping 
capabilities; no such luck! The shocks were at the most 
compressed setting while easily pulled up and down through their full 
travel.  Inside the box was a little insert describing how the shocks 
were to be &quot;activated&quot; by &quot;sliding the shock up and down several 
times to remove any bubbles etc&quot;.  Am I missing something???
Surely it would be increasingly difficult to move the sprung damper 
up and down by hand at the best of times and if the weight of my van 
is barely enough to bottom out these shocks how am I expected to do 
this??????? Yours slightly puzzled and hacked off
