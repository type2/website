&gt; Ok, recently there has been so much talk on tire size I am now
&gt; confused.  All I would like to know is the correct size which I can run

&gt; all!

The OEM size is 185R14 load range C.  No aspect ratio number like &quot;75&quot; in
the middle.

Some use 195/75R14.  This tire is a bit smaller in diameter than the OEM
size and a bit wider.  Wider is not good, IMO, as one of the weak points
of early bays is the steering box and wider tires require more effort to
turn, which can break the fragile box.  The load ranges for the 195/75 are
lower than those for a 185, so you must use a load range D tire in this
size.

The 195/75 size is much more common and tire stores will pressure you to
use it, since it's the tire they have in stock.  They'll say that the 185
size is &quot;obsolete&quot; and &quot;superceded&quot; by the 195/75 size.  Neither assertion
is true.  Find a different dealer.

The 185 size can be ordered by any competent tire shop.  It is made by
Bridgestone, so any Firestone store can supply them.  This size was also
factory supplied on 1-ton Toyota pickups, so buses aren't the only
vehicles in the US that use it!  Other manufacturers also make this size.
