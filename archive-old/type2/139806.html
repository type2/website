&gt; The local tire guys called Town Fair Tire (Connecticut and New England)... I
&gt; could be a little off on the price - they may have been more expensive.

hmmmm, wonder if they are old stock or maybe Michelin got enough call for
em to make some more.???   mine were over $500 for all 4 about 5 years ago
so would not surprise me if they were more expensive, but of all the tires
I've ever had on my buses (since 1970, not year of bus but year of
purchase of first bus) these Michelins were far and away the best tires
I've ever put on a bus.  YMMV
