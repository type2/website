&gt; if you don't mind, why did you say &quot;thank Jah&quot;?=A0 Please forgive my
curiousity...

Michael,

Good question.  The roads were incredibly steep from the Mexican/Guatem=
alan
border on the way to Panajachel.  Even in first we couldn't make it ove=
r
all the peaks on the first shot.  The motor got hotter with each increa=
sed
pitch, and the more we drove the worse the situation became.  My van wa=
s a
'71 old rusty bucket with a known problem staying cool.  We just took o=
ur
time, stopped frequently and 'read' the motor as much as possible.  I s=
till
to this day can't believe we made it all the way from Canada to Guatema=
la
with that old van - and made it back home too.  We probably almost died=

several times, but I loved every minute of the travels.  Also, our
unexpected stops let us meet very nice people all along the way.  Stran=
gers
from all different places welcomed us into their homes, giving us home
cooked comida, showers and a chance to meet locals from everywhere.  Ah=
,
that was fun.

Regards,
Shawn
