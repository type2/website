Subject: clutch pedal breeze!

*smile*

    I think this will become a fart BUT..... The &quot;gasket&quot; that fits around
the opening in the floor at the clutch pedal isnt flush and moreso sits just
outside of the cab. I feel a little draft spilling in through this hole and
was wondering if anyone has ever devised some sort of &quot;boot&quot; like a shifter
style boot to go around the rod from pedal to floor. Some sort of rubber
vinyl  type?
also.... My headlight problem (embarassed) was due to a sticking ignition.
When the weather turned cold my ignition didnt want to spring back all the
way after starting. It took me a lot of tedious testing and trouble shooting
of all my connections (if you recall it was the wipers and headlights that
wouldnt come on in cold weather, only after about 15 minutes of warming up)
to finally crawl up back into my pilots chair and say &quot;SCREW IT!&quot; and turn
off the engine, only to see the headlights flick on for a brief second. hand
on the key i turned it slightly forward and they came on again. then I
started Blue up and noticed I could pull the key back a fraction or so, then
the beams popped on. I feel great at not being stranded anywhere at night
now. I also feel foolish for leaving Blue at work for two days because I
didnt want to drive at night with no lights. Little prob little fix big
headache.
We now have a stronger bond! :)
Thnx all!!!
