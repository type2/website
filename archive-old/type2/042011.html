&gt; I did a quite lengthy measurement of my mpg about 3 years

 Yes, I've found this, too. During the span I'm reporting I saw values
from 18.5 to 22.6 mpg over a &quot;tankful&quot;.

&gt; but the long term smoothed average gradually got closer and 
&gt; closer to a
&gt; consistent figure - about 21.5 mpg imperial. 

 Yup, that sounds about right- I drive quite hard and am spending a bit
of time in traffic, which tends to bring my mileage down.

&gt; A variation of 
&gt; only 0.15 mpg I
&gt; would think is fairly insignificant, but time will tell.

 It's going to add up, I suppose. I thought it might be useful for others
to have this information, too.

&gt; I presume you have accounted not only for a variation on the indicated
&gt; speed, but also the distance, as the mileometer will also be 
&gt; out if the tyre
&gt; circumference has altered. 

 I am going by the rolling radius of the wheel (now 305mm, was 296mm) and
the revolutions per mile on the speedo.

&gt; I checked mine against motorway 
&gt; markers for 30
&gt; miles, and was surprised how accurate my recorded miles were, 
&gt; but I do have
&gt; stock wheels and tyres.

 I've tried this for short stretches and thought it was pretty close. My
wheels+tyres are nominally almost the same diameter as stock (659mm vs 
654mm) but the rolling radius is more different than this suggests because
of the stiffer sidewalls on the new tyres.

 I suppose the main point is that if this isn't taken into account you
could see some substantial economy variations that were artificially 
produced by a small tyre (I suspect that this is the case for some of the
numbers that have been posted to the list). If you want to improve your mpg
you can just let your nearside front tyre down (or fit Lo-Pros) and 
magically acquire another 5mpg :-).

Cheers,
