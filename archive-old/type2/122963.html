Subject: carb advice please

  Hey bussers,

  I am facing a dilemna on just what to do with my bus carbs.  I currently 
have a '74 1800cc engine with the stock dual carb set.  Both carbs are in 
serious need of being rebuilt renewed etc.  My mechanic has advised going to 
a single carb conversion due to our living conditions.  Because I live in a 
very wet, consistantly cool enviornment (Alaska), my mechanic says the very 
small power loss by doing this conversion will be easily made up for in 
reliability.  However, he no longer has a source of supply for these parts.  
Also he says there were a couple different brands, and that only one of them 
worked really well.  All I want is a good running reliable bus.  Please 
advise.  Thanks in advance.  Jamal.
