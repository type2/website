Subject: Re: [T2] Fake chrome, anyone?

Hiya John,

Judging by the picture you linked to, I'd say you have other, more important 
and pressing concerns than chrome.

But some background information for you might be in order.  In 1970 (and most 
likely other production years) the beltline chrome was actually polished 
anodized aluminum.  It was held in place by steel clips.  The anodization can be 
stripped from the aluminum.  At that point one has a choice of re-anodizng (a 
spendy little process) or opting to polish the aluminum on a regular basis.  I 
chose to go the &quot;Cadilac&quot; route.  I had the chrome stripped, polished, and 
reanodized.  Two years later it is still perfect.

I know of no good cheap replacements for original beltline trim.  Then again, 
I never opted to look.  On the other hand, I have seen trim pieces and entire 
complete sets of beltline trim for sale.  One complete set went for around 
$35.00US on e-Bay (quite some time ago).  The point is, the chrome pieces can be 
rounded up.  Besides e-Bay, there is always Ken at The Bus Company or Joe at 
Busted Bus.  Heck, Karl (aufever_at_prodigy) has every bus part imaginable too!  
I would recommend that you, at the very least, give these folks a call or an 
e-mail and see what they might be able to do for you.
