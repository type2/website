Subject: Shift rod bushings

OK finally have some time to attempt to put the engine back in the
camperbus. It's been quite a while.

Before I do, I need to replace the bushings on the shift rod that runs under
the bus. I had one new one but my shifter had 3 mounted on it. Two of them
have one hole for the bushing holder part to stick into, the other has two
holes. Can anyone help me with the part # I'm pulling off of the bus depot
page

211 711 179 is one of them. Is this the one for the single hole? If so I
need one more.

211 711 185B is this the one nearest the front with the two holder holes?

Any help would be great!
