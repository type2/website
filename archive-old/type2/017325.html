Leo,

I'll bet you come closer to 6k lbs than you think.  A Westy is heavier than my
ASI Riviera, and I drive across ODOT's scales every now and then.  Empty water
tank, no food, a minimum of gear, one human, no dog, half a tank of fuel, full
propane tank crosses at 4900 lbs.  Add a couple of humans, food, dog, full
tanks and the usual assortment of sundry items and I'll bet it's over the 6k
limit.  Go with the &quot;D&quot; rated tyres if you can afford them.  I run
LT27/8.50-14 &quot;D&quot; rated tyres at 50# all the way around.  Just air down when I
get on washboard roads.

&gt; Hello again!
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, thank you to those of you who responded to my original post.
&gt; I've narrowed down my search to 3 tires.  Because I want to stick with
&gt; 185R14 size tires (I don't want to subsitute them with 195/75R14 tires), I
&gt; find that I'm sort of limited to what's available out there.  By the way, I
&gt; think I'm safe to get C load range tires (vs. D).  C load range tires (in
&gt; 185R14 size) should be sufficient to handle up to a 6000 lb. load.  I don't
&gt; think I'll be loading up my 71' westy to make it exceed 6000 lbs.   So here
&gt; are the tires that I'm looking at (all are availalble at Tire Rack):
