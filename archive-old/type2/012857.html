&gt;&gt; &gt;???? I ran one as a spare engine for years, worked decently as a spare
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Oops Bob is right the 914 1.8 was L-jet wasn't it.  Well the 412 wouldn't
&gt;&gt; work.
&gt;
&gt;well it was from a 411/412,,, however I did use my 2L AFM and ECU.  but
&gt;injectors etc were the same

There you go.

Actually the injectors aren't strictly either, but they do work, probably
appropriate to have done so, and interesting thought for those who whine
about using a 2L L-jet on a 1700/1800 just use the lower flow injectors.
Same load characteristics and flow appropriate for the 1800, though it
occurs to me D-jet runs a bit lower ring pressure as well?

My initial point of course is that D-jet ran double breaker points to
trigger the injectors in the dizzy.
