Subject: Re: [T2] heater for bus?

If you read the specs carefully you'll note that the &quot;flue&quot; required is 1&quot;
in diameter.  It hardly qualifies as a &quot;smokestack&quot; a la Toonerville Trolly.

Some of our Pacific Northwest members have catalytic heaters in their
campers, propane powered and drawing combustion air from outside and venting
combustion products to the outside.  The installations are unobtrusive to
the point that they have to be pointed out to the curious.  Venting
arrangements are very simple and straightforward.  These are most often used
while the bus is stationary at a campsite, but can be run while the vehicle
is traveling.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  ??? it is 6000 BTU but at $379 you could probably buy a working VW gas
heater that would fit.  also I can see you now going down the road with a
smokestack (you did see that it needs one?) coming out the roof

buy a Eberspracher(sp) or a Wabasto they are designed for motor vehicles  &lt;&lt;
