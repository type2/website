&gt; &gt; &gt; Also does the VW vans have large splines on the outside of the

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have picked up a set of heavy torsion bars from a camper and would like
&gt; &gt; to put them into my deluxe (by serial number) bus that I use to haul
&gt; &gt; stuff.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   will they fit, and how do I determine which splines to use...only wanna
&gt; &gt; take this mess apart once.  (yes they are marked L &amp; R)
&gt;
&gt; They will fit, but the initial setting is a matter of guesswork.  You want
&gt; the ride height to be the same as the stock bus for handling concerns.

absolutely, want em only because I think I may be overloading the other
ones.
&gt;
&gt; If you adjust the camper bars per the camper specs in a deluxe bus it
&gt; will ride too high, since the camper is heavier.

well my bus has the &quot;HP-Bus&quot; low floor modification and is at least
several hundred lbs heavier than a stock deluxe

&gt; If you adjust the camper bars per the deluxe specs, the ride height will
&gt; still be too high , since the deluxe bars will twist more from the
&gt; unloaded position when load is applied.
&gt;
&gt; You therefore want to start with a trailing arm setting a bit less (in
&gt; terms of angle) than the Bentley specs.  Unfortunately, this still will
&gt; probably involve trial and error.

I was afraid of that, especially considering how much work is involved in
adjusting them...
