Subject: RE: IT RUNS! IT RUNS!!

&gt;I'm wearing a permanent grin today

...because I got high, because I got high, because I got high


&gt;In place of a floor jack, I created a hoist out of a pipe wrapped with rope 
&gt; put the pipe across the top engine hatch, run the rope thru a 4x4 tow 
&gt;strap around the engine, and turn the pipe with vise-grips and a pipe 
&gt;wrench to lift.

Shhh ... don't give out the secret, just come up with a catchy name for it 
and paint the whole thing some far-out color. Design a web page and sell the 
Super Lift (or whatever) for $79.95. Throw in a set of grungy old Vice 
Grips, er, &quot;locking pliers&quot; -- can't call em V.G. in the advert, or they'll 
want their cut.

&gt;I also had a few scary moments as I realized I forgot to tighten down the 
&gt;hose clamps on the fuel rails  wet hoses, bubbling fuel, drips on the tin.

No big deal. That's a very minor safety issue. Don't worry, I hear engine 
fires are extremely rare in these vehicles.


Once I got the engine started, it would idle but
&gt;die as soon as the throttle was open ...
Then it would idle and rev up, but wouldnt go past
&gt;2500 RPM

That sounds like most '79s on the road today!

&gt;
&gt;Valve adjust, foam engine seal install, switched power to CHT gauge (now 
&gt;its always live), and a second (auxiliary) battery complete the picture.

Houston to bus driver: You are cleared for liftoff.

Moral of this story seems to be that doing it yourself isn't just cheaper 
and dirtier, it's the only damn way to know it's done right. Which reminds 
me of the U.S. government's motto: &quot;We're not good, but we're slow.&quot;

Congrats!
Mick
