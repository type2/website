Subject: 1974 For Sale
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I've got a 1974 bus I need to sell (going to stick with my 65 bus and look 
for a Bug of similar vintage).  Located in North Alabama.  $600.  Photos 
available by e-mail.  Only things missing are two under dash kick panels, 
radio, air conditioning compressor and carpet for the cargo area.  Has rear 
seat and middle seat (2/3).  Still has original paint - red/white.  Does not 
run but engine does try to turn over.  Been sitting for 4 or 5 years.
