Scott:
Under that tin are lovely aluminum finned heat sinks cast integrally with the
heads. and lovely cast iron fins cast with the cylinders.
Probably the easiest thing to do is to make sure these are intact and working
the way the engineers designed them 30 years ago.Make sure there are no missing
pieces (hoover bit and engine compartment seal come to mind) and no fine crust
of dirt and oil insulating them from the cooling flow. Make sure you have the
proper fan and pulleys and belt and timing and mixture.
I doubt anything developed from the digital age will help much except in the
engine management area. (Knock sensors and motronic controlled injection and
timing would be nice!)

&gt; Here goes.
&gt; I am under the impression that there is a better material which could be
&gt; used to pull heat off the engines than the tin provided.
