Subject: RE: [T2] '72 Windshield Rubber? [Ron is the king]

Wow!

I too have genuine VW German seals but Ron's retail price is bellow my cost.

Three cheers for Ron Hip Hip Hooray, Hip Hip Hooray, Hip Hip Hooray.

If anyone has extra money to toss around we sell them as well for $34.95. Ah
heck make it $34.94 I am feeling generous!
