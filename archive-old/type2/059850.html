Hey Y'all,
  I have been triing to find out what kind of motor I have. Its the one 
that came with the 70 Bus but it is not a type 2 motor. It does not have 
the mounts for thr rear eng mount, it has the type 1 to type 2 adapter 
that mounts to the oil pump. The number begins with BZ and it has BRASIL 
on the side, so it is probably a replacement but I can find any 
information on these cases anywhere. Does anyone know what they are. 
Steven Howell, didn't you say that you had one of these in a car you 
got? (65 or 66?) What did you find out? I want to know if I should build 
this one or the AD case that is in my Bug, or try to get a type 2 case 
or even a universal case. Any sugestions? Which case would be better?
  This Bus will be around for a long time to come, and will see alot of 
miles so I want to invest my money into the best case for the Bus. The 
Baja Bug is just a toy now so the other engine will go into that car.
