Subject: RE: [T2] removing rusty shock sleeve from mounting bolt

That's funny, I was just reading through the technical articles at 
aircooled_dot_net and saw a mention of this exact problem. The author spoke of 
heat and a grinder to get it off...

I'm thinking a Dremel tool would work fine.

i attempted to put my new front shocks on today. the drivers side went on
fine.  the passenger side came off, but the metal sleeve on the lower
mounting bolt for the old shock is rusted onto the mounting bolt.

is it going to take some heat to get this thing off?
