Subject: Electrical problems in a '71 Westy
Date: Fri, 4 May 2001 21:18:57 -0400

Greetings all,
     I am getting my '71 ready to drive.  After today, I have low beam
headlights, front and rear turn signals, emergency flasher and interior dome
light working.  I also have a working fuel gauge (I think, it shows about
1/3 full, and drops to nothing when the key is off.)  My problem is the
instrument cluster lamps and the parking lights.  When I connect the
instrument panel lamps, the fuel gauge goes to FULL.  Also, when I pull the
light switch to the first position (parking lights), the fuel gauge goes to
FULL.  I am totally lost.  What could the problem be?  Please help, as I
need to start driving this bus Monday.
     Engine question.  My idle seems to fast and I think it is too rich.  I
plan to do the following, and in this order:
1- set point gap
2- set timing
3- adjust idle
4- adjust something so the fuel smell goes away.  (there seems to be a VERY
strong smell of unburned fuel in the
     exhaust--it must be running too rich, what do I adjust??)

Anyway, please reply directly to me (vwstuart_at_mindspring_dot_com).  I am on the
digest, and I need to get this info quick.

Thanks in advance,
Keep'em on the road,

Stuart Neil
