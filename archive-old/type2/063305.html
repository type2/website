Subject: Re: rear engine lid seal

&gt;I received the replacement rear engine lid seal and it came in 4
&gt;peices. It appears that it is the right circumferance, but
&gt;I don't see how it stays in. There is a groove in the seal that
&gt;is supposed to go in the metal lip. When I did this it stayed 
&gt;for a minute, but didn't seem very secure. Also some of the
&gt;4 peices will need a little trimming and I can't decide if

It doesn't really matter too much which goes over which.  You will need some
glue to hold them in.  Try 3M weatherstrip adhesive, which is what I ended
up using.  Don't ever plan on taking it out again! 

If ya wanna be real fancy, you can cut each piece at a 45 degree angle, and
then glue them together and to the body.  The original piece was one solid
piece, which is why you don't recall the over/under issue.
