I just talked to a mechanic friend, and he said that the wheels don't need
replacing, just the tires. So the stock wheels will stay on. I thought that
with all the rust the wheels would crumble, but he assured me that wheels
are a lot tougher than that, and I just need to scrape off the rust and
repaint and they'll be fine. 

So now I just need to know what tires to get. I'm getting really confused
about this. A read in the archives about someone who put passenger tires on
their westy and had a major blowout. The moral of the story was to never put
passenger tires on a westy, as they're not strong enough. Okay, so no
passenger tires. So I guess I go with light truck tires. I just know I'm
going to get in there and the tire guys are going to see right through me,
I'll be standing there saying, &quot;Light truck tires please&quot;, and there will be
a million choices and I won't know where to go from there. :)
