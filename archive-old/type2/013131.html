Subject: Brake Caliper Rebuild

Dear Volks,

I'm pretty sure this never got posted, so I'm re-writing and
re-posting.  If you've received this twice, my humblest apologies.

This weekend I'm looking at tearing down my brakes on my '71:
replacing all the rubber hoses, replacing pads/shoes as necessary,
adjusting the rears and flushing the system (shouldn't be too bad
as I just did it last August).  This is more standard/preventitive
maintenance than anything, as my brakes work just peachy, but
who knows the last time the hoses were replaced, etc.

All that said, I've got some caliper questions.  The rubber
dust-cover/boots that the pistons come through are all dry and
cracked on my calipers.  It seems like a good idea to replace them
so they don't fail on their own at some point, brakes being a good thing
to have in general.

So, the questions are:

1) Should I just leave the dust-cover/boots alone and not worry about
         the cracked rubber (i'm inclined to not do this, but...)...

2) If I'm taking the dust-cover/boots off already, should I just go ahead
         and rebuild the calipers as well?  They seem to work fine, but
         if it makes sense to do this, i.e. there's a limited chance of me
         breaking anything/causing heaps more work for myself, i will....

3) How big a deal is it to replace the boots?  I'm thinking it was 
relatively
         painless the last time I tried something similar ('79 Rabbit).
         Does rebuilding the calipers make this an enormous project?  The 
archives
         say no, but if I can save 2 hours and work on other stuff, 
that'd be
         great too...

Thanks!
