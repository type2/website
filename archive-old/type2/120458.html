Gee.....  this is what I have been saying all along
about stock VW cams!
 
&gt; The book does state that camshafts for automatic and
 manual trans engines *are* different ...but it 
 doesn't say how.
 
It is in the Bentley: automatic cams have a cast ring
on them. Why? No idea.  There is no way to distinguish
a solid cam from a hydraulic cam.
 
&gt; Sorry it wasn't all we wanted to know...maybe
 Richard or someone who talks to webcam a lot can   
just call them up and ask
  them(nicely)...after explaining that 1400 people    
would really like to know!
 
Not the best idea, an aftermarket cam maker 'only'
knows about their product. You will be trying to
compare apples to oranges. I went round and round 25
years ago with Crane and Crower about small block
Chevy cams and in the end, the best advice they could
give me was &quot;consult your local cam grinder&quot;! The
locals advice was &quot;try grind XYZ, all the boys are
having good luck with it this week&quot;!
Cams are a black ops subject. The best info about
lift, duration, and cam centers and how they affect
your engine out there is an old Isky catalog..... I
bought every available book on cams and they all said
'consult your local cam grinder' in the end.
