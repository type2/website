Subject: Re: [T2] Plugging oil galley

I don't want to be the only dunny on the list but I'd sure like to know;
why would you want to plug the oil galleys.?
The standard plugs don't seem to leak or present problems.

&gt; Has anyone here put threaded plugs into the oil galleys on a T4 
&gt; motor.
&gt; If so, what size plugs and how many?  I've got to pull the motor to
&gt; change some seals and would like to have the parts on hand first.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA,
&gt;
