Subject: why I drive a buses

'78 Westy  Two summers ago my two sons and I traveled from Yakima to 
Missoula, 
                Montana and back and spent 8 days camping for $150. We have a 
place to 
                camp at the Washington beach that costs us nothing.
'64 Double cab  I can't drive it without a smile coming on my face!  I think 
it's magical.

I like my squareback and dune buggy, but I LOVE my buses
