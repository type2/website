&lt;&lt; That's the earlier style 68-70 pressure plate, and through out bearing you
 &gt; have in there now.  Is it working well?

Hello list   The later style  is much better than the early ones.  The TOB  
clips will fall off.   There are super clips that have an eyelet loop that 
allowed you to wire the clip to the crosshaft, therefore keeping the TOB in 
place.  Have seen late style TOB  get stuck on the shaft ,so make sure you 
lube the shafts and tailshaft where the clutch disc slides.       Mark
