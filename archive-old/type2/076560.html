&gt;  I just went and looked at 3 buses for sale. All are pretty much rust free
&gt; and very repairable
&gt; 
&gt; 1. 68 pop top westy
&gt; 2. 68 high roof westy
&gt; 3  71 hardtop westy

all other things being equal I consider 
71 best type I engine bus
78 best type IV engine bus


but that is just my not so humble opinion

Bob
&gt; 
&gt; 2 of them have engines, all have trannys. Interiors pretty complete on all
&gt; of them. The high roof is the cleanest of the 3.
&gt;   No major rust on any of them. Will require minor body work if you want
&gt; cherry or make run and drive as is. 
&gt; 
&gt; owner wants to sell all three as a package, he also has 5 others coming up
&gt; for sale when these are gone, all 72 and later campers, coditions unknown at
&gt; this time.
