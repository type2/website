&gt; What is wrong with just using the key ignition starter and not unplugging

Will,

That depends on what you mean by &quot;anything&quot;  If you mean that you
disconnect one spark plug wire, unscrew the plug, screw in the gauge, and
crank away, then there is a fair chance the engine will start and run on
three cylinders which is really bad for the gauge, if nothing else.  If
you run the same scenario but take all four plugs out, then I have no
problem.  Truth be told, that is the way I usually do it, too, except i
use a remote starter, since i am usually working alone.

The discussion was on how to prevent the fuel injectors from firing.
Unplug the FI lead fromn the coil and the injuectors don't fire was the
answer.  Then the discussion turned to how to prevent the system from
pressurizing, in case you had a leaky injector.  The solution to that is
to unplug the double relay.  Both are &quot;in a perfect world&quot; sorts of
precautions... I *ought* to do that, but as with many others I am usually
in too much of a hurry/too lazy.  One day it will bite me, but so far I
have gotten away with it :-)
