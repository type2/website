Got new shoes for Xmas from the bus depot!! Today I began to change the old
one's and put them on when I hit a problem. The hand brake lever on the old
shoe does not seem to have the clip on it. So I can not remove the lever
from the old shoe. Were some shoes manufactured so that the hand break lever
was *not* removable? Can I get just the levers? Can I replace the shoes with
out the levers and drive with not emergency brake (for now)? Help
