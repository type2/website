As far as I know VW was the only &quot;officially condoned&quot; camper conversion up until 1995 when the 
Winnie conversions :( came out.

FWIW everybody and their brother has taken a stab at converting VW vans into &quot;campers&quot; ( ihave 
seen anything from plywood screwed into the walls on up, and including shag carpet too ;) but that 
doesn't necessarily mean that VW &quot;approved&quot; of them. Most of VW objections to aftermarket 
conversions had to do with these companies cutting holes inthe roof for pop top's and the like and not 
(in VW eyes) making enough concessions to the ensure that the structural integrity of the van was 
maintained after the pop top was installed
