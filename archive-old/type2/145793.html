&gt; hey guys   The gas heaters for single cabs mount if the front right in
&gt; front
&gt; of the passengers feet and knees.    I have one mounted under my middle
seat
&gt; in my 66 westy and it has worked great for many years   These heaters were
&gt; also
&gt; mounted inside on the snow cats . You just need to protect  around the
&gt; heater

&gt;
&gt;    Years ago I had a 68/69 that had the heater mounted there...As well as a
cleanly
installed squirrel cage fan in the heater duct under the floor...Looked
&quot;factory&quot; and
was run by a switch on the dash...All this on a passenger Bus...
