Subject: Re: [T2] 1.7 Type 4 in a pre 1972 bus?

&gt; I have read that this was an option in all models except trucks. Anyone ever
&gt; seen such a bus? Would love to know what the tin looked like. Anyone ever
&gt; put a Type 4 motor in a 1968 to 1971 bus (excluding the type4 upright
&gt; conversion kit with the Porche 911 fan set up)?

I once parted out a 1969 Westy imported from the USA. Somebody had put
in a 1700cc engine type &quot;V&quot; (that's an engine fitted in the 1969 VW
411). The engine obviously didn't fit in the engine compartment. On the
left and right side pieces of sheet metal were cut away and so was a
part of the rear sheat metal (I mean the part that is fixed under the
engine lid, you have to screw it off when you remove the engine). It
looked very ugly.

The Dutch brochures I have say that the type 4 engine was not available
on pickup single cab and crew cab. But...the VW microfiche print I have
which deals with all the T2-models produced says that type 4 engines
were indeed available on pickups. I have never seen one though.

Just like I have never seen a T2 with 1300cc engine.

The type 4 engine was introduced in the late sixties on the VW 411 (also
known as &quot;type 4&quot;). It was first fitted on T2's in august 1971 with the
start of the 1972 modelyear.
