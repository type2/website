Subject: Re: [T2] 1974 VW Bus

Personally, I would automatically replace all fuel lines and the fuel pump.
Then make a note in a maintenance log regarding the date and mileage when
you did this. These should be replaced periodically, at least every two
years, in my opinion. What's the cost of a fuel pump and a few feet of line,
compared to an engine?
I just rescued my husband in our '71 (that is, one of our THREE '71's, LOL)
and brought him home, leaving it safely parked, then came back the next day
(60 miles, round trip) with a new mechanical fuel pump. We weren't taking
any chances. We replaced that sucker, and changed the oil, too.
My hubby is a good bus-lovin' husband and keeps his eye on those bussies..
Good man! He caught this problem just in time. The perfectly good-looking
fuel pump had developed a small hole in the diaphragm and was dribbling fuel
into the crank case oil, following down the path of the fuel pump rod. The
oil already smelled slightly of gasoline, and the oil level had raised
slightly. Again, he really watches this stuff. He took it out at lunch hour
and it started running a little rough. He went back to look and noticed air
bubbles siphoning into the fuel line.
That gasoline will make your oil like so much water, and the bearings will
burn up. A good engine can be toast in a very short time when gas gets into
that oil.
These fuel pumps only last about two or three years now, just like the
lines.. today's fuel eats them up, and when the lines and membranes in the
fuel pump dry up, then you put that fuel to them again, look out! They crack
and split. This is where a lot of engine fires happen, right there!
