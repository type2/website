&gt;By the way I cannot find too many sodium filled valves for sale on

They are available but expensive.

&gt;With improper clearance, valve should stop stretching
&gt;(won't sit, stem not in tension) but, yes, it can burn if run too long in
&gt;that state.

I think the valves will continue to stretch as long as they are subjected to excess heat. They started stretching when the clearance was perfect.

&gt;With hydraulic, chances are valve will keep on streching
&gt;without burning (self adjustment, without signs of loss of power), but will
&gt;eventually break.

If the valve cools mainly through contact with the seat I'm postulating that the solid lifter will burn a valve much faster than a hydraulic valve.

Once the valve starts to stretch what are the options? At what point do you recommend the heads be removed to prevent catastrophic failure.

&gt;Well filtered oil is a must for hydraulic lifters.  Do not be cheap
&gt;on filter changes.

The secret of my success I would guess.
