Subject: Re: [T2] bus stereos / how much power??

&gt; I chose to drill a few holes in my dash using the same pattern and size as the
&gt; factory speaker that is in the center of the dash,,

Anybody notice the small black tweeters that chad had mounted to the sides
of his dash on his loaf sc at everybus? It was the one with the poptop
covered blue sleeping area constructed on the bed. he was voted rustiest
or most rottenest or something like that.
It was a very creative setup.
