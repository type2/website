Subject: Re: Valve adjustment

With TDC#1, adjust 1I, 1E, 2I, 4E. How do you know it's TDC#1? If 1I, 1E,
and 2I are loose!

One full turn later (TDC#3), adjust 2E, 3I, 3E, 4I

There's write-up in the library under &quot;quick valve adjustment&quot; (I believe).

I think this must be done only with stock or very mild cams. To see if yours
will work, adjust using standard method, then re-check using the two-step.
