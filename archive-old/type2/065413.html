I think its just too dang small. I'll admit that the exhaust isn't=20
hooked up right, but I had a new Carb and Distributor put on it when I=20
bought it. I'm not going anywhere near the mountains (I'm in Seattle)=20
without a new and bigger engine. And I don't want to spend any money on 

this engine when I can afford to go bigger.=20

I just called a Junk yard and I can get a full 20L engine, FI, Heater=20
boxes, wiring harness, blah, blah, blah from a running but smashed up=20
bus. Its' either a 76 or 77. I am going to look at it tomorrow.
they hadn't gone over it yet, but he said they check the compression=20
and all that kind of stuff as part of their once over.

Any tips on what to look for? Anyone in the Seattle area free tomorrow=20
and need to go to the junk yard?


Thanks,

&gt; &gt;I have a '77 Camper and a 1600 engine in it that a PO put in while=20

&gt; Yes, so what is the problem? I have learned that anxiety-provoking
&gt; acceleration (or lack thereof) is one of the *charms* of the VW bus.=20
&gt; Before
&gt; getting a bus, I thought my old Tercel was slow. What's the big 
hurry?
&gt; Perhaps you need more of a head start when you hit the freeway ramps=20
&gt; ;-). I
&gt; think the &quot;Don't worry, be happy&quot; philosophy is a LOT cheaper, too. 
Now=20
&gt; for
&gt; some _constructive_ advice: Maybe all it needs is a tuneup. Bad 
timing,
&gt; etc. has a BIG effect on engine performance. I'd try that before=20
&gt; investing
&gt; 3K in a new engine. Good luck,
