After months of stalling, and regular busy lives, my engine is finally 
rebuilt for my 71 westy. I am siked! I'm planning on installing it before the 
weekend's out. Wish me luck! The body work is within a days work of being 
complete. With it's own power I'll take it to be sprayed. A cheapie paint 
job, but a fresh coat nonetheless. Then I have to replace all the rubber, or 
at least all I can afford. Wow, a nearly &quot;complete&quot; project. Now if I could 
just get my Ghia done!!!
