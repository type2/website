Subject: Re: OPENED LETTER TO RIK, AND THE LIST.

Hello List:

    First of all, I want to thank all of my fellow members for their notes
of support, following my chastization by our Moderator. Truth is I broke the
list rules and should have been called on the carpet for it. I did, He did,
I apologize, He excepted. Issue over!
    Actually I would not have his job for all the 23 Window Deluxe in
Cameron Louisiana!!!! Well I don't think that town of about 35 lost soles
ever had a 23 Window Deluxe, but I still don't want the job!
    On a serious note.  Rik, I make this open apologizes so you will know I
am truly sorry for the off topic comment, and the smart arsk reply, it wont
happen again! I was just caught up with the news of the day, and forwarded
it before I had time to think about list rules.
    Keep up the very difficult work, and have a good one. I hope this will
put my part of this thread to bed.

Yours

Tommy

&gt; A very well written reply!
&gt;
&gt; Way to go!
&gt;
ETC, ETC, ETC.
