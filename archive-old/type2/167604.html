&gt; previous posts that i was guessing i had dropped an exhaust valve on

&gt; 105-110 psi each time.  so did #3.  #1 read 120 or so.  this looks
&gt; pretty good.  however, this does not help my hypothesis about a
&gt; dropped seat.  maybe its floating.  dunno.  after seeing these

not very likely floating on a 2,000rpm solid lifter engine

&gt; drive about one block from the trailer to my house.  she fired up just
&gt; fine but had no power under load and would pop, sorta like a small
&gt; backfire.

hmmm, this gives a hint, check your point gap and timing...
