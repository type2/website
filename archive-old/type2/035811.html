Subject: Re: Resurfacing/Reusing Lifters

Hi Clark -

David is correct when he writes:

&gt;I can't see how the lifter/bore relationship could be important...
&gt;I think it (wilson saying put old lifters back where they came from)
&gt;is simply to maintain the lifter-cam relationship.
 
The base of the lifter wears in a circular pattern that exactly matches
the cam lobe surface it rides on.  It's important to keep those matched
patterns together.  If you accidently 'mix 'n match', the wear on the
lifter base accelerates, causing the lifter and it's lobe to
self-destruct.  Bad.  Very bad.  If it looks like the lifters got mixed
up, have them reground.  They'll be like new and can be placed on any
lobe.  We use a place in Dallas, called NorFleet.  They're a large
industrial firm that specializes in camshaft regrinding/refinishing. 
Typically, they charge $2.00 per lobe and $1.50 per lifter.  For a VeeDub
cam and lifter set, you're looking at about $21.00.  This includes media
blasting, regrinding the wear surfaces to spec, micropolishing the cam
journals, and parkerizing.  Heckuva deal.  As far as the lifter/bore
relationship goes, the important thing is to have sufficient oil
clearance between the lifter and the bore walls.  If the lifter moves up
ans down smoothly in it's bore, then all is well.   HTH!
