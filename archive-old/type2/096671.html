Subject: Any suggestions part two

Need a little memory help here.  Checking the basic timing of this 2 
litre engine.  When we are at tdc (#1) which cylinder and valve do we 
check to see if this is the power or intake stroke?  (Which valve on 
which cylinder will have just closed? &gt;or opened&lt;)


Thanks for any help,

Steve Blackham
