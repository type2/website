Subject: Book with buying advice?

All,
I would like an opinion on which book, if any, is good for information on 
buying a Type 2 bus - things to look for / check etc.

The  &quot;VW BUS Custom Handbook&quot;  sounds as if it might be what I'm after or 
would &quot;How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive&quot; be a better bet?

Cheers,
Paul Matthews (Wanabus),
