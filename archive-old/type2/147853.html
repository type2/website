Subject: Free stuff in Northern Virginia

Hello everyone,

I am getting ready to move to Florida and I have been cleaning out my shed. 
I have a bunch of bus and other VW stuff I would rather not move. I am 
making it available for free on the list, with a couple of minor conditions:
1) You have to come get it. I really don't want to mail any of this stuff.
2) If you really like it and it has value to you, please donate an 
appropriate amount to the list. Paypal it to Ted at tedebare_at_type2_dot_com

First with an &quot;Ill take it&quot; gets it, but you have to come get it within 2 
or 3 weeks or Ill put it back on the list.

Stuff:

1) Top fold out cot from a Westy. The kind that fold in half like an army 
cot. Has hardware and canvas, but the canvas is pretty rotten.

2) A baywindow transmission. I don't know the type. How do I find out? I 
think that I took the nose cone off and put it back on, but without all of 
the sealing goop. (Just to see what was happening in the nose cone and 
compare it to mine.) Dirty.

3) A type IV short block. Coated the interior with white lithium grease 
before putting away about 2 years ago. Was dreaming of a type IV powerplant 
for my '71. No idea of the condition of the internals, nor mileage.

4) Some spare rubber mats from the floor of a baywindow. I don't remember 
if they are early or late, but I think that they were from a '69 or '70. I 
don't know exactly which mats, they are rolled up and I don't want to cut 
the tape on them.

5) A jalousie window or two from a baywindow. I am pretty sure it works.

6) A pair of 1971 rear brake lights with buckets. Rusty and needs a new 
spring on one of the electrical contacts. Lenses and rings in great shape.

7) A bugpack header for a 1600cc engine, painted with high temp paint. I 
bought this, then just used the muffler part and a different header.

8) Windshield wiper motor and linkage (with pivots that go through the 
body, and the cross arm) that says &quot;Vanagon&quot; on it, so it prob. is.

9) Rear view mirror. Glass and black plastic are perfect, the white shaft 
is kind of yellow.

Non-Bus stuff, but still VW:

1) The whole hood from a late model Type III.

2) Two ball joints for a Super Beetle: Part number 133 407 361

3) Two lower ball joints for a regular beetle after 1966+. Part number 131 
405 371

4) One upper ball joint for a regular beetle after 1966+.

5) 3/4 liter of synthetic power steering fluid for a new Golf. &quot;CHF 11S&quot; 
from Pentosin. The rest of the can is in German. Stuff was like $45 a liter 
when I bought it.

6) 8 pass tubular oil cooler from Bugpack in 90% condition, unused. A 
couple of bent fins you could fix with pliers. Doesn't come with any of the 
other bits like filter bracket, etc. Just the cooler.

7) OBerg square oil filter with screen (that prob. should be replaced) and 
tattletale mounting for an oil pressure switch. 8 inch I think.


Heck, come get it and sell it at the Bugout swapmeet this weekend. I can't 
go out there or I would toss it all on a blanket in the parking lot with a 
&quot;free&quot; sign on it. Or use it for your own nefarious purposes, I don't care. 
I just don't want to move it to Florida or throw it away.

Chris
