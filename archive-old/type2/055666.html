Subject: BRAZILOMEX MOTORS

Shoot, soon as I get done with one list, here comes another. This computer stuff is fun. ( new to me, it's exciting.) Forgot to mention the motor I installed was a Brazilian case with Mexico heads. Couldn't tell where it was assembled, but it was in a factory box. It had 3\4 inch NGK plugs in it and no distributor drive gear or shims. Came with a new late oil cooler, no stand-off, though. If I remember it was an AS 41 case. And yes, NO WARRANTY!!!! Personally, my own thought, my own opinion&gt; If I wanted to put one in a type 2, I would wait awhile until the miles get racked up and feedback starts coming in until I spent the money. Like I said, my friend was kind enough to be a guniea pig of sorts. I live in Nevada but I don't gamble. Thanks again. Jim Duncan
