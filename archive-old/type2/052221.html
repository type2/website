Subject: [T2] 76 owners manuals
Content-Disposition: Inline

I understand that John was overwhelmed by persons desirous of a 76
owners manual.  I too have been blessed with a spare manual that I would
like to pass on to another member, with a twist.

I ask that you only pay shipping for the manual.  However, to detirmine
who deserves this fine piece of (ahem) history, I want to hear your
story.  The best story of why you need this particular owners manual
will win it, free of charge.  The story doesn't have to be true, just
good.  And please, no &quot;my dog ate the other one&quot; stories, make it good!
If there isn't a clear and definate winner, we may have to take a vote
on it!

The moderators may want to save this for Friday, I don't know.  Maybe
they'll speak up and let us know.  

I will be gone all day Friday to Baton Rouge, the closest VW- speaking
machine shop I can find.  So lets say the best story by, say, 10 PM
Central time Saturday night, unless it gets Limited to Friday, then
we'll have to cut it off when I get home Friday night.  Well, any
takers???

Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most.
