Hi all...

Just wanted to confirm that the tray is an original Westfalia part which
came with all busses with the IceBox like the on in the '70-72 (not sure
what other years have them)

I have a scan of an original '70 camper suppliment booklet(also avalible on
line somewhere...but can't remember where...), witch shows the tray just
belor the Iceholder (the wire &quot;basket&quot;)  Unfortunatly these are a little
hard to find due to mis-uses that caused it to crack or brake in the past.
Most people used the tray to store the ice, and the 'basket' for other
things...

I haven't seen it aftermarket either...so the best one can do with out it is
find a tray that fits in the 'basket' or in the slider and connect the
hose...

Goodluck on your quest..

&lt;&lt;snippity...snip snip&gt;&gt;
&gt;I'm not saying it absolutely is not an original Westfalia part.  I'm saying
&gt;that in nearly 30 years of '68-'72 Westfalia Campmobile experience I've
&gt;never seen such a tray, even in a brand-new rig.
