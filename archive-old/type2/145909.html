Subject: Re: [T2] burning bus on COPS

If you have the stock emission controls on your bus, there are tubes
running from the top of the tank up into the fresh air ducts to
condensers there, then down to the charcoal canister. The idea being:
you don't want a direct link between the intake and fuel or fumes in the
tank. Doing so would risk an explosion if it ever backfired! On my very
non-stock arrangement, I connected the two tubes from the condensers
together and ran a new vent tube down through the drain hole in the left
&quot;battery tray&quot; area. So far, so good....no leaks, no big BOOM! If an
attendant is filling my tank, I always tell them to fill &quot;to the first
click, only, please&quot;.  Timo
