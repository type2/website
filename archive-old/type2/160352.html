I guess  my question is regarding this phenomena---
What makes him think it's a  broke loose seat?
What makes you assume that it's an intake  valve?

He doesn't even have all the engine tin off yet.

It's  little premature to be making this call.

A burnt up exhaust valve &amp;  seat is pretty common too.

Stay tuned for a burnt tulip , &amp;  seat.



hey Terry  you are right on being too early to know for suer.I am not  
assuming anything just stateing a fact.80% of the ones we see are intake seats ,  
this includes vanagons. Normally you will find exhust valves burnt or  dropped.  
 If he has done his homework and ran a compression test and  removed the 
rockers to see if there is a difference in the spring height then he  knows he has 
a problem. Another fact is that it is easier with engine out.   later  Mark
