Gee Michael, sounds like a lot of stuff to use to drop one little VW engine.  I have been getting by for years with a hydralic bottle and floor jack.  The floor jack is an el cheapo 1 ton, pretty small in fact the both jacks take up very little space under the rear seat of my camper.  Since moving to Oregon I have had two outings where the engine had to come out.  The first was a burnt &lt;hell, toasted&gt; clutch on Elmo my 59'.  No sweat.  Albert my 69' Riveria ate a throw out bearing arm last summer as I was pulling into a campground.  Needless to say the camp host sorta freaked when he came by and saw the engine sticking out the back of the bus.  But I had explained to him that I had made all fluid lines longer than they needed to be.  Hence I didn't have to disconnet any fluid lines!!  That set his mind at ease and a new throw out bearing fork was soon installed.  In fact, it took longer to do the fork than remove and reinstall the engine!!
Peace, Love, and retired boy scout,
      Mr. Bubble Head
