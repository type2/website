Subject: Single Vac Dual Advance Distributor

Hello All,
Can someone help me find what I need?  I am told my distributor is sticking,
causing HapyBus to run very hot.
I am running a dual vac dual advance distributor now (something about smog
control) and it was recommended to get the SVDA.
I have checked Bus Depot site and didn't see what read like what I am after.
Any leads?  I was told I could get it on aircoolednet???  I must be typing
the address wrong.
Anyone have  a link handy?

Thanx

FEBIII
