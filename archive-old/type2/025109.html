Subject: Re: [T2] Overheating was Re:Mexico

the Mexican buses with the &quot;suitcase&quot; on the front are water cooled Golf 
motors....

they never built Vanagons in Mexico or Brazil thats why thee are not very 
many,

Mexico never had Type 4s or waterboxers.....

So if you are planning an extended trip down there a 73-79 Bay window with an 
upright 1600 motor (and properly geared 68-73 tranny) would be closest to 
what they had.......

Also do not think they had power brakes......

when you see what they put their buses thru you can see they were well 
built......

Taxi Taxi !!!!
