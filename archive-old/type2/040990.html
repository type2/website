Let me see if I've got this right.  VW just made transporter buses and ALL
the busses with camper gear (fold down seats, poptops, cabinets, power
outlets, fridge/stove/sinks, etc.) were transporters that were redone with
conversion kits?

If so, then each bus conversion could very well be unique right?  How can
you tell which conversion you have?  Did shops convert the buses and sell
them or were they all contract work or privately done?  Both I suppose.

Wow.  Let me know if I'm getting this right or if I'm just out in my
'single-wide' smokin' Crack!
