&gt;Rather than mounting a blower in the belly SUCKING air from the heat 
&gt;exchangers I plan on mounting the two turbo style blowers in the engine

&gt;blowing it at 250cfm to one exchanger and the other pulling fresh air and 
&gt;blowing it at 250cfm to the other exchanger.

Why not just use a more efficient (effective) squirrel cage fan, since it 
isn't being mounted in-line with the heater duct?

&gt; From some of the discussion on the list it was also passed around that 
&gt; the belly style bilge blower COULD potentially SUCK more bad news into 
&gt; the system from a leaky heat exchanger/system while a blower system 
&gt; wouldn't create the negative pressure. Also, I don't know what kind of 
&gt; bilge blower you were running but mine was NOT quiet so sticking them in 
&gt; the back with the noise and the insulation would perhaps quiet things 
&gt; down a bit at full bore.

The bilge blower would go as far forward as possible, to get the air 
moving, after traveling all the way from the rear of the bus.
Yes, it will be noisy.  If the heater duct is pressurized (by the squirrel 
cage fan(s), &quot;bad news&quot; will not be sucked into the system.
With enough fan in the engine compartment, the front bilge blower may not 
be necessary.

&gt;Pulling warmer and warmer air from the cabin would eventually lead to 
&gt;warmer and warmer air while the fresh air would ensure you don't turn into 
&gt;a brick of ice on the inside from humidity. Put it all on a dial to adjust 
&gt;the speed perhaps ....

The fan in the engine compartment must be on (at least &quot;low&quot;) whenever the 
engine is running, or the heater boxes
will overheat.  In the summer, reconnect the stock heat set-up.
