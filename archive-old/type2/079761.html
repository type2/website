&gt;When I told my Dad I was going to my first all bus campout he asked me if

Don't mind the hippy image 'cause I'm still a freak. The bottom line is a
T-II can be used as a daily commutor, a cargo carrier and a camper, all in
one. AND, economical with reasonable maintenance with much better gas
milage than big sedans that weight as much or most SUV's in the large size
that most are now buying. The T-II is very Zen, the older the more so. It
gets the job done with good harmony, if you just take care of it half as
good as your dog.

I'm so busy right now I have to pre-schedule the toilet. Send me a p-mail
if you want an independant opinion, otherwise, I will probably unsubscribe
for a time 'till I get a chance to catch my breath. Had to respond to this
one 'cause culture, ape culture that is, interests me far more than T-II's
in the mechanical sence. It was culture that gave them iconography, and
tags them with symbolic meaning and a mythic nature.
