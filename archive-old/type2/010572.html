Subject: Cleaning Headliner
Message-Id: &lt;199911091740.MAA08541_at_owl.warren-wilson_dot_edu&gt;

O.k.  I tried to send this message yesterday but didn't see it show up  on the list.  If this is a repeat I appologize.

I am wondering if anyone has any suggestions for how to clean one of those white headliners we all know and love.  I n the archive someone suggested rubbing a dilute bleach solution on it and then wiping that off with water.   This sounds like a good Idea to me but I was just wondering how effective this will be and if anyone has had any experience with it.
Any other Suggeations?
I am contemplating buying a van and this is the last problem I have with it.  The owner says it is just mold and it will clean up pretty easily but I am not so sure.  What do you all think?

Thanks in advance,
