Subject: RE: [T2] Tires

&gt; Aren't snow tires generally considered suitable for mud and
&gt; off road use?


Actually, you're right, the Vredestein Snows would probably do a better job
in mud than the Hankooks because they are better in snow. I hadn't thought
much about this because Michael said he didn't want snows. But yes, the
designation for a &quot;snow&quot; tire is actually &quot;M&amp;S,&quot; which means &quot;mud and snow,&quot;
so a tire that's better in snow will also be better in mud. Perhaps the
Comtrac Winter (http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=COMTRACWIN) would
do the job for Michael, at least as well as any tire could that isn't
designed specifically as an all-terrain tire.

As an aside, it's perhaps worth noting that all-season tires (including the
Hankooks) are also designated &quot;M&amp;S,&quot; just as snows are  But this designation
should not be construed as meaning that they perform as well in snow as a
good snow tire. The reason is that U.S. standards for rating a tire &quot;M&amp;S&quot;
are very lax.  I spoke at length to Vredestein about this a while ago. They
pointed out that many tire manufacturers take full advantage of the lax U.S.
standards, selling the identical tire as a &quot;summer&quot; tire in Europe and an
&quot;all season&quot; tire in the U.S.  To turn it into a U.S.-market &quot;all season&quot;
tire, they change nothing but the labeling on the sidewall!  As a company
that prides themselves on their snows, Vredestein is a big proponent of
using dedicated snows in the winter, not all-season tires. Having replaced
my rear Hankooks with a pair of Vredestein Snowtracs
(http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=SNOWTRAC) this winter for the
first time (previously I used the Hankook all-seasons year-round), I can
attest to the difference. While the Hankooks are better snow/ice tires than
most other &quot;all-season&quot; tires I've used, the Vredestein Snowtracs were still
far better when we got a foot of snow here last week.
