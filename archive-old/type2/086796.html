Subject: Re: [T2] Engine to Tranny - 3 bolts?

&gt; I also pulled the engine from my '71 bus and I had the Bentley manual and

&gt; when I read in the Bentley manual that on the '71 bus ONLY 3 BOLTS HOLD THE
&gt; ENGINE TO THE TRANSMISSION! The &quot;How to Rebuild. . .&quot; book said that the
&gt; upper left bolt had to be removed from underneath. This is the same bolt not
&gt; referenced by the Bentley manual - apparently the one that is not needed?


&gt; Since the books seem to contradict each other, which one is correct? Does a
&gt; stock '71 only need 3 bolts? If so I'd like to leave the upper left off due

I always had all four in my 71 IIRC and I have always felt like a VW
engine wasn't held in tight enough for my nervous self. (no never had one
fall out)  so I would be anal about putting in all four, but the right
size and yes they are a relatively minor PITA to get in and out.
