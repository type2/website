Subject: 76 engine vs. 73

Hi-

I have the opportunity to buy a 76 bus with good running engine and 
trashed body.  And, I have a 73 bus that could use an engine.  Will 
the 76 engine fit into a 73 bus without significant modification? 
Can somebody tell me what changed between 73 and 76 (for CA busses)? 
I assume there was some additional smog stuff added to the 76.  If 
that is true, since the 73 bus does not require a smog cert, can the 
smog stuff be removed without dorking up the 76 engine?

Thanks for any insight!
