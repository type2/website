&gt; yes good idea BUT that is not what I am trying to do
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to get LED's behind the original taillight lenses so that it
&gt; looks stock but has bright lights so you can be seen, starting with
&gt; stop/tail lights, hope to get turn signals working too, not going to
&gt; bother with backup light.

There are LED replacements for 1156 and 1157 bulbs. They are so bright that
you'll have a whitish light coming from behind the lens with a small
circular pattern that pierces the lens instead of a giving off a nice red
glow. Want that classic beetle taillight look?

I don't think they are as effective as having true LED taillights with clear
lenses and faceted reflectors. I've seen a lot of motorcycles with modified
under-tails that were ruined by modifications. No wonder DOT doesn't want to
approve them: most make the lighting less effective.

I think it's best to color match the LED to the lens if you do experiment.
I've seen Halogen 1156/1157s for sale but haven't tried them, again, because
of the cost.

&gt; may later put in the third light like you have done

I certainly notice them on SUVs. I put the tape on the get attention all the
time not just braking. It's amazing how far back some people drive now.
