&gt; &gt; I'm a big fan of Google's Picasa photo management tool. It has a screen saver that let's you point to a directory with photos so you can put anything up you set up. It's well written, doesn't hog resources like some screen savers. No pop up ads either.

&gt; If you're a MicroSerf using XP or 2000 you already have this feature built
&gt; in.

Linux is also avaliable for a FREE download from the site
