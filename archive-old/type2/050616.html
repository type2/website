Still a bad idea, IMHO, as the fitting on your stock
fuel pump is still metric. What happens when you try
to clamp a larger diameter hose on a smaller fitting,
is actually creating a gap in the hose (where the
excess material is scrunched together)...this will
eventually allow *some* fuel to penetrate. Not much;
you might not even notice it...but eventualy, the line
will come loose. Not good. Especially for us upright
owners, where the fuel pump is located next to that
sparky little thing called a dizzy;-)

It's far better to stretch the proper diameter hose
over the larger fittings, than to risk a fire.


When I first bought my '69 Westy, a VW mechanic friend
immediately noticed the new, but non-stock fuel line.
Without saying a word, he went in his shop, came back
with the proper hose and replaced it. He charged me
for the hose, and said, 'Trust me, you'll thank me
later'.

We're only talking a few bucks here, folks. Look at
the time and money you've put into your bus and ask
yourself, 'Is it *really* worth it????'. I didn't
think so, either.

Moral of the rant: &quot;He who gambles life (not just
yours, but your passenger's as well) and limb to save
a couple of bucks, may well lose *both* in the end&quot;.
