I don't know about that.  The dry humour contained in the Haynes manual's
cautionary notes slay me.

Example: &quot;Brake fluid makes a splendid paint remover...&quot;

Not to say I don't find Muir funny.  One of the Muir Publishing books (was
it the Idiot's Guide or the People's Guide to Mexico?) had an unforgetable
description of how to straighten a bent tie-rod using only a chain, the
bus, reverse gear, and the only supporting column for the roof of a
shade-tree mechanic's garage.

On a more serious note, I have Bentley, Haynes, and Muir, and generally
read through the procedure in each one (in the above order, usually) before
doing anything new.  Sometimes the manuals don't agree on how something
should be done, and that can be illuminating.  Bentley's got good specs and
pix.  Haynes has got good step-by-step and often different pix.  Muir
reminds me to tie back my long hair, and captures the groove of the whole
trippy mechanic thing.  And we gotta groove when we commune with the bus,
man.
