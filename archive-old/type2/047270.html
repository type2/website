A local guy wsed the toyota engine in his 71 westy and mounted the radiator
above the roof cargo carrier to the rear of the pop top.  Its at the front in
newer Westy's.

If you are willing to do the work and expense of the conversion, go for it.

I'm considering a lower speed axle ratio to give me more bottom end and midrange
pulling power.  I am willing to sacrifice top speed.  60 to 65 is the speed I
drive.

The cooling system requirements are the most dificult to overcome, I think.
Plus coming up with a heater system.  Do you like the challenge of fabrication?

The aluminum V-8 did interface quite nicely with my 78 Volvo wagon.
