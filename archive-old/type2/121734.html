Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor timing nut

&gt;Dumb querstion #23:  the 2&quot; distributor nut that you  undo to move 
&gt;the distributor to time it: can that nut and clamp be moved around 
&gt;the base of the distributor??  Like, I want to mive it 90 degrees 
&gt;counter clockwise.

Sorry Barry, but what you're asking for can't be done.  The 2&quot; long 10mm nut
is integral with the clamp and the clamp is held to the case so it can only
go on one way.  

I have an extra long, very slender Snap-On 10mm open-end wrench that does
the trick for me.  Turn the nut as far as you can, flip the wrench over,
turn it as far as you can, repeat until tight.  The good news is the nut
only needs to be loosened about 1/2 turn to adjust the timing and it doesn't
need to be &quot;gorilla-tight&quot; afterwards.
