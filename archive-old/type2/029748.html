Volks,

One of the constants of life on 20-50 year old cars is corrosion in the
push-on connectors, causing unreliable connections, especially in early
tail lamp assemblies.  I have been trying to think of a cure for this for
a while.  My standard procedure is to take some 600 grit wet/dry sand
paper and polish the male connectors with that, and if the situation
warrants, fold a strip up small and slide it thru the female end as well.  
While this works, it is not a permanent repair and it is incredibly time
consuming if you have any large number of connetors to do. another thing
is to pinch the female end a tiny bit with a vice-grip if the connector is
loose on the spade.

It occurred to me that an ideal product to cure the problem would be
a substance that would (a) reduce (in the oxidation removal sense)
corrosion, inhibit corrosion, and be conductive in itself.  I know of no
product that fulfils all three of these requirements, but I have two
substances in mind that may be partial winners.  The first is plain old
anti-sieze compound.  It is metal based and should be corrosion-inhibitive
and conducting, so it will at least prevent recurrence.  The second is
something called Noalox, a corrosion inhibitor for exterior high-voltage
connections (as when the power company brings a feed to your house).  If
anyone has any other suggestions or has used either of these products on
push-on connectors, by all means, let me know!
