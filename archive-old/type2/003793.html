Subject: 79 Westy and 090 auto tranny and mega leaks???

I don't own a Bentley and will buy one soon, but meanwhile, I'm
experienceing some serious leaking. I have one that drips down the oil
filter, but it appears tight. I'm wondering if it's the filter housing where
it attaches to the block. The other is more perplexing because I can't
figure if it's tranny oil or engine oil. It appears to be coming down from
inside the auto tranny area where it is open at the bottom, and you can see
the torqueconverter?? spinning around when the engine runs. It is towards
the engine side of these openings, and drips about once every 3-4 seconds so
it's pretty bad. Any thoughts on this??
Thanks,
Courtney
