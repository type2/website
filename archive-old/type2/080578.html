Subject: Re: [T2] Mystery wire

&gt;&gt; Other question: do all brown wires with white stripe go to ground?  I have
&gt;&gt; one coming up from the corner by the fuse box.  No current running through
&gt;&gt; it.
&gt;Brown with a tracer color is yes BUT it is going thru someting to get to ground,
&gt;i.e. a switch, a coil in a relay, etc.

Try dome lite, driver's door.
