Hi Mike,

    I-beam front end:
    You need a special tool to pull/press the trailing arms together, to
check to lower ball joint. The same tool spreads the arms to unload the
upper ball joints. Point is you must take the torsion bar/spring pressure
off the ball joint to check for slack. 1/32 slack means replacement!

Control arm front end:
    You will still have to unload the ball joint to check it. Take a floor
jack and place it under the lower control arm. Jack the bus up, and put it
on a jack stand under the ball joint at the end of the control arm. When you
let the jack down on the stand, the pressure will be off both of the ball
joints. Have some one lift up, move in and out, push and shove on the tire,
while you watch the ball joints. There should be no more than 1/32 movement
in any direction.

    The lower ball joint on both type front ends is likely to have the most
slack as it does the most work, and has the spring pressure on it at all
times.
