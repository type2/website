Subject: Re: [T2] Yay! Someone made HE replacements!

Hi Don,

Nice idea.. but I don't know if I like the look of the flanges. They  
list them as fitting 72-83 without mention of the fact that the 79-83  
have square exhaust ports.

If you have oval-port exhaust, a better idea is to get a set of 411/412  
heater boxes and tear the flimsy metal shell off them.

Happy trails,
