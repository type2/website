Subject: 78 Westy 2.0L engine weak fire

Just finished replacing the fuel lines,filter and pressure regulator,
started engine and was running very bad. Checked the firing on plugs and
it is weak. Checked voltage on coil (10.7 ) and fire from coil was yellow
and weak.The wire from 15 on coil goes to a plug? mounted on the heating
fan. Had to stop working on it for now, will continue tommorrow. Will not
idle until it warms up but still missing bad when warm. I did change
coils and had same problem. Has anyone had this problem and know what
might fix it. New points and plugs, dwell at 49.5. TIA
