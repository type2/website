There is test info in Bentley section 4.9 of Fuel Injection.  I might have
seen a talk about measuring the rate of fuel expelled in the archives.

&gt; it big deal to take it out? Also, while I was back

No big deal to remove the injector, it's only held in with one nut.  Just
remove the hose that connects the #3/4 fuel rail to the metal rail running
to the cold start valve.  Then wiggle stuff until it's removed.  Be careful
not to damage the end of the injector.

Be ready to mop up the residual fuel that will seep from the fuel lines.

&gt; there, I noticed something strange. Out of the same
&gt; wiring harness that the connectors for injectors 3 and
&gt; 4 come out, there is another connector that is
&gt; identical, but it isn't connected to anything - it
&gt; just hangs there. I cannot find anything that it could
&gt; be connected to. Does anyone know what this is?

See Bentley, page 22 of Fuel Injection.  It has a nice image of the harness
and it's connectors with legend.  Probably #8, EGR connector.
