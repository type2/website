&gt;Folks,

&gt;I have a rare opportunity to be in Germany next week on business.

So find this out for us. If you want to buy a whatzit for a T-2, what kind 
of vendor do you seek?? Just what does a German FLAPS look like??? Do you 
see any 5DM Chinese wrench sets on the shelves?? Please take photos of any 
models you see that we don't have over here, cars that is, not Chinese wrenchs.
