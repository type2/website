Subject: Sticking brakes
Message-ID: &lt;3826D8AD.E8A514E3_at_supernet_dot_net&gt;

Anyone have suggestions for remedying front disc brakes that stick?  I
rebuilt the calipers (new seals &amp; dust covers) and replaced the front
hoses, but the brakes really drag.  Once the car has set for a while
they'll loosen up a bit, but after a few pedal presses I can't move the
right front wheel by hand and when driving it feels similar to the
effect of having your parking brake on.  Master cylinder??
