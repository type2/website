&gt;The answer Joe is fairly simple - increased exhaust emissions.  

Don't you mean REDUCED exhaust emissions?  Could you please explain how
smaller intake valve size achieves this?

&gt;All auto manufacturers were doing the low-tech emissions compliance 
&gt;dance in the '70s (VW still doesn't have a 4-valve/cylinder in anything 
&gt;other than the GTI - 

Again, how does 4 valves per cylinder help emissions?  

&gt;Toyota has had this technology in all plain-Jane sedans since the '80s).
This &gt;increase in engine breathing (despite emissions) is one of the
reasons the '78 &gt;2L engine is preferred for the Bus.

Why the 78 over the other years?  76-79 all had the same intake valve size.
