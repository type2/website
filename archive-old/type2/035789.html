Subject: Re: KYB, another counterpoint

My bus had been sitting idle for about 6 months when I crawled under it one
day to do some work.  All of a sudden I noticed a puddle of oil forming under
one of the rear KYB's where the ground had been dry a minute before.
Apparently it sprung a leak at the exact time I was under the bus.  Within
minutes all the oil leaked out.  If I had not seen this happen I would never
have known because a few days later, when I took the shocks off, everything
looked perfectly normal.
I grabbed my receipts and tried to cash in on the KYB lifetime warranty, but
was told I had to return it to the place of original purchase.  Unfortunately
that place went out of business years earlier.
So I had to buy two new KYB's.  Upon comparing the old shocks with the new I
noticed the new shocks are about an inch shorter during full extension.  This
is bad because now, if my rear suspension ever fully extends, the shock is
going to be the first thing to bottom out.  Yea, the lifetime warranty is
great, if you can get it.

Another counterpoint.

Love the KYB ride, not too happy with the KYB quality.

&gt; In the time I have had KYBs on my 78 bus, I have replaced 4 of them, all on
&gt; the rear.  They last about 6 months, and then leak all the oil out,
&gt; rendering them useless.

&gt; A lifetime warranty is great,
&gt;
&gt; Just a counterpoint.
