&lt;&lt;All,

To anyone interested in installing a trio of gauges, I
highly recommend this plate....it looks GREAT!!! It
truly looks stock and most people assume it is. I will
take a photo or two of mine and post it on my web-site
soon.

Just be careful where you mount it.  I put mine under the dash facing up 
towards me.  The problem is that at night the light from the gauges reflects 
off my knee and reflects in the windshield.  Now if I ever get my dimmer 
switch working, I can cut down on the reflection.
