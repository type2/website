&gt;&gt; Talked to Marco _at_ Buslab this morning about this.  &gt;Glad I did,

&gt;
&gt; Which we all now know is not true thanks to Mr. Atwell's post, if we 
&gt; didn't know it already.

I think Marco must have been thinking of the non-FI tank.

&gt; This is why it pains me to death to hand over my bus to mechanics now.

Eh, I'm not going to hold a tank outlet description mistake against 
these guys (it certainly did me no harm, other than getting my hopes up 
for an easier repair).  All they work on are Busses and Vanagons (well, 
ok, I've seen a couple of really nice old Beetles in there before, and 
Marco does have a couple of early 911s in there, too...)

Every experience I've had with Buslab has been positive, and I would 
recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat.
