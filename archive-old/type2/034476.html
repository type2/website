Subject: starter switch

Hi all,
   I need you 2 tell me if my thinking is clear on an electrical problem.  
It seems to make sense to me but.........  Well our 71 westy has been 
grounded for the last week and a half so I could change the cv joints.  Well 
the parts finally came and today was a beautiful one, perfect for putting in 
drive shafts.
   With the drive shafts installed I've got to take it for a test drive, 
right?  Well I turn the key to the first position; idiot lights and gas 
gauge, check.  Turn to the start position and, deafening silence. Release 
the key.  Second try the same as the first, but i notice at the start 
position the idiot lights and gas gauge stop working.  Hmm never had this 
before. Well out with the Bentleys manual and the schematic for 71 model 
year.  I found the 5 contact terminal block, for starter switch wires, and 
measure 12 volts on the red wire , comming into the switch.  The red with 
black wire, output from switch to starter solenoid, is showing only 2 volts. 
  So I think, ok bad starter switch, i can work around that.  So the next 
test is to connect the 12 volt red wire to the red with black wire that 
delivers to the solenoid.  I was expecting to hear the starter, but no luck, 
nothing.  So with the wife holding those same two wires together, I go under 
the bus and measure 12 volts at the solenoid, as i expected to.  OK bad 
soleniod right?  Well i get out the trusty 1 inch open end wrench and jump 
the terminals, 12 volts directly to the starter. Still nothing.
   So now I think I've had both the starter switch and the starter go bad.  
Would my VW do this to me during this season of joy and peace?  Does it 
sound like 2 problems or am i missing something here?

thanks for the help I know you'll offer
