Subject: 24volt/dc battery charger. What if .......

Hello folks,

Seeking opinions here ......

Someone just gave me a nice battery charger that can charge 12 or 24
volt. At the 24 volt setting it puts out 16 amps charge to the battery.
I have a friend who knows you can get the starter to turn better and
faster jumping it with 24 volts. He's been doing it for years. An old
mechanic trick.

Question:

Does anybody know for sure the dangers, or lack of, if a 12volt battery
is charged at 24volts and 15+ amps for an extended period of time.

I assume the battery life will be shortened and good ventilation is a
must but will it blow up or pop the case? How long can it be left on at
24volt charge ?
I know at a 12 volt charge alot of vapor is generated on overcharging
but I'm looking for a faster charge short of overcharging.

Anybody have any experience in this ? (Opinions are OK but don't get
nasty.)

Just curious. (Actually, I want to do it without having it blow up in my
face.)

thanx.
