Subject: re: where you live

     Lea and I live in Gainesville, FL.  Both our busses are daily drivers. 
     
     My type II is a '66 Standard turned camper, named Horst after an 
     elderly bodyman who did some work for me and had the best stories 
     about working on VW's in Berlin during WWII.  It's now 12volt, 
     replaced pop-outs with jalousie windows (need one crank), has a 
     seat/bed (full width) and nothing else in back.  It's a walk-thru.  
     Not much to look at (blue/white) outside but nice inside and very 
     sound mechanically (lots &amp; lots of work the last 6 years).  
     
     Lea's bus is a '63 single cab that we just bought a few months ago.  
     It's turquoise and in great shape.  You have to hunt for the rust.  
     We've done considerable re-wiring and finally everything electrical 
     works!  She's naming it &quot;Liebschen&quot; if I'm spelling it correctly.
     
     Previous bus was a mid-50's panel that I owned in the early 70's.  My 
     son's playpen was the only thing inside behind the cab.  He 
     practically lived in it night and day for 18 months but doesn't 
     remember it at all, although he really feels comfortable in my '66.
     
     We're taking both current busses to Tampa NEATO show and Land-O-Lakes 
     Nov. 9&amp;10.  Hope to see you there.  
     
     Ray &amp; Lea Hale
