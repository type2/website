Subject: 72 Radio, rocker panels

Hello All

I recently purchased a 72 camper, down here in Maryland.  It's interior
were in excellent condition, and  it all appears stock, even the engine
looks as if it has all stock parts.  As a result I want to begin to
restore it to stock condition.

It has no radio.  I'd like to get an original radio.  However, I have
never seen an original radio in a bus before.  Does anyone know what
kind they are, and what they look like.  Hopefully I might see on at VW
events soon and pick one up, but I don't know what to look for.

Also there was some rust on the tire wells.  It was at the end of the
rocker panels.  It quickly crimbled away.  The panels themselves, on the
exterior, look great.  However I can see a lot of surface rust inside.
Is there any I can stop this rust.  I'm looking for a temporary fix
that'll last a couple of years till I strip down the bus and restore the
body, at which point I won't have to replace the panels, just clean them
up.

Any help is appreciated

Brent
