Hello all,

I just finished my first tune up. New points, condensor, wires, plugs, cap,
rotor, and oil. I finally, with some help, figured out how to time my van
properly (it was at 36 degrees, not 5!). But ever since all my changes have been
made, I have detected the odour of burning.... something. I was told it was
probably just carbon burning, and since it was running better than ever, I
thought nothing of it. 

But today I was happily driving along when I noticed a lot of smoke right in
front of my eyes (apparantly coming from the defroster vents - which normally
don't even work). So I pulled over to look at the engine and there were massive
amounts of smoke coming from the fan housing, just all over the place. Also,
oill was dripping from the bottom of the engine quite steadily and the fan was
just dripping in oil. 

I was told that this could have been that I just added too much oil, but I
checked my dipstick and it was low. I have also been told that it could be that
I've overrevved the engine and blown a crankcase seal or something. Could that
be it? Anything else? 

Any help is much appreciated, I need the van working for next week.

I don't think I'm alone when I say I'd like to
see more and more planets fall under the
ruthless domination of our solar system.
