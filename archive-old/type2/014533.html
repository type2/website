Hey, thanks for the info on the 68 door latches.  I think I know where I can
investigate how the doors should work, now that I know what other years have
the same ones.  However, there is more to my message than a door latch.  I,
thinking I might have needed it and finding a good price, bought a
transmission for a 71 bus for 150$. However, I don't need it (yet), and it
seems the lint in my pockets has finally won the war and assumed complete
occupation last week... So,  if anyone is interested in this price, please
contact me.  Fluid level is good, everything that should turn or move a
certain way appears to do so well.  I live in Las Cruces, New Mexico which
brings me to another idea.  If the people in Nogales (? Arizona) still need
any parts, I could ask a friend of mine who also lives here, if he'd be
interested in supplying them.  

thanks
matt
