Subject: Re: Rear Axle Nut Problem.

Volks,

Here is a neat trick for getting off seized or frozen axle nuts.

You need a BIG plumbers wrench with smooth jaws. Not the zig zagged bite
pattern, but smooth.

Open up the wrench to fit snuggly on the nut.

Place the handle on the nut so that the handle is pointing towards the
floor. 

Start the engine and put the bus in reverse.

SLOWLY back up until the handle of the BIG wrench is touching the ground and
goes taught. Then give the van a bit more gas. The nut will give way all at
once.

I have NEVER met an axle nut that this technique did not work on.

However, you MUST have a large wrench, about 3 feet long for this to work.

Good luck,

Matt
