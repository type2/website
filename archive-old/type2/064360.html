Subject: Re: what is rubbing compound?

It's an abrasive paste that will help you remove the oxydized surface of
your paint, thereby revealing the untarnished paint below. Of course, you
can only do this so often, but it seems that VW used to apply a pretty
thick layer of paint.

Rubbing compound comes in different grades of abrasiveness. To buff your
paint job, use the least abrasive kind: you don't want to remove more than
you have to.
