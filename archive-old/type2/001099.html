Hi Roland and other listees,
Well I checked out the hoses , they look ok. I had the afm out, its closing
ok, The throttle is closing ok,  I can blow through the auxiliary air valve
when cold, can't  when it's hot. Tried bypassing the crankcase breather, no
effect. disconnected the aux air valve and plugged the hole, no effect. Now
I'm about to harass that big round thing with a vacuum hose one side, and
two air hoses the other side. I think it's called a decelleration valve.
What actually is its function?
Geoff

&gt; A couple of suggestions on your symptom:
&gt; Check to see if the throttle valve is fully closing after you have run it
&gt; for a while. Crud can build up in the valve throat and impede it's return
to
&gt; full closure. Just turn it by hand. If it slows down, then remove the
valve
&gt; and clean the passageway. Get a new gasket (valve to air distribution
&gt; manifold) before you start, however.
&gt; Check for leaks in the air hose and its connections that supplies the
&gt; auxiliary air valve from the s-shaped air hose. That valve is the
&gt; thermostatically controlled equivalent of a choke. If you have a crack in
&gt; the hose or a leak of air at any fitting in the pathway, then unmonitored
&gt; air can get into the distribution manifold which causes a too lean
condition
&gt; when cold, which one then mistakenly compensates for by opening the idle
air
&gt; screw so it will idle when cold, but then when the temperature shuts dcwn
&gt; the auxiliary air valve the engine speeds up because that closes off the
air
&gt; leak, and now you are running with the idle screw too far open. Let me
know
&gt; if that helps!
&gt; Roland
