I'm living a dream.

As a kid, we traveled all up and down the CA coast in my dad's 72 Westy 
hardtop. Then when I was 19 he moved and asked me to sell it for him, which 
I did, for $1200, all original, orig. everything barely worn and 120K miles 
with a new longblock.

I regretted selling it ever since.  So I'm finally back with a Westy, I 
almost sort of &quot;impulse bought&quot; on Ebay. But I think I got a good deal.  BUT 
I doubt I will buy a car over the net again. You gotta see 'em up close, 
feel it, look under it, etc.

But for about $600 I figured, what could I lose....

So, we took off about 7 am for Yuma, from L.A. About 300 miles one way. We 
hit snow in the mountain pass between San Diego and the desert. It worried 
me, but it was all gone by the time we headed back.

So we finally got out there and the bus looked a bit worse than I had 
imagined it. There was a really bad bondo and paint job on the nose, and 
some rust here and there. It didn't look like it was rusted through 
anywhere, but closer inspection will tell later on.

The interior was pretty filthy. Sitting in AZ with a window missing, all 
kinds of sand and dirt had been blowing into there for three months. But the 
interior was pretty complete, so it seemed potentially good. The biggest 
disappointment was that white was not the original color. The hidden parts 
of the interior and the inside of the engine compartment were still a bright 
red, the factory color.

The guy put a battery in it, started it up and drove it onto the trailer, so 
at least I know it runs (for about 15 feet anyway). He had to work the 
e-brake, since the brakes need bled. They go all the way to the floor twice 
before catching. Ouch.

I was really pleased to find that the seller had the paperwork from the guy 
who owned it from 1975 until 1999. And he kept every registration (There's a 
stack, in order, from 1975 to 1999) and a notebook with miles logged, 
fill-ups and repairs. (Turned it's first 100,000 miles on 8/6/76!).

So, we towed it home. That drive took about 7 hours, with a couple of stops 
for food and what-not.

Today, I went out for a closer look. I got the Simple Green and a roll of 
paper towels, and what do you know.. the thing is pretty celan!

Barely a scratch on any of the cabinets. No lifting of the formica, water 
pump still works, no signs of molestation other than a surface mounted 
speaker behind each of the front seats and an 8-track player mounted under 
the dash.

I put a battery in it and the electricals are a bit sketchy. Wipers and 
headlights work, even the Saphire IX radio was blaring tunes out the top of 
the dash. But the flashers don't work. So some poking around will be in 
order there.

Another bad thing is, just about every piece of rubber on the thing is rock 
hard or missing, and there is some bondo in the rockers. Kind of surprising 
for an AZ bus, but from the guy's log it looks ike he drove it to Chicago, 
Oregon, Washington State, etc.

Like I said, I think I still got a good deal, considering it runs, the clean 
camper setup and all.

So here's the web pages I made for the camper.

Anything I do to it I want to be original, and I have plenty of questions 
about OEM things. If anyone is a self-proclaimed expert on 69 buses, 
specifically Westfalias, if you could Pmail me, I can avoid pestering the 
list with a long string of questions. Hey, what happened to the archive? 
(just kidding!)

Thanks, hope to see y'all 'round.
