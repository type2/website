Subject: Anyone buy the Bus Depot Stainless Exhaust?

I'm interested in the stainless exhaust system offered by the Bus Depot and 
I'd like to hear from anyone who has bought and installed one.

As I understand it, the exhaust fits the late model bus with the type 4 
engine.  I believe that only the outside of the muffler is stainless, the 
pipes are not.

I'm used to running a less restrictive exhaust, and I'm a little concerned 
about the performance.  I'm also interested in the fit and finish, as I am 
tired of replacing gaskets on my poor fitting bugpack system.
