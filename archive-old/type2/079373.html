&gt; &gt; I have 71 westy and the indicated speed is around 20-25mph+!!!!....when you
&gt; &gt; take apart the speedo, what do you adjust to make it right? How difficult is
&gt; &gt; it to take the speedo apart?
&gt;
&gt; The needle is attached to a shaft. On the shaft is a hairspring. On the other
&gt; end of the shaft is the speed cup. The speed cup does NOT touch anything else.
&gt; It turns by a magnetic field.
&gt; The hairspring only dampens pulses and keeps the needle from bouncing.

Actually, the spring returns the needle to zero and provides the
countering torque to that provided by the eddy current cup.  The faster
you go, the more torque is applied to the needle shaft.

If the speedo, like mine, reads high the cause is either a weakening of
the hairspring or wear on the bushings that support the rotating magnet or
the eddy current cup.  I'm pretty brave about mechanical devices, but this
is one that I'll leave to a specialist like North Hollywood speedo.  I
understand the problem completely, but lack the parts and expertise to fix
it.  $100 is cheap to get the knowhow of a professional.

I wonder if the Brazilian buses might have similar speedos fitted as new?

In my case, I use the speedometer for entertainment and read my true
speed from the GPS,  My speedo reads 75MPH at an actual 62, which is great
fun if you have inexperienced passengers.
