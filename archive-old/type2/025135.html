I will probably catch hell for saying this but, Try mineral oil to flush
with...that would help clean it out and get all the crud out too...

Thank You,

I saw the recommendation for Amsoil synthetic gear oil for manual tranny
fluid and will probably go that way too.
Question: I just drained the oil out of my '73 (acquired last year, so have
no idea how often, if at all, this oil was ever changed) and it was very
dirty.  Before filling it up with Amsoil and putting it back in the vehicle
(it's out at this time), should I flush it with something to get the crud
out?  If so, what should I use to flush?
