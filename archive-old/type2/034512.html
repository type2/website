Subject: Re: oil problems

Those oil filters connected to the pumps are notorious for being out of
spec. What you are experiencing is a symptom of cheap aftermarket parts
that are engineered with more emphasis on chrome than on in-spec
measurements. The best approach would likely be to have the case tapped for
a full-flow setup coming out of one of the oil galleys and use a stock
in-spec oil pump or a high quality over-sized pump. Yes, this requires
tearing the engine down.

There is a pump that has the outlet for full-flow (but not the spin-on
filter), but I don't recall the builder and the guy I got it from is
currenly &quot;on tour&quot; and not available via e-mail, phone, or fax. If you know
how to send up smoke signals, look for Jim Thompson. I sold the bus this
was on, so I can't even tell you what to look for...except that the
auto-shift beetles had a pump similar to this and one of those, I was told,
could be used for a full-flow setup (?maybe with some modification?).

BTW, this topic has been discussed by experts on the list in the past, so
check the archives at www.type2_dot_com. Also, the Bob Hoover CD (available
from www.busdepot_dot_com) covers this topic thoroughly.

Have fun! Joe

&gt;Hello, I have this crazy problem with my 1835 cc typr1 engine, since I have
&gt;owned it it will leak oil out of the oil pump area, even when I just turn it
&gt;over oil starts leaking out, I have rebuilt to solve the problem but to no
&gt;avail, I have tried 3 different oil pumps, currently i hve a oil filter
&gt;connected pump, and it still leaks. Any ideas would help
&gt;
