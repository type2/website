Subject: RE: [T2] Using the Bus Depot part number search engine

&gt; BTW, even though the bar says, &quot;Search by Part # No dashes or 
&gt; spaces&quot; you can use spaces to find parts by number. I think 
&gt; this text is a hold over from the old website.


Well, dashes will throw it off, but it's knows to ignore spaces. It will
also search partial numbers, so you can leave off the letter at the end
if you want. This can be useful in finding a supercision where all they
did is supercede to a new letter on the end. Of course if they
superceded the whole number this won't help.  Also a different letter
may mean a different application (i.e.a part fitting a later model), not
necessarily a supercision.
