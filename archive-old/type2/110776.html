So that I can keep my battery topped up as well as run assorted 12volt
stuff while camping if I
actually had a land line. Sorry for the confusion.
----- Clip ----------------
Sounds like you just need a generic battery charger with an automatic
shut off for times when you have 120v and a solar panel for when you
don't.
The solar panels will only provide a trickle charge.
Contact Larry Chase lchase_at_ATTGLOBAL.NET he's using some on his syncro.
He's be a good authority on the subject.
