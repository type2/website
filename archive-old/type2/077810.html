Subject: Cannot get 3 and 4 to run...2l 82 vanagon

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C19740.3DB667F0

Volks,

Please, no flames about putting on the Webers...........I am an FI believ=
er, but the PO of this van bastardized the motor by using &quot;Spirit of the =
Wind&quot; a vw &quot;shop?&quot; in Asheville, NC.........the dufus there put early typ=
e 4 heads and heat exchangers on, thus compromising everything for the FI=
...........

Worked hard on an 82 westy this past weekend that I bought for resale.  T=
o make a long story short, it has Weber 44's installed that only have abo=
ut 5000 miles on them.  It has an 050 dizzy, and a cb performance electri=
c fuel pump that has the correct carb fuel pressure.

Well, got the timing set at 7.5 BTDC on number one, and it fires right up=
. When pulling wires off the distributor cap, when pulling a and 2 the mo=
tor stumbles instantly.  When pulling 3 and 4, nothing.  Gave more thrott=
le and pulled wires, nothing...no change in rpm's.

So i pulled the idle jets, and they had a little debris, put them back in=
, same result.  You can see when it is running that the fuel is not getti=
ng burned...it is floating around in the venturis. tightened intake, same=
 result...sprayed brake cleaner around intake.....nothing.  Road t4ested,=
 and can feel a cylinder kick in now and then. =20

Compression tested 3 and 4  135 lbs in each..... tested wires with a plug=
 in the end, and sure enough, spark...torqued plugs back in.....same resu=
lt.

I am at wits end here, for it is a sweet van that i truly need to get on =
the market.................
