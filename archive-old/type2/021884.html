Hi Volks!

&gt; The spare tyre of my bus is mounted on the front of it. Where do you keep
&gt; your spare if it's not mounted up front? Does it depend what equipment
&gt; you've got inside, or is there some secret hiding place I've missed :)

On walkthrough models, it resides in the left rear corner, in
the luggage area above the engine.  There's an indentation
there.  Buses had a plastic cover over it.

On partition models, it's under the front passenger bench seat.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
