whew all these messages about Ron, I have to tell you about the other side
of his service.

Yesterday, Thursday, at about 4PM while putting in a new Auto Tranny I
discover the seal I have is bad.   I called the Bus Depot, and asked if he
had any in stock,  Ron checked said no, but he could have em by 11 Fri.
morning.

Now this is a real odd part, the torque converter seal on an Auto tranny
bus.

I need this bad, so Fri morning I drive 140 miles to the Depot and at
11:15 AM Ron hands me not one but 2 Torque converter seals.!!!!!!,  turn
around and drive 140 miles home and get the dang seal in and the engine
installed, tomorrow I find out if it leaks.

So far every time I have needed something and called the Depot, I have got
it and gotten it rather fast.  (ALSO unlike a lot of other sites, his can
be used in TEXT only mode)


Thanks Ron

Bob
