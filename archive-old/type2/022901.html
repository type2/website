Motor in question is a 2.0L, fuel injected Type IV. My other 2.0 Type IV is 
dual carb-ed.

The CHT gauges are VDO gauges with the little sender ring that is normally 
under the spark plug somewhere.

My problem is that about every second time I remove the spark plug, the 
sender is ruined and I'm out another $15 or so. What would be another good 
place to mount it?

I would love to mount it under a head stud but I'm told it's no good. 
Accuracy isn't a huge deal because I want to check it's status more than 
anything - is it hotter now than it has been for the past 100 miles??? that 
sort of thing.

However I would like a reasonable number to stare at.

Several folks have warned that VDO gauges are very inaccurate. I'll be 
checking mine but if they were, what is a good way to adjust them? Just 
curious.

Now for the idea - the fuel injected engine isn't as big a concern but in 
theory the carb engine could run lean on one side for some reason making 
one head run too hot while the other head (of course the head with the CHT 
sender) remained reasonably cool. I'd like to monitor both heads but with 
one gauge.

I'm sure I could add a switch but would there be a simple flip-flop circuit 
of some kind that would sample one sensor and then after a second or two 
sample the other sensor - giving the driver a fairly steady reading on the 
gauge?

In my mind, the gauge might rise and fall a little if there was much of a 
difference in head temps but might average the two temps out. Of course I 
would keep a switch nearby so I could go to one sensor or the other 
continuously if I wanted (but why - what's the point if you could read both 
sensors?).

I know this is just making something very complicated out of something that 
isn't or shouldn't be -- but just curious what you thought.
