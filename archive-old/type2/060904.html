Subject: aircooled vanagon

Hey Y'all,
  I am told this is the list for aircooled Vanagons, not the Vanagon 
list. Anyway I have a friend that came across two vanagons and is 
getting a good deal on both. One is a 5 speed deisel and the other is an 
80 aircooled I think. What I wanted to know is are there any problems 
that I should know about, he wants to sell me the A/C one. I don't know 
that much about the Vanagons. Are there parts that are really hard to 
get or really expencive that I should watch out for and make sure are 
there before I buy? I assume its a 2.0l. He said it dropped a valve. The 
valve thing is not a problem, I'm a mechanic and fix anything, but I 
would like to know if there is something I should know before doing the 
job. Are there good or bad heads to look out for?  And what is a 
reasonable price for this Vanagon? Its got a good body and interior, not 
a Westy or camper and has a dropped valve/ nonrunnig engine. Anything 
you could tell me would ge great. I would like to know good and bad so I 
don't take a blind leap into something I might regret. And no my 70 Bus 
is not going to be for sale, I'm keeping it, the vanagon will be for the 
wife. Thanks in advance.

P.S. Its has airconditioning, any problems here?
