Subject: [T2] the dreaded rear end squeak

As a follow up to earlier, I just cured the squeak on the right hand rear
end.

After pulling the big 46 mm nut I pulled out the bearings and inspected
them.

There's a pair of rubber seals to hold the grease in, and it looks like the
rear one had a high spot on it which squeaked when the shaft revolved at
slow speed. I cleaned it up, made sure it was level, put a smear of grease
on, and bolted it all back up. Problem solved, though it wasn't much of a
problem in the first place, more of an irritation. Still I'm off touring in
Europe next  week, so I won't have that to worry about.
