    Bus in question is a stock 77:
    I recently bought new heat exchangers and a new exhaust system.  Some of
you may recall an earlier post from me about the wait. I'll start by saying
I am very pleased with the heat exchangers- heavy european made units with a
good fit. I dont mind that I had to PAY for them because I feel like they
will last. My exhaust system has a lousy fit and I need advice on a good
one.
    The one piece &quot;P*cesetter&quot; brand is very affordable for a reason IMHO.
However it does resemble a stock setup in its shape.  A setup like this that
actually fit would be fine. No 4-tip etc.
    If I must bite the bullet and buy from vw, then tell me. Quality pays
everytime! If I can get a reasonable quality aftermarket(and thus save a
bundle probably), then enlighten me.  The one I was recommended by my
supplier is a letdown (though cheap cheap if you care).
Thank you
Jay Schmidt
