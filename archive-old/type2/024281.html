&gt; What is the little knob that sticks out under the drivers seat for??
&gt; not the seat adjustment knobs...but the other one... it pulls
&gt; out....sorta... then springs right back in...
&gt; 

It is to deflect the some of heat to the rear of the bus.  I don't think it is should spring back though - neither of mine do. Must be something up with the cable -- I wouldn't worry about it.
