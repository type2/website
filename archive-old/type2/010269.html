List,

Thanks for all the responses on why i shouldn't use an FI head on only one
side. For all who missed it, this applies to type4 1800-2000cc engines:
If you run an FI head on one side and a bigger-valved carbed head on the other
side, you'll have to run the engine rich to get the FI head not to run lean,
so if you can get the FI head not to run lean, the carbed side is going to run
rich - or vise versa. If you run the engine at the correct mix (by some
miracle) the fI head is going to run lean and hot = it will predetonate and
die before the carbed head.  The carbed head might create a little more power
which would eventually wear all of the internal parts of the engine unevenly
and probably run rough/out of balance the rest of its life.  One listee posted
that the thing would never time or carbuerate (sp?) right.

Anyway, don't do it unless you have to, but it does sound like a good spare to
have if you can't have the right head.  The engine will run and probably not
die early, but it wouldn't run right.
-----------------------
Cylinder ODs: the 1700s have a smaller OD, so a 1700 head would have to be cut
so an 1800cc cylinder would fit. Also - i believe the combustion chamber
shape/geometry is different (see Wilson) so even if the head was cut to accept
the diameter of the 1800 cylinder, the CR would be different.

I'm not going to have to do any of this anyway 'cause a listmember did in fact
have a spare head that is exactly what i need: an 1800 head with 41mm valves
and at least one EGR port which makes it a 74.  I'm tellin' ya man, this list
is the best thing since... since.. hell, i can't think of anything - The
invention of the wheel?  Yeah, that sounds right.

Thanks again to all who responded. All others who had heads or maybes: Thanks
for your help - i still have your address and may still need you.

Soon as i get this head, get it cleaned, hopefully it ain't cracked, etc. i'll
be ready for reassembly. Woo hoo!!!
I'll keep the list posted, of course.

Who was the guy who needed the outboard water connection?  let me know if you
didn't find it.

whole big ol' pile of thanks,

clark in ky.
