Subject: help! even more pressing than the Frontend problem!!

well folks, this morning, after telling alllabout how great she was on 
the trip here, then explaining about a kerthumping in the fontend, i go 
out to go to work, and whirwhirwhir. No startystarty. it fired maybe 5 or 
8 times all togethor during about an hours worth of cranking. so, now 
that i've switched over to my spare battery &lt;a VERY convenient spare part 
you know...&gt; and have ripped the dizzy apart, and inspected and 
reassembled, and tossed my improperlyjettedbutworks spare carb &lt;another 
usefull part to keep on hand...&gt; and still noda thing.

oh, and there was atleast an hour of sitting before i swapped carbs, 
tried it before and after...


so, after the gass that poured into the engine bay and puddled all over 
the place when the line fell over while i was getting the carb, 
evaporates, i will check to be sure i'm getting spark...and yeah, its got 
gas, and yeah, the electric fool pump os working fine...

lets see. reasons for nonstart: too cold? nah...its started fine in 
colder weather,  besides, i only had to wear my flannel to stay 
comfortable...

no gas. got it.
no gas getting to engine. should be now...
no spark. everything looked ok, but i haent made sure i'm sparking yet.
valves improperly adjusted. well, its ben about 3500 miles since last 
adjustment, BUT, these are vavles on an engine that only changes maybe 
.001 on the clearances at 4000 miles or so! a few times aorun now, so, i 
dont think that is it. besides, the day before it was fine!!
what else!

idle cutoff jet, notn existent on old carb, 'cause it was in the way of 
alternator...:) s its...bypasssed...

ont he new one, hoked up and clicking fine...



anything selse i'm just not remmebering from this happening manytimes on 
my bugs????


help save my 69 westy!!!
