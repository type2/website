Subject: Re: [T2] BN4 heater inside bus

hey guys   The gas heaters for single cabs mount if the front right in front 
of the passengers feet and knees.    I have one mounted under my middle seat 
in my 66 westy and it has worked great for many years   These heaters were also 
mounted inside on the snow cats . You just need to protect  around the heater 
 later  Mark Dearing
