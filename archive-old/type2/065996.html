Subject: Bus Restoration &lt;body/paint advice&gt;

John Chapdelaine was asking about body and paint advice for &quot;Bessie&quot; the
beloved '71 resto project...

VanBondo wisely suggests that the keys to a good body and paint job are
definition of the desired work to be completed, definition and documentation
of the time/budget/quality level and, quality body work under quality paint
materials. Bottom line is that PREPARATION is the key in both the business
and craft aspects of the job.

The questions are:
1. The very first thing is to identify your budget and the detail the extent
of the job for which you will be shopping. Document (write it down!) the
exact items to be completed, to what criteria (&quot;lick&amp;stick&quot;, average,
concourse/titty perfect), and in what amount of time you want/need/demand
that the job be completed.
2.Getting personal experience and/or references and looking at actual
restored buses from the shop is an excellent idea.
3. Checking with your local version of the Better Business Bureau or the
Atty Generals Office would be recommended.
4. shops, now-a-days, will shy away from a fixed price bid. It is more fair
to the shop (and potentially more profitable) to quote the hourly shop rate
and grind you until they are done. In the shops defense, you have to imagine
the customer who says &quot;fix this&quot; and then continues to include more and more
changes and expect the price to remain the same.
5. Due to the factors in item 3. above I **STRONGLY** advise a written
working agreement detailing all of the things to be completed, what colors,
**INCLUDING A COMPLETION DATE~!**, and for what amount of money. Make it a
formal professional document. Have all parties sign the damned thing!~ Give
every party a copy. Then lay back, let the shop do the work and be ready to
kick butt if they jerk you around. It might be a great idea to approach each
shop with this document already prepared, leaving blank spaces for them to
insert time and budget factors. If they dont want to dance then do yourself
a big-time favor and skate on down the street.
6. &lt;&lt;Flame suit on and I don't care&gt;&gt;
I don't give a flip if body and paint folks are on this list but...
It has been my experience nad the experience of several folks with whom I am
acquainted over several situations that body and paint folks are
professional flakes!!!! Yes, many are craftsmen (persons) but are notorious
for jerking customers around and are not inclined to want to conduct the
*business aspect* in a formal professional manner. From the shop owner
perspective, customers are notorious for being fickle, unreasonably
demanding, unrealistic as to appropriate budget and required time to do the job.
7.Once a deal has been struck then document the heck outta the bus prior to
anything being done. It would be a great idea to videotape you and the shop
representative inspecting the bus and stating (for the camera) EXACTLY what
will be done to each area. Tell the shop rep that they also will get a copy
of the tape. This clarifys everything up front and provides a means for
dispute resolution in the future. Any changes to the agreement as the job
progresses should be documented as well. Keep a running log of the
interaction with the shop. Think me anal as a hell but the more you document
everything is the degree to which you protect yourself. Be ready to whip out
the organized log/diary in front of the shop rep during any discussions. The
shop will get the idea that they cant jerk you around.
8. It is your job to stick to your end of the baragin as well. Constant
changes/additions to the agreement is flatly unfair to the shop unless the
budget and/or expected deadline is adjusted accordingly. Pay the shop as
agreed. Do business when you do business.
9. Of course all of these items have been learned the hard way. You may find
a shop that is able and motivated to do a fine job in short order for a fair
(to both parties) budget. I was not so lucky my first time around. Another
person I know spun through FIVE body and paint shops and spent 2X of what I
did in order to get their VW's bodywork done right and painted. What I spent
about made me barf but is low as I check around.
Good Luck,
