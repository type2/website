Subject: Timing Help?'s

I am ATTEMPTING to set my timing right and was reading up on the procedure in 
the Bentley Manual, then went outside to see what the part # on my dizzy was 
and it turned out to be 231 178 009 (050  Z42?)which was not in the Bentley 
under the section on timing, at least not in my version. All I wasnt is the 
specs set it up right. I am also suspecting that this motor is out of a bug 
(heater boxes are) but I'm not certain and if some body out there could tell me 
where this motor came from based on the engine (AS) #111 101 102D it also had a 
#37 right next to the VW symbol on the case before the engine #. If also 
someone could tell me the reference pub that tells this engine # info so I will 
not have to ask this same question for another motor I have would also be 
appreciated. Two more questions, there are two kinds of timing light in the 
auto stores and I am not certain on which one to get. If someone could tell me 
a good brand/model to buy would be great. And lastly this motor whatever it may 
be has no degree scale behind the crank pulley, is it supposed to have one, 
because if so thats just one more thing I will have to buy before ATTEMPTING 
this procedure. Thanks all
