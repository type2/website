Subject: Re: [T2] clip on icebox cabinet?

&gt; &gt; What is this clip for on the icebox cabinet?  I
&gt; &gt; cannot figure out
&gt;
&gt; There should be a nylon strap with a buckle connected
&gt; your westy stool, this strap hooks through this clip
&gt; in the picture to create a baby-sized little bed with
&gt; the jump seat and the stool making up the top surface
&gt; of the bed.  I have a picture of this in my Westy
&gt; Manual, I see if I can get it scanned and post it.

OK heres some real minutae.
When did Westfalia change from the leather strap to a nylon strap?

No. I dont know. I bet Karl does though.
