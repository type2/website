I seem to recall a Hoover sermon where he was suggesting mounting the
cooler on the left battery tray, arguing that the overpressure from the
scoops would keep air flowing OUT through the cooler, and thus not
pre-heat the enging cooling air.  I think this plan also involved an
electric fan, which would operate at idle, when there would not be any
overpressure.  For my part, I recall thinking of going this route but
building some kind of box/plenum with a flap system to keep air from
being suck INTO the engine compartment through the cooler.  Or was it
Hoover who suggested this?  I forget now where that idea came from --
maybe from my own brain, maybe not.

&quot;I don't have a thermostat on the oil system. If you live where it gets
cold at all, you should install one.&quot;

This got me thinking: would it be possible to install some kind of
manual shunt to send the oil to the cooler when the oil temp guage shows
hot oil?  A couple of ball valves might work; though having two valves
to operate opens the possibility of accidentally closing the one to the
cooler but not opening the shunt back to the engine.

Anyway, here's a QUESTION FOR THE LIST: would an appropriate manual
and/or thermostatic valve/shunt be available in my local self-service
junkyard?  I'm allergic to spending good money on cheapo parts when good
used ones can be had for next to nothing.

Anyway, I recommend the junkyard as the source for a fan, if you decide
to go that route.  There's a nice selection of 'em usually.  :  )

Also, speaking of junkyards and oil coolers, I should mention that my
plans for an oil cooler, should I decide to go that route, would
probably involve using a stock type I-III or type IV oil cooler, using
the mounting plate from an Audi (See the Ron Van Ness page at
http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/oilcool.htm).
