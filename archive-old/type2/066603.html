Subject: How many miles on your bus

        Little Martha ('70 single cab) just wrapped around '10000'. 
Probably 210,000, but maybe 110,000. I'm the sixth owner and it had the 
rubber caps on the brake bleeders when I bought it, so the lower figure 
is POSSIBLE. I don't think 310,000 is likely, given the generally good
condition of the vehicle.

        My friend Dopson bought 3 splities for $1-200 each in the
70s and made one runner out of them- the chassis he was using had
315,000 on it last I remember. 

        Sold my '77 Rabitt with 209,000, still running strong but
beginning to need paint. Sold the '85 Golf with 137,000- barely
broken in.

        Happy Motoring!
        Bill
