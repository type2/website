Subject: What's your word on brake bleeding tools?

I'm in the mood to buy a new tool.  Anybody have one of those bleeder pumps
for the brakes?  Sure looks a lot better than having your kids pumping the
pedal while you sqaut over a peanut butter jar with tubing dangling in it.

OR...  I was in a FLAPS and they were selling replacement bleeder screws
with a tiny check valve in them.  Just open them up a turn and pump (I guess
you're back to having help...hmmmm) until you get a steady stream and shut
it off.  Looks neat, cheaper than a pump and you don't have to remember
where you put it.

Comment?
