&gt; My rebuilt 1600 dp with CW crank, balanced fully,smoothed intake and
exhaust
&gt; ports, and extractor exhaust needs a little more OOMPH at highway speeds.
I
&gt; am thinking about dual Kadrons and 1.25 ratio rocker arms. Anyone have an
&gt; opinion (boy, that's a loaded statement)on the effect these mods would
have?
&gt; Would they affect reliability?Any help or information would be greatly
&gt; appreciated. TBear
&gt;
&gt; Don't take life too seriously - you'll never live through it.
