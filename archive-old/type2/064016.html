Subject: vw jamboree.  late, but....

well, i just though i would repost my thoughts on the classic from last
weekend.  first one did not ever get up here.

anyway, the show was the typical jamboree.  ok and getting worse every
time.  intershow just does not put on a good show anymore.  the low point
was the fact that they had a category for hondas and the likes with loud
sterios.  strange thing to see at a vw show.  oh well, i just ignored
them.  most of the vehicles there were custome bugs and such.  the parts
section, well let's just say that there wasn't much.

there was a good turn out of bus folks though.  all kinds too.  i spoke
with a few folks from the list.  it was great to meet you all.  there were
about 20 bus's there.  mostly none stock, but i don't mind as long as
they are not hack jobs.

i was there showing my crew cab and also trying to sell it.  i was entered
in the vintage type II calss which put me up against all the other bus's.
i was real bummed about that.  no comertial class.  oh well, i had the
fortion of having a nice bus to show and wound up winning 1st.  cool.

did not sell the crew, but got some offers.  i hope to try again at pomona
this weekend.  if not there, then i will try a few more times untill i
hold off till next year.  i hope i find a good home soon. 

if you are comming down for a so. cal show, make it the classic, not a
jamboree.  you will have more fun and maybe find some parts.

Take care and God Bless
matt
