Subject: Re: [T2] simple head replacement

Unless every piece of the engine is brand new (and, if you're cautious, even
then) you should measure all relevant components - deck height, volume of
combustion chambers, volume of dish in piston - to correctly calculate CR's
and shim appropriately.

Bus Depot and others have shims for a heck of a lot less than that, though
not that exact equivalent.  That 1.6mm shim works out to about .06&quot;;
depending on the circumstances I might be tempted to &quot;stack 'em up&quot; to that
height.

I've used Permatex Form-a-Gasket for the adhesive (thick brown goo in small
can) though others swear by other aftermarket gasket adhesives.  Essentially
you coat the shim(s) before sliding them on to the barrel to help prevent
oil leaks.

Subject: [T2] simple head replacement


&gt; I'd like to replace a head (another bus), and I was wondering what is
required beyond the obvious remove all and replace all. According to the
technote...
&gt;
&gt; http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/techbull.html
&gt;
&gt; ...a shim goes in if it's not already there. VW still has the shims at
7.88 each but what is used for adhesive D 000 400?
&gt;
&gt; How do I apply the adhesive?
&gt;
&gt; Is there a cheaper source for the shim?
&gt;
&gt; Anything else I need to know?
