I gave this a second look:

&gt; &gt; Basic newtonian laws of motion  (rendered into a mathematical form) state
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; S=ut   ft**2/2

I'd write it as: S=So+VoT+(1/2)aT^2, which is basically the same thing.

&gt; &gt; where s is distance, u is intitial velocity, f is the acceleration,
and t is the time
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; so given that 60mph = 88feet per second
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 167 = 88t - 23t**2/2
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; solving the resulting quadratic (11.5t**2 - 88t   167 = 0) gives
(approximately)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; t = -0.8 or 8.5

I think that you need to check your solution.  I get

t=4.17s or t=3.48s

Which is the answer we want?  I'm not so sure!  They fall on opposite
sides of the number arrived at earlier.  I really think that we are simply
going in circles around the data!  :)
