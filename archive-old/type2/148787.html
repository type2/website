Subject: RE: [T2] Enigine hesitates, sputters and dies on highway.

Beginning to think it might be something entirely different.  Replaced Temp
Sensor II.  Originally was slightly out of spec for resistance readings so
since I had a new one on hand I dropped it in anyway.  Checked and replaced
some vacuum connections (30 year old connectors about to crumble to dust),
double relay, AFM, etc.  All checked out fine per Bently and Idiot's.

Started her up to do a lap around the neighborhood.  Came up to speed fine
in first, shifted to second, and Whoa Nelly!  The lurching is back.
Starting to think this falls under the &quot;Slips and Jerks&quot; category.

Clutch plate?  Flywheel maybe?

Cheers,

Duke
