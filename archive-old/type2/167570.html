&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you think you got the valves adjusted correctly? Valves not closing
&gt; &gt; &gt; all the way could cause a problem like that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; have readjusted them loose, tight, very loose, very tight and everywhere
&gt; &gt; in between!!  got the other 3 cyl right on the first try,. besides these
&gt; &gt; are hyd lifters they work if they are even close....and I hear the leak
&gt; &gt; when compresion testing...
&gt;
&gt; I think that you have diagnosed the problem.  The valve is not seating for
&gt; some reason.  Might be a tight stem, bent valve, poor valve grinding job,
&gt; poor lapping job, etc.  Unfortunately, the only way to tell is to pull the

didn't even have to do that, put hand over intake and crank engine, blows
back out the intake.

apparently the valve is seating some time and not others, thus the high
compresion reading one time then the next nada.  probably why the engine
ran occasionally then stopped dead.
