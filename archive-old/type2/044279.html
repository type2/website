Subject: [T2] westfalia middle seat

List,
I am curious to know about the middle seat that was available on the later 
westfalias. The one that goes in between the front seats. I was wondering 
how difficult it would be to install one of those in my 1969 SO-67. Drilling 
holes, if necessary, is not a concern of mine. I am also curious about the 
seat belt, if any. How difficult are these to find, and are they expensive? 
Are there any alternatives? Thanks!
