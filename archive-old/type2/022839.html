Subject: Looking for icebox part
Message-ID: &lt;4fef38dd.247ab515_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Dear list,

I am trying to find the ice tray (that holds the block of ice to keep things 
&quot;cool&quot; in there) for my 1971 Campmobile icebox.  I have the rack (with the 
&quot;guardrails&quot; all around it) and I am wondering if there's any other hardware 
that goes inside the icebox.  I contacted the folks at Euro American RV (at 
deltasix_at_earthlink_dot_net) and they couldn't help me.  They did have a new pump 
to replace my leaky one, but I had requested a repair kit (no such luck).  
Any of you guys have any tips on repairing a leaky faucet pump?  Thanks.
