Subject: RE: [T2] Is a aircooled vanagon ECU different between automatic
   and  manual transmissions?

&gt; &gt; I know in the Bay window busses they had different ECU's....I figure this
&gt; &gt; probably had something to do with duration of the injector pulse, or
&gt; &gt; something..........

&gt; I was once told by my rebuilder that an ECU from an auto would work fine in
&gt; a manual, but that he wasn't sure if the opposite would work....

I had a Manual ECU in my auto 78 once for a couple months when I couldn't
find an auto ECU.....seemed to work alright, the auto ECU worked better
though.
