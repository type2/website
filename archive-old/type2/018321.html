Hi Volks,

sorry for the John Farnham subject line but it
seems so fitting.

Last night a heavy thunderstorm hit my home town
Braunschweig, Germany, and on its climax I decided
to drive home in my '72 panel van.  Under a
railway bridge, where the street goes down, 
suddenly everyone ahead of me swerved onto the left
lane.  I thought, &quot;Great!&quot;, and went past them
on the right.

Only to find myself bumper-deep in muddy water
coming the other way at faster a speed than I was
going.  Stalled cars everywhere.  Police setting 
up a roadblock on the other side.  Well.

Some cars do make it.  Some cars don't.  VW Buses,
as I found out, do.

At the next filling station, everyone was poking
around in their engine bays, quizzically eyeing
their dizzys and stuff, while I was cleaning my
windows from the inside -- they'd fogged rapidly
with the heater on.  Minor flaw.

Gotta love the bus.  Next oil change will be done
this weekend, ahead of schedule -- who knows what
got into there.  And it's earned itself one :-)

Just needed to tell you.  Thanks for listening.

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
