&gt; &gt; Has anyone found a good 13mm box end wrench for adjusting valves.
&gt; &gt; I've tried several, none have a really good fit, and the angle seems awkward.
&gt; &gt; Consequently, the nuts are rounding off with each adjustment.
&gt; &gt; thanks Crisp

&gt; I use a socket to break em loose and final tighten back up to torque.  so
&gt; actual adjusting is done with basically anything, even your fingers if
&gt; engine is cool.

I have good luck with a stubby screwdriver and a box wrench.  13mm for
most engines, 15mm for Mexican engines.
