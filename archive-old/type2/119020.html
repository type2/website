Subject: Re: [T2] Re: pressure relief tool

completely.

I'll add that I've always seen an oil pressure increase, and most of it
noticably occurring at idle or very low RPMs. The piston and piston
seating/sealing surface are usually in dire need of cleanup. This is normal
even if it's a new case, let alone a used one with 200k miles (those are
REALLY rough).
