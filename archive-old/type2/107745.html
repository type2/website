Subject: PLEASE- I need a pic of roof rack mounted to your pop top

I have all the stuff ready to install my Thule roof rack to my pop top. I've
weighed the options of wind resistance and the possibility of cracking the
top, but I'm willing to press on.
However, I would like to see a few pictures of how people mounted theirs to
the artificial gutters and how they bolted the artificial gutter onto the pop
top. I'm going to mount mine on top of the pop top instead of on the side
because I have narrow bars. I'm not really sure which way they are to face
(Yakima's artificial gutters are the same too).
I also want to put something on the underside to help spread the pressure.
I've thought of a thin block of wood, big washers, and a piece of metal to go
on before the nuts- what have others used?

If you don't have pics, I'd appreciate a detailed description.

Thanks a million,

Nik
