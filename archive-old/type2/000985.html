Dear Folks,

Hi there... I'm havin a problem with my starter. I checked the library and
did what Sean Bartnik says and my starter seems to be ok. Could'nt get into
the archives cause the server was probaly down for some update. The starter
was rebuild bout 3 month ago and now that i finished my engine rebuild it
won't start the engine(the engine rebuild last bout 3 month's). It cranks
but it seems not having enough power to turn the engine. Also i swapped my
engine! I used to have a 1600' &quot;torque(60hp)&quot; engine and now i have a
2000'cc T4. Is my starter gonna be able to turn a T4 engine under full
compresion ratio? Rings are new, valves, guides, sattles and crankcase.
Yesterday i tearded down the starter and checked it. After tryin for some
days to start the engine the starter overheated and the soldering points on
the colector where gone... They soldered the wires of the induced
(inducido?? sorry don't know the word) to the colector with a normal
soldering gun. New starters have the wires somehow another way conected to
the colector so they wont come of when the starter overheats. Well i
soldered the wires to the colector, checked the starter and all parts of it
for short circuits and it was ok. My solenoid is new and works perfectly.
Right now the starter spins fine when i conect the starter directly to the
battery (without the solenoid) but when i crank it with the key it cranks
half around and the stops. Looks like there's  too much compresion on my
cylinders and the starter hesitates...
Does anyone tried to start a T4 engine with a T2 starter???
Does it work and just i'm getting trouble here?
