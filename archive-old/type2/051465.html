   Well, le'see, I went 220 k in my 71 Westy, with 2 rebuilds and a new
case along the way.  It was a while ago when I retired it around 1984,
but I remember quite a bit of wear in the adjustor tips and on the valve
stem ends.  All that &quot;tap-tap-tapping tends to add up! also, that play
makes the solid lifters wear down where the cam hits.
   I just pulled a few adjustors on my 78 with 221 k on it, never
rebuilt.  The adjustors look a little shiny in the center but are still
nicely rounded, not flattened or mushroomed!  I have pulled a lifter
when redoing seals around 200K, and they looked just shiny. Replacing
one is not a big deal.   The larger heater boxes on the later type 2's
make putting the valve covers back on
more of a pain.  Adjusting the valves 10 times a year compared to
checking them as I do about every 25K is no comparison in my book.  The
only thing I miss is not knowing if your valve is stretching or your
seat pounding in until it may be too late.  MB
