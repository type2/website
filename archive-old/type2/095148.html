Subject: horn confusion

Ok, I've read all of the archives, and looked at the bentley, but i =
still cant figure this horn out.  What am I missing?
There are 2 wires that connect to the horn.  There is a wire that runs =
down through the steering column and looks to be in contact with one of =
the bolts that connects the steering column to the steering box. =20
If i get under the bus I can see another wire with a female spade =
connector that I'm guessing connects to the steering box so that the =
circuit is completed when I push the horn button, but I just can't =
figure out where it connects. Any advice?
