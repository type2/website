Subject: Re: [T2] Head problems again/911 engine?

&gt; There are newer T4 aftermarket heads from Spain (AMC), and LOTS of

&gt; Partly driving style, partly fuel; at least as far as I can tell.

not sure if it is helping but I only use name brand fuels and nothing less
than 89 octane in my 78 bus, I also lowered the Compression Ratio a tad
when I rebuilt the engine about 5 years ago

not sure if it is helping but can't hurt I don't think

I'll get back to you in another 10 years to let you know how the heads are
doing....
