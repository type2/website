Subject: Parts: Get em now!

I am taking first dibs for parts off of my 79 parts bus. It is going down to
Busted Bus after this weekend.

Photos are on http://misterstiles.multiply_dot_com

The only thing I can't get rid of is the front/rear suspension cause it
needs to be towed. Most everything else is up for grabs. Just offer me a
fair price and I'll ship it anywhere at the buyers expense/request. The 2.0L
engine is still intact. Missing is the transmission and brakes/booster.

After this weekend, you can contact Chris at Busted Bus. parts_at_bustedbus_dot_com

Feel free to give me a call or email.

The bus is located in Westminster, Colorado close to Denver and Boulder.

Happy! Happy! Joy! Joy!
