Subject: Re: [T2] setting off car alarms

I have a '78 that is &quot;loud and proud&quot; its all a muffler/heat exchanger
thing.
are you back firing at all??
chances are there is a gap/hole some where!!
have you done the wet towel in the tail pipe test yet???
1) stick wet towel in tail pipe creating a complete block
2) turn on bus.
3) if bus runs normaly/ near normal you have aleak/hole/gap
4) if bus stalls out (this is prefferabl)  then the problem is some where
else.

on a side note
I LOVE SETING OFF PEOPLES CAR ALARMS w/ MY BUS!!!

Mike
'78 Bus
