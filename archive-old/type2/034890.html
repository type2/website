Subject: Weird Wires

Hi list, 

I have been removing some of  the dash wiring today in anticipation of
replacing the front panel and came across something that strikes me as a
bit odd. There are three different switches upfront. The light switch, the
hazard light switch and a third. This one has never worked and so I don't
know what it did. Today I found it has only two wires, a live red which
goes to the fusebox and a brown, that later becomes blue with red spots.
This second wire goes up the side of the windscreen and then down towards
the back of the bus. The PO though  must have thought it was useless as
they cut it. What is it? Where does it go? It is a 73 westy, British
registered. Any ideas?

Thanks
