Subject: Westfalia Tent Questions Part 2

Greetings Fellow VW People!

I am still contemplating purchasing a side tent for my Westfalia.  The one I
am considering is perfect.  It has the original bags (nice and clean),
poles, etc.  It even has the original instructions to go with it.

Here's my dilemma.  For those of you that have these nice options on your
Westfalias, are they worth it?  Are they something that you would use a lot?
Or are they more trouble than they are worth?

I'm thinking that they make a wonderful room to get you OUT of the bus when
camping.  I mean let's face it, there's only so much usable room in a
Westfalia.

Please let me know what you think.

Also, what is a reasonable price for a perfect tent?  I have never seen one
that is so clean and complete.

Thanks,
Victor
