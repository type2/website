&gt; &gt; as you can tell, this is one of pet peeves. why people think it is easier

&gt; You don't think that having a more reliable and forgiving engine is
&gt; worth the time and effort in the long run?

you would put more time, money, effort into something else than a full
rebuild to a bus engine.  (mark my words)
&gt;
&gt; Granted, if I had a fresh 1700-2000 I wouldn't be considering this.
&gt; But I have a fresh Toyota engine that I'm saving from the scrapyard.
&gt; To me this, along with the obvious benefits of the Toyota engine, is
&gt; worth it. That and the fact that low mileage replacements are
&gt; available for a few hundred dollars and I can drive 40 minutes up the
&gt; freeway to pick it up.

still wouldn't do it unless you have done many engine swaps with stock to
know how they work, and have experience or money to back up the work when
you find the inevitable glitches (and no list to ask questions of)

&gt; Mounting the rad isn't as big a deal as I had initially thought when
&gt; first considering this. The radiator from the Celica fits quite nicely
&gt; where the engine hatch is. A bit of sheet metal and fiberglass to
&gt; pretty it up and it will just look like a bulge in the back. Nothing
&gt; up front (or on top).

the area in the back of a bus is a dead zone, no air flow. little cooling
why do you think that VW put air intakes on the side of the bus..??

&gt; Water heat &gt; heat exchanger heat.

how cold is it where you are, getting and putting in a gas heater is
easier

&gt; More and smoother power.

the 2liter engine is adequate,  much more power and you have to start
messing with the brakes, suspension etc.
if done right the type IV engine can be very smoooth

&gt; EVERY auto parts store carries parts for the Toyota engines. Only a
&gt; few odds and ends are available for the T4 unless I want to drive 30
&gt; +_ minutes to another store.

Bus Depot
BustedBus
and a whole bunch of others.

&gt; 20R vibrations will actually be worse than the T4. I'm thinking about
&gt; options to alleviate that including dampeners. I'll have to see after
&gt; the engine's installed.

?????
&gt;
&gt; I'm sure there are more reasons to convert, but they aren't coming to
&gt; mind. But you get the idea.

there are also a lot of reasons not to
&gt;
&gt; I normally would think it was stupid too, except the benefits are
&gt; great! And not having to adapt another transaxle to the bus is the
&gt; clincher.

I'm an engineer remember

&quot;it will take 4 times as long
  cost twice as much
   have half the benifits as planned&quot;
