&gt; i asked a few days ago how to get the  ecc. bushings off of the upper ball

&gt; i ran by a shop with the torsion arms in hand,  we went back to a 50 ton
&gt; press, i held on to the arm and we supported under the bushing w/ shim stock
&gt; and the press pushed on the ball joint arm.  when it finally let loose, the
&gt; second one was at about 6 tons force (bent the shim stock) (we both did not
&gt; look at the gauge on the first one but it was similar). i could never have
&gt; gotten that loose w/ ANY hand tool, as i was told on this list.
&gt; once again, thank you all so much.  as soon as i have time and the weather
&gt; breaks we are back on the road!

Mike:
A big hammer will move the same things as a 10 ton press.
Heat and a hammer in the right hands will do a lot. (It will also booger
up a lot if  you don't know what you're doing. I know this from
experience.) :^(
Glad you got your ball joints in successfully, though!
