Subject: Re: [T2] RE: alternative heat source


Yeah thats great and all but I umm sort of live in Northern Virginia and
doubt I'll be hunting for bus parts in Alaska any time soon. But thanks for
the tip. I am still deciding between the BA4 and BA 6 and a new Espar
heater. My brother is a dealer for Espar in Annapolis and installs them in
boats, however they run on diesel. I got fairly decent heat from my stock
system with a bilge blower. But the gas would really make things toasty and
I could run it with the engine off while camping.  Lots of pros and cons
here.

BA4 more readily available? Parts easier to find?
BA6 more BTU easier to install in a '78 Westy
Espar brand new, reliable, easy to get serviced, diesel safer than gas...
BA4 have to relocate aux battery and do a lot of cutting and welding to
install
BA6 have to find one first then hope I can get everthing else I would need
for a stock looking install.
Espar $$$, have to also install a diesel tank and all the plumbing for fuel
and exhaust...

In the end I'll probably just end up buying more sweaters :-)

If you ever drive to Alaska, and you see a dead bus sitting in a yard,
pull over and take a look in the engine compartment.

Those dead buses up there just about all have heaters in them waiting to be

plucked.
