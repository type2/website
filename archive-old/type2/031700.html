&gt; valve seats in T4 engines and overheating.  I spoke with my old partner Matt

&gt; like selling rebuilt T4 engines &quot;because 50% lost valve seats within 40K
&gt; miles&quot;.  Tom Noble said the same and that he voided any warranty if the jugs
&gt; were blue. These were regularly serviced, stock grocery getter T4 Buses and
&gt; campers.
&gt; 
&gt; Have you guys any similar experience and/or come up with a cure?

the cure is to swage the valve seats after instalation

have never (knock on wood etc) had a swaged valve seat drop
