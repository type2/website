Subject: Anyone Interested?

Hello, I recently purchased a 75 Transporter for $500 dollars naively
assuming that if it ran and the body looked good I was getting a deal.  I
had this fantasy of being an empowered female who could fix it up herself
not realizing that they switched to fuel injection, and what little I did
know about engines was exhausted when I couldn't find a carb anywhere. 
Much to my dismay and my boyfriends annoyed amusement I was told it needs
a lot more help than I can give it.  I'm keeping my eye out now for a
'71, but am hoping to re-coup my $500.  Any thoughts?  Any takers?  I
don't have the space to part it out myself unfortunately.  Body is in
pretty good shape.  Problems are no compression in 2 cylinders and very
little in other 2, bad CV joints, oil leaks, odd idle, most of hoses for
cooling are missing.  A/C and cruise have been disconnected - probably
for their own good.  Like I said though it looks pretty good, and still
gets around for me.  Feel free to Email me off the list or on.           
       Jesse in Minneapolis
