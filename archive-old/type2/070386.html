Subject: Drink holder

Being a Potter, I was able to make a great drink holder for myself.  Perhaps you
can find a local potter to make one for you.   It sits on the floor between the
seats and has place for two beverages.  Design is as follows .  Base is a
rectangular slab with walls about 3/4 inch high.  Sitting on the second level is
another rectangular slab with walls all around and lots of holes to let liquid
drip into the lower level (drip resevoir) So spills drain into the reservoir and
I clean the whole thing out periodically.  Also have a circular wall on the top
shelf to hold cokes.  Very obscure instructions.  But it works for me.  John
