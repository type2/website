Subject: Tire ?

I had a tire blowout on the way home from the CCC trip this past weekend.  I 
have the Michelin XZX 185SR14 reinforced but I can't seem to find them.  The 
tire place I go to said that he didn't think they were made anymore but still 
has one in stock ( I need two as they had 30K miles on them, the front are 
Sumitomos w/ 15K on them).   I'd like to stick w/ Michelin but is there another 
'part' they make for vanagons?
