&gt; At least i think it is a tranny issue.  Here is the story.
&gt; A real 'risen from the dead' bus story.
&gt; 
&gt; 82 passenger van..............Stood up for about 3 years.  i put in used
&gt; engine i had (120+ lbs compression on all cylinders....I pumped the lifters,
&gt; put new seals, etc.......endplay good, so did not split the case ) it is
&gt; timed correctly and valves are adjusted fine.  I have drained and replaced
&gt; the tranny fluid, and cleaned the screen................did not have a
&gt; replacement at the time. Screen had a little brass in it but nothing major.
&gt; It runs pretty good at idle, and the tranny is not slipping or
&gt; anything............when i go from a stop, it drives with normal vanagon
&gt; power until 15mph, and then it shifts to second, where it is real
&gt; slow..........the rpms are sounding normal, not like anything is slipping,
&gt; but REAL slow up until about 35 mph, where it starts to pick up a little
&gt; better.  BUT then at around 40 mph, it shifts to 3rd.  same
&gt; story..............slow to 60 mph, even the slightest hill slows the van
&gt; down some.  Top speed I was able to get out of it was about 65 mph, on a
&gt; flat.

sounds like a 2/3 brake band slip or servo problem, make sure you have
sufficient ATF in the tranny, remember it is checked with engine warm and
with tranny in N.  put on parking brake then slowly shift thru all the
gears P-R-N-D-2-1-2-D-N-R-P-R-N then check......should be between the
marks.
