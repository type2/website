Subject: Re: [T2] Type IV oil cooler on a type 1 motor

&gt; Just for the record, a type IV oil cooler will fit a type 1 motor (with a
&gt; doghouse shroud) with a few modifications.  You need to replace the 3 oil
&gt; cooler mounting studs with the longer ones from a type IV.  And you need to
&gt; modify the doghouse shroud to fit over it.  The best way is to cut the shroud
&gt; and weld in a little more material (or use fiberglass if you're not a welder).
&gt; But I know from experience that you can shove a couple of 2x4's into the oil
&gt; cooler area and beat the snot out of them.  This will have the ugly effect of
&gt; tearing the metal, but RTV red silicone is an amazingly versatile filler :)

When making mods like this, think about the poor guy that has to work on
your creation afterward.  I certainly hope that the previous &quot;mechanics&quot;
of my bus feel a small pain every time I have found, cursed, and repaired
their &quot;innovations&quot;.

I think that the type 4 cooler mod is probably a good thing, and it isn't
all that hard to do correctly.  If you aren't a welder, you can still
space the housing out with strips of metal and pop-rivet the thing in
place in a workmanlike manner.  Don't forget that you will also have to
modify the ductwork tin to match!
