&gt; OK, I got the wiring figured out on my 12 V SW gas
&gt; heater. I hooked it all up and it fired and got HOT
&gt; right away. However, as it continued to run, it did
&gt; not cycle correctly and eventually thr air started to
&gt; blow cool. Turn it off for 15 minutes, restart it, and
&gt; sam thing, gets HOT then peters out to blowing cool
&gt; air.

does the switch work? This is the little device that the temp control
cable is connected to. it should also have a metal &quot;coil&quot; that fits in
the output air stream. when heated it turns the plastic lever on the
outside and activates the switch. so it should cycle on and off. try
moving the temp adjustment the other way and see what happens. also
what might be happening is the safety sensor on the body might be
tripping w/ that much running and after 15 minutes it resets itself.
