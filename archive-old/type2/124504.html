Subject: NaturalBus 2004..Longish Report

WhoooooooooHooooo!
What a wonderful weekend.  To a guy that absolutely love's the South Eastern
mountains of America, being able to travel across the range in a 20 mph up
the mountain VW Bus, and being able to take every little squiggly red road,
this man had an absolute blast.
Thursday was a wonderful day to travel.  Taking Rte 60 across WV, it was 3
miles up an 8% grade, 3 miles down, 3 miles back up and 3 on down, and this
happened maybe 3 times.
Into Virginia, just plain beautiful scenery.  Traveling by yourself, for 8-9
hours, without a radio, affords plenty of opportunity for deep self
reflection.
I arrived early enough at Yogis place, established camp, and commenced to
build a small personal fire.  Nite fall hit hard and it was time to rest for
a big weekend.
I was awaken to the sound of pitter patter very early, maybe 4ish am, and
just wasn't going to get out.  I figured everything would get wet anyway, no
need to hurry at this point.  I am the master of the understatement.  I
don't believe it quit raining until Sat am....
Early Friday, my camping companions arrived.  It was very exciting yet
fearful, wondering who was exactly gonna slip in beside me.  Then I saw em,
and knew I was in trouble!  Once again, I was delighted by a family, full of
bus camping aficionados, who maneuvered and manipulated till they found just
the perfect angle and spot for the 3 tents...?? 3 tents?? WOW!  I was graced
by the presence of  Mad Uncle Dave and Crazy Aunt Sherry Jersey and family
(never really saw the youngins...must be a good sign)  What a  wonderful
family and great camping partners.
Most of Friday was spent by a burning desire (no pun intended) for a fire.
My dilemma?  I had enough wood to get it started, but nothing to sustain.
Yes, there was a mountain of wood at the community pit (thanx Bill!) but I
figured it was much too wet and too big 'a chunks.  And then Uncle Dave
mentioned how he loved to split wood.  Well now, we have a team! Uncle Dave
made a workable pile out of that mountain, and we built a fire.  A few
blasts from the turbo blaster, and we had flame.  Ahhh, but for only a
minute.  It truly was much to wet.  So we took the fire apart, and started
again.  This time, just a few pieces and splinters, each adding his own
special piece in his own special place.  And soon we had, a blaze.
The rains continued, and harder they came.  A few brave souls wandered to
the community pit, mainly see the knuckleheads that were standing in the
downpour.  But we had a secret.  The fire was so big and so hot, it dried
the rain before it ever hit the ground.  Until midnight that is, and the
heavy rains set in.  It was just me and Matt (brother of Jeff and Grace) and
he was quite the trooper.  It was a competition, neither wanting to be the
first to leave, but then again Matt is a rookie, and I was left tending the
fire alone.
Saturday was spent feeding the masses at breakfast (the Tennessee boyz
pretty much headed up this event with assistance) and everyone was fed.
Made a small batch of chili, mainly for my good friend Alexandra, and then
it was social hour.  Made the rounds and before you know it, it was putt
putt time.  meandered down to the tract, and was recruited by my camping
compadre MUD, and we were joined by his lovely bride Aunt Sherry and Lou.
What a team we were.  We discovered that when the ball made a &quot;boing&quot; sound,
like bouncing off an ill placed VW hubcap, that it was not gonna be good.
If they kept tally of the times we hit a hubcap, Aunt Sherry would
definitely have been the champion.
Dinner was most excellent, an awesome array of pasta dishes and
miscellaneous pleasures.  The awards and door prizes were given, and there
certainly were a few Happy campers!  Ray and Shirley (hi guys!) won best
campsite, and Jamie Auch (way to go coach) won the engine.  It was said he
had smiles as big as West Virginia when he won, but I say he sure looked
guilty.  Hmmm, wonder if there is anything to that?  Mark Dearing made some
awesome prizes and awards, a fantastic Natural Bus Hill Billy Putt Putt
Champion plate, and it is treasured.
The evening fire was a spectacle in itself, I believe there was 3 half cases
that were thrown on the fire.  Still seeing a bright spot... Dave Jersey
kept the crowds in awe and back from the pit, believe me.  Another spectacle
of a fire Saturday Evening, with a lot of help from folks, who had to throw
a log on just for the heck of it!
Made a few new friends, reaquainted with a few others.  It is an awesome
feeling to drive 400 miles and camp with such a wonderful group.
There was a family that was obviously not VW folks camping when I arrived.
After awhile everyone warmed up and she was asking where form from and such,
and then she summed it all up when she asked...
&quot;You drove that far, just for this??

Yes ma'am I did!!

Until next time campers,
