Volks,

Well, first, I have not stopped it because I am not &quot;on duty&quot; this week.
But! Even if I were I would not have.  The list policy has always been
that we welcome vendors, we support vendors, but we do not shield vendors.
Neither do we shield purchasers.  The list has always been open to reports
of &quot;bad apples&quot;, vendor or buyer.

To Buyers:

If you buy something and you have a complaint, while:
a) I urge you to try to settle it with the vendor before going public and
b) I *require* that you be civil in your complaint, 
the list is definitely a forum to air it.

To Vendors:

This works both ways.  If you sent something to someone and they didn't
pay, let me know.  or post about it.  This goes for both large and small
vendors.  (If you have bought something from someone on the list and have
not yet paid... this may be the time to write a check!!!)  At the very
least, if someone is accepting mechandise and not paying, I don't have to
let them continue to prey on *this* list!

I would love for the world to be a perfect place, but I know it isn't.
At least we can keep the imperfections down, and correct them where we
can.

                           H Steven Dolan
