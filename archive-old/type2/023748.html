Hi volks,

&gt; Yup, I'd agree with this. Things get more marginal in a genuinly hot
&gt;climate but the stock system is pretty sound if it's properly maintained.
 
 and David replied:
&gt; I still think the stock cooling system is underengineered.  I have no
doubt that my engine would 
&gt; melt down in short order if I held it at 79mph for any length of time.
This would require full
&gt; throttle and nearly 5000rpm in my bus.  I have a new engine compartment
seal, functioning 
&gt; thermostat, and all seals in place.  It was also my understanding that
redline for a 2-liter bus
&gt;  motor is 4400rpm.  I'm sure it's higher for the Porsche engines.  My
engine has never seen 
&gt; 5000rpm, much less 5200 or 5400.  It does just fine at 65mph/3900rpm
though.
 
 Well, I think it's certainly true that your engine will last longer with
this treatment. There
doesn't seem to be any debate about that, though it's possible that the
contributors to
this discussion have different expectations of longevity.
 
 I'm not sure about the numbers you quote, though. I have calculated and
measured
the rpms in my bus at 80mph and got about 4500 both ways. We had some debate
not long back about what the redline should be for a pancake engine and I
don't think
we reached a concensus- I have gathered from various sources that the rev
limiting
rotors on a pancake dizzy are nominally 5200 (though I can't be sure of
that) and
I think I asserted during the discussion that IMHO this would be consistant
with a
redline around 4750-5000 rpm.I don't think I've come across any official
figure,
though.
 I've been running my bus at this sort of speed for fairly long runs without
any signs
of trouble. I clearly recall, from my youth, laden VW vans arriving back at
my
parent's warehouse after a long haul up a motorway gradient with a heavy
load and
the engine popping and pinging as it cools down- I've never got mine that
hot, no
matter how hard I drive it. those vans were usually sold after two or three
years with
around a hundred thousand miles on them- they obviously lasted at least that
long
despite being overloaded and driven flat out (in a country that's less than
flat). A 
Westy is never going to be that heavily laden unless you carry building
materials
in it all the time!
 To get to 80 on the flat does need full throttle, or close to it- That's
what you'd expect
from the Max. speed figure in the manual, though. That's an indicated 80,
too, of 
course. It's probably closer to 75 on the road, with stock tyres.
 
 We do need to take climate into account, though. I live in a cold, damp
climate.
VW engineers lived in a slightly warmer, drier climate, whereas David (IIRC)
lives
in a much hotter, dry climate that probably eats into the safety margins of
the
cooling system quite significantly.
 
 FWIW I bought this bus at 72K and it's now at 119K. If the 40K estimate for
the longevity of a hard-driven pancake is correct then I'm on borrowed time.
You can expect some serious word eating and evangelical preaching in the
traditional manner of the recently-converted if the engine blows in the near

future!
 
Cheers,
            W.
