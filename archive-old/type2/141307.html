Subject: Re: [T2] Type 1 Thermostats found

1) The mexican thermostats DO NOT FIT the original thermostat brackets. If 
you put a mexi thermostat into a regular bracket it will not open up enough, 
and the engine risks overheating. How many places actually tell you this, or 
even know about it for that matter.....

2) the mexican thermostats fail in the closed position, again risking 
overheating. The original thermostats almost always failed in the open 
position, resulting in a &quot;too cool&quot; condition that didn't risk blowing up 
the engine.

most parts stores sell parts, but have no clue of the advantages, 
disadvantages, and problems with the stuff they are flogging.
