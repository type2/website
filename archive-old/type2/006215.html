I know this is a bit like asking which actress is the prettiest, but I am
confused about what oil to run. I have lots of recommendations that vary
widely. I have a 74 Transporter with a new (750 miles)1.8 ltr t4. I use this
as my daily driver as well as taking the ocassional road trip. I live in a
rural area of western Kentucky which means that the speed limit on the road
in front of my house is 55mph. summer temps are in the 80's on a cool day;
commonly 90+ with high humidity. Average winter temps are around freezing,
+/- 10.

I use dino oil since the syntho stuff wasn't around when the motor was
designed, currently Castrol 10W30. I have some info that a straight 30W
would be better during the summer months, or even a 40W.

I know that there aren't any absolutes in this area, but how about some
educated opinions? I want to make this engine last and not send it to an
oily grave. (sorry--couldn't resist!)

TIA
