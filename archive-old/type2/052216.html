The later VW spec which assumes you don't have a dial gage to
mount is to tighten it tight to seat, then loosen until you can
just move the washer under the nut using say a screwdriver
to shove on its edge against the hub.  You don't want the
washer to move finger loose, but want to be able to give it a
little pry and have it slide just a bit.  Conversely you don't
want it tight enough to not move when you pry on it.  By pry
I mean more sort of twist a big flat screwdriver between the
inside of the hub and the washer.  This works for me.  Setting
em with a dial gage to spec always seems loose to me.  Some
american car type mechanics swear to tightening them down
harder than hell.  I don't buy that for sure.

Rock on the RIM should be just perceptible but don't confuse it
with movement in the tire.  If you grab the tire top and bottom
and rock it in and out you get the sensation of a LOT of play
but then notice most of it is in the sidewall of the tire moving,
not the rim rocking.  You can try to rock a bare rim mounted
for comparison.  I got 100's of thousands of miles on many
cars adjusted the way I mention, even on cheapo Chinese and
Eastern block bearings.  Should be no perceptible noise, noise
means loose or worn.  Clean everything up obviously and check the
races for scoring/galling, check the rollers in the bearings after
cleaning in kerosene, etc. etc.  Repack with good grease.  Or just
replace the bearings if in doubt as they are cheap, banging races
in and out can of course be annoying and you need to replace
the seals unless you are really good at pulling them without
damage.
