Subject: Weber 32/36 DFAV Rebuild
Message-ID: &lt;37FEA46B.961FFA6E_at_sprynet_dot_com&gt;

I've been getting some erratic hesitation/sputtering with Rita of late. 
I'm doing a major tune up over this weekend, and I'm thinking I might
tackle the job of rebuilding the Weber 32/36 carb, if I can find a place
with a rebuild kit in stock.  The PO informed me that the carb was due
for a rebuild when I got her last spring, so it's probably about time.

Question:  does anyone who has used these carbs have any advice or
points to note before I do this?  Any thoughts are welcome.

Thanks,

Jarrett
