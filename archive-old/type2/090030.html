Subject: Checking in: bought a house for Peregrine

I've been off the list for a couple of years, tending to business, but a 
couple of changes prompt me to check in and provide an update, for anyone 
who cares.

The big event: I bought a house for Peregrine (my '76).

It happened because, after some pleasant and successful round-trips to 
Tucson (from San Diego), I decided to install an oil pressure (I 
already had the gauge, sitting dead right next to my temperature gauge) 
sender. While I was at it, I thought I would install a fresh oil cooler. 
I ordered the sender from Bus Depot, but being stereotypically mostly 
Scottish I decided to try to beat Ron out of the cost of the extension 
fitting. This didn't work too well. First, I tried installing a brass 
fitting. Then I bent it, slightly, so that everything would fit, and it 
promptly broke. Got that out with an easy-out, and then tried opening up 
the space with a Dremel tool, which promptly burned out. So Ron ended up 
getting the order.

By now, though, I was tired of the whole business. I was, at the time, 
living in university housing. This included a garage bay, but with severe 
restrictions about working vehicles there (I had pulled the engine out of 
Peregrine twice, and put it back in twice, but then the management office 
decided they had had enough so I got a &quot;cease and desist&quot; notice nailed 
to my front door. I interpretted this to mean &quot;cease and desist except on 
legal holidays, when no one is around, or under cover of darkness.&quot;) I 
just got tired of working in the dark, and walked away. This meant that I 
could not do the annual registration, because it was a smog year.

Six months later, I found a ticket from the university police on 
Peregrine's windshield. Six months out of registration, the bus was in 
danger of being towed away. From a rented garage! This motivated me; I 
finished the repair (which consisted, mostly, of putting the fan shroud 
back in place and fussing with odd things to make sure I passed smog). 
I did this, then started up. Everything was going very nicely, but 
suddenly the engine died. I tried to restart. Nothing. I checked in the 
back; everything seemed fine. I had gas and spark. So I went for a walk, 
got a sinking feeling in my stomach, went back, pulled a valve cover, and 
drafted my son to crank the engine. Oh, so that was why it was so loud.

The camshaft was broken, probably at the rivets (I checked the type2 
archives to determine that this was the likely cause).

What now? I went upstairs and told my wife that we had to buy a house. I 
was motivated. Fixing the camshaft meant pulling and tearing down the 
engine. And that, given a vow I previously made myself, meant a &quot;perfect 
rebuild&quot; with balanced crankshaft and the works.

Peregrine had to go off to a rented parking space in a storage facility 
while we searched for a house, got a mortgage, and waited for the 
closing. That took two months. I found a house with a detached two-car 
garage on an alley; on April 27 I had Peregrine towed to the garage and 
slid her inside (had to push up on the garage door a half-inch or so to get 
her in).

Now, it turns out that when you buy a house with a garage for your bus, 
the house ends up being a higher priority than the bus. I guess I didn't 
think this through all the way. Anyway, I have a short block from a '78 
ready to rebuild. I've moved a ton of spare parts from rented storage to 
the garage. So as soon as I tile the kitchen floor, sheetrock the front 
garage to convert it to a home office, build a pergola and a bell tower 
to spiff up the front of the house, build a bunch of furniture, and 
figure out how to make the mortgage payments, you can bet I'll be out in 
the garage with a dial gauge and whatnot, making a perfect engine for 
Peregrine.
