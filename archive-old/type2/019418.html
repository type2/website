&gt; &gt; The shift linkage is screwed, one notch off (automatic) tries to reverse

&gt;
&gt; no most likely just pulled the linkage, there is an adjustment for it
&gt; under the floor pan just to the right of the accelerator linkage. it is a
&gt; pain in the butt to adjust but not difficult, follow the Bentley
&gt; directions

Thanks Bob, I just did this adjustment yesterday (as per Bentley) and it seems
fine now, but I had to extend the shift rod 3/4&quot;. I also have a little
vibration I didn't have before.. who knows, a road trip is called for to shake
her down I guess.
