Subject: Re: [T2] New dude on the block

I wasn't sure if it was a Delivery or
&gt; Campmobile (like I said, I'm 
&gt; clueless on Vdubs) but NADA puts low retail at
&gt; $3600 for the Delivery and 
&gt; $6175 for low retail on the Campmobile.  

It's neither.  It is a stationwagon, with the
bulkheads modified to accept who knows what seats
and some shag carpet.  I'd look very very closely
at how the front seats were mounted.  Your life
may someday depend on it.  Is there a backseat? 
Or just a platform?  

Any... well just about any nonstock modification
lowers the value of the vehicle.  I guess the
exception might be adding a porsche 6 cyl engine.
 Adding campmobile interior components may also
add value if the job is done well.  There are no
campmobile components in this bus.  My guess is
that this bus is worth far less than a stock bus.
 

No rust means a lot of different things to
different people.  To some it means that the rust
damage was covered with bondo and painted. 
Others mean no rust ever.  Find out.  It means a
world of difference in the value of the vehicle. 
Any rust damage or previous rust repairs lower
the value of the vehicle, but of course, most 30
year old vehicles have some damage.    

Now you've ridden in the bus and checked out its
karma.  That is important.  However, you admit
you don't know much about what we call busma. 
You may be perfectly happy with this bus.  It may
meet your needs perfectly.  

None of us are going to be able to tell you what
the value of the bus is.  Value is what someone
will pay for it.  Or maybe value is how much
you'd pay to get that bus pilot feeling.  I will
tell you that the market for a bus, at least here
in the temperate areas, drops DRASTICALLY in the
fall and does not return until spring.  That
means buyers market.  

The fact that the highest bid was $500 should
tell you something about what others think the
value of this bus is.  I personally wouldn't pay
$3000 for that bus.  I think you can buy more bus
for that, even in Cali.  

&gt; but someone else is making an
&gt; offer as we speak.  

Yeah, yeah, yeah... there is always someone else
making an offer on the other line.  I'd sleep on
it and feel good about the offer.  If it sells,
it sells.  There are more.

Peace and blessings,
