Subject: Re: [T2] Clicking front wheel

I have had clicking on my bus front wheels before and
it can be one of these two things, brake pads or wheel
bearings, I've had one of each so take your choice.
The pad spreader was broken letting the pad move, the
wheel bearing had gone too long without grease, packed
it and got away with it for another three years before
having to replace it. Phil
