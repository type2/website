Not to dispute that, but I think the intake and exhaust varies
slightly.  D. Elgin cams lists intake at 1.3:1 and exhaust at
1.25:1.  In my limited measurements on a variety of 2.0 rockers,
I've found them both to be somewhat less, maybe 1.24:1 and 1.28:1
and as I've noted before 2.0 rockers can vary by lot/year? quite
a bit, enough that all can not be used with hydraulic lifters without
shimming the support blocks, even on heads that have not had
the seats lowered by rebuild.

YMMV, can't see where it matters but I figured it's worth noting.

D. Elgin's www site is very interesting in general FWIW.

Another related question that has recently come to my mind, do
911 swivel adjusters exist in the M10 thread that can be used in
the T4 rocker arm?  I was glancing at an old Euro Car article that
implied 911 parts fit the 914 but failed to mention if they were for
the 1.7 or 2.0 style rocker.
