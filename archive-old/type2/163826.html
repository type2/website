Subject: New Pushrod Break-in period?

replaced a pushrod recently (yesterday) as well as my pushrod tube seals.

I readjusted the #3 and #4 cyls(the ones with the bad pushrod tube seals)
Ran the engine and the ticking was horrible!

This morning I redid the valves....they were all loose, so I
readjusted them again.
Got that beautiful loud sewing machine noise issuing forth from my
intakes and breathed a sigh of relief.

Took the bus for a short drive and the ticking has returned albeit to
a much lesser degree.

Is it normal to re adjust the valves a few times after doing this sort
of work or is it just my inexperience with making valve adjustments
and T4 engines in general?

75 T4 2.0L/ 79 EFI (franken-engine)
AFAIK stock valvetrain.
