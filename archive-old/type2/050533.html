Subject: Re: [T2] Timing help with '71 Westy

Your bus originally came with a dual-vacuum distributor designed to be set
at 5 degrees ATDC, and the pulley notch (if it is the original pulley)
reflects 5 ATDC.  To the right of the notch and on the opposit (rear) side
of the pulley) is an oval indentation with the TDC mark.

The 009 distributor is designed for a static timing of 7.5 degrees BTDC,
which means that neither of the existing marks is correct.

Measure from the existing notch along the curve of the pulley to the point
opposite the TDC mark.  multiply this figure buy 2.5 and measure clockwise
from the existing 5 ATDC notch.  this will be the 7.5BTDC mark.  Make a
mark here on the pulley with a file.

This will be your static timing mark.

&gt; I need some help with my '71Westy.  I recently tuned it up, adjusted the point dwell to 48 degrees, and adjusted the carburetor.  I am confused about how to set the timing.  It is a 1600cc engine, with a single carb, and a B5 engine number.  It also has a -009 disty on it.  There is a single notch on the pulley.  The engine was recently rebuilt, and the timing was set to the right of the notch, which implies to me that it was set to 5 deg. BTDC.  From what I read in Muir and Bentley, it should be set to 5 deg. ATDC--i.e., to the left of the notch in the pulley.  I currently have it set at the notch, since Muir implies that the notch might actually be at 5 ATDC, but it seems to run a little worse, hesitating from a stop.
&gt; 
&gt; Can you help me out here?  Thanks.  Please respond off-line, as I am in digest mode.
