Subject: Re: [T2] fire talk

&gt;On classic or unique vehicles, the point is generally to protect yourself,
&gt;monetarily, in the event that you hit someone else.  This is why US law
&gt;requires a certian minimum of Liability insurance coverage.

Well not in TN until just recently... &lt;scary...&gt;

&gt;There also are wide variety of insurances to cover your own vehicle and
&gt;medical bills.  Most are woefully inadequate with regards to older cars,
&gt;though....and it's not just a matter of paying more, either.  The
&gt;insurance companies will be happy to take your money...but the policies
&gt;they have still don't generally work out to help replace unique vehicles.

I've got too much sweat equity in my Westy. No check for normally values 
will ever cover that.
