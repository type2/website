Subject: Re: tin screws

I found one of the easiest ways to get the screws out the next time is to
replace them with socket head cap screws (allen screws).  I just bought a bunch
at Ace hardware, installed them when I replaced my long block and tossed all the
standard screws into my spare parts can.  It even looks kinda nice with all the
shiny cap screws in there.
