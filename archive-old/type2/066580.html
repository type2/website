Hi all,
   I just managed to snag one of those center stools at the local VW
shop.  Got it from a guy who is definately on the Deadhead end of the
 conciousness spectrum.  Dreads and all that.  Casual.  However, in this
case he really knows his busses.  He finds and ravages all those junkyards
everybody hears about but never finds.. Anyway, he knew what he had and
he wasn't about to part with that seat for less than $15. (He started at 25)
I felt like it was Christmas!  Sometimes you just gotta have it. :))
Nice to know I can turn the list for moral support. Everybody else keeps
asking me when I'm gonna get a 'real' car.  HA!  What's so sick about having
a few spare busses in the yard?  When everybody has spent thier last penny
at the FLARS, I will be the last one standing dammit. I've seen those
'real' cars, and frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.  Oh PLEASE...A $1500
rebate?..Just haveta spend $19000?!?  HEE HEE HA HA HA  Lemmethink.
I may be crazy but I'm not stupid. (no comment from personal friends please)
But I forget myself.  It must be the 'Smoke-Drink-Curse' syndrome.

  Rave on,  Chris

   '71, '69 Westys and assorted Busbones.
