Hi folks,

Well this is only indirectly about Type 2s so I saved it till Friday.

The Web home page of the VW Type 2 Owners Club has moved from:
	members.aol_dot_com/vwt2oc
to:
	www.soft_dot_net_dot_uk/vwt2oc

There's a link left behind so please don't feel there is a need to update your
web page links straight away.

The basic content of the page is the same although it now uses frames. This
move from a site with 2Mb to one with 50Mb gives us room to grow.

Any reports of bits where I screwed up would be welcome, also if anyone has a
browser that doesn't support frames comments on accessing the page would be
welcome.

Many thanks and happy motoring
Bob
