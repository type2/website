Subject: Re: [T2] !_at_!_at_#% Key won't come out!

ben says:
&gt;&gt;Is there a quick way to pop the lock without removing the steering wheel, etc
bob says:
&gt;well if the key went in it should come out,  sounds like a tumble is sticking

i like access bob's advice. i put the wrong key in my 68 last week, turned
it on and i had the same !_at_!_at_#%ing thing happen. disconnected the power at
the coil, and went to work. i undid the four phillips screws plus two bolts
off the support [fig 9-13 bentley] and bent the support down a few inches.
got a paper clip and poked in the proper hole, upper right side. a small
mirror was helpful to see while sitting in the driver's seat. i pulled the
key and out came the lock. prolly all unnecessary: the key came out of the
lock with force, but i was only more willing to do it out of the housing,
in case the key broke off. with key in it is useful to pull lock.  try oil
first. hth, of course this is for early bay   - steve
