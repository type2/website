Subject: Chokes &lt;cough, cough&gt;

When I got my bus, there was a pin or something missing from my automatic
clutch (the carb is a 30pict1) so I disabled it like Muir says.  However,
as the weather gets colder &lt;sniff&gt;, I am having to give it extra gas longer
nad longer before it will idle without stalling which kinda defeats the
purpose of disabling the choke.

I was in my local auto-parts store today and saw a manual choke conversion
kit (Basically a push-pull lever and a cable).  Hmmm...

Do most of you folks still use the auto-choke or have it disabled?  Has
anyone put in a manual choke?
