Find yourself one of those old Coleman catalytic heaters. They adjust from 
3500 -5000 btu. Best thing is that when their running you can still lay a 
piece of paper on top of them. I've used it in the westy (vent window 
cracked) and even in the Astro van. My parents used them in their tent trlr 
with no harm to any of us. The best thing is can you say toasty warm! Second 
best thing, can sometimes find them cheap at swap meets.
