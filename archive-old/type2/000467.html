Hey Ken, why did you change the filter. It surely kept all unwanted messages
off the list :-)

Question:

Can anybody tell me if the filler on a '69 is attached to the tank via
rubber hoses? This is the filler that is still forward of the position it
was put in later and looks ike it goes straight into the tank. Also it is of
a different design, fairly wide and the gas cap looks very antiquated (it's
a locking cap but it takes me for ages to get it on and off because I still
have not figured out the correct turn and twist motion of key and cap).
