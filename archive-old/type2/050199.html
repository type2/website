Subject: Re: [T2] Costa Rican VW Scene

[...]

Did you happen to run into A. J. Horning, proprietor of the Air-cooled VW
Junkyard [formerly of Richfield, Ohio]?  He threatened for several years to
relocate the 'Yard to Costa Rica, and even made some trips there to scope
out the situation and possibilities.

&gt;&gt;  I just returned from a very nice trip to Costa Rica. I stayed wit some
people I know down there so I didnt do alot of touristy stuff.  We did alot
of driving and I saw plenty of nice VW's. I also saw many that were barely
on the road. Most people down there dont have much money so most of the
beetles and buses were just
unrestored daily drivers.  &lt;&lt;
