Subject: Re: Jalousie(?) window restoration

&gt;I've been noticing on my screens on the jalousie windows that there
is quite a gap between the screen and the frame -- big enough for a 
&gt;good sized moth to crawl through, which is how I first noticed it. 
&gt;More than enough for misquito to get in. Is there supposed to be a 
&gt;rubber seal there or something? I was thinking of trying to squirt 
&gt;silicone caulk or something in there. 

There is not any seal for that.  The gap is most likely due to your screen
frame(s) being bowed outward.  Simply remove them and GENTLY coax them into
being flat again (use a table or driveway to check them).  If you fill the
gap with caulk, you can't easily remove them anymore.  

Why remove them you ask?  So that when you're driving mit Jalousie-Fenstern
versehen opened the screens won't whistle!  I store mine underneath the
rear-hatch cushion so I've always got them when I need them.
