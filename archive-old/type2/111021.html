&gt; I could easily see the clutch cable snapping due to current being passed

Steel has lower conductivity (about 1/6 that of copper or 1/3 that of
aluminum), but it can conduct as long as the conductor
is big enough.  Your ground strap connects to the body/frame, which is
made of steel and conducts the current back to the battery just fine.

OTOH, the clutch cable has a relatively small cross-sectional area, so I
was surprised when mine survived.  Either there was a path to ground that
I overlooked, or the fact that my bus starts easily managed to minimize
the heating of the clutch cable.
