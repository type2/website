Subject: RE: Accordian Heater Tube

Originally there would have been an asbestos 'collar' wrapped round the
inside of the tube, about 1&quot; wide and 1/8&quot; thick.  Then inside that, next to
the metal tube, is a thin metal sleeve.  I bought new tubes a couple of
years ago and the asbestos is now some sort of high temp plastic (I assume
it's high temp, might have melted all over for all I know).  The piece of
asbestos you found in there will be the remains of one of the collars, they
are quite crumbly.  You could have a go at making something to pad out the
tube at the join.  AFAIK it is not possible to buy the gaskets on their own.
It does seem a waste to throw away the whole tube, there is probably nothing
else wrong with it.
