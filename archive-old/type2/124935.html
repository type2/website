Subject: Re: [T2] It just died

What do you have?
I have a '77 FI bus that will die straight away if a hose comes loose.
I don't know what sort of engine you have in your bus.
Is it still cranking?
Are you getting spark?
We will all assume you have petrol...

 I was humming along at 70, as usual, and the bus just died.
