Subject: RE: [T2] R.I.P. 'Rocky Mountain' Motorworks

&gt;The only real question remaining is the show they had every year 
&gt;on the Saturday before the Bandimere show here in Denver in early 
&gt;August.  It was a campout and attended by many, some from this 
&gt;list I suspect.  Anyone picking up the ball on having this campout 
&gt;this year?  I was thinking about trying to organize something maybe 
&gt;at Red Rocks Park, just up the road from the Bug-In show.  Thoughts??

Jim, you might want to check with the Colorado VW Bus Club at
http://www.coloradovwbusclub_dot_com/  For the past several years they've
organized and administered the campout at the RMMW show.  They've been a
pretty active camping group so it's likely that they're already planning a
contingency.
