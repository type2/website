Subject: [T2] cabinet blueprints???

Hi,

I would like to assemble a little cabinet behind the drivers or passengers 
seat, and was wondering if anyone had any blueprints for it? I found someone 
who had some old manual that listed blueprints for stuff you could build for 
your bus, but of course the link has gone 404!

Anyone have one of these uploaded someplace already? or a desihn you would 
like to pass on to me, would be super duper! Gotta start getting ready for a 
month long tour around the mid to west and id like to start working on the 
interior now that I finally got the mechanicals taken care of, for the time 
being anyway.. hehe
