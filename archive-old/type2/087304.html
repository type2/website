&gt;&gt;I heard that a bug generator is shorter  (also it's stamped 30
amps) and can cause problems. I'm thinking that the PO put a bug engine in
the bus....&lt;&lt;

If it is a bug engine, then the generator will be the right one for the motor and cause no problems. To find out what your engine is from look at the code stamped on the base of the generator stand. Post that number to the list and I am SURE someone can tell you definitively if it is a beetle engine.
