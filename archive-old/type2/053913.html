&gt;Today I managed to get up enough gumption to go out and tackle the flywheel

&gt;while and seeing the subject talked about, I checked the pilot bearing. Well,
&gt;there is little to nothing left of it. What I pulled out of there was trash.
&gt;I mean there was nothing but bits of metal. One piece **kinda** looked like
&gt;it might have been a bearing. Now the problem is how to get the rest of it
&gt;out so that I can put the new one in (that I picked up just in case - patting
&gt;myself on the back for that one). Any helpful hints? I hope so, because I'm
&gt;not touching this one until I hear something... and I'm hoping to get my
&gt;Westy on the road soon, 'cause some people are starting to believe that I
&gt;don't really have one (not directed at Snoopy in **any** way)

Great subject for research in the archives, as many methods have been 
posted here in the past, most several times.  The most popular seem to be 
renting a pilot bearing puller, the grease-packing method, and breaking 
apart/hacksawing.  Since the bearing is already broken apart, you might 
consider the third method which I almost always use.  Buy a new sharp 
fine-tooth hacksaw blade, clamp it in a vice grips and carefully cut 
through the pilot bearing from inside to out.  When you are nearly through 
it will weaken enough to be pryed out with a screwdriver.  I've done this 
several times and to me it is the least frustrating method, although I am 
going to try the grease method next time since it just sounds too cool.
