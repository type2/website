Since the subject of canvas has come up...has anyone tried to cut/sew their 
own replacement canvas? My '77 needs new canvas, and I've been thinking about 
trying to make my own. I've found a local fabric store that will order the 
material, but my wife has just a plain 'ol Singer sewing machine that she 
says I will most likely burn up trying to sew it all together. The current 
canvas (which I believe to be original) isn't really that heavy of a 
material. If you look at it, it's really only 4 panels sewn together. The 
hardest part I see would be the front panel with the screen and the zippered 
flap. Just curious!  Hey, come to think of it, if I'm successful I may have a 
new business. I always heard Dawn had more than she could handle.      Jeff S.
