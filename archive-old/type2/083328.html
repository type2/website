&gt; what is pertronix?

Pertronix is an aftermarket replacement part for you points and condensor on 
you distributor.  It has a 4-sided lobe with magnets in it that slips onto the 
shaft of your distributor and a pick-up unit that attaches where your points 
are.  As the dizzy spins, the 4 magnets in it (one associated with each of the 
4 lobes on your dizzy's shaft) send a signal to the pick-up unit, telling your 
coil when to send &quot;The Big Spark&quot; to your spark plugs.

I was a firm believer in Pertronix ($60-70) since it sends a more uniform, 
contrallable signal vs. the stock points/condensor unit.  Until the one I had 
in my 73 Westy went bad and I spent TWO Winters in Colorado wondering why my 
bus would start then die immediately.  Now, I'm not so sure.  When they work, 
they work great, but when they fail you're screwed (and with very odd symptoms).

So, to make a long story short (too late!) if you pull off your distributor cap 
and see a 4-lobed redish or black thing that surrounds the metal shaft 
underneath the rotor you've got a Pertronix.  If you see a metal-armed thing 
with a spring-metal spring on one end of it with a tiny rectangular bit that 
pushes against the metal lobes of your dizzy as it turns round and round, 
you've got points.
