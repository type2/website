Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for Alternator Conversion Kit for 71 Westy

I _think_ that the &quot;75A&quot; alternator is a rewound unit, made to replace the
stock ~50A unit.  I don't really see why you would need the 75A unit
unless you're running lots of off-road lights.  Better to save the bucks
and keep it stock!

&gt; &gt; You're better off getting the tin and stand used rather than buying the
&gt; &gt; &quot;kit&quot;.  Fit will be better and the tin is much thicker.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The only other thing in the kit will be a set of wiring instructions,
&gt; &gt; which you can get from the group when you need them.
&gt;
&gt; is there any difference between the 38 amp alternator and the 75 amp
&gt; alternator, size wise?
&gt;
&gt; i.e. if I'm already running a 38 amp alternator, can I just pop a 75 amp
&gt; one on there, or, do I have to
&gt; go and buy a new alternator stand, etc.?
