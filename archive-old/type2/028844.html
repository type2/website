&gt; I went to my FLAPS and I was flabbergasted when they told me,
&gt; &quot;We don't carry a battery for a 76 Transporter, nor do I even have a
&gt; listing for it.&quot;


Then ask him to look up &quot;type 2&quot;, then try &quot;station wagon,&quot; &quot;bus,&quot; and
&quot;van,&quot; and any other iteration you can think of. It's probably listed in
some manner.  Before I started the Bus Depot, and I still bought parts at
FLAPS, I learned to try every possible name for a bus when told that a part
was not carried.  The guy behind the counter probably does not know enough
to realize that the &quot;type 2&quot; listing in his book is analagous to the
&quot;transporter&quot; application you asked about.
