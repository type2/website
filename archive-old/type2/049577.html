Subject: [T2] Axle Beam Rot

Good Morning All!
     A couple of weeks ago when I posted the details of my &quot;new&quot; '77 Westy 
and mentioned the axle beam rot, several folks asked what it was and how to 
tell if theirs had it. I posted a picture of the front beam on my page, so if 
want to see what it looks like, follow the link. I need to resize the 
pictures, but have not had the time, I apologize for the lengthy time it 
takes to load.  Jeff S. &lt;A
