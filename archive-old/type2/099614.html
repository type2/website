Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder rebuild questions (long)

Pull that engine and then make a big show of washing and waxing the rolling 
chassis at the curb. If the engine is out but the rest fot eh vehicle is 
complete - maybe nobody would notice.

Your other option is to pull the engine after the vehicle is stored at one 
of those temp storage places. I rented one for a garage for about a  year 
'94/'95 when I as in the Navy to install the Type IV in my Beetle. They did 
not care as long as I was clean and not trashing the place. My &quot;garage&quot; was 
a as clean when I left as when I rented it.

$65 a month.
