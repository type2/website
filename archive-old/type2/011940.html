Subject: quits running after driving awhile. Thermal check
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

A easy check on elect. components/parts for thermal
problems is to use a heat gun (carefully) or a hair dryer
(probably better/safer). You can quickly bring a individual
component up to temperature in the comfort of your own
drive way. This isnt foolproof but it does work most of the
time if it is a thermal problem with a &quot;single&quot; component.
