Karl is having some problems posting, so he forwarded the attached to me
and I am sending it to the list.

A caveat on posting to the list is that, to control spam, the right to
post is limited to subscribers (with some exceptions).  The way we do this
is to match the address you are posting from to the address you subscribed
from.  If they don't match... you can't post.  *Normally* this is not a
problem.  This past weekend saw _at_home_dot_com joined &quot;the dotcom dead pool&quot;
and a lot of people got switched to new ISPs, in some cases transparently.
If you are having trouble posting, please write to the administrators of
the type2 list.  THIS IS NOT ME!!!  I managed to find s/o/m/e/
s/u/c/k/e/r/s/... err... a group of volunteers :-) to replace me.  Go to
the www.type2_dot_com web page and click on type2 to discover who your current
hosts are... please report any problems to them.

Subject: Tire class action suit

There is a problem [supposedly] with tire separation on Cooper tires. A lot
of
people use them. Here is the website:

http://www.coopertirelitigation_dot_com/coopertire/

What is really surprising is the amount of tires made by Cooper but using
other
names. Winston and Yokohama!!  are on the list.
Here is the list of names of Cooper-made tires included in the suit:

This is why I only buy Michelin tires.....
