&gt; This is the oil pressure relief valve location on a 914.
&gt; Remove the plug with an allen wrench, and you will find
&gt; a spring and piston. If you have a 914 engine case,
&gt; there will be a vertical dipstick at the breather box,
&gt; the casting for the bus oil filler tube will be casted
&gt; but not opened, as well as the location for a mechanical
&gt; fuel pump ( carb engine ). The engine number will be either
&gt; by the breather box or on the case seam front.
&gt; Lets start with your engine case #- What is it ?

&gt; &gt;I didn't get the correct answer to my original post, but I've got
additional
&gt; &gt;information.  The &quot;hole&quot; in my crankcase at #1 cylinder between the
pushrod
&gt; &gt;tube holes is pluged from the inside with a thin aluminum hollow plug.  I
&gt; &gt;looked at other type 4 cases at a local repair shop and it appears that
&gt; &gt;there's supposed to be a 12 point plug there.  It's shown on page 5-55 of
&gt; &gt;Bentley but no reference number is given, nor is there an explanation of
its
&gt; &gt;function.  Does anyone know what this is?
