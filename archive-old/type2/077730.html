Subject: Re: [T2] oil additive advice

Doktor Tim sends:

&gt; Direct experience with Split fire plugs. Lotus turbo comes in running poor.
&gt; Pull plugs= split fires with less than 1000 miles on them had cracked
&gt; insulators. Stock plugs fixed all problems.

The only engine I ever saw Splitfires work well in was a 200-horse Johnson
V6 outboard on my night shift supervisor's bass boat. He was using Champion
standard spark plugs because &quot;the manual&quot; said to use Champions, and the
manual didn't say &quot;Champion Platinum spark plugs.&quot; Anyone want to wager that
Johnson's CDI system needs platinum plugs to work right?
