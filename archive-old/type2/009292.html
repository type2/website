There are 2 types of vacuum:

Ported = This is vacuum that doesn't exist at idle. It appears when you open 
the throttle. It is used for the vacuum advance and evap purge valve.

Manifold = This is vacuum at idle. It is used for vacuum retards, decel 
valves, and pressure regulators.

Ported vacuum comes from the nipple on the front of the throttle housing. It 
is teed to the vacuum advance on the distributor and the EEC purge valve on 
the back of the air cleaner.

Manifold vacuum comes from the nipple on the right side of the plenum 
between #1 and #2 intake runners. It is teed to the decel valve and the 
pressure regulator.

There is a nipple on the right end of the charcoal cannister. This is 
connected to the tee that joins the 2 tank vent lines together by the heater 
blower. Do NOT connect any other vacuum lines to this nipple.
