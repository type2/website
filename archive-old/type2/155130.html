Subject: solid state isolators

In my opinion and experience, mechanical contactor that is fired by the X 
circuit or ignition circuit is all that is needed.

It has to be a normally open type contactor. Tractor trailer shops have them or 
you can ask at your local Espar heater shop.

With this system, you will get no voltage drop from a transistor junction and 
maximum current to charge your battery.

I have to just keep my contacts clean and the deep cycle battery works fine for 
me on my modern Espar Gas Heater.

Cheers,

Alan
