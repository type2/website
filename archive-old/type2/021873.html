Dan:
Come on, I appreciate your humor, but you should probably ratchet it down a
notch.
Everthing here makes sense except the word &quot;timing&quot; before the word belt. It
could have been added by a car lot salesman that didn't know any better.
At least the dealer represented the vehicle as having engine problems and that's
better than many do!
Jim Mowreaders advice still applies, still need to replace the heads, maybe the
pistons/cylinders too. Still way easier than fixing rust!
Keep us posted regarding what you find.

&gt; Damn I was wondering why my engine would not run thought I was missing a part
&gt;  I guess I figured it out. Had to be the timing belt that no one has in
&gt; stock. Had to be a pretty crappy dealership if they told you it broke a
&gt; timing belt. Figuring aircooleds dont have timing belts. They must have seen
&gt; a sucker coming.
