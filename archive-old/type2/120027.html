Subject: RE: [T2] Stub axle

I have stripped 2 pair of drums on my '69 baja in the woods or on trails.  Each time
I was amazed to see that the axle splines appear to be perfect.  I did have to knock the remaining metal from the drums out of the splines to get the new set of drums on...Amazingly hard material those axles are....

Sorry to say, but if the brake drum splines actually stripped, I'd have
trouble believing that the stub axle splines could be in decent shape. You
can inspect them of course, look for any missing chunks or bent, worn,
asymetrical splines. Other than splines, i'd think the stub axle is pretty
bullet proof. Obviously be prepared to replace the bearings. I had to beat
my stub axle pretty firmly with a plastic mallet to get it out and back in
the bearing housing; tight fit on the inner bearing race. I think that's
normal.

I have a '70 Bus that has, I believe, developed an issue within the stub
axle assembly. I had the splines on the brake drum fail a couple months ago
and I think this preciptated this other failure (presumably one or both
bearings). What I'm looking for is help or hints in doing this job.
