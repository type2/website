Hi Volks,

I have recently remodelled my Bus website and included new information on
combating rust and the like. However it turned out that some people were
unable to see the 'buttons' and hence could not navigate to the desired
pages.

This was caused by having 'state of the art' buttons driven by Java script.
Older browsers will not show them. I have reverted back to good old
hyperlinks so you should be able to navigate through the pages now. You will
need a browser that supports frames. I will not go back to a frameless
set-up.

Note: This is a Friday message although it may still be Thursday at your end
of the ocean. However in Australia it's already well into Friday.
