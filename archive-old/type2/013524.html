Subject: Gas in oil
Message-ID: &lt;20010618.225805.-3999685.0.vw1977_at_juno_dot_com&gt;
X-Juno-Line-Breaks: 2-3

I have a 78 Westy, (fuel injected), and noticed the valves sounded loud.
I checked the oil and it was over full by about a half quart. I smelled
the oil and have a strong gasoline smell. How could gas get in the oil?
Any help would be appreciated.
Mike
