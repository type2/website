Subject: [T2] Re: How long can a westy run?

One of the little-known facts that experienced bus owners have learned
is that there are significant mechanical and operational differences
between the Westy and non-Westy busses.  Consider the following
examples:

The question &quot;how long can a westy run?&quot; illustrates this clearly.  This
is not the same question as &quot;how long can a deluxe run?&quot; or &quot;how long
can a kombi run?&quot; etc.  A Westy, having different engine, transaxle,
suspension, brakes, and electrical system, is simply different from a
non-Westy.

Similarly -- as attested to by the large number of queries of this
nature -- posts with headings like &quot;Westy parts needed&quot; that are asking
for wheel cylinders and engine tin are entirely appropriate, as
Westfalia campmobiles used different running gear from other models.

Those interested in Westfalia campmobiles have occasionally been
frustrated when reading a &quot;Westy&quot; post, mistakenly expecting that it
would refer to the camping equipment or the usage thereof.  They should
pay heed to this information in the future.

Look for additional articles on related subjects at my website:

- beetle cabrio and sedan: same engine?  Not so!
