Subject: Barrel shims

Every thing was going really well on what I call my engine
mini overhaul. Engine: type IV-2000cc in a 77 bus

So today I was looking over every thing today I noticed a shim
on the bottom of the cylinder that went between the cylinder
and case. For some reason this part I never noticed and now
I am sitting here banging my head on the desk(just kidding).
O well next time I wont make the same mistake. Live and learn!

I tried comparing the shim to my feeler gauge but its
to hard to tell. Could I install the cylinder and check
the deck height(it has to be 0.040 or more right?).
My cylinder has a dished out center so would I measure
across the cylinder top and the outer portion of the piston.
So then I would order the appropriate shim to bring it to specs
right? If I am wrong please let me know, this is all very new to me.

I checked busdepot for some barrel shims.  After searching for
spacers I found &quot;BRL SPACER&quot; but no specs such as the size of
the shim.
RON if your read this let me know if you stock these or not
please :)

Any one thats got some words of wisdom send it my way please!
Thanks
Alex,
