Subject: RE: [T2] Cheap/Easy HP boosters? 

&lt;&lt; Pigs don't fly, and buses are underpowered. &gt;&gt;


True true, but to compare addages, instead of looking at it as &quot;I am
what I am, and that's all that I am.&quot; I prefer to look at it as &quot;Be all
that you can be!&quot; and of course &quot;Theirs always room for improvement.&quot;

Heck, if VW believed good was good enough, we'd never have had the
Deisel Rabbit. Oh, wait, bad example. Lol  heh heh

Cheers
Chris
