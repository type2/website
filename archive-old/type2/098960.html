Subject: Re: [T2] Top speed

Hi David,

LOL... Cresting a hill at 75???  That I have trouble imagining.

I believe that another contributing factor to engine longevity is 
modern fuels. With 99% of the vehicles on the road being fuel injected 
and water-cooled, fuel manufacturers are moving to additives to help 
them run cleaner. My belief (unfrtunately not supported due to 
manufacturers &quot;unavailable&quot; data) is that these fuels burn hotter than 
the fuels of the 70's did.

Happy trails,

&gt; Increasing engine size also requires an increase in the brake system--
&gt;&gt; the factory always did so--but few owner/improvers do.....it's still
&gt;&gt; on my &quot;to do&quot; list.  This is one of the reasons I keep my speed down,
&gt;&gt; in the bus.
&gt;
&gt; Well said.  Busses have enough trouble stopping quickly from 60mph.  
&gt; Think about cresting a hill at 75mph in your bus and seeing traffic 
&gt; stopped in the road ahead... a scary thought, especially in a Westy 
&gt; loaded with people and camping equipment.
