Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hi   I hope somebody shed some light on my brake problem.
Recently I've replaced the discs, pads, calipers. After I'd replaced the
pads(for the second time, 1st set contaminated with brake fluid), the brake
lights have decided to fail. The bulbs, fuses are okay and I've replaced the
switch on the master cylinder, but to no avail. 
Any help appreciated
Mark
