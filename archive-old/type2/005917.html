I have an old craftsman tool box, that weighs 300 pounds, by its self
alone...I fabbed some aluminum straps to keep it where it bbelongs, I used
the angle iron method to make tracks for it to trolly on, to the edge of the
door, it normally rest behind the drivers seat..

I really bet you guys would like to know what brakes are on the puppy..I'm
not inclined to say yet, as I may be selling a kit soon if they go a few
more thousand with no problems.. All I have to say is that they are not
stock, atleast for a BUS..It took a Lathe, Mill, Belt sander, and several
hours to make them get close to working...They are awesome..I have a few non
vw, (still aircooled) parts cars around here..

&gt; &gt;Hey sean, The thing I like most about that powerstroke is the 2nd gear
take
&gt; &gt;off's just like first gear, even with 1,000 pounds of goodies in the
cargo
&gt; &gt;area...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; OK, Jake, pleasepleaseplease tell us about your brake upgrades to haul all
&gt; that mass back down from what sounds like an easy 80 mph cruising speed.
&gt; How do you affix the tool boxes so they don't bang around in the corners.
&gt; I've always thought spot welding 3/4&quot; angle irons to the floor would be
the
&gt; way to go for a mobile shop vehicle. Perhaps short sections of pipe to set
&gt; the Hazet Assistant tool trolly wheels in so they wouldn't fly forward
when
&gt; a deer/dog/kid appears in a moment of inattention???
