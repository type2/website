Subject: Re: ADMIN Re: [T2] Rare Type 3 Repair Manual Going Cheap on
  Ebay

Sorry already...the members here sure know the rules...four have already
chastised me.
I'm a newby and didn't know or read the rules thoroughly enough...It'll
never happen again...promise!
Whoh...I'm going to go do something more safe now...like enter a biker bar
in a suit and tie.

I am curious though, every time I have placed a question on this list I get
emails from people wanting to sell me their products that will solve my
problem. THAT'S GOOD...I'M NOT COMPLAINING. In fact the way that I found out
about this book was through a helpful listy on this list who turned me onto
the book. I then went looking for the book...found two and decided to make
one of them available to someone else. When I was looking for it, if someone
had one for sale on Ebay or any other list or site...I would have welcomed
them letting me know about it. I'm now wondering how they would have done
that. Someone mentioned The Samba...but I find that site a nightmere to get
around in. Anyhow...I wasn't meaning to step on toes...I just thought
someone else might be looking for the book like I was.

Thank you,

&gt; From the charter:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;--Do not try to promote your eBay auctions or other auctions on the
list.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Pretty simple, no?  Not to mention that this is the type2 list, not the
type3 list.
&gt;
&gt; Folks, there are only a few rules here.  Please adhere to them.  If you
don't know what the rules are, go back and re-read the charter at
http://www.type2_dot_com/type2charter.html.
&gt;
&gt; Duane, sorry but we are not here to help you make money.
