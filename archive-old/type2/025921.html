&gt; There is a limit to how slick you want primer so the next coat will bite or
&gt; stick. Something along the lines of 250 grit or so. I'll let the paint
&gt; experts comment here. Or you could check with your local friendly paint
&gt; store fellow for information about this. Coarse enough for the paint to
&gt; bite, slick enough that the scratches are properly filled by that next coat
&gt; of paint or primer.

Depends on the system. I use all Sikkens, so I got the tech data sheets for
their stuff and looked...

Autosurfacer 940HS: wet sand--presand with 400 grit wet, final sand with 500
to 600 grit wet. Dry sand--presand with 220 to 240, move in stages to final
sanding with 360 to 400 grit dry.

Colorbuild Undercoat System: wet sand--presand with 500 grit wet, final sand
with 600 to 800 grit wet. Dry sand--presand with 280 grit dry, final sand
with 400 to 500 grit dry.

Priming Filler 680: wet sand--presand if necessary with 500 grit wet, moving
in stages to final sanding with 600 to 800 grit wet. Dry sand--presand with
320 grit dry, moving in stages to final sanding with 400 to 500 grit dry.

Primer Surfacer EP: 400 to 500 grit dry or 500 to 600 grit wet. If applying
a polyester product (glazing putty), sand with 150 to 180 grit dry.

Autowave Filler 790: wet sand--presand with 500 grit dry, move in stages to
600 to 800 grit wet, then allow 30 minutes minimum drying time before
topcoating--this is a water-based primer. Dry sand--presand with 280 grit
dry, move in stages to 400 to 500 grit dry.

Autosurfacer Non-Sanding: 400 to 500 grit dry or 600 to 800 grit wet. Yes, I
wondered about the name of this product too.

Washprimer EM: wet sand--presand with 400 grit wet, final sand with 500 to
600 grit wet. Dry sand--presand with 240 grit dry, final sand with 360 to
400 grit dry.

Washprimer CR: do not sand this product.

Hmmm...nothing as coarse as 250 grit. The instruction about asking the paint
store people is the best.
