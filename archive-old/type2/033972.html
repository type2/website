Subject: Re: Anyone have an accelerator cable for a '77 automatic bus?

Marcus:

What you need is a 211-723-555 accelerator cable for automatics. We normally
have them for $17.95. We are out right now, but should have more by the
begining of the year.

Thank You!

&quot;Customer service is not a department,
it's an attitude&quot;

&gt; My accelerator cable snaped, and my mechanic wants to order a new one from
&gt; VW becuase he says he can't find the right one anywhere else.  He says it
&gt; might be $30-40 from them.  From what he tells me, the ones for a manual
&gt; transmission are about $5, and very plentiful, but these others are hard
to
&gt; find.
