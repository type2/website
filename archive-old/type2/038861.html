I am offerring these harnesses at 10% off for type 2 mailing list members.
If anyone wants one, order it and put &quot;type 2 mailing list member&quot; in the
special instructions field, and I'll take care of you.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; just thought I'd pass along a good experience with Wiring Works.  I
searched
&gt; high and low for a wiring harness for my '71 and was finally steered
towards
&gt; Wiring Works.  The harness is beautiful and arrived very quickly.  Thanks
to
&gt; everyone for offering to cut out their old ones, but no longer needed.
&gt;     Also (since its Friday), is anyone familiar with any dealerships that
&gt; deal with old vw's in the Pheonix area?  I'm headed down there in a couple
&gt; of weeks and would like to drag along my Thing to sell, but don't want to
&gt; worry about finding a buyer in only 2 days.  Please pmail if you know of
&gt; anyplace.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Paul
