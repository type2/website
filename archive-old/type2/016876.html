&gt; I was a little nervous since I had never met them and didn't really know
&gt; what to expect.  But from the moment they pulled into the driveway and came
&gt; inside, I knew I had made a good decision.   I had made a lifetime friend.

    This what the Bus Lists are all about...

    I met Charlie Ford and Gus this way , this past weekend I met Micheal Heron
this way as well...

    I'll grieve for Josh just as I grieved for Gus last summer.  They helped
make the world a better place each in their own way.
