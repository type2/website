Subject: heat?

   I am considoring buying a VW bus and was wanting to know
the story behind the heating problems in the bus's.

If some one could also fill me in alittle on how exactly the heat
is exchanged from the engine to the interior cab.

The year bus I am looking at is a 66 westy.

Thanks
Alex,
