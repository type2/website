Subject: re VWOA crusade re their trademarks.

I went into my local VW dealer today for something, and while there, I
unloaded on them re the VWOA situation vis a vis legal action against ACVW
vendors. I let them hear it loud and clear, but their attitude was, oh well,
we have to protect our trademarks, what can you do? I mentioned the
alienation of the air cooled crowd, his reaction was, in a nutshell,  Oh
well, we don't seem to get too many of those anyway. Kind of unsatisfying,
but at least I tried. Maybe if everyone else does the same thing....    Tom

btw- They've always treated me like gold at that dealership
