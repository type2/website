&gt;Thanks, Richard. I've been searching for the overhaul kit all morning, but 
&gt;it's pretty elusive. When I looked through the archives I found talk about a 
&gt;few vendors, but they don't carry said kit any more. I'll probably head down 
&gt;to the flaps to see if I can piece together some of the parts that I can't 
&gt;reuse from whatever they have in the bins. Or see if I can order the kit.

I special ordered mine from Donsco which is local to me:

To find an IMC dealer near you, call the phone at imcparts_dot_com.

&gt;Also, between the dist. drive gear and the case I found only  one shim. 
&gt;Should there be two? I think I read in one of Hoover's sermons that two are 
&gt;the norm.

It depends on how much endfloat you need to achieve. To aim for 0.30-0.35mm of endfloat you'll need to mic your shims.
