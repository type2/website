Subject: Will a '72 tranny go into a late '74 Bus?

I was reading on Ratwell's site about a tranny swap. I 
have a late '74 Bus. 215mm flywheel. The site says that I 
can install a '72 tranny into my late '74 Bus, but I would 
need to replace the flywheel with the 210mm.

Is the flywheel the only thing that would need to match 
the '72 tranny? Or will I need to replace other parts as 
well? Also, if I do install this, when replacing the 
flywheel, does it need any adjustment? Or is it just 
tightened on?

Thanks for any info or help.
