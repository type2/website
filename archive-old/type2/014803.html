Subject: Gas heater repairman in the NW

		Hey all, 
		I know that in the past month there has been talk of the
lack of gas heater repair people. Well I found one in Seattle Wa. He is a
Wet Westies member and he came to the last campout. Just in one weekend he
repaired several heaters for other campers that showed up. He also looked at
a heater I have never heard of (BL4?) and got it running. He had a gas can
hanging from a tree, wires hanging and hooked it to his Vanagon for power.
They sat inside the Van and enjoyed the heat till late that night. Anyway
his name is Robert Keezer  (warmerwagen_at_aol_dot_com &lt;mailto:warmerwagen_at_aol_dot_com&gt;
). On a side note, I got to ride in his 82 Vanagon that started life as a
Diesel, he installed an 85-89 Jetta motor with Digifant F.I. Let me tell
you, that is a nice Westy with no power problems. Robert is a great guy, I
would trust with my heater (If I had one). I spent a lot of time with him
this last weekend and he knows his heaters. 
		I pass this on because I know how hard good repairmen are to
find. And I know he is a Man worth the referral.
