Thanks to everyone for the advice, admonishment, and so on. I don't have
time to respond directly to everyone. 

I just had some money things go bad and so my immediate budget for the bus
went down about 90%. So, I'll be trying to do a bare-bones overhaul, enough
to drive it to Eugene so I can camp out in it while I'm changing jobs. I
know this is not a reasonable thing to expect, but I understand that it
probably won't be up to where I want it until I invest a good deal of time
and money (more of either than I have right now). 

So, I am revamping my plan, but it's all up in the air right now. Again,
thanks, and I think I'll just go into lurk mode for a while and absorb some
information while I wait for my John Muir book, my Tom Wilson book and my
Bentley manual to come in. Those Bentley manuals are surprisingly scarce!
Anyone know of a good source, or a good replacement book? Will a Haynes do? 

Thanks once more to everyone. 

JT
