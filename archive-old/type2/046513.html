Subject: [T2] re: T2 heater for bus?

Hi Karl,

Mr Heater's Portable Buddy isn't a furnace, it's a stove.

The difference is very significant. The gasoline, diesel or propane furnaces
from Carver, Stewart-Warner or Eberspacher vent the combustion by-products
outside the vehicle and fill the van with warm, DRY air by way of a
heat-exchanger. The Buddy heater leaves all by-products of combustion
*inside* the vehicle.

I tried out a propane powered catalytic heater in my bus last winter, and
the moisture created by re-combining hydrocarbons and oxygen created a
*HUGE* problem with window fogging and frost. All of a sudden I was to
driving with the vent wings wide open and I'm half freezing to death again.
After as little as half an hour running the heater there was dew (or frost)
pretty much everywhere inside the bus when it cooled down. Dad's 81 vanagon
westy got downright mouldy for a while, until I talked him out of using the
dang thing.

This year, I'm hooking up an Eberspacher under the bus between the frame
rails in place of the big pipe that usually carries the heater box air.

FWIW $.02 Canadian currently is worth about $.015 $US, except that we're
particularly smart regarding heaters. YMMV!!!


Happy trails,

P.S. The Buddy I want keeping me warm is the woman riding in the passenger
seat.

&gt;&gt; What do you think of this device...
&gt;&gt; It looks like it might well work in a bus...
