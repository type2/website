Subject: Looking for Wrecking yard in Vancouver area

Greetings from downunder folks.  I signed off the list some time ago -
the total volumeof my mail meant something had to give.

I find myself travelling to Vancouver for 10 days and I'll have two free
before a conference starts.  I am wondering whether anyone has
suggestions of a good wrecking yard or two in the Vancouver area where I
might find a few small and miscellaneous parts for my '82 Vanagon?  It
just struck me that Vancouver might be a better bet than Brisbane.  It
is difficult to find second hand bits and pieces for these models in
Brisbane (Australia).  Name and address or phone number would be most
useful!

Thanks in advance. - I have 36 hours more to access email before I
leave.  Please reply to MY address, not the list.
