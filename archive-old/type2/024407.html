Heads:

I got a call Thur from the machinists with good news about my heads being 
rebuilt. All they need extra are 3 exhaust studs, about $30. No sunken valve 
seats or anything, in fact he said they were about the best looking heads 
they had seen lately. I sent the heads UPS May 18th, so I'm disappointed it 
took so long. If fact, I called the week before and they said they hadn't 
received them and then said, Oh here they are and blaimed UPS. I guess I can 
be happy they weren't lost.

Maybe the fact that I had my heads rebuild instead of taking the next pair of 
heads off the shelf had something to do with the delay.

Blower Shroud:

I cleaned the front blower housing, but it is still somewhat dingy. Do people 
bead blast these to get the clean look that I've seen on web page photos of 
rebuilds? or is there a product to get the stain out. 

I've seen some photos in our bus books with the housing painted and with a 
white bus, I've thought about painting it white. I'm concerned with the oil 
staining the paint and wondered if anyone had tried this and had any success.
