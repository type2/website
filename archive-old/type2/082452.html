Hello Guys and Richard    Putting water in the clys. will clean the carbon 
off don't know about unsticking rings . You have to be real careful doing 
this and not use too much water.  For unsticking rings the best thing would 
be to fill each of the clys. with ATF and let it sit for a while.  Has worked 
for me before. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem
