Subject: Re: [T2] Painting a Bus

From: &quot;Cha Moon&quot; &lt;ChaMoon_at_vwmail_dot_net&gt;
&gt; very awesome ... i live about 3 hours from the beach maybe 4 in the
bus....
&gt; i use to visit there often till i got married and settled down...
&gt; even lived there for over a couple of months or so once...
&gt; what i might do then is just get the bus painted solid white and take a
drive down and spend a week or so after looking this guy up.../
&gt; great idea.....

If this guy did your bus, I've little doubt you'd have a show-stopper.

We stood there for most of an hour (my son just said &quot;Yea!  I remember!
Wasn't that guy awesome?!) watching the guy turn out incredible panoramas of
people, ships, planets, etc..  It was unreal how he could take common
everyday objects and turn them into &quot;tools&quot;.

I'd check out his work first, before painting the bus white, but it would be
worth the trip to watch him work (You might opt for a black base coat
instead of the white).  You might want to call BotB to see if he's still
performing there, as it's been awhile since we've been up to Myrtle Beach.

He's on the top of the list of folk to see when we're able to take another
trip up to BotB.

BTW, don't pet the manta rays in the Ripley Aquarium and touch your face
without washing the ol' hands first.  Not sure what it was, but it wasn't
kind to my face.  I've still got my good looks {grin}, but it was not a
happy experience watching small portions of my face doing the Rogue thing
(X-Men) in miniature and in reverse.

Of course, no one was interested in treating my face or checking out the
rays (no health insurance).  By the time the local medical hospital would
see me, it was 6 months later and most of the damage had healed.  &quot;If it
comes back, make another appointment.&quot;  Right...
