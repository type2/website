&gt; Part of my very long saga of being burned (twice!) by
&gt; &quot;restorers&quot;, I'm now in search of a replacement windshield for my
&gt; '78 Westy.  I need a source.  ~Checked library - only
&gt; installation info there.  ~Checked archive - a couple of hits,
&gt; only one had the glass: windshieldstogo_dot_com.  They want $142, and
&gt; I have to pick it up in Columbia, SC (I live in Augusta, GA) or
&gt; have it shipped for another $160!!!

when I busted my new windshield trying to put it in I just went ahead
and bit the bullet. I had an installer come out and install it.
SafeLite did it and warranteed it for life. it was much more than $142
but that included seal and window also. HTH
