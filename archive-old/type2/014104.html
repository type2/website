Subject: Re: shift problems

Sounds like the shift coupler is bad.. either the rubbe
bushing or the shaft is broke loose where it mates with the
cage. Make sure you clean it off a bit before trying to see
if the coupler is following the shifter. Mine broke at the
shaft/cage juncture. So the rubber looked good and the slop
wasnt real noticable untill I cleaned the coupler off. Then
it was obvious that the shaft was not following the cage in
rotation. 
&lt;snip&gt;
  I came to a light &amp; went to downshift &amp; the thing would
not go into 2nd. gear. I finally got it to go &amp;....  This
got worse as I got closer to home.  When I backed into the 
driveway it did not want to go into reverse without
grinding. &lt;/snip&gt;
 
OK Tim... enlighten me here... what does the brake fluid
reservoir have to do with shifting... did I miss something
in the post?? BTW Tim, we caught close to a hundred bass
(mostly small) on Orcas island. Thanks for the tip!
&lt;snip&gt;
  There is plenty of brake fluid in the reservoir.  
&lt;/snip&gt;
