Subject: Y2K.....bus?

    I dont mean to start a rumor or anything....BUT......
I was reading the Jan. issue of VW TRENDS the generally BUG BIASED VW
periodical ( I just buy it for the articles I swear!) and noticed this blurb
you all might be interested in..... as follows...

&quot;.......I keep hearing rumors (unsubstantiated at this point), of a new
&quot;Concept Bus&quot; to compliment the New Beetle.....&quot;    Quoted from KAFERDAVE
editorial in VW trends Jan issue. pge8

    I seem to have mixed emotions on this one.  When me and Blue find
ourselves on the same stretch of road as a New Beetle I notice I never get a
wave honk or even the obligatory head nod in response to mine. It is a
sterile and cold relationship that I have noticed in &quot;some&quot; of the new
beetle owners.  They dont seem to understand the importance of their new
vehicle let alone the history that surrounds it. I just assume some &quot;hipster
dufus&quot; (seinfield reference tsk tsk) is cruising around in the latest fad.
Its very disheartening. I find it hard to come up with new excuses to tell
Blue when his feelings are dashed to the asphalt. I shouldn't have to.
    All this brings me to the New Bus. Although jumping the gun a bit, what
will become of that? Will it just create another schism of souls as did the
New Beetle? Rivals? The battle of good and evil on the roadways of the
millenium? Obviously we cant blame the vehicles or even the makers. Its the
owner, or a more sterile term... consumer.... who lacks the education that
should come standard with such a nostalgic purchase. I believe we as a whole
should come up with a pamphlet&quot; Understanding your New Beetle(or Bus) and
your New Responsibilities.:&quot;
    All in all I look forward to progress and am too young to be codgy
(although its coming easier and easier). It is an interesting concept and
would be a tremendous thrill for all of us. Would it model the split or bay?
Spare in front? Tail and headlight placement? options? Engine power? We have
in all our heads designed this particular bus dozens of times. It would be
nice to see the realization of our imaginations. It would be nice to welcome
yet another New member to the family. ( if the member knew the family
existed!)

My first FRIDAY POST  :)
Have a GREAT WEEKEND!!
