I agree with the majority of what you say. Enhancement of function is a
founding stone of the DM. Bolt on wizbang is always sold as an enhancement,
but many times the data proves otherwise, if and when the data should
finally be available. Sales based upon claims and testamonials is a multi
billion dollar per year FRAUD. All a quality product needs to provide is
the data that proves function and it will sell by presentation alone.
Without the data, set-up demonstrations with paid audiences that respond
like Pavlov's dog to the applause light must make the sale, 'cause it can't
be sold with independantly obtained data.

Neandereers don't think you should drink while driving. They put the cup
holders in there under pressure from marketing who were under pressure from
US Yuppies buyers in too big a hurry to pull over and park so they can eat
safely and use the open glove box lid as designed for sensible, safe,
rational behavior. Let's see, burger in left hand, fries in lap, coke in
cup holder. Steer with right hand until the cell phone rings, then steer
with left elbow while cussing the guy slowing you down up ahead. You just
can't do that without a cup holder.

Thanks for your responce,
