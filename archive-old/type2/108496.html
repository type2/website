&gt; Well, I'll be curious to hear from you how it actually defrosts...

To tell the truth, I was considering removing the strips and install a set
of small fans (concealed in the hinge covers, maybe?) powered by the
existing defroster circuit.

I removed the hinge covers to check out what it would take to repro them,
then decided that since someone else was already doing this that it wasn't a
good idea.  But I could remodel them to house those fans...

Gotta think about that one.
