Subject: Re: [T2] 69 split for sale upstate south carolin

well i wondered but you never know till you look at it...

i myself couldnt imagine a 914 in there but that is what the guy told me..
course when i went to buy my bus i was told runs,stops,goes good...
but until yesterday she sat in the carport with oil pouring from her and wouldnt even turn over LOL...

cant imagine someone pawning there bus cause it is at a pawn shop..
the guy didnt act like he knew what he had though..
i will deffinetly go by and check it out either after work or tomorrow when i am off sometime..
peace and thanks jason

&gt;you will get lots of emails that say the same thing.
&gt;
&gt;if it's a 69 its not a split &amp; should have come w/ an upright engine,
&gt;so I kinda doubt someone shoehorned a 914 in there. never hurts to
&gt;check it out though.
