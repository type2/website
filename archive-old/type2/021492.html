&gt; OK - took a recent 1600 mile trip in the 70bus, and it wandered all over
&gt; the road, was tough to handle in winds, etc.
&gt; It should NOT have, as I have replaced:
&gt; all ball joints
&gt; all tierod ends and tierods
&gt; drop lever
&gt; steering dampner
&gt; shocks
&gt; swinglever pin and bushing
&gt; tires were replaced w/ new LT reinforced sidewalls (Bridgestone 603s)
&gt; new steering box
&gt; front end alignment at a long-time VW shop.
&gt; 
&gt; WHAT THE HECK ELSE can I fix? It really has me baffled... last options seem
&gt; to be front torsion arm needle bearings (which supposedly NVER go bad if
&gt; kept greased) and the rubber bushings in the rear trailing arm mounts.
&gt; 
&gt; suggestions appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; other than that, trip was great!!
