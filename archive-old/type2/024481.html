Hi All,

I need to find a Delortto wizard to overhaul my DLRH 40s, they are way past
due for a rebuild and I don't have the time, tools or expertise to attack
this issue.  I am also curious about the electronic ignition thread thats
going on, has anyone used the CB Performance Magnaspark system and fuel
injection?

Thanks,
Brian
Salem, OR
