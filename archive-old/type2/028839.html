&gt;   I  posted a couple of weeks ago about trying to dye my original
&gt; mustard curtains  back into shape, and the general consensus was
fuggeddaboudit.
&gt; So, I spend  an afternoon on the phone with resto shops and fabric
warehouses
&gt; trying to  find something close to the original fabric to make a new set.
&gt; The first place I try sez &quot;nah, we don't have anything like that,
&gt; but you can  check out the bulk upholstery stuff in the back if you want.&quot;
In
&gt; plain sight is a bolt of EXACTLY what I want.  I bought the whole roll,
and
&gt; have already made my new set.  There is enough left to do at least one,
maybe two more


Nice find!  It would be even better if more could be had.  Have you asked
the store if they can get more rolls of it?  Maybe if they could sell
several rolls at once they'd go to the trouble of checking with their
supplier on it.
