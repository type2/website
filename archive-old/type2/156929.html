&gt; Where did this whole Bon Ami ring/seal technique come from??? Anyone?

I've looked at the answer, but I think that it is a lot earlier than the
'50s.  There are references from WWII about using it to seat rings in
aircraft engines.

The product itself has been available since the 1880s, so the &quot;shadetree
mechanic&quot; possibilities are endless!
