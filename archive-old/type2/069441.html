Subject: Re: '71 Westy interior/exterior questions

My 70 westy has the rear tire in the slot over the engine compartment. If you
want I will measure the width of the square mattress part that fits in place
while the wheel is is the slot. I have another part that covers the
slot(wheel well) hole, and this is put in place when you have the bed down. I
did not have any wheel holding mechanisms when I got the bus but I believe
that 71 buss have something different as they have fancy wheels &amp; disc
brakes.
