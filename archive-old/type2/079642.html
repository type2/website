Hiya All,

I'm in the middle of doing some insulating on my 1970 Bus.  I've used Q-pads 
on the doors and in back of the rear seat.  But now I'm looking for an 
insulating product I used about 2 years ago.  It's a closed cell polyfoam 
bonded to a quilted metallic foil.  It's about 3/16ths of an inch thick, 
comes in rolls 3 ft. by 5 ft. and goes by the name Keep Kool.  I have looked 
all over the Portland, OR area (in vain) and just found out that the 
distributor of Keep Kool in this area went belly-up some time ago.
As memory serves, the manufacturer was located in northern California (I 
think).
Is there anybody out there on the List who has seen this stuff, heard of it, 
or knows who to contact or where to get it?  All of my detective work so far 
has led to a dead-end.  I need a hand on this one.  Anybody with a lead?  No 
matter how small.  TIA,

Mike
