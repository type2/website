The 1964 21-window came home from the paint shop last Friday, 
so I need some space and ca$h for it's re-assembly.

Pictures available on the web at:

I know the page is messy, but I didn't view it before I uploaded it.  
what do you expect for something I did while eating lunch?  :)

1969 Westfalia
I am the 2nd Owner
105,900 miles
Fresh rebuilt 1600 SP w/ less than 100 miles
Several minor dents in body
Couple of small rips in poptop canvas
Big rip in poptop cot
*NICE* camper interior

This one is ready to hit the road!

Price is $1500.

Located in Marietta, GA but may arrange for delivery in the 
Southeast.

Please buy it quickly so I can buy my door/window rubber, 
headliner, &amp; sunroof cover!  :)
