I really appreciate everybody who has been trying to help me with both my 
problems.  Some of you have asked what I got...... well here it is.

Its a 72 Transporter with a 1800 T4 engine with a single double barrel weber. 
 I bought the car in september and supposedly the engine was rebuilt and when 
I got it it had only 200 miles on it so its pretty good and it all looks new 
and ran great as of a month ago so I believe the previous owner about the 
rebuild.  I can't recall if he said anything about the carb being fairly new 
but I have had no problems with it when I got the bus and that also looks 
like its new or not that old. Once again thank you and  all your help is much 
appreciated and please keep all the ideas on fixing both my problems coming!

Thank You and Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all,
Jon Rosengrant

Thank
