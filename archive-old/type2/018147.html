Volks,

Ok, I'm perplexed by the recent talk about distributors and advance, and
in particular, about the question of total advance.  The usual figure
floated about for the type I-III engines is 28-32 degrees; but it's been
said that the type IV engine has a signficantly higher total advance.
My question, was the type IV engine somehow DESIGNED for a higher total
advance, or does it simply TOLERATE it better?  On my understanding of
the principls of advancing timing with increased rpms (an understanding,
admittedly, based entirely on Muir's), it seems to me that there's no
difference between the type I-III engine and the type IV engine, 'in
principle' (as Muir might have put it).  It seems to me that the primary
factor affecting advanced timing is the need to get the spark there
earlier in order to have combustion at the right point in the travel of
the piston in the cylinder, and that a host of secondary factors related
to the build of the long-block affecting it  (e.g. compression ratio?)
would vary between different type IV engines as much as between the type
I-III and the type IV, no?  I mean, if a lower total advance is better
for the longevity of a type I-III engine, wouldn't the same be true of
the type IV, even if VW sold them at a higher total advance straight
&gt;from the factory?

My investment in this question is my '74 Campmobile with 2.0l and Weber
progressive.  In order to not have it bucking when coming off idle, I
had to set the initial advance at about 7-10 degrees BTDC, but the stock
distributor (well, 'stock' on my now departed '76) set to this initial
advance ended up at a setting that seemed to me to be way too
high/aggressive, according to the 'conventional wisdom.'  So, I am
running this type IV specific distributor with the vacuum hose
disconnected and plugged, to get a lower total advance of about 30-32
degrees.

Let me just add that I don't want a 'hot' bus, in either sense of that
word.  What I'm after is 'ok' power with 'good' economy and 'very good'
longevity of the engine.  Oh, and I'd like to understand the principles
of this stuff better, regardless of this particular configuration, which
I regard as a temporary arrangement until I set it up for the stock
PDSITs or FI ('stock' here refering either to the '74 bus or to the 2.0l
engine).
