Subject: Bus mileage (was capacity/'71 westy)

Hi,
	A while back I collected all the reports I could find on fuel
consumption into a table and posted it. It's available at:

http://www.type2_dot_com/library/fuel/specs.htm

	...thanks to the efforts of the type2 library maintainers.

 The numbers I was getting when I posted this could stand correction,
as I have since found and fixed a carburettor fault. Nevertheless,
I'm still only getting 16.5 mpg(US) on average.

 One thing to note when comparing the upright to pancake engine figures
is that the pancake (especially the 2.0l) uses more fuel because it CAN
use more fuel: I used to drive my '71 (and '68) at 50-55mph and get 
20mpg but now that I have a 2.0L '77 I drive 70-75mph and get 16.5mpg..
but I also arrive sooner!

 I think the summary figures are about right, tending to the optomistic
because people generally report good numbers rather than bad ones.

 It also depends how you use your bus, of course. If you check your
mileage on a road trip you'll get good numbers: you tuned it before 
you set off, you are paying attention to it because you need to get
home and you are probably cruising to enjoy the view. Check your 
mileage on a bus that's used as a daily driver in town, stop and go
commuter traffic, rushing around to get to &amp; from work with lots of
throttle &amp; brake and the numbers will be way down, but you probably
don't have time to log them, and even then you drop them from the stats 
because you know that the bus needs a tuneup (maybe _next_ weekend?)
and so they arn't &quot;representative&quot;...

 It's human nature. The nature of the bus is that it's heavy, has 
an old fashioned engine and the aerodynamics of an outhouse. On the 
other hand it's value is about level, so what you spend in fuel you 
save in depreciation, loan interest etc. Plus you get to drive a 
cool car...

Cheers,
	 W.
