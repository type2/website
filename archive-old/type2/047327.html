&gt;Hi all,

&gt;     The 76 westy I am selling has a dual battery system in it.  I do not
&gt;think the aux. battery is charging.  It is down to 10 volts.  The PO had a
&gt;Ford 3-post relay in it &amp; when I got it, I hooked it up to the coil.
&gt;Everything was fine until now.  If the relay is bad, what is the proper one
&gt;to use?  Thanks.

You can get a replacement 3-post relay that looks similar to the Ford one from any Camping World for about 11 bucks.  It has a metal case and will probably last the life of your bus.
