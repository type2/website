&gt;       1: I was looking at wiper blades in the RMMW catalog and I see
&gt; that they have &quot;suspended&quot; and &quot;unsuspended&quot; blades available.  What is
&gt; the difference and which do I need?

Un-suspended.  The suspended ones are &quot;sprung&quot;  

&gt;       2: I need one new headlight assembly (i.e. glass lens, bucket
&gt; thing, etc.) can I use a beetle one or does anyone have a spare one for
&gt; sale?

Bug and bus ones are different.  Bugs have the adjusting screws 180
degrees apart; busses have them less than 90 degrees apart, on either
side of the mounting screw.  THey will fit, but the light will be
pointing the wrong way.

&gt;       4: I'm replacing some brake lines along with the master cylinder
&gt; and the whole brake system is dry.  How much brake fluid is needed for the
&gt; whole system?

Not a lot.  By a couple quarts, and work it thru, to help clean it out.
