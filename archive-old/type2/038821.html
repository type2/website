Subject: no maintenance = break down

Hi volks, seems I never have time to post here anymore, but do scan the
subject headings for interesting threads.  Times have changed over the last
5-6 years:)  

Ohhh the pain of relearning lessons.  You can not keep missing regular
maintenance!  I knew the dangers, and I got bit.  Interested in hearing the
story?  Read on.  

I'm down to one bus these days, a 73 camper with a nice interior and an old
FI 2liter from a 76.  I had a 72 with a sweet 1800 w/stock dual solexes.
This is the engine I have worked on for several years, and it was running
great, but the chasis left a little to be desired.  To make a long story
short, I sold the 72 with a sweet motor, and kept my current 73.  

The motor is tired and I know nothing of FI.  I always wanted FI, but
forgot about the learning curve.  My desire and available time to work on
the bus has been declining.  Starting all over again, fixing oil leaks,
fixing little stuff, eventually a rebuild, plus learning the FI.  It seemed
a little overwhelming, and I've been wondering if maybe my bus ownership
time has come to an end (or a respite).  I'm not whinning, just looking at
life. 

Well, as you can guess, I haven't been my ussual mechanic self, allowing
basic maintenance and tune up to slip.  In 6 years of bus ownership I have
broken down twice, and that was in the beggining.  Since then I've never
been stuck anywhere with the bus.  I attribute it to love, karma, and
regular maintenace (and the knowledge of how to do that maintenance and
why).  With all three declining a bit, the bus taught me a lesson.  

Rough running, much less power then normal (none up hill), hard to start,
hard to hold an idle without dying, and finally died at a stop light.  I had
a guess as to what was the problem, I bet some others do as well......

And yep I was right.  The points had completely closed up, not to mention
badly pitted.  It had been a while (way to long) since a tuneup.  I deserved
it.

Out with the tool box.  No feeler gauges!  Well that sucks.  No flashlight?
ohhh, pitty.  So with a rag and screwdriver, I went to the rear and opened
the points, with my best guess at .020.  Then a few light scapes with an
emory board to remove the raised surfaces on the points.  Rotor and cap back
on, and the bus fired right up.  Sounded better than it has in months
(although is that ticking louder, or is it the exhaust:).  Ran better with
more power as well.  What else would you expect.  Then because I needed it,
I grabbed my plastic squirt boat and paddled the lake for a while.  Mmmmm
buses and kayaks still make me smile.  The best shuttle vehicle is a bus!
Pop tops are and added bonus for changing in cold/windy weather.

So this weekend its time to get down and dirty.  Time for the basic
maintenance.  Gotta do it.  After that, I'll decide if I have the time and
gumption to learn about the FI.  

Hope all is well with everyone out there in cyberbus land.  may all
cylinders fire, and your brakes never fail:)

take care,
