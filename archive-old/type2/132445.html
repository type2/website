Subject: Bad post apology

Hey, All.
Sorry for the reference to ebay in my post re: the 050 dizzy. That was
something that was added to the charter since I joined way back in the
lenti_dot_edu days, and I skipped out during the discussion regarding those type
of posts.
As my penance, I will reread the charter ten times, and promise to never
violate it again.
Please accept my apologies.
