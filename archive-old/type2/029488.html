Wasnt this a Type4 engine? 
At any rate this is way premature and disheartening advice to give.
There a quite a few possibilities for low oil pressure before you decide
to throw over a thousand dollars at it.
Oil pump, low idle, hot oil or engine in general etc etc...
Missing seals, clogged cooler, lean running.
And align boring a type 4 engine is not standard practice.
Eliminate the cheap possibilities before throwing big cash at it.
