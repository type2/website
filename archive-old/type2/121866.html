Subject: RE: [T2] '72 Bus-A Year to Avoid?

Jeff, and List-ites:

Hmm, onions/orchids for a '72?!?  Avoid it?  Not only no, but h*ll no!
The Weber proggy would make me avoid it, but I'm a fan of low-down 'n
dirty front turn signals, early stylie bumpers, disc brakes, and
b*lls-to-the-walls Type4s, and not that it makes that much difference
now, but the '72 would have had the least emissions control goo of the
Type4 equipped models.  No engine access hatch - piffle!  That's what
your sawz-all is for, buddy ;-)

Now you want a year to avoid because of too much one-year only stuff?
How about 1967?  1966?  1965?  1964?  1963-now THAT'S a year to avoid!
1962?  1961? Anything with a 36-hp 1200cc motor, or reduction gear boxes
for that matter - JMHO.  YMMV!
