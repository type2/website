Subject: So a fellow paints his bus

Lighten up.

He painted his bus.
He likes his bus.
He ain't Vincent Van Gone.

He drives his bus.
He likes his bus.
He ain't AJ Foyt.

He will do more work on his bus.
He will like his bus more.

He will drive his bus more.
He will like his bus more.

Now then, I'm out of line,
and off base.
Sorry
