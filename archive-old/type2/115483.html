.....
&gt; It is not the vendors job to read your mind and figure out that you don't
&gt; know what parts you need to make an upgrade work. RTFM beforehand and you
won't
&gt; have the problem.


Well in the case where these alternators are sold as a direct replacement, a
little not in the catalog would be appreciated...but I bet they would not
sell many, for what person that owns a stock alternator setup is just going
to happen to have tha boot lying around?
