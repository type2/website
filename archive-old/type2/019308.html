Subject: Tune-up woes

After our recent attempt to do a tune-up yesterday we are here with a
lousily (?) running bus.  My husband did figure out the correct order
for the spark plug wires, so that is ok.  We managed to set the points
(boy did that take long time) and change the plugs, cap and rotor.  The
symptoms now are that it runs well out on the road or anytime your foot
is on the gas pedal, but if you take foot off the gas it dies right
out.  We did find a vacuum hose that was disconnected but suspect there
is another one that is either cracked or disconnected but cannot find
it.  Any ideas?  I hate to give up and take it in to get looked at
because I was very psyched about doing this ourselves, but it runs worse
not than before we started.  Tell me not to give up, please! thanks,
Beth and the 1978 Hippychickmobile.
