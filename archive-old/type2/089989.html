Subject:  RE: [T2] Why VW buses die


It seems that my vehicles' demise usually start
when the air conditioner breaks.  Then the tranny
goes, then the oil consumption increases, etc. In the
case of my last American car, when it got to that
point, I traded it for my first type 2.  The vehicle
didn't stop getting real service, just became unenjoyable
to drive.


I have a Taurus with 150,000 miles on it.  The A/C needs a manifold hose, 
about $500 w/labor. The wiper switch needs replacing; I have a alarm box that 
has dangled down because the PO tried to tear it out of the car plus it is 
very rusty.  So, I am in the market for a different vehicle myself. Which 
brings me to the required type 2 content.  I would love to own a type 2, but 
I have some reservations.  1.  I can only afford 1 vehicle so it would have 
to be my daily driver.  2 not sure how it would go in the ice and snow 
assuming we have any this year (after this drought who knows). And, 3.  the 
endless horror stories I read from people about break downs.  I only commute 
around town and am not afraid to tinker with it.  Add to that the scarcity of 
type 2s for sale in my area and you can see why I am reluctant.  Dave.
