Subject: Ignition Switch

Hey folks, thanks for all the help with my ignition switch issue.
I feel like such an amateur.

Since it's friday, I'll post this story. (it's a good one)

So the key wasn't working, I went to a local shop and had one cut from
the old key.   Still no luck.
I contacted the list for advice and found out that I can't cut the key
with the VIN. So I think, I'll deal with it when I have more time to
remove the door lock.  So I decide to do some work with the 76 westy and
go to start it and I'm missing my ignition key.  What the _at_**!!  This
day isn't going too well yet and it's only 3pm.  I dig into my pockets
and find... two ignition keys for the westy...  one freshly cut.
Riiight...  I'll stop there.  You can figure out the rest.  All's well
in LA LA LAND.  LOL at myself
