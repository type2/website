Subject: Re: [T2] Heater control box to accordion tube cuffs

Keep in mind that the Bus or Vanagon &quot;cuffs&quot; were not originally supplied as
a replacement separately with the accordian hoses.  It's only later on when
VW finally learned of the asbestos problem that they started supplying the
silicone &quot;cuffs&quot; for the Type 1 and Bus to 79 Accordian Hoses (the Vanagon
red ones were originally silicone, beefy looking pieces as shown on
ratwell's site and never have been available separately new).

Your can get the proper silicone (grey) for the Type 1 and Bus to 79 here
(plenty in stock):

(111 819 945 OE)

Or you can keep searching for that junker 80-83.5 aircooled vanagon to rob
the beefier red ones from ;-)

&gt; While replacing the heater control boxes on my wife's 73 Westy I've
&gt; found that the metal and asbestos cuffs which go between the control
&gt; box and the accordion tube have disintegrated.
&gt; I'm having trouble sourcing the cuffs.  After reading item #5 on
&gt; http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Heating.html I'd prefer the silicone
&gt; Vanagon ones (251-255-393D) over asbestos, but at this point I may
&gt; just take what I can get.  Other than finding donor bays/Vanagons,
&gt; does anyone have a source?
&gt; Thanks
