Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Ball Joint Replacement

Another plug for the *only* VW repair shop I have ever had good experiences 
with.  I had my ball joints replaced at Meyers Foreign in Las Vegas, 
NV.  If it is within 500 miles of you, I would make the trip to have them 
do the job.  The price was very fair and they did top notch work.

&gt;Not every shop with a press can install the T2 ball joints properly. 
&gt;Special tools are required. See Bentley where the VW 471 peening tool is 
&gt;called out.
&gt;
&gt;Many shops that claim to have changed many T2 ball joints never have heard 
&gt;of this tool.  I would avoid them.
