&gt; Thanks for all the suggestions, it ended up being the horse shoe clip broke

&gt; I still don't know where that nut in the other side came from. Oh well, at 
&gt; least I learned you don't have to take off the axle nut to get to the brakes

Nathan (and all),

I would not trust a double nut not to repeat what you just went thru.  I
have had this happen to me with just that settup.  I like the pin and clip
arrangement that was stock, tho I would understand if you didn't after
your experience.  If you (or anyone) needs to repeat this job and go the
nut-and-bolt route, I would recommend using nylock nuts, or peening the
bolt after you tighten the nuts together.  Having that nut come loose is
more than a bit of a safety hazard!
