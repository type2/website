Subject: Re: [T2] 84 Westy, &quot;RTFM&quot; type question]

Thanks, Karl,

My Westy's supplementary camper manual (page 12) says, &quot;Bear in mind 
that in addition to the normal vehicle electricity used for lights, 
ignition radio, etc.,&quot; (which clearly refers to the main vehicle 
battery), &quot;your battery also feeds the interior light over the sink, the 
refrigerator, water pump, control lights in the sink cabinet, and any 
appliance plugged into the plug on the dashboard.&quot;

So I am confused. The manual refers to one single battery. Perhaps I do 
not have a deluxe Westy? How can one tell? And if this is not a deluxe, 
perhaps the space under the driver's seat is empty.

(I would look except that the Westy is at an upholsterer's getting new 
covers on the seats and mattress pads.
