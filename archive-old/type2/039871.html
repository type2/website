&gt;Guys,
&gt;Where can I buy a Bentleys for my 75 type 2?

&gt;I have a copy of John Muirs book (I love it!)...
&gt;


Powells_dot_com for any new or used book. I always check them first. In the
rare case they don't have what I want, then I check Amazon and others. The
apes at powells are infallible. If something goes wrong, they scatter and
find out and fix it NOW, ie TODAY. They are truely outstanding and SERVICE
oriented cum laude. MUCH better results with just a little extra effort.
They may not know it, but their procedures reek of the DM.
