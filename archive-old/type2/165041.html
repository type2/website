Subject: Re: [T2] Heater fan

Go to:
http://www.type2_dot_com
then go to the Library, then Wiring Diagrams/Schematics, then Air cooled VW Wiring Diagrams Online.  The only problem may be that there isn't one for a 1975.  There are for 1974 and 1976 but not 1975.  But then according to my Bentley, the 1973 through 1975 are the same.

Hope this at least kind of helps.

&gt; Ok, the temps are in the 40's here, good time to fix the heat in my bus. 
&gt; 
&gt; When I bought it, there was no blower in the engine compartment. I got one, 
&gt; have no clue how to hook it up. Any pics, diagrams, or ideas for me? 
&gt; thanks,
