&gt; How many miles are on the other buses out there?  Who's got the record?
&gt; 

We have a '79 Camper with a scant 106,000 miles on it, less than 6,000
on the rebuilt engine. We bought it in November of 1992, with 64K miles
for $3500. It is a California model, so has all the pollution control
devices, as well as electronic ignition and fuel injection. It has auto
trans, and body is in pretty good shape, except for some rust appearing
around windshield and rear window seals. I have wondered what it would
be worth on the market, but I don't believe I could part with it (much
to my spouses regret!). It is serviced very lovingly by the gang at D&amp;A
Auto Service in Pinellas Park, Florida (813-541-1407).
