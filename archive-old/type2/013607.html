Subject: Weber on a suby?
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id JAA37865

List,
I'm gonna cross post this to the suby conversion list as well, but wanted to
run it past you guys.

The suby engine i have access to for my conversion (into 71 bus) is a
throttle-body FI system. Run away! Run away!

The local buggy shop says they have seen good performance out of the 2bbl
weber on these engines and can fab the adapter plate for me.
I know it is maligned on the type4, but i wonder if anyone has run one on a
suby. Pretty sure this is a DOHC 1800cc engine.

Thanks for any and all info,

clark
