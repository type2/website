Subject: 72 Westy Seat ?s

I think this applies to all early z beds so, can someone tell me the
purpose of the spring loaded metal swing arms on the z bed. What was
their purpose and how are they suppose to work. If you manually adjust
them you can get them to rest in the studs that come out and seam to be
for this swing arm. However if you do this the back of the bed is
upright facing the rear of the bus, any clues?

Also how was the fabric attached to the back part of the jump seat. The
original westy stuff was gone and P.O. left me wondering how is was
originally. I still had a few snap buttons so I think this must be the
way it was attached, is this so, only with snaps?

I was wondering if the scrap piece of original westy curtain material
that I removed from the closet door window covering would be of interest
to any one. Is is not usable for any thing but a pattern, the color is
still good around the edges so that would help. If not it will go in the
trash, if you do want it it might be a while before I can get it out,
HOSS is taking all of my free time now.

Thanks
Meredith
