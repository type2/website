&gt; Hi again,
&gt; 
&gt; Well the last message worked, so here's another one.
&gt; 
&gt; Regarding the recent isolator vs. relay discussion, you might want
to check
&gt; out the site at the end of this message.
&gt; 
&gt; They have comparison data on which works better.  (Since they mainly
sell
&gt; isolators, guess which one they say is best?)  (I also noticed that
they
&gt; don't happen to mention the 1 volt drop you get using the isolator.)

The actual URL for the isolator VS relay paper is:

http://www.surepower_dot_com/pdfs/isolatorsolenoid.pdf

Note that this is a PDF file, so you have to have the Adobe reader
installed before you can look at this paper.

From reading the paper, it seems that the only fault that they can
find with relays is corrosion of the contacts.  In the relay-based
systems I've used, this problem has never surfaced.  They say that
vehicles use breakerless ignitions now because of the problem with
mechanical contacts.  This is true, but if relays are all that bad
shouldn't we also be using solid-state starter solenoids as well?

BTW, the better isolators get around the problem of voltage drop by
sensing the voltage downstream of the isolator.  This voltage is fed
to the alternator's regulator which fools the alternator into
producing the extra voltage needed to overcome the isolators drop.  I
don't know if this applies to the VW setup, though.

Sure Power was the manufacturer of the isolator that left me stranded
at night on a dirt road in the Mojave after one of the diodes opened. 
This allowed my deep-cycle auxilary battery to charge and my main
battery to go flat.  I couldn't start from the deep cycle battery
(starting damages them) so I had to wait for a kind soul to happen by
who could give me a jump after I removed the isolator from the
circuit.  It was a bear to diagnose too!

I'll stick to relays, thank you!

George Lyle
