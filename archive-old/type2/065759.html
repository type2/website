Subject: RE: leaky carb: Solex 34 PICT-3

This is a follow-up to my own message. I figured that there might be a
lot of folks running stock dual-port 1600 engines that might want to
know how they can revive their worn Solex 34 PICT-3 carburetors.

I took some of the info from folks on the list (thanks!) and asked
around Seattle. The bushings are available, but kind of hard to find.
The VW dealers here say they haven't seen them in a few years. I found
that the mostly-VW parts place called Bow Wow (206/523-9200) have the
bushings on order and charge only a few bucks for them. They recommended
Lewis Foreign Car (206/524-3366) as the machine shop to use, because
they had done the bushing job on a lot of these Solex 34 PICT-3s. The
installation will cost about $25. Cool.

Thanks for all your help, and I apologize for not knowing how to spell
&quot;carburetor&quot; in my original post.

&gt;
&gt;I've got a '71 pop-top in which I'd like to put an original German Solex
&gt;34 PICT-3 carbuerator. The carb is not perfect, however, in that the
&gt;throttle shaft is loose where it goes throught the body of the carb on
&gt;one side. It tends to leak a little gas.
&gt;
&gt;I'm told that this is a common problem with old 34 PICT-3s.
&gt;
&gt;I know of one company, the Carberator Refactory in Richmond, Califonia,
&gt;that repairs these carbs by enlarging the whole the shaft runs through
&gt;and pressing in a bronze bushing. The shaft then runs through the
&gt;bushing, which is drilled to fit perfectly. I don't have the money to
&gt;buy a rebuilt carb from them, but I was thinking of having the bushing
&gt;put in by a local (Seattle) machine shop, then rebuilding the carb
&gt;myself.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone ever done this? The machine shop I spoke to said that I would
&gt;have to come up with the bushing myself, then they would figure out what
&gt;it would take to put it together.
