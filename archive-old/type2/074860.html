Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump for a 78

&gt; &gt; That was the Bus depot that has listed in their online
&gt; &gt; catalog rebuilt pumps for ~$127.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Interesting...where did you find that?  We sell brand new fuel pumps for
&gt; $143 with listmember discount (our part # GFP301).  If there are rebuilt
&gt; ones somewhere on my site for $16 less, it's actually news to me. I've
sure
&gt; never sold one...

Maybe it was us.  We have a rebuilt one available for $127.95 exchange.
