Subject: Anyone need a Type 3 Bentley at wholesale?

Any bus owners out there also own a Type 3?
My Bentley manual supplier just shipped me a Type 3 Manual that I didn't 
order and don't want. Before I return it for a refund, I thought I'd offer 
it to anyone who might want it at wholesale cost, which is $20 plus 
shipping. (Retail is $35, I think). If you want it, just let me know ASAP, 
before I return it.
Thanks,
Ron Salmon
