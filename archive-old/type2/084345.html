Subject: Re: [T2] electrical woes... ugh...

Get an ammeter (good VOM's usually have this function to at least 5
amps).  In the dark, repeatedly touch the positive lead briefly onto the
+ terminal- the size of the spark will tell you the load.  Put the VOM
between the pos terminal and the lead when it's set to ammeter function-
will tell you the draw.   Hmmm- how big a draw will drain a 60 amp hr
battery to below 9 volts in 2 days?

&gt; &lt;&lt; The big thing to remember, while testing for a &quot;leak&quot; in your electrical
&gt; system.... make sure you have the dome lights off,, and if you have a radio
&gt; with
&gt; preset memory,,, it will cause a small glow in the lamp also,, you might want
&gt; to
&gt; disconnect it also. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Absolutely left field battery drain: Buddy of mine put a recycled radio in his
&gt; work truck. Same problem, every few days the battery would be flat. Turned
&gt; out to be a short in the auto antenna circuit...Thing was trying to raise a
&gt; fixed
&gt; antenna...
