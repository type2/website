Hey Richard

        I've been thinking about this hand-cranking thing myself.  Each spark
plug fires
at 7.5 degrees BTDC (if you've got a 009).  That does leave the possibility of
the plug
firing and generating sufficient power before the piston reaches TDC to
overpower my
skinny arm and drive the engine backwards a few revolutions, thereby breaking
or
injuring my arm/shoulder, etc.
        My Dad has a 1968 HD sportster with a kick start.  To prevent kickback
and
broken legs, there is a speed release clamp (like on the front wheel of a fancy
bicycle)
which secures the distributor against rotating.  Before starting the bike.  He
releases
the clamp and rotates the distributor to a specific mark and reclamps it.  At
that mark,
the plugs fire one (or whatever) degrees after TDC, eliminating the possibility
of
kickback.  After the bike is running, he returns the distributor to its
original
position.  To make the whole thing very easy, there is a steel tab sticking out
of the
side of the distributor which bumps up against steel tabs sticking up
vertically from
the distributor clamp at the proper setting.
        A standard VW distributor clamp could be modified with a welder, two
steel tabs,
a timing light, a wing nut (or tabs welded to the 10 mm nut already there) and
a pencil.
 I would put the vertical steel tabs at 2 degrees after and 7.5 degrees before
TDC.
I've thought about it but haven't done it yet, so it's probably a little more
complicated than it sounds.  It'll happen some day...
        Hey! So far, I've needed the crank start two times.  One time I was
shining the
truck lights at the greenhouse while mixing compost and I kindly got distracted
for a
few hours.  Then when it rained last week, I left my lights on when I got to
work.
Sooo, that's kinda neat.
                                        Have a nice day.  Ray.
