Subject: Re: [T2] Re replacing old hyd lifters with new(the 231K bus)

It is not uncommon to resurface lifters when an engine is rebuilt and run
them on an old camshaft. However the cam should be examined for wear
prior to running the resurfaced lifters. In all repair manuals it tells
us to return the same lifter to the same lobe in a situation where the
lifters are removed. This has little importance if the lifters have been
resurfaced or new lifters have been installed.
In your situation I'd say that new lifters have done you no harm but I
fail to see that new lifters are any better than the old lifters since
the lifters lay on their side and some of them always bleed down
overnight.

Perhaps you had the Air Lock experience with your lifters, I've never had
it but I believe that it is more than fantasy.

&gt; Regarding the necessity (Jack Raby?) of matching new cams with new

&gt; What, you mean that I shouldn't have gone 131,000 mi on the hyd 
&gt; lifters
&gt; replaced around 100K by a local mechanic who claimed I needed them 
&gt; after
&gt; I was noticing clatter and was ignorant about just letting them 
&gt; pump
&gt; up?  Obviously they were not matched any more to the old cam????
&gt; 
&gt; I speak partly in jest, since I agree a cam and lifter wear 
&gt; together-I
&gt; remember very long ago taking apart a (bug?) engine and noticing 
&gt; the
&gt; wear visible in the lifter which obviously was matching the wear in 
&gt; the
&gt; cam lobe.  I recall using very crude tools to machine the case to 
&gt; allow
&gt; later, thicker lifters to fit, as the older ones were in danger of
&gt; manufacturing &quot;washers&quot; (:  Obviously adding an old to a new would
&gt; increase wear as some surfaces will be under a greater load than
&gt; before!  So is there any advice regarding replacing hyd lifters 
&gt; (which
&gt; is very easy)- such as if the old has a flat surface it's OK??
