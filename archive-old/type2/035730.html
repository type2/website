Subject: RE: Deal on Boge shocks!

 When he said that nose dive was &quot;greatly
&gt;improved&quot; when changing from his OEM shocks, this makes me think that the
&gt;real culprit was that his old shocks were worn (a condition that certainly
&gt;could result in increased nose dive).  Thus, the degree of improvement may
&gt;likely have had much to do with the fact that he replaced worn old shocks
&gt;with good new ones.

I must suggest that this idea should be considered the foundation of a
great many testimonials, which are not data, but full of biases based upon
perceptions without benefit of true experimental process wherein all
variables are identified and controlled. 

Example: Motor running poorly, replace OEM worn plugs with new wizbang. At
the same time, adjust timing and mixture. Motor runs much better. False
conclusion: improvement was from wizbang. Unproven but likely real
foundation of the improvement was related to readjustment to specs. and
better spark energy of new wizbang compared to worn OEM. Testamonials are
not data. 

Consider also, if someone spends bucks on wizbang, they are biased toward
subjective perception of  good results 'cause they wish to show how very
good their money has been spent, without benefit of measured objective data
to prove or disprove efficacy.
