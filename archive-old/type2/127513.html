Subject: north seattle junkyards

&quot;&quot;There is a good size junkyard off of the Mukilteo
speedway in Mukilteo
Washington, there is also Schaffner Motors, I have
dealt with neither yard so I am not sure of their
reputation.  The Busco_dot_com is a Seattle shop and has
fair pricing.
Good Luck Dave&quot;&quot;

---The people who run the yard off Mukilteo speedway
are
pretty decent.. Havent been there to often tho..
Rudi..
the owner of Schaffner motors is 4 star IMHO. He is
just getting back from knee surgery so dont know how
much time he is spending at the shop.. very organized
yard though.
Ken.. who runs the BusCo is also a great guy.. he
organizes the Burgermeet in July which is the day
before vintagemeet....  both Ken and Rudi have a
realistic view of the value of the parts they have on
hand..
