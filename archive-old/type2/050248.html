I remember that song.

also had a friend years ago when I lived in Germany that shipped a clasic
weapon (pistol) home in pieces over many months, shortly after the last
part was shipped he got a package from US customs with a very nasty letter
and his fully assembled pistol in the box

I doubt they would put a VW together for you....

now when I lived in Germany I had taken my then VW to Germany with me
(talk about taking coals to Newcastle) and while there did a LOT of
modifications and even put a &quot;Not avaliable&quot; engine in it, when I brought
it home it went right through customs without a word, but I did use a
professional freight forwarder.  Of course to the average joe it looked
like the same car I shipped to Europe two years earlier too, and ALL the
numbers still matched.. and this was a few years ago too
