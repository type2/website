Subject: RE: [T2] What did I do wrong?

&amp;gt;What sort of oil leaks would be associated with a bad overheating episode?
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;What are the most likely suspects for my leak coming back so soon?
&amp;gt;

Warped head? At least that's happened to me with a wasser cooled engine. 
But...is the oil leaking from the same place as before? Or does it leak from 
somewhere else?


&amp;gt;Was I really foolish not to check my timing after re-installing the engine? 
&amp;gt;It never occured to me that it would change, so if it did, why?
&amp;gt;

When doing major repair work it always pays to recheck the valves and 
timing. But I doubt that timing being off a bit would cause an oil leak.
