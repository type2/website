Subject: Re: [T2] Tires for Westy

[...]


&gt; After more than a year of desultory work, we are getting ready to get China
&gt; Cat on the road. She's a 75 Westy.
&gt;
&gt; The tires that are on her are in good condition, but I question their
&gt; suitability. They are Michelin Radial XH, P205/R15, rated at 695 lbs max load.

I really really hope the max load number you typed is a misprint, otherwise
those are wheelbarrel tires!
Minimum load weight per tire is 1540 lbs.
