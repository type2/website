Subject: RE: [T2] BusFusion 2004 Trip Report

Greg and BP and Type 2 Listees,

Great Report. I have been on the type 2 list for about 5 months now and
I really look forward to your comments and the positive attitudes you
present. I enlist to the BP mailing list as well. I just enjoy reading
all of the email. Please do not feel like I am a stalker to the potts
family, or Adooom, or Jamie, etcccc.... I envy the VW relations that you
all have. Being in Southeast Idaho. We have a desire to have a club. We
tried a meet last year with about 30 cars. Went over great. No campouts
though. I really have considered making the drive to BOTC or Busfusion
or Everybus. Long Drive. Plus I currently have 4 kids under the age of
three. Hard to travel with that many, need two busses. One westy, one
standard for all of the car seats and diapers alone. Ha Ha. Perhaps I
enjoy living thru the events by reading the various reports that you all
post and some day I will be able to restore both of my buses to
potential to make such a long haul. I will post questions on how to get
there and I frequent the Type 2 Libraries and thesamba_dot_com .

Basically keep up your trip reports and the dialog that you keep, I
enjoy it.
