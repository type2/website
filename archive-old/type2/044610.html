I think any vehicle that gets towed out of a pasture is going to be &quot;high 
maintenance&quot;, at least initially.  I bought my '71 Westy with 70,000 miles on 
it about 17 years ago.  It now has over 250,000 MI's on it and I've found it 
to be extremely reliable and inexpensive to own.  My experience is that buses 
are low maintenance, low cost and very reliable.  I hope that you find that 
to be true the longer you own your bus.
