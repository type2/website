Subject: Re: [T2] Benefits of FI

Benifits?

Proper fuel metering to each cylinder at any given throttle position,
any load, any speed.

That is --if it's functionig properly---:&gt;)

This is probably a good time to ask this. I've been thinking about
putting fuel injection back onto my '77 bus. The PO removed the FI setup
and replaced it with a weber progressive. Could some of the people that
have FI tell me the benefits of having it? I'm aware of better gas
mileage and I like the idea of no more icing in cold weather, what else?
My bus budget is pretty tight right now, and I'm 
hesitant to do the switch. Learning everything isn't a issue, I enjoy
it. I've 
read as much as I can get my hands on, Type2 archive and Library plus
the chapter in the Bentley. I have a almost complete FI system on hand.
I'm afraid I'm going to switch over and have half the parts fail leaving
me with a large bill... 
Please direct any thoughts to me. 
thanks
