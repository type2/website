Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Rattle can epoxy primer

What I do , and works well for durability is acid etch the metal clean
after the bodywork is done, lay a coat of Dupont's Vari Prime acid etch
primer over everything.
I will hold down and old finish and prevent it from swelling and lifting
as well as etch the bare metal.

It sit overnight, and then is sanded with 320.
Then I apply a heavy coat of Uro prime, a three part urethane
primer/sealer over the acid etch.
24 hour total cure time, and then sanded and top coated, with PPG
Concept  Base/ Clearcoat
It's like putting a plastic bag over the acid etch, and a tough ,
flexible sealer.

Here's an idea in durability for the nose of the vehicle, and anywhere
you might be worried about stone chips and abrasion.

Toss an ounce of flex agent ( rubber bumper flexative ) into the clear
coat.

It'll cause the urethane to be even more flexible, and the stone chips,
door chips etc. will be a thing of past, but yet it will lay down super
flat and nice with the Concept clear, and it's totally wet sandable,
rubbable, and Finesseable.

You'll never know it's in the clear--only the bugs and rocks will.

This is the way to a bullet proof, UV, chip resistant finish.
