Subject: oil pump vs cam

Hey y'all.
I've another oil pump related question.  the Melling has a flat across
drive tang.  the cam (3 bolt) has a dished slot where the oil pump drive
tang engages.  the slot is probably almost 1 mm wider than the tang,
allowing for some slop.  Are these 2 compatible?  If not, what should I
look for in the oil pump to prevent grenading?  anyone need a
blueprinted and nicely flowed Melling?
