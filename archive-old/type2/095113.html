Subject: Re:Ball Joint Replacement


To: Kyle J Pendleton
From: Chuck Watson

Not every shop with a press can install the T2 ball joints properly. Special 
tools are required. See Bentley where the VW 471 peening tool is called out.

Many shops that claim to have changed many T2 ball joints never have heard 
of this tool.  I would avoid them.

If you decide to do it your self. Talk to a place like Wolfgang 
International 530 246-4264. They sell the torsion arms with new joints 
installed. Ask them about proper joint installation.

Chuck
