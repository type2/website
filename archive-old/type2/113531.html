Subject: Bosch Grease

Several people inquired about genuine Bosch Grease. I have checked current 
availability and note the following types:

Ft1v4, 5 700 002 005, Distributor Grease (for the points block), 45ml $11.55
Ft40v1, 5 700 102 005, Battery Grease (for terminal protection), 45ml $7.50
Ft1v36, 5 700 014 082, Universal Grease (for moving, heavy loads), 20ml, $18.90

There are a dozen or so more listed on the price sheets but I have no info 
as to what they are specified for.

Since I must pay shipping to me then to you, I can not do better than the 
prices shown, plus $4.00 shipping USPS lower 48 for up to one pound, 
whether one or several tubes. Place your orders and I will get enough for 
everyone who wants some.

Regards,
