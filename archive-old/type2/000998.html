Hi All,

I am trying to finish off the interior of my 77 Westi but I cannot find two
parts.  I wanted to know if anyone has them or knows where to get them.  I
need the passengers rear cot flange (with the screws if possible) and also
two male snap buttons (with screws if possible)  that screw into the body to
hold the rear bug screen.

Thanks,
