Hello everybody,

I was wondering if i put into my t4 2000 engine another spark plugs like the
ones used for electronic fuel injected driven engines, the ones with 3 or 4
terminals on the head of the spark plug, would i get lower engine temps
because of better ignition and burning of the fuel? I also use my engine
with LPG and i think it would ignite the gas better. Does anybody have any
experiences with using diferent types of spark plugs?
