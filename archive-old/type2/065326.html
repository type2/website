&gt; I think pure sodium can explode when exposed to the atmosphere.  My
&gt; chemistry teacher in college kept the sodium immersed in oil.
&gt; 

Pure sodium of course reacts with water, including that in the
atmoshpere hence storage under kerosene usually.  As to how it reacts,
burns, violently.  Though in normal atmoshpere I think it usually just
oxidizes severely with the potential to burn hence the proper storage
precautions.  People must have seen this in chem lab, or when you tossed
that liberated chunk the size of a baseball in a neighbors pool in high
school, blowing all the water clean out.  Oh not really of course.
&lt;smile&gt;

Actually I've always wondered about the no machining bit and exactly
how big the pocket in the head is, you must risk breaking into it.
Perhaps you can ignite it by spark as well hence the concern, though
certainly the heat is no major concern considering the function in the
engine.  Perhaps its the fact grinding machines may use a water
emulsified oil coolant.  Who knows though I do mention that merely
cutting into them is not likely to kill you as the manual itself I
believe recs disposal of sodium filled valves BY cutting in half and
dumping into a pail of water, or at least the manuals used to, but in
this litigious age who knows.
