I did something similar to what Michael describes, but I used a $3.00 red
funnel that has a handle and a half-dozen screw-on adapters to change the
size of the neck. I slipped a clean piece of garden hose onto this and into
the filler hole. Neat thing was that the handle allowed me to &quot;hook&quot; the
funnel into the channel at the top of the bus, freeing my hands and allowing
me to watch the filler hole more closely.
