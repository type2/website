Subject: Re: [T2] Weird engine meltdown... Attn: Bob MacD and Jake Raby

Hi Jim,

It doesn't sound like anything you did wrong... it's more a problem 
with the driving style. Not surprising... an auto tranny Vanagon feels 
like a much more modern vehicle than it is. But if you don't go easy on 
long hauls with heavy loads, the engine is bound to overheat.

I would recommend a CHT gauge. This will make the driver aware of the 
impact the load and driving style are having on the engine.

Happy trails,
