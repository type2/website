Subject: BN4 Heater in Colorado Springs

Hi Folks,
I just bought a '78 VW Camper - in the back of the
camper, in a box is a BN4 Gas heater with a bazillion
parts. To the untrained eye it looks complete and in
great shape. 
Anyone know someone in the Colorado Springs area that
could install this thing for me? It sure would be nice
to have this thing pumping out some heat! Are they
safe to use as a heat source while sleeping (camping)?
Al
