Karl, Pat et al:

Thanks for your replies!  Unfortunately, it looks as though I should have
been clearer: it is only connected below the air intake distributor (appears
to be connected to the firewall - I can only feel around; can't see!) The
other end is the one I can see - flopping about - and it is this end that
has three prongs within a dust boot.

As far as the FI idea goes... I should have noted that my engine runs fine
(when warm), but takes a good block of running before the idle is high
enough to prevent dying.  If it was the FI ground, she wouldn't run at all,
would she? (Unless some smartypants lost the ground, attached a new one -
and I've found the old one!)

Thanks again - and keep 'em comin'.
