Subject: Re: Heat: Gas vs. Propane

&gt;My understanding was that gas heaters were best for operating while driving,
&gt;but not necessarily for while camping, due to potential exhaust buildup.  

I think the main problem with running the gas heater with the ignition off
is the current draw of the combustion air blower motor (I'm familiar with
the early model BN4, not sure if this applies to the BA6).  With the engine
off and the heater running, battery voltage quickly decreases, the motor's
rpms decrease and the fuel/air mixture goes out of spec. causing the heater
to smoke and run poorly.  The gasoline heater produces great heat and runs
well with the engine on, though.

&gt;BTW, my Westy doesn't have a propane tank now.  I assume a tank would have
&gt;to be added to the OUTSIDE of the van for safety.  Wouldn't be safe inside,
&gt;would it?

My busboys catalog lists new oem propane tanks for $275-$300, I believe.
You could also try Euro-American for an oem tank, they probably have them a
little cheaper.  I seem to remember West Marine having a small torpedo
shaped tank with mounting brackets for marine use--maybe another possibility
for under bus tank mounting.
