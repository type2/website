Subject: Air in Lower Brake Resivore

Well I installed the new master cylinder on the 68 bus.  However I think I
screwed something up - I havent been able to completely get the lower
resivore to fill completely up.  The chamber for the front brakes has about
1/2 inch of air in it.  Any suggestions for getting the rest of the air out.
The upper chamber will stay full of fluid but the lower will still have air.
The brake pedal has resistance when pressed a couple inches down but keeps
going down until there it is about 2/3 of the way to the floor then stops.
Is this a symptom of air still being trapped in the line also.

TYIA
Mike
