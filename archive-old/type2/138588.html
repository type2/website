Subject: RE: [T2] Mid-Atlantic VW in Disputanta VA (near Petersburg)

      You know, I bought a car from him around a year ago as well.  At the 
time he said he was closing down, and since then I have not been able to get 
in touch with him.  If you do get in touch with him and he's still wheeling 
and dealing please let me know as well :-)
