Subject: Got 'em!

Y'all will be more than pleased to know that I've finally got all the
cylinders off my engine. (The heads slipped off just like they were supposed
to.)

One of them came off with minor encouragement (half a can of Liquid Wrench
and beating the life out of it with a rubber hammer and a 3/4&quot; piece of
Rebar), one with not-so-minor encouragement (half a can of Liquid Wrench and
beating the life out of it with a 2-lb one-hand sledge hammer and the same
piece of Rebar--wedge one end of the piece of Rebar against the bottom tin
and beat on the other end) and two weren't playing that game.

I used the rubber hammer. No go.

I used the little sledge. No go.

I used Erich, the 12-lb sledge I originally bought to help knock down the
Berlin Wall. He didn't work either.

Hang on...I've got an angle grinder! And these jugs are clear of the case,
just hung up on the rings! I ground a groove in the two remaining jugs
(after knocking away the cooling fins with the 2-lb sledge), stuck in a big
screwdriver, and gave it a little tap with Erich. It popped the cylinder
walls right away from the rings and off slid the jugs.

The pistons came off the rods easily, and here's what I'm currently up
against:

The case looks like it's in good shape externally--I haven't split it yet,
but the externals are good.

I put the flywheel face down on a big hunk of plate glass I got from work
when we had a front window replaced, then slid feeler gauges between the
flywheel and the glass. As far as I can tell, it's flat, but I'm going to
have it surfaced anyway just to be sure. Now's the time to do that kind of
stuff.

The crank and rods will be replaced whether they need it or not--it's hard
to do a stroker engine with stock crank and rods.

I'm going to replace the pushrod tubes, but for me that's proforma when
rebuilding a VW engine. I just wish someone sold chromoly ones.

The pushrods themselves are nice and straight, and you can blow air through
them. Into the cleaning box with them.

The heads look like they've been sitting in a parking lot for five years,
mainly because they have. Three-angle valve job, new guides and sodium-
filled valves, it'll be.

The fuel pump doesn't work. I know it doesn't work because the electric fuel
pump and fuel pressure regulator are already installed.

As for the body, which is coming together nicely, there was a pushed-in area
that is accessible from the engine bay. One morning I was looking at it
before I went to work, and I thought, &quot;I wonder if that will come out just
by pushing on it?&quot; It did.
