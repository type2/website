Subject: Roof replacement?

Hi list-

I have a 73 panel that has some rust at the drip rails and has had a 
vent added in the middle of the roof.  There are also some other 
poorly completed repairs in various locations near the roof vent.

I also have a 73 donor bus that has what appears to be a very nice roof.

Has anybody ever transplanted roofs?  How does the roof come off the 
sides of the bus (other than with a sawzall?  Is the drip rail a 
separate part?  Does this sound too hard?

My other choice would be to spot repair the drip rail, and graft in a 
section of  the good roof in the damaged areas.  My concern about 
that was that welding on the roof area would be pretty hard to do 
without warping it.

Ideas?  Thanks in advance for any input.
