Hey Jamie,
Just a thought about getting a wb02.  If you just want to monitor your 
AFR, then you can find yourself a narrowband o2 sensor (like the one on 
aircooled_dot_net which I have and like), you can purchase a wideband o2 
(which is expensive) so you'll have an idea what your AFR is, or you can 
convert to a system that will actually control your AFR (like the 
megasquirt) utilizing a cheap NB 02.  In addition, it will also pass smog ;)

I first tried the NB02 sensor and it hopped all over the place and 
really didn't give me anything to work on.  That's in part to the the 
nature of a NB02 and the fact that the stock EFI on the bus is all over 
the place.  Then I got myself a MegaSquirt which integrated nicely with 
my existing AFR meter and NB02 and I can actually see the computer 
holding the AFR around stoich for cruising, or above and below stoich 
for accel/decel respectively.

Unless you have money to spend, I'd hold out on the WBO2 and wait until 
the MegaSquirt II/Ultra Megasquirt has full support for a WB02 and then 
get it.  It's nice to have a readout of your AFR, but it's even nicer to 
be able to control it as the stock EFI leaves a bit to be desired...
