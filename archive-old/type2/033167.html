Subject: Re: JBwelds*cks need oil filler tube

Funny, I've found JB Weld to work just fine when used properly.The hole I 
plugged in my fan housing a year ago is still holding up. I remember a listee 
some time back also saying the stuff was crap- a friend of his used it to 
patch a hole in an engine block and the repair failed some 5000 miles later. 
HMMM, I don't know, but that sounds pretty good to me. If the failure had 
occured in the middle of nowhere, I'd have thought he would be extremely 
pleased with getting 5K out of it! Beats the hell out of getting towed.
