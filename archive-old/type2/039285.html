Subject: Re: Looking at purchasing 1971:  Question on Body Work Costs

i have to agree with steve, my bus will never win an
award, not the rustiest bus around, but she sure aint
straight:)   body work youre talking about is gonna be
steep in price, thousands to do right, so if its nice
body you want....head west i say!   otherwise sit in
the drivers seat, soak up the busma, and if its right,
you'll know what to do.

&gt; &gt; Any guesses appreciated.  Trying to decide if I
&gt; want to tackle this one.
&gt; well, my bus had most of that damage.  Fewer dents,
&gt; but more rust in teh
&gt; rockers.
&gt; 
&gt; I have yet to fix any of it really, and have enjoyed
&gt; the bus and driven it
&gt; a LOT.
&gt; 
&gt; so, what do you really want out of a bus... Bodywork
&gt; if you dont do it
&gt; yourself is expensive.  If you enjoy that sort of
&gt; thing a dented bus is a
&gt; challenge, and fun.  But if you dont like bodywork
&gt; it will be a chore.
&gt; 
&gt; If you like the bus and if feels right, tackle it as
&gt; time allows.  If you
&gt; just dont like it, wait and a better one will come
&gt; along eventually
&gt; (patience grasshopper, hehe)
&gt; 
&gt; take care,
&gt;
