Subject: lots of continuing FARTING
Message-ID: &lt;944f4bcf.247f61bb_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

STOP with the oil farts.  Please for the love of god.  

If I tell you I use synthetic and have never changed my oil in LESS than 
20-25,000 miles would you run out and buy my brand??   Not likely.

If I give you 100 facts about my brand of oil, and how my visco. is the best 
choice, will you go out and change your oil to my kind??   Again...not likely.

Is there some way we can point some of the new people...(of which I was to 
blame for these same farts, when I first got on..) to a web site or url??  
What ever happened to the weekly posting of type 2 pages??  We used to get a 
weekly list of the library page, archive, etc.  or is it just me who's not 
receiving these anymore??

Sure there are some of you who are going to challenge this by saying, that 
with all this conversation on these farts, (oil,tires) then we are helping 
those who want to learn.  I do not wish to be a speed bump on our type 2 vw 
learning highway we have constructed, but please lets come up with a 
solution.  

Possibly the admin. could post a message (public ) to them for all others to 
see, telling them kindly, that a lot of info can be found in the archives 
etc.  If after looking there they ( we, I ) have a SPECIFIC question then 
please ask for help.  lord knows there's an abundance of people on here who 
love to give out opinions.  ( me included)...:-P

* whoosh...(throws water on flames).......
