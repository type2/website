The guys at Buslab told me that I should expect higher engine temps 
during break-in, and if you think about it, it kind of makes sense... 
Things are really tight in those cylinders during this time (so tight 
that you have very groovy looking oil at your 300mi oil change :-)

Now, I also have a question... is it normal for vacuum to be lower 
during this break-in period?  The rings have not fully seated to make a 
good seal in the cylinders, so I would expect this would be the case... 
but I would like to confirm it nonetheless :-)
