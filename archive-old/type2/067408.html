Subject: RE: Bus ancestry - the dymaxion car?

Let me see if I can be the first of many to respond, albeit briefly.  A
VW distributor named Ben Pon got the inspiration from a mule that the
factory had made from a beetle pan.  The mule had (I think) steering links
extended to a steering wheel at the rear, and the whole front was a 
platform for schlepping engines around.  Pon saw all that space, and
drew a famous little side-view that looks JUST like the 50s VW buses.
The rest is history, unless you work for Chrysler in which case it is
just a silly story.

Did others hear it the same way?
