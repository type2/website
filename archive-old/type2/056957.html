VW Friends,

I jost got a 1973 VW Van. I beleive it is a &quot;Campmobile&quot;. It has a bed,
sink, side seat, A/C, Etc. I am trying to find out what was originally
in it interior wise. It has a wheel well in the back, but also had a
tire holder on the front! Which I think was added. It rusted the front a
little. Anyway, just wondering. The engine is not original either, so I
am trying to figure out what should be in it!

Thanks,
Nate
