Subject: Re: [T2] head (gasket) question

You definitely need these. Without them the head/cylinder will definitely
leak, with old ones they will probably leak, with new ones they won't leak
provided your head and cylinder are healthy.
Bow Wow parts in Victoria BC is where I,ve always bought them.
Maybe posting an update on what you have tried/found so far would help the
list help you.
Sounds like the head may have been loose, causing the leak.
How did you find the leak? Compression test?

&gt; volks
&gt;
&gt;     I have been having the problem with the 2liter engine in my 78 auto
&gt; tranny, someone suggested a leaky head so last week I swapped out a head.
&gt;
&gt; today I took some time to look it over real good....only thing I could
&gt; really find was some material missing beside the head seat on #4 but no
&gt; hole, in #3 which is where the leak was.....there was some evidence of
&gt; leakage from the cyl... sort of a blackened area fanning out from a spot
&gt; on the head/cyl interface...no damage noticable on the head, didn't see
&gt; any on the Cyl or piston when swapping.
&gt;   looking real real close it appeared that the thin metal gasket between
&gt; the cyl and head may have been leaking.
&gt; .  is this gasket needed
&gt; .  where can I get em
&gt; .  don't you change the compression ratio if you remove em.
&gt; .  what about if you have em on one side but you remove em from the other
&gt;
&gt; all I have are used ones and they are getting old..?????
&gt;
&gt; O great and wise list....inspiration and guidance needed here
&gt;
&gt; thanks
