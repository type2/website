Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Topic What I learned about driving in Snow!

Sounds a lot like my week driving to and from work in snow and freezing rain
the past few days. Don't know if you guys got the freezing rain up in
Seattle but if you think snow freezes fast on the windshield try that stuff.
There's nothing I could do except look out four little holes about four
inches round and get out and scrape the glass every couple miles. I even
have decent heat but not at 18 degrees. I'm glad I don't live to far from
work. Other than that I was very impressed with where I could go with six
inches of snow on the ground and one inch of ice on the top of that. That
was without chains. With the chains on I think the bus did better than my
Jeep CJ7 in 4wd. It was fun to watch some of the looks on guys faces in
their big 4wd's as I easily cruised right past them. If I could just avoid
the aching back from crouching down lookin out those small clear spots on
the glass.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; It's been a colder Winter than the last few since I
&gt; bought my first Bus 3 years ago.  I bravely decided to
&gt; try my hand at ski instuction this year in the
&gt; Mountains near Seattle. At 2000 feet they aren't the
&gt; Rockies but the snow is heavy and wet.  My first time
&gt; was good: Sunny sky's and fun. The Bus handles GREAT
&gt; ON snow. But I soon discovered DO NOT drive an
&gt; unheated (noheat will survive getting to that cab in
&gt; 20?F.) Bus IN a snow storm. I headed up to the pass
&gt; one morning and the snow not only hit my windshield
&gt; but began to freeze and stick to it! Not good. Sheet
&gt; ice was forming. Yikes!
&gt; Yes, VW type 2's are great on snow, but not in snow,
&gt; that is if you like seeing out the front window!!!
