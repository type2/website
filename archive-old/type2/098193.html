Subject: Removing carpet glue ??

Hey All,

Owner before last of my 71 had glued shag carpet over
the entire interior of by bus encluding engine
compartment. The guy I bought it from had pulled out
all the carpet leaving quite a ugly sight of carpet
glue with shreds of carpet. 

Does anyone know the best way to get rid of this mess?

Thanx
Bradford
