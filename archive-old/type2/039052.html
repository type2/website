Subject: Re: Bus Tires

&gt; &gt; PS My tire guys happily swapped out the light truck tyres he installed 
&gt;for
&gt; &gt; some C rated cooper tires, he has not installed them yet, but I 
&gt;appreciate all of the advice.
&gt;
&gt;What is the max load in lbs. marked on the side of these Cooper tires?

ha...you won't believe it, the Coopers arrived with 2&quot; knobbies.

I ended up picking up some 185R14 Yokohama's from the Tire Rack 
(tirerack_dot_com) for $49 each &quot;C&quot; rated, 1,600lbs, 50psi Max. $230 delivered. 
They had a &quot;D&quot; tire for only $4 more and rated for 1,800lbs but I figured 
that was overkill.

Thanks for all the advice!
