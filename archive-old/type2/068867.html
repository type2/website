Subject: tire carrier

I have posted this before, but was unable to find anything out.  I am looking
(patiently?)  for a front mounted tire carrier that fits into the existing
holes on a 75 bus.  Anyone with one like this care to let me know the vendor
from whom they purchased theirs?  I would very much like to get a hold of one
of these.

thanks..
dave
