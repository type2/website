Subject: Re: [T2] The bastard booster drum [WAS: What VWs other than the
  Type2 came with power brakes??]

G, et al,

Here at BD:

http://www.busdepot_dot_com/view.jsp?model=57&amp;category=5&amp;group=56&amp;prodgroup=466

Rant:

Busdepot's website still confounds me.  Does everyone know to click on the
&quot;See all Parts&quot; button?
I was blowing it on that for sometime, also, you have to use the back button
all the time, I don't like the navigation.

I can see some of the logic behind the way it's laid out, I just get tangled
up in it.

I'm ordering from BD now that I'm east of the Mississippi, but I still look up
parts on the BusBoy's site because it's just plain simple.

&gt; Dang, I looked all over the &quot;Brake parts&quot; section on BD and didn't see
&gt; those. Never checked BB. I'll check the local FLAPS to see if anyone can
&gt; cross them. Otherwise I'll use the ones from the '74 and buy from BB to
&gt; replace those.
