Subject: what would grove the push rod

I just took the #1 exhaust push rod from an engine, I was told was recently  
rebuilt and found it has a grove about 10 mm wide and 2 mm deep about 2.5 cm  
from the lifter end.
 
I will be pulling the push rod tube and the lifter tomorrow but was  hoping  
someone might have seen this before and could send me in the  right direction.
