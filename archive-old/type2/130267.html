Subject: Nokian tires....

We just purchased a second transporter and it needed a new set of
tires.  I know this is a bit of a hot topic but I wanted to share what
I found for others in case they had not come across them.  What I
ended up going with was the Nokian Hakkapeliitta CS.  These are
specifically designed for winter weather and rain.  The rubber is hard
enough though that they can be used year round if desired.  I have not
had a chance to check them out in the snow as Denver has not gotten
cold enough but I have experienced them in the rain and I am quite
impressed.  I went with the 195R14.  These are not cheap by any means
but the reviews speak for themselves.

Enjoy,
