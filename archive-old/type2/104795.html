I've done a lot of business with the Warshawski Company (dba JC Whitney)
over the years.  Sometimes you get top quality stuff (s/a West Coast Metric)
at rock bottom prices.  Other times you get absolute [low quality items]!
I got points and condenser for my bug once--they were the crappiest set of
points I'd ever laid eyes on--I don' know where they got the [temerity] to send
that [low quality item].  When the condenser died a couple of weeks later,
I put back in the old, used, Bosch set, until I could get my hands on another
genuine Bosch set.

The biggest problem, I've found, is that half the stuff on your order fails
to materialize..............ever.  Calls only connect you with high school
kids with accents as thick as wheel bearing grease, and room temperature
IQs.

I've found that dealing with folks like Wolfsburg Warehouse, Bus Depot,
and Aircooled_dot_net just make life a whole lot easier.

&gt;I plan on rebuilding the suspension in my BUS.

Aside from shock absorbers, what parts of the suspension do you plan
on rebuilding?
