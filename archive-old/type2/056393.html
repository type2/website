Subject: New engine, now I need EGR filter...

Today I am the proud but very broke owner of a NEW 2-liter engine!
One catch: my warranty doesn't take effect until I add an EGR filter to my
1978 camper.
It has the EGR valve, and the dummy light that chirps on every 15K or so,
but it's never had the filter. I guess it runs from the muffler up to the
valve????
Anyway, I have no clue where to find one. Course, it doesn't help that my
RockyMtn Motorworks and other catalogs are boxed up for our big move to
Idaho in four days...
I hear they run roughly $130 apiece. After paying nearly three grand for
the powerplant (that term really applies now! power!), I'm not fazed by
another hundred bucks. Just need to know where to go.

Thanks in advance, and BTW, it was a Tom Noble engine.
Known a number of people who've used him, and none have had to call the
warranty to task.
A good sign, but methinks I need the filter just in case.
