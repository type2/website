&gt; I know this is probably a stupid question, but since it is Friday.... I have
&gt; one of the engine analyzers that look like a multimeter but have an RPM/dwell

&gt; metal probes. Where can I put the hot probe to get an rpm reading?

Hook them to the two low voltage connections on the coil.  If the reading
is erratic, reverse the connections.
