Subject: SOT: Corvair trans?

Anyone know of a good used corvair trans?

VW bus content:  a nice fellow in Marietta just blew the corvair trans in
his VW beetlevair.  exploded the differential.  I know some of you bus guys
will know where to get one for cheap.  I visited this guy yesterday to get
part of a wiring harness and alternator for a Full Moon Bus Club driver who
just had a wire fire.  He just cut up a '78 bus and is working on a funky
'71 with a pinto engine.  he has a lot of sheet metal parts and good front
beam from the '78 (it was badly wrecked a while back and posted to thesamba
a few months ago). also has a nice 40 horse split bus in his basement.

We also fixed the rear track roller on my sliding door, the spacer that
holds the door open had gone AWOL and the door was falling down about a cm.
works like butter again now!

please pmail me if you have any leads on the corvair trans.
