&lt;&lt;  Hi I looked at the Pic &amp; was wondering why won't it
also fit on later vanagons? I have an 81 &amp; wonder if
it will work on my rear hatch.
Also do you have any pics of the rack with bicks
mounted on the rack?
Mike &gt;&gt;

Mike,
Yes, we offer similar racks that fit the Vanagon.  The Vanagon rack will hold 
up to 3 bikes, but comes equipped to hold 2.

Yes, I have a pic somewhere with bikes on my '74 Westy.  If I can't find it 
quickly, I'll take a pic tomorrow.
