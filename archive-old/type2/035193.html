Subject: RE:Reliablity,jeeps not welcome

Away, Satan!  Jeeps break their engine mounts when they go over a
pothole, I'm
for real here.  You know this if you have a cherokee.  I've got nothing
against
the original willies and their beautiful 40's-50's versions, but what
you have
is
nothing but a AMC mail delivery vehicle with a nice advertising campaign
behind
it.  And since you don't seem like the sensitive type, I'll have to be
blunt.
Find a jeep list and go there and don't come back until you understand
the
meaning of life.  Oh, and you'll have to change that email account
name.  I'm
suprised we don't filter for this sort of thing!

recommend one
