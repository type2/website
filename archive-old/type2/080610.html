Subject: RE: [T2] stainless exaust for upright

&gt; I know its been discussed before but I couldn't dig up any useful
&gt; info, anyone know where I can get a stock style stainless exaust
&gt; for a 1600?


I will have a Stainless Steel Muffler at a very cheap price. Unfortunately,
though, not until around the spring. The muffler is South African made and
fits '68-71. (The tailpipe sits a bit too high to clear the apron on a
pre-68.)  It looks very close to stock.  I have sold later model stainless
mufflers from the same manufacturer, so I know that the quality is good.  In
fact, some of the ones advertised in Europe for much more money are in fact
these same mufflers, repackaged under other names.  The only bad news is
that the tail/damper pipe is not stainless, so it may not last as long as
the muffler, but I will try to keep some of them in stock separately as
replacements in case you need one.  The price will be right around $99
complete (including the tail/damper pipe).

For those whose busses can't wait until Spring for a new muffler, I do have
in stock genuine German made Ernst exhaust systems for '63-71.  These kits
come complete with all pipes, hardware, etc., and while not stainless, are
excellent quality.  Price is $95 with listmember discount.
