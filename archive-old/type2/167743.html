&gt; I know this has been discussed before, but I'm looking for engine options
&gt; for my '71 Westie.  Right now, the choices are:
&gt;
&gt; 1600 DP
&gt; 1776
&gt; 1914
&gt; 1918
&gt;
&gt; (I would also consider a Porsche 914.)
&gt;
&gt; My requirements are simple:  reliability and &quot;adequate&quot; power.

You could also consider a 1679 (88mm machine-in jugs).

I think that in general, the farther you get away from stock (1600), the
more hassle you're going to have,  be that getting the proper carb jetting
or just getting the idle right.

OTOH, there are lots of people on this list who run big engines and have
no problems.  I think those folks (in general) have a lot more experience
tinkering and/or fussing with these engines and/or are willing ot tinker
and fuss more.  Having to tinker (in my mind) removes the &quot;reliable&quot;
aspect that you are looking for...

So, I would suggest going with a 1600DP (or 1600SP) for the best
reliability.  I have heard good things about 1679's by the folks who have
built them but silghtly less good things about 1776s (although I'm sure
ther are lots of volks out there who haven't had any problems).

I find that these engines (1600s) generally have all the power I need when
set up properly.  The real enemy is &quot;Heat&quot; and keeping your engine cool.
I'm generally pulling over to let my engine cool down more than I'm
worried about whether I have to downshift on a long grade.  Along these
lines, I think you'll find that the higher displacement engines will
generate more heat than a stock 1600 and will (again) result in more of a
headache in the long run.

That's my take at least.  I've driven some heavy loads very long distances
in buses and 3rd gear has yet to disappoint me.

Cheers,
