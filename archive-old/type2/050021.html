Hi,

We have a 009 dizzy, put on by the PO.  
The stumble is very noticeable, complicating the issue.  :-(

&gt; 
&gt; Assuming you have what I think is the correct distributor for the year 
&gt; of your bus, this would be a dual (vac &amp; centrifugal) advance 
&gt; distributor, with a dual diaphragm vacuum can (advance and retard).  
&gt; It's possible that your vacuum can is bad and/or the breaker points 
&gt; mounting plate in the dizzy is sticking.  Also, a bad vacuum retard hose 
&gt; could be at fault.  My 71 has the same (or similar) dizzy  (on a 1600 dp 
&gt; engine), and a bad vacuum can was the cause for a similar problem I was 
&gt; having.  I replaced the can, and the engine behaved nicely after that.
