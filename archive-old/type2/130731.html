&gt; My vacuum brake booster went out on my '71 Westy a while back and I

You can, but start buying &quot;baggy style&quot; jeans, because you're going to 
develop big right quadriceps pressing that brake pedal so hard.

Myself, I prefer to have a more balanced leg work-out[*].  So if I were 
you, I would most certainly have my brake booster rebuilt :-)

[*] .._dot_come to think of it... Summer League is coming up, and a 
stronger right leg could really help my swing... &quot;hmmmm......&quot; :-)
