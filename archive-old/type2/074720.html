Subject: 71 beam to 68

List,
I found a lot of information about axle beams in the archives.

What i didn't find was a definitive answer to the question:
Will a beam from a 1971 bus swap straight to a 1968 bus with no mods(some=
one
please say yes and mean it!);p

I'm talkin' bout the whole thing - all the way out to the rotors.
I know that i should use the 71 master cylinder and a manifold from a 71
engine.  I'm just wondering if she'll bolt up.

thanks,
clark
