Subject: Re: [T2] Should caliper bleed screw leak?

Bill,

I sure hope that this is normal; I too noticed it happening when I bled my
brakes for the first time the other day.  Well.. not the *copious* amounts
that you describe, but there definitely was some fluid seeping out through the
threads.  It seemed to be worst when the bleeder was unscrewed further than
necessary -- Bentley specifies a half-turn, but if I recall correctly, a
quarter-turn was actually more than sufficient.  Since my brakes don't leak
when it's screwed back in, I figured that it was probably normal behavior.

Cheers,

- Miles
