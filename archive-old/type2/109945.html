Subject: Re: [T2] New AC Twist

Good point Karl--

I see your awake pretty early this morning--

That's why I made sure you guys also had the phne number--so you could
prevaricate with is guy--he didn't seem to answer that question I had
for him--whats in it ???

Yep--I saw that monetary figure on the web site too----
But as we speak--directly in front of me, I have the ad---$1.99 each.

Go figure--

Pick up a current Hemmings Motor News--
This stuff is up front in the colored section--$69.99 a case

Later,


Terry

[T2] New AC Twist 
No where on the 6 pages of fluff does he list ingrediants but I will bet
you it is a blend with over 50% of it being propane! And the website
says $2.99 a can.... 
Maxi Fridge--Natural Organic Refrigerant 
$1.99 per can--
