Subject: here's what i did today

Hi all,
Stephen White was up here once again this weekend.  We had a hoot.  We
went and finished off the 63 I found in a junkyard near here...WAS
complete...now only has trans and locked up motor... took us 5
hours..not bad.
it was the *rustiest* bus I have ever seen.  We figured out why today
upon pulling all the crap from inside..including barbed wire ...ouch!
there was a decomposed 50lb bag of rock salt on the floor!!!!
wow...brains to whoever put it in there!

I pulled the jack point/part of the floor/outrigger/crossmember off with
a little tug of my HAND! I threw it up and Stephen shattered it with a
breaker bar.  wow...we fall through the floors...
I was wondering why the rust dust tasted funny when the wind blew..now I
know why..salt!

anyways...here's what we all got for $50...I'm sure I'll forget some
things though

all front braking equiptment
half of the back brakes (going back to get the rest)
shift extender
brake resevoir plate for the floor
Sapphire 1 radio in perfect shape and the knobs and push
    buttons work! and are there!  ivory
shifter
horn button
15&quot; rim - Stephen already got the other 3..now I only need one more for
a set!

windshield
all latches/knobs/handles
hub cap
some air vent things
screws/bolts
front floor mat - kinda rough
belly pan
headlight assemblies
ignition switch
lenses
lights
wires
wiper motor and linkage
other plates and other dinky little stuff

great deal as far as I'm concerned..all off of a 63 too...gotta love
those brake parts...

and those nut covers that go over the nuts on the front axles...make
great ashtrays! well...the passengers side one does...the drivers has a
hole in it for the speedo cable..which I also yoinked.

cool eh?

well..adios all

anyone have a spare wiring harness lying around that they would like to
get rid of that would fit a 63? if not...I'm going to order one soon...
