Subject: Re: [T2] BN4 Heater Repair

Wow, what can I say but thanks!!  I'm glad you were able to put the info to
work, not just sit it on your shelf.  Thanks again, I'm honored.

&gt; Hello All,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been working on my BN4 which works intermittently.  I used the EXTREMELY
&gt; helpful &quot;Early BN4 Repair&quot; page by Ron Van Ness to thoroughly check my heater
&gt; and have performed nearly all the tests and checks he lists on his page.  I've
&gt; also used the Eberspaecher manual and video that Rick Taylor made available
&gt; after he put on the heater workshop about a year ago in Kansas.  I've narrowed
&gt; the problem down to my fuel pump and pressure regulator.  I need to replace
&gt; the diaphragms in both these; I'm unable to locate a source locally for the
&gt; 1/64&quot; (0.016&quot;) thick petroleum resistant, rubberized cloth/nylon thread
&gt; reinforced diaphragm material he used in his procedure (I've gotten some
&gt; strange looks when I explain what I'm looking for around here...).  The best I
&gt; can find on the internet is 0.5 mm (0.020&quot;) thick buna-N sheet rubber at
&gt; McMaster-Carr; most other places I checked can only get it in 1/32&quot; (0.031&quot;)
&gt; thickness.  Does anybody know of a good source for about a square foot of the
&gt; appropriate material?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again to Ron and Rick for making such great information available to
&gt; all of us on the list.  I really appreciate it!  It's people like you who not
&gt; only have the technical ability to meticulously fix this stuff, but the
&gt; patience to document it and put it in a format the rest of us can easily use
&gt; that make it possible for all of us to keep 30+ year old vehicles safely on
&gt; the road.  You guys are great!
