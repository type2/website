&gt; Are you sure??  I've adjusted the play out of steering boxes on both
a '79
&gt; and '74 within the past year.  Screw/locknut design was on both of
them.
&gt; I'm certainly no expert on model year/design changes, but it took
the play
&gt; out of the wheel on both.  I can't remember for sure, but I think the
&gt; adjustment screw and locknut were located on the driver's side of the
&gt; steering box.

I was sure, but I've been corrected.  There is an adjustment.

Sorry, George
