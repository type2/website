***
need technicals on Solex 34 pict-3 and H30/31 pict carbs.
anything would be useful.

simply do not have enough information.

especially the h30/31 pict.
it has a strange vaccume dealy that attaches to a levrarm next to the idle
arm. what is that thing? is it necessary.
why isn't it attached to the carb?
some freaky cracked out engineer fix... better double check that dosage.

'68 campmobile
'71 transporter.

looking for a killer deal on a steering box for '71
she'll be back on the road in no time at all...
