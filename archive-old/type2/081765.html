&gt; Jack up the spindle so the upper arm is off the rubber stop.  Remove the
&gt; clip holding the rubber stop on.  Lower the spindle.  Beat on the inside
of
&gt; the arm and it will be off in under 10 blows (using a 4lb hammer!).  Then
it
&gt; will slide right off.  Putting back on be sure the seal is properly
seated.
&gt; Don't mangle as all my research shows they are currently NLA.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck,
&gt; Bill

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, I forgot you didn't already know what is was thinking...  I
&gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; follow Bentley.  I wouldn't heat the trailing arm.  I would remove
the
&gt; arm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself (did a couple weeks ago).  I would try to remove it myself
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (unsuccessfully).  I would take it with the new joint to a place
that
&gt; knows
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what their doing.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bus Boys has rebuilt trailing arms for 175 plus 50 for the cores.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just a thought if you plan to do all 4. I dont know if theyll swap
them
&gt; &gt; &gt; individually.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm in the midst of this same process on my '70 and having recently
&gt; replaced ball joints on a Type 3 I thought I would have no problem.  Well,
&gt; the first thing I found is that the upper control arm setup is different
and
&gt; I can't figure out how to get it
&gt; &gt; out.  On the Type 3 all I had to do was take out a stop plate and the
&gt; whole thing rotated up in the torsion tube and the drop arms slipped right
&gt; out.  The Type 2 has tension against the rubber stops and I can't figure
how
&gt; the drop arms come off.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The second thing I found is that the same shop I took the Type 3 drop
arms
&gt; to claimed they could only replace the ball joints while the arms were
still
&gt; on the vehicle (by heating it up).  Having already been told by several
&gt; people that is not the case I
&gt; &gt; took my business elsewhere.  I turns out my local VW FLAPS has welded up
a
&gt; little jig specifically for the Type 2 ball joints.  As some of you have
&gt; found out, the Type 2 ball joint has a flange that goes all the way to the
&gt; edge of the control arm with the
&gt; &gt; exception of 2 notched areas so its hard to set it safely in the press.
&gt; The VW shop's jig lets the control arm sit in those 2 notches while the
&gt; press exerts pressure on the ball joint.  So today I will pick up my 2
lower
&gt; control arms with new ball joints
&gt; &gt; and only pay $30 labor for the pair instead of the $125 each that the
tire
&gt; store wanted to charge me for doing it on the vehicle.
