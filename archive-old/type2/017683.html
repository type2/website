Message-ID: &lt;3714edaf73 Dual Port*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Does anyone know off the top of their head, or have a quick and easy 
reference, to the
&gt;timing #'s for a '73 dual port engine?  (shhhh, quiet 
&gt;now, it's actually for a beatle:)  But shouldn't it be the same as a 
&gt;bus?

The engine code and distributor type are needed to determine this.
The code (two letters which precede the engine number on block) can be 
compared to the chart
in the 'Idiot Book' provided the distributor is stock. Find that out by 
comparing the distributor number
to the distributor tune up parts lists in the Rocky Mountain Catalog.
