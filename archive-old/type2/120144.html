Subject: Bus Music???

Well, when I think of music that I would listen to in my Bus, I think of like... 60s complain rock. I snagged a bunch of CDs from my parents many years ago when I was still in high school and living inside. 

One of them, I don't know what the groups name is.. but the song sounds like.. &quot;Sha la-la-la-la live for today!! lalala&quot;. Then &quot;California Dreaming&quot; by the Mammas and the Pas, grace slick with Jefferson Airplane, all of that other hippie stuff. Sounds great in a Bus!

Todd
