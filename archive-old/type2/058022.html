Subject: tightening head nuts, '78

No one answered my query on oil leak from engine/cylinder connection in my
78 Westy.  So I went ahead and retorqued the lower head nuts while doing
the seal work.  Stopped it on one side, other side still leaqks a bit.
Anyone know if this is worse than leaving it alone or know if the upper
nuts can be reached?  Would holes have to be cut in the tin?
