Subject: Gas Leak!
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

This morning I filled the tank of my 75 and noticed a couple of drops of gas
under the bus.  When I looked under it appears to be coming from the inside
the wheel well, I also got a strong gas smell when driving.

The smell went away and I did not have any more leakage.  Is there a rubber
hose or boot between the filler and tank that needs replacing?  I have looked
in the Bentley book but am unable to find anything but a fill pipe and the
tank.

Thanks in advance for the help.
