Subject: Getting my new bus

I'm finally going to get my new bus. It's a '71 Westy, white in color,
complete with all the trimmings. Mark Dearing of Salem Imports rebuilt the
engine for me as I bought the bus in Salem and it had a blown engine. I must
say the Mark has done a fine job of putting up with the constant changes I
made as I read Bob Hoover's sermons. &quot; Make sure the Hoover bit is  there,
balance everything, make sure of this and make sure of that, etc. Mark even
sent the fan pulley to be balanced. Anyway, I pick it up on the 14th of Jan.

I think this is one of the best Christmas presents I could get. I have been
busless since I sold Beary, my '75, and I went through a bad 'cold turkey'
withdrawal. I can't wait to get the new one.

I want to send a special Merry Christmas to all the wives of the listees. It
seems that we all wish each other merry tidings but leave out the &quot;other
half or SO&quot; They put up with so much. For example, if my bus develops a
malady I am a person possessed until I find the answer and I get&quot;...is that
ALL you think about&quot; So to each of our wives or SO's a very happy holiday
and thanks for putting up with us.

To the rest of the list, may your travels be safe and uninterrupted and may
God grant us a year of peace and good will. God bless us everyone. TBear
