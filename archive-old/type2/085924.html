Subject: Re: [T2] Acceptable speeds


I have a '70 T-porter w/ a SP 1600(built reliably by Pozzi's in Sacto)
that'll do 50-55 comfortably in 3rd gear(on level ground), and 70-75 in 4th 
gear.  I have swapped out the stock tranny for another from a '79, and it 
made the vehicle much more reliable for freeway driving.
