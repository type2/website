Subject: vanagon windows/failure notice

Hi, this is Billy,

The vanagon windows won't fit, too tall, and the qmail-send program at pon.type_dot_com is totally annoying. I typically pare my messages down to relevant content, and still get bounced.

Admins, what's going on with this?

Hi. This is the qmail-send program at pon.type2_dot_com.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses. This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.
