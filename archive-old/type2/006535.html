Subject: '74 carbs onto '72 bus question
Date: Fri, 12 Feb 1999 16:19:15 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Fellow Busser's,

    After battling a chronic *gas leaking into the crankcase* problem, I've
decided to swap carbs from my '74 parts bus onto my '72.   When removing the
carbs from my '74, I found spacers between the carbs and intake manifolds
that are about 1/4 inch think.  My '72 has never had these, as far as I
know.  Anybody know why these are there and wether they should be moved with
the carbs or not?
    Question #2 - The carbs I took off the '72 were missing the fuel-cutoff
switches, but the carbs from the '74 has them.  Would having these in place
stop fuel from siphoning through the carb into the crankcase?  I'm thinking
maybe I can just put the switches in my already set-up, but leaking, carbs
and solve the problem?

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!
