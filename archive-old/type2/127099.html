Subject: RE: [T2] Overheating? How can you tell?

The old school technique is to feel the dipstick handle. If it's scorching hot to the touch, then the engine's running too hot.
 
These are  my experiences with a FI 2.0L Westy with oil temp a gauge:
 
Oil temps have always been good (&lt;= 220) in climates &lt; 85 *F. In warmer temps, I can cruise at 60 all day  and climb short hills. Extended hill climbs (&gt; 5 minutes) tend to overheat. You can also overheat by driving into a strong headwind, beacuse the engine makes more power and heat to overcome the headwind. If yoo have to climb for a while in a warm climate, stop and let the engine cool for 20 minutes every 5 minutes or so.
 
I don't have 1600 experience, but I understand they are more prone to heating up.
 
Rick
