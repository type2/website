Subject: Re: [T2] RE: T2 tune up question

Richard,

Had that problem with my socket too...I grabbed my favorite stuff(3m 
weatherstrip glue) and just glued it back in...I don't think it
has ever come back out with a spark plug again.

Shameless plug for yellow weatherstrip adhesive!  LOL

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt;Just be sure whatever wrench you use, that the rubber gasket inside
&gt; &gt;the socket holds the sparkplug securely...Otherwise, it's magnet-on-
&gt; &gt;a-stick time to fish it out of the cooling fins...;-(
&gt; 
&gt; I've had back luck with spark plug sockets. My preferred tool vendor was changing manufacturers and as a result their spark plug socket became unavailable. I bought a crasftsman spark plug socket and I found that the rubber inside gripped the plug to much and the socket stayed with the plug when I tried to pull it out. I eventually found a better fitting regular socket and put the rubber piece inside and tailored it to my needs. With the engine tin in place the 6-sided top that most spark plug sockets have doesn't really come use anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; The hose technique is a good trick but I still don't like dealing with plug #2 on a FI bus.
