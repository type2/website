Subject: Re: [T2] Going back to dual Solex's

&gt;I have been thinking of converting my single Weber Progressive back to a 
&gt;dual
&gt;Solex 34 pdsit. Any thoughts?
&gt;
&gt;I am doing the same thing. I hate my weber progressive.
Single webber progessive, yes. Dual is another story.

Accutally if you want to sell a single progressive let me know, I am going 
to do the unthinkable and put a turbo into my bug. Was getting 13.8 secs at 
the quarter mile, I want faster. Oh yeah 1960 VW bug, one year only color, 
little rust, happy car.
