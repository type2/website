Subject: RE: Coil-over rear shocks

Does anyone remembers the electric VW busses that were bought by a few of
the listees several years ago?  I bought one (have since sold it), but these
busses were part of an electric vehicle program.  Each bus was built a
little differently in the way the batteries and motors and whatever, were
installed.  Anyway, these busses were built by VW of Germany, in the VW
factory, and ALL of them had coil over-shocks.  These busses did not see any
&quot;real&quot; service (but they did a LOT of loops on an oval track).  The coil
over shocks were needed due to the extream weight of the batteries and
motor/controllers.  I don't know how the shocks would have held up under
&quot;normal&quot; driving conditions, but thay did keep the rear ends off the road.

&gt; &gt;broke their shock mounts; those are NOT very good odds.

&gt; How true, Sami. Need more data before any conclusions can be drawn. One
&gt; thing fer sur, coil overs are not DM. It is an experiment until enough
&gt; data
&gt; shows good function and reliability without harm.
