I ordered a new set of rotors for my 91 Vanagon early Monday morning. 
They were on my doorstep early this morning. I emailed them some 
questions on Monday and received two email messages and a phone call 
from them on Monday.

I never remember this kind of service from one East Coast supplier.

Thanks,  Volkscafe!  You have my business.

Tnx
Steve
