I have a 1979 Westy with a FI 2.0 liter and automatic tranny. The motor
idles and runs great. When I accelerate slowly the motor feels like its
holding back. Almost like I'm driving with my foot on the brake. No misfires
or stalling. It feels like the engine is slightly hesitating and slightly
surging. If I drive with a heavy foot it doesn't happen...only when I'm
accelerating slowly. The timing is dead on and everything else seems to be
in order. Any and all suggestions on this would be greatly appreciated!
