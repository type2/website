Subject: RE: [T2] How to find TDC to verify Distributor is not 180 
  degrees off?

This is incorrect information.


&quot;&quot;So, even though the distributor only goes in ONE way, you have TWO
chances per cycle to put it in. And you simply chose wrong. It's a 50/50
guess. If you think it's in 180 off, you just take off the distributor,
turn your engine untill the timing mark leaves zero, and comes BACK
around to zero, and re-seat the distributor.&quot;&quot;


The distributor only goes in ONE WAY regardless of the engine turning.
Look at the drive dog at the bottom. It is offset. It only fits in the
drive gear one way.

Now the distributor drive gear could be installed wrong.

The easiest way to sort it out is just to move the spark plug wires around
the cap.
