Subject: Re: [T2] Belly Pan Question

&gt; No I was talking about the Middle between Front and Rear Tires. I did not
&gt; even look at the front to see if there was one there. Most of the time I
&gt; have looked or worked on this bus has been the AssEnd. Should there be one
&gt; on the front? I will have to check it out when I get home.

&lt;Michael, AFAIK all bay buses had the front pan to keep dirt and such from
getting to pedals and linkages.  Also helps to keep out cold air.

The other one which is from front tires to back tires, was discussed in the
past on the list.  Best anyone could come up with is, most sunroof buses if
not all had this pan as well as some other models.

Hope this helps,
Snoopy
