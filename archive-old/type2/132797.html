Subject: RE: [T2] Stranded in Southern Utah. Need a helping diagnosis.

Did you notice your tranny making any irregular noises prior to dying?

Does reverse still work?

If 1&amp;3 are bad, it might have something to do with the shifter linkage not
moving enough to properly engage those gears.

You can at least hope it's linkage related ($) and not the transmission
itself ($$$$)

 cannot change gears
(manual) from 2nd to 3rd. The only gears I can use now are 2 and 4. I had to
have the '80 Vanagon towed to a Texaco station because no other mechanics
were
