Subject: RE: [T2] Looking for windshield wiper part...

Rick,

The wiper shaft and therefore wiper arms are '68 only then '69-'72 and
finally '73-'79. The '68 are almost impossible to find. The '69-'72 are
available used and the '73-'79 are available new and used, all from us. Also
keep in mind that all the shafts are interchangeable. You can put the later
model shafts and then wiper arm on any wiper rack. It's a big job to pull
them but then when it rains it pores.

Can't believe I overlooked that detail. Been a long day... the bus is a '72,
and the wiper arms on it are '78s. I don't think there's a difference in
these years; they worked fine until I broke them.

&gt;WHAT YEAR IS YOUR BUS??????
&gt;
&gt; &gt; As I mentioned a while back, the passenger side wiper shaft broke while
&gt;I
&gt; &gt; was (over-)tightening the bolt. Well, I'm set to replace the broken
&gt;shaft
&gt; &gt; now. Does anybody know the part number/where I can get one?
