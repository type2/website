&gt;Greetings,
&gt; 
&gt;I am curious if there is a way to rebuild or repair an EGR valve.  I
&gt;have done several tests and apparently mine is not working properly. If
&gt;it is not possible to fix one can someone please give me a suggestion on
&gt;where I might buy one?  

This is what the mechanical version of the valve looks like in pieces:

The valve can be found at junkyards for $5-$10 in as is condition, in fact I saw one with a slghtly bent lever at the South San Jose pick-n-pull last week. It was on a 77 CA engine sitting behind the bus.

I've heard that &lt;http://www.smogparts_dot_com/&gt; may have these rebuilt but they won't be cheap because they know you're coming to them as a last resort. Search the archives for prices.

I found ithe exploded egr diagram on that site a while back (it shows the nicest example of a stock engine I've ever seen). It's like a time trip to the dealer in 1978:
