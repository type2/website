Subject: oil changes, vanagon

&gt;How often?  I say 5,000 miles is reasonable (a modern Toyota
&gt;supposedly needs oil change at 7,000 miles or so) but it seems some
&gt;believe every 1,500 or so is necessary or the engine will be at risk,

I (personally) have always changed my oil between 2,500-3,500 
miles.  The filter media usually becomes clogged by this time 
(even in my 2 N*ssans)and it's just more wear on the engine 
to have a bunch of unfiltered oil floating around bypassing 
the filter.  I never understood the 7,000 mile toyota oil 
change reccomendation.  I've seen oil in a Toyota after 7,000
and I sure as hell wouldn't want that crap in my engine!  I
believe that the longer oil change is the only way Toyota has
devised to kill their engines.  With regular oil changes and 
maintenance, a Toy motor can go 3-500,000 before a rebuild!
(Blasphemy here, I know... but it's da truth!)
I can see those Toyota engineers' brains churning right now..

P.S.--- On my T1 powered bus, it's every 2,000- no filter, 
right? I'm not takin' any chances.
