Subject: Re: Help! '76 FI problems

My 76 Westy has been sitting in my mechanics driveway for a year with the 
same problem. It ran fine until he pulled the engine for an overhaul at 
130k miles. After putting it back together, it would fire up and run on the 
cold start for 8 seconds, backfire, and stop.  It would do this as many 
times as required, but never switched over to normal running mode.

We swapped out most of the same things as Dave in our efforts to get past 
this condition.

We are as stumped as you are, Dave. Whoever finds the answer to this one 
gets the Westy Oscar.

Sorry about copying the whole post from Dave, but the value of his 
information is enormous to those of us who have been standing in his shoes 
for a long time, holding the receipt for a first class motor overhaul and 
being unable to attend all those great rallies and campouts and road trips. 
The dream is fading fast.

I need a fuel injection guru! Okay, here's the scenario. One day I
needed to go into town so I hopped into my '76 westy and fired her up.
Bummer,  not enough gas to go where I needed so I took my '78 ASI
instead. Two days later I go to fire up the '76 again and it just fires
for a second then dies. Okay, I check the usual e.g.: spark, spark
intensity, points, cap, rotor, condenser, voltages and resistance
values, fuel pressure (with a gauge too), fuel filter, fuel pump
operation, loose vacuum lines and loose grounds. Every thing checks ok.
Next I start swapping in new (or operational) parts like another air
box, fuel double relay, ballast resister, coil, ECM, main harness
(albeit from a '78), head temp sender, double check voltage at the ECM
and check voltage at the injector connects (12.3 V) during crank. Still
nothing. Next I pulled two injectors out (still hooked up) and cranked.
No fuel sprayed from the exposed injectors. The cold start injector will
still fire the engine momentarily, but it won't run.
Brothers (and Sisters) please help! The bus isn't as fun stuck in the
driveway! Thanks in advance.
