Subject: Re: [T2] weber carb set up

&gt;to gather up all the parts.  I'd like to get this bus rolling under it's own
&gt;power soon.   What type of fuel pump are being used, the electric fuel pump
&gt;is also gone, can I use a universal electric fuel pump?  If anyone has info

You should tend to avoid the universal &quot;Facet&quot; style square block
pumps, they don't last, and don't pull much agains gravity not that
that is much of an issue on this application.  Autozone around me
sells a nice little round style pump that lasts and costs $30 or so.
Get the 2-4 psi version.
