Subject: Bus spotting

There is a single cab bus for sale on the corner of Metropolitan and 4th 
street here in Leavenworth, Kansas.  I don't know what color it is or what year it 
is.  Anyone want a single cab?

Also, I have a 1968 Bay without engine, that is free to a good home.  Its a 
Westfalia.  Its in my garage and very towable.  It has a damaged top(somone 
threw a tire on the roof during the summer) but it has all the guts except for 
the sink.  Call me if you are interested Monday thru Friday 913 757-1027
