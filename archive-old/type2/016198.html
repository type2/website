Hey Volks,

I returned last night from one of the most gratifying bus trips I have ever
taken.  My wife Cara, 15 month old daughter Olivia, and I packed into Kermit
our green 1976 Westy Deluxe and left last Tuesday.  We towed a small trailer
with bikes, a kayak, and beach supplies and had a great time.  The trip was
about 1,850 miles roundtrip and the bus performed like a champ.  I was
especially pleased since I rebuilt the engine myself, converted back to fuel
injection, and performed countless other mechanical improvements.  The
trailer weighed approximately 500 lbs and pulled smooth as silk.  We drove
around 60 MPH all the way and got about 18-19 MPG with the automatic
transmission bus and trailer.  We stayed in the Gulf state campground in
Gulf Shores, Alabama and ventured over to the Florida panhandle for a little
beach cruising on Thursday.  We originally planned to camp in the panhandle,
but the Gulf state park and camground was just too good to leave.  We road
bikes back and forth to the beach and towed Olivia and beach supplies in a
child's bike trailer.  Olivia traveled like a pro and we all slept like
rocks at night after long days soaking up sun and tropical drinks.  The
saddest part of the trip was the lack of busses or Vanagons we saw.  Saw a
nice early bay Westy in Jackson, Mississippi which was the only bus we saw
on the road during the entire trip.  Saw two 69 Westys, a 71 Westy, and a 73
Westy parked in Gulf Shores, but that was it.  Only saw three Vanagons which
were all on the road.  Thanks for all the folks who responded to my post a
couple of weeks ago and offered advice and help.  This is a great list.
Take care.

Randall

PS- Up next is Colorado for some whitewater kayaking next month.  Stay
tuned.
