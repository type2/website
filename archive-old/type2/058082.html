Sorry to waste the bandwidth, but I'm packing up here
and I can't find my flourescent green brochure with the
directions for BBTA.  Does someone have the pamphlet on
their website?  I'm coming from Indiana on 70.
TIA...
See you there!

I don't have the brochure, but I just came from there.  Take 70 West through
St. Louis, past St. Charles, and look for the hwy 79 exit.  This is the first
O'fallon exit.  Take 79 north 5 miles to Cherokee Lakes Campground on the
right.

There are already at least 20 buses there.

BTW, bring lots of mosquito repellent.
