Subject: RE: Donations

&gt; Hello Ron    You are welcomed. Now let me ask have you if you have 
&gt; done anything to suport the Type 2 list,  any donations as I see that 
&gt; Tedebare just posted saying the list needs money, and I feel that
there
&gt;  are a bunch of vendors posting and wondered if they are supporting us
in return


Actually I saw Ted's post too, and was already planning on Paypalling
(is that a word? :-)  a donation.
