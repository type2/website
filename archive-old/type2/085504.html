Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Mexican hatch seal

Would this apply to the seals that GoWesty sells?  They are labelled as
German in their online vatalog.

&gt; I would seriously doubt that this is really a German VW seal, but it may
&gt; well be genuine VW.  For a number of years, VW has been selling Brazilian
&gt; made seals, even in Germany itself.  I have seen them sold, and even
&gt; labeled, as &quot;made in Germany&quot;, but they are in fact not.  I think one
&gt; importer may have bought some in Germany and erroneously assumed that they
&gt; were German made, not realizing that they were simply VW/Brazil seals
&gt; exported to Germany.  They are, however, closer to original than Mexican
&gt; aftermarket seal, despite where they're made.  In fact they are exactly as
&gt; you describe above: correct corners, etc., close to original quality but not
&gt; quite. They are the ones used on the Mexican and Brazilian busses.  I list
&gt; them as &quot;genuine VW&quot; but do not claim them to be German because I know
&gt; better.  There is also an actual German made seal available in Europe, which
&gt; I import from time to time.  This one is apparantly made by the one-time OEM
&gt; supplier to VW but is not a &quot;genuine VW&quot; seal (since the &quot;genuine&quot; ones are
&gt; in fact no longer German).  I have seen no significant difference in quality
&gt; between these and the Brazilian made genuine VW ones, and often I do
&gt; substitute one for the other based on availability.  I have not seen these
&gt; ones anywhere else in the U.S., at least so far; most of what I've seen
&gt; elsewhere are either aftermarket Mexican seals or the aforementioned
&gt; errantly labeled &quot;German VW&quot; ones.
