&gt;My main concern here is ensuring: a) that the head that  comes back is

&gt;change in ownership at GEX and their reputation problems), I am reluctant to
&gt;take up GEX's offer. GEX claims to now follow a procedure similar to MS in
&gt;rebuilding heads. GEX also failed to respond to any of the three e-mail
&gt;messages that I sent out three days ago.

I installed a type IV GEX engine for a fellow last year and it lost all
four exhaust seats within 1100 miles.  GEX was very good about honoring
their warranty but wasn't worth the hassle.  The replacement heads are
still working well but I now lack confidence in their products.  Not a good
thing.

I've not hear bad about Mark Stevens, just rave reviews.
