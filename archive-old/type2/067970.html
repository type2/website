Subject: Re: Busses as off-road vehicles

On road, you mean people actually drive busses ON the road.  I have 
traveled in all sorts of places, some were even considered roads, in 
various busses.  They were MADE for that kind of travel.  I have 
logged thousands of miles off road.  As for pushing limits, I have 
gone DOWN roads that NOWAY I would have been able to go UP.
(hoping that there was a way out at the bottom of the valley)
I have gone over things that have so severely twisted the body that 
the interior rear cabinetry on my '80 Westi has a diagonal crack in it.
The Splits have higher clearance than Loafs.  The ability to go off road 
and go camping anywhere is WHY we have a Westi.
Did a lot of kayak shuttle trips in my '64 on some really awful *roads*.
Camped *way* off road in our '76, and traveled all over AriDzona in 
the desert and mountains in our '80.
I rolled our '76  1 1/4 times. Righted it, put a tire back on the rim and 
drove 2000 miles home.
Never had to be towed from the boonies, but have had to make lots of 
repairs.  Take lots of tools and spares.

&gt; How are busses as off road vehicles?  I have no real plans to do any
&gt; offroading but would like to know what to watch out for if I do.
&gt; Anyone ever push the limits of their bus (mine is a '77 westy) in the
&gt; great outdoors?
