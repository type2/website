Oh God---
An oiler in line would create the most pocked up finish you could ever
imagine---

It would be fish eye city---supreme--

How the paint remained on the vehicle at all is a mystery to me---

Cool move Stan--

Kinda funny thinking back to when I was just learning this stuff----

Worked at Ole Uncle Earls--&quot; In at 9 out by 5 &quot; back in 66--67--what a
joke that place was--many fish eyes there--believe me--

Just for the sake of bring Murphy's Law into this discussion, I want to
lay this story on you. 
The first car I painted (without help) was a 1956 Mercedes 190 SL
Convertible. 
I did a meticulous sanding and prep job and when I was ready to shoot
the car, John Saracusa, the Cadillac dealer let me use his dealership
spray booth. 
I washed the car outside before I drove into the spray booth, I drove
the car in after I wet the floor down and I wiped the car down with tack
cloth to get it very dust free. 
This was going to be my premo project for 1962 and every stick of
chrome, every door / hood / trunk gasket and even the windshield and
hood &amp; trunk lid had been removed to get the perfect results. One thing
went wrong; I was using synthetic enamel and my friend John plugged the
compressed air supply hose into an air supply that had a line oiler on
it full of Marvel Mystery oil. 
I knew there were two air supplies, one with a series of dryers on the
line and the other with line oiler for impact tools. I just never
considered that John could not know this. 
John didn't catch this and I had a very nice looking flat finish on my
car that never dried. 
I didn't go back and rave at John, I just waited about six months and
sanded it down with lacquer thinner and had another go at it with clean
dry air supply. 
If prep is everything then running off the visitors is the next most
important thing.
