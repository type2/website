Subject: Door panels

i have two vinyl-covered door panels from my '71 bus. i don't know if
they're original, but they're in decent shape. i put in custom wood panels,
and these are just taking up space in my apartment. so, if you want them,
they're free, pickup in Boston only. they're too awkward to ship.

the backing board on the passenger's side is fine, but the driver's side is
split on the upper half. this makes for a weird seam in the vinyl, but i
think it could be easily fixed by reinforcing the backing board from behind
at that point. also, both panels have cutouts for 5 1/4&quot; [i think] speakers.

email me if you're interested and we can arrange a pickup time.
