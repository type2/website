&gt;I have a '77 van the engine of which I am rebuilding.  I have gotten the
&gt;heads on, and would like to add the lifters, but I have these awful long
&gt;'much bent wires' that go in under the lifters -- somehow.  I recall
&gt;trying to understand how they came out as I dissassembled, but wasn't
&gt;really able to see what they were doing.  what do they do, and can anyone
&gt;take a stab at explaning their routing?  What about their purpose in life?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
