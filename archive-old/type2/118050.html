Subject: Fuel Injection Jump

I jumped each of my fuel injectors directly from the battery to see if they 
had a nice atomizing spray, and if they worked at all.  I got a continuous 
atomizing spray, and I was wondering if it should be an alternating spray (on - 
off - on - off) rather than a continuous spray.  Also, is there anything else I 
should be looking for to determine the condition of my injectors.
