Subject: manual engine into auto tranny bus?'s

hey folks, i might be picking up a 73 adventurewagen with a blown engine,
still there but seized up.  i have a 72 4 speed westy hi roof conversion
currently but if i can get this bus i was planning on taking my engine and
putting it in the 73 and parting out my 72 as the 73 is in much better
condition and has the full adventurwagen package which is too cool to pass
up.  my main question is do i need to swap anything out in order to put my
72 engine in the 73 being that the trannies are different or is it just a
simple swap and run???
