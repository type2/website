Subject: RE: Westy Green Plaid

I'm not paying enough attention...

If anyone still needs it, I have plaid fabric out of a 78 (green) and a 75
(blue) camper. Condition is good to real good (no tears, stains or holes).
The only problem is one of the zippers on the green plaid disintegrated on
me the other day... For both colors I have everything except the front
seats, which weren't in either bus. Will sell by the piece or a cheaper for
all of a color. I'm in south eastern Virginia - 23456.

john
