hey folks....

okay here's the scoop..... I was driving my '78 standard one day with my dad
practicing the art of mastering stick (I'm only 17) and all of a sudden the
bus started vibrating and shaking while in the middle of fourth gear (was
going about 40) since then, every time I shift, a low, rumbling noise comes
from the back (I checked to see if I shifted too early but but that didn't
seem to be the problem.. or at least I don't think) My dad told me to take it
home..... the next day (today) when I got home from school, I started it and
the engine turned over, but sounded very bad, then I shifted into first, gave
a little gas, and slooooooooooooly let up the clutch..... the whole friggin
bus shot foward and back and then the engine cut..... I am compelety
confused.... I gave it some gas (I didn't know how much I had in it since I
have no Gas gauge) and the same thing happened.... If someone can help me out,
I've been stressing over this all day and I'm worried about this little
car..... If anyone can help me out with my trouble I will be very
grateful......

thanks alot
