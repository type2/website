I'm not sure exactly what kind of bus it is, all I know is it's a 
transporter.   It needs a paint job, and the interior needs to be totally 
replaced.  I also know that mechanically, it needs a new engine, 
transmission, the carbs need to be adjusted, and it needs new brakes.  I 
picked it up for $500.00.  I plan on having it shipped to Minnesota, which is 
where we're from, and fixing it out at my sister in law's place.  I'd like to 
do most of the work with my brothers and if my father in law wants to help, 
with him, too.  I know how to take the motor outand get to the generator, and 
I also know how to paint it, and put new seats and carpet in there.  It 
doesn't have a bed, But we want to put one in there, because we want to take 
it to the east coast someday.  The reason I want to do most of the work is 
because most of the mechanics would charge a lot.  One mechanic said it would 
cost $75 to adjust the carbs!  Then again another said that he wuold charge 
$90 to syncronize the carbs, and I know that isn't too hard.  Kevin says he 
wants to keep the bus orange, but I want to restore it to it's original 
color, of red.  I want to take the tire off the front and put a VW symbol on 
it instead.  What do you guys think?  I will take some pictures of it and 
scan them on our website as soon as we get them back.  Enjoy your days, and I 
look forward to your suggestions
