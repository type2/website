Subject: Re: Busses as off-road vehicles

&gt;Did a lot of kayak shuttle trips in my '64 on some really awful *roads*.
Ahhh, another boater!!!  Best shuttle/boating vehicle I've ever seen
these buses of ours!

I'll admit also to beating the heck out of my bus.  Amelia and I on
our first camping trip, went an hour up some godawful dirt path (road
wouldn't apply).  Bouncing in and out of deep ruts created by some big
monstertruck-type wheels.  Kept it in 1st and prayed that I wouldn't
have to stop (afraid I'd never get started again!)  But made it to the
most beautiful camping spot.  Coming back out later we got some amazed
looks from some good-ole boys in a BIG truck getting ready to head up
the same path:)

ahh the memories, time to go make some more.
