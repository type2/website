Subject: RE: Vacuum gauge

Ted and All;

I don't have a vacuum gauge on our Campmobile, but know what you mean as I've 
used them for years on &quot;lesser&quot; vehicles.  That gauge will really affect how 
you think about your driving style, etc.

Is your gauge plumbed with flexible tubing all the way to the front, or did 
you use rigid tubing for that long run?
