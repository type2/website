&gt; If it does not say C it can still have the correct load rating. If you have modern tires they can say something like 195/75-14R94. Here the last two digits (94) are the load rating.

&gt; I am not sure about the 92 Toyos mentioned in the original post.

Well, those tire rating schemes seem to change on a yearly basis, but the
one number that really says it all is the &quot;MAX LOAD&quot; number.  If it's
1540lb or larger you're in business, according to my owner's manual.

The other numbers (92, load range, etc.) seem to vary with tire size.  For
example, a 195/75R14 in load range C has less load carrying capacity than
a 185R14 _standard_ load tire!
