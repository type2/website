Subject: Re: [T2] Drive it really far, it just might make it

&gt; About 1963 or 64 it met its demise, a telephone poll on a sharp turn on a
&gt; country road, and was hauled away the next day to a junkyard after
chalking
&gt; up 70,000+ miles in our care and who knows how many before.
&gt;
&gt; Two weeks letter a letter came. Someone even back then interested in these
&gt; things had tracked down this bus as being one of the first to enter the
U.S.
&gt; and was interested in making an offer for it.

Sad ending, but a great story. Well, it sure is funny how some things
happen, isn't it? Jan B
