Subject: Re: [T2] Roll Yer Own Fuel/Air Meter

Depends on the sensor.  Mine is 4 wire - 2 heater wires, 1 ground, 1 signal.

It will speed it's start up and probably help out with idle readings, 
but it still isn't quite as good as getting it nice and close to the 
cylinders.

&gt; I'm thinking about using a 3 wire O2 sensor to speed up the readings
&gt; (3 wire=heater, right?) I actually even have one in my parts stash

&gt; was getting (seemed flaky) but the new one did the same thing. Turned
&gt; out to be the distributor that I haven't replaced yet.
