Subject: old westy popup
Message-ID: &lt;377E97FD.A06BB9EE_at_mail.ripon.k12.wi_dot_us&gt;

hey..
I found a pop up westy in a junk yard that is in great condition...the
popup part anyways..
the rest of the bus is absolute cr*p...  I was wondering if I could fit
the popup from a 64-67 onto a 71 hardtop....  It is just the little
squarish one.  Is it worth the work?  Whats all involved?
Even the seals are good on the one i found so...
That or i might just snag it and keep it for  a while till I get stella
in really good shape...
hmmm?
