Subject: Re: [T2]Testing a alternator OFF the bus???????

Call around and find a shop that rebuilds alternators - every town has a  
couple. Ask what they charge (no pun) to test your's. Advance Auto (used  
to work there) has a machine that relies on pigtails to idiot proof their  
machine. When I worked there only a couple of us even knew what an  
alternator was supposed to do for a car, let alone how it worked. &lt;grin!&gt;

You might also call Napa or a Mom and Pop parts store (we have an ancient  
one with the same guys that have been selling parts for 50 years) and see  
if they have a tester. These stores typically have people who know  
something about cars and their parts.

See ya!

Chris
