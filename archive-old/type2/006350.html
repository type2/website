He handles lots of service manuals, owner's manuals, and sales literature
for early VWs.  His booth is always swamped with customers at the VW meets
in the Northwest, and his prices seem to be very fair and reasonable.

     Anyone know where I could get a good used owners manual for my 79 Std.
Bus.  Has to be complete with all pages readable.  I could get one new for
$30 bucks but thought I would check here first.  Thanks.
