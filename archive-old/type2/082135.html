Subject: carbs and a free tranny

List, 

I have a recently rebuilt 30pict-3 carb from a 70 bus that I dont need. I'd be glad to sell it or trade it for a 34 pict 3 carb that I need for my 71. 
By the way, I never had any takers on the 70 tranny I have sitting around. I'd be glad to swap it for a little VW mechanical knowhow. I need my master cylinder replaced and need a hand. I'll throw in some free bus glass too...how about a wiper motor...
Anyone, anyone??
: )
Thanks,
Melissa
