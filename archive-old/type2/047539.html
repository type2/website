Just my luck then. If I can't get the shop who installed it to replace it, 
I'll have you folks send me one. Funny, was gonna order it from y'all to 
begin with ( I've bought a ton of things from you folks, all perfect, and no 
problems with delivery, I might add...) but my buddy got one from a local 
dealer in about two hours, and as my wife was three days past her due date, 
and the Westy was/is our only transportation, I gave in and said yes. Never 
again. Unless, of course, Ron has a special three hour delivery service for 
expectant parents!
Thanks,
Robb
