With 227,000 mi on the 78 Westy, I have never replaced any wheel
bearings.   I bought the Westy with 60 K on it and remember having all
the bearings packed at 150K because of a round the country trip, but
thqat is it!  I've adjujsted the fronts (grease looked OK) and know
there is too much in-out play in the rear, but no noise yet!!


&gt; &gt;Rick:
&gt; &gt;Interesting that you should say something about the 30,000 mile service
&gt; interval on
&gt; &gt;the rears. I've never heard of it.
