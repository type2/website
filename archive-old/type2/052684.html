Subject: [T2] Piston ring question

T2ers,

My son and I are assembling an 1800 cc engine for the 75 Westy. We are at the 
point of installing the rings and have found that these rings (Kolbenschmidt 
pistons) do not match the drawings in any of the 4 books we have. The books 
show the top compression ring as having a rectangular cross section. The top 
ring on these has a chamfer on the inside surface of the ring. I expect that 
the chamfer goes up (there are no TOP markings on the rings) to allow an easy 
gas path behind the ring. However, this isn't the sort of thing I want to 
guess at, no matter how logical my guess is!!! BTW, the second compression 
ring has the outside setback to designate the bottom.

Would someone be so kind as to send me a direct email with the solution to 
this dilemma??? The assembly is held up at this point, and I don't want to 
wait for the digest to come through if at all possible.

TIA/Don Carron
