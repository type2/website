I can't imagine a rusty gas tank being good for anything.  Consider
replacing or repairing that.
Also, replace your fuel filter, it could be filled with the rust from your
tank.

The FI system works optimally only if all the hoses are inplace and in
shape.  That includes gas-lines, vaccuum hoses, breather hoses too.  My '75
used to stall out after about 10 seconds, it would run fine once I ran it
for awhile, and would generally only stall at idle speed.  I could usually
rev it to keep it going.  I looked around for a culprit, and noticed no
connection between the charcoal filter and a nipple on the air filter box.
I connected them up, and the problem stopped.

Consider replacing old hoses with proper fitting new hoses:  Gas line,
vaccuum and breathers.

If you haven't replaced that gas lines in the past few years, that  is
always a good idea, other wise, make sure you have a nice big fire
extinguisher.

Hello all,  I purchased a '76 bus (fuel injected) this summer, it sat for
many years.  In great shape but gas tank is rusted inside.  I change gas
filters often, every 60M.  For a few weeks now, when I attempt to warm the
engine or drive anywhere, the engine revs for perhaps ten seconds then
dies/sputters for ten seconds.  I'm assuming that my injectors are not dead
as it is revving and such.  I as well just replaced my gas pump.  I will be
taking engine out to clean but I'm wondering if this problem is something
else.  Thanks all.
