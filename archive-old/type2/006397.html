I'm running a Brazilian 30/31PICT on my recently rebuilt 1600SP, and have
accumulated ~14,000 miles on it with the jetting from the factory.

The tailpipe tells me it's running a bit rich, but the plugs look to be
right on the money mixture-wise.  I'm getting 20-21MPG on the highway,
cruising at 60-65MPH in a loaded '70 Campmobile.

This setup checks out at the low end of the Washington state specs for
emissions, as tested with a certified analyzer.

FWIW.....
