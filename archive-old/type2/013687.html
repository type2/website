Subject: Noise from Tranny

Hey Volks,

I recently pulled my engine for a number or reasons, one of which was
to replace the throw-out bearing.

Well, I replaced it with a brand spankin' new one, and I'm still hearing 
the
same noise, so I'm baffled.

Here's the situation:

'71 bus
pre-71 tranny (has the TO bearing that looks like: -0-  and the 
retaining clips that are separate from the TO bearing)

At idle:  clutch in, no sound
At speeds less than 10-20 mph:  clutch in, no discernible sound
At speeds above 20 mph:  clutch in results in high pitched whine sound 
that other VW Techs have confirmed
						(upon hearing it) sounds like the typical 
noise a TO bearing makes when going
						south

Have I somehow mis-installed my tranny or TO bearing?  I first started 
hearing this sound in my TO bearing
when I removed my previous TO to replace the tranny seal and then 
reinstalled it.  Is there a trick
to how the TO should sit when I pop the engine back in, or is something 
else mis-aligned fubar'd?

thanks,
	t
	71 hardtop camper
