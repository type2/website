Subject: Replacement screens for jalousie windows

I scanned the archive but I did not find much about the creens that fit
behind the jalousie windows.  My 73 came without screens and I am certain
that I will need them for next spring's camping.

Has anybody been successful in making replacements?  Are replacement
commercially available?  How would someone install them?

Thanks a bunch,

Mark
