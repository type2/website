Subject: Re: battery charging

&gt;I drive my 78 (type-IV, FI 2.0L) to work and back every day, a
&gt;whopping 3.5 miles each way.  For all you disgusted bicyclers on the
&gt;list, sue me, I'm lazy.  Anyway, this means I'm starting my bus twice
&gt;from cold every 7 miles.  Now that the weather's getting cold, the
&gt;battery is acting sluggish, no big surprise.
&gt;
&gt;Here's the question: What's the shortest distance I need to drive each
&gt;weekend to charge my battery for the coming week?

The answer:  0 miles.

3.5 miles is more than far enough to completely recharge your battery from
a start, unless you are cranking it for more than 10 seconds, or unless you
are running your headlights.  Even then I would think it would be okay.
Maybe your battery is just old?
