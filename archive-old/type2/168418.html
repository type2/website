Subject: Power assist brakes fixed.

Hello List,

Its been a while since I've been on this list. I'm glad to be back live
instead of just reading the archives.

I finally found some time to do some work to my bus today. I installed a
tach that I found in a donor bus, a somewhat poor quality tach but matched
the other gauges pretty good. It works alright. I'm gonna try to calibrate
it a little better with a good external tach soon. I also replaced some
bulbs and rewired all the lighting for my radio and add-on VDO gagues. The
dimmer works on everything now.... even the tach.

The door switches now work with the interior light for the first time in my
7 years of owership. The wire was disconnected on the passenger side and the
drivers one wasn't making ground contact...it was loose.

And I also hooked up the power brake booster. I replaced the unit 2 or 3
years ago, with the previous dual carb 1800cc engine and I opted to
disconnect it due to vacuum leaks. I bought some 1/2 heater hose and ran
that from the long metal pipe to the engine bay. I got a good one way check
valve from the bench... i had 3 and only one passed the &quot;blow through&quot; test.
I actually found the right tubes to connect the rubber &quot;T&quot; boot on the air
intake distribution box to the check valve. Clamped the whole thing up and
voila! power brakes. Holy crap I can't believe the difference. I forgot they
were supposed to be so good! I think there may still be some air leaks
though.... the engine was idling a bit slower than it was and was rough when
i reved it.... I might buy some more of that heater hose and bypass the
metal pipe. There was some rust on it. (where isn't there any?).

I took the bus camping last weekend for the first time in a year. It was
wonderful. I need to make more time to do that stuff. I'm glad I have all
the big ticket items fixed in the bus. I can finally work on the little
stuff while it is a usable camper.

Does anyone have a good source for an orange 3 window pop top canvas? I
found some material online:

http://www.fashionfabricsclub_dot_com/catalog_itemdetail.aspx?ItmID=U7154

not really sure if thats sufficient... or if I want to take on the task of
making my own. I was thinking of reusing the old screents, they are in good
shape. The canvas is all torn and weak. Has anyone made their own with good
success?

I am proficient with a sewing machine. Just not sure if it can handle
canvas.

keep on bussin'
