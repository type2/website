Subject: Re: [T2] New Bus

Depends on when the 76 was built..... if it was built before 12/75, it will
have an electric EGR valve, a 6 pin air flow meter [0 280 200 012], a 14 month
only FI engine wiring harness. 1/76 up is the same as 77/78.
79 makes a difference between Calif version and Fed version on a bunch of
things.
79 uses square exhaust ports on all.
79 Fed heater boxes are one year only.
The 76 to 78 engine has oval pipes between the heater boxes and flapper
valves. 79 [and 72 to 74] has round pipes.
Lots more things to list, but I think you get the idea.....

&gt; I just got a new to me, 1979 Bus.  Not much rust, doesn't run.
&gt;
&gt; Previous owner says it lost all its oil one day, he didn't know why.  One
&gt; thing, though, there is no seal around the engine.  If the engine overheats,
&gt; will it purge the oil somehow?  I can't see any holes in the engine, and the
&gt; bottom of it isn't any more oilyer(?) than my 76 which runs fine.
&gt;
&gt; How much different is anything on a 79 than a 76?
