Subject: Re: [T2] A Friday Busaru Story (spotop)

I was chatting with a shop owner here in Tucson who has just finished  
his Subey conversion on a water-cooled Vanagon (88 I think) and he  
fills his coolant system by first connecting the plumbing up to a  
vacuum pump and running the pump until the hoses are all crushed and  
all air has been evacuated.  He then allows the pressure differential  
between atmosphere and the coolant system to 'suck', so to speak, the  
coolant into the system.  The result, he says, is no air pockets and  
no bleeding necessary.

I can't say whether or not this would work as well on rigid tubing.   
I'd love to have that Subaru power in my bus though.  Man that  
Vanagon is FAST and STRONG.
