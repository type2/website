X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Joe,
Thanks for the info. Didn't respond right away because I was busy getting a
patent on the process.... just kidding. My lifters did pump up by driving
around. I am interested in your priming method. Couldn't find it in the
archives. Do you remember the subject title? I was a little confused about
the pill bottle. Is the lid on tight or just tight enough to create
pressure? Snap on , crew on lid? A friend showed me how to use a oil can
with a pump to prime them. I purchased a nice oil can with the w/ a hand
pump on the side. By putting the nozzle of the pump to the small hole (hold
it tight)  in the side of the lifter, pump 'till  oil comes out the top and
no more air bubbles can be seen. I'm not sure this is recommended but its
how I've primed them in the past and seems to do the job.

&gt; I didn't see a reply, so:
&gt;
&gt; I don't think you need to prime the lifters. They should pump up. HOWEVER,
&gt; if you do need to prime the lifters, and you'll know if they haven't
primed
&gt; by now, one nice little trick I learned is to use the hydraulic principle
&gt; to prime them.
&gt;
&gt; Get an old pill bottle about the same size as the lifters and a deep pan
of
&gt; oil. Put the lifter in the oil; then scoop it up (and into the pill
&gt; bottle). Cap the pill bottle when it's full of oil and both are in the pan
&gt; under the oil. It will be a tight fit to put the cap on because you'll
have
&gt; hydraulic pressure resisting. Once the lifter is securely in the pill
&gt; bottle, start pushing on the cap of the pill bottle and squeezing. You'll
&gt; see the bubbles come out. Keep doing this until all the bubbles escape.
&gt;
&gt; This is a much easier technique than others described in literature. I
&gt; discovered it on my own, so don't try to patent the process. I'll fight
you
&gt; in court and take your royalties. :)
&gt;
&gt; When I discovered this, I posted a more detailed message describing the
&gt; process. If you're interested, it's probably in the archives.
&gt;
&gt; Have fun! Joe

&gt; &gt;Q: Am I going to have to take out all the lifters and prime each one? Or
&gt; &gt;will they eventually pump up? I had it running for 3-5 minutes w/ no
sound
&gt; &gt;of getting quieter.
