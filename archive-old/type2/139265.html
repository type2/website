Subject: Show Westy on the Samba

Changing the subject:

This show Westy on the Samba has been bugging me, like waking up with 
the tune and lyrics of &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; or &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; can make 
you nuts:

First, I am convinced that no new Westy ever looked this good. The 
shine in the paint is too deep, and the tires are too black.

But looking for the silver lining in this cloud, I decided that the key 
to a show bus is to wash your windows. Look at those windows! When I 
get Peregrine running again, I'm going to be fanatical about washing 
the windows.
