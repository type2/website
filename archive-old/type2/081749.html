Subject: [T2] transmission failure , how common is this?


&gt;Ok , i pulled my busted transmission that kept me from camping at EB. As I
&gt;suspected , the long bracket that holds the Selector link had broken  . This
&gt;has happened before in another bus I owned, How common is this? I have a
&gt;bracket i can use from one of my spare trannies but i need to locate another
&gt;one so that my spare is still functional. Any one know where i can get one?
&gt;Would welding it back togeather be a viable option?

Common problem, caused by forcing the shifter to engage gears.
Simple repair, dealer part, $20. Welding is also possible and effective repair.
