I have looked at these things for years, and never found any real proof that
they work. But I have found one thing, They do not hurt anything either. So,
they may be a waste of money for no improvement, but they will not destroy
your engine or make the doors fall off.

The EPA did...and they found out the only thing it improved was the revenues
at the company that sold it to you.

I have heard of people putting cow magnets in their fuel tanks. (Cows ingest
lots of metal. You feed the cow magnet to Bossie, and it draws this metal to
itself, keeping your cow from cutting the heck out of her four stomachs.) On
a Bus you wouldn't be able to do it since it would get stuck in the filler
hose--maybe removing the sender and putting the cow magnet in through the
sender hole would work? Or attaching a couple of them to the bottom of the
tank and taping them up there for good measure? It's mostly a placebo
effect--yeah, I have a cow magnet in my gas tank, now I can stop bullets.
Maybe it would collect rust? In which case putting the cow magnet in might
not be a bad idea. 

Cow magnets are a whole lot cheaper than Fuel Masters, though, so for a
couple of bucks you too can have a cow magnet in your gas tank and stop
bullets yourself.
