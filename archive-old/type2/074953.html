Subject: Re: starting issues.... 

Check the alternator output voltage.  It has to be higher than the battery
voltage to charge (measure battery with key off-measure alternator output
with engine running, ideally a little bit above idle)

1) alternator voltage low

disconnect battery FIRST, before working on alternator.

First step is to check brushes (length-see manual).  If
brushes are short buy new brushes and replace the ones in your regulator.

If brushes look ok try another regulator-pick and pull has hundreds of
Bosch alternators in the euro car section, you should be able to find a
suitable regulator if you check the numbers.  If you get a sample to test
in your system you will find out if it is the regulator.  If the original
one is bad by all means get a new one at the FLAPS or your supplier of
choice.

Checking and replacing the diodes is a bit more advanced but still within
reach.  For a first timer It is probably cheaper to get a replacement from
pick and pull. If you get the unit apart for any reason at least inject
some new grease into the bearings (syringe needle past/through the seal)
even if you don't strip them and R(efurbish) OR R(eplace).  In my
experience replacing the brushes before they start arcing and relubing the
bearings before they dry out/rust will keep alternators going essentially
indefinitely.  45 minutes every ten years should do it.

2) alternator voltage good
 check wiring using manual

PS If anyone has a good online reference for decoding the &quot;Bosch type&quot;
all-in-one regulator part numbers would they please post it. There seem to
be a lot of regulator part numbers but only few basic sizes of
alternators. Thanks. jon
