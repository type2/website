Subject: Pulling a Vintage RV with a Bus

I have experience pulling a lightweight trailer with a 1967 VW bus. My
experience was that at only 660 pounds (empty) dead weight and less than 100lbs
tongue weight was fine but did have some effect on the bus. My particular
trailer was called an Eriba Puck, manufactured by the Hymer company back in
1967. Several variations in style and vintage can be found on the internet.
Also see a &quot;Burro&quot; as one similar variation but produced by another
manufacturer.

The engine in the bus that pulled our Puck was 1776cc with dual carbs and
included an extra capacity oil sump an external oil cooler. The transmission
had an extra metal strap to help hold it in place thereby reducing the stress
on shift couplers and tranny mounts. I have also pulled a &quot;Heilite&quot; collapsible
trailer with a Eurovan camper.

Personally, I would not advise pulling a Airstream Bambi, Shasta or similar
trailer with a (nearly) stock 1600cc based engine. Several friends have pulled
smaller collapsible &quot;tent trailers&quot;, an occassional teardrop or similar. One
fella that I know has pulled a Bambi with his modified (and lengthened) bus
which is driven by a Chevy V8. Otherwise, I'd use extreme caution. Pay
attention to the weight of the trailer vs. the weight of the vehicle.
