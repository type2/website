Agreed.  The type IV engine with no seal will have two places through which
to suck air into the fan - one is the vents, three *feet* away from the
fan, and the other is the large gap between the tin and the body, which is
3 *inches* away from the fan.  You don't have to be a brain surgeon to
figure out where the engine fan will be drawing most of it's cooling air
from.  Did I mention that the muffler is immediately below that gap?  In
fact, it's so close that VW had to install a thick metal heat shield to
keep the muffler from burning the engine seal.  I can't comment on the type
I setup, but on a type IV here in Texas, having no engine seal would be
very dangerous for the motor.  My oil temp runs about 130 degrees over the
outside air temperature with a sealed engine compartment.  If my engine
were drawing in the hot air from around the exhaust, it would definately
overheat.  I'll be keeping my engine seal in place.

I'll offer up this tidbit as well:  A wise automotive engineer once said,
&quot;Parts left out cost no money and cause no service problems&quot;.  If it was
okay to run without a seal, VW wouldn't have installed one.  Q.E.D.
