Scotch Plains woman found slain in Ark. 

08/29/00

Friday evening, Kristen Ann Laurite called her mother
in Scotch Plains from a highway rest stop in Arkansas
to let her know she was having problems with the 1971
Volkswagen van she was driving cross-country to San
Diego. 


The next day, the 25-year-old woman's two dogs led
lawmen to the banks of a secluded pond where her nude
body was found not far from the rest area along Route
40. Her throat had been slashed 10 times. 


Detective Cleve Keeling of the Conway County Sheriff's
Department said yesterday the area is so secluded that
had it not been for the two pets, Laurite's body might
not have been found for months. 


Arkansas State Police and the sheriff's department
said they have no leads or suspects and that there was
no evidence that Laurite was raped or robbed. 


&quot;The family is devastated,&quot; said her aunt, Renee
Frietat of San Diego, Calif., whom Laurite was driving
to visit. 


Police said the pond, which sits in the middle of a
hay field and is surrounded by woods, is being drained
with hopes of finding the murder weapon. 


Police said Laurite had stopped at the rest area near
Morrilton, Ark., about 50 miles northwest of Little
Rock, to phone her mother and friends. She told them
she would sleep for a few hours and then hit the road
again. She was traveling alone in the yellow van,
packed with her belongings and her two dogs. 


&quot;The poor girl thought she would be safer sleeping
during the day and driving at night,&quot; said Keeling. 


According to the detective, a truck driver and his
wife stopped at the rest area at about 5 p.m. on
Saturday. 


The couple noticed a collie dog wandering restlessly
in the 105-degree heat. Police said the trucker, whose
name was not released, was giving the dog water when
he noticed a telephone number inscribed on the dog's
collar. 


The phone number belonged to Lynne McCue, the victim's
mother. When the trucker called McCue, she told him
something was out of the ordinary and that her
daughter would never leave the dogs unattended, police
said. 


McCue described her daughter's van and pleaded with
the truck driver to look around. He noticed the van
parked at the end of the lot, walked over and spotted
the second dog, a German shepherd, sitting quietly by
the car. 


After calling out Laurite's name and getting no
response, the truck driver contacted the Arkansas
State Police and the sheriff's department in Conway
County. 


After three hours of searching the area, Keeling said
lawmen were ready to give up when they heard the two
dogs barking frantically. He said the animals were
found sitting by their owner's body. 


The medical examiner's office in Arkansas estimates
that Laurite was dead six to 12 hours before being
found, said Keeling. 


The truck driver yesterday was on his way to New
Jersey, bringing the two dogs to the victim's mother. 


Laurite, an only child, lived with her mother and
stepfather, Thomas McCue. Her father, Edward Laurite
of Morristown, traveled to Arkansas upon hearing the
news. 


Laurite's parents could not be reached for comment but
her grandfather, Joseph Laurite, described her as &quot;an
alert and smart little girl.&quot; 


He added that her family was worried about her
traveling alone across the country and tried to stop
her from going but she had insisted. 


Laurite graduated from Scotch Plains High School in
1993. She attended East Stroudsburg University in
Pennsylvania but left the school in December of 1994,
according to the university. 


For the past year and half, she worked as a plant
technician and decorator for Parker Green House Farm
and Garden Center in Scotch Plains. 


Colleagues describe her as a friendly, courteous and
hard-working girl. 


&quot;We are floored by this news and upset that this nice
girl, totally deserving of goodness, would get killed
in this terrible way,&quot; said Randall Miller, the
general manager of the store.
