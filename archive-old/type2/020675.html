&gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, these bushings do not have the 2 little oil holes like the
&gt; &gt; original ones. Can I get away with drilling them after they are
&gt; &gt; installed in the rods? Should I leave them as is?
&gt;
&gt; Neither alternative strikes me as &quot;A Good Thing&quot; (as Martha Stewart
&gt; might say.)  If the original bushings had these oil holes then I have
&gt; to think they're there for a reason and *not* having them could screw
&gt; things up.  Too, trying to drill these &quot;in place&quot; strikes me as an
&gt; impossible task and fraught with problems.
&gt;
&gt; If you're going to the time and expense of rebuilding an engine then
&gt; I'd say &quot;Don't guess.&quot;  If I were you I'd press those suckers out and
&gt; then go and get the correct bushings.
&gt;

Tom and Tom:
Those ARE the right bushings, in all likelihood. Yes, you need to drill the
holes.
And, yes, you need to finish the bushings to the right clearance. There is no
way that manufacturers could finish them to the right clearance because they
are an interference fit, that is, the bushing OD is greater than the rod's
ID, that's what holds it in. Normal procedure is to have an automotive
machine shop with a Sunnen rod hone and the correct mandrel hone them to
finished size. They need your pins too.
There is some other company that makes a machine to control the finished
LENGTH of the rod and that would be desirable. Find out who does the rods for
the drag racing Chevys in your town. They can handle it. While the rods are
there, they should check the big end for roundness and size, first actually.
Recondition them if necessary. Then balance them, big ends and small ends.
They use a hanging rig with 3 rollers to suspend the big end over the gram
scale and then switch it around and balance the small end. If the rods are
the only thing you balance, you'll be most of the way there! If the shop you
call doesn't know what you're talking about, find another. It's not rocket
science (but it IS rocket tolerance!)
