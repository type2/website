Depends on how loud you play it.  :)  Hopefully not loud enough to be heard
outside of your bus when you're near other people (forgive me, I'm one of
those quiet-loving campers).

Get yourself a digital voltmeter and monitor the battery voltage.  When it
gets down to 12.1 volts, it's time to remove the load.  You can take the
voltage lower but the farther you let it go down the more damage you will
do to the battery in the form of decreased capacity in the future.  You can
get a cheapo digital meter for about $20 if you look around (hint - not at
Radio Shack).  Analog gauges won't cut it for monitoring batteries.

If you only use the battery for powering a stereo (and you don't play it
really loud) you should be able to get at least 10 hours out of it.  If you
want to start the bus with the same battery, I would shut it off after 3-4
hours max (or when it gets down to 12.4 volts).
