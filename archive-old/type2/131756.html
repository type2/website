Subject: Re: [T2] I'm getting the busloops

&gt;From: &quot;Chris M.&quot; Heck for all the time I spent thinking about my Corvair 
&gt;implant, I could have whittled a new Type IV engine out of aluminum AND 
&gt;added an extra 2 cylinders. Spent WAY too much time pondering that project. 
&gt;Was pretty easy in the end.

&gt;Yeah those stock-folks got it easy. Take it apart, clean it, paint it, 
&gt;replace the gasket/seal/bushing/bearing and put it back together. &lt;grin!&gt;


Try this one:

Electric bus, I know it has been done successfully before. I like it, I love 
it, I want more of it.

But throw this one in there as the power source

Now we are talking loopy beyond the envelope.
