Hey all it's me again,

I timed my engine and that fixed the throttle problems I was having. I
actually got it on the road, but am now experiencing power loss, and got
stuck about 1/2 mile from my house with a dead battery. I hadn't charged it
before I left, but the alternator is supposed to charge the battery while
the engine's running, right?  So the alternator is suspect. BUT, I still
have a wire or 2 to ask about. I have a black round 3-prong connector that
goes through the firewall up by the throttle body, and a fat red one coming
from the generator (which I connected to the solenoid, but I'm not sure if
that's right.

I also have a flat black &quot;connector&quot; hanging under my dashboard. It has 7
wires pushed on the back of it. Could this be why my left taillight
cluster/turn signals/emergency flashers don't work??

Thanks again to all those who have helped and to all those who will,
