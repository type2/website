Subject: RE: Heater Blower needed

Don't know if you want to go this route but it does work well. I scanned the
junk yards and found a 87 (I think) Toy*ta Celica with a very good blower
motor. I built an adpater plate out of aluminium and screwed it into the fan
and original fan housing. I made an arbor adapter for the squirrel cage fan.
I never blew so much air before. Not for the timid or those who can't stand
to have non VW parts, but well worth the effort if staying warm is your bag.

79 Transporter, MSHP Stage I, AT, FI and now For Sale... (sob!)


&gt;So now I am in the market for purchasing a new or rebuilt heater
&gt;blower.  Does anyone know where I can get one?  I'll buy a used one from
&gt;someone if need be, but would prefer to try for a new one that I won't
&gt;have to clean out for a while.
&gt;
&gt;If you know of where I could get one, I'd much appreciate it.   Thanks!
&gt;
