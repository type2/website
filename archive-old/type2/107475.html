Subject: Master cylinder for clutch

Newbie here again - if it isn't one thing, it is another.  The brakes are ok
now, but I can't seem to find the master cylinder for the clutch on a '68 -
as it needs fluid.  The stick slips into gear nicely when the engine is off,
but will not move when the engine is on - this happens with my Ranger at
times, and I just add dot 3 fluid to the slave cylinder.  Can't find that
either on the '68.

Thanks in advance

Susan
