&gt; Oh, ga$ just went to $2.05 for the high test, but I smugly quipped to

&gt; I meant that as good, but the guy shrugged and said, &quot;It could be

&gt; Sheesh....
&gt; What are you other listees getting on your mileage?

Hi Jamey,

I have a 2.0L 76 Westy with a Weber DFEV 32/36 two barrel progressive 
carburetor (compliments of the previous owner).  It is not known as a 
very fuel efficient carburetor so 17.3 is on the high side of my 
mileage.  It sounds like you're doing pretty well.  We bus drivers 
sometime forget that we are pushing a vehicle shaped like a Kleneex box 
through the air.

Jeff
