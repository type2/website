&gt; put the &quot;new&quot; one in, and it has too much

&gt; a few thousandths.  side to side (front/ rear
&gt; of engine) has more play than the others.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess the bearing in the &quot;new&quot; rod isn't
&gt; thick enough?

Hello Jennifer  You just cant put another rod and bearing on a crank that has 
spun a rod bearing  the crank itself will get tore up along with the bearing 
and another one will do the same in short order    You will need to rebuild 
the motor  later  Mark Dearing
