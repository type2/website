Subject: RE: [T2] Shift Pattern Drawing

Tell him not to feel bad. Took me forever to find it in a bus. In the
newer VW's (atleast a 2001 jetta wolfsburg) it is to the left and up by
first gear. Why cant they just all put it in the same place? :)

Reason I'm looking for the pattern is that my brother 
told me the other day that he just realized where the 
reverse was. He didn't know it was down and to the left 
of 2nd gear. He thought it was to the right of 4th gear. 
Good thing he didn't borrow the bus in the past two 
years!
