Subject: RE: [T2] What is best program to make a website?

get thee to a local library and learn how to write your own code for FREE.

all of the software you'll need to do it is also FREE.

it's much easier than you think. IMHO, if you can work on a bus you can
write web pages.

oh yeah, did i mention its FREE?
