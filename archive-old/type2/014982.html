The conversions on the new campers are actually done by Winnebago now I
believe. They only came in white until recently.

My question for the gurus

	My '79 Westy with the stock FI has been consistently getting 13mpg
lately(around town). I believe that I have it tuned properly.  Recently I
realized that my EGR is not connected- This wouldn't have anything to do
with that would it?

TIA 

Troy '79 Westy

&gt;What about them? We see these everyday. Westfalia has been building the ever
&gt;so familiar camper conversion since VW changed from T3 (Vanagon) to T4
&gt;(Eurovan) in 91/92.
