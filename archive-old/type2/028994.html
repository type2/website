See Jim? and all others expressing indignant alarm at the idea of whaking
the windshield to get it in?  Put one in, then tell me you didn't whack it
with something appropriate.  After the bottom of your hands are blue and the
thing still isn't moving, you look for something that's going to do the job.
A hammer.  But, DON'T hit the hammer against the glass.  That's obviously
stupid.  I didn't do that, I hit a good sized piece of plywood wrapped in a
towel, which was pressed against the glass.  And it was a careful hit.

Chris, did they replace the seal and the windshield for $69?  or did they
put the new windshield in with the old seal.  My new OEM seal cost about
$40.00, can't see how you got a new windshield, seal, and installation for
$69.00.  If they used the old seal, I wouldn't be surprised that urathane
sealant was necessary to get a tight seal.

I bought a $69 new windsheild from Safelite. They added $30 for
installation.  The second and third attempt to install it were free :) They
used a black urathane sealant. Windsheid does NOT leak now. We had to beat
the crap out of the windsheild  to get it in.  I provided a WCM seal for the
install. The seal is a little thin in the corners and exsposes some virgin
headliner.

18 months later leak free and happy.
