&gt;Sorry all, my girl's not looking for a new guy. ;)  I'm looking for a
&gt;bit of advice (and/or prayers) on how to avoid breaking an exhaust stud.

A very good idea.

&gt; I was looking at the exhaust studs,
&gt;and am wondering what's gonna happen when I put everything back together
&gt;and wrench the heat exchangers down snug.  I'd really hate for any of
&gt;those studs to snap; if one breaks, what then?  Does the engine have to
&gt;come out?  Exactly what does a weak stud look like?

Pitting from rust provides the stress risers that make cracks. If the
threads are the least bit pitted, replace them. Two nuts jammed together
can be used in most cases to back them out. If they don't want to come, use
the Bulley Tech. Tap the stud with a small, even tiny, hammer,
tap-tap-tap-tap over and over for 2 to 3 minutes. It really does help to
break a tight bond.

If you break one the only sure way to fix is to remove the head and take it
to a machinist. 

Note on standard procedure. Back off a 1/4 turn and retorque bolts to
factory spec before you disassemble. You want to know before reassembly if
they will hold torque. It takes a skilled feel to know something is giving
before it breaks. If something is weak, replace it and all like fasteners
before reassembly.
