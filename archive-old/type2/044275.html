&gt;The jack stands would be stable on concrete or similar surface, but
the knife edges of the base can obviously sink into a soft material.

Last year in a CC welding class, took both sets of my jackstands over and 
welded a square of fairly heavy gauge metal to the bottom of each. Works 
pretty good.
