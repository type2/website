&gt;If I had not been able to convince Larry (with whom I spoke on
&gt;the phone long distance at his cost) that the engine had not been
&gt;mistreated, it is unlikely that the outcome would have been as positive as
&gt;this one was.

Hmm. I bought my rebuilt engine from AVP. 1,500 miles after installation
we thought that there was a problem. They asked me to look under the engine
near the front. They put a small disk, about the size of a dime there.
If the engine is overheated, the center of the disk melts. This shows
weather the engine has been mistreated or not.
