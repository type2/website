Pedro,

Use a very thin screwdriver between the plastic horn button and the
metal ring to pry the button out. The metal ring fastens to the steering
wheel with 3 screws and will only bend if you get a screwdriver under
it. I learned this the hard way!

&gt; Craig's explenation about fixing the horn is very good.    Now, I
&gt; don't
&gt; whant to sound stupid but how _at_%&amp;*&amp;_at_  do I get the button off the
&gt; wheel.    I've been trying to get it off for several days and its been
&gt; impossible, in fact, I broke part of the wheel trying to force it out.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
