Subject: Re: [T2] Where is a good place to get a remanufactured/used
  engine?

 &gt;&gt;&gt;I'm tired of chasing demons in my engine&lt;&lt;&lt;
Which demons?

 &gt;&gt;&gt;I'm tired of wondering if I'm going to make it, or how much it's 
going to cost me next time.&lt;&lt;&lt;
I have lived that for 11k miles (last trip), cooked heads, bad carbs was 
my problem, it was solve for a lot less than the price of a new engine!

Nik, i feel for you! i fully understand! But whats wrong with your engine???
Why not fix this one, find the real problem , lot less money involve!!!

Anyway, here is another adress, in case you need this one, one friend of 
my is running an AVP engine since 2000, he is an happy camper.

But is old engine was rebuilt by me and a friend for a 1/4 of the price 
he paid the AVP!
Have this one checked out by a pro!

am talking about.
