&gt;   I know this discussion has taken place before, so I am not wanting to

&gt; (type 4 head) he promptly told me that they are all junk and that I should
&gt; put an upright Bug motor in the Bus. He offered to do the convertion for
&gt; something like $2500. I said no thanks, but then asked a few questions. I
&gt; will call him Bob also. Bob said that he did it for &quot;simplicity and
&gt; reliability&quot;. O.K., what do you do about the gap around the engine I asked.

he really is smoking the wacky weed.  there is no comparison
 buy your parts from him but don't let him touch your bus

also $2500 is about 3 times what it costs to do a chop job like he wants
to, he sees you as an all day sucker!
