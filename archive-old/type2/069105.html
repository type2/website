Subject: Weber vs. stock carb

Hello all:

I'm seeking conventional thought on this matter: Weber carb, or stock? I have
a '72 Westy and am replacing its engine, which has a Weber carb, with an
engine from a '73, which has stock carbs. The '73's  carbs were very recently
rebuilt. So the question: Swap carbs? Or leave them all alone?

FYI, I'm typically very pro-stock equipment. But in the case of these
carburetors, I believe VW may not have been as successful as in other areas.

Any thoughts greatly appreciated.
