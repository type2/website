I have never even considered going into a VW
dealership in the US because of some of the comments I
have heard on the list.

I have been to the dealership across the river in
Nuevo Laredo and they have always been nice and
helpful. They even gave me a partsbook! 
On one occasion they looked up ambulance fans for me
and they were still available. The cost kept me from
placing and order, though. I could buy another bus for
that kind of money!

&gt; poll, how many aircooled
&gt; &gt;owners have
&gt; &gt;had a &quot;positive&quot; experience at their local VW
