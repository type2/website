Subject: Re: [T2] why 1978?

Mike,
you reminded me of a vw show i went to when i lived in CA, the big event was 
the Engine Blow Raffle, where they put an upright motor in a metal cage, 
drained the oil, ran a fuel line over to a gas can, and took bets on how 
long it would run. my wife and i stood there, interested in the event, i had 
guessed about 12 minutes, and the thing went to about 18, then bang, wobble, 
wobble, clunk, clunk, thunk. I remember saying to my wife &quot;oh wait, i have 
heard that happen before...&quot;
(fond memories of the 71 sunroof bus).. please don't let it happen to the 77 
anytime soon...
-jeremy

&gt;78 is the first loaf with hydraulic lifters and the last year with the
&gt;common exhaust parts.  If I am correct, the 79 has a one-year exhaust
&gt;setup.  So, it's the last loaf worth getting before they switched body
&gt;styles and exhaust parts.
&gt;
&gt;I just got a 78 deluxe... got it in green, too :)  It's pretty nice..
&gt;except for the fact that I blew out the engine.. but then again, what vw
&gt;owner hasn't.. and.. what vw bus owner doesn't have 2 backup engines ..
&gt;hahaha

&gt; &gt; Why does everyone want a 78? I am always reading on the list that a 78 
&gt;is
&gt; &gt; the best year engine wise. Why is this? I would think a 79 would be 
&gt;better
&gt; &gt; because it is newer and has the available exhaust pieces.
