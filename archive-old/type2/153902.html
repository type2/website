Subject: Re: [T2] Stripped Bolt Misery

From GEORGE:
 
Anyone have any ideas on removing the three stripped bolts from the fan?

Oh, did I mention that they're kind of stripped and in there tighty tight 
tight? I thought it was a regular 6 point.... That's what happens when you 
pay attention elsewhere...
 
 Thanks for listening to my misery.....

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

It might be easier just to replace the fan.
You are talking about the cooling fan on the end of the crankshaft on a type 4 engine?
I have a complete one......
