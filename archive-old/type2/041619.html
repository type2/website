&gt; How old does a VW have to be before it does not need converting to US specs

To be legally imported into the United States a vehicle must meet all
standards in place as of the date of manufacture of the vehicle, both
emissions and safety.  The first year for such standards was 1967, so any
vehicle made before that is an automatic pass.  After that things start
getting a little more complicated.  Emissions specs in the early years
were pretty easy to meet, and the safety specs usually mean changing light
bulbs and maybe lenses.  Since VW was making and selling US-spec vehicles
(our buses :), a trip to the junk yard will usually get you the bits you
need.  For later models where you need 5mph bumpers, air bags, side impact
protection, etc., etc. things are *much* more complicated.

In addition, there is a fairly stiff bureaucratic maze that must be
traversed.  EPA, DOT, and Customs all need to be satisfied.  It *can* be
done, but it is usually not worth the effort.  

For the latest years, (Brizilian current production), it is flatly
impossible to do this *legally*. You would have to bring in a dozen or
more, modify all to meet current airbag and impact standards, crash all
but one of that dozen to satisfy DOT, then they would let you keep the
last one... say half a million or more for one car.  I am not saying that
there are not a couple that have been smuggled in, or brought in by
diplomats, but they are not legal and never will be.
