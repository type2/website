&gt; Question #1:
&gt;
&gt; I went to my FLAPS and I was flabbergasted when they told me, &quot;We don't
&gt; carry a battery for a 76 Transporter, nor do I even have a listing for
it.&quot;
&gt; Hmmm, so, to those of you out there with a 76 Westy (or otherwise), what
&gt; kind of battery do you individuals recommend?
&gt;
&gt; Question #2:
&gt; Has anyone ever tried to rig a second battery to operate say...radio,
&gt; lights and other such things.  I was thinking of what to do while camping
&gt; without city power.  I want to be able to run some interior lights, a
&gt; stereo and a cigarette lighter (for a computer...I know, I know....) from
&gt; auxiliary power, so as not to drain the main battery.  Also, how would
this
&gt; battery be connected so that it could be charged while driving?  Could I
&gt; install some sort of switch...you know...park, turn of the bus, flip the
&gt; switch...aux. power!
&gt;
&gt; If anyone knows of such things OR could direct me to a web site...that
&gt; would be glorious!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance!
&gt; Missy:)
