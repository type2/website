In brief:
Remove all plugs (gotta remove the air cleaner with air sensor
attached-unscrew the rubber connection to the throttle housing, pull off
the connector to the air sensor, undo the clips under the air cleaner,
remove the right hose from the aux. fan, and pull out the whole
aircleaner.)
Use the upper engine hatch for the rear spark plug holes.  Use a screw
in gauge which separates at the hose end- Sears has it.  Memorize the
angle the plug is in; for removal/reinsertion I use a socket with foam
in it to grip the plug and a 5 or 6&quot; extension that LOCKS the socket to
it.  After placing the socket plus extension onto the plug, note WHERE
the top of the extension is relative to the firewall for the rear plugs,
and where the end points to in the ceiling of the engine compartment. 
This will save cursing as you try to hand thread the plug back in
holding the the extension end- you'll never cross-thread that way.  Same
for inserting the compression gauge flexible tube- hand thread it in
minus the gauge (just compress the o-ring), then snap on the gauge. 
Prevent any possible spark by removing the high tension center wire from
the coil or yanking the + wire from the coil.  Have a friend crank it
(full throttle) while you watch the gauge and yell when it peaks.  If a
cylinder is low, squirt some oil in the spark plug hole and repeat- it
should go up a lot if it's worn rings, only a little if a burnt valve or
a very tight one (adjust please!).
