Subject: Screw near base of 34PDSIT carb

Does anybody know where I can buy spare adjustment screws that fit at
the base of the left and right 34PDSIT carbs?  I don't know what
they're called, but I believe they're used to sync the carbs.

From what I can tell by looking at online catalog photos, the typical
$15 rebuild kits don't include them... but surely they must be
available for purchase somewhere.
