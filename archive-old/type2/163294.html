Subject: Re: [T2] Window Seal and headliner

Install the headliner first, then the window seals.  Usually the edge of the
headliner material is attached over the flange of the windshield opening on
pickups (not sure about the rear window).

On Beetles, Ghias, Notch, Square&amp;Fastbacks, the material edge attaches to
the quarter window and rear window flange openings.

&gt; Q: Which comes first the headliner install or the window install? Can the
&gt; headliner be installed after the window is in?
&gt; Just trying to get my scheduling down for my project.
&gt; Also K,HUGE props to Chris and Jon at BustedBus. They spend most of this
&gt; weekend helping me get all of my windows, rubber and  trim IN. Not only is
&gt; it in, it is installed perfectly and professionally. I can't stop
&gt; grinning.
&gt; Pics very soon.
