Subject: body work

This summer I was determined to restore the body on my bus.  However, I
really don't have any experience with doing body work.  I have no
problem giving it a whirl and making mistakes, but I know that I need
some welding done.  This I am not sure if I can do.  Here is my
question.  Is it unusual to find a donor body and swap some non rusted
panels for rusted panels?  I'm looking to specifically replace the
slider, engine cover, rear hatch, two front doors, and the nose.  Is
this insane?  If it can be done are there specific years that are
interchangeable?  Lastly, if anyone in Chicago or the Chicago burbs
knows of a person that enjoys doing body work and/or would like to show
me a thing or two please drop me a line.
thanks y'all
Sean
