Aren't these the fabled &quot;Ambulance Fans ?&quot;  - a sought after accessory.
Strangely - enough I saw some just yesterday at Bugfreeze for around £70.
(UK Pounds) 
Would have loved to buy them myself - along with a host of other goodies (T2
Clocks, Zig Units, Roof Racks etc...)
But other bits were more of a priority  (Genuine German VW 1600 Heat
Exchangers - £90 a pair  - a bargain !!!)

&gt; 
&gt; Anyone out there have a lead on those nifty fans that go in the fresh-air
&gt; ducts, just below the dash?
&gt; I know at least one Listte has them (got 'em from Mexico I believe)...
&gt; local junkyard is out.
&gt; Pmail me if you know the whereabouts and costage of said bugger.
&gt; TIA
