Subject: Re: Saggy Rear End

My bus has that exact same problem.  There should be a how-to on it in the
library.  What you have to do is pull the plates off the torsion arms and pull
them out to release the pressure, turn them up a notch (each notch is said to
give about three inches lift on good torsion bars that don't sag) and shove them
back in.  It's not as painful as it sounds.

    Wait, I'm wrong, it wasn't in the library.

These two urls will tell you everything you need.  The first site will point you
to the second.  It's from a guy who makes baha buses.

    Have fun, and let me know how it goes, as I have to do the same job soon.
