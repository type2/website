Greetings
So I took my  fuel tank out today. I tried the method of not removing =
the engine, but just lowering it a couple inches by unbolting =
transmission carrier and rear mount bolts.
Having now done it both ways I think this method is best, for me anyhow. =
I may change my mind tomorrow when I'm installing it.
I removed the tank because I thought I might (hoped) have something in =
my tank that was creating my fuel delivery problems.
Thankfully I was right and I didn't do all this work for nothing.
The Seal-All plug I used to plug my filler tube vent had indeed fallen =
into the tank and was intermitently covering the pickup.
Now I have plugged this tube at the bottom with a bolt and clamp.

Hopefully I can put this thing together and get another 2 or 3 years of =
problem free running out of it.
Hopefully others can learn from my mistakes.;-)
Brian
