Subject: '79 Cal bus - EGR filter?

Do the '79 California busses NOT have an EGR filter and valve?
I don't see one on my '79, and it does not look like one was ever
there. Bentley talks about an EGR for a '79 bus, but I am wondering
if that only means the Federal model. Does the O2 sensor on the
'79 Cal bus somehow replace the EGR filter and valve?
