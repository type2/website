Subject: telling if cam bearing is bad

Actually 231,700 mi now....so what is the symptom of a bad cam bearing,
since many rebuild just the top end and rods?? 
Is bearing material magnetic (is it bronze?)  I had noticed some fine
metal flakes in the strainer a while ago that appeared silvery, but was
not magnetic.  The oil pressure is great at startup/warmup (60-65 in 30
deg weather), but if the oil gets to 250 degr, the pressure is about 20
at 3000 rpm and it will rise at greater rpms .

&gt; And I'd bet that Mike Benthin's type 4 engine with now (is it 228,000
&gt; miles?) has had a bad cam bearing for probably the last 10 years or so.
