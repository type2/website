Subject: She's gone now

My bus is the &quot;she.&quot; Her name is Luna. I knew her for 18 months. She was, 
without a shadow of a doubt, the finest vehicle I have ever had the pleasure 
of owning. Yesterday a nice man from Kansas City came to take her away to 
her new home. I think she'll be happy there. I, on the other hand, am sad 
today -- a sort of sadness which no amount of money ever takes away.

And I wanted to thank a few people:

1) The list and it's administrators and benefactors, for providing the venue 
by which the bus sold. It was listed on the Samba (thanks, Everett) but it 
was the classifieds on the Type2 website that caught the eye of the new 
owner.

2) Two listmembers in particular, without whom the overhaul (I hesitate to 
say restoration, but it was close) of this beautiful '71 would not have been 
possible:

Mr. Jason Z. Upper, of Aspen and late of Asheville, N.C., whose hard work 
and good company helped improve what was once a very worn bus chassis into a 
smooth, tight, highway warrior of a machine. I can not thank him enough. If 
you are close to Asheville and need bus assistance, you will find a ready 
and knowledgeable hand in Jason. Bring him good bourbon.

Mr. Chuck Notmeyer of Reno, NV, Volkswagen collector extraordinaire and 
holder of the record for most cool buses I have ever seen parked in the same 
garage. A garage I lived in for a week last spring. He is a kind man with a 
lovely family and a heart made of 86% magnesium alloy. The kind of guy who 
sets his valves at .004, because he can.

3) Dr. Porsche and Herr Pon

4) The Colorado VW Bus Club, a fine organization which I will someday join. 
I am very grateful to its members for their support, good humor and toilet 
paper.

5) Mr. Michael Brands, of Aspen, whose skilled photography made for one hell 
of a classified ad.

6) And finally, Mr. Steve Tubbert of Kansas City, MO (actually Kansas, but a 
short walk to Missouri), who is the proud and anxious new owner of a 1971 
Westfalia, in which his daughters will grow up. I could not be happier for 
him. He knows he has just bought the Best Bus Ever. In fact it is our little 
secret. Thank you, Steve, and good luck. May you own her for many happy 
years.

Until the next one, I remain...
