Subject: [T2] pair of wiper arms 68- 2 different ones?

Although my pictures showed the entire wiper arms, they didn't show the side 
bolts on a good angle...
So, mine have sideways bolts too...
I know they are very hard to find...and if Chris doesn't have any I will 
change them for the 69 model...
Thanks for your kind answers...
I'm glad you treated me so well  as you do with  &quot;native english speakers&quot;.
Once more &quot;OBRIGADO!&quot; (thank you!)

Best regards from Lisbon, Portugal


&gt;&gt; ****Aren't there 2 different wipers used in 68?  Correct me if I'm wrong.
&gt;&gt;  *The &quot;earlier&quot; being similar to Splitties and just &quot;clipping&quot; over the 
&gt;&gt; shaft and...
&gt;&gt;  *The &quot;later&quot; having the sideways bolts/nuts.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I have the &quot;later&quot; 68 only arms- the bolted kind.
&gt;&gt;  But, a local 68 DC (you know who you are :-) and the pictures that Joao 
&gt;&gt; just sent me confirm the &quot;earlier&quot; kind without the sideways bolts.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Or, did someone just put splittie wipers on these 68's (without the 
&gt;&gt; sideways bolts)?
