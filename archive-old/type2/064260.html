Subject: Re: my bus looks stupendous! :)

&gt; After having procrastinated this job for about three years, I have
&gt; finally decided to pay someone else to do it for me: a complete
&gt; buffing, polishing and waxing on the previously pale and tarnished
&gt; looking Yosemite Yellow Camper. It looks GORGEOUS!! Like new. The guy
&gt; at Ziebart was surprised as well by the result. 
&gt; 
&gt; So if you're thinking about a new paint job, try buffing a small patch
&gt; with some rubbing compound first...
&gt; 

I did the same to my white '71 bus. I was amazed at how great it looked. 
I would highly recommend trying this, buffing a little spot with rubbing 
compound. It'll take you 5 minutes, and you might be pleasantly surprised.

Jon
