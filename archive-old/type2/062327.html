Subject: Re: What's a Dormobile please? 

Many have written:
&gt; Dormobile this, dormobile that, dormobile, dormobile, dormobile...

I figured they were some funny old 50's era buses with strange
doors and I wondered about the spelling. Then someone posted:
- --------------
... half the buses are pop top campers thiough, and people call all
the buses dormobiles, regardless of whether they were altered by the
dormobile company or notor not
- ----------------

OK, I give up. What's a frigging DORMOBILE, please? Is it something like
the American ASI poptops that I've seen on some late '60's buses (the ones
that go straight up, luggage rack in front, double bed like the later Westys)?

PLease enlighten me, si voux plais. 

Thanks,
Surfer Bob

PS- I'm pretty sure that FLAPS is &quot;from (my) local auto (or aftermarket?) parts
store.&quot; Correcto on this count?
