&gt;&gt;This one has me kind of stumped. I need to pull the instrument panel to
&gt;&gt;replace some lamps, but the trick to removing the plastic plugs that
&gt;&gt;hold the levers in place eludes me.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The bad news is that it is virtually impossible to remove the brittle
&gt;plastic plugs without breaking them.
&gt;
&gt;The good news is that you will never miss them.  The levers are held in
&gt;place by the leaf springs very nicely.

Oh ho -- that is indeed bad news and good news.  Thanks all!
