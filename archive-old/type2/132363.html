Interesting...

I have a middle 2/3 seat which is basically an open top melamine/chipboard
box with a seat on top which slides on runners.  For some reason this box
stays a long way below ambient temperature - it's not vented or anything and
there's a large gap at the back of the seat.  Could also be a good place to
build in an icebox methinks.
