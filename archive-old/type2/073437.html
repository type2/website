How did that get to be the general concensus?  My VDO gauges are within a
few percent of accurate and I have almost a dozen of them in my bus
(counting the factory ones).  Does anyone really think that VDO would still
be in business after (guessing) 30 years if all of their gauges were off by
a huge amount?  There will always be the occasional lemons as with anything
that is mass produced, but VDO is a quality gauge.  Way ahead of the cheapo
stuff you find at the local FLAPS.

If you still don't want to buy VDO, try Autometer.  They have a good
reputation in the racing world.
