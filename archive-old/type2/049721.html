Subject: [T2] Holley 5200 linkage

I have a Holley 5200 on my '72 camper. The throttle cable comes into the
engine compartment on the left when viewed from the rear of the bus. The
linkage on the carburetor is on the right if viewed from the front of the
carb, the side on which the idle adjust screw is positioned. The PO's
solution was to put the carb on backwards. This aligned the linkage with the
throttle cable but put the adjusting screws towards the front of the bus and
out of sight. I'd like to install the carb with the adjusting screws facing
the rear. A couple of posts deal with this, but they are not very specific
regarding a solution.  Any help appreciated. Also, Can I solve the problem
by switching to a Weber 32/36 or is the linkage on a Weber similarly
situated, that is on the right hand side when facing the idle adjusting
screw?

Thanks
