Subject: Escutcheon tool

If you do a lot of junk-yarding you'll probably hate dealing with those
escutcheons holding the headlight switch on. At least I do.

I recently borrowed such a tool from my friend. It's the right type of tool
but not designed specifically for VWs: the tangs engage the cutouts well
enough. Of course with a little filing it would be perfect but it's not my
tool to subject to the grinder. Plus you end up grinding off the protective
chrome finish and the tool wants to rust unless you keep it greased.

Hooray for all the people that have made their own from a screwdriver or
chisel and saved millions but a question for the rest: does anyone know who
else makes such a tool?

The one in the picture is Snapon S5908 and it has just been discontinued (a
few left in inventory of course). I also found the screwdriver at
www.bfyobsoleteparts_dot_com who charges a markup from the Snapon price which
I'm not going to pay. BFY also sells them on ebay. There's one in auction
right now and the last one I saw went for $66. eBay bidders sure are
uninformed sometimes. The auction didn't even say NOS! :-)
