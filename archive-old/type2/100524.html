Subject: flickering oil light

Hi everyone
My 74 Westy has been letting out light, little backfires every once in a
while.  This usually happens when I shift up into a higher gear.  At the
same time my oil light flickers.  It just got a tune up but was something
done wrong?  Any suggestions?  Thanks a lot.
TARA
