	I recently acquired a 914 motor to replace the '71 1600 DP in my '68. 
As most of you probably know the 914 isn't compatible with the '68
transmission.  I have a late bus flywheel and clutch, but I need a
'75-'79 transmission to put in to make this run, I also need a either a
complete dual carb setup(manifolds, linkage, etc.) or a complete FI
setup.  I have a good condition '68 tranny, and many parts from the '71
engine I am willing to trade for these parts(also willing to trade cash).
 Please help me, my mom won't let me drive her car any more and I have to
hurry up and get my bus running.

Thanks in advance,
Dion and Maud
(Maud is the car, and Dion is the guy underneath it)
