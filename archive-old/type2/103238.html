&gt; &gt;Anymore info availible on this procedure?  My '71 box is feeling a little

&gt; What about the tie rods and steering dampner?

Good point.  If the steering feels &quot;crunchy&quot; at the same wheel postion the
steering box is bad and replacement is the only route.

If the steering is otherwise smooth, but feels &quot;loose&quot; then you more
likely have problems downstream from the steering box.  Either the drag
link, swing lever, and/or tie rods might well be the culprits.
