&gt;Added a few drops of oil on #1 but only saw a rise to
&gt;95 so not suspecting rings.

I don't know could be a broken ring or a small piece of the piston broken off.
that fact that it only went up to 95 might mean you've got some crapola built up
behind the valve, or the valve could be starting to leak. I'd get a set of
rings, one
new valve, some lapping compound, and hope its not a broken piston.
