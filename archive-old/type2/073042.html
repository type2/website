     Hi,   I am Matthias from Germany. I am member of the  German
VW-Bus-Club &quot;VW-Van-Family&quot;.   We are about 40 mebers with VW-Busses &gt;from
1962 to  1999. But all of them are the German version without parking
lights at the  turning-signals.   Do the amercan versions have these
parking lights.  If the have, I am interested in the part-numbers of the
brackets and  bulbs.   Please tell me if you have any information about
that for me, or where I can get it.   Thanks a lot     Matthias
