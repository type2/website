Subject: Re: [T2] door lube-
Cc: type2_at_type2_dot_com

There is a white grease stick that comes in tube that looks like a giant
tube of chap stick.  Great stuff, I use it on everything from zippers to
the moving parts on my hydraulic tubing bender.  Can be used to reduce wear
on door latches and if you rub a little on the rubber seal, the door closes
easier and it won't freeze shut!!

I got it at the local True Value Hardware store in the isle where they keep
the special lubes such as 3 in 1 and WD 40.


&gt;Gentlepersons-
&gt;                       With yesterday's 60 degree temps and this morning's
&gt;low 30's, coupled
&gt;with rain, the doors on my bus were frozen shut. Anybody have a solution/lube
&gt;to pre-
&gt;vent this from happening? I'd prefer not to rip the gaskets when these temp
&gt;swings
&gt;cause the moisture to freeze. And, yes, I used a variable heat gun to defrost
&gt;the per-
&gt;imeter of the door before opening it; but there's gotta be a better way...
