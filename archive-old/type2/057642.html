Subject: Trip Report - Sally's first outing

Hello list, ARE YOU RECEIVING ME, OVER.  Ah, that's better, good to be
back.

The last couple of months have been a mad rush to get the bus back on
the road for what passes as the English summer.  In my last post I said
we were having a problem with the carbs.  I had my mechanic strip down
both carbs because I had to get back to work.  He replaced one of the
idle cutoff valves with a used one, and then each carb got a nice new
needle valve and cleaned out thoroughly.  I brought the bus back home
but it was still running rough and wouldn't idle properly.

After a couple of weeks I had all the interior back in with the side
panels covered in new vinyl and a new floor, which I fashioned from 1/4&quot;
ply with 2 layers of expanded polyethylene underneath and some lino
stuck to the top.  I also stuck sheets of closed cell foam inside all
the outer panels to give me some insulation/soundproofing.

Our first camping trip was a night at Castle Howard (about 30-40 miles
away), me, wife Ruth and the 3 kids.  We didn't want to be too ambitious
in case something went wrong.  The first day the bus was still running
rough but I filled up with petrol in the evening and put some Redex in
with it.  Next morning I started her up and there was a big puff of
smoke from the rear and ... everything was fine.  Idle OK, very smooth,
no hesitation.  Whatever the problem was, I think the Redex did the
trick.

Last week we went to Scotland for a few days, had a great time, Sally
ran well, no problems.  Saw lots of other type 2s, waved to them, they
waved back.  On the way we even saw our very own Bob Wallace in his
brand new Brazillian camper, what are the chances of that happening?
Didn't know it was him till later though.

It's good to be up and running again after over a year of rebuilding.
Now I just have to reconnect the heater, replace the washer bottle with
one that doesn't leak, and get the gear linkage a bit tighter so Ruth
can find the gears.
