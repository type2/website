Subject: fuel shut off valve

I agree that a fuel shut off valve would be a handy
addition to my bus. Until I find something to work, my
handy angled needle-nosed vise grips do a great job of
cutting off the flow when changing filters.
On the subject of fires, while taking the engine out
of my wrecked '74, I discovered cracked fuel lines.
Had that bus not been wrecked, it probably would have
burned. These hoses were not even three years old and
were NOT the cloth covered German stuff. I'll never
use anything but the proper hose from now on!
