&gt;You responders have been enormously helpful, Steve and David.  Thank you. 
&gt;I'm going to avoid the Yoko's. And I see no reason to go with the 
&gt;Bridgestones, over the Continentals, and some reasons to probably avoid them.
&gt;
&gt;It looks like I will be going with the Continentals......lowest price, no 
&gt;negative replies, pretty similar to what I am already using.

My tires were also so old that they transferred every bump in the road to my rear.  I had no idea until I put on soft new tires.

I bought the Continentals after the original post from Nemo the Bus Captain and this recommendation:

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/092515.html

I've been using them for 5 months now and I just drove halfway across country on them for 1800 miles.  All I can say is that they're quiet, handle nicely and work perfectly in the rain. In other words they look and act stock.

I'll need a couple of years to provide an truly informed opinion but I can't say you'll be initially disappointed.  I did a lot of research before I bought tires and the one question still left in my mind is why VW says a 185R14R tire is best for a 1972 Camper and later and why a commerical tire is best for 1973 and later Station Wagon and Delivery van.
