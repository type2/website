VW used to be that way...my '00 Jetta had free maintenance for the first 2 
years while it was under warranty, now that they've increased the warranty 
to 5 years, you have to pay for it.  I guess that's what enables them to 
afford the longer warranty!  We're paying for it!  (I gotta get some bus 
content in here somehow....) g

&gt;All maintenance is included in the purchase price (synth oil to boot!) for 3
&gt;years.

&gt; &gt; not sure what the $150 covers...I started bitching about it (nicely) and
&gt; &gt; they said they take the wheels off and check the brakes and a lot of stuff
&gt; &gt; and it is real involved...what choice do I have?
