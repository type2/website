Subject: I killed my 68 DC engine

Subject says it all darn it! I was so stoked after my trip to OCTO and was
looking forward to driving my bus again and then on the way to work at 2 am
I think I holed a piston or burned a valve. I found out why they call the
Altamont Pass the &quot;Bus killer&quot; as I only just started up trying to pass that
last 18 wheeler at 62mph so I could pull over into the slow lane when I felt
a vibration ( no not the good kind) and a loss of power. My first
inclination was that I blew another plug wire off but a quick stab of the
clutch pedal and some revs proved it was still firing on all 4. So I limped
home at 40 mph for 60 miles and here I sit.
I called Ronnie at Old Volks Home and he made an interesting suggestion to
use some 88 cut in P&amp;C's since they are ideal for a bus since they have
extremely thick piston tops. I'm seriously considering doing this with a
74mm stroker crank ( another Ronnie idea) but funds may play a factor.
Anyone have a stock set of P&amp;C's in new or good shape they would consider
selling me? Ok now for the real needle in a haystack, I have a Porsche 912
engine which also needs a P&amp;C set or just 1 if you have a broken set, anyone
have any 912/356 Porsche P&amp;C's I can buy? Thanks and I apologize if this is
too long of a post to the list.
