Subject: Running Diesel thru Dual Carbs..?????

The other day I was re reading some &quot;Muir Musings&quot;.....
in regards to section in his book where he talks about
running quart of diesel thru carbs..for cleaning
engine/carbs????

Any merit to this?? Or just wating my time, energy
and money...??

My 74 Bus has 1800 cc dual Solex with 100,000 miles.

Glen
