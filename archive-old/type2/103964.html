&gt;  I don't see how

&gt; which to pull like a bug does.  greg


Your right Greg, pulling on the gen pully and in a bus has to be tough! John has
a snowmobile recoil pull cord modified to fit the CRANK pulley, also, he changed
the prop for the engine deck so it gives enough room to pull the cord. He made
the engine deck lid stand up almost against the upper hatch door.

To aid in the starting, he made a throttle lock and choke pull, so he can set up
the choke, give it a little gas, then pull the cord!  One good pull will start
it ... out on the cold frozen lake on top of the ice fishing holes!
