Subject: Re: [T2] Re: where to find GL4 80W90 gear oil

&lt;sigh&gt;  Archives is a *great* idea, but I'll cut to the chase.  GL-5 
spec gear oil contains extreme pressure additives that can be quite 
unkind to the brass synchros in your VW gearbox.  It won't make it blow 
up today or tomorrow, but it will shorten its life.

Google &quot;API GL4&quot; and &quot;VW 501.50&quot;  You'll find that every reference that 
contains the VW spec does not contain GL-5.

The very best reason to use GL4 spec gear oil in VW MANUAL transmissions 
is because that's the specification from VW.  GL5 is spec'd for the 
differential in VW/Audi automatic transmissions.
