One of the simplest, cheapest and most effective anti-theft devices (IMHO) is
simply a switch to turn off the fuel pump. (Assuming, of course, you're driving
a vehicle with an electric fuel pump.) The switch can be mounted anywhere, even
in plain sight (as long as you don't label it!)

On carbureted vehicles it allows the bus/car to be started and moved far enough
into traffic so that when the engine quits it creates a major attraction,
something no thief wants. A fuel-injected bus wouldn't start at all, which
isn't bad, either. OTOH a bus with a mechanical fuel pump would be history.
