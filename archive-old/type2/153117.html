Subject: Re: [T2] endplay

Hello Jen  You havent given us all the info   but here is the scoop  the 
paper and/or metal gaskets that go on the end of the crank were only used up till 
1967.  the 12 volt flywheel has a rubber o ring in it that takes their place . 
 So if you have a upright type 1 engine that has the o ring flywheel then you 
dont need these gaskets .  Try to get the end play between .002 and .006 in.  
  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
