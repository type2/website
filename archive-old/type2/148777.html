Subject: Re: Engine lubrication, valves

Hi,

I talked to someone who said you could get special valves + rockers
and they would do this:

oil gets pumped through pushrods, lubricates rockers.  Oil also
travels to the point where rocker pushes against valve.  The valve
stem is hollow, and has holes that allow oil to come out between the
stems and guides...

Is this really an available upgrade, or was the guy talking out his tail
pipe?

Jenny
