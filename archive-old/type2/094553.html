Subject: Re: [T2] gear box?


I cant find any brackets in any diagrams i have.  I cant get out under 
mine right now to check to see what is there.  I only show a rubber stop 
plate on one side and the rest is free suspended in any picture i check 
in a haynes or a bently or in the etka.  Every linkage i have worked on 
has been free floating.  I you dont have the bentley, the haynes also 
gives good description on how to adjust the shifter.  Note that 
transmission linkages can be very finicky and touchy  Though i havent 
tampered with mine yet, i did a quick inspection shortly after getting 
my 82 westy for a basic familiarization of what was where. I saw 4 areas 
that i noted  that  could cause  shift problems.  After looking in the 
bentley i expanded that to  6 areas with wear potential to cause shift 
problems.
also saw an interesting note on a bearing just now.. What year was yours?
