&gt;What does the horizontal shock absorber thing on the steering do ? I think

&gt;What happens if it's not working ? How long does it last ? I've never
&gt;replaced on one of either my bus or bug. Should I ?
==============================&gt;
Very seldom to ever need to replace these guys unless they start to exhibit 
a leak, and then replace them before they fail.

When they fail.............

Nothing bad happens for a while because you cannot stand to drive your 
vehicle when they fail.

Every time you hit a bump, the steering wheel will vibrate like wild in 
your grip.
Then, you know to replace the steering damper.

What does a proper damper do? It &quot;dampens&quot; the road vibrations so that they 
cannot be transmitted into the steering train and into your hands.

What does a faulty damper do? None of the above, and you get 
vvvvvviiiiibbbbbrrrrraaaaatttttiiiiiooooonnnnn in your hands.
