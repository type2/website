&gt; A dab of silicone on the underside of the engine or hood, directly on each

Having lost an emblem to some punk gang-banger type, I would suggest
threading the pins on the emblem and then attaching it from behind with
nuts.  You can get flanged rubber washers at hardware stores to fill up
the holes.
