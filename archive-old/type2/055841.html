Subject: Re: My ignition switch problem

Many, many thanks for all the responses concerning my ignition switch 
problem.  I'm in the unfortunate situation of having only one vehicle, 
and not the funds to take problems to a mechanic.  So when a problem 
grounds the bus, my capital with the wife ticks away fast.

The problem was the lock cylinder, and with some uncouth work the 
steering column came off.  Cylinder was switched out quickly and cheaply, 
and the bus started up quite happily.  After putting the steering wheel 
back on, it started to wiggle about a little bit.  I suspect I neglected 
to properly seat this funky looking little metal bushing.  Not sure, but 
for now I'm just glad it's starting so well.

Again, thanks to all the advice.
