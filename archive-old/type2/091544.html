&gt; RE: '78 Westy; is the door buzzer fused??

No, it is not.  Power for this comes:

from the battery to terminal 30 on the starter (the *big* wire);
from terminal 30 to the fuse box (fuse #9(
from fuse #9 to fuse #8 on a jumper in the box;
from fuse #8 to terminal 30 on the ignition switch;
from terminal 30 (ignition switch) on an internal jumper thru a set of
     contacts to terminal Su;
from terminal Su to terminal 85 on the buzzer module;
from terminal 86 on the buzzer module to the door switch;
from the door switch, thru a set of contacts to ground.

No fuse anywhere in the circuit.

&gt; That is, will it buzz even if all the fuses are pulled out? (and key in
&gt; ignition, and driver door open and battery . . .)

Yes it will.  If the key is in and the door is open and the buzer module
is present, it's gonna buzz.  OTOH, who has one of the buzzer boxes
present?????? I have not seen one in years!!!!
