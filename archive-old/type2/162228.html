Subject: Re: hydraulic lifters, Dell carb set up, and distributors...

All,
I did change the oil.  I will adjust those out to zero lash, and just see
if I can get it to quiet down, and go from there.  I will try to keep the
list posted.

Have a great day!

&lt;
&lt;I think Boston Bob's advice is sound.  What you have to have BEFORE
adjusting carbs or timing is confidence that your &lt;valves are all fully
opening and closing. If not, whatever settings you make now will only be
temporary since the &lt;operation of the engine is changed considerably when
they do open and close fully.
&lt;
&lt;I'd leave it run with zero lash for a awhile.  I assume you changed the
oil. You may need some good oil additive &lt;formulated to remove varnish/gum
to get at the lifter interiors if this doesn't work.  If THAT doesn't work
it is &lt;
