Subject: engine hatch open - just say no

The engine hatch of a BUS should be left CLOSED while driving (and the
seals should be intact, first off) and here's why:
the bus takes advantage of what is known as the Kamm, or boattail, effect;
flow over a gradually tapering object which then  abruptly makes an acute
angle will have reduced drag. The air  flowing along the sides of the
object will form an eddy which 'adheres' the the flat surface of the rear
of the object; technical terms like 'laminar flow' and turbulence could be
used if ya wanted to be bored, but the upshot is that a smooth,
non-turbulent flow of air is going past your bus, and this cuts down the
drag coefficient. Works on boats and V2 missiles, too!

What does this have to do with the dang hatch? Those eddies the boattail
creates are flowing in  spirals towards the center of the bus rear end;
this means the air is somewhat stagnant, (and this is why you shouldn't use
a bug exhaust which shoots out straight back, neither - all the exhaust
fumes are just following you down the road!), and this air is coming up
from UNDER the bus as well. HEATED
air from up under the bus. Air your fan just got finished dumping OUT.

So- anyways. Here we are with our bus toodling along, Kamm effect giving us
that huge drag reduction ;) and then we go and open up the engine hatch.
All that stale, hot air (and some warm exhaust fumes) is swirling around
the rear, and that greedy fan is quite happy to suck it all back IN. Hot
air INTO the engine compartment means higher operating temps for your bus.
Which is bad.

A B*g is different: it has laminar flow OVER the TOP; popping the lid up
with a stand-off turns the lid into a giant air SCOOP, ramming more air
into the engine compartment. A b*g benefits from leaving the lid  open as
long as you leave the HINGE side open. Driving around with a b*g lid open
wide in the normal way is a nono because you're disturbing the flow to the
fan  (starving it  and increasing drag, too).

Now, make a big scoop that goes across the top of your bus and rams more
air down the side vents and you got something!

I have a feeling this is a 'synthetic or regular oil' type discussion, and
you all will choose your own path, but this is the physics behind why you
SHOULD NOT drive with the lid off. Can't argue with physics - go ahead,
try! 3rd law is a good one to fight with.

NOTE: popping the hatch when STOPPED will help cool things off faster, due
to the physics of convection and radiative emission etcetc, plus all the
spit you fling on the case to see how hot it is cools it down some:).
