It is possible to fit a VW Beetle twin-port engine into a 1968-79 VW Type 2, 
but you will need a special rear engine mount adapter.

One of these was featured on page 20, of my J.C. Whitney, Summer 1996 VW 
Catalogue (Catalogue No. 50J), listed as part No. 37AR8020X, priced at 
$11.99. J.C. Whitney, may be contacted, as follows :-

J.C. Whitney
2319 S. Throop Street
P.O. Box 804719
Chicago
Illinois 60680-4108

Tel. 1-312-431-6102
Fax. 1-312-431-5625

Another design (I believe it to be better engineered), was featured on page 
80 (new products' page), of the February 1999 issue of VW Motoring, 
published in Great Britain.

This adapter was/is available from:-

Small Car,
Volkswagen Specialists,
Unit A,

Great Britain

Tel. +44 (0)1276 29595

Sorry I have no e-mail or web site addresses for either of these. I look 
forward to hearing how you resolve your engine installation.

Regards.
