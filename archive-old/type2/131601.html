Subject: Re: [T2] Bentley on Automatics

Same year and month here 11/76. It is not Sage Green is it? I bought the 
seal and the filter screen from Bus Depot. Great fit looked exactly like 
what I took out. Nice and tight like Prom night(my tuxedo). That screen 
should be cleanable. I opted for a new one because I didn't know the history 
of the bus. The screen is all metal. The cover that holds it in place is 
shaped differently than the pics in Bentley. Instead of the round disc with 
the single screw it is egg shaped with the screw that runs through the 
center of the filter screen and one off set screw. I did however look at a 
seal that was at NAPA the other day. Looked the same as the one I used. 
Since I didn't have the old one I couldn't verify it.

&gt;Basically I am just wondering about the servicing - it's unclear as to
&gt;whether there is a replacable filter screen, or a cleanable one. It's an
&gt;early '77 (made 11/76) I don't want to have to take it apart before going
&gt;to the FLAPS if possible. Want to get the correct gasket as well, and also
&gt;I didn't see a fill plug for the gearbox.
