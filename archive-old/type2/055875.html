Subject: My Kombi is back home, rebuild is due.

Well, my son brought my Kombi back home on Saturday. He's had it in 
Sydney for a couple of months while his motorcycle was being 
repaired.

Had to take it to town yesterday (15 miles return) and it was good to 
get back in and drive it. Everything is just the same. 

I had to put in nearly 2 litres of oil before I started it. That 
engine rebuild to replace the cracked crankcase is going to happen 
sooner rather than later. The bus is due for its annual registration 
this month, so rather than pay the rego now and not use the bus 
for a couple of months, I'm going to take it off the road and start 
on the rebuild. I'll re-register it after I've got the engine done.

That'll be a good test of my new shed as well as my resolve,
as we're heading into winter here in Orange. Orange is one of the 
colder places in this State during winter, nothing compared to a lot 
of North America and Europe, but cool enough to make it necessary to 
have something more than warm clothes on when working in a shed at 
night. I'm planning on some sort of wood heater eventually but a 
little fan heater might have to do this winter.

For the rebuild, I hope to use a case that I salvaged from a Type 
3 1600 engine I bought at an auction (along with a whole lot of VW 
stuff I got for A$10). If the case checks out OK, I'll get it align 
bored and modified to take the bigger 1776 barrels. So when I've 
finished I'll have effectively rebuilt the bottom end with new 
bearings, etc. 

Actually, it'll be interesting to pull the engine down to see how 
everything else is going. Last time I had it checked by my mechanic, 
the #3 plug was fouled, which indicated oil was getting past the 
rings. I haven't been able to check if it's burning oil because of 
the amount of oil that leaks out of the crankcase crack.

Regards,


Ian
