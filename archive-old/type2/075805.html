Subject: Re: [T2] '76 FI engine?

H Steven Dolan sends:

&gt; The second best (and much easier) way to tell is to pop the valve covers
&gt; off one fine morning and have a look at the gaps.  Basically, check the
&gt; gap on all your valves.  If none of them have any gap, then you have
&gt; hydraulic lifters.  If any have *some* gap, then you have solids.

That is, unless a PO didn't realize there were hydraulics in the engine, or
know there is a difference between a solid-lifter engine and a hydraulic-
lifter engine, and set the gap like it was a solid lifter engine. I have
seen people do this. &quot;I set my valves to .006&quot; like it says in Muir, and now
my engine runs like crap. Any ideas?&quot; Yeah. Read the whole book.
