Subject: Re: [T2] Re: DP to SP conversion 

A SP has better low end torque....just what a bus needs.
A DP has better top end....just what a light beetle needs.

In the USA, 71 buses were the last of the upright 1600's. 
They were SP.....

&gt; I see all this talk of converting from DP to SP. I hope this is not a stupid
&gt; question but why would one want to convert from DP to SP. I always thought
&gt; that DP was an improvement over SP.
