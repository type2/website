&gt; Well, folks, I just got the nastiest e-mail I have ever received. I don't

one person does not a list make.

&gt; I am unsubscribing.

please don't go, your input has been usefull...if all the decent folks
leave all that will be left is the _at_#*&amp;$


I have been reading these posts with much deja vu, I own a small business
(not VW related) and am celebrating my 25 anniversary this year, but 10
years ago my wife was diagnosed with cancer, and 8 years ago yesterday she
died,  I can assure you that my business was the last thing on my
mind..only by the grace of God, good help, and an understanding customer
base did I (just barely) survive.

I don't know Dawn, don't have a Westy so doubt I will use her services,
but the Golden Rule (no not &quot;he who has the gold rules&quot;) comes into play,
from the messages recieved she is going through some personal crisis.  

there are several secnarios that could play out

1.  she gets over the crisis and has enough resources to pull things back
together.  
1A. she gets over the crisis and is able to pull things back together but
because of the &quot;Bad press&quot; she gets no further orders and bags it

2.  she gets over the crisis but does not have the resources to pull
things back together, so she folds her tent and finds otheremployment

3.  she doesn't get over the crisis, folds her tent and goes home

4.  the ^%$_at_#* she gets from her customers over her failure to put
business over her family causes her to say &quot;to hell withem&quot; and folds her
tent

5.  the #_at_$*&amp; she gets added to the presure of the crisis causes her to
&quot;Check out&quot; and take the &quot;Josh Rogers&quot; route


each one must make a choice where to go, I have been on both sides of
possibly ever one of the options there is no right answer....(OK I didn't
check out, but I sure thought about it once or twice)

let us consider the spirit of the season, there apppears to be some
contact from someone close to her,  I would say &quot;give her a break&quot;  what
she probably needs more than anything is someone to

send her a check for a job and a note saying &quot;I know you have problems
right now but I'm not in a hurry try getting it to me by summer at the
latest&quot;
