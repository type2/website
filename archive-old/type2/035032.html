Subject: Auxillary power system questions

I recently installed a group 27 deep cycle battery in my camper. It is 
wired on the discharge end to a nice panel I bought at West Marine that 
has three fused and LED-lighted switches, a fused 12v socket, and a 
two-battery meter. (29.95)

On the charging side I wired in a solenoid from Camping World; the 
charging wiring from the alternator (at the starting battery + post) to 
the solenoid, the solenoid to the aux battery, and the negative aux post 
to the bus body are all 2 gauge battery cable. The third terminal is 
wired to the coil. When I turn the key, I hear a satisfying clunk from 
the solenoid.

But doesn't that mean that I getting some drain on the aux battery when 
I run the starter? I don't think I want that.

Second question: I have an unregulated 1.5 amp Sears battery charger. I'd 
like to install it permanently in the charging circuit, to keep the aux 
battery topped up whenever I am plugged in to &quot;shore power.&quot; But I don't 
want to take the risk of overcharging. Without adding a regulator to the 
circuit, is it fair to estimate that I can have the charger plugged in 
for an hour for every 1.5 amp hours I draw from the system? Can I use a 
rude calculation like that without risking an overcharge?

Thanks for the help.
