If the tent is in good shape and has everything that a good price the
cheapest that I have seen them was $500.  My opinion  is buy the tent you
can always get your money back.  They are hard to come by

&gt; I've been looking at a '72 Westy.  The dude has a drive-away tent in good
&gt; shape, but he is asking $600 extra for it.  Is this too much or about
right?
&gt;
&gt; Also- I've been trying to find a newer-model tent for the Westy, a modern
&gt; side tent or van tent.  I have yet to find anything other than the awnings
&gt; on gowesty_dot_com.  Any ideas???
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Wade
