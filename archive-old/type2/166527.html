Subject: Re: Getting the Bus back on the road...

 &gt; Anything else I'm missing?

Yes. The brakes. Chances are that it is mostly still original. I have 
replaced the brake hoses (looked ok but over 30 years old!) and rear 
wheel cylinders (leaking) on my bus. The front pads were worn 
unevenly on one side in my bus so I assume one of the pistons was 
stuck. I had a play at freeing it by putting a new pad in the good 
side and the worn pad in the stuck side and repeatedly applying the 
brakes and using the worn pad to lever the piston back in. I know, I 
should take them apart and do the job properly.

You also need to check the adjustment of the rear brakes and the handbrake.
