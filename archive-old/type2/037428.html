Subject: *&amp;%$ exhaust stud

I've been trying for the last 2 evenings to remove one of my exhaust port
studs.  At the moment one of my heat exchangers is held on by 3 nuts.  It
all started last week (screen goes wobbly) when I was R&amp;R-ing my exhaust to
get it to seal properly.  One of the studs came out with the nut rusted on
so I figured I would just put it back in like that.  However, the stud had
other ideas and when it was halfway in the nut started to turn.  Trouble is,
there is no thread left to grab hold of and the stud is stuck tight.  Does
anyone have any tips as to how to get it out, given the limited access
(preferably without taking the heat exchanger off _again_).  So far I have
tried gluing a nut to it (ha ha), vise grips and cutting a screwdriver slot
in it with a Dremel (screwdriver blade snapped).
