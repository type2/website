Subject: [T2] RE:appraisals and showcars

&gt;i agree, a showpiece car is nice to look at, but i
&gt;tend to like the advice my uncle gave me once.   

&gt;&quot;its just no fun to own it if you don't put itsideways
&gt;once in a while.&quot;

     I remember reading in one of those hot rod magazines about a guy who 
was asked if his original Shelby Cobra could be tested on the track for 
their magazine.  He stunned them by simply driving the quarter million 
dollar thing from Texas to California through rainstorms and everything 
(it has no roof).  He answered their shock by simply saying &quot;If I wanted 
a flowerpot, I'da bought me a flowerpot.  I wanted a car, and cars are 
fer drivin'.&quot;

     I think most of us with 20-30 year old buses can understand. Mine, 
though, is a &quot;seasonal&quot; daily driver-  I'll walk before I drive it over a 
salted road! 

     Mine is a '78 and in answer to another poster's query, my old 
insurance company told me not to bother insuring an old Volkswagen.  I 
found another insurance company who sent me to their appraiser who 
valuated it at $9000.  It is a plain interior transporter, but it has no 
rust and this is the Northeast.  I too am lamenting the increasing values 
of these things.  My first bus cost me $200 and I sure didn't pay $9000 
for this one, but you can bet I insured it for the full amount!
