Subject: RE: [T2] In-Dash Tunes

Woah, thanks for all the help.  I have to save up money of course, and fix the more immediate problems, but this is a project to put the finishing touches on my bus (a 71 westy) that I'm really looking forward to.  I think by the end of this year I should have it done, probably...(I have to figure out what's wrong with my rear breaks, but that's a different email, get some major body work done, then repaint (and the paint job on it now is brand new!  but the body work will mean I have to get it re-done), get a new turn signal switch (mine smokes when teh key is on, so it's sitting in the driveway now), fix the trans and get new curtains and seat covers for teh back, as well as teh two canvas beds, and it's all done)
