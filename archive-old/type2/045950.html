Subject: [T2] Carb Jets

I picked up an almost like new carb,
Solex, Made in Brazil, size H30/31PICT.

Using it to do some study, and snooping,
and in looking at the main jet, I see &quot;120&quot; stamped on the thing.

Looking at a Haynes manual under Chapter 3,
I see the following jet and carb relationships listed.

30 PICT 1; Main Jet  = 120
30 PICT 2; Main Jet  = x116
30 PICT 3; Main Jet  = x112.5
34 PICT 3; Main Jet  = x125, x125

Specifically, what do these numbers actually record.
Jet size, as a function of what, orifice diameter, or something else ?
Or just a size reference number with no correlation to anything

What does the &quot;x&quot; prefix mean on the three sizes shown?

Today, I am replacing a .009 distributor in Casper with a vacuum 
advance unit.
Gonna see if I can improve his 19 mpg, so as to get closer to NewBus's 
25 mpg.

After that, if needed, I will start looking to carburetor jets as an 
mpg improvement,
but think I need to get a bit more knowledge in my belt before I go 
that direction via hit and miss.

Thanks for reading,

Bob Perring
