Subject: shaky tach

I recently added some gauges to my 1980 westy 2.0 aircooled: Tach, oil
pressure and oil temperature.

They all are working but the tach is kind of erratic, like it is getting
spikes on the signal or something. Any ideas, could I add a capacitor
shunted to ground to smooth that out, if so about what value? Could it
be a sign my condenser is bad? Points look ok.

Bye the way thanks to the list for the tips about the oil temp sender
unit  on the taco plate went smooth no leaks used a new O ring

Gary
