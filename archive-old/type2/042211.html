Subject: Rear engine compartment panel

Hey folks,

	I bought a new engine compartment seal for my '71 buss since the
old one was cracked and falling apart.  When I went to install it I noticed
that the rear engine compartment panel didn't mate flush with the side
panels; it slants down toward the engine at a smaller angle than the side
panels, leaving a big gap between the two.  Is this gap normal?  It looks
like the PO replaced the rear engine compartment panel after a fender
bender.  Do different year busses have slightly different rear panels?  By
the way, in case I'm using the wrong term, the panel I'm talking about is
the one you would rest your hand, tools, beer, etc. while working on the
engine.

Thanks for any suggestions,
Adam Rechs
