&gt;What is the downside of 79's? i understand tha the 77's don't have 
&gt;Hydraulic lifters, but i was under the impression that 78/79's were 
&gt;pretty much the same???

Drew,

I know you got several responses to this already, because most
of them were copied to me.  However, I want to reiterate that the
79 exhaust issue is SIGNIFICANT.  David Schwarze said, &quot;not
insurmountable, but significant&quot;.  I think that is an understatement.

My &quot;friend&quot; whom I mentioned in my original post had a 79, and he
searched high and low for exhaust parts.  Could NOT find them.
Absolutely none of the repro-parts sellers have any of the OEM-style
exhaust pieces, and VWoA just laughs at you.  Your only, only, ONLY
option is to use the repro stuff sold as &quot;fits 72-74, 79-83&quot;.  But as
mentioned, these systems don't accept catalytic converters.  If you're
in a state that checks for it, you're hosed (my friend was).

And heater boxes, as Ron Salmon pointed out, are a one-year-only item.
In fact, the way Bentley reads, they weren't even produced for a whole
model year, but maybe only 9 months.  I can't imagine retooling a whole
production line for that!  VWAG must have been asleep at the wheel, is
all I can figure.  You know they were already retooling for the Vanagons
in 79, in fact, I think some 79 model-year Vanagons were actually sold
in Europe.  The only sensible thing to do would have been to use the
same parts on the 79 US bus, but no, they didn't do that.

Take care,
Rodney
