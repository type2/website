Hello.

I changed the front seats in my '78 Westy to Vanagon bucket seats.  Very 
comfortable.

I also CONVERTED my rear Z-bed 2/3 seat, using the Vanagon middle 2/3 seat.  
I found some material at Wal-Mart to make a slip over cover for the cushion 
over the engine compartment, and for the bolster on the side of the seat.  
Everything matches.  It was easy, and I would be glad to explain what I did 
off-line.

My 'Vanagon' rear Z-bed seat STILL folds out 'flat-ish' so that I can have a 
flat area in back, and I can get to the area under the Z-bed (heck, maybe I 
should start calling it a V-bed!!) the same.

The V-bed rear seat is also very comfortable, and I have a middle seat arm 
rest for when I get two kids back there, and I need to establish 
territories.

Why I say all this??

Last Saturday, I came across a full set of really clean Vanagon seats, blue 
in color, that could probably be had for reasonable $$$ at a local junk 
yard, Washington DC area.

A lot of outside of the area people might be coming to the 14-17 Sep campout 
in Assateque (my spelling), and if you ever thought about doing something 
like that to your Westy, these might be a good set of seats.

I know my phone number might be long distance for many of you all, but if 
you get  DIALPAD  like my wife had me do, you could call from your  geeky 
computer to most any USA phones for free.

PS.  I am upset.  I, personally, feel like the guys and gals in a 100 mile 
radius area (Pentagon = traditionally GROUND ZERO) do NOT do enough for each 
other.  I expressed my upsetness before, and I just thought I would blow off 
again..
