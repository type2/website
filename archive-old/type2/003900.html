On 'a' series Austin engines, there is a similar set-up of piston &amp; spring.
They are always sticking open also.

The way we get around this problem is to find a ball bearing of
_EXACTLY_ the same diameter as the piston &amp; replace it with this ball
bearing, also CHANGE THE SPRING at the same time. As the ball has no edges,
nothing can obstruct it's path.

I can not be certain of the oil galleries in your engine, but this works for
me.
