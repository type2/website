Subject: 71 bus for sale

I have a 71 weekender for sale. Drives great. Drivetrain good, all major bugs worked out. Many new parts, brakes, tires, battery. Needs paint, has some surface rust, rusty corner at battery. Daily driver. Western North Carolina. Gotta have $1500, much more invested. Would consider trade for pickup of equal value. Contact me at vwbaybug_at_yahoo_dot_com
