Subject: Clacking motor 

List,

I posted a while ago about MSHP being dead on the vine (with my motor inside
his shop).  All signs point to &quot;yes&quot; on this problem.  Thanks for responses
and suggestions.  The motor in the &quot;other&quot; '78 crapped out in an
interesting way I'm having trouble diagnosing.  Any BTDTs, guesses, etc.??

Bus is '78 FI, 2 liter with 150k miles.  Very good starting, power and
passed emission test a few months back. I was driving the bus at 25 mph
and hear a &quot;clunk&quot; followed by increasingly louder &quot;clacking&quot; sounds.
Pull over and towed it home.  Bus starts right up, loud clacking seems to 
come from right head.  All valves seem loose (stock hydraulic) except one
on the left head.  Pulled all plugs and compression test is 110 in all 
except #4 which is 90 (left, rear cylinder).  With the plugs out cranking 
the motor for compression test sounds just fine--clacking gone.  Going to
clean plugs and see if it was a collapsed lifter.  Anybody else been down 
this road?  Next step?  I'm hoping I can figure out a limping fix while I
try to retrieve my motor from MSHP (stop laughing!).

Thanks for any help,
