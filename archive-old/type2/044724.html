&gt; Nikki.... something ya haven't said that you have checked... the central ideling valve... that big electromagnetic one on the left carb... controls idle for both carbs, that and the honk'n brass screw on the top front(FIF) of the left carb.... I had mine go bad one me without any notice... follow the procedures to test... pull the wire and listen for the click....
 
Good to know the test. I wiggled the connection on that solenoid last
night, and it seemed a little better today. Turns out the stalling
actually occurs not after sitting for a minute, but when starting out in
1st gear.

While she's in the shop, the mechanic promised to upgrade all my engine
wiring connections, because they're all really funky and sloppy. It was
a project I was going to do (real soon now), but she's there and they
might as well. For example, looking at the old solenoid, the connection
had a big gob of solder on it. The threads were stripped on the old carb
where the solenoid went in. Nasty!

My PO mechanic-hopped. I'm not going to make that mistake.
