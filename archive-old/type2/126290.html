&lt;&lt; Just try not
&gt; to pay German prices for lesser parts. Make sure you compare apples to
&gt; apples and not turnips.

also though on the other side of the coin do you really need parts to
.0001 tolerances or will .001 work just as well, big difference in cost

'Fraid even German prices for German parts won't cut it...Witness the
680,000 vehicle recall (including the Maybach) by Mercedes-Benz for
failures in their &quot;nothing short of revolutionary&quot; electrohydraulic
braking system... ;-(
