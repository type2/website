Subject: Re: [T2] Rat motor 

Ahhhh now that takes me back... Chevelle SS. Circa 1967-8

Mouse motor = small block Chevrolet. 265, 283, 327, 350 c.i.
Rat Motor = big block Chevrolet. 396, 427.
Crate motor = A new engine from the dealership. Targetmaster 
replacement motor.  At $1250 a new 350 four bolt main Targetmaster 
motor was a steal. Available at your local Chevy dealer's parts 
counter.  Larger dealerships had them in stock. The 427 crate motor was 
a bit more... ($4k) and usually special order.

Rat motor was predominately used to describe the 396. Mouse motor the 
350.

A comparison for T2 purposes would be the type1 motor which be the 
equivalent of a mouse motor and the type4 motor that would be the 
equivalent of a rat motor. Especially around 1970-72.  1600 to 1700, 
only a hundred cc's but completely different engines.

(See George! I got type 2 content in there. ;o) )

&gt; I think maybe between the hot-rod and bus it is two entirely different
&gt; things unless the rod was not pretty looking. Rat is sometimes used for
&gt; type of built engine, mouse is also used, along with crate. Just
&gt; different ways of describing a certain motor. I don't exactly know what
&gt; a Rat motor is per se besides usually custom built. Crate motors are
&gt; just bought from a catalog like Jegs and then you open the crate and
&gt; drop the motor in. Go to Chevy Hi Performance's website and check out
&gt; the articles they have on Rat motors.
