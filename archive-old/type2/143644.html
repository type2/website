Now I remember!  Those were stock on the 1964 Westy, Surrealist Edition -- the
one that was commissioned to commemorate Salvador Dali's 60th birthday!  Very
fun to drive, if I do recall correctly.  NOS dashboard clocks for that model
are an especially rare find, since installed units had a tendency to elongate
and flex during long trips.
