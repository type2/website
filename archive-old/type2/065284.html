Subject: re: stuck in hi/low beam

As this has caused a buzz on the net I thought I would make what happened to me 
a general post.

My lights got stuck in dipped, played with the switch then they got stuck
in high so had to fix it.

I changed the relay but it made no difference.

Took the lighting switch apart - nearly lost the little spring - put it back 
together (eventualy).

Checked the wiring and found that where the switch connects to the loom that 
the male/female connector had come apart inside of the connector block. BINGO!
Works fine now....

This doesn't mean that relay never fails but check the connector before buying
a new one!


Bob.
