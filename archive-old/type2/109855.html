Subject: Re: [T2] Re:liquid repair for loose ball joints?

Hello Mike    Are you NUTS  Have you ever seen or had a ball jt come out on 
you It isn't real fun. wheel just folds under and the bus goes where it wants. 
Very dangerous. I had a link pin break on my 63 single cab , very hard to do  
these things are almost 2 inches in diameter! Bus slide up to a big sign pole 
and bent the mirror, didn't hit the truck got real lucky. had to get out on 
the passenger side. Just fix these the right way and be safe. Later and have fun
