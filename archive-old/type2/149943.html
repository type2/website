Subject: Re: 68 Truck Paint Codes

Hi every one I am now finailly getting started on
 the 68. I am working on a 68
 dropgate truck and was wondering which white was
 used on this one. The truck
 was white and blue. I want to keep this as close as
 possible. John Bybee,

L87   Pearl White ( to 218-059-924) for the bumpers and wheels
L282  Lotus White ( to 218-059-936) for the body. These didn't come with any
two-tones, only one tone because they were commercial vehicles.

You can check other colors at

Good to see more Double Cab lovers!!! Call me if you need 68 parts, I have a
few extras to share!
