Subject: Re: [T2] type 1 into a 73

So did you seal up the engine so it doesn't cook itself and how are you
hangint the weight of the engine so the two small tranny bolts don't break
off sending the engine and tranny to the ground?


&gt;Update:
&gt;Trimmed the input shaft, changed the trowout bearing and it went right
&gt;in. Runs good and drives great.
&gt;This is not near as hard a project as some had made me beleive!
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for all the tips,

&gt;&gt; &gt; Ok, I have my friend's 73 bus in the driveway. He took the 1700
&gt;&gt; out
&gt;&gt; &gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt; is tryiiing to put a type 1 engine into it.  We have everything
&gt;&gt; &gt; lined up
&gt;&gt; &gt; but cant get the engine all the way on to the tranny.
&gt;&gt; &gt; What are we missing?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; the engine came out of a 71 bus.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; &gt; Ed
