Hi all,

Just wanted to exress my feelings on being so far away from my VW's.  I
hope everyone will get a chance to get out on a nice two laner this weekend
and enjoy a cool breeze while listening to the perfectly tuned hum of their
VW's.  I miss mine so much that sometimes I want to pack my bags, fly back
to the states, jump in my 78 camper and hit the woods.  I NEED A FIX!

Have you ever gotten a job for someone you met on the type2 list?
Like...say...someone with 5 years in Television Production, tracking
missiles, documentary photography, and digital imaging who has

spent enough time in paradise and wants to get back to the states to eat
Taco Bell, see a baseball game, hug a tree with real leaves,

drive a VW, eat good chinese, watch real tv, go to a movie theater with a
roof, hug my dog, camp, Mcdonalds, seasons, mountains

(hell,just give me a hill), a creek, Mom, have a choice in B-B-Q sauces,
get junk mail, a call from someone who wants to help me save on long
distance phone calls, take my grandmother for a walk, hear a horn honk,
read a billboard, survive a DUI checkpoint, get gas at one of those
stations with the quick-pay pump thingys, have a domino's dude show up late
with a cold pizza, dirt, go to a VW shop and see &quot;what I can't live
without&quot;, watch a football game with dad, drink an unexpired can of soda,
see an awful band in a smokey bar,

wear a jacket...long pants would feel pretty neat too, decide which golf
course to play, see what's new at the mall, get pissed at the

traffic, good B-B-Q...really good B-B-Q...

Ok, I'm gonna go cry now...
