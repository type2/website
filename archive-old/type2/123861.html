Subject: Re: [T2] just purchased a 70 Bus and have some questions

&gt; And like someone said before I am a novice at this, I had a bug about 15 
&gt; years ago, but never really did anything to it. My goal is to learn how to 
&gt; do all this repairs myself one day, but for now I'm going to need some 
&gt; help.

I find it really touching and refreshing to see someone new coming into a 
hobby that is fast diminishing.
