Chris,

I am not saying you don't and I am not saying you do, but all bay window
buses, from 68 on, had one when they left the factory.  The gas tank vents
on either side run to the back, then into the small tube on the charocal
canister.  It is an oval can about 4cm thick, 15cm wide and 40cm tall.
There will be one small hose that connects to the gas tank vents and two
big hoses, one from the fan shroud, one to the air filter.
