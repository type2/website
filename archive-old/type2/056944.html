Subject: Report of my first trip in '76

Much ado about trip reports on the vintagebus list a few days back may 
have inspired me to take my first trip in my '76. It has been sitting in 
my garage bay since 3 July, the day I bought it. I have been working on 
the interior -- camperizing it in a combination of Devon and Westfalia 
cabinets. But I need to trade the dual carbs for FI to smog it, put on 
some tin, and countless other tasks. Including, since the day after I got 
it home, get it to start. I would turn the key and nothing would happen 
except the brake light and the battery light would come on. Since the 
beams dimmed when I turned the key, I figured it was the battery.

So yesterday I swapped the Interstate battery from my S**b into the bus. 
Nothing. Crawled under and gave the starter a tap with a mallet. Nothing. 
Frustrated, I gave the key one last exasperated turn. It needed the 
exasperation (something Bentley doesn't tell you). The bus started right 
up! (Obviously a bad starter switch. A low priority for repair as 
exasperation seems to do the trick every time).

The 2.0 liter sounded so nice that I decided that I would take the bus 
out for its first road trip (it arrived on the hook of a wrecker). Needed 
to do two things first: get a gallon of gasoline and a container to put 
it in (no needle on the gas guage) and pump up two tires. The gas went 
fine, but my foot pump gave up at about 30 psi. Good enough. I fired it 
up, let it warm for a minute or two, and backed out. Put it in first. It 
is geared awfully tall -- shake rattle and roll when I let out the 
clutch. Tried to get it rolling in 2nd and that worked. Pulled away, and 
down the north-facing driveway. People are looking at me. Are they 
waving? No, they're skittering to get children and pets out of the way!

At the end of the first driveway I turn left at the main drive. I've gone 
.03 miles and so far everything is holding up. I break for a speedbump. 
Screech. Oh. Nothing left on at least one set of brakepads. I make a 
note. On past two more speedbumps and right. Right again, onto a 
straightaway at the edge of the complex. I'm thinking I might get to 
shift up to 3rd here, put no soap on the big board: there's a nasty 
drainage dip that sends everything inside caterwoling. Easy... Right 
again. I head back to my garage bay, which is exactly 2&quot; wider than the 
bus from side mirror to side mirror. To get in, I have to use 1st, and I 
succeed. I pull to a stop. Screech. Set the handbrake, and turn off the 
motor.

Now the big test -- I throw open the engine hatch and wait 90 seconds. No 
sign of fire.

Total distance traveled: .18 miles by the odometer (which may or may not 
be accurate).

Oh lucky man, he who has a type2! The freedom!! The joie de vivre!!!

And I couldn't have done it without this list.
