Subject: '72 Accelerator Cable Q
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hey Fellow V-Dubbers,

    No help from my manuals or the archives on this one, so here goes....
    My accelerator cable and linkage on my 72 Campmobile has got me
confused.  The end that goes through the cylinder with the set screw is
HUGE!   Like four or five times as big around as all other V-Dubs I've
worked on (this is my first bus, though).   Oh yeah, and the set screw?
There isn't one.   In fact there's not even a hole for one in the cylinder.
When I bought it, it had a spring connected to the cable (through a small
hole in the shaft) and then connected to the top of the engine
compartment.... this operates as the throttle return.   I went to my FLAPS
and ordered a new cable (thinking what I had was somebody's quick fix) and
the one I got won't fit it.   It has a closed end where it should connect to
the  pedal, and there's no way to attach it.  The shaft end is the small
kind (like I'm used to) but the cylinder for this size would never stay in
the throttle linkage because it's small.
    Do the 72's have a different cable/set-up than others?   Or has mine
been really screwed up by a PO?
    One more thing, it looks like I can't remove the old one without just
cutting the cable.  The ring on the pedal end is too big to pull through the
tubing, and the shaft at the carburetor end is too big to pull through it,
too.  How in the world did they get this thing on here in the first place?
    It's working the way it is now, but I have a lot of play before the
cable engages the linkage, so I really only have about half throttle.  The
only thing that keeps the shaft from pulling out of the cylinder is the bent
piece of wire that runs through the hole in the shaft from the spring.

    I hope that made sense....
    I'd appreciate any help you might have to offer me on this one....
you've been great in the past.... and maybe someday I'll finally be smart
enough to do some answering rather than questioning!
