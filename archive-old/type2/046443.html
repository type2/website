Subject: [T2] Axle weights

Hi again, it's Mick,
I'm persevering with the Michelin Classics, 185 R14 C, - 8 ply (1875 lbs.)
vs. 6 ply (1540 lbs.).
Michelin need the individual  axle weights front and rear to give accurate
pressure recommendations.
The bus is a 'Standard'  Westfalia if there is such a thing- 5 seat, 5 bed,
coolbox, wardrobe, tables etc.
It weighed 1.34 tonne total.
Does anyone have even a rough idea of the individual axle weights so I can
at least start running at more realistic tyre pressures ?
Cheers
