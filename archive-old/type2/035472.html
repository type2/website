Subject: RE: Electric fan cooling, insulation in plastic bags

	[Crick, Bill ]  Regarding the electric cooling fans. If the stock
fan uses 
	7Hp not that 7hp _at_12v is 521 amps (assuming 83% efficient motor)
	  
	About the insulation in plastic bags. I'd  be very wary of this. Any
condensation
	will tend to occur between the plastic bag, and the outside metal
skin of the
	van, which sounds like a sure rust problem. Especially given my
experience that anywhere
	plastic or rubber touch metal is a likely origin point for rust.
First rule of insulation is
	most vapor proof layer has to be on the warm side, so any vapor that
gets into the insulation
	can get out on the cold side. Unfortunately the skin of the van is
quite vapor proof.



	Water vapor in air on warm side

	_______________ Vapor barrier

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Insulation
	----------------------------  Permeable layer on cold side
	Cold side
	   

	As the water vapor moves through the insulation it gets colder, and
colder 
	and at some point it condenses. You need to stop this from happening
by
	blocking the vapor where it is too warm to condense, 
	hence the vapor barrier on the inside. Any that does  get through
needs
	a chance to evaporate, and escape to the outside
	If you put your insulation in bags, the moist are seeps around the
bag, and
	when it gets between the bag, and the outside wall it condenses,
leaving you with 
	water trapped on the inside of the van skin, and the bag keeps it in
there so it
	can't evaporate
