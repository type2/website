Subject: RE: [T2] Stolen Bus

Hey Kurt,

Sorry about your bus man.  That really sucks.  I live in the greater
Portland area and commute up and down 99w and I-5 regularly.  I see
buses all the time and will absolutely keep an eye out for yours.
You state that it is blue and a 72.  Is it completely blue? or two
tone with the VW white upper?  I'm ignorant when it comes to the
various camper terms for buses, so Campmobile does little to help me
atm, though by the time anyone reads this post I will probably be
fully educated on what a Campmobile looks like.  Does it have a
Westfalia type top on it?  And if it does, does it hinge forward or
rear?  Or does it pop straight up?  Does it still have a VW emblem
on the front?  or do you normally carry a spare on the front.  Are
there any tell-tale cosmetics?  Large stickers or even sizeable rust
spots that would be visible to anyone driving by this bus?  I will
keep an eye out, but I need to know more about what I am looking
for... Blue campmobile helps but do you have more specifics?  You
see,.. one of the advantages of me driving my standard, station
wagon model bus is that it gives me more glass to watch for your
stolen bus with  :)
Let me know...
