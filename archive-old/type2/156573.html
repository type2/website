Subject: Re: [T2] brake lights?

&gt; Hi there,
&gt; I have a '73 westy and the only way to get the
&gt; brakelights to come on is to
&gt; step on the brakes hard enough to lock up the
&gt; brakes.I put new switches on the
&gt; master cylinder about 1/2 a year ago.
&gt; Has anyone else had this problem? Any ideas?
&gt;
The word I got from Aircooled.Net was that the
replacement switches are not very reliable and to use
my old ones if they still work. That said, here's what
is likely happening:
The switches use hydraulic pressure to close the
switch. If there is an air bubble, the air is
compressible and the bubble will compress before there
is any mechanical movement of the switch. Some people
&quot;fill&quot; the switch before assembly to minimize air
bubbles, then leave the switch loose enough that the
loose connection becomes a blleder opening, thus
giving the ability to bleed the air out. Yes, we are
talking about a very tiny amount of air!

Knowing that I didn't want to spend a bunch of time
lying on the ground in the rain fixing this problem
with an uncertain success liklihood, I opted for a
mechanical brakelight switch under the brake pedal
arm, under the floorboard. The brakelight switch
wiring passes right by there and it is easy to splice
the switch in, leaving the original wiring and
switches in case I decide to go back to stock at a
later date. Since my bus is my daily driver, it was
the most sensible thing for me to do.

The switches are commonly available at FLAPS. Mine
cost under $10.00 and has been 100% reliable. -BaH
