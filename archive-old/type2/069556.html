Subject: Re: Heads/GEX SAGA

OK, I throw my .0000002 cents worth into this thread.

Have a '67 Deluxe 21 Window (Original Owner - Purchased new June 67) with
307,000 miles on it.  On its 4th Engine with about 30K on it.  It's a GEX
Rebuild.  Nary a problem with it.  Previous engines were ones I built (when I
had more time on my hands).  Didn't get any special treatment, just because I
know Larry personally, just grabbed an engine &quot;off the rack&quot; so to speak.

I grew up in the East San Gabriel Valley, just down the road from GEX, so
I've had dealings with Larry on and off for at least 18 years.  They've had
their ups and downs, some their fault and some not their fault.  I wouldn't
have bought a GEX motor during some time periods of their manufacturing
quality (or lack thereof during those periods).

Although not scientifically done or proven, I've kinda kept track of the
hundreds of people that have called to discuss GEX engines/service/quality
they have had over the past 5 years.  Most I have talked to have indicated
they were pleased with their product and would recommend them again.  There
of course were a few that felt GEX's quality wasn't quite up to snuff and
I've noted their comments as well.  One of the most respected Independent VW
Mechanics in Redding is sharp, very sharp (Over 20 years in the biz - little
hole in the wall, but clean and professional) and has told me that most of
his engine jobs are GEX's and has had very little problem in quality and if
there was a problem warranty service has never been a hassle at all.  In
speaking with him yesterday concerning this thread, he mentioned that the
last time he had a problem with a GEX engine was about 2 years ago and he
basically serves the local folk here, with occasional type 2 vacationer.
 There's alot of VWs in Redding enduring triple digit heat from June to
September (it's 106F today).  In fairness, he won't recommend a complete
engine if just the top end is fouled up.  He'll do the dirty work to replace
cylinders and heads if that's all he feels the engine needs and his rates and
prices are very fair compared to some of the other shysters in Shasta County
I've dealt with since moving from L.A. 3 years ago.  Alas, he is retiring
this week, closed the business and is moving to Oklahoma next week.  Too bad.
 He did a wonderful engine job on my 80 Vanagon last week and his last job
was to finish a Genuine (not repro) Porsche 550.  Gawd, what a beaut of a
car.  Loud too with the original exhaust, 2 distributors, 4 cams, etc.  In
talking with the owner of the car, he said that this guy was the only person
north of the Bay Area he would trust to finish the mechanicals on this
restoration project (owner is out of Northern Oregon somewhere).
