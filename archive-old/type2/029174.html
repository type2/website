Hi i am from Trukey and this is my first message. I am on the edge of
buying a 1972 bus westfalia camper with pop top, inside equipment all
original...
The price is around 5000$  the car have no rust no accidents no cracks in
any window..no paint problem, engine is at 30,000 km and its the second
engine..i mean rebuilt...

The thing is that there is  fridge, cooker but no sink and water pump,
there is no city water connection as well of course..
How can i purchase the original ones...? Any idea?

Also the louvre windows, i loved them when i saw their picture, but the car
that i am seeking does not have it ..

Please does anyone have any second hand and wanna sell?
thx a lot
sincerely,

EMRE TOK
