modified comparison list from my ex-wife:


I see you don't get out much either.
 .Well, let's see.

Indoors                        Outdoors
comfortable chair         no chair
good desk lamp             bright sunlight
climate control             uncontrolled climate
coffee machine            no coffee machine
coke machine               no coke machine
telephone                    no telephone (hey that might be a plus)
e-mail                         no e-mail
internet access            no internet access

what would the perfect combination be, I wonder?...

Westy
comfortable seating
excellent lighting
modifiable climate
coffee on hand
coke in the cooler
telephone on hand
e-mail if you spring for a cellular modem
