Subject: Re: [T2] Charcoal Canister

&gt; &gt; what year did this start? i dont have anything with charcoal in it on my
&gt; &gt; bus~'71
&gt;
&gt; I am not saying you don't and I am not saying you do, but all bay window
&gt; buses, from 68 on, had one when they left the factory.  The gas tank vents
&gt; on either side run to the back, then into the small tube on the charocal
&gt; canister.  It is an oval can about 4cm thick, 15cm wide and 40cm tall.
&gt; There will be one small hose that connects to the gas tank vents and two
&gt; big hoses, one from the fan shroud, one to the air filter.

Steve
I think you are wrong.
Ive had 2 68s and a 69 and none had charcoal systems. Im not sure
exactly when but it didnt start until at least 70.
