Subject: Re: [T2] Re; Parcel Trays

&lt;BTW, American Flyer sleds and wagons aren't made here either...&gt;

What's American any more? Even Harley's have parts made in China... We 
bought a &quot;Berlin Wagon&quot; made in Ohio in 2000... Real steering, 
pneumatic tires, stout enough to haul my backside + a couple kids. By 
the way this thing is WAY faster down the hills than my old hard rubber 
tire-d wagon with the stamped steel bottom from the 1950's. Fast enough 
it needs brakes... &lt;grin!&gt; Maybe once fuel gets up over $7 a gallon 
manufacturing will return to America, Wal-mart will tumble and fall, 
and all b/c it is too expensive to ship stuff from the orient. Return 
to local (few hundred miles away) production methods... Notice China 
and India are HUGE countries and on the verge of taking to the roads. 
More demand, limited fuel supply, price goes UP!

FWIW I still like to make my own stuff when I can. Chris
