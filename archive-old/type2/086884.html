and also there is the remote possibility that the engine was a transplant
from a 411/412 which was FI from 71-74 1700/1800cc   this will work I used
a 71-411 1700cc FI engine as backup for my 2L engine for my 78.  was
surprised but it was a straight bolt fit (automatic tranny)

&gt; &gt; To my knowledge all 74's came with a type4 1800 w/dual
&gt; &gt; carbs. Your FI 2.0 was not original equipment (U.S.A).
&gt; &gt; 74 1/2?
&gt; 
&gt; True, the 2.0L was not offered til 76. But not all 74's were dual carb. The
&gt; 1974 Calif version 1800 with auto trans came with FI. Very rare but
&gt; available....  Standard trans came with carbs.
&gt; 75 all states got FI.      *This applies to USA vehicles.*

&gt; &gt; I am haveing a serious problem.I have a 74 1/2 VW Van
&gt; &gt; that has been completely and loveingly restored for
&gt; &gt; my Wife and daughter to drive around in. The original
&gt; &gt; FI2.0l motor was blown and I have replaced it with a
&gt; &gt; 1978 FI2.0l engine. After much hardship ........
&gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;
