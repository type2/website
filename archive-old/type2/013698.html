Brand new to VWs.  I just bought a 78 transporter,
cheap.  Now I know why.  It had been sitting for 5 or
so years with no gas in the tank.  The mechanic
looking at it found the fuel filter jammed with rust. 
The tank probably is too. The mech said that removal
of engine is necessary to get to tank to take it out
to repair or replace.  Anybody care to confirm that? 
I do not want to screw up the FI by getting rust into
it.  

Any help is appreciated.

Kindest Regards,

Mark
