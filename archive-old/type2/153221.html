Subject: Re: Steelers view....

chai, I don't want to argue with you either. That's not 
what &quot;moonies&quot; are about. I just was upset the way you 
responded. You could have simply said, &quot;Keep it to Buses 
please.&quot; Instead of where's the bus content(with 20 ? 
marks)I was just excited that my team won. My heart goes 
three ways, MOSTLY my family, then my Bus and Steelers. I 
didn't shower the site all season. I simply put a reaction 
to the biggest game of the year. My bad. I didn't know the 
rules on the site. I apologize.

Have a Grateful day!
