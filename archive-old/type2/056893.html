Subject: RE: '68 Campmobile

Hi Mark;  

We bought an early production 1968 hardtop Campmobile in October 1978.  It had 
98,000 miles on it, an extremely tired original and unrebuilt engine full of 
thick black goo that was ultimately identified as &quot;oil&quot;, and had been parked 
in the weeds on a riverbank for a couple of years and used as a fishing shack.

When we sold it 6 years ago it had just under 300,000 miles on the odometer, 
143,000 miles on the latest rebuilt engine, a transaxle that shifted and 
operated just fine and had never been out of the vehicle since the bus was 
built, and rust under the windshield.

In between we drove and camped in it all over the Western and Southwestern US 
plus British Columbia and Alberta, Canada.  We miss it.  It was a faithful and 
reliable companion that never once stranded us away from home.
