I don't know about everyone else but the most indispensable tool I have for
my bus has got to be....

well I don't know what you would call it it's about two feet long and has a
button on one end and a flexible shaft for getting into those hard to reach
places (i.e. anywhere in engine compartment) and on the other end, when you
push the button, a 4 prong claw comes out so you can retrieve stuff from
places that it shouldn't be.  Such as nuts or washers under cooling tin.
