Subject: RE: [T2] LBC

Hey! I have a TR4A that I Vintage Race and Pull to the track with my 79 
Bay,and I'm thinking of putting a Bus dizzy on the TR.  I'll have to send a 
link of the tow bar I installed on my 79 Bay. I bought it from J C Wittney. 
It mounts to the frame and it is the strongest I have seen. When I get my 
card reader working I will send a link to the pics of the towing setup on my 
Bay. Cree 79 Bay
