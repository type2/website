Subject: backfires out right-hand carb
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.3.96.990302194917.11486B-100000_at_techsrv1.tech.mtu_dot_edu&gt;

I've got a 1977 2.0L engine with dual Weber 34ICT carbs.  The engine runs
great below 3,000 rpm, but when revved above 3,000 RPM the right carb will
bark and pop constantly.  (This is in neutral; haven't tried it on the
road yet.)  I've set the valves, synced the carbs, and set the timing;
nothing made much difference.  It only happens under steady throttle, and
only above 3,000...when you back off the throttle it stops backfiring
immediately.

Is this a symptom that the right carb is running lean?  Do I have a vacuum
leak or partially clogged main jet?  (The carbs sat for a while before I
got them.)  Or do I have (*cringe*) a valve problem?
