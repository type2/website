That's what I did : use both. Primarily because taking the other one
out is a pain :-)

But I haven't started the engine yet (soon soon soon soon....) so I
don't know if the slight difference in the position of the spark in
the chamber will do bad things.

&gt;-Should i put this one on the #3 cylinder, why not # 4 !!!

Apparently because #3 is the hottest one
