Subject: [T2] Vector-Based Bus images?

Hi Volks,

A while ago I posted the URL of an image I created of Denmeister's 74 Bus
using Adobe Illustrator.

If anyone else has line-art bus images, I'd be happy to hear from them... I
am specifically looking for profile shots of a Bay-window Bus, but since the
files are small and my pipe is large I could probably work with westy or
splitty pics if you have them. File format is not an issue, Autocad,
Coreldraw, Illustrator, Freehand or whatever would be welcome. Send them
direct to greg-potts_at_home_dot_com, or email me for an FTP address if you'd
rather move them that way.

Thanks,

Greg Potts
