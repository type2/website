&gt;I know this has probably been addressed before, but is there a way to install
&gt;a CHT probe without putting it under the spark plug.

I have carbs so I used the temp sender boss to attach the probes (one per side).  The readings are lower than under the plugs, but still useful.  Range is more like 200-300 degrees at the temp sender bosses.  I would like to find a better place to attach them, but haven't thought of anything yet.
