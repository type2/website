&gt;&gt; ----SNIP---I used commercial-strength toilet bowl cleaner to eat
&gt;&gt; away the rust.

&gt;&gt; I recommend sand blasting - much more friendly to mother earth -

&gt;Phosphoric acid (and for that matter other acids) tend to react with
&gt;other stuff pretty readily, which is why it's an effective cleaner.
&gt;When run down the drain it tends to get diluted pretty rapidly to safe
&gt;levels.

I would check into the safety of sandblasters, too. I always thought they
were pretty benign but recently we needed to clean a disassembled press,
with ink dried on it into a thick crust over the course of decades. Had a
sandblaster sent over from another plant to blast the crust off it.

When the guy in charge of OSHA compliance found out about the sandblaster
he went ape-sh*t. Wouldn't even let us start it up at all and made us get
it off the premises. Apparently the gubmint requires extensive respiration
apparutus and training for sandblasting because it plays hell with your
lungs. Who knew? 8) Sort of gave me a care for all the people on the list I
know who are always blasting buses...
