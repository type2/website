&gt;Hello all,
&gt;    Just got the drive plate off my old block and I'm in the process of

&gt;measure the end play without a dial gauge?

Yes, there is. You can use any flat metal stock, a bolt, 3 nuts, a few
washers and a feeler gauge to make an endplay measuring tool.

What you do is attach the flat metal stock to the bolt securely; then
attach the bolt to one of the engine-to-tranny mounting points; position
the metal over the flywheel (close but not touching); then measure the &quot;in
distance&quot; and the &quot;out distance&quot; of the flywheel to the metal bar. Use
basic math (subtraction) to calculate the difference and you have end play.

The trick is to get the right size metal stock (length-wise and wide enough
for your bolt), make sure it's straight, and make it mountable to the bolt
you use (e.g., drill a straight hole in the metal bar stock if you have to).

You're only talking about a few thousanths of an inch when you're looking
at end play. It's likely not going to be perceptable if you're *looking*
for movement. You can *feel* the movement of end play, but it's not enough
to really *see* it. You really should measure it, though. Someone may have
a drawing of the end play tool. I want to say I think there might be one in
Muir...but I might be wrong about that too.

Good luck! Joe
