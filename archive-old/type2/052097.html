Subject: [T2] 71 bus front seat covers?

I'm not doing anything near a restoration on these., I'm just looking for
slip on seat covers (no hog rings) that are durable, and fit good.  JC has
ones with basketweave listed for 58-77 beetle and superbeetle in stock
colors.
These would be perfect if they would fit my bus.  Bus depot has some too, in
tan grey and blue.  I have original low back bucket with square top, off
white.

     I really just want to find out what my options are, and if anyone has
any experiences or ideas to share.   I don't really want to spend alot on
slip-ons, if 2 years from now I decide to do this right.  I'm not above
sheepskin, but won't put in those ones that look like cows either.

Thanks,
Don
