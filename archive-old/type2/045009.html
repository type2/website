&gt;At light throttle cruise you can run the full advance of 38 - 40 degrees

&gt;and you are in effect using only the mechanical portion of your
&gt;distributor which is engine speed dependent.

I want to add one thing to this, just to be clear.  With a dual vacuum distributor, the vacuum retard will have no effect at full throttle, and a varying effect at part throttle.  If you're measuring from a reference point of idle with the vacuum retard connected, at full throttle you will have *relative* advance supplied by both the mechanical and vacuum retard mechanisms (and maybe some vacuum advance - I'm going to test this today to remove all doubt - from my mind anyway).

&gt;To fine tune a mech / vac distrib for your specific engine requirements
&gt;and available fuel, you disconnect and plug the vac advance hose to the
&gt;dist. at the carb.  Load the bus up to near its max weight, find a long
&gt;steep hill and accelerate (uphill) in 3rd gear listening for ping.

Keep in mind that advancing your timing to the threshold of pinging won't necessarily give you the most power.  It may be that less advance will give you more power, and of course a greater &quot;cushion&quot; against pinging.  A chassis dyno is the ultimate tuning tool and it is not just for race cars.  I've had my bus strapped down twice now and I've found that I could retard the timing quite a bit with no loss of power.

&gt;calculated, you have no idea of what it is.Some of the factors effecting
&gt;spark advance are: engine load, engine speed, engine temperature,
&gt;cylinder bore diameter, compression ratio, volitility of the fuel,
&gt;air-fuel mixture, knock rating of fuel, and others which escape me at
&gt;the moment.

How about rod ratio/piston speed and combustion chamber shape?

&gt;By the way, I received a rebuilt GEX head from Rocky Mountain and upon
&gt;checking, found the combustion chamber volume to be off by 3 CC's in the
&gt;same head.  Took a lot of careful machining to match the chamber volume.
&gt;That is why I use new heads when available.  The extra material appeared
&gt;to be a result of the welding repairs to the spark plug and valve seat
&gt;areas.  Take a close look inside the ports of a rebuilt head and compare
&gt;to new.  You might be surprised.

I was suprised, the FIRST time.  Since then I've learned not to trust anyone that rebuilds VW heads, especially GEX.
