Subject: Valve and Rod job... I think.

Hi Everyone,

Last Thursday, when I was driving &quot;Bess the Bus&quot;, a sound from the engine 
came forth.  It sounded like all a boulder was rumbling in the 
engine.  Another way to describe it is, it sounded like a LOUD aluminum can 
be crushed in the engine.  I did not feel any loss of power and  at 
mid-range RPM's the noise went away.  I opened up the Muir book to 
investigate and it sounds like I am lucky I made it home.  I was only about 
8 miles from home when I heard the noise.  BTW, when I got home there was 
no black smoke or awful smell.

On page 237 of my edition of the Muir book it states that I have &quot;rod 
knock&quot;.  I called the Bus Boys today (BTW, I think they are very helpful, 
Bus Depot too, just my two cents) and the gentleman guessed that it might 
be a blown valve seat.  So I am in for my first engine pull I think.

My question is, does anyone have any suggestions on what to look for?
While the engine is out, does anyone have any recommendations on what 
should be replaced?

I purchased Bess in Sept and she came with a library of receipts.  Looking 
though them, Bess had new heads put in last year but the labor notes state 
this &quot;intake valves are sunken into the head, seats feel tight but appear 
to be moving in the head&quot;.  The $2900 repair bill states that the shop 
replaced the heads but not the valve assemblies.  Does that sound 
right?  Maybe this is the problem.

I have about $450 dollars to start fixing Bess and pull the engine.  Can 
anyone guess if that will be enough money?  I would hate to pull the engine 
and discover I am going to need more money then I have, I would rather 
leave her in the garage until I raise the funds.

Other notes that might help.
78 2.0 manual transmission
no smoke when the noise started, no apparent loss of power, but I drive it 
like a baby.
there was plenty of oil in it when I got home
no red/green or other lights went on when the noise started.
Bess made the noise all the way home unless I was at midrange RPM's

Thanks very much in advance,
Don Manzano
