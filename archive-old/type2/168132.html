Subject: 1971 Westy for sale (parts vehicle) Albany, NY

Now that's it's spring I'm putting my 71 Wsety back up for sale $300 takes 
it, whattya get..... Complete vehicle except for engine block, but have fly 
wheel and just about everything that else goes with it including German Heads in 
good shape! Child cot, all curtains, stool, all original camping interior etc. 
Front axle is in good shape, sliding door works but floor board is shot as 
usual places. Tranny is strong. You tow away. 
 
I'll give this sale two weeks and then I will be parting it out. But would 
much rather sell it whole. If you can weld it's salvageable but otherwise I say 
it makes a great parts vehicle. Pictures upon serious requests only.
 
Thanks, Andy 518-339-4454
