(If the clutch pedal feels the same as always and the clutch
doesn't disengage you've got a bad pilot bearing, which requires engine)
 
This is what its doing...
 
Ahhhh man!!!!

	&gt; Well I believe that my clutch as gone south.  I can't get into any gear.  Now I'm gonna have to get some one to fix her for me.
	&gt;
	&gt; What can I expect to pay to have some one fix my clutch?
	
	Don't be too quick to blame the clutch.  Has the clutch pedal &quot;feel&quot;
	suddenly changed?  If so, you have a bad clutch cable which isn't too bad
	to replace.  If the clutch pedal feels the same as always and the clutch
	doesn't disengage you've got a bad pilot bearing, which requires engine
	removal.
	
	Hope it's the first one!
