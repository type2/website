Subject: Re: [T2] Weird Engine Sound?

might be something wrong..
just last week i was thank goodness changeing the pushrod seals when i found my retainer wire for my pushrods broken inside...
i wouldnt of known unless i would have done so...
good thing...
i know now that i have to replace the push rods...
it eat through three of the four on that head....
thank goodness for leaking push rod seals for once...LOL...

&gt;I must say you are the coolest person on the list, it's awesome to hear your 
&gt;engine sounds.
&gt;
&gt;I'm not a guru but when's the last time you adjusted the valves, i wonder if 
&gt;it's a vavle ticking.
