Subject: 1600Dp muffler install on 65' bus?

Hi,

I am soon to embark on installing a new (stock) muffler on my 1600Dp bus
engine (for 65' westy) are there any tricks or thingsthat I should watch
out for? Or is the install pretty starightforward and self evident?

Also has anyone had any luck painting a muffler w/ grey paint that actually
stays on for any length of time. I suppose I good get the muffler powder
coated or something but that would cost more than a new muffler costs. Do
most people just give up and let the muffler rust?

m.
