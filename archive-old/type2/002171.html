Hey Fellow 4 bangers...
Just wanted to express my gratitude for all the accumulated
wisdom and experience i have gained from reading the list for only a week or
two.
I never knew email could be this fun.

I finally got a VW  oh yeah! Just bought a '69 T2 about two weeks ago.
Paid 1500 us,  got over 2000 in NOS parts!   I think thats a deal, huh?
Runs Soooo smooth!  Good even compression, starts on a dime!
No rust, only a couple tiny dings in the body, (paint is fair

interior fabric kinda ragged... but got all receipts and owners repair log
for last 21 years!!...I am SOOO exited!  Or should I say I'm Buggin' out?

Thanks fer the help dudes...
Muchas Gracias
Danka
Etc.
