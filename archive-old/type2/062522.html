Subject: starter interchangeability

I've got at '70 Westy which, as all good bus heads know, is supposed to take
a SR-15X starter--but I have sitting on my shelf a brand spanking new SR-17X
that was going to go into my (now totalled) Safari.  Will this interchange
without modifications to the transmission bell housing?  Can the tranny be
modified to accept it?  Would any of this be advisable?  It would be really
neat not to have to buy another starter, and continue to let this one gather
dust.  Whaduhyathink?
