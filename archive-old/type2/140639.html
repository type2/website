Subject: Re: [T2] Will these heater flaps (picture) fit my '77 T2?

From Andrew Stephens:

 The ad says they are for a bus, but then the seller says he can't remember.
 Do these look like the '72-'79 heater flaps?

Yes, they will fit your 77. They are 72-77 flapper valves.

78-79 do not have the mushroom exit point. 78-79 have a tube instead to exhaust the heat out the rear thru 
pipes. [and before you people with 78/79's jump up and say yours look like the ones pictured, they may because 
someone replaced them with earlier ones]
