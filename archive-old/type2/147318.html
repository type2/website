&gt;compartment that was bright enough where i didnt need
&gt;a flashlight has anyone done this before and if so i
&gt;would love some suggestions thanks to all and have a
&gt;great newyear

I have yet to actually do this but.... I know that later model GM trucks 
have a little pull out light that can be used and hangs from the hood. I 
think a pick-n-pull would have those for cheap. Worth a shot.
