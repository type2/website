Subject: oil temp sender

I have a new VDO oil temp sensor that I want to install in my 78 Westy. 
In the directions it says to drill a hole in the oil pan that is under the
screen.  Is this the right place? I thought I had seen one in the other 
pan below the dipstick. Can somebody who has installed this let me
know what you did.

Bill
