Subject: Re: Exhaust Questions

I sprung the 1 5/8&quot; system from Berg (including new heat exchangers) for
my 1900 and I'm glad I did. I'd recommend reading Berg's Exhaust Sense
article before making your mind up. I don't have any experience on this
engine with any other exhaust but I know when I put a less restrictive
Abarth exhaust on my Type 3 Ghia 1681 engine it seemed to give me more
giddyup and it runs cooler too.

&gt;
&gt; Since I have my engine out, I was thinkin now might be as good a time as any
to replace my holey (not holy) heat exchangers and exhaust setup. I have a
stock size aftermarket exhaust now. My questin to the list is, at what point
is it worth going to the larger size exhaust tubes. Right now I've got a 1776

Would going bigger be worth the dough, or is it just hype.
Thanks
