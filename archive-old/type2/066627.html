The stool should also have come strapped between the front seats
on all late deluxe Bus Westys, there will be strap down provisions
for it.  Unfortunately they get seperated from their buses and us
poor stooless must search vainly for them.

well, John, I'd disagree w/you there, I think that we need to remember that
there is a difference between a jump seat, which straps onto the sink cabinet
and out of the way, and the little flip top console/seat that you are talking
about.  The flip top stool does sit between the front seats, but it is not
the jump seat.  The jump seat is something entirely different.

thanks...
