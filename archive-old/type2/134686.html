Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Alternator Questions

&gt;&gt;I have also wondered why the alternator wire goes to the starter rather
&gt;&gt;than the battery. The theory I have is that because the engine moves
&gt;&gt;relative to the battery any wires that go between them will flex. This is
&gt;&gt;more of a problem for thicker wires as they are less flexible. The VW
&gt;&gt;engineers had no choice with locating the battery to starter wire, but 
&gt;&gt;they
&gt;&gt;did with the alternator wire - hence it goes to the starter, not the 
&gt;&gt;battery.


I wonder if it is a serviceability issue. When you look at that circuit you 
have some 5 plus wires on the 12 V + side of the battery. These could 
junction any place before a load and still function the same. The starter is 
simply a secure, out of the way place to have them all meet. That seems 
better than having to remove them all from the battery every time it is 
serviced.

2 cents and bucket of chicken, anyone want to build a car?
