Subject: 76 FI Auto bus, stalling in neutral

Hi Volks,

A local bus pilot without internet access was asking me why his bus 
would be stalling in neutral. It runs fine sitting still when hot or 
cold, but in stop and go traffic it will stall.

Suggestions are welcome.... I don't know the auto tranny too well.


Happy trails,
