Don't you just love it when you spend thousands of dollars on rebuilding
everything except the kitchen sink and then find out that the original
problem was a leaking hose?

One item worth a regular check is the vacuum hose to the brake servo
unit (knowing smiles from many I'm sure). The way mine was set up, just
after it passes from the engine bay through the tin, it went right over
the top of the valve flap part of the heater pipe coming from the heat
exchanger.  This meant it stewed in the heat off that and eventually
perished the rubber.  I have since had the takeoff pipe re-brazed at a
different angle so it steers clear of this area.

I returned from a year travelling around Australia to find the bus I'd
lent had been unused for ages and when I started it, seemed to run on
anly three cylinders.  I had given myself no time to fuss with it &amp; so
drove it ~900km to get home.  Checked it out and No 3 exhaust valve was
pulling through the head.  I thought that was the problem &amp; fitted
exchange heads.  Nope still ran poorly.  Got dizzy reconditioned. Nope.
&quot;Carbies!&quot; I thought. Blow it! I'll get the whole thing done - recon
motor &amp; carbs.  Drove it 410 km to Perth farting and backfiring all the
way for the job.

When I picked it up, they said something about having some trouble
getting ti to run properly and after much head scratching, found a leak
in the vacuum line to the booster, replaced it and voila! Fixed. 1500km
later and I'm playing with the tuning after other problems, finally get
it right and then it starts barking like a dog at me again out of the
blue.  Before I can sort that out the needle &amp; seats leaked (AGAIN) so I
sent the carbs back to be checked.  When they got back it still idled
roughly and backfired at idle &amp; under deceleration but seemed to go
reasonably under load (when there is not a strong vacuum - duh) so I'm
thinking carbs and idle circuit and initial idle cutoff solenoids.
Eventually cracked it when, in desperation I pinched the rubber elbow
piece that comes off the intake manifold of the left carb and suddenly
it ran ok. Stuck the old head under the beast and sure enough - a
hissing/sucking sound. Couldn't hear it from the engine bay.  The pipe
the helpful volks had fixed it with was thin and cheap and lasted only
1500km.  I had done 40,000km on the other from when I bought the bus.

It's a wierd feeling when it all suddenly becomes clear that this was
the problem all along when I first picked the bus up after our trip and
the knackered heads were probably caused by no 3 overheating on a lean
mix from the leak with me driving all over the country in it.

Learn from me. Check that section of hose to see if its vulnerable to
heat deterioration and fix it before it gives you trouble.
