Subject: 1974 VW Bus

Hello all,

I am pretty new to this list. I bought a 1974 VW Bus a couple of weeks ago. It
has been sitting for about three years in my neighbors back yard. I know it
needs some engine work, however, it was overhauled about 4,000 miles ago. Any
ideas on what I should do to it first? For instance, should the fuel lines be
replaced because it has been sitting?

I enjoy this list, lots of good info.

Thanks,

Phil Johnson
