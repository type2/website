&gt;Hmmm -- how do you remove them? I was looking at them last 
&gt;night, looks like you have to take the frame apart to get them out. 

You push the screen up and that should give the bottom edge of the screen
frame just enough clearance to come over the lower lip of the window frame.
The hardest part is clearing the window knob, but it should have enough of a
gap between it and the window frame to lower the screen towards the bottom.


This is definitely one of those things that's easier to show than to
describe...

Give it a try and you should see how it works.
