 I've read Tom Wilson's book but I didn't remember anything 
about decreasing compression ratio.  
 Marcus:
I've done several of these 1.7, 1.8 and 2 liter engines in bays and
Vanagons and have some opinions.
The stock 1.8 engine is really pretty sweet with the bay window,
especially with the stock transmission ratios. The longer stroke will
move your power band down a few hundred rpm's, but will NOT make the
vehicle run faster or give you any more power.
Unless you are changing final drive ratios, I would not recommend you
change the stroke.
As far as compression ratios, I'm not sure about the 1.8, it's pretty
high, I think around 7.8 to 8.0 to 1, as high as ever came in a type 2.
2.0 liter engines came in 3 ratios: 7.3, 7.6(?) and 8.0, with the second
being used only in 912E's and 914's and the latter in European 914's.
I used a used set of 914 p&amp;c's in my 80 Vanagon rebuild some years back.
It went about 20k miles before breaking a piston due to my incredibly
stupid move of cranking on a fistful more lead one cold windy night!
If the muffler had not been bad I coulda probably heard my mistake
before it was too late!
I just recently rebuilt this engine and will give a more complete report
to the list soon, but the main point here is that 2 pistons are still
okay and will join swap meet replacements in a new motor.
I believe these would have lasted quite well but for this mistake.
My method of driving while in a low powered vehicle is to use the
recommendations of the owners' manual which says (and I quote):
maximum AND cruising speed - (68 mph from the 1971 book, don't see a
1980 book here in the office right now)
I observed similar practices with the 1980 Vanagon.
I must add, however ALL these miles were in Iowa, and even though it
seems hot in the summer, it's still probably 15 degrees cooler on
average here than where David Schwarze  drives (Texas, with his a/c on
too!)
I do not think any stock compression ratio (VW, not Porsche) needs to be
lowered any further, unless you are traveling south of the border.
Compression ratio can be lowered by installing thin metal gaskets under
the base of the cylinders. I do this regularly on the rebuild of 356 and
912 engines, but one must bear in mind that these engines came stock
with 9.3 to 1 compression ratios (on the 912's and 356 sc's and super
90's) and they REALLY NEED 1960's premium fuel!
The good news is that you always learn more from your mistakes than your
successes! (See above.)
