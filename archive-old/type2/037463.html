First and foremost, follow the advice on the Type2_dot_com page : change the
fuel lines.  Before you even turn over the engine again, do this.  Too many
stories of burned-out hulks.

Good luck, and enjoy your new beast!

Hello:

I have recently purchased a 1972 VW camper that had been sitting garaged for
the past 12 years.  It was running &quot;good&quot; when it was put into the garage.
It was a garage with a gravel floor however.  The body needs sanding and a
new paint job, the engine is clean.  And after replacing a few parts I got
it running again.
