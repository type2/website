Hello all, 

The question was &quot;without modifications&quot;.  To me
that means that it is completely identical -  you take 
one out and you put the other in.  So far folks have 
said, 'no problem- slipped right in' or ' I had to shorten 
the shift linkage' or ' had problems with the nosecone 
mount variations'  (paraphrasing here).  Now, if I had 
said that there were no modifications and to go ahead, 
what would I then tell the Reeds when they emailed 
to say that the nosecone mounts didn't match or they 
had to shorten the shift linkage??  Wouldn't that be a
modification??  The way I see 'no' modifications is just 
that- 'no' modifications 'no' matter how small.    

All 002 and aircooled 091 internals and cases are 
interchangeable.  They will all fit each other and work 
but just because they do does not mean that there 
are no modifications.  You have modified it because 
you changed it from the orginal way it was delivered 
from the factory - even if you used VW parts.

Just my view on it.
