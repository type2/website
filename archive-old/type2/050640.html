Subject: [T2] Fule pump pressure.

I am running a single Solex on my 74 Westy. It has an electric fuel pump,
rated at 3.5 to 5 psi.  My bus runs very rich and gets poor mileage.  I
assume putting a regulator in line to reduce the pressure would help.
Where can I find one, and is there anything in particular to look for? 
Is this a FLAPS item?

Also, does anyone have any of the parts left over from the original dual
Solex set-up? I have found a set of carbs and linkage, but wiull need
everything else to convert back to duals.

Thanks,
