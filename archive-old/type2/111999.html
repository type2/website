Subject: Re: [T2] Disk Brakes Woes, Please Help...

Sounds like a very small vacuum leak, block the
booster line at the booster and check the line for
holding vacuum, then check the booster for holding a
vacuum, this is to find out what area the leak is in,
vacuum line or booster. Let us know which area it is
in. I got a booster from H&amp;R also, and mine is working
fine. From your indications it might be the
booster,make sure it is not leaking at the master cyl
&quot;O&quot; ring, if the booster is bad, I'm sure H&amp;R will
make it good. Phil
