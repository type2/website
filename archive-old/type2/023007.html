I agree with Glen.  I once left my bus idling for a couple of hours (in the 
heat) and the oil pressure dropped even further.  Based on what my gauges 
tell me, I think the best is to hold the engine at fast idle, say 2000 rpm 
for a couple of minutes or until oil pressure and temperature become 
acceptable again.  Shutting it off when it's hot causes the CHT to spike.
