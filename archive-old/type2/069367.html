&gt;Yes, VWoA is lame but lets not compare VW's to the Saturn. Apples to

Has anynoe noticed how hard it is to catch the eye of a front engine Volks 
driver. All Aircooleds wave. Many other car brand names take at least a look.
But most front engine Volks avert their eyes like they are embarassed to 
be seen near one of those old noisy monstrosities, in case someone notices
it was made by the same company that made their car. I notice this especially
at stop lights. They sort of shrink down, hoping no one will make the
connection before the light changes. Of course this doesn't apply to teh old 
rusty front engines with a group of kids in it who invariably follow you 
hooting, and honking the horn asking if your van is for sale?
