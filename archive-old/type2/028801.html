&gt; The Danish company went out of business in 1999. I know that Alan
&gt; Schofield who runs Classic VW Resto in the UK bought Stuff from the
bankrupt Veng
&gt; company. So I guess that if you want the Danish bodywork the best place
&gt; for it is to ask Alan Schofield.


Schofield (and a few others, including us) indeed bought some of the
remaining Veng inventory when the company folded.  But Veng' s tooling was
sold to another Danish firm who is still producing the very same Veng Bus
metal. It is identical to the Veng except for color.  So while availability
of bus metal was tight during the transition, it is now in good supply
again, using the very same tooling that Veng used.

It is worth noting, though, that Veng did not make all of their own metal in
the first place.  I do not believe that the cargo floor sections were ever
Veng products, but instead were of South American manufacture, rebranded as
Veng.
