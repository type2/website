&gt; This thing has been all over the east coast a couple times now from
&gt; Carolinas to Key West to Canada to the Midwest and Back.

&gt; I suggest if anyone still cares about it that you box it up and ship it
&gt; out west to Ariz or Cali. Unless we are lucky enought to get one of the
&gt; oft-long distance guys from NEATO to take it out there.

Only problem is, it's supposed to travel only by bus!
