Pro triple-square: If I recall correctly, a set of triple-square bolts 
came with my boot kit(s). (Can't believe that was seven years ago.) I 
like to keep it that way because it's a standard (and I like standards; 
very German) not because it's original.

Anti triple-square: You're right, Greg. Triple-squares are not 
Murphy-proof.

What we need is for Richard Atwell to make allens the standard by 
saying something about this on his site. Then allen-head bolts will be 
&quot;according to Atwell&quot; and everyone will know which wrench to take under 
the bus with them.
