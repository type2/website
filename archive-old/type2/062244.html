Easy to do with the engine in place.  Remove the lower tin.  The 
tappets are at the same angle as the push rod tubes and if the engine 
is level they won't fall out.  (When my engine was out, I tipped the
engine and indeed, they fell out)  I've done it with engine both in &amp; out.

&gt; Does anyone know whether it is advisable to do this with the engine installed?  How  
&gt; would you make sure, for instance, that the tappets don't fall out on the ground?  
&gt; Mine tended to slide out a bit on their own, though I had to pull them most of the 
&gt; way out with my fingers.  Smooth fit.
