Sorry for the last post,  I didn't intend to resend it,  ooops.


Hi all.

 A small comment FYI, I just wanted to say that here in venezuela these
water cooled busses are imported also from Mexico and are common seen as
pannel for cargo.  There were few buses sold.  The VW representative in
Vzla. cancelled the water cooled import last year  (it didn't turn out to
be very good) and again are importing the air cooled from Brazil.  The
Beetle (the traditional air cooled Type I ) is still being imported from
Mexico and will still be. This time as you probably know, it comes with
electronic injection and ignition and it sells very good.
