Subject: Bus keeps stalling and other stuff (long, but not boring)

Hi Everybody,  my 68 bus with a dp 1600,  009 Dizzy, and header, stalls
almost every time I take my foot off the gas.  I adjusted the idle to no
avail. It starts up fine, idles fine, and when I am on the gas it runs
good.  When I slow down it stalls and does not want to idle after
restarting it. It dosnt idle unless I push the gas and then it sputters
and spits.  I plan on changing the fuel filter but other than that I
don't know what to do.  

At night, when I park, the gas guage is in one spot and in the morning
when I start the Bus up the  gas level is noticibly lower.  Does the gas
evaporate?  I Don't have any leaks.

Does anybody know where I can get front  wide five disk brakes big and
strong enough for a bus?  I heard Neal makes them for the Thing, would
those work?

And now its story time,  The other day I pulled up on the right of a
School Bus full of elementary aged kids.  A few kids looked over and
smiled, waved, and gave peace signs.  After that all the kids in the bus
moved to the right side to check out my Bus. I'm still grinning from
that one, It made my day! 
  Thanks for Advance for your help
