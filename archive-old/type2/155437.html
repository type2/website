Subject: MY 78 Van has been stolen

Help!  My White 78 VW Westy was stolen last night from the  
underground parkade of the Holiday Inn Howe Street in Vancouver.  It  
has orange,green, yellow plaid seats and has a distinct West coast  
motif painted on the spare tire cover.  The license is BC 273 HAR.   
If anyone spots it, I would appreciate hearing from you.  Thanks  
Rhonda in Victoria, BC
