Clary, John (CLRY) sends:

&gt; On to the seat:  Mine is broken although the big knob does in fact move one
&gt; side of the seat back (the other side just floats loosely).  How do I remove
&gt; the seat to either fix or replace it.  Obviously it's not as easy as the
&gt; passenger seat.  Thanks,

It's almost easier. There is a lever under the front of the seat that lifts
up; this lets you adjust the position of the seat. Lift the lever up and
pull the seat forward until it comes off the rails.
