&gt;How about having a second compressor and motor mounted under the rear seat

&gt;$30), so mostly the installation would be the cost of the valves

I don't see why having a second compressor would be a good thing.  As you point out, the shortage of space in a bus is a good reason to use the compressor you already have.  As for servicing the belts, I don't think under the rear seat would be significantly easier than the engine compartment.


&gt;Of course if you are in a camp with 110, then why not just have an AC that
&gt;you mount out of the window like Stan at
&gt;http://williamwareagency_dot_com/forsale/stanvan/ac_unit.htm 

Again, why carry TWO compressors, TWO condensers, TWO evaporators, more fan motors, etc??  Plus, I don't like setup/teardown when camping.  I want to get to the campsite and start having fun, not spend hours setting up tents, awnings, stoves, A/C units, etc. and then have to do the reverse before I leave.  I've been camping for over 30 years now and I am finally starting to home in on what makes it an enjoyable experience and what makes it a PITA.  

I've done the window unit thing because it works and is easy, but it is far from an ideal solution.  An ideal solution does not have redundant parts.  Redundant parts cost money, take up space, decrease gas mileage and are another potential source of problems.  Another (less important) reason not to put a window unit in the front window is aesthetics - I'll leave it at that.  

I have a perfectly good A/C system in my bus already and there is no good reason why I can't also use it while parked.  Like many things in life, it is simply an engineering challenge.  It sure as heck isn't impossible.  :-)
