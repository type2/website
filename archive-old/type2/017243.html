Subject: Steering box and horn replacement.

To all;

Craig's explenation about fixing the horn is very good.    Now, I don't
whant to sound stupid but how _at_%&amp;*&amp;_at_  do I get the button off the
wheel.    I've been trying to get it off for several days and its been
impossible, in fact, I broke part of the wheel trying to force it out.

Thanks.
