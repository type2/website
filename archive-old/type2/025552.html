I got the bus started last week and then had a major oil leak. I determined
it was the oil cooler. I did not have time to pull the engine and trouble
shoot - too much work/work. So I brought it to a local mechanic. Turns out I
put washers on the case side of the studs for the oil cooler. Rookie mistake
I guess - other wise everything seems OK. Not bad for the first time on a
pancake ( I had a 71 that I rebuilt and pulled several times before). A
couple of questions. Were the timing is right, the vacuum diaphram of the
distributer pushes right against the cold start injector. Is this normal?
Second, when I was puting on my bumper, I noticed two important details the
shop missed. (1) the bolts that hold the rear engine carrier to the holders
bolted to the frame were *very* loose and (2) the foam seal that goes around
the engine between the tin and frame was very sloppy and not really put in
correctly.

Two questions would either of these problems undiagnosed caused me problems
e.g., too much pressure on the rear of the engine when the bolts vibrated
loose, or running too hot?  Should I talk to this shop owner. He is quick
(maybe too quick) fair price wise for parts and labor???
