&gt; &gt; i have read many mails lately about putting in aftermarket oil press.
&gt; &gt; senders, etc.  quite a few are recommending using teflon tape.  this is fine
&gt; &gt; but a word of caution.....BE CAREFUL.  the teflon tape will give a very
&gt; &gt; inaccurate torque feel and will cause you to overtighten and strip the
&gt; &gt; threads.  i recommend using some *pipe dope* all plumbers use it.  spread a
&gt; &gt; little bit on the threads and snug the npt fitting down normally.  this
&gt; &gt; reduces the risk of stripping and provides a bit of sealant.  to those who
&gt; &gt; are determined to use teflon, on a piece of npt that small do not over-wrap
&gt; &gt; the pipe.  one or one-half times around the threads is plenty.  fwiw...imho.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Am I missing something here?  The body of oil pressure senders need to be
&gt; grounded and tape and pipe dope will insulate the sender. The path to ground for
&gt; the senders is through the pipe threads.   Tape has to potential to insulate
&gt; more than dope as the dope wipes off.  Use tape and you run the risk of the
&gt; sender not working.

Scott:
It will cut through enough to conduct, trust me! Pipe threads are
tapered and one tightens them till there's an interference fit, i.e. the
inside part is stretching the outside part by several thousandths. The
pipe dope/thread simply ends up in the irregular voids. Take a joint
apart and you'll find the tape shredded!
