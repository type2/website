Subject: little elect' fuel pump

On my '72 (super stock - stick - PDSIT), I have not yet got the manual fuel 
pump to push out fuel.

I guess I need to install an electric fuel pump.

What kind of vehicle can I check out at the junk yard for a suitable 
electric fuel pump?? American cars are also fair game.

(I have a bad foot and I cannot travel the yards like I use to a few months 
back.  And until I get some response from the '72, I don't wish to spend 
another $30-$40 for a fuel pump.)

BTW, what does PDSIT stand for??
