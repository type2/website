I used tie wraps, couldn't get the darn metal clamp to work right:)

RAMBLE ON:
I also buffered a bit with a double layer of thick duct
tape.  This probably wasn't needed.  I was worried that after time the
plastic tie could cut into the boot.  But since I did not cinch the tie
tighter than the clamp, and the tie really isn't &quot;sharper&quot; than the metal
clamp, it was probably over kill.
RAMBLE OFF:

-&gt;Hi all,
-&gt;It seems from reading the archives that it's not neccesary to use
-&gt;clamps on the small end of cv boots. The boots I have came w/ steel
-&gt;clamps. Question is, should I use them?...should I toss them?...are tie
-&gt;wraps ok to use instead?
