Subject: Re: [T2] rear vent window info needed

I have seen this vent window leak on most of the buses I owned.

I have replaced the vent window with a solid donor glass on 3 of them now.
The passenger side solid window will fit right in and the seal for that
window will work too. Bus-boys_dot_com has them listed as 2 seperate seals, but
the same seal works on both sides.

The frame that holds the vent window just pulls out. You will probably have
some rust there so be prepared for it.

Throw that vent window out and install a 12v fan for your passengers!
