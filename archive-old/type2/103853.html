I converted mine too.  I used a Coleman kit that contained a hose with a fitting and valve on one end that screwed onto the top of the disposable bottles.  I cut the fitting off of the other end of the hose and used a barbed connector to join it to the line to my stove.  Works great except that it lacks a &quot;proper&quot; regulator and will blow the flame out in the stove if you open the valve too far.

&gt; As for capacity, well, no, the stock tank had more.
&gt;Problem was that finding a place to get it filled in the middle of nowhere
&gt;was a PITA. You can find the disposable cylinders in the middle of an active
&gt;war zone, and they are dirt cheap.

Agreed.  My stove lasts a really long time on a single disposable bottle.  No need for that huge tank if that's all you are running off of it.

&gt; I'm also one of those Baja Bus/Lets go
&gt;Mock the 4X4 types, and I had a problem with that stock tank hanging out
&gt;there in the open in front of god and everybody, just waiting for a rock.

Same here.  Plus, your bus will be lugging around 40 less pounds after you remove that big tank.  I could use that 40lbs for more batteries instead.
