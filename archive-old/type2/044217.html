Subject: [T2] It's Argon Time!

Today I decided to remove the plywood passenger-area floor from Edelstein,
my Riviera project. I'd looked and looked for some way to neatly remove the
whole panel by removing screws and lifting out the panel. Since that wasn't
feasible--I couldn't find the screws--I just took a crowbar to it.

The plywood panel was three-eighths of an inch thick, damp, rotten and
hiding lots of rusty spots and little holes (all of which are less than the
size of a dime) in the floor. I crawled under the Bus and didn't find any
extra rusted areas--I'm thinking that the damp, rotten plywood didn't help
matters any.

So now it's Argon Time! That magical time when you go through a whole tank
of shielding gas while MIG-welding the floor back into shape. Except for the
little holes the floor's good, so I'm going to buy a piece of nice steel,
use it to patch the little holes and the larger ones in the cab that I
already knew about, then strip the paint from both sides, POR-15 the metal
(silver on the bottom because I think a silver undercarriage would look good
and probably silver on the top so I don't have to buy two different colors
of POR-15), paint the inside floor white and install a new sheet of 3/4&quot; oak
plywood.
