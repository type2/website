Subject: help, bother with rego for a day?

i have just bought a bus an hour away from where i live it is unreg 
with no roadworthy certificate. Previous owner drive it to mechanic, 
which is close by. Needs it front disc brake pad replaced and horn 
repaired, hopefully it will pass the roadworthy test then. Should i 
bother getting the rego for one day or take a chance driving it home 
(take about 1 and a half)? Nearly $40 for one day rego.

Keeping in mind i have little experience driving buses. What do you 
think, i am inclined to stuff the rego but my boyfriends wants to 
play it safe. We are buying the bus together
