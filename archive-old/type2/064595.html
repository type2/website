&gt; &gt;   and last but not least:  a pair of those old-fashioned metal roller-skates,
&gt; &gt;    made, I think, by Winchester (but any would do) - the kind which fasten
&gt; &gt;     onto the outside of your shoes and are length- and width-adjustable
&gt; &gt;      with a metal key.  They have leather straps for the ankle.  They were
&gt; &gt;       very popular in the 60's.

Hey I think I have a pair of these.  I'll trade you for your 79 bug ;-)
