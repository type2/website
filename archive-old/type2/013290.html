&gt;Has anyone used a heat gun on plastic trim to straighten out wrinkles 
&gt;on a westfalia cabinet?
&gt;Does it work well?
&gt;Will it damage the cabinets?

Todd:

Be VERY, VERY careful.  Some heat guns put out a very concentrated beam of heat and can melt vinyl almost instantly.  I would recommend using steam to straighten wrinkles in car vinyl.  If you don't have access to a steam wand, try using a hand-held clothes steamer.  Some of these don't put out enough heat, so another alternative would be to use the steam blast button on a clothes iron.  However, if the iron touches the vinyl, it will melt and stick to the iron almost immediately.
