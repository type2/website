&gt; Close up all of the heater system - you are loosing cooling air to the
&gt; outside air. You can overheat your bus this way.
&gt; 
&gt; Also I would recommend that you ensure all of the cooling tin is on the
&gt; bottom of the engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Replace the engine to body seal and the engine lid seal.
&gt; 
&gt; That way you are not recirculating the heated air off of the bottom of your
&gt; exhaust or air that has already been used once to cool the engine (already
&gt; hot air).

Ok, www.bustedbus_dot_com has some great diagrams of the heating system, and I
see what I am missing. (Not a hole lot, but enough) and your right. I am
going to overheat unless I do something quick. I'm currently not driving it
while I go over the drivetrain with a fine tooth comb.  Also, the left
heater knob on the dash is &quot;stuck&quot; in the half-way position. So I have a lot
of tracing back to do, as well as getting her in ship shape for the summer
camping season.
