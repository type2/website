Subject: Shoulder to cry on - needed !! 

I may be selling my '72 Westy to another older gentleman.  But I do not feel 
that he is the right person for this '72 Westy.

He says he had a '73 and a '79 camper as a parent, and a '55 Beetle in his 
youth, but he doesn't seem top be able to pass the tests I have been giving 
him.

He does know Ed's VW restoration in Clinton MD, where he lives, but I don't 
know if he has a decent mechanic at home, or if he will be able to maintain 
the VW himself.

But the other 3 potential buyers are not expressing any sincere interest, 
and this gentleman called me a second time, after I ignored his phone call 
earlier.

If it was up to the wife, she would say, &quot;Sell the '72 to the first person 
with a fist full of cash...&quot;  And I would respond, &quot;Marry our daughter off 
to the first person who asks and has a steady job!!&quot;

I am afraid that I may have to sell it to this gentleman, and I will have 
regrets forever.

On the other hand, my '78 Westy daily driver is not going to be sold, but 
saw-all-ed into tiny pieces and carried off to the metal recycle bin at Ft 
Belvoir!!!


What questions should I ask this gentleman??  First, like,

    Describe the carbs on your '73' [he specifically asked if the '72 had 
dual carbs]

    Who did the work on your two buses? Change oil?? tune/time/dwell??

    Who's your banker!!??
