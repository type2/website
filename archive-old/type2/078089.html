Subject: Re: [T2] chrome tipped exhaust (help)

Chrome paint is just very bright silver paint - I don't think you'll ever 
make the mistake of thinking the paint is real paint. Might look good at 20 
feet but may also burn off with the heat of the engine.


&gt;So the question is this: what is the best way to fix this?  I was talking 
&gt;to one of my friends on icq and he mentioned that you can get a chrome 
&gt;spray paint.  But I want to seek the wisdom of everybody here before I try 
&gt;anything.


Is this a rust hole? A poor weld done by the factory? A manifold heater 
fitting?

&gt;Besides the crummy paint job there was a small hole (aprox 1/8&quot;) on the
&gt;manifold by the flange.  I got that welded up but I guess the moral of the 
&gt;story is &quot;if it ain't broke don't fix it&quot; and this is the last time I will 
&gt;ever buy anything empi.  Anyway if anybody has any great words of wisdom I 
&gt;would appreciate it.


In my experience, EMPI is just a name applied to alot of cheap stuff made 
in Taiwan - lots of shiny glitter and chrome, fancy catalog pics. No good 
fit, no good quality, no good function. Just average or below in every 
category. Maybe there is something I'd be satisfied with, probably not. At 
one time (way back in the 70's) I hear they had good stuff. I was still a 
young kid back then though.

You have to search to find the good stuff or make your own.


Ciao!
