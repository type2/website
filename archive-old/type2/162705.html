&gt; 73 westy has a bad wine when driving.

take out a glass and drink the wine, (red or white??)

&gt;   it sounds like it is coming from the tranny or more in the middle of
&gt; the bay area?
&gt;   i thought maybe it was low on trans oil so i checked and found it
&gt; should just be changed.
&gt;
&gt;   well changed that and it does shift better but the wine is still there....

did you also check the final drive (if automatic)

&gt;   when you press pedal and try to accelerate is when it is heard in the
&gt; floor area or back towards back...
&gt;
&gt;   it made me think it was the tranny though at first but now not sure so
&gt; thats why i am here a asking you all.
&gt;   its like turning wine or grind sort of sound.. this is really hard to
&gt; explain.

it does sound tranny or final drive noise.  does it sound different when
you turn a corner??

is it constant with engine speed or road speed, ?

does it change when you shift gears??

is it lounder or more pronunced when you accelerate or decelerate or
drift?

doees it change when you push the clutch in.. especially at speed

sorry more queestions than answers
