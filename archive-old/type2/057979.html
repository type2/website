Subject: Westfalia parts in Westfalia?

Hi all!

I'm doing a tour around Europe in a '78 2L fuel injection Westfalia that

I picked up over here. I'll be in western Germany soon and I was
wondering if anyone knew of any good places to pick up some Westfalia
parts so I can trick this baby out. In particular, I'm looking for:

- A fridge to replace my crappy &quot;coolbox&quot;.
- A sink+hob unit to replace my sink-only unit.
- A louvred or sliding side window.
- Some of those push-button door handles.
- Replacement canvas for the roof.

Since I'm &quot;returning to the source&quot;, I'm hoping that there's
something around. Also, if anyone knows of any &quot;must-see&quot; bus or
aircooled related shops or sites, please let me know. Thanks in advance.

Ciao!
