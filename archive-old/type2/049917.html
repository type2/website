Subject: [T2] roof vibrating

Merry Christmas list from the Cancer Man here in Oklahoma. Were still doing
fine, fighting this awful disease on a daily basis. But after reading this
list almost daily I realized I have a question to ask. This past summer
while driving my 74 Westy from Seattle to Oklahoma, when the winds would hit
it from just the right side the front part of my Fiberglass roof would start
howling vibrating the fiberglass until I would either slow down or the wind
would change direction. Now I did take it off this past spring, clean it all
out under there and put a new seal around it. Any ideas on how to stop this
deaffing vibration? I tried tightening the bolts in the front but am scared
to over tighten them. Any ideas will be considered this spring.......Cant
wait to go camping here in Oklahoma.
