Subject: Re: [T2] Add-on taillight assemblies?

Eric,

Remember though, how directional led's are.

You might consider checking the $20.00 assemply at your local flaps 
because when i took it apart to see how it was made, it is just one long 
thin printed circuit board....you could potentially cut it a couple of 
places and resolder wires between the parts and make in more &quot;accordian 
like&quot;...so that it would &quot;fold&quot; into a smaller space....

Just a thought..

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt;
&gt; If I could get a prefab mounting plate for the taillights, it would easily be
&gt; work $30 per taillight to me. I know the lights would be extra beyond that.
&gt; I'd end up spending about $75/taillight but the result would be fantastic
&gt; IMHO...
