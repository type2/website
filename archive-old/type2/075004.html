Subject: Re: [T2] swivel seat conversion kit

Hi Matty,

When I got the 79 transporter that became the basis for my 73/74/79
Westfakia it came with a two Vanagon seats and two swivel bases, but the 79
transporter did not have the base on the seat pedestal.

I found a donor Vanagon westy in the back of a local Garage, and although
the seat had been scavenged I was able to get the pedestal swivel section
for $10 and removed it with 10 minutes work with my trusty angle grinder. I
welded it into place during the westification process last winter and it
works well. Installing the swivel mount lifts the seat about an inch and a
half.

A swivel won't work in the driver's seat of a bay-window westy because of
the steering wheel and the bulkhead behind the driver, but for the passenger
seat of a late-bay (no bulkheads) it is very handy, and works well with my
modified 73 westy interior layout. My Westfakia has no sink/icebox unit and
a full width Z-Bed.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
