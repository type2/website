List:

There are plastic(PVC like) sheets of paneling
like you'd find covering a wall
in an industrial kitchen, available at the Home
Depot.  I just noticed them
last week and this idea of sealing the under
carriage is excellent.  This plastic
pannel would be an excellent substitute for metal
and costly sheets of aluminum.

How should this be done? I was thinking of doing
this to help protect the
undercarriage from rust/damage as on splitties.  I
was thinking of doing it with
aluminum so as no to add to much weight what do
you think? VW recommends attaching
armor with plastic screws ( see journey's under
difficult condition VAG manual) any
thoughts on this?

&gt; 10.  Enclose the under carriage with sheet metal
panels to reduce drag.

ps mike i dropped the money for you in the mail
this afternoon.
