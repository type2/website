Subject: Re: [T2] knuckle slammer shifter

10-4. that happened to me, made me crazy. feller on the list from your area
mentioned that a few weeks ago, and yep a spot weld would have saved that
cage from a fateful meltdown.

&gt;
&gt;More info on shift couplers. All currently available I've seen have the
&gt;frame clamped to the collar, but not being OEM steel can work loose just
&gt;too soon. NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Find a friendly local welder and spot weld the
&gt;frame and coupler at 2 opposite points. If your existing coupler is good
&gt;except for this loose joint, have it spot welded and drive on.
