Subject: new Westy project - day 2

I got the fuel rail and injectors and intake manifold all cleaned up and 
put back on.  The shift rod was cleaned, greased, and slid back into its 
hole.  I gave up on the POS repo shifter bushings and used good used 
ones that Chris had.  The damn new ones just wouldn't fit.  The engine 
and tranny are now in.  My arms are still sore from the top two tranny 
bolts.  What a PITA that was.  We towed the bus down from BustedBus to 
my place.  It's tucked away in the garage.  I hope to have it on the 
road in a few week.  Here's the list of todo's.  I'm sure I'm forgetting 
something.

clean and grease CVs
replace CV boots
replace 4 soft brake lines
replace brake shoes and pads
bleed brakes
get 5 new tires
install supply and return fuel lines
change fuel filter
replace large fuel line from filter to pump
replace cap, rotor, plug wires, and check points gap, statically time
get battery
hook up wires to starter
install front seats
install poptop seal
install engine to tin foam seal
replace some vacuum lines
install steering box

It's been a fun couple of days.  I've learned a lot.  Still have a ways 
to go though.
