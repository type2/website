Subject: Re: westy poptop url?

Hola,

I just finished installing my new canvas last week (also on a '71) and maybe can help.  First off, the site is: 

www.poptops_dot_com

Good resource although pix are small.  

I initially was following his example but learned that I needed to modify his method a bit.

Although it is a good idea to tack the top section up first to check the measurement (you will do this many times so chill out and don't let it get the best of you!), I actually found it better to screw in the bottoms then tighten the top (as there will always be more room at the top to fold over.

Take your time with the bottom corners!!! I didn't have success cutting them as he suggested. Rather than a (VVVV) type cut I might suggest a Diagonal (/) as you might have quite a bit of material to work under the metal railing.  With the diagonal cut you can overlap without losing any material (either fabric or plastic beading).

I don't know where you bought your top so I don't know exactly what it looks like - but I got mine from plfvw (after a Loooooong time) and there are 3 mesh windows.  Just as someone else mentioned not too long ago, make sure the mesh goes out and the zippers go in.  I know it sounds dumb but when wrestling with the thing for a few hours;  wife nagging, baby needing attention, you just might overlook something as trivial. 

Also, watch your head if you do use a milk crate to prop up the top.  Those darn arms have a way of collapsing at the most inopportune time (I used plain old boards instead).

Whatever you do don't rush it.  Do it once and be happy with the outcome for a nice long time.

Good luck,

Eric
