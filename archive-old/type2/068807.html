Subject: '71 VW Bus FS, $300 in Virginia

I am selling a '71passenger Bus restoration project.  It needs everything
done (body, interior, motor, brakes)  The body is solid, with only surface
rust.  One rocker could be replaced and one spot in the floor.  (small)

I am asking $300.  Van is located in Richmond, VA.

Thanks,

Tim :)
