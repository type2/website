Subject: uneasy about brakes...

Volks,
My '68 stops fast and straight (especially for having
drums all around). And passed vehicle inspection two
weeks ago.

But the pedal seems to go way, way down-- to about
4-5&quot; of the floor--then stops rock hard. (BTW, The
brake idiot light on the dash isn't functional.)

The brake linings seem to be fat.

THis is my first vw bus in 30 years and I'm not sure
how the breaks are supposed to feel. 
Does this low-down brake pedal sound right?

Tnx in advance, 

=====
