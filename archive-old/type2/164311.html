Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Tell us about YOUR heat

&gt; Is your Mr. Buddy heater powered by the 1lb bottles or do you have it
tied in to the Westy propane tank?&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; I use the disposable tanks.

I picked up one of those adapters from Harbor Freight that allows you to
refill the disposable bottles.  Fill up a 20 lb. bottle at the propane
supplier and then refill the little 1 lb. bottles from that.

Not entirely safe for transport in some locals.  I believe that you can't
take a refilled disposable bottle through traffic tunnels here in the states
for instance.  But it works for me and saves me that $5.00 a bottle price at
the store.

And keeps me and mine warm.

- Mike
