Belly pans also covered the BA-6 gas heaters... if your talking about the
belly and not the pedal pans

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Can anyone tell if all the bay-windows came with belly pans

&gt;Are you meaning the front pedal pan?
&gt;Or the belly pans that are mounted to the frame under the middle of the
bus?
&gt;I have seen belly pans on early bay sunroof buses.
&gt;As far as I know and have seen, the pedal pan came on every bus.
