Subject: GPS Devices

GPS's work great in the Bus.  I use mine quite often with my other hobby of 
astronomy.  
I use them to plot observing locations for fair unique events.  I often find 
myself in the middle of corn fields with telescope and video equipment.
 
They do display mph, but be advised it may not be as accurate as your 
speedometer.  GPS's work by taking the average of distance travelled per time, the 
accurarcy of the your current speed is proportional to the the number of 
satellites it is receiving at any given time. This accuracy can vary greatly in a 
matter of seconds to minutes.
