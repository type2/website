&gt; I wonder whether it wouldn't be just as cheap to buy

my

Well, it depends.  To do it properly is a hassle, as you really need
to clean up the joint squeaky clean before you take it off.  If you
don't, you will contaminate the innerds with dirt.  If someone else
has removed the transmission, then the contamination has probably been
done for you.

If contaminated, getting the boot off the axle for cleaning will be a
problem.  Old boots, while flexible enough to work, might be too stiff
to remove without cracking.  Crack one and you'll be back to square one.

If you manage to make the transplant, you still have unknown CVs that
might cause problems.

Somehow, the prospect of laying on the oily dirt under a junkyard bus
cleaning and removing the axle doesn't really appeal to me either!

I prefer to use new boots.  My Rockfords are still looking new at 1.5
years in service.  See http://www.rockfordcv_dot_com

PS:  An interesting bus logo can be found at:

It looks almost like my bus, except mine is a slightly darker green.
No VWs actually mentioned in the article, though.
