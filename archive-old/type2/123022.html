Subject: RE: [T2] Adjusting flaps/thermostat when in a warm climate?

Having not even seen a picture of said thermostat my best guess would be
corrosion would be the cause of a VW thermostat failing shut.

.

BTW I just got a p-mail from ONE person who has indeed held a &quot;failed
closed&quot; thermostat in their hot little hands...  But ONE out of millions
served does nothing to convince me that the system has no merit.  Having
said that, I would like to submit to the party in question (Tom?  I hate
to drag you in to this...) - was that thermostat EVER submitted to the
manufacturer for some sort of evaluation?  I'd love to see the
explanation for the failure mode.  Seriously!
