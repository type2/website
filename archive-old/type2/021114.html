I used a wire wheel to clean up the rims,, then primered them with a yellow zinc
chromate primer,from a rattle can, then painted them some color of white
automotive spray paint,, 
mine are about 10 years old, 100kmiles, second set of tires,, with the balancing
weights on the back of the rim,, and still look great!,,, 
I made sure to scrape offf the paint on the surface area that contacts the brake
drum,,, when the paint on that area gets hot, it melts,burns off,, and the wheel
nuts get looooose,, and the wheel can fall off

&gt; &gt; time it is going to be too expensive.  so, i was wondering if any
&gt; &gt; of you out there have painted your rims yourself.  please report on the
&gt; &gt; materials you used as well as long term results. i really dont want the
&gt; &gt; paint to start chipping/flaking 6 months down the road.
