Subject: Re: [VB] Friday musings, Buses &amp; Harleys

&gt; Then last night a buddy came over to the house to show me his &quot;new&quot;
&gt;Harley soft tail. It was loud, way too expensive, and he says that you
&gt;really have to baby them and give them a lot of maitenance attention. So I
&gt;asked him why not spend HALF the money, get a honda or kawasaki bike in
&gt;better shape that requires less maintenance and runs quieter.

Actually, you should have replaced those brands w/ Ural or BMW!!  Not only
rugged and dependable, but aircooled German (ok, the Ural is Rooskie, but
they took the BMW plant back home w/ em after WW2)!

As for the VW comparision, I have NEVER seen a VW that took so much
piddling around with just to get it going as I do the Harley boys. I think
Harley MAKES em a piece of crap just for 'the mystique.'  My roomie built a
BMW outta junk yard frame and used parts, drove it thru Mexico and back a
while ago. No problems. Can't beat that German engineering :)
