Subject: racing engine

&lt;snip&gt;
matty here. i am having a problem with my 76 westy. it
is grossly lacking in power. this thing is a dog, even
for a bus. the thing is when i shift gears i can hear
the engine race when i hit the throttle but i dont
notice the transfer in my speed. the engine races as i
hit the gas but the vehicle dsoent speed up much.
&lt;/snip&gt;

Adjust the clutch. If that doesnt work you need a new
one.. I would suspect.
