&gt; I remember reading somthing about being able to replace the type 4 engine
thermostat with an type 1thermostat. I read that you just had to unscrew
somthing on it and the type 4 cable would screw right in?

&gt;Has any one ever replaced their type 4 thermostat with a Type 1 thermostat?
&gt;David Kelly


David, it is easy.  The difference is that the type 4 has a male end onto
which the deep nut that holds the cable fits, while the type 1 has a female
end.  So you get a little bolt that fits into the type 1 female end, then
take the type 4 deep nut, thread the cable through it, and weld the open end
of the nut to the head of the bolt.  I gas welded mine, but mig or even arc
welding would have worked fine.  Works great!

Grant
