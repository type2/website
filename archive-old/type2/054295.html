Subject: big head problem...help

hey volks,
well i guess lizzy was tryin to tell me something this
morning.   nursed it home from work and was playin
around with it.   went back behind the bus and put my
hands over the exhaust and passenger side was pushing
out much less.   so i popped the valve cover and the
#1  rocker arm bolt towards the front of the engine
pulled itself out of the head!   now i have no idea
how this happened.   valves were just adjusted and i
when i put on the rocker arms they were NOT
overtightened.   this is a NEW AVP head w/ less than
5000 on it and i have a trip comin up in under two
weeks!   so can this be repaired/heli coiled or what. 
 or i am out an otherwise sweet head?   man this is a
bummer.   please let me know of any ideas.
thanks
shelby
