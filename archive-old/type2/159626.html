Subject: Re: [T2] What would you do?

&gt; By &quot;major cancer&quot; I take it to mean there are large holes, or perhaps 
&gt; nothing below the side lights.  I would not put much work into such a 
&gt; bus - there are plenty of rust-free busses available as donors if you 
&gt; are patient.  The best place to find these busses is... CRAIGSLIST. 
&gt; Look at Austin, San Antonio, D/FW and Houston.  Thesamba is also good. 
&gt; A quick search came up with these that are close to what you want:
&gt;
Large holes indeed.  There seem to be a lot more transporters than 
campers available.  I would really like to end up with a pop top 
camper.  Since my bus is an auto, I'm assuming that I'll want something 
that has a good body and good transmission (standard or automatic).  If 
I end up getting another bus with the standard then I'll just sell the 
auto transmission, keep the engine and anything else?  A big problem 
that I have is the amount of space available.  I could theoretically 
take over a large corner of the garage to store parts, but holding onto 
two buses for any extended period of time would be difficult to say the 
least.

I will def keep my eyes on craigslist, samba, and ebay.  those have been 
my main sources in the past.
&gt; If you are serious and willing to put in a significant amount of time 
&gt; and effort, you should be able to come out of it with a clean running 
&gt; bus, a boatload of spare parts and $1,000.
&gt;
&gt; -David

I like hearing that.
