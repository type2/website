Subject: Re: [T2] Color Wiring Diagrams [final word]

&gt; With everyone's feedback and some searching at the Library of Congress I summarized what I've learned about
the Bentley and the VW Repair Manual (yellow book):

 http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/RepairManuals.html

 The most interesting fact I discovered is that there are four editions of
the Bentley, not three and all of them have color wiring diagrams except for
the last edition which is currently sold by RB.

 The most valuable edition in my opinion is the 3rd because it contains color
wiring diagrams up to 1978.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Well...... not really the final word!

I have 2 68-79 Bentleys [V279]. Both are copyright 1979. One has color diagrams. Except the 79 diagram. It is
not but it is printed on the other side of the page of the color 77/78 diagram. Both are 3 page foldouts.
The other V279 is all non-color.
They both start the diagrams after page 41.
The one with color diagrams has them in the order of newest model 1st. 68 is last. And most are fold out 3 to
5 pages long. [3 are the max but 76 is 5, 2 on the left and 3 on the right]
The one with black and white diagrams has them in the order of oldest 1st, starting at 68. And they suck
because they are printed on separate pages. To follow a wire you need to flip the pages. 76 is really bad, 5
separate pages!

The only difference I see on the copyright page between them:
The non-color one has a large box that has a warning across the top:
CAUTION- Important Safety Notice
And then a lot of mumbo-jumbo.
All the ISBN numbers are the same except for the string of numbers printed below the Bentley stock number.
Color diagrams:
92 91 90 89 10 9 8 7 6 5
Black and white:
94 93 92 91 11 10 9 8 7 6
