Power is a function of how much fuel you burn. That's a function of how much
oxygen is on the air (in the engine). If you run much richer, you have a
greater chance of burning all the oxygen in the combustion chamber. However,
the more gas you dump in, the less air you can fit in there. Eventually,
running more fuel into the engine will decrease power since there is less
oxygen getting used.

Our sensors will come with VERY detailed instructions on how to use it, and
to get the best mileage, drivability, and performance out of your engine.

No rhinocerous soup instructions.
