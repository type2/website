Hiya All,

Bumper pans, that is!  
I just got the rear bumper off my 70 Bus.  Well, I got off what once was a 
rear bumper.  The PO had a rear ender and the bumper, pans, and brackets are 
in various stages of destruction and decay.
Looks like I'm gonna have to some replacing.  I know that bumpers for a 70 
are available if you search, but what about the bumper pans and the brackets? 
 Like the truth, are they out there?  Or should I try to make do with what 
I've got?  What does the list think?
One other quick one...............I'll be in the Bay Area this coming week.  
Any VW related events going on?

Thanks!

Mike
