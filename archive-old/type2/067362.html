something to think about:-

over the summer i went on holiday, left my 62 bug outside (in the rain) came
back a fortnight later to find- BIRD CRAP everywhere INSIDE the bug. but it
was still locked. Yes it has got rust, but not big holes anywhere. on
further investigation, the amount of bird crap suggests something very large.
or at least it must have been in there for a while. No dead bird and no
evidence to show where it had got in or out.

ps the reg of the bug is LVS 666    Spooky eh?!

anybody had anything simillar to this happening to them.
