Subject: Parting out a 71 Westy

	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

		Hey all,
		    I am going to be parting out my 71 Westy. I will be
saving the Trans and engine for another Bus/Bug and the interior Westy stuff
is spoken for, but the rest is up for grabs. The following is a small list
of things I have, let me know if you need anything not listed.
		2 Westy pop-tops from a 71 and 73 complete, canvas is OK on
one, bad on other.
		5 louvered side windows
		3 good doors.
	1 good windshield, minor chip
	full sets of glass from 2 Buses
 	2 complete Beams
 	Lots of wheels.
	1 good sliding door, some extra door parts.
	Rear hatch, engine door, and tail light housings, rear apron
	Rear bumper with heavy duty trailer hitch and reinforcement
bar(super duty)
	Misc. dash parts, electrical, some engine stuff, Air cleaner and
mount. 
	If you do not see it, just ask.
	 I will sell the complete Bus no interior/engine/trans if
interested. Pictures can be seen at my home page and at
http://wetwesties_dot_org &lt;http://wetwesties_dot_org&gt;  under the UnSuperBowl weekend
trip pictures. And again, all the SO-69 interior stuff has been spoken for.
