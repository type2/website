Subject: Re: [T2] trannys

Yeah, 228mm.  Now I remember.  It probably has the original '76 transmission.  I don't know.   I guess I'd like to have another one just like it to have ready to go when I need it.  They are getting hard to find at a decent price.  Thanks...KR

I assume you meant to say that you have the 228mm flywheel.

 &gt;What's the deal on 5-rib or 6-rib?

5 rib is an 002 tranny that came in 74-75 busses.  6-rib is an 091 
tranny that came in 76-79 busses.
