Subject: value of 70 Westy?

   Driving out in the county the other day I spotted a 70 Westy sitting 
in the weeds, looks totally rusted out. After gaining permission from 
the widow that owns it, I noticed that most of the rust is &quot;surface&quot; 
rust. Does this &quot;surface&quot; rust usually penetrate the body seams? 
Evidently, most of it began when it was parked. It needs all new rubber 
but the interior is pretty clean. The old man who owned it supposidly 
rebuilt the motor shortly before he passed away. I was just wondering 
what kind of offer I should make to her. I'm thinking no more than $300. 
Too bad I hadn't noticed it 5 years ago when it was first parked.

'71 Singlecab 
'76 Mango Westy 
 possibly '70 parts Westy

&quot;the bus came by, and I got on...thats when it all began...&quot;
