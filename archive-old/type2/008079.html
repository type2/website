&gt;    Yesterday we experienced the dreaded engine fire in our 71 westie. 
&gt;Fortunately, we live in a small town and the response from the fire
&gt;department was incredibly quick.  Amazingly, all that was really 
damaged was
&gt;the hoses, wiring harness, and assorted plastic/rubber parts.
&gt;    Granted, I was probably careless in inspecting the fuel lines, and
&gt;granted I was also unlucky- but beware it does happen- it can also 
happen to
&gt;you.
&gt;    I guarantee that when it goes back on the road that there will be
&gt;braided fuel line on it, particularily where the line passes through 
the
&gt;metal.  Please don't let this happen to you!  It is simple to prevent-I
&gt;didn't and I got bit (thankfully there were no injuries)
&gt;    One last item-anybody got an extra wiring harness they want to 
sell?
&gt;Paul

This is why the first thing I got for my Bus was a fire extinghuisher. 
Then I replaced all the fuel lines. $10 for the fuel lines and $10 for 
the fire extinghuisher, $20 total and will save my Bus from being 
destroyed. I think everyone should spend the $20 for the same thing, 
then we won't have to hear about burned busses anymore. Or at least the 
damage will be minimal because it was put out before consuming the bus. 
Just my $0.02
