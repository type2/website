&gt;    I'm just about ready to install my oil temp sender, the one that goes
&gt; into the sump plate. I was wondering what the best place is to get the wire
&gt; from down under into the bus interior ? Or how would you get the wire from
&gt; the sender unit to the gauge in the dashboard ?

have my wire wrapped around the rear mustache bar, to keep it up, and then
hooked to the wire harness all the way to the front.  have the guages
sitting on top the dash in a pod, with the wire comming through the dash
via one of the speaker grill holes right into the base of the pod.  can't
see the wire, it holds the pod on the dash, and no holes drilled in dash.
