I would also encourage people to look for the ole BA4 from the
411/412.  It is a 3500 kcal/hour (roughly 14000 BTU/hour) unit and
is much smaller and easier to install than a BA6.  However it is
designed for transverse mounting, but can be mounted longitudinally.
If you find one make sure you get the controls and the fuel pump
of course (and hope it works).  It too benefits from recirculating
like the factory BA6 installation and is generally a nice heater.
I bought one at a Bug-Out for like $100, and 2 out of junk T4's for
$50 total, but have only one good pump from the lot and only two of
the heater shells are actually useable.  I think the BA4 generates
plenty O heat but have not yet had the guts to fire up the BA6 in the
Vanagon yet to compare.

Course I bought a Propex as for use while camping seems hard to beat.

On another weird note, an '86 German manual I have shows the aux
gas heater with real neat, DIGITAL controls (just a timer I think
though, not a thermostat system), anybody ever see this system on
a van, seems cool they finally got a bit more up to date than that
big green TEMP knob.  Anyway Tom F. is getting the manual translated
so maybe we'll find out more.  It also shows the German 2 and 3 diff
lock Syncro systems should be interesting.
