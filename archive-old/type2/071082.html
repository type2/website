&lt;&lt; Preparing for the coming camping season (just got my new Komet (that would
 be a great name for a bus) side tent, thanks Steve) and I decided I would
 try to clean the fuzz or flocking (or whatever it is) that is on the inside
 of my poptop roof. I have a 78 non-VW (American Camper I think?) westy
 converted (via interior swap) to a deluxe westy and the inside poptop has
 yellow velveteen style fuzz on it that is somewhat discolored from mildew
 or something, grayish-black stains. I tried to clean it with a solution of
 bleach and water and discovered it's pretty easy to accidentally scrub off
 the fuzz.
 
 Has anyone found a good way to clean this without removing it, or removed
 it and replaced it with something else? I assume it's there to absorb
 condensation to a certain extent, so it doesn't drip on you.
 
 Thanks
 Jeff
 78 Camper

I just had a convertible shop put a new liner in over the old one, more 
insulation, it looks great and only $75
