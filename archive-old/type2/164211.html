Subject: RE: [T2] Rear License Plate Bracket

Eric,

Federal buses have holes narrow on the engine lid and required an adapter
since they were right off the euro market. The Cali models have wider spaced
holes that bolt up with a US spec plate and don't require an adapter. The
thinking was that the Cali buses would always be in the US, so a different
hole set was used that matched US standards. Also Cali models were only
delivered in Long Beach if my research is right. So in closing, you got a
Cali engine lid for your Federal bus. You will need two generic round
plastic plugs that expand when the screws go in from the front (your federal
used square plastic plugs). They are both readily available at many FLAPS.

This was something Chris and I noticed after parting a few dozen buses. You
can spot a Federal bus and a Cali bus by just looking for the rear plate
adapter.

I have seen about 4 totally unique adapters for Federal buses.

Hope this helps explain it.

Jon Stiles

The reason I ask is since I was hit in the engine lid is a parking lot, I
had to get a new lid.  My current engine lid has two holes near the center,
maybe 2 inches apart; the plate is attached with a bracket.

The replacement lid, from BustedBus, has holes far apart - license plate
size.

Eric asked:


Are there different rear license plate brackets for different years?

And Dan replied:
 
 i recall there being differences in california and non-california buses. 
 not sure about differences throughout the years though.

I do not find any VW part number for any license brake bracket. Even Bus
Depot does not show one for a bus.

I believe the dealer installed whatever they found as a 'local purchase'.
