Subject: Re: [T2] Help with mystery leak

From: &quot;Ted Kitch&quot; &lt;tedkitch_at_tedsgarage_dot_com&gt;
&gt; ... what the fluid is.  I'm in Bensalem, PA for the week so if someone
wouldn't mind giving me a hand that would be awesome.  I'm still learning
how to take care of my bus.

I've got the same leak, Ted, and my mech says it's probably the front engine
seal.  We're going to pull the engine in early September to deal with it.

If your's is like mine, it gets worse with driving and it appears that it
can affect the clutch, too.  (Splash, maybe?)

Whatcha doin' in Bensalem?  That's my ol' stompin' ground, just around the
corner from my folk's place. :O)
