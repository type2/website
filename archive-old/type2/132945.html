Subject: Can't start after carb rebuild...

Hello List,

I've run into a snafu. I can't start my bus

'74 Westy, 1800 engine (orig from 75 with FI) now dual weber 34mm ICTS.

A few months back I took my bus off the road to do some work on it and
paint it. My carbs (Weber ICTs) were leaking gas, so I decided to take
them out and rebuild them. I replaced all the usual stuff in them that
comes with a rebuild kit. I installed them about three weeks ago as per
the instructions. I let the idle screw touch the lever on each carb and
screwed it in 1.5 turns. I set the mixture screws 2 turns back from
seating. After cranking the bus for about 2 minutes it fired up very
roughly. It ran for about 20 seconds... and died. Cranked it again...
fired up for a few seconds, backfired then died. Cranked it again... it
ran for a few seonds and died. Couldn't get it to start again.

I thought about the situation for a week (usually work on the bus on the
weekends) and did the following:

removed gas from the tank (there was very little).

replaced the 7-10 PSI pump from my flaps with the lower (3PSI) Facet pump
from Bus Depot. I figured the 7-10 PSI was a bit much.

I also relocated the pump to the right side of the bus closer to the tank
which require some new fuel line plumming.


I installed a fuel filter in the engine compartment right before the metal
T fitting for the dual carbs. (there is also a fuel filter on the inlet of
the Facet pump)


I again checked the screw settings on the carbs and everything seems ok.


Yesterday I filled the tank with about 3 gallons of gas.... cranked it and
cranked it.... Nothing.



I can see the fuel filter in the compartment fill about a quarter of the
way full.... I can see gas movement inside but it never
seems to fill more than a quarter of the way up. Should it fill up more?
I can faintly smell gas coming out the tailpipe after cranking.
The coil is warm, so I'm assuming its getting spark.

I've played around with the mixture screws to no avail. moved them a half
a turn each way and it has no effect.


Can someone please point me in the right direction. Any suggestions are
greatly appreciated.


Thanks so much

Eddie Goodwin
74 Westy


P.s. I sprayed the final coat of surfacer on today... its gonna look
awsome when its done ;)
