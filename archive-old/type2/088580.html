Subject: Re: [T2] STOP ! ! (please)


&gt; Now, 167 ft /  23 ft/sec is just over 7 seconds.
&gt;
&gt; Just how loudly could I scream for 7 seconds of panic stop, all (hopefully)
&gt; four wheel pealing rubber, and the object of my attention drawing closer to
&gt; my front wheels with every second??

A locked up wheel will not stop a vehicle, i.e. four wheel pealing rubber. And
you have no steering control. That is the main reason for Anti-lock brakes. To
keep you from locking up the wheels and losing steering control. One of the
benefits was shorter stopping distances.
