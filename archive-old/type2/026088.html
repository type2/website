Subject: Re: [T2] Found a bus (Newbie again) is Dallas!  &amp; one more Q

Chris Cougill sends:

&gt; We went and had a look, and there were two buses: I wound up with a pretty
&gt; darned nice 71 bus with Westy interior (incl sink) but no pop-top for $600
&gt; cash (it even has a clean, open title).  It needs head work, as the timing
&gt; belt snapped on the highway, but the engine spins freely.  I'm checking on
&gt; rebuild options in Dallas this week.

Timing belt? TIMING BELT?

Chris, if this Bus has an aircooled Volkswagen engine, it has no timing
belt; the camshaft in the aircooled Volkswagen engine is gear-driven. Timing
belts are in overhead-cam engines, which an aircooled VW engine is not. It
probably does need head work if the guy says it does (just buy two new ones,
they're not very expensive) but the non-existent timing belt isn't why.

Also, I'd at least put a piece of plywood (not cardboard, that's too floppy)
over that hole where the battery went before I drove it a couple hours to
the base. Get someone with a pickup to follow you in case the engine goes
away during the trip.

Other than that, sounds like you got a good deal.
