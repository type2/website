So when they said, &quot;goodbye rusty cars&quot; they really meant it!

&gt;I grew up in a VW dealership during the 70s and 80s. 
&gt;I can remember Rusty Jones being sold to every
&gt;customer here in Northeastern Wisconsin.  It provided
&gt;a lot of revenue for my parents but I can also
&gt;remember the fall out when Rusty Jones went belly up
&gt;and the warranties associated with the rust proofing
&gt;were void. I can also recall rust proofing a few cars
&gt;myself and it being THE worst job in the shop, you
&gt;always got it on you and brill-o pads were the only
&gt;thing that worked at removing it. Incidentley, our
&gt;back lot was full of rusted parts cars where the old
&gt;rust proofing was the only thing holding a fender to
&gt;the car.

&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; You're right...there's lots of epoxy paints out
&gt;&gt; there
&gt;&gt; these days &amp; other products designed to replace the
&gt;&gt; detrimental stuff VW put on there when they made
&gt;&gt; them.
&gt;&gt; I wish you good luck with your task. &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Not to defend the factory; but I'm pretty sure
&gt;&gt; undercoating
&gt;&gt; was a dealer-installed revenue generator...Besides,
&gt;&gt; rust is
&gt;&gt; dealer-friendly, not owner-friendly...;-(
