&gt; Quoth Steve Dolan:

&gt;     Then all you'd need for insurance is another ground wire piggied from
&gt; the battery negative to the engine?

Yup, and I have seen this. It is not a bad test if you think this may be a
problem, but I prefer to do it as the factory did.  Extra wires make
pulling the engine more of a PITA than it usually is.  There is nothing
like discovering some extra PO-installed wire with the engine half way
down.

&gt; BTW, didn't the &quot;brain&quot; (MPC) have its own ground wire?

Yes it does, three of them as a matter of fact. but the &quot;feed&quot; for those
grounds are wires that connect to lugs the engine case under the intake
plenum. If the case is not grounded, the FI is not grounded.
