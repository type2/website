Point #2 (nothing in the Sermons on this, except that BH has long silky 
surfer hair???)  Some of us have such great looking heads, we don't need 
a lot of hair to hide them.  The only problem is when spending a day or 
two IN the motor compartment of the &quot;Magic&quot;bus, I come away looking like 
I stuck my head in mulcher.  Touques are time honoured headgear up here 
in the &quot;true north strong and semi-free&quot; but at summer temps. not 
comfortable.  Helmets are out, not enough room.  Who has solved this one?

my solution is keeping the engine compartment clean- there was some stuff on
this recently.   Makes life better if a routine tune up doesn't make you look
like you've been tarred.    And I wear a wooley cap. Yes it's warmer, but I
have long hair that likes to drag into slime.   It (the hat) likes to fall off
while I shimmy under the bus, and even with the car wash the hands do get
dirty, and I put my cap back on and stuff my hair under knowing that it's
slime time, but it does help.    

I used Simple Green as a degreaser, and let it soak in for a while.   In the
engine compartment, on the motor, in front of the fan housing, the insides of
the corners, the inside of the decklid, under the motor, around the valve
covers, the bottoms of the cylinders (this is important to clean - as a clean
motor runs cooler), by the oil pump.   Wait a while,a nd go down to a car wash
place that allows engine cleaning, if applicable in your area.

Fix your oil leaks, and the engine compartment will stay fairly clean.    If
you drive on dirt roads, dust and grit will get in there, and it's easy to
drip a but when adding oil, and sometimes things ooze, but do fix your oil
leaks.

Wearing a hat when it's hot is like wearing thick socks, steeltoed boots,
sturdy jeans, and a thick flannel work shirt buttoned up to the neck and
wrists and gloves and face and ear protective gear in 105 degree weather in
the full sun- why- because if you cut up buses you need it.   I didn't want
cuts and burns or things falling on sandalled feet and mashing my toes.   I
also frequently doused myself with a hose to keep from getting heatstroke.
But now I have some nice metal for my bus patching.
