No, Bosch coils are supposed to last more than 2 years. There are quite a few 
versions of the Bosch blue coil floating around, including fakes. Beware of 
the ones with the fully smooth top, as well as no permanent markings stating 
that they're Bosch. I just swapped my coil about 1 hour ago( it was a sad 
thing- it was my first coil from 1991, and has been on every vehicle I've 
driven ever since, over 500,000 mi) 'cuz the spark was getting weak(but still 
was running). The coil I installed is a German blue coil, which I borrowed 
from a friend and have to replace- I do not know where he got it, but they 
are still available. The lesser copies are known to last less than a year.
