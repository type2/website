&gt;Question #2 The plastic accordion adapters from the heater control box to
the
&gt;heater tubes should have a metal spacer and a felt type gasket.  Where can
I
&gt;get them or what can I use as a substitute for this gasket?


Oh my god, run for the hills, run for the hills, yeah the origional are
asbestos around a thin steel sleeve.  Get out the respirator, run for the
hills!!!

Once you get over that, the replacements of Vanagon era are either bright
orange or black silicone rubber, seal much better and are a whole bunch
easier to use.  Best place to get a few is off a junk vanagon though who
knows WCM or someone may have new, VW supplied new with the &quot;replacement&quot;
heat exchangers some of us lucked into.  If you do go hunting on vanagons
mind that the vanagon has 2 styles, one with a 30 degree or so bend cast
into the gasket to match the bent inlet into a vanagon accordion tube on one
side, you want all straight ones for the bus, other than that they are
compatible, the silicone will last forever it seems.
