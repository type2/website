Subject: Clutch frame mount pedal

On my 75 westy, I took the clutch mechanism out to check and lube.  I 
noticed the &quot;pin&quot; hole in the lever where the cable attaches was elongated. 
I have since taken it apart and have a new arm and locking pin, but after 
assembly, I am not sure if it only goes onto the &quot;shouldered&quot; pedal shaft 
one way.  Which is the right way for the lever to face in relation to the 
pedal arm, that enters the other side of the frame mount?  TIA
Sid
