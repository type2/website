Subject: Re: [T2] EveryBus shorter this year

&gt; The 5th annual EveryBus (www.everybus_dot_com) will be starting in just 
&gt; under one week. For those who do not know about EB it is one of the 
&gt; larger east coast bus camping events. Do a google search on everybus 
&gt; to find out about EBs of the past.

unfortunately this year everybus will be slightly shorter,  Don't forget
Daylight savings time starts at 2AM Sunday morning which instantly becomes
3AM, causing the great everybus to be one hour shorter than years past.

but I'm still coming
