Subject: Re: Driving in the wind

There are steering stabilizers like used on RVs that control sway from road
wind from passing big rigs but I  don't know if there is anything specific
to VW buses. Gusting wind is bad. Your bus is like a big balloon blowing in
the air.  Camping World is a huge national RV (KMart like) store and they do
phone catalogue sales. Their number is 1-800-626-5944 or
www_dot_campingworld_dot_com. See if they have a VW application for a steering
stabilizer and consider it.

&gt; Is there any way to make driving in the wind less terrifying?  We had
&gt; forty mile per hour winds here near Atlantic City the other night and I
&gt; thought my beloved bus and I were about to get blown off into the
&gt; ocean!  As for names, my kids call my bus the Beetle Bus, so that is its
&gt; name.  I truly love it, and as all my friends have said, it is very ME.
&gt; It is so great to have this list to help me with all my bus needs.  Beth
