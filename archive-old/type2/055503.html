Subject: 66 Bus at Auction

Hi all. The Barrett Jackson Auction, Reno Nevada, had a 66 Deluxe, non
sunroof  as far as I could tell, for sale. They said it had 460 original
miles and it sold for $20,000!!!! They didn't focus on it for very long,
but it sold quick!! Who's the lucky owner! This was on Speedvision this
weekend.
        Mike
