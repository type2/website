Subject: Re: 78... am I nuts or what?

&gt;I have a 78 westfalia waiting in the wings.  The current owner is willing
&gt;to part with it fo 400 to 500 dollars.  The interior is looking great...
&gt;the exterior is rusted to hell in some spots.  the engine runs the tranny
&gt;is missing gears 1 and two.  So  would I be crazy to buy this thing...
&gt;and is there a book that actually describes bus restoration for the
&gt;complete idiot &lt;me&gt;.  ie does it tell reader how to take off a side
&gt;panel!

Hello Barry,

It's great to see another Sudburian on the list. I was wondering who might
be the second person in Joel's stats from Sudbury.  And a name I recognize
to boot! (faithful CBC Sudbury listener).

This '78 sounds like it needs a lot of work. Are you equipped, prepared
(tools mentally, etc) to undertake what sounds like a big project?  If you
want give me a call and perhaps I can have a closer look for you.  I have
looked at a few of these beasts.

I'm in the book.

Regards,
