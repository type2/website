Subject: [T2] Belly pans?

Somebody recently mentioned to me that he was looking for a belly pan for 
his bus. I, too, looked for such a thing when I first got mine, but was told 
by several mechanics that no such thing existed. This gentleman I've been 
talking to said he'd hear that &quot;68-72's had
&gt;them, but it might have been the '60-70's.&quot; He also said he'd heard that 
&gt;those belly pans had problems rusting. Does anybody else have some input on 
&gt;this? I'd love to get something under there to protect the mechanics of the 
&gt;bus, even if it would rust away itself.
