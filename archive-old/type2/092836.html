&gt;Anyhow, amongst many other problems, her main one which caused me to pull 
&gt;her engine was the exhaust value seat on Cylinder 1 went bye-bye. SO, as I 
&gt;have slowly taken her apart I have found many things wrong... (Without 
&gt;going into unconnected lines, hoses, missing and wrong nuts/bolts...) 
&gt;First her pushrods were worn funny on the head side on where the tubes 
&gt;recess's down.  Puzzling....

That's common actually.  Lemme guess, about 1/2&quot; band worn all the way 
around the pushrod?  That happens when the retaining wire is not installed 
correctly and drags on the pushrods.

&gt;But you know, the retaining spring wire was broken in two I found AFTER I 
&gt;took the rockers off.

Bingo.

&gt;Next discovery, she isn't a 1700, but a 1800. Okay, Cool!

Lots of 1700's are rebuilt as 1800's because it is virtually a no-cost upgrade.

&gt;but now the funny stuff... they did put a 1800 head (p/n 022 101 371 H) on 
&gt;the 1 &amp; 2 side, but on the 3 &amp; 4 side, they put a 1700 head.. (p/n 021 101 
&gt;371 J)

Probably re-used the original 1700 head on the first rebuild and had to 
replace the other head for some reason and gave you an 1800 head.  Or it 
could have just been pieced together from spare parts.  Shame on them, the 
valve sizes are not the same!

&gt;Oil with les than 500 miles on it WA a real pretty iridescent 
&gt;sight!  pretty but brought tears to my eyes, that is for sure! No wonder 
&gt;the poor ol' gal had no power...

What did the bearings look like, or have you gotten that far yet?  Are the 
cylinder walls worn?
