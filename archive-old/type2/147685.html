Hi Ray,
The valves in the mech fuel pump may or may not shut off the fuel flow to  
the carb when the fuel tank in the 1956-1971 bus is more than halfway  full.  
The real shut off valve for the fuel is in the carb.  From what  you describe it 
sounds like your carb float is too heavy.  We had the same  problem and 
changing the float finally fixed it.
  As for using an electric fuel pump, we advise against it unless you  are 
using a lot bigger engine than a 1776 and/or way higher than stock RPMs  like 
for drag racing.  If the gas line between the fuel pump and carb  somehow fails, 
the fuel pump will not just stop, with the engine when it runs  out of fuel.  
Making for a beautiful gasoline fountain that just keeps  on pumping.  That 
only shuts off when you think to shut off the  ignition switch.  Plus you have 
to run a fuel pressure regulator with an  electric fuel pump to keep the 
pressure below the factory limit.
