&gt; This will wound like a silly question to most of you, but what is EGR?
&gt; Is it to do with US smog control or something?

Exhaust Gas Recirculation is a system that, well, recirculates exhaust gas
back to the intake.  The idea is to lower combustion temperatures by
introducing inert gas to the intake.  Lower combustion temperatures result
in fewer oxides of nitrogen (NOx) being produced.
 
&gt; I noticed my bay (recent import form Cal.) came with a strange air(?) box,
&gt; fitted into the engine bay, (above the battery), that had a feed from the
&gt; fan housing and an outlet.

that is your charcoal canister.  It collects fuel vapor from the tank and
sends it to the air cleaner when the engine is running.

&gt; There's also some form of large blower under the front belly pan.
&gt; Is this anything specific to US vehicles?

Sounds like an aftermarket heater booster to me.
