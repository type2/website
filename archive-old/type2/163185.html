Subject: 1978 Bus For Sale in Eastern Massachusetts

  1978 Bus Type 11   2000 cc fuel injection

 Brown lower  and Beige on top..white bumpers.

  88,000 miles

  Engine Strong   Exhuast is intact and heat works.

Good tires

Paint looks fair but body has almost no rust.
Some rust under windshield is fixable.
Undercarriage is rust free...no rot.

All doors including sliding door close with a &quot;click&quot;
Original rubber mats
No rips or tears in seats.  Center seat included

This was on the road until about 2 years ago when I got a new water pumper.
Should pass inspection.

This is a good solid bus that needs cosmetic work--mostly a paint job.

 $2000 drives it away.  And I  will happily consider any reasonable offers.
