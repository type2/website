Subject: check your breather lines

During a weekend campout a friend on mine had some gas pour out of the fuel breather lines into the engine bay. I colored one of the bugbits diagrams to show the hose I'm talking about (the one in red):

This hose is not obvious at replacement time unless you've looked carefully at the diagram because it is tucked up behind the spare tire well in the engine bay out of view. The hose is usually in pretty bad shape because it gets rained on and mine was responsible for some lingering fuel odors I had a few months back.

I would inspect it especially if you never thought about it.
