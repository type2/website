Subject: Re: Engine Paint

Well, I looked around the Library and the write-up on the various colors is
not there. It must have been one of those slow days at work, where I found
myself &quot;browsing without a cause&quot;, and bumped into it.

Strangely enough, Mick (remember him? the original questioneer?) has become
silent, apparently bored of the paint topic already.

&gt; It would be better to make the test as simple as you can.
&gt; What I would do is to use a few soda cans.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; if radiation accounts for 10%, then it becomes significant.

I have just ONE little question though: How do you then attach the soda can
to the engine?
