&gt; I have a vacuum distributor that I have been unable to find any references
for.  It has both Bosch and VW numbers stamped on it:
&gt;
&gt; Bosch: 0 231 163 011
&gt; VW: 022 905 205 H
&gt;
&gt; The closest match I could come up with was for either type 3's or
automatic buses, but the numbers are not exact matches.  Does anybody have
any idea what this might have originally come off of?  A possible clue is
that it came in a box of junk from someone who had a 411 (I'm beginning to
suspect it might be from that).

Correct guess!
It belongs to a 71/72 Type 4. 411 with auto trans, 1700.
