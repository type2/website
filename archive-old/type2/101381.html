&gt; &gt; I was wondering if anyone on the list had any expirience with the
&gt; &gt; rebuilt longblocks that bus depot sells.  i would assume that
&gt; &gt; they are of good quality, as everything from them has been, just
&gt; &gt; wanted to know if anyone had first hand knowledge.  thanks
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Our rebuilt engines are from AVP in Sacramanto.  You can find tons of
&gt; positive comments about AVP in the archives. Basically they are well known
&gt; on the list as one of the best rebuilders of Bus and Vanagon engines.
&gt;

I will second Ron's approval of AVP from my personal experience. Through a
twist of fantastical good fortune not usually seen in my life, when I bought
my 74 the PO included an AVP rebuilt long block. As my more usual luck would
have it I had to install it less than two weeks later. In 20 months and over
25,000 miles it has performed beautifully. I wouldn't hesitate to use an AVP
motor again.

Regards,
Dave
