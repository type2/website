Subject: Cleaning a 2L in a vanagon  

Hi Everyone,
The quest continues for a good running clean van and I figure the best place 
to start cleaning is the motor.  So my question is do I just wrap up the Alt, 
coil and ecu and get some engine degreaser and have at it with the hose?  At 
home so when it does not start I don't get stuck somewhere.  Will the water 
properly drain?  Is it easy to take the tin off the motor in the van to be 
able to really get in there?  I was thinking about some POR Marine clean 
anybody have any insight for me?
Thanks 
Kevin
