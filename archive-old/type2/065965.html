Subject: Paintjob Schlock, newbie tip &lt;f&gt;

Newbies take note:
In the original &quot;VanBondo&quot; cartoon that I drew for the NEATO OBR newsletter
#43, May/June1995, Rusty explains that only ten items are required for a
good paint job:
Latex interior house paint, a paint roller, a gallon of Bondo, a spatula and
a six pack (of cold beer).  To this day VanBondo sticks to his original opinion.
Besides, iffin you gets a nice paint job then you have to park away from the
shopping carts. The rough looking primered '57 single cab is routinely given
a wide berth by the nicest of cars! =)

Ellis adds:
Would I go through the hassle of RFH again? Bah hahahahahahahaha! (probs
not). Buy a bus that looks &quot;pretty good&quot; for what you can afford, make the
sucker mechanically dependable (harf-giggle) and drive the thing until you
can't get parts for it no more. Sell it at that point to someone over seas
(or me for my parts car) and then go get a beat to hell '65 chevy pick up
with a cheesy camper shell and get a life. I keep tellin ya! The point is to
have fun! =) 

Are we schizophrenic? Well, yes and no ;-)
