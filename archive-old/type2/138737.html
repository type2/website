Subject: Engine install update

I have maybe 90% of things assembled now. Everything went together pretty easy
after the stud episode, except the acordian heater tube on the drivers side.
Got it on the heat valve crooked and it did not want to come back off. A
little grumbling and it's on straight now. I am impressed with the rubber seal
in these heater tubes. They have little ribs inside that slide right on the
pipe but seal so tight once in place that you realy have to work to get them
off. If you ever come across a Vanagon in the salvage yards you should pull
them for your bus. I've seen in the archives that they (at least the seals)
fit on a bay window bus. Much better that those asbestos looking sleeves in my
75.

I would like to ask you all to wish me luck and good bus karma. I hope to
actualy get this 80 Vanagon back to life tomarrow.
