&gt;I like the idea of a switch to be able to boost yourself.  But you can do

&gt;run a different line of 4 or 5 gauge wire to a switch separate of
&gt;the relay.  Wouldn't take any extra time.

But where would you find a switch that could handle 300+ amps?
Much easier to use the high-power relay with large cables and a switch to 
toggle it manually.
