&gt;      2000lbs????  Even the non-westy weighs 3000 lb. dry. Westy's can
&gt;easily hit 5000-6000 when on a trip.

I'm thinking he meant 2000 lbs more.  BTW, I've put my bus on more than one
scale, and I defy anyone to load up a bus to 6,000 lbs in normal use.  Even
5,000 is a stretch.  Mine weighed 4100 fully loaded, with two people on
board plus fridge, batteries, propane tank, stove, dutch oven, tons of
tools, extra cylinder heads, and enough other crap to sustain those two
people for a month's journey.  And I thought *that* was heavy!  It was over
two tons, for pete's sake.  6,000 boggles the mind...  no offense to my
friend Mr. Seaver.  :)
