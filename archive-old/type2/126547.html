Subject: Re: [T2] Just put on a high quality Empi muffler (hahaha)

Hi Jason! How's Asheville? I spent a few years in High Point. Lived
through a few furniture markets. Heh.

I'm figuring that once this one rusts away, I should have my steering
and other issues taken care of. Then I can budget in a few hundred.
(Tax time maybe? Sole provider for a family of 4 should give a decent
tax return. heh)

Has anybody had an exhaust custom made? The pickings are pretty slim
out there as far as Type 4 choices. I've got a reasonably priced local
shop, and could take the flange patterns to him and have him do one.
It would still be a few hundred $$ though.

If I could find the pieces that bolt to the heads I'd have him make a
true header system. But he doesn't like mixing metals so they'd have
to be new out of a modern steel that he could identify. Otherwise
they'd keep breaking.
