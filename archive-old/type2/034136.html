when my 2L was rebuilt last year I unfortunately had to remove the engine
for something else about 3k afterwards, so took the time to check the head
bolt torque, it was way low, so followed the proper prochedure and
retorqued the heads to spec.

&gt; haven't seen anyone suggest torquing only the bottom bolts and I feel

certainly agree here

&gt; the torque on the lower bolts, but if they are loose, be prepared to
&gt; pull the engine and set things right on the top and bottom.

just my experience, but I have only ever had trouble with the upper head
bolts working loose, and that was very rare.  ;8*{  go figure
