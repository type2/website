&gt;Dave, can you give us more info on this product?  Manufacturer, 800# or e-mail
&gt;address, or something.  Us Listees down here below the Mason-Dixon Line do not
&gt;have access to this product via Lowe's &amp; Home Deopt.  I suspect that we would
&gt;have to go directly to a distributor and have a roll of it shipped to us.
&gt;That
&gt;is, unless someone up North would be willing to UPS a roll of it to
&gt;one/some of
&gt;us, but I asked about that before and got no response

I stopped by Lowes when I was in Columbus, Ohio last week.  I found this
stuff on the shelf.  It was US$60/roll.  I talked to the guy there and he
gave me the skinny:

OC (Owens Corning) WeatherLok
Item number 11615
$59.60
Any Lowes should be able to order it even if they don't stock it.
Was in stock at Lowes Hilliard #037.

The stuff is peel and stick, and somewhat flexible.  The non-sticking side
is impregnated with some kind of sand-like substance.  Probably great for
rooves, worthless for VW's BUT I still think this stuff will insulate well.
I plan on coating the floor with it, then one layer of 3/8&quot; carpet jute.
