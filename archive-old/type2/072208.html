Subject: voltage regulator check

volks, i am in the big stuck with my 68, and i am trying to at least
isolate a problem or two just to make some progress for the week. engine
and tranny were put in and the red generator light hasn't come on. the bulb
is good. the 61 wire is well-connected to the regulator. brushes are firm
to the commutator. battery is strong; adequate headlights/domelight. it did
crank this morning, but after a few tries, its not even clicking, i tried a
clip wire from hot post on the regulator to the coil, but no turn over, no
red idiot light. are there any other checks for the regulator before i
change it out?

the vehicle won't start. there is new gas in it, and i had to toke on it to
get fuel into the pump. however, gas isn't making it to the carb. and the
tranny is still stuck in some gear - not neutral, which makes hand-cranking
the engine difficult. so everytime i try to start it i have to use clutch.
wondering what is related, if whether it is the regulator, igition switch,
both, neither. - steve
