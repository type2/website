Subj:   RE: Formula V engines

This issue (&quot;Wouldn't a race engine be the greatest thing to have in a 
street-driven car?&quot;) was a recurring thread on the late, lamented, Porsche-
philes list.  The consensus of the expertsxxxxx respondents was that the
compromises that are brilliant in a race engine that will be torn down
every 20 engine hours are not so great for the street.  For example, magic
piston rings that seal perfectly but wear like wood; cam profiles that
make lots of power but chew up lifters; distributor advance that assumes
the engine will only be below 3500 rpm while fuel is being added.

I mostly assume that the factory and I have pretty congruent ideas about 
what's a good street engine.  It's a little less true for aircooled VWs
because you are considering the factory's good-but-20-year-old ideas, but
if I get to trade away 1/3 of the potential power for 3 times the potential
life, sign me up.
