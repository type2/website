Volks,

As Nikki wrote yesterday, we got her '69 functioning.  After a ride around
the block, we note the following:

The oil pump is leaking.  This is a 1600DP bug block with an adapter
plate.  I intend to give all the stud nuts another crank. Any objections?
I know I ought to pull the engine, pull the cover, and lap it, but I am
returning to DC tonight :-(

Engine will not idle. I am going to play with the idle adjust and mix
screws a bit, but I am basically an FI kinda guy.  This carb stuff is a
pure-D mystery to me :-)

Brakes pull to the right...  Wheels need pulling and brake system needs
inspection *badly*.  Of cours, it has 3 14&quot; and 1 15&quot; rim, so this may
also be the cause :-)  

In addition, the tires are worn to the point that wire mesh is showing on
some.

The &quot;win conditions&quot; on this bus, though, were to get it &quot;provably
functional&quot; (will move under its own power at least 5' forward and back)
so that the LA police would not tow it.  We have achieved that,
marginally.  Nikki still has a lot of work to do on it, but now she has
the luxury of not worrying about it being towed :-)

                           H Steven Dolan

Today's guru was yesterday's
&quot;Can I drive on two cylinders?&quot; poster.
