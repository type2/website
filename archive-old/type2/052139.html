Subject: [T2] Feedback

I have 4 or 5 p-mails this morning from my weekend bantering on the list
about VWoA and T-II's. I simply have no time to respond for several days.
Rest assured the feedback is appreciated and I will address them as time
allows later in the week. I will respond, but must wait till I have cleared
my prior commitments for the week.

Regards,
