Subject: 68 sundial for sale:$1450 in Mt

Runs great rebuilt 1600sp, new tires, brakes (all), batt, $1700 in
receipts minus my cost for vehicle. Still has sundial interior (water
tank-pump, ice box, bed, table, coat closet etc.), rough body, needs
front seat cover and crack in windshield.

This is my daily driver. I would love to paint and do minor work for a
great vehicle, but... I know your going to have me shot but I can't give
up my love for splitty's!

thanks,

tim
