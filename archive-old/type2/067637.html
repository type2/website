I think a lot has to do with how you treat you VW. If you respect it, it
will respect you back.. It only asks that you do the simplest of preventive
maintenance... like
Tune-ups (Minimum once a year.. include carb calibration)
Oil Changes
Check the valves (Once every couple oil changes for me)
LUBRICATION &lt;-Liberally lube her up every oil change... not just every
50,000 miles
Occasional Gas treatment (Cleans up all that winter crap).
Flush the engine once every 5 or 6 oil changes... to get the scum out.
Tire rotation (a must...!!! believe it or not)

Of course, the biggest thing to combat rust is to WASH it... It amazes me
how many bus owners let their beloved busses rot in filth... WHY? Rust is
the enemy.. A good wax and wash on a regular basis does a lot of good in
combatting it.

I wash my BUS, at least weekly even in winter.. (actually more so in winter
cause of all the salt, sand and slime)

Generally, if you maintain your vehicle.. eg. do all the preventive
maintenance stuff at the regular intervals... your bus shouldn't give you
much trouble.

BTW, If you find something awry... don't just leave it until the last
minute... it will only get worse... fix it ASAP.

I think busses still make good daily drivers.. as long as you take care of
it.. I don't think the jap scrap is really any more reliable or
dependable... It is amazing how many people will wash the JAP car...but
leave their bus to rot. Then they wonder why it rusts out.

Just a few pennies....

THE GOLDEN RULE:
&quot;Treat your VW as you want it to treat you!&quot;
