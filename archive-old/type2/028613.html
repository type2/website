&gt; Never, ever, take a car to AAMCO. AAMCO in Irving
&gt; Texas disassembled my transmission under the guise
&gt; of a FREE inspection. $550 later (in 1975) I had a
&gt; transmission again. I warn everyone not to go to
&gt; AAMCO. My experience is not unique. Other friends
&gt; have shared similar stories about AAMCO dishonesty.
&gt; The tranny was worn, and probably needed new fluid,
&gt; but it did not need a complete and very expensive
&gt; overhaul.


AAMCO charged my mother $2500 to rebuild the transmission in her '90
Honda Accord (in 1994). They kept the car for 3 months! When she got it
back, the tranny was worse that before. She brought it in again and they
kept it for a week and when she got it back, it seemed to work right, but
it always made funny sounds and didn't shift as quick as it should. Never
did go back, but when she tried to trade it in to the honda dealer 3
years later,  they told her the tranny was shot.

just a story :) it's friday after all
