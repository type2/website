Subject: Corvair engine in a bus.  How to change back?
Message-ID: &lt;0_dot_ca97a41a.255196cb_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Has anyone ever owned a bus that has been converted to corvair power or 
actually done a conversion?  I just bought a crew cab with a corvair engine 
and trans and what to change it  back.  The thing is I don't know what has 
been hacked up or not.  Can I change it back? Does anyone know what is 
involved?  It does look like a lot of work.
