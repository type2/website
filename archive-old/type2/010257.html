  The slider on my '72 basic bus does not &quot;pop&quot; open when I turn the =
  handle unless I give it a bit of assistance.  I just need to give a =
  gentle pull on the hinge/arm that is exposed on the exterior rear of the =
  door as I turn the handle and it pops right open.  So, what am I =
  missing?  Is there supposed to be a spring?  A roller worn out?  Replace =
  the entire mechanism?  I did notice where one of the catalogues I get is =
  showing a replacement roller for the mechanism, but don't want to get it =
  unless it will solve the problem.
 -----------

If spraying WD-40 on like holy water doesn't work, the hinge (the part
buried in the door frame) that swings out the arm (that connects to the
roller on the track in the body) may have lost its spring or be otherwise
broken.  When my door exhibited the same problem, I &quot;solved&quot; it by taking a
spare hand hold -the handle that bolts into the back of the passenger seat
frame- and attaching it to the outside of the sliding door towards the
rear.  That way, you could give the rear of the door an extra assist when
opening.  From the inside, you had to tell passengers to give the door a
little shoulder action to pop open the rear lock as well.  Just another one
of those crazy, nutty quirks.

I went years like this and then, due to some heavy washboard road action on
a desolate road in Baja, the hinge broke even further so that the arm hung
loosely in the hinge and some times popped out (a very bad thing).  Asked a
couple of question here in the NG and went to a junk yard and found a used
hinge assembly for three bucks.  Went home, extracted the old one in 5
minutes (if you don't mind bending a few things rather than taking the time
to remove everything as per VW specs), put the new one in in 7 minutes with
a helper holding the door up, and bingo: not only did it fix the broken arm
problem but I now have that wonderful pop of old.

I suggest a trip among the carcasses of your local wrecking yard...
