Subject: Re: [T2] Color Wiring Diagram for 71 Westy?

the Orange book that I have is listed as being for the 74-78 bus and it is
printed and listed only as Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft (VW inc) mine appears to be an original and the

So where did the color diagrams come from?

And Richard asked:
Is it a supplement to the green bentley or just covers the same information for those years?
 ------------------------------

I have the orange book, First Edition, published 6/76, that covers 74, 75, and 76 buses. It has colored wiring
diagrams in it.
It is not a Bentley supplement. It is the factory VW manual that Bentley copied. But Bentley left out some of
it!
