Subject: Royze carb kit

I called Royze this morning to sort out some problems with their SO-39K carb kit for PDSIT dual solex carbs.

- my first complaint was with their gasket material which isn't very fuel resistant. They told me they use 1/32&quot; MB565 fibre material made in the USA (I have no idea what that means). When I asked why it was grey instead of the usual tan color he said the tan material usually comes from Europe or South America. I couldn't pin him down wrt which one was better and he just stated they sells thousands of these kits without issue. He offered to send me two new gaskets which I accepted but I will probably be cutting my own gasket from better material. You can find this at Pep Boys or a carb distributor.

- I asked why the vacuum diagram for the choke was the wrong shape (too large). He said the demand for these parts is dwindling and the suppliers often move towards universal parts that &quot;fit&quot; several carbs. This wasn't a problematic fitment issue and I understand the reasoning behind it.

- I complained that the o-rings weren't the right size. Royze didn't have a comment but my guess would be they're not sourcing metric o-rings.

- My final comment was that a gasket was missing from the set. What I've labelled &quot;bottom&quot; in this photo...

...should come in a pair. Royze seemed unfazed by this. I wouldn't be surprised if they stop making these kits altogether.

CIP_dot_com sells kits from Tomspec Co. Has anyone tried it? It can't be any worse than the Royze kit...
