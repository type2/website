Subject: Cheap Westy pop top seal

In todays FWIW column.

Browsing through the McMaster Carr catalog, (hardware store for the
stars lucky enough to get a catalog) I noticed and purchased what turns
out to be EXACTLY what WCM and others sell as the major portion of the
replacement pop-top seal.  McMaster Carr sells it for $1.32/ft part
no 1120A23 bulb position A.  This is the EXACT I reiterate product
sold for the edges and luggage rack seal by WCM and the others.  This
price is considerably less than they charge but you would need something
for the &quot;wide&quot; seal between the pop-top and luggage rack.  However on
most vans it seems that part of the seal does not fail as water does
not sit in it and seep down to rust the clips, hence you could cut
there and replace the edge piece with this stuff and save at least $50.
I reiterate this is the EXACT same vinyl edged sponge rubber bulbed
aluminum clipped product.  I have ordered both they are identical except 
in price and must come from the same source.

They can be reached at (908)329-3200 you pay by credit card, and
mysteriously things they ship UPS ground always arrive next or second
day anyway.  Shipping is I believe factored into the price.
