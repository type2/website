Subject: HEADLIGHTS

New headlights, New relay, Two shops in town can not figure it out. Any 
suggestions on a good electrical VW shop in southern California? Low beams , yes.  
...High beams , No.
I don`t really want to play guess what part it is until I end up with an 
entire new system from    switch,  to , bulb.
