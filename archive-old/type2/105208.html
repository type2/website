Subject: Re:safe temp for 1600

I recently bought a 1600 from Bob Donalds of Boston Engine.  He
suggested using the dipstick sender that gets wired to the oil
pressure light. When the temperature reaches about 225F, your oil
light flickers. Hotter temperature turns the light on steady.  When
that happens it's time to cool the engine off, before you overheat it.
That's his opinion, but who am I to argue?
