&gt; I have a 1.8 ltr in my 74 that was built on a GE code case. Well, I have
&gt; never been happy with the dipstick. It's the type with a long handle above
&gt; the seal. During a recent juckyard trip I found a GE code engine and snagged
&gt; the dipstick. The handle on this one is several inches shorter but the
&gt; &quot;operating&quot; ends appear to be the same. Anyway, there are three marks on the
&gt; stick about 3/8&quot; apart. What do they mean? From the bottom up do they mean
&gt; LOW-FULL-OVERFULL, or LOWER-LOW-FULL, or what?

The stock dipstick from a GE, before I cut mine for the oil temp sender, was
this length with these markings:

I've only ever seen them with 2 lines marked on them.

&gt; I guess a related question is capacity. Does the GE code case hold more oil
&gt; thatn the AW code that was originally in there? The owner's manual says 3.7
&gt; US quarts which brings the level to the middle mark, but that's for the AW
&gt; case.

The GE engine is the same. From the 78 owners manual:
