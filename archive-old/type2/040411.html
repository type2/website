Subject: valve clatter?

Hi all,

Recently took the bus ('79 CA Westy) to a mechanic to have some work
done that I couldn't do myself (turned out to be something really dumb, I 
won't elaborate.)  Anyway, one thing he noticed: the valves
(or a valve) are clattering.  He suggested I do a little highway driving
to see if it clears up before proceeding.

This is something I would never have realized, since I've
only been servicing my own vehicle for a year (literally got the Westy
a year ago almost to the day.)  I took the bus out for a drive, but the
clatter still exists.  How should I proceed here?  The valves are supposed
to be self-adjusting, so I'm not sure what I _can_ do.

Any pointers?  Thanks!
