Subject: re: '81 Vanagon stumbling problem

In fact, that was my problem too.  I hadn't started the car since I
noticed the problem, so I had tested the sensor cold, but not hot.
Cold, it tested OK (within specs in manual) so I figured there was
probably nothing wrong there.

I removed the left intake manifold for other reasons, and while I
could get at the sensor, I discovered it was loose!  I guess it was
not getting a good ground after things warmed up, or was reading a
wildly wrong temp.

Anyway, tightened it up, now the problem has gone away!

Thanks for the input.  (One or two other listees also mentioned this
as a possibility.)
