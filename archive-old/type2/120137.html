&gt; 
&gt; it's usually not a electrical short that causes
&gt; problems like this.
&gt; Not to say it can't happen, but not usual. Do you
&gt; have a dwell meter?
&gt; if so set the dwell to 50 degrees then watch it. It
&gt; should remain
&gt; pretty solid. if it moves (especially when the
&gt; timing changes) it's
&gt; likely something w/ the points. This could be not
&gt; tight enough, worn
&gt; distributor or other things. 
&gt; 
&gt; are there some other reasons you question the
&gt; electrical system or is
&gt; the messed up timing the problem?


Hi Jason,

My distributor was rebuilt 3 years ago. Do they where
out that fast?  I was thinking it was a short because
it has been this sort of problem but different wire 3
times before (old wiring in on a retorfited 72 into a
76 FI).  I have had trouble with the points 'rattling
shut' but I thought it was the missfire. Each time I
regap the points and time the engine there is still a
missfire. I was figuring the torque cause by the miss
for is throughing the points and the timing off. 
Which is happening. Maybe I'm just thinking it's just
the same ol' shorted wire thing (which was fixed by a
pro mechanic).  I'll check for a short first since the
fissfire occurs still with perfectly gapped points and
timing. I DOOOOO have another strang thing going on
with my turn signals, brake lights and headlights:
when the headlights are on and I pull the key out of
the ignition the Bus still RUNS!!! One tail light is
on order to replace a bad one. But I wanted to trace
down at least this short, hoping it might have some
odd conection to the missfire. Who knows??
