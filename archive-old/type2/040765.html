Subject: RE: Stupid Me, dropped my spark plug

You're definately not the only one!  I can't tell you how many engines I've
torn down and found a couple of old spark plugs wedged somewhere under the
tin. I've had success using a magnet before, but then again the spark plug
is unlikely to hurt anything if you don't get it out, so I wouldn't sweat it
too much.

&gt; I dropped my #1 spark plug during removal.  It is somewhere in between the
&gt; cooling tin and the head somewhere.  What tricks have proven
&gt; successful for those of us who have also done this (I can't be the only
one)?
