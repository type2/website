I don't believe we're talking about the same person.

As I recall not everyone bought his advice - which I always thought was very
good - and sometimes weren't very politic in saying so, including some ad
hominem replies.

&gt; I'm listening to some vintage Paul Harvery episodes while I work.
&gt;
&gt; He's got one episode all about Bob Hoover...
&gt;
&gt; This Bob Hoover is/was quite a pilot.
&gt;
&gt; Is that the same Bob Hoover that used to educate us here so often at Type
2? I sure learned alot from Bob.
&gt;
&gt; Whatever happened to him? I remember the high emotions though I don't
remember the causes.
