Subject: Problems w/ Idle During Warmup

Maybe someone's experienced this and can offer some advice.  When I first
start the bus it runs fine -- idle is a little high and choke is activated.
Once the bus is fully warmed up it runs fine too -- idle at around 900rpm and
choke is open.  The problem is in between those two points.  Once I've driven
off down the road and for about the first 5 minutes (until the bus is fully
warmed up) the bus just won't idle unless I keep a foot on the gas.  Engine is
a 1600 DP, semi-stock (no flaps or tstat), timing is dead on and the carb is
tuned correctly (according to Hoover's field tuning a 34PICT sermon).  Also I
should mention that I've had this problem both with a 009 dizzy and the vac
dizzy I'm using right now.

Any ideas?
