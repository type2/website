&gt;Worth noting in reference to an earlier thread:  On the way home from 
&gt;Columbia about 5 miles south of Macon, Missouri on highway 63 I saw 
&gt;three police cars on the side of the road.  Lights were blaring and 
&gt;they had one car sitting there.  No good.  I have nothing hide but I 
&gt;don't want my bus taken apart.  I was running first in a caravan of 
&gt;four vehicles all running the same speed.  We all changed lanes to the
&gt;left on as a courtesy to the cars parked on the shoulder.  As we got 
&gt;closer an officer started walking into the right lane towards us.  I 
&gt;slowed to probably 45.  As the second car passed she stepped into the 
&gt;lane and waved down cars number 3 and 4.  I, and probably the guy 
&gt;behind me, let out a sigh and continued on our merry way.  I supposed 
&gt;this was some random 'safety check'.  I have heard of them but never 
&gt;seen one in action.

At the Litchfield, CT show earlier this year I overheard a few people
talking about a &quot;safety check&quot; police set up on route 8.  I didn't travel
route 8 that day, but I had to wonder if it was just coincidence that the VW
show was nearby.  Conspiracy theorists can take this thread from here...
