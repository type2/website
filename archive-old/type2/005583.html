PS  If anyone would like to get ahold of him you can pmail me for more info.

Jim told me he has always wanted to tour the country. I guess now is the
time.

&gt;Well, the OldVolksHome is &quot;on the road&quot;. Jim is out touring the country and
&gt;going to a VW show in your home town. He's crusing the interstate in his
&gt;2.1L 84 Westy. Jim plans on being back in California in October. In the
&gt;meantime, you just might see him in your home town at a VW show.
