Subject: Re: [T2] Different Seats

&gt;Has anyone ever put a different kind of front seat in a bay? I was thinking
&gt;something from the Jetta or Gold would be nice. Any body know what would be
&gt;involved to make that work?
&gt;  
&gt;
The simplest upgrade I've considered is going from my Standard bay seats 
in my 76 to some Westy seats... they're a bit nicer.

&gt;I'm curious myself! I have a pair of lovely black leather
&gt;recarro seats from a BMW 325is, that I am wanting to
&gt;install in my '78 westy....
&gt;
I can't blame you.  I've driven in the 325i with recarro seats.  That is 
a nice german driving experience.  Perhaps you could remove the 
rails/mounts from a wrecked car at the yard and weld them into your bus. 
 Pay special attention to heigth and the distance of the seat to the 
wheel and windsheild..  Also keep in mind that driving a bus is much 
different than sedans.  The wheel sits in front of you almost on a 
horizontal plane instead of diagonally.  I just don't know how much 
they'll let you move around.

&gt;also...what was the deal on getting matching material for
&gt;seats? I do really like teh green/brown/tan/black plaid of
&gt;the stock interior, and am thinking of making matcing
&gt;inserts for the recarros...
&gt;
Upholstry places can and will do just about anything for the right 
amount of money.  Looking at car shows or in your VW magazines is proof 
positive of this.  But as I''m sure you know it would definately be a 
custom job.

&gt;it's either
&gt;that or re-cover the rear seat and sleaping pads in black
&gt;leather to match the front seats...
&gt;
The all-black leather westy interior.  You might be on to something there.
