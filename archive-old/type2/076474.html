Subject: Re: [T2] Need a wheel to steer

While we're at it, if anyone has a steering wheel to fit a 74 Bay, I'm in
the market for one in good condition.

Subject: [T2] Need a wheel to steer


&gt; Been trying to repair my sun dried steering wheel on my 75 bus. Seems a
&gt; lost cause. the more I work on it the more it cracks. If I keep this up
&gt; its going to be pure PC7 by the time I'm done. Getting tired of running
&gt; in this circle! Does anyone have a steering wheel for a 75 they are
&gt; willing to part with for a reasonable price that is in decent condition?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Tom
&gt; The Turtlebus will live again
