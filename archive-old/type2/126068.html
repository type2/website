&gt;I have this problem, but I can't boil the tank so I installed a second clear
&gt;fuel filter with a removable element in it between the pump and the tank.  I
&gt;clean it out every few weeks, and seem to be doing okay.  

I did that for a few years. Eventually I was able to go thousands of miles between filter cleanings.
