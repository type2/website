Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Sender For 72 Bus

And how much, pray tell, did this sender cost? The old column sender wasn't
terribly expensive at about $70, but it wasn't cheap either.
Are the sender and guage well matched? In other words, does it say &quot;full&quot;
when it is full, and &quot;half-full&quot; when it's half-full?
I was doing a visual comparison myself and wondering if they would work
interchangeably, both being column senders. I suspect that they are
different heights, thus where the bug one might bolt up and work, the values
might be different. But if the bug sender is not as tall, it would just mean
that you have an awfully big reserve. :)
If it were me, I would rather see if an adapter plate could be made up to
allow insertion and bolt-up of a later year float-type sender.
