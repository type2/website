Subject: A couple of more questions?? and seat for sale.

Was told by a smog guy today that I was leaving too much oxygen and that I
would fail the test. I did not have to pay - that was nice but I am not sure
where to start 1st. I can not find a timing mark on the fan (nor could the
mechanic) but I am not getting any ping and power seems good. I have maybe
50 miles on a new engine and I know that the valves were set when the long
block I bought was built. Runs great!
    The brake light in the dash is constant red. I read about the sensors at
the master cylander, but  they are for the rear brake lights - correct?? At
least the test seems to indicate how to test those lights. I have felt back
behind the dash light and feel wires for all posts on the light. There is a
push button switch at the emergency brake that is missing a wire and I do
see a lose brown wire (ground I assum) but hooking that to the terminal with
no wire does not help.
    The seat for sale is the original rear seat for a 79 bus. I have no room
to store it and the camper conversion has a rear seat. It is in imaculate
condition it is brown.

    Good news the oil pressure seems correct around 15-20 at idle and 40 at
running temp cruising on the highway. When the engine is cold the oil
pressure is higher. Is this because the cooler oil is more viscous??? TIA
