&gt; [T2] OUCH $150 for a mecahnical fuel pump, how about electric?!?!?!?!?
&gt; OUCH!!! That 72 Westy I just mentioned also needs a fuel pump. The two
&gt; least expensive online retailers list the stock mechanical pump $149 &amp;
&gt; $159 !!!!!

or hit the &quot;pick and pull&quot; yards and find one or two, I imagine
&quot;BustedBus&quot; has a decent used one for less....

&gt; you can just use one of the low pressure pumps. busdepot has a few
&gt; different ones from 39.00. no regulator needed.

then add in the relay for safety, and the wiring and blocking off the old
hole, etc, etc.  it will be at least $150 in time and materials...don't
forget to change out ALL of your fuel lines.
