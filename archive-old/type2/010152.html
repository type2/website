Hi folks,

I would like to invite ya'll to come to this years China Cat Festival
thats being held in Jacksonville Florida on August 1st from Noon till
dusk.

WHat is China Cat Festival? Well, it WAS and still is a tribute to the
late Jerry Garcia of the Greatful Dead. We were asked last year to
bring some VWs to the fest. We had atleast 20 Vdubs show up and the
lady incharge of the show was impressed. We asked if it could be
turned into a regular VW show along with what she was doing and she
said yes.

SO, you dont have to be a Deadhead to enjoy. Just bring your Vdub and
or parts to sell.

For more information, please go to this link. You may contact Kathy
for more details. If you are more into the Deadhead stuff, there is a
contact listed too.

Come and enjoy. Help us turn this into a nice VW show for all to njoy.

David
