&gt; Oregon's no self-serve law will probably stand forever, making me realize how

 This particular gas station told me if this
&gt; happened again, and damage occurred, I would be responsible!

I'm no lawyer, but sayin' it's so doesn't make it so! I think there's a
contract there and an implied level of competance. They may have to ask
YOU if there's any special filling instructions they need to know to do
a good job!
