Ok, I've been pouring over the archive, but I still have ...


Questions:

Do I need to prep the bare metal before applying filler, or is that only
for surfaces ready for primer?

For treating bare metal, can I use phosphoric acid and rinse, or do I
need to also use a zinc phosphate solution?

I know I'm not supposed to be using body filler over paint, but does
&quot;paint&quot; here include primer?  So, for example, can I prime using a good
expoxy primer, like PPG DP48 (same as DP40 but white), and then use
filler over it?  I know that some body glazing is designed to be used
over primer (or is it that some primers are designed to be able to take
glazing over them).  BTW, is the glazing like the really soft Bondo
brand red putty in a tube?  Also, if there's a small dent (say, between
one and two inches), before I fill it, do I need to remove the paint on
that spot?


Situation:

I've cut out rust, welded in new metal, and applied body filler to get
the right contour (some of these spots got the POR15 branded &quot;Metal
Ready&quot; treatment, but without rinsing, and others didn't get any at
all).

I also have used my knotted-wire-wheel equiped grinder to grind down to
metal where there where chips that had begun to rust (especially on the
lower front), and on the windshield sill, where there is a little bit of
pitting at the lower corners (but not so much that it seemed a candidate
for welding).  So now, there are some places with body filler that are
ready for some kind of primer, and lots of little spots where I have
gone down to the metal.

Now, I'm not sure if I should spray on some primer-sealer (in this case,
the DP48, but with a different reducer which makes it function as a
sealer), or start with the primer-filler (I'm not sure what the right
PPG product is, especially given that I'm planning to use my brand new
$59.99 Harbor Freight HLVP gun, which comes with a 1.4mm tip [H.F.
#38308-2VGA, those last 4 digits will get you the gun _at_ $39.99]).  For
the small spots, should fill these before or after the primer?  And, in
either case, do I prep the metal first?


The local auto paint house (PPG, no Dupont) hasn't been much help to me,
since, as they put it, they just sell the stuff, they don't paint cars
themselves.

Ok, that's it for the moment.  :  )
