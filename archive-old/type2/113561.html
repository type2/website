Subject: Observational Inspections

How do you know how much is too much or not enough maintenance??? If you 
follow glove box Owner's Manual and Maintenance Manual rules of thumb for 
standard intervals, can you assume that all the rates of WEAR for the way 
you use your car will contribute to the life you expect or the life the 
engineers had in mind?? I say, only if you continue reading and find and 
follow where it says EXTREME CONDITIONS. It tends to require halving all 
intervals for such things as stop and go traffic, short range use, dusty or 
arctic conditions, commercial use, you know the way they are typically used 
in fact by most. It's a rule of thumb approach to a rule of thumb optimum 
use standard which is atypical of the norm in actual use.

Note that every single individual chassis of any makemodelyear in use will 
be used uniquely. It will be subjected to unique events in every way except 
the purpose to travel from A to B. It will be used in a myriad of ways more 
particularly if it is a VW Bus or Van. They can be put to 100's of uses. 
But back to maintenance, how do you know which of two rules of thumb to 
use. I suggest you replace the rules of thumb with observations by 
inspection as the motivating info you need to prove your maintenance is not 
just adequate, but LEAST wasteful of TIME/MONEY to get the CHEAPEST RESULTS 
EXPECTED that can be termed rational.

The CHEAPEST result is the anti-thesis to PREMATURE FAILURE if the goal is 
proper fixin' that stays fixed and even no need of fixin' at all via 
rational observational inspections. That's why you must establish a 
criteria as to what you expect in terms of fixed for now or a little while 
or fixed right. How do we eVALUEate this??? The actual needs of your unique 
chassis for maintenance, repair or restoration are all dependent upon 
actual use, unique in every case. On the other hand is what the owner wants 
or expects. You can know what the vehicle needs by rational inspection 
only. This can't be harmonized with irrational wants or expectations of the 
owner. Of course, the owner is in no place to rationalize anything in a 
state of ignorance. Where does he get the data?? He can get all he needs 
himself with his eyes, nose, fingers and ears. I have found the tongue of 
use very rarely.

Those printed rules of thumb are guides. They are a negotiated compromise 
by and to and between the marketing branch and the engineering branch. They 
cannot hold a candle to maintenance by inspection at the correct intervals 
learned by the notes from the inspections themselves as they progress in 
unique fashion as the miles add up from the show room or that used 
BUSVANEURO with the &quot;new motor&quot; you just bought.

To get started on documenting the proof of correct maintenance for your 
BUSVANEURO for the unique uses you use it will require expense to the tune 
of a $0.39 spiral pad and you could probably visit any golf shop and nab a 
pencil for free. The whole world changes when you start writing things 
down, recording facts for future VALUE, long term VALUE, lowest possible 
cost per mile for indefinite term VALUE, which is the true Scottish CHEAP, 
ie NOTHING WASTED. You have no need of an eraser. If you want perfection of 
function you can get surveyor's books with nicely columned and grids and 
lined and numbered pages. If you want aesthetics cover the book in fabric 
of choice, like say, matching your custom curtains in the Westy. If the 
inspections are going to be unique, so shall the record book be unique. If 
you succeed in getting down the road the distance the engineers had in mind 
when they designed it you will end up with a series of 3 of these 80 page 
books at 300,000 miles with a vehicle in functional order and all 
weaknesses noted for addressing at the next inspection after the parts and 
lubricants have been obtained and verified as suitable to purpose. For 
digital age nerds, you can iPaq it into a data base or spread sheet.

Of VALUE to note is ALL observations. Date, mileage, and notes of 
observations. If you check the oil at every gas fill, note it's level. &quot;1/3 
above add, add half quart&quot;. If you continue you will know in time your rate 
of oil use. If you continue you will know if the rate changes. At your 
convenience you can look into it at the next lube lube change. Also note 
color, smell and texture. Characterize these observations with words on 
paper for future recall. Once you have been 10,000 miles notes down the 
road with your new BUSVANEURO you will know then just how less often is 
required for continued monitoring.

If the oil is dark after only one tank of gas, it's been quickly used up by 
the crud in the engine. It dissolved all the built up crud it could, it's 
fully loaded, it has packed the filter with crud and it's time to reduce 
the rate of wear again after only 300 miles. Change it every 300 miles till 
all the crud is dissolved and removed and you can get perhaps 1000 mile 
intervals before it gets overloaded again. If you feel grit, how do you 
think your cam lobes feel about that??? you waited far too long, no matter 
any rule of thumb. This is just simple demonstration of the principle. If 
observation says change it soon before it gets gritty or another shade 
toward dark, change it like the machine is showing you and ignore rule of 
thumb. You have observed facts as a better indicator of when to schedule 
maintenance.

This principle applied with rigor will double the life of everything on the 
car, insure least possible inconveniences like tow bills to the shop from 
hell, and of the highest VALUE will put you in a position of knowledge such 
that you have no need of wasting TIME/MONEY on any assumptions or guesses. 
If someone asked, &quot;How often do you change your oil??&quot; You could reply, 
&quot;Precisly as often as is required to prevent excess wear rates.&quot; How do you 
do that? Via observation and notes.

Another note on the principle. If you anticipate by observed weaknesses an 
upcoming issue and take care of it at the next inspection it's not a 
component failure, it's not repair, it's replacement via maintenance 
inspection. With proper inspections for the way you use your car you can 
watch the compression balance and know a year ahead of any failure to 
replace it as a matter of the next inspection. Rule of thumb throws the 
door open to unexpected failure. Observational Inspections done properly 
rules then out. The difference is just that distinct.

The only other low hassle option is 3 or 5 times as expensive for a million 
miles of service. Buy a new car, run it under light use maintenance rules 
of thumb until it starts needing repair a few years out of warranty then 
sell it or trade it for a new car. It will take you 5 or 6 cars at least to 
make a million miles if you run stop and go and hold to 7500 miles 
suggested light duty rule of thumb inspection intervals that are not even 
inspections, just oil changes.

And if you dutifully log all your gas as well, you will see that if you in 
fact run 20,000 miles on your spark plugs then change them, your gas 
mileage will show an increase measurable over time, even though rule of 
thumb says 30,000.  Monitoring your gas use and noting changes in the 
numbers over time is a superior diagnostic tool of high VALUE in 
anticipating and resolving the issue prior to wasting gas/money that is 
better used to maintain a better rate.

There is simply no such thing as too much data. Paper is cheap, use lots of it.
