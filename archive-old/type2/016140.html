Subject: 72 Dual Carbs
Message-ID: &lt;33001c3.249b041a_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I own a 72 campmobile(1800cc, dual 34's) that has been spectacular.  I do 
most of my own work but draw the line at carbeurators.  I took Buelah to my 
somewhat trusted mechanic who told me that they couldn't be adjusted any 
better.  He said that the connection between the carbs and linkage was worn 
and there was nothing to do but replace them.  I'm sure somebody out there 
has heard of this.

If I do indeed need new carbs, my gut feeling is to go with dual webers.  I 
could sure use some advice.
