Hi;
   This is a bit of parental anxiety surfacing. My daughter is driving
&gt;from Socorro New Mexico to Clovis N.M. today, returning Monday. Any New
Mexico listees in the general vicinity of I-25 &amp; I-40 (the intended
route, I believe), or traveling listees on those roads, please keep an
eye out for a &quot;Smurf Blue&quot; '77 Baja Bug. Lend her a hand if she appears
to be experiencing troubles. Shouldn't be a problem, but I worry anyhow.
We rebuilt the 1600 DP summer of '98, it's well broken in and she is
fully aware of the mantra, &quot;check the oil, check the oil, check the
oil&quot;...

   Anyhow, thanks to anybody in the area that could perform some
roadside assistance if necessary.

   Now (mandatory Bus content), I'm working on the engine out of my '78
Westy and noticed what appears to be a case bolt missing on the top
front of the engine (Front is front), right behind the lip of the case
where it bolts up to the tranny. Does a bolt go there? The hole is
currently unoccupied.

Thanks;
