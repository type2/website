Subject: Re: [T2] Oil temp guage question

Theoretically plastic does suffer in heat and cold. In practice I have
never heard anyone complain of this kind of failure. Try running over
a garden hose when it is frozen and watch it break to pieces. Or how
often have you handled old sun-bleached hose and had it snap in your
hands. How long does it take to get to that point? I don't know, but
it is obviously something you would manage like old fuel hoses.

Don't forget pressure decreases with lenth of hose too.

 Has anyone installed a mechanical oil pressure guage that uses the plastic
 hose to extend the oil pressure to the guage? Is that hose any good? I have
 about 5 ft of it and fittings from a mechanical guage I use for spot checking
 oil pressure on engines that don't gave a guage. I am considering using about
 a foot of it to make an extension hose for my electrical oil pressure guage,
 only because I've discovered the VDO hose is NLA!
 
 Does the plastic get brittle with heat/extreem cold? The last thing I want is
 to spring an oil gusher on a newly rebuilt engine.
