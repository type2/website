Subject: Re: [T2] praise for online vendor

While I haven't bought anything from you yet, I am
sure that next year I will be doing most of my parts
purchases online.  My local shop will be closing due
to retirement sometime next year.  This shop will be
sorely missed as it is just down the road from where I
work and I can take my lunch and run to get parts.
I did get good service from Bus Boys, but you all are
so far away.  (my only gripe, but it can't be helped
*sigh*)
Keep up the good work and stick around... a year isn't
long.
