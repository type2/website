Subject: Re: Utilizing all available storage space.

&gt; Finally, has anyone found a way of utilizing the &quot;battery tray&quot; area on the
&gt; left hand side of the engine compartment (without blocking airflow of course).
&gt; It seem like this space could be used to store something?

Yes, I use this area to store my 2nd battery ;-)
