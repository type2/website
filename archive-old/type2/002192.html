Subject: Tent Poles Stolen

Recently someone broke in to my garage and  primarily took sporting goods,
but they also took the tent poles for my '72 side tent .  -- All I could
figure is that they were in a nice bag and the guy thought they we something
else (besides very heavy).

Has anyone fabricated a new set of poles or have a set they are looking to
sell?  Please let me know. Thanks
