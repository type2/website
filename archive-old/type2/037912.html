Subject: Need front passanger side door

I am in the process of restoring a 77 Westy and I need to replace the front
passenger side door. I have searched Idaho for a door without luck. Anyone
with a clean, rust free door please contact me and I will see what's
involved in getting it to Idaho.

Thanks.
