Subject: Re: [T2] '79 bus engine tin needed - hot running

Brian,

Large hole in tin===  very hot

Bus depot or joe at bustedbus_dot_com

Got my replacement from Joe, along with the part of the body that gets
cut out as well.

When I rebuild my engine I will use the new rotary compressor setup.

Cheers, dave

&gt; After about 2 years in the driveway I have finally resurrected my '79 Westy.
&gt; A rebuilt transmission, and engine (balanced), plus soundproofing. The bus
&gt; hums nicely courtesy of a bunch of acoustic foam, blankets, and damping
&gt; material from left over failed aircraft acoustic testing.
&gt; 
&gt; My bus is running much hotter than before. It gets up to about 250F whereas
&gt; it used to run about 210F with the old engine. I think my cooling flaps are
&gt; stuck due to excess friction and a weak spring, but the flaps appear to be
&gt; stuck in the open position. The wire from the thermostat attaches to a tab
&gt; on the flaps rod. That tab points up (not forward), can someone confirm that
&gt; that is the position for OPEN?
&gt; 
&gt; I removed the dead A/C from the bus during the rebuild, so now I have a big
&gt; hole where the A/C used to be. This is probably the main cause of my hot
&gt; engine since the hole is right above the cat converter ('79 CA) bus. Does
&gt; anyone have this missing piece of engine tin (left rear, upper) that they
&gt; can sell to me? 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
