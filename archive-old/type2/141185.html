Subject: RE: [T2] re:PLF

&gt; blah. it comes down to making a product,
&gt; by hand, rather than buying and selling
&gt; someone else's labor. dawn does IT; bus
&gt; depoo does something else.


Wow, where the heck did that come from?

If you think that tracking down obscure parts or tooling from all over the
globe for 30 year old vehicles that most manufacturers forgot about decades
ago is as simple as &quot;buying and selling someone else's labor,&quot; than you are
naove. It's a detective game just to find a lot of this stuff, and then you
have to convince them to produce it and make sure it's right.  (Ratwell
could vouch for that, having done it with the Koni shocks.) Why do you think
the full-line commodity auto parts retailers only cherry-pick the
easy-to-get Bus stuff?  Not that I'm bragging - many people do it besides
me, and do it well - but don't trivialize that which you don't know. Many
things look easy to someone who doesn't know any better. Perhaps your line
of work would as well, to an outsider who hadn't actually done it.

Besides that has nothing to do with my comment, which - quite ironically -
was to second Dawn's comment about how friendly so many Bus folk are.

Oh, and by the way, it's Bus Depot, not Depoo. :-)
