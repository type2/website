Subject: Splittie DblDr at Metal Melters Neb/IA

Hi All,

A report just came in that a Splittie Dbl Door Panel is currently at a
metal melters in Council Bluffs, IA (near Omaha, Nebraska).

It has a cab divider and some other items.  A net-connected buddy is
willing to rescue some parts if anything is needed. Let me know via email
and I'll put you in touch with him.  Sorry, we don't know the year as of
yet, but I knew of a primered 58 up there and it may be the same one. It
was used as a dog house at an import junkyard for decades. 8-/
