Subject: Cost estimate: Repack the bearings

I am in Tucson Arizona. I had my front driver's side inner and outer bearing
replaced by my mechanic for $82.75, parts, labor etc. Don't know if I paid
too much or not. I don't care. Anything that close to my butt better work
right. Make sure they just need repacking and not replacement (the bearings).
