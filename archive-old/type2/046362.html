Subject: [T2] New vs. old parts?

I am trying to fix up a 74 Westy and need some parts. 
I contacted someone who said he had parts for sale, but his asking price
is higher than what the vendors charge for new parts. Whaen I contacted
him and told him this, his response was &quot;I take it you never bought new
parts before or you wouldn't even
consider them.  The price I gave is non-negotiable, SORRY.
THANKYOU for you inquiry, DAN.&quot;

Is there something that I need to know about new replacement parts?
Not looking for a show bus, just a reliable vehicle.
