Subject: Injection problems - maybe the fuel pressure?

Dear all,

I (my 16 yr old son, actually) bought a 1977 Westy recently. It wasn't 
running when we got it. We rebuilt the engine. It's in the bus now, but 
doesn't start. It cranks like mad, there's voltage in all the right places, 
and a VOM on the injector resistors shows a needle at 12V when not 
cranking, and bouncing around when cranking. From this I infer that the 
computer is turning the injectors on. And our spare computer does exactly 
the same thing.

Disconnecting the fuel line and making the pump run into a jar produces a 
bit less than a quart each 30 seconds, which is about 2 liters/minute.

But the spark plugs seem dry and there's no apparent fuel vapor coming out 
the tail pipe. I guess this suggests the injectors aren't spitting out the 
fuel. Perhaps one or two could be bad but it's hard to believe they all 
are. So is this likely a fuel pressure problem? We don't have a gauge, but 
will try and get one.

But... how will that help? If the pressure is too low, what can we do about 
it? The fuel pressure regulator appears unadjustable.

This has been a fun project and has brought back memories of living in my 
old '70 bus for a year a very long time ago. But fuel injection is new to 
me, and I'm running out of ideas.

Any thoughts, anyone?

Thanks much,
Jack
