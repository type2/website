Lealon-
This problem is quite common. There is a relay kit made by Bosch that
overrides the weakness in the wireing of the Bus. It is called: WR1 Low
Voltage Relay Kit (Bosch). I got one from Ron at Bus Depot and had it in my
box of things to do. The problem began to reappear so I followed the easy
instructions and installed it. Problem gone. The kit is very inexpensive.
Double check to be sure it works in a '71.
