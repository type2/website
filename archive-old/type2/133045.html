Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel injectors / pressure - cycle the injectors

Guys,

There are some plans out there for making one of these bench testers at 
your house...

injector pulses are typical measured in milliseconds..so I doubt if a 
flasher would be a good idea.


Think about it for awhile though.  Hi pressure fuel pump, some sort of 
controller(megasquirt?), lots of hi pressure hose and some sort of liquid
to blow thru them that is the same viscosity of gasoline , but *NOT* 
explosive....and that doesn't count whatever you want to use to clean them 
with...*also* *not* explosive.

As Richard pointed out yesterday, probably safer and cheaper to send them 
off and get them tested, cleaned and matched...seems like for about 
$15..$20 each.

Other than the quickie test to see if they work or not...seems better to 
have a &quot;professional&quot; do this one.

Cheers, dave

&quot;I'm more interested in getting it right, than being right&quot;....dave

&gt; 
 is planning to make a board setup to test fuel 
&gt; injectors, and he is considering using an emergency flasher unit to provide 
&gt; the pulses.
&gt; 
&gt; Comments??
