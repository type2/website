Subject: Re: [T2] EGR

&gt; A) If I get the mixture adjusted for daily driving with the EGR stuff
&gt; blocked, it would run rich when I unblocked it for the smog check.

The ONLY mixture adjustment you have is at idle.
EGR ONLY works at part throttle......
The injectors inject the same amount of fuel, whether EGR is working or not,
the ECU has no feedback to know if EGR is open or closed.

&gt; B) If I get the mixture adjusted for the smog test, it would then run too
&gt; lean after the smog was done and I block off EGR again for daily use.

No it won't. See A above.


&gt; Does anybody have any idea if:
&gt;
&gt; Plan A) would be too rich to pass smog?

The mixture would not change off idle. But you will run the risk of failing
the test if they test for NOx [oxides of nitrogen].
EGR lowers the combustion temps.

&gt; Plan B) would be lean enough to harm the engine?&gt;

Again, unless you change the operating pressure of the fuel or change the ohm
value of the cylinder head temp sensor, there is NO mixture adjustment you
could do off-idle.

&gt; This should be interesting...

It would be more interesting if you understood how L-Jetronic and emission
controls worked......
