Subject: PO's and type 3's

Well I got the 68 westy's engine torn down. PO did it too me again, I've
never seen a rod bearing look like that or a crank more seized. Looks like
line bore and fresh turned crank and rods. Unfortunately here in the Great
White North, rebuilt heads are unheard of and new is required.

Which brings me to a question, I've a good type 3 universal case which gives
me the correct holes for the moustache bar so all I need to do is get a
plate to cover the oil filler hole and tap for the oil sender. What I'm not
sure of is how to deal with a dip stick. Do you drill a whole for the tube?
Anybody else done this? Lastly does anyone know off the top of their heads
the thread for the oil sender.
thanks all
Chuck
