Hi Volks!

&gt; The offlist traffic to my mailbox overwhelming supports engine

Including me?  Let me clarify:

I don't support them, I just fail to condemn them as strictly
as you do.  But to each his own -- you keep not liking watercooled
Baywindows, and I keep not liking hacked-up home-brew campers.
Deal?  ;-)

&gt; It has even crossed the line from a sort of libertarianism
&gt; (&quot;if I want to do this no one has the right to stop me&quot;) that is sort
&gt; of the soul of this list over to a matter of logic (&quot;the conversion
&gt; makes sense&quot;).

Volkswagen themselves made watercooled Buses -- Diesels in 
Germany and Brazil, watercooled Boxers in Germany, inline
four petrol engines in Mexico and South Africa, inline five
petrol engines in South Africa.  Volkswagen does not seem to
have had any second thoughts about this, when the chance
arose they took it.  I fail to see why an owner should not
do likewise, if they so desire.

&gt; So I cry uncle. I'm a retro grouch.

Me too.  I just *hate* after-market high roofs.  :-)
 
&gt; I do hate to watch the decline of an appreciation for what VW achieved
&gt; in these vehicles, though.

Appreciation moves in mysterious ways.  Some of us alter their
Buses' exterior, some (many) the interior, some the mechanics,
some the ride height -- and some, like me, buy 'em for a couple
hundred, keep 'em stored for years, decline any offers to buy
from people who plan on hacking 'em up and in the end give 'em
away to other Volks who promise not to.  Been there, done that.

But I *still* prefer a lowered, high roof, Porsche engined,
hacked-window, pink metallic with neon green bumpers, ex-panel 
makeshift camper with cut rear wheel wells and 235 tyres on
Mercedes alloy wheels over a 100% original Bus that was junked 
and replaced with a Mitsubishi L 300 because of its sluggish 
performance uphill.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
