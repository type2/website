Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone have a spare weber single?? (FI reversion
  update)

Hi Jeff,

I removed the head so someone else could pull the studs. I was **way** 
too busy to look after this myself. The studs were stripped so I 
wouldn't  be able to remove them with a pair of nuts on the stud, and 
any removal more advanced than that requires tools I don't currently 
have. They wound up needing helicoils anyway, so I would have been 
pulling the head to send them out regardless. Or I suppose I could take 
the whole engine in, but I can't lift it into my station wagon 
alone....  I am not bad with regular maintenance, but I draw the line 
at machining. This is a case where paying a pro to do the work is 
cheaper than learning on my own engine. At least that's how I see it.

I did the pushrod tubes on the 3-4 side with the engine back in the 
bus, and you're right, it wasn't any harder than it was with the engine 
on the ground. The main reason the engine came down was to swap the 
5-rib tranny for a 3-rib. I wanted to get the top gear ratio down a bit 
to improve performance on long hills while pulling the westrailer, and 
the 4th gear on the 5-rib tranny was starting to whine a bit under 
load.

Fahrfenugen?? OMG, last night I thought I was going to have to dig out 
my right eye and rinse it in the sink. It feels a lot better today 
though.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Just for some trivial information (next time) I don't believe you need
&gt; to remove the engine to accomplish this task on the 1.7L through 2.0L.
&gt; If you remove the tin plates and exhaust manifolds from underneath the
&gt; bus, you can re-tap the exhaust studs in the heads from M8x1.25 to
&gt; M10x1.5 while the heads are still in place.  If you search the hardware
&gt; stores you can find metric studs with the M10x1.5 threading on one end
&gt; and M8x1.25 on the other end.  The will need to be 46 to 50 mm long.
&gt;
&gt; As for push rod tube seals, I believe the push rods simply slide out
&gt; once you remove the keeper springs and the rocker arms.  You intended
&gt; to adjust the valves anyway...
&gt;
&gt; This may be one of those tasks where you get Fahrfenugen in your eyes
&gt; but the job is not difficult and doesn't take much time.
