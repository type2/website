&gt; A lot of the time on long trips I will also try to save gas by

&gt; some of the resistance recede.

Reminds me of the commercial with the nascar drivers sitting in a
driver's ed class.  The instructor (cop) asks &quot;what is
the proper following distance&quot; and one of the drivers pops up with &quot;two or
three inches&quot;  :)

Drafting does work, and I've crossed the Mojave against a stiff headwind
by drafting about 100 feet behind a semi.  I couldn't even maintain
cruising speed without the draft, but with it I got my normal mileage.
