Subject: OT, FS Dented 79 MB 300td

Other than the fact this is about a German car and it's cheap this is off 
topic so I apologize in advance.

Mama stopped for an ambulance but the ford van behind didn't so we've got a 
seriously dented 79 Mercedes wagon that I'm offering for $750. The front 
bumper of the ford overrode the wagon's and now the tailgate is essentially 
perma-shut. Also took out both tail lights and the rear glass.  I drove it 
home from the tow lot.

This car now has 191,000 on it but was completely overhauled, both engine and 
trans, 10,000 ago and repainted by the former owner whose estate I bought it 
from. 

This could be of interest to someone who needed a motor and trans or a snappy 
looking wagon with smashed tail to drive another 200,000 miles. It's just not 
a family cruiser anymore.

Oh yeah, there is a euro type hitch suitable for towing vw's.

Thanks,

Weston
