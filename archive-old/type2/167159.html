Subject: golf cart batteries

I have heard on and off they make good accessory batteries when running two 
together.
They take to being recharged over and over well.

Anyone else considering doing this for their second battery? Anyone who has 
already?
What was the cost difference between doing this and simply getting a deep 
cycle battery?

Seriously interested.
