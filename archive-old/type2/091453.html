Subject: Re: [T2] re: oil filter pancake 2.0 liter

If you can wait for mail order Bus depot &amp; I'm sure others carry
Mahle &amp; Mann. I got a pack of the Mahle filters. These make anything
you can pick up at a local FLAPS	look like the POS they are. They are
truely high quality filters. go with one of these brands.
