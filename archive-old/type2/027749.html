The guy I bought my loaf from is a drummer....he was selling it to go to UNY 
to work on his performance master. I myself am a guitar player. I would 
guess the attraction is the ease of throwing you gear in the bus and going 
to the gig. Plus, they're way cool!  =^)

Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?

&gt;Howdy,
&gt;There is something strange that I noticed around my
&gt;town... I know of four baywindows in Crossville, TN,
&gt;three of which are owned by drummers, including
&gt;myself. Another drummer I know is also planning on
&gt;buying one, making four out of five owned by drummers.
&gt;Does this strange phenomenon occur
&gt;elsewhere? I consider myself a fairly accomplished
&gt;drummer, having received a sizely scholership from
&gt;Tennessee Tech's music department beginning this fall.
&gt;One of the other baywindows is owned by a VERY
&gt;accomplished drummer... Are any other bus
&gt;owner/drummers out there? What is it that draws
&gt;drummers to Volkswagens?
&gt;                                   Thanks,
&gt;                                   Paul Deatherage
