Subject: New Owners, '72 blue and white bus

Hello Friends,

We just purchased a '72 blue and White bus in great shape for a vehicle of
this age.  all original as far as I know with a 1700 cc pancake, 4 speed,
68K original miles.  It is getting a new middle set and other things.  we
hope to be picking it up in a week or so.

Bob H.
