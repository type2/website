   I realize this may be a Friday subject, but this just happened this morning.  There was a VW gathering rather close to where I live and I decided to drive out there to meet a few other VW enthusists.  We have not had our VW during a camping season and this was my first outing with it.  I pulled in, got out, walked up and said Hello to several people (members of the club) and proceeded to look at the cars on display, (mostly beetles, one type2) and was not spoken to the entire time I was there.  So, I finished looking walked back to my 78 Westy and drove off.  I sure hope other clubs are friendlier than this one seems to be.
Thanks for allowing me to vent my frustrations
(was looking forward to an afternoon of relaxing and visiting)
