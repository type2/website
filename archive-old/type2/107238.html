Subject: Re: [T2] Boltless in Augusta...

&gt; Stafford Nut and Bolt (though they may have renamed).  Take riverwatch
&gt; downtown and onto Jones, pass Redmond's upolstery on your right, then

And if you need upolstery work done, Redmond is the man to do it.
For upolstery supplies keep going down to the old furniture warehouse at
the end of Jones, behind the TV station.

The lady that runs it (unless it's changed hands for some reason) is
great.  Tell her that the red/white bus driver that worked for the sunroof
shop says hi.
