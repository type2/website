&lt;&lt; Hello Vincent  Could be like me working on them since I was 9 years old, 
rebuilt first motor when I was 14 , Rumor has it instead of a silver spoon I 
was 
born with a snap-on 13 mm wrench :)   This list is great for any problem you 
could have with your bus  later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import

Try &lt;&lt;  www.motorbooks_dot_com  &gt;&gt; for an overview of some basic books
on auto systems...Luckily, air cooled VW's just touched the electronics
revolution in auto technology (FI...), so almost all the systems are mech-
canical and accessable to eyeballing...Once you break down the vehicle
to separate systems, the diagnoses and repair becomes &quot;logical&quot; in the
customary sense...Use a pyramid scheme to ferret out problems...
Start with the easiest (Do you really have gas?), before rebuilding the
carb... ;-)
