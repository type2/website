Subject: 79' Westy Auxillary Battery Hookup

In 6 hours, I'm taking my 79' Westy which I got two months ago on the road 
camping. When I got it, it did not have the auxillary battery (that runs the 
fridge, etc). I got a new battery last night. When I went to put it in, I  
figured out really quick that I couldn't decipher where all of the wires 
connected (there looks to be more than needed to hook up the battery hanging 
around loose). If someone could tell me what wires need to be hooked where, 
I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks,
Jared
