List:

Just went to the Raby site referenced in the July issue of VW Trends.
Very interesting offerings and opinions for those interested. In
particular,Raby sells a &quot;Powerstroke&quot; 2165cc motor (stock 1.8 liter heads, 
78.4 mm crank) that he makes some pretty strong claims for. See for
yourself at:

I also found the FAQ section most interesting.  This guy HATES 
hydraulic lifters and will not build with them.  He also is building very 
high CRs into his motors, at least compared to AVP and Bob Donalds.  Anyway,
I just wanted to pass on some interesting info and potential services--
I'll probably call next week and see what he charges for his motors and his
cryogenic treatments...Anybody had any experience with him or his motors??
