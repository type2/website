Subject: Re: [T2] Still having problems with clutch install...

Does the pressure plate have a ring on fingers in the center?
Does the transaxle have a tube that the throw-out bearing rides on?
It is hard to see what you have mis-matched.....
70 should have no tube, so it should have a ring on the pressure plate and a
flat-faced bearing.
If you have a tube, you should have no ring and a curved face bearing. This
bearing holder is longer to make up the distance for no ring on the plate.
The flat side of the disc goes towards the flywheel.
The side where the center hub is farther out from the friction material goes
to the plate side.


&gt; I'm really hoping there's a clutch guru online today. I posted yesterday
&gt; about problems with my clutch install -- replaced throwout bearing, clutch
&gt; plate and disc. Put everything back together and all I got was a
&gt; whirring/grinding noise when I let out the clutch pedal (in gear only), bus
&gt; didn't move except in reverse and even then it sounded like it was eating
&gt; itself.
&gt;
&gt; My bus is a 1970 with a Mexican 1600 and standard 3-rib tranny.
&gt;
&gt; Okay, so I must not have put it together correctly, yes? Removed engine
&gt; again, inspect everything, notice some metal filings lining the tranny case.
&gt; Also notice the teeth on the clutch disc are a little chewed up. Removed the
&gt; plate and disc to compare to originals. Plates match up fine, but the discs
&gt; are different. New one has four springs (old one has six), and the piece
&gt; that mates with the shaft from the tranny is shorter than the original. I'm
&gt; no Einstein, but I could see that the new one is not the correct part, so I
&gt; put the old disc back in, reassembled everything, fired her up and tried to
&gt; get her to move. Nothing. Same problem as yesterday -- makes a
&gt; whirring/grinding noise (chewing up the teeth on the clutch disc, I'm sure)
&gt; and won't move.
&gt;
&gt; Someone (Karl, I think?) suggested I had the disc in backwards -- it wasn't.
&gt; I also checked the free play of the clutch pedal and that's fine (even tried
&gt; adjusting it up and down, but it didn't help).
&gt;
&gt; Am I missing something here when I mate the tranny and motor back up? It
&gt; seems like the shaft isn't coming together with the clutch disc correctly.
&gt; The throwout bearing is brand new and installed according to Bentley
&gt; yesterday -- looked okay today while I had it all apart. Also, the shaft
&gt; looks fine -- no visible damage, anyways.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas? I need to get this done today since this is my daily driver, so
&gt; quick replies are verrry welcome!
