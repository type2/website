Subject: Re: Oil Cooler / 

Should I install an auxillary oil cooler or is the
&gt;stock external oil cooler good enough?


I'm no expert BY ANY MEANS, but a fellow listee (sorry, bro, I can't
remember who it was, I'm embarrassed) correctly predicted that my temps
would drop and stay there once I sealed up the engine compartment good and
proper.  That included two new battery trays and new hatch and deck rubber.
Once I did, my temp went down 25 degrees and I've had absolutely no trouble
at all.  Now, I don't do cross country tours, either, and Michigan is not
Arizona.  But I highly recommend getting your engine area back to
ventilation spec.  It costs almost nothing and you can do it with out engine
work per se.  And your engine stays prettier looking, too, with out the road
grit making it's way in past the hot muffler.

In fact, my extra cooler is sitting in a box in the garage.
