Subject: End float... For Real This Time :-)
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Thanks to all you kind folks who didn't laugh too hard when it turned out 
that my .086&quot; end float was *without* the flywheel in place :-) I then went 
into the manuals and learned how the end float is controlled, which is what I 
should have done before winding up the list. Sorry, folks.

Engine is a 1.8 L dual carb. Now I have the flywheel on and torqued. The end 
float is .008&quot;, repeatable, checked with a dial indicator.

Spec calls for .003-.005&quot;, wear limit .006&quot;. So we are high by .002&quot;... 
doesn't seem like much, but that amounts to +33% in addition to the wear 
limit. 

We have a 2.0l EFI engine that we are going to rebuild from bare cases, so we 
are planning this current engine for a max of 30K mile *reliable* life.  What 
is the downside to leaving float at .008&quot;?
