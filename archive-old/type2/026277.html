I had to put crappy Dansk heat exchangers on last August (now Just
Kampers have genuine ones for less money [mutter mutter]).  The heat
output is virtually non-existent at the front even though my ducting is
all in place, because most of the air leaks out of the gaps between the
inner finned part of the exchangers and the cover.
Anyone have a solution to this one?  I've thought of plugging the gaps
with something but some of them are impossible to get at without taking
the whole thing apart.

&gt; Good heat (and mine is very good) requires intact heater boxes and a
&gt; leak
&gt; free ducting system to the front of the bus.
