Subject: Re: [T2] Lapping cylinders to heads?

&gt;Anyway, does anybody have any strong opinions pro or con about this process?
&gt;I take it it's simply a matter of putting a small amount of valve lapping
&gt;compound on the top of the cylinder and then gently rotating the cylinder
&gt;back and forth in its head?

Yes. Clean, clean, clean afterwards.

I do it each time.

Dunno if it is necessary but it's peace of mind for me.
