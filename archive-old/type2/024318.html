...that is the question. I set my 74 1800, dual carbs, stock, to 10* ATDC static as suggested in Muir &amp; Bentley. Now it runs terribly! It had been previously set to 4* BTDC and ran well, with the exception of the low idle miasma I'm puzzling through.

As I shot it with a timing light &amp; accelerated, the notch seems to advance and retard well enough--up to 10* BTDC or so (I didn't check this in detail.) While driving, the engine coughs, sputters, bucks and pops, particularly after shifting into 3rd. Didn't do that with the 4* BTDC setting--just a mild backfire on decel and slight run-on after the ignition was switched off.

Why do you suppose it runs better at BTDC than at ATDC? Any suggestions appreciated as I try to fix a series of leaks, boo-boos and mysteries the PO left behind.
