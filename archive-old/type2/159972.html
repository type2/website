Instead  of rebuilt, EMPI makes new [all new parts] complete  axles.

Hey Karl   I just got a new empi for an 1990 audi 80  5 sp  non quattro  It 
was too long as they only make them for autos.  I  couldn't find an axle 
anywhere so I took the empi apart and installed all the  parts on the old axle 
shaft, little more work but a lot cheaper than buying the  seprate parts new.
