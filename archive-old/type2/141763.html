Subject: RE: [T2] '79 Westy Wiring

Thanks Greg for that info, it really helps - it's beginning to make sense!

So, I've done some more tracing and, as best as I could tell, it appears
that the PO (or their mechanic) has done some wiring changes.  Here's what
I've found:

1) My big red wire is no longer connected to the fuse panel; it is stuffed
under the driver's seat. (Can you tell which fuse yours is connected to?)
2) The other end is &quot;lost&quot; behind my cabinets.  I'd like to give it a pull,
but I'm a bit concerned that it might be connected to something else... PO's
can be a PIA!
3) They've tapped into the fridge power wire (between the battery/city
switch and the fridge power switch) - so that the sink now gets its power
from the aux battery or city power.

Thanks again to you all for your help.

Regards,

Wayne
'79 Westy

Wayne, on my 79 westy, the big red wire under the
driver's seat goes from the back of the fuse box, to
an in-line fuse holder behind/under the steering
wheel, under the front floor mat, under the driver's
seat under the cabinets and comes up under the sink. 
It's connected to the sink pump only.  But then I
don't have a deluxe camper with the stove and fridge. 
I hope this helps.  Greg
