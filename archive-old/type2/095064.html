Subject: Passing smog check: got a problem (Type4 FI 1975 1.8L)

Friends: I'd appreciate some advice on how to reduce HC at high rpm (2500+) 
so as to pass a California smog test(Passes at idle). I've already changed 
the oil, replaced and set the points (dwell at 44 degrees), and put in new 
plugs (Champion Platinum #3322 gapped to 0.024 and torqued to 20 ft-lbs.); 
timing set at 5 ATDC.
I notice one symptom: when revving the engine slowly to 2500+, just as it 
gets to 2500 (and above) the tapping noise from one of the valves (sounds 
like from either the #1 or the #2 cylinder) gets louder and the rpm 
decreases slightly, requiring more throttle to maintain that rpm. (This 
might be defined as a 'miss', I guess).  I recently replaced the pushrod 
tube seals, and after reassembly of the rockers, reset the valves (.006); 
but then again I'm not sure that one of them might not be a bit off.* Would 
a valve gap being 'off' cause the increased noise/ decrease in rpm/ excess 
HC at 2500+ rpms, or is there another possibility to investigate?
Two years ago it passed smog with some to spare. The engine is totally stock 
with about 85k miles on it and is otherwise running smoothly and with good 
power and economy. I also checked temp sensor II. Have not opened the AFM, 
ever. Vacuum hoses seem to be o.k.
*Used go-no go gauges; question: at 85k is it possible for there to be 
pitting or hollowing of a valve stem/rocker interface such that a  feeler 
gauge isn't giving an accurate reading of the gap?
Thanks for any ideas you might have to offer.
