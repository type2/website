&gt; You should be using Super (93) anyway, on your Jetta. All VWs (and any other European vehicles) were made to run on the higher octane. (Just read the owners manuals)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  PEACE OUT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

If you read a bit more, you'll find that the octane numbers they use in
Europe are usually found using the Research method (the &quot;R&quot; in &quot;RON&quot;)
while those in the US are found using the Motor method.  The government,
in a schitzoid compromise, tells the oil companies to average the two
methods, yielding a number that is of little use to anyone.
