Subject: Re: [T2] 6 rib trans into 74 bus.

Hi Paul,
        Never counted the ribs and can't directly answer your question. However the 002 transaxle  used through 75 and the 091
transaxle used 76  through 79  have compatible bell housings that will mate up to the type 4 engine.  They are also all nose
shifters. The 091 (80-83.5)  and the 091-1 (83.5 -91) have compatible bell housings but are  side shifters. It is also possible to
swap bell housings between models.
    I use a South African 5 speed bell housing to adapt the 091 transaxle on my 78 westy to an i5 audi engine.

Darrell

Subject: [T2] 6 rib trans into 74 bus.


&gt; Hi All. I have the chance to buy a 2l fi engine and 6 rib trans to replace
&gt; the 1800 carbed engine and auto trans I currently have in my 74 bus. What I
&gt; need to know is how much drama it is going to be to make this combo fit with
&gt; the 6 rib trans? I remember seeing some where that a 3 or 5 rib trannies are
&gt; the only ones that will fit into this model. Why is this? is it something to
&gt; do with the trans to chassis mount? if so is it possible to fabricate an
&gt; adaptor? I am not worried about setting up a shifter or the FI etc at this
&gt; stage, just whether I can bolt this setup in.
&gt; I Have searched the archives and gone through the library drive train
&gt; section to no avail. any info would be much appreciated
&gt; Regards to all.
&gt; Paul.
