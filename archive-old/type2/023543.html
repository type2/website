Subject: cooling fan... 71...how can you tell
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I am about to send (a) my cooling fan to Gene Berg for welding and balancing.

I want to send the one for my doghouse cooler set-up... but after years of
disassembly and many moves I don't know which fan is the right one.

I heard they can be measured...(and the bigger [thicker] one should be the
1971)

Is this so ???
