Subject: Re: [T2] What about diesel conversions?

I'll never understand why some people would want to have to handle used
cooking grease, surely it needs to be strained first to remove any food
particles?

Personally I find used cooking grease to be one of the most nusauting
substances I come across in daily life! I hate cleaning up that stuff. I'd
rather spend that time earning money to buy gas, rather then spend that time
collecting and straining used cooking grease! yuk.

It might make sense in an industrial application or something but for a
personal vehicle? No way, not for me!
