Subject: how many bearing dowels?

Hi all,

I looked through the archives but could not get a clear answer.

I called my machine shop yesterday to confirm they had some parts that I
was missing this weekend. The smart machinist took some parts out, the
distributor driveshaft and main bearing dowels, and forgot to give them
back. That made for a frustrating weekend. Anyway, he tells me he has
the driveshaft and three (3) dowels. Aren't there four (4)dowels? I
would just look at my case but it is in another town at the place I am
working on it. I'm going to pick these last parts up tomorrow and want
to make sure I have everything from him. The case is a 1600 dual relief.

Thanks,

Max Bronsema
