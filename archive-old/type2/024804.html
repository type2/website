Hello All!

     I'm getting a new muffler, and related parts, and was thinking of
having it coated with the high heat por-15, but a couple of people I
know showed me there's they did( one on a ghia(done a year ago), the
other a baja(done 6 month ago), and both show sign's of rust. So now I
wonder if this is really that good(by the way both were bead blasted,
and then they followed directions.). So is this normal? Do I plan on
coating it every year? Any other suggestions? I want it to last as long
as I can. As always Thanks for all info!

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
