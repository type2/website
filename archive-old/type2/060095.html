Subject: vw theft prevention

In response to  everyone who has been talking about vw theft,personally I don't really worry about mine, and it's in pretty good shape. Think about it, if someone was going to steal a car, why a VW? I feel that if someone took my camper they wouldn't even be able to get it into gear, let alone down the street. They're one of the hardest cars to drive(especially standards). And have you ever tried to follow someone in an old VW? It's not that hard, they don't go too fast. I could probably run after mine on foot if I had to. Maybe with the newer automatic VW's you have to worry, but I don't worry about my old one. How hard is it to spot a 1970 VW camper w/ over 60 bumper stickers going 50mph down the highway? I'm confident that my VW loves me enough that it wouldn't even start for anyone but me anyways Peace-Alexis (vwgrrl)
