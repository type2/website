Subject: 6x15 wheels and *real* tires on '75 powerbus :)

William, Rennie, Tim, and other Porsche-flirters or owners of schizophrenic
busses,

I just trial-fitted a 6x15 Fuchs alloy with a 205/65/15 Continental Contact
CT22 (rated at 1700+ lbs.) and using a 1&quot; thick wheel adapter. Tonight I'll
weight the new wheel/tire/adapter combo and compare it to the original steel
wheel with reinforced Michelin XZX. I'm curious to see if there is any
difference in unsprung weight.

The combo fits, but rear fender clearance is *real* close as I  can slide a
piece of cardboard with little drag between the tire and the fender lip, I'd
say about 4 or 5mm.

I'm also concerned about offset: the Fuchs has a 36mm offset, but the 25mm
thick adapter reduces effective offset to 11mm. Remember that the stock
offset is 39mm.

Hence ideally, I'd like to do without adapters. A third reason why I'm not
thrilled about adapters is that the lug nuts sometime seem to come lose: I'd
torque all lug nuts (now 10 for each wheel!) at 13 N.m (94 ft.lbs.), but
seem to only need 11 Nm (80ft.lbs) to remove some of them a few days later,
whether I drove or not. I'm not sure why this is so.

I welcome comments :)

PS: You may wonder why I'm bothering to plus-size my wheels. Childishness
aside, I have decided that I no longer need the reduced roll friction of the
slim and outdated 185s, but would rather use the tires that VW decided to
use for their modern transporters. I'm hoping for better braking and better
handling for the flat-6 powered, 130hp bus.
