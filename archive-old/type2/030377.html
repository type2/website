&gt;Has anybody on the list ever had there vans professionally painted?  I was
&gt;just wondering what a 2 tone bus would cost around with some rust (no holes)
&gt;and no dents.. just getting an estimate...

I had mine painted white all over last year.  The paint job was around 
$1000 for 4 coats of epoxy-based paint if you don't count the fiberglass 
top.
