I think that this outfit has some serious issues with physics.  Their site
is long on hype and short on usable numbers, but their claim of being able
to fill a compressed air tank in 4 minutes from 220V current and then
drive their city car 2000 kilometers is stretching credibility a bit far.

Reminds me of the Moller SkyCar.  It's been Just Around The Corner since
the early '80s!
