&gt; Once upon a time my local VW dealer gave away badges
&gt; for every 50,000 kilometers traveled and bumped out of state repairs to the
&gt; front of the
&gt; list to keep you on the road...

Once upon a time, indeed. Why did VW allow their dealership network go to seed
the way they did? Doesn't add up. Kind of a one-two punch along with their
introduction of the Dasher... (anybody out there seen a Dasher on the road
lately..?)
