Subject: Split-guy sneaking some questions....

Hey guys,

I'm a split-bus driver, but have been &quot;lurking&quot; on this list for a while.

I was wondering what the opinions were of the bay-window automatic 
transmissions. Was it different from year to year? How does it hold 
up. Any particular goods or bads about it. Any reason...other than 
preference...that you would drive with a manual tranny instead of 
automatic?

What are the different bay-window trannies? Which years are 
innerchangable? What is the best year(s) for the bay trans? I'm 
assumming the later ones are the best....

On the front suspension....is there a difference from year to 
year...other than the drums-to-disc-to-bigger disc brakes thing?

These questions might be kind of strange sounding I know. Hope some 
of you can shed some light on my &quot;ignorance&quot; of the later model 
busses. TIA.
