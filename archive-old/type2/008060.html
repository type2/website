Hey Now All --
My dear friend, who also has a bus but doesn't have a computer with which
to access all of your wisdoms, would like to dabble in painting her vehicle
-- a 77 loaf named Miss Zora.  She doesn't know where to begin as far paint
types are concerned.  Can anyone recommend what kind(s) of paint are best
for painting the body of a bus?  If it helps, we live in the
liquid-sunshine zone of Portland OR and busses don't stay dry for very
long.  Thanks for your help!

Travis
