Subject: Re: [T2] Belly pans?

     I have a 69 deluxe sunroof bus that has the cancer-ridden remnants of a
belly pan flapping in the breeze in the middle/rear of the undercarraige.
When I think about the possibility of replacing it I think more along the
lines of fabricating a stiff nylon sheet rather than welding in a doomed to
rust-in-no-time metal pan.
     I've also considered making an air dam out of similar material to rig
up under the front bumper.  The thought being that it might improve handling
and gas mileage for long hauls out on the highway.  I'm concerned though
that such a radical change in the airflow characteristics might effect the
cooling of the engine.  Anyone care to share their thoughts?  How about you
wind tunnel engineers out there?
