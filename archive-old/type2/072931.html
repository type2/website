A few weeks ago I brought the AIRS (Aircooled Interstate Rescue Squad) idea
up for discussion.  After a few days of recieving loads of supportative and
some non-supportative e mail the general consensus was that it was a go and
that &quot;it was an idea that had come of age&quot;.

Ken Hooper has already agreed to let us house the site as a link to the
Type 2 webpage.  I will be the czar of the site as I have already said, but
I simply do not know html at this point.  I will however check all the data
to make sure it is correct and complete.

This is what we need to make it happen:

-A webpage with a form to fill in similar to the buy and sell form, accept
where you put your vehicle info you would put pertinent rescue member info.

-Someone who knows HTML that can build this site with some amount of speed
and quality.

-This person also needs to be creative with it as well.  Don't make it so
big and complicated that a person with a Mac Classic or 286 PC with four
megs can't access it, but hey add some color and splash if ya wanna.

Please help if ya can.  The map thing can wait for now but we need
something to start up with and build from.

I am trying to find a program for my Macintosh that will allow me to learn
to build sites on my own but that will take time.  Any suggestions would be
great.

Please help if you can!

Thanks,
Charlie Ford
