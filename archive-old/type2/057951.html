Subject: Re: Heater cables

I spent quite a bit of time and $$ making sure I had decent heater boxes on
my '71.
This involved going to a VW junkyard (who had hundreds of the damn things
lying around rusting) and comparing my originals with their 'good 2nd hand'
ones. Some things I learnt (which are getting foggier now)

- Bug boxes and type3's are different (shorter, I think) I hope you haven't
got them by mistake.

- Good German boxes are about 4 times as heavy, get them if you can.

- place hand firmly over one end and blow hard in the other, most leak
cause they are rusted through in a place you can't see (this earns you
instant respect from the salesmen, when you get a black ring around your
mouth, and throw that one back)

- flappers are usually broken, make sure yours work.

- the top of a bus box (with flapper part) can be cut and welded (brazed?)
on to a type3? box in good condition if you can't find a good complete bus one

- lots of High Temp sealant (and knuckle skin) will be required, especially
where Ken's beloved ring clamps are supposed to go but were replaced with
bits of tin and wire because the heater and muffler usually come from
different countries and don't see eye to eye.

So I had all these problems and more, finally using one of mine with fixed
flapper and another which was cut and joined, connecting those cables was
NO fun on gravel either.
Are you really sure you want heaters? I'm afraid to use mine in case they
break.
