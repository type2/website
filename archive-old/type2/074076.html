Subject: Re: [T2] Locate the PO of '80 Vanagon ; Hyattsville MD

Don't know...

I quoted the Hollywood Video information because there was NO indication 
that the bus was from the local (Baltimore MD) area.  And the date of June 
2001 on the receipt pretty much assures that the VW was runing then, just 5 
months ago.

Now here's the rest of the story:  The Camper 'had' a Michelin XZX 185R14 
tire on it that was abslutely the freshest and newest I've seen in -6- years 
of hunting. It appears to even have the white glue from the tire sticker on 
the thread!!

OK, so what??  OK, so where did the PO get this Michelin XZX tire.  Was it a 
recent purchase, or did they have this XZX as a spare for the last 10 years 
(XZX were not available in USA for the past 10 years.  There is some rumor 
that they were being produced in CANADA)

I would LOVE to get -3- more matching Michelin XZX.

&gt;Sounds like a sad story. Did they get into an accident on their way home?

&gt;&gt;Sorry for the BW:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am trying to locate the previous owner of a baby blue '80 Vanagon
&gt;&gt;camper.  Last know whereabouts' was at a Hollywood Video store in
&gt;&gt;Hyattsville MD on June 6, 2001 at about 7:45 PM, where they rented the
&gt;&gt;Tom Hanks Video CAST AWAY.  (OK, OK, so I found the receipt in the '80
&gt;&gt;at a salvage yard last weekend ! ! !)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;There was a LiMBO sticker on a rear window, and it seemed like a very
&gt;&gt;nice camper when it was complete.  Baby blue; white camper top.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Please info me off list.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;TIA
