Subject: TypeIV parts for sale

I've got a small storage area filled with a few years of collecting bus
parts, mostly typeIV / baywindow stuff.  Some of the highlights (from
memory) are a typeIV case all sparkling clean, gas-adjust shocks, headlight
upgrades, coule fridge/camping units, a few alternators, lots of tin (at
least one complete set), a running 1800 engine, two or three set of the orig
dual solex carbs, some heat exchangers, child cot, some padding to restuff
two front bech seats, and several boxes of misc stuff.  

The engine came from a bus I bought, and was running fine when I pulled it. 
I bought the bus for the body, and already had a nice engine I had done a
topend rebuild on.  I swapped them, and put the other engine in my basement
with the plans of doing a full rebuild.  I never got around to the rebuild:)

This is all in the Portland, Oregon area, and shipping is not really an
option.  The last time I sold some stuff like this, folks offered some
trades.  To stem that one, the only things I would be interested in trading
for would be a 
        - white water raft (frame, oar rig, ....)
        - white water kayak (a newer playboat design)

If anyone is interested, shoot me an email.  I'm thinking $500 for the
whole shebang.  If you want to stop by and take a look, let me know.  Its
always nice to meet bus owners.
