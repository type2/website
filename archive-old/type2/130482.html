&lt;&lt; Why is clearcoated paint supposed to be so much better? &gt;&gt;

Who says it is...?

My guess is clearcoating is a process used by the auto makers to
limit the amount of &quot;color&quot; paint they have to buy and use to ob-
tain a satisfactory finish...

Clearcoat always looks like a polyurethane finish on furniture...It's
nice but when you've seen a professional french polished piece, it's
just saran wrap in comparison... ;-P
