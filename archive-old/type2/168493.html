Subject: Starting problems with 78 2L FI

Hi all,

I have a 78 with a 2.0L FI engine with Pertronix ignition. This has about
10k on it since a rebuild by Boston Bob. Normally, she runs beautifully. I
put her into storage last year, and it was running fine. When I went to take
her out, she wouldn't fire. I pulled the air cleaner and made sure the AFM
flap was free and was activating the fuel pump. I used starting fluid, and I
got no response, except for twice when she backfired and blew the AFM off. I
looked for any egregious vac leaks, but couldn't find anything. My plan is
to  go and change the plugs and possibly the coil. I may also try to static
time it. All vac lines are hooked up, and all electrical appears to be in
place and working.

Thoughts on what simple thing this might be, or where to start? I know the
AFM is something I swapped out a few years ago, and I think I remember
pulling off the cover and bending the armature to avoid the inconsistencies
of the groove.

Thanks in advance.

Ned
