Subject: RE: [T2] wanted: watercooled replacement engine for 1973 Bus

Jenny, I have heard of people using a Subaru boxer engine, Kennedy
Engineering probably has the adapters for that. I wonder, too, if a
Rabbit diesel could be made to work. As the others have said, it's not
that easy and takes time and money to implement. Probably not going to
do much for the resale value either. On a side note: a friend of mine
has his heart set on putting a diesel engine in his VW Thing. Also
interesting, Bay window buses powered by diesel engines were available
to the European market, but were never imported to the States. Good luck
in your search for a better way, Timo
