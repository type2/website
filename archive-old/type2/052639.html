Subject: [T2] feelings, nuthin' but...

Gentlepersons-
                      At some point, probably this one, one/I realize that I 
will never get to
another project. Hence, I'm putting out feelers to see if anyone in my area 
(northern
NJ) might be interested in a '72 Bug...Drove in here a while back and needs 
work, etc.
My 79 Bus is and will continue to be my daily driver so trades applicable to 
the '79 are
of the first order. Anybody local interested in the Bug, contact me.
