Subject: [T2] dual solex carb and choke questions

Hey all!
I'm working on setting up my just rebuilt carbs (72 Westy) and have a
question about my choke electrical connections that maybe someone can help
with...

On the right side, both brass (or copper rivets) make contact with the spade
connector that is on the outside of the choke housing, whilst on the other
side only one rivet connects?
Have all the right books, (Bentley, Clymer's, etc) but can't find a decent
pic of both the left and right choke units?
Is this the norm?  It looks stock to me.  28 years old, but stock.

Also, what should I do next, after it's back in the Westy?  As in both carbs
completely clean, rebuilt, but I am sure they are way out of synch and
adjustment.  And how do you go about adjusting the choke?  I rotated the
units to where they were just making contact with the butterfly actuator
part before locking them down.  Is that all the adjustment there is?
BTW: One is right on the &quot;Mark&quot; and the other is past it a little.


Thanks!
