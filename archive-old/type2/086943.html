Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump Relay Testing

&gt; Hey Chuck,
&gt; 
&gt; I just performed the air vane test with the ignition on and the fuel pump 
&gt; did not run. So there is the problem. I also disconnected the fuel injector 
&gt; signals just for fun and as expected the van only ran a couple of seconds 
&gt; and died. Therefore we ca conclude that injectors are not the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Now to test it further I traced the two fuel pump wires to a relay in the 
&gt; back of the engine compartment. I found the fuel pump signal and connected a 
&gt; solid 12 V from the battery. The pump worked. So it's not the pump that's 
&gt; dead. I have disconnected the relay. It's the one that has two 6 pin sockets 
&gt; connected to it. Now I need to find out what are the terminal connections 
&gt; and test it. Do you have any clue of what they would be? I have not been 
&gt; able to find it in my Haynes manual.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody know this info?

not sure about the Haynes but in the last section of the Bentley it is
section 4 biginning on pg 7 last chapter (Fuel Injection)
