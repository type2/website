Subject: Re: [T2] brake booster

When I replaced my m/c, it was braking fine, I knew that it was going to die
eventually, I am pretty  sure it was the original, 30 year old m/c.  My
booster was full of water/brake fluid?  I cleaned it with rubbing alcohol.
When I put the new m/c on, I discovered the booster was then shot.  I sent
it to H&amp;R.  Now everything is fine.  I wonder if I will discover fluid in my
booster in a few years.  My m/c came from Brazil.

The only way that I can see that the brake fluid can get into the booster
would be from a m/c leak.  There is no other possibility.

I am also certain that, since the booster is connected the intake manifold,
one can get gasoline/air/exhaust fumes/??? in there as well.  The H&amp;R guy
says that often gasoline kill boosters.

I cannot help but think that there is a slow fluid leak from the m/c in this
case.  Not enough to affect braking, but enough to accumulate in the booster
with time.

&gt; Subject: [T2] brake booster
&gt; 
&gt; question is:
&gt; 
&gt; What would make a power brake system fill the booster with fluid, and pull the
&gt; pedal to the floor on it's own?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This bus has a history ... the first time this happened the [say original, who
&gt; knows] booster and master cylinder were replaced with a rebuilt one... worked
&gt; for about 2 years , it repeated itself.
&gt; 
&gt; Booster fills with fluid [I thought it was brake fluid, in fact I am sure it
&gt; is
&gt; brake fluid] 
&gt; Brake pedal pulls itself to the floor when the engine is running
&gt; 
&gt; That rebuilt booster and master was replaced with a &quot;fresh off a scrapped bus
&gt; with working brakes&quot; known good used master and booster,,  this situation
&gt; worked
&gt; for about a year
&gt; 
&gt; Now, 1 year later , that used booster is full of fluid , and sucks the pedal
&gt; to
&gt; the floor.
&gt; 
&gt; Each time, the &quot;customer&quot; complains that he never had to ever add fluid to the
&gt; reservoir, even though about 2 liters spill out of the booster
&gt; 
&gt; Vac check valve seems to work when tested
&gt; The inside of the rebuilt booster was full of rust,,, leading me to believe
&gt; the
&gt; fluid was actually water... or mostly water,,
&gt; could the vent be sucking in water?
&gt; 
&gt; so:
&gt; ??? All of them have deteriorated so they leak enough fluid past the master
&gt; into
&gt; the booster?
&gt; 
&gt; Could this fluid come from somewhere else?
&gt; 
&gt; What do you think causes this???
