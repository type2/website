Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Tank



&gt;But that slight bit of extra pipe was to block the crud that settles out of 
&gt;the gas and the water too.
&gt;

Which is why I use a fuel filter. This xtra bit of crud that you mention is 
often from the water making rust! I would rather my filter deal with the 
small stuff and thats all there will be.
