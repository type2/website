where can you get an inexpensive sniffer???

Bob
&gt; Volks,
&gt; I had a stumble at all RPMs in my 78 FI 2.0L all stock. Put it on  a
&gt; smog sniffer and found the CO at 3.5 (at idle). Adjusted to 1.7. Per
&gt; Bentley I am near spot on at 1.7. Runs better now.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have experience with this adjustment? Any thoughts, other than
&gt; Bentley,  on where this adjustment should be?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Chris
