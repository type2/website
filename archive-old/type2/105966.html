Subject: That part I need...Please try again Karl

I am assuming this is for the 76 Kombi, and not the 75 bug?

If yes, on the L Jetronic system, there is no such thing. Sounds like you have
a bad fuel pressure regulator.
It controls the return to the tanks. If the diapraghm ruptures, raw fuel will
be sucked into the engine. Here
is your FI fuel rail:

#3 is the pressure regulator.

Hi Karl,

The webpage is completely unreadable. It comes out in dots. Can you tell me
how to find it on the website?

The fuel regulator works because it still has succion, or that's how the
mechanic tested it. It still creates succion, therefore, he says, it's this
other part...the pressure regulator?
