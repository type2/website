Subject: sliding door step attachs how?

Hi!  I just acquired a side step for under the sliding door.  I have a 78
westy.  Yesterday we tried it and it slid into the jack tubes just fine.
However,  I don't see any fasteners or holes for any or???     Anyone out
there have one?  If so how do they stay on the bus?

Second question... This is a 78 westy with a propane tank.  In the archives it
says something about a cut out to permit the propane valves to operate?
Anyone have knowledge about that?

Thanks!  My wife loved it as her birthday present!  Harry if you read the
list, thanks again!
