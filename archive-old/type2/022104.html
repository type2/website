Everybody has their favorite books. I am curious about everyone's favorites
and would like to add a few to my library if they pertain to my intrests. I
am curious mostly about 'How to' books and ones that explain subjects like
fuel injection or engine blueprinting. 

Please reply to me directly with the title, author and what makes this book
(or these books) your favorites.

I'll compile a list and post them. 

Thank you.
