&gt; Hmm, this is interesting.  Mine don't wobble when on the road, maybe because
&gt; I haven't abused them enough yet.  Perhaps I'll be repairing them in a few
&gt; years, but I just can't deal with a bunch of overheated little kids in the
&gt; back of my bus.  Even with this new information, I'm sure I'd never be able
&gt; to prevail upon my wife to leave them closed in the summer.  The great
&gt; airflow is one of its best features.  And the ability to repair stuff is one
&gt; of mine.

Russell:
Two or three alternatives here:
Late bay (78-79) side windows. They slide like a splittie front, so the maximum
open area is &lt;50%, but they don't stick out or get MUCH worse from age.
You can get screens for them from a same year Westy. On my old 78 I did notice
an unpleasant buffetting sensation at speeds over 65 or so, but this might not
be a problem on the 69!
Air conditioning. I put dealer installed air on the 78 and was quite pleased
with it.
someone on eB*y had several type 2 NOS units last year, seems like the name was
Kerr Auto. Be careful when purchasing one of these, most are not compatible with
a pop-top. I've converted both my 87 Vanagons to R134a and am quite pleased,
though the bay units are quite a bit different. Modern rotary compressors would
help with a type 1 engine because they take a lot less horsepower.
Air conditioning DOES change the nature of the experience in subtle ways. A
little more detachment from reality.
I bought my 58 sunroof  deLuxe from a guy who'd taken his large family on
vacation in it several times. He took them to Rocky Mountain National Park with
the sunroof open. THAT'S imersion in reality, especially with 36 hp and
mountains. Too bad for the folks behind them, but if you want to drive fast,
take the freeway! I guess it depends on your own personal situation.
