Subject: GERMAN made Bosch W8CC spark plugs!

Just a quick note that I found a small N.O.S. stash of GERMAN made Bosch
W8CC spark plugs (for 72-up Busses and aircooled Vanagons). These are
unusual because Bosch has been making them in India for some time now. Many
feel that the original German ones were superior.  (I have no way to
personally verify this claim.)

They are $9.95 per set of 4 (which works out to $2.49 per plug).  I have
around 20 sets of four, and of course when they're gone that's it. I figured
I'd give List Members first crack at these, so I haven't listed them on the
web catalog yet under Bus parts. However you can find them at this link:

http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=W8CC-4

I'll do my best to pull them quickly once they're all spoken for. (If I
fail, and you missed them, I'll email you to let you know.)  If you go to
the link and it no longer specifically says GERMAN in the description, then
you're definitely too late and the ones listed are Indian again.

This may be stating the obvious, but if you need other tune up parts, oil
filters, etc., it's worth adding them to the same order, as the first pound
costs the most to ship and additional pounds much less.
