Well adjusted the valves again, a little loose.   fired right up on the f=
irst turn. But, still seemed sluggish.  =20

did balance test...................died when pulled 3 or 4 wire, but ran =
the same when one or two was removed.  =20

So I put a plug on the end of the 0ne and two wire and ran started the ca=
r to test for spark.  Yup.  Spark was present.  Hooked the wires back up,=
 and sprayed brake clean around the bottom of the intake manifold on 1 &amp; =
2 ...no change in idle.  =20

I am at a loss here..........I was anal in my assembly of this motor.  =20
