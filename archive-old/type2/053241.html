I would agree that there shouldn't be sharp high spots on the shaft.  If it
is galled, the raised metal can be filed down, then the whole end of the
shaft smoothed with emery cloth.  There will be low spots, pits, but these
will fill with grease and will not bother the needle bearings.  Reasons:
This bearing sees speeds of only a couple thousand rpm intermittently when
you use the clutch.  There is practically no load on it, which is why many
people are driving around with 40-year-old pilot bearings that have seen
hundreds of thousands of miles.  The only stress on the bearing would come
&gt;from unbalance or run-out of the clutch disc, which is negligible.  Its only
purpose is to hold the input shaft centered and stable, which is why it's
called a pilot bearing.  The fit of the gland nut over the shaft is loose,
maybe .004 of an inch. Pits in the shaft are not going to matter in such a
low-stress situation.  The only offence is against aesthetics.

Anyway, I've had to &quot;clean it up and run it&quot; in two or three cases over the
years where money and time were bigger considerations than aesthetics.  Maybe
one of them was one of my cars.  I never saw one fail.  Anyone have a
different experience?  (One of these days I have to get into the Archives.)
The guiding principle here would be that the shaft has to be round and
smooth, not snaggy.
