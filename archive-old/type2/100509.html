Subject: Re: [T2] [t2] What will be the power difference from a 1.6
  upright to a 2.0 Panc

Can I go 70-75 easy.
&gt;Nope. 60-65 is a leisurely highway bus speed with that engine IMHO.
&gt;
&gt;RPM             2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 5500
&gt;27 : 24 (0.889)   36   45   54   63   72   81   90   99
&gt;

Ever with a 79 tranny? I thought they had taller gears for this very reason. 
My friends 73 tranny was swapped to a 79 and it seemed to me 70 mph had the 
same engine sound as 60 previously. Am I incorrect?
