Subject: Help with a picture of the bit below the air cleaner

Hi,

I am desperate to get a part  of my engine just right (1974 1800 carb engine).

My van went into a garage and they fixed a flap that allows hot air
into the bit under the air cleaner by putting a screw to stop the flap
from closing. I'm not too familiar with this but I believe it should
be done by a vacuum to open the flap to control the air? Can anyone
help with a description and a photo of the bit with everything intact.
I don't like misplaced screws etc as there must have been a reason for
not having the flap always open.....

yours

Charles
