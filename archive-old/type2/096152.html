&gt; Hi List,
&gt; 	What are your torque wrench recommendations (type, brand, model#)  
&gt; for the low torque fasteners on the type IV, i.e.&lt;25 ftlbs.  All of mine
&gt; are right at the botom end of their range and I think it is time to get
&gt; another tool. Thanks. jon

I have a Pittsburgh wrench from Harbor Freight, clicker type, 10-150ft
lbs, $19.99 part #  00239-1AVH
   wouldn't use this if I were running an auto shop as it does not appear
very durable but in the limited use I give it and always keep it in a
plastic case and treat it carefully it has served me well for a couple
years, it might be off by a lb or two but it seems to be reasonably
accurate by my checking....YMMV
