&gt; Does it matter what order you adjust the valves in, on both solid and
&gt; hydraulic?  Someone said something to me about turning the pulley
&gt; counterclockwise whilst doing the adjustments - necessary?  What happens
&gt; if you move it the other way?

Well you don't adjust the valves in a hydraulic system except for that
initial adjustment.  It doesn't matter which way you rotate the engine in
either case.  The only reason to turn it counterclockwise is because it
makes it easier.  The normal firing order is 1-4-3-2 with the engine
rotating clockwise.  When you rotate the engine counterclockwise, it
becomes 1-2-3-4 which makes it easier for adjustment since you can do all
the valves on one side before having to go to the other side.

&gt; 
&gt; AND - just replaced my lifters ('79) - when bled (yes, apparently you
&gt; must disassemble the new lifters and reassemble them submerged or...???)
&gt; should you be unable to depress them manually?  This is the case with
&gt; mine.  Only 2 of the old lifters have any appreciable movement...
&gt; 

Follow the instructions in Bentley for assembling.  You want to assemble
them while submerged in oil so they will not have air in them.  They
should not have any appreciable movement when they are pumped up (that is,
full of oil).  If you can push on them and get movement then that lifter
has bled down, meaning there is air in it.

Typically lifters that have bled down will pump up with oil again after
the engine has been running a while, but until they do that's what that
loud ticking noise is.
