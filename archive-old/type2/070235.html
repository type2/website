Hello everyone,
        I'll soon be pulling the engine (as soon as I am done
rebuilding my spare heads) and want to add some lights in the engine
compartment.  I read Bob H's sermon on lights back there, and I want
to give something like that a go.  I've drawn up a rough diagram
below, and would like some help with the question marked spots.

I want to run a 10gage wire from the battery to a switch to turn
things on and off.  From this switch to a fuse box.  And hang four
12vdc lights off the box as well as a cigarette lighter.  Bob said to
use a 25amp fuse for the lighter socket, what about for the lights?
And what gage wire from the fuse box to the lights and socket?

And last but not least, is a fuse box like this easily available?  If
not can I just fan out 5 wires from the ON/OFF SWITCH to the 4 lights
and socket with a fuse between the switch and each item?
