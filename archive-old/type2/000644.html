X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Recently I decided to rob the peggy bank and get new seat covers and carpet
for my Loaf.  In view of recent articles about the quality of TMI products I
decided to go through a local Portland, Oregon vendor to purchase these
items.

After waiting over a perido of time for these items to arrive directly from
the factory, they finally came.  Before I go into detail of my sadness, I
wonder if any of you out there have had difficulties with TMI and there
products.

To me it seams simple for this major company to make a center floor mat were
the passenger seats are without having a big cross stitch showing were two
pieces were put together, or having missed the complete right edge or corner
where the sliding door closes, or ask this old man for my home made carpet
set so that they can make a patten of a 79 bus!!! I hate to tell you all how
the front carpet piece looks like, because without question some body forgot
were to sew and were to cut.  As for the seat covers, they forgot to put in
the original seam metal and put in string to hold the bottom of the seat
cover to the seat frame.

I shall not go on, as I do not want to have the volins start playing, or
tears flow down your screens on to the keyboards of your computers, but I am
very interested to know how many of you have or have not received a product
like this from TMI.
