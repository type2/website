Subject: 1600 Engine Rebuild Question
Message-ID: &lt;374c57001600 Engine Rebuild Question*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

&gt;I'm at the point of putting my 1600 Type 1 engine back together.  
 &gt;The case has been align-bored .020&quot; over, the crank is
 &gt;ground .020&quot; under.

&gt;The problem is when I get it together the crank is binding.  I can't turn it 
over using the flywheel. 

It sounds like a problem similar to the one I had recently - I measured the 
ID of my main bearing
bores and found myself at the wear limit on two of the four bores. I decided 
to have the bores 
oversized rather than take a chance on a spun bearing, so I sent my case to 
RIMCO, who do great
work. They oversized my bores, ran the align bore through there, and sent it 
back. Meanwhile, I had
my crank replaced locally and bought my main bearings the same place I got my 
crank. The same 
binding occurred with me. I figured it out, it was that I was at the wear 
limit for the standard size bearing,
which RIMCO understood and took me to a .010 bigger. But I relayed the info 
to the crank guy inproperly
and he gave me .020 mains. So you see my main bearings were too big and It 
was pretty ugly, I damaged
the bearings trying to install it and had to drop another 50 on a new set. 
Once I got everything right, 
it went together like butter. Double check all your figures and make sure you 
have compatability. 
However, it was pretty obvious to me that I screwed up, while in your case it 
sounds more subtle, like the 
case fits together no problem but there's an imperceptable bind. That seems 
more like a slightly off align bore
or a crank that is catching. good luck
