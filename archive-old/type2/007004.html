Folks,

This Sunday, 1-4PM. Accomodations still
available for long distance travelers.

Highlights of the developing menu include:
Chili, Pasta Salad, Beef a la Bourguignonne (!),
&quot;Splittie Cookies&quot; (!!) and who knows what else.
There might be drinkables as well ;-).

Michele would like to get a better head count,
so if you think you'll be there, and haven't
already, drop me a note at tforhan_at_pipeline_dot_com

If you got directions from Skip's Type2 Web page,
Hypermail dropped a crucial first line. Get the complete
story at:

(Geeze, it may have been shorter to repost the directions!)

See you then,

Tom F.
