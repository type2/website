Follow up to my knocking noise.

I drove it home after work and noticed the sound only happened while going 
over bumps.  luckily!! :)  So at least it is not engine related.  I took it 
home and crawled underneath and grabbed everything I could get my hand on 
and moved it and pushed it.  NOTHING moved.  nothing seemed loose.  while 
driving it seemed as I could hear it more while in the car then while 
sticking my head out the window.  but man, its a loud noise.  not something 
you have to try to listen to in order to hear it.

So I guess....CV Boots, Bad Shock(does anyone know what kind of symptom that 
would produce?), or engine mounts are loose but I dont think its that.

I drove the beetle today so I don't have to worry about it :)  Its always 
nice to have multiple VW's.  thanks for everyones replies.

Pat Callaghan, seems like the compression test can wait a little bit.  So 
maybe not this weekend.  I'll call you when we &quot;try&quot; it to see if you have 
time to assist.
