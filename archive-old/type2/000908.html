Subject: More brake booster stuff

My recently acquired '69  has no disc brakes and no brake booster. I'd
driven a similar bus in the seventies but did not remember that it takes so
much force to stop the bus. The brakes do work quite good it's just that it
is a &quot;real men's&quot; bus.

Apparently it is possible to transplant a later axle beam with disc brakes
and booster onto this bus. That however compromises the originality of the
bus so I do not think I ought to do that. Just adding a brake booster might
be an acceptable modification.

My technical know how is insufficient to judge whether this is feasible or
not. So that's my question ....
