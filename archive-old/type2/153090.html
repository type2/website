Subject: Re: [T2] Stranded ... Bus won't run.

&gt; I do not have a 2.0 liter, just a 1600dp

what's a dp?

&gt; but jerking like that usually
&gt; indicates lack of fuel getting to the engine. You said the pump was
&gt; putting gas out so that is a good thing. Is the 2.0-liter carbed or fuel
&gt; injected?

It has a single carb that is supposed to be fairly new. I turned over
the engine and a little gas dribbled out of the hose ... should it be
a LOT of gas ... like a squirt ... or just a dribble?

thanks for the idea to check the hoses, that sounds like a good idea
and I'll try that tomorrow.  I'll also check the valve gaps, but the
mechanic I took it to last glued one of the valve cover gaskets on, so
that will be challenging to pull off.

Thanks for the tips.  I'm still looking for some way of knowing if a
valve is fried, or what a burned valve does to change how the engine
runs.

For now I'm trying not to stress out.  Peace to you and yours Max.
