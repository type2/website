Subject: RE: [T2] Rubber steps for 70 front bumper

&gt; New rubber step pads are in order.  The old ones probably
&gt; have weathered to a hardness something on the order of diamonds.
&gt; Got the new bumper pads from West Coast Metric and they fit like
&gt; a glove.  Go new (yeah, they're a bit spendy) and you won't regret it.


We have them for a bit less, of course.  Still not cheap, but at least a bit
cheaper. $62.75/pair with listmember discount; part # 211 898 291.
