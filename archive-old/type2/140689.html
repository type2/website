Subject: Re: [T2] bus accident

I had an accident a while back and needed a 'nose job'  The insurance guys 
used the word 'write off' and I immediatly found a bunch of buses for sale 
online in comparable condition and faxed them those web pages. I told them 
that in my opinion my 78 is worth at least 10 K Cdn .. anyway they sent out 
an adjuster and they agreed to fix it.  So ... I shopped around for a body 
shop and found two highly recommended shops.  I took my bus to both (and 
another) and at one of the shops the guy said: &quot;the last time we did one of 
these we had problems getting the fans to work&quot; - whoa - that was just the 
place for me ... so I took my bus there.  The only complaint I have is that 
the nose they used was from Brazil - it has a little bump kinda thing where 
the emblem goes - but that's not my complaint - my complaint is that they 
didn't use a NOS nose - I should have shopped around myself first and found 
my own NOS nose (they are hard to find but they are around) - then just had 
them put it on - I don't really care about the little bump where the emblem 
goes - I care more about the quality and gauge of the metal.

They painted just the nose that they replaced and you cannot tell from the 
original colour - you can see though that it is a base coat/clear coat.  I 
had another shop respray my rockers and they painted the passenger side up 
to the belt-line - I'm pretty disappointed in the colour of that - that 
second shop currently has my 60 - but he is a resto guy so .... if he gets 
the mango green as close to the interior mango green as he got the rockers 
to the colour above the belt line then I'll be happy - but I wouldn't get 
him match paint like the first shop did.
