Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuilt engine in or around Raleigh, NC?

Transporterwerks is a good shop - I know the owner, and they can rebuild
yours. That's the only shop around here I'd trust. How bad is yours? What
year? It was pretty easy to get parts when I built my last engine here.
Otherwise, you'll have to mailorder one, unless T-Hoff still sells
longblocks...they are convenient, but pricey. I only use them when I need
a part today, otherwise I'll order online.

&gt; Does anyone have a suggestion for a rebuilt longblock or turnkey engine
&gt; in or around raleigh, nc?  The one I currently have is in pretty bad
&gt; shape.
