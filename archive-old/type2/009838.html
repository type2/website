Isaiah,
    Last fall I bought a 71 Westy that had a leak where the fill reservoir, 
behind the drivers seat, joins the hose that goes down to the master 
cylinder.  I was able to get the new seal that goes between the hose and 
reservoir from my local VW dealer at a cost of about $2.  I believe you can 
get it from most of the usual vendors like RMMW, Bus Depot, and others.
    Only thing is, that was not the only place it was leaking.  Turns out 
that the fill reservoir had a couple of cracks in it, emanating from the 
mounting tang.  I could not find one, new or used, anywhere and had to fix 
my reservoir.  First I flushed out he reservoir with plenty of water and 
then let it dry over-night.  Next, using a low wattage soldering iron with a 
pointy tip I melted the plastic over the cracks.  I used a swirling motion, 
kind of like welding with a tourch, to move molten plastic over and into the 
cracked areas.  To reinforce the side of the reservoir with the cracks, I 
brushed on a moderately thick coat of 20 minute epoxy, and into the epoxy I 
worked a piece of fiberglass window screen that was the same size as the 
reservoir side.
    When you assemble the reservoir to the hose, with the seal in between, 
use a small clamp at the joint.  Also, make sure your seat doesn't hit the 
reservoir when you push it back.  Its been about 8 months since I repaired 
ours and it's still holding + dry.
