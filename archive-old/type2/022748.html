Subject: re: what is an idler arm

X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

the idler arm is part of your steering linkage.  it is located underneath the passenger side of the bus &amp; is connected to the other parts of the steering mechanism. basically, it is a swivel-type of arm that will be mounted to the chassis.  it is very common for an idler arm to become worn due to age.  i would not be surprised if it needed replacement.

i do not know how much this part costs, but it should take an experienced mechanic 1 hour maximum to replace. of course, backyard mechanics may require a little more time as well as a 6 pack of cold beverages.  be aware that you might need an alignment after the new part is installed.

most importantly - i must agree w/ Mr. Lyle's earlier reply to your brake question - find a bus-LOVING mechanic before doing anything.
