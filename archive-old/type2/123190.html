not to be a spoil sport, and Yes I have owned several buses and other VW's
including the 78 bus that I have driven as my daily driver for the past 12
years.

&gt; so i am looking for a safe car i can maintain myself for my family that is 

well can you maintain other things? are you mechanically inclined?? or do
you have trouble putting in a light bulb. a bus will not automatically
make you a mechanic.  it takes some work and it is better to go in with
some knowledge and apptitude

&gt; also fun. i think a bus fits well with what i am looking for.  i am making a 
&gt; few basic assumptions about buses from what little knowledge i have.  maybe 
&gt; you all could correct me if i am mistaken?  i understand it is fairly easy 
&gt; to remove the engine and that aircooled engines from volkswagen are fairly 

define &quot;simple&quot;  the later typeIV engine is fairly heavy, which is what
you will need if you want to cruise at 70mph (and that is pushing the
average bus engine)

&gt; simple to fix/wrench on/maintain.  i also understand that it recieves fairly 
&gt; good gas mileage and if cared for is very dependable.  please tell me if i 

buses average 16-19 mpgallon

&gt; looking to pay?  i have made a list of what i want in this bus and i 
&gt; understand that some of it will have to aftermarket labor and parts.  here 
&gt; is my list.  if you could direct me as to what parts/kits i might need, 
&gt; books to read, classes to take etc, i would greatly appreciate it.

for books start with the Bentley manual

&gt; 
&gt; -i need a dependable daily driver capable of sustained 70mph speeds - i 
&gt; understand there are dual carb options and special transmisions...where, 
&gt; how, what?

as soon as you differ from stock you change the reliablity, and only the
later fuel injected buses will cruise comfortably at 65mph (some perfect
buses downhill with a tailwind will do better)

&gt; -i need heat and possibly a/c. - are there kits for this?

yes but,  the only auxilary heat worth beans is the gas fired and it
requires you to put it in unless you are very lucky.
a/c takes power and reduces miles per gallon. 

&gt; -i understand that sway bars are a good idea - anything particular i am 
&gt; looking for in a good sway bar?

the opinions vary, I don't have em on my bus and consider the handling
adequate
&gt; 
&gt; -if the mpg is less than 25mpg what can i do to improve this?

not a whole lot, and what you can do is $$$$
&gt; 
&gt; -about how much time a month am i looking at to keep it in daily driver and 
&gt; highway speed shape?

depends on where you have to start from....  after you get it back to
reasonably close to stock shape, figure about 2hrs a week in routine
maintenence plus whatever is needed for major rehabbing 

&gt; will i need any specialized tools?

some
&gt; 
&gt; -how safe is a bus in accident situation? rollover?

depends on what you hit or hits you...probably not as safe as a modern
auto with all sorts of modern features.  buses don't have air bags or real
meaningfull crumple zones nor antilock brakes etc.  on the otherhand they
aren't made of tin either

&gt; -relatively how expensive is it to purchase parts for a bus '68 or up?   
&gt; thanks for your help!!!

what parts do you need, some are realtively inexpensive, headlight bulbs
are a fraction of new cars for example.  some other parts are the infamous
NLA (no longer avaliable, at any price)

remember also that if the bus breaks you are the mechanic, even in your
best clothes in the rain on the side of the interstate.  converrsely it is
nice to know that if it breaks you can fix it on the side of the road in
the rain.

there are many answers to your question, and only you can answer them,
one thing that has been said is that count on spending approx $5,000 to
put a decent bus on the road, either spend $5k for one that is in good
shape or spend $1k on a ratty one and put $4k into repairs to get it back
in fair shape.

some things that are reccomended to be done when a bus is
purchased. include all new fuel lines, new brakes, oil change and filters
(type IV engine)etc.

good luck
Bob
