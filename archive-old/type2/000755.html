Thanks for the response and the near FART that developed from the earlier
posting.

BUT - since I posted this I have not only adjusted the rear brakes but
replaced them entirely. They were way past due when I got down to it. I
adjusted the brakes and now the E-brake works. But here's the kicker. The
pedal still goes down more than I believe it should and I can still pump it
to the point where I think it should be when I first step on the brakes.
They've been bled too. Something just doesn't seem right. When I put my foot
on the brake and start the engine the brake pedal will suddenly move further
which I think is indicating correctly that the vacuum assist unit is
working. Anyway - any ideas?

Another thing - and very important for those considering that brake work is
for someone else more experienced. And to do it the &quot;right way&quot; it needs to
be taken to a shop. This is your life were talking about!!! When you step on
the brakes and they don't feel right they NEED to be fixed.

By default I'm a very trusting individual. Two years ago I had a local chain
do my brakes. Partly because I just didn't feel I wanted to(lazy) and partly
because I thought they must know more about it than I do. Well the guy who
put the brakes in told me that the rear drums needed to be replaced because
they had been turned out quite a ways already. So I bought new drums and a
couple of weeks later I went to put them on... The IDIOT had adjusted one
star all the way in and the other all the way out on both sides. At least he
was consistent... Then he tightened up the E-Brake cable to make up the
difference. This was a professional? I didn't need new drums, but should of
had my head examined for having them do the work in the first place. The
&quot;right way&quot; is to do it yourself. When you put your foot on the brake -
isn't it nice knowing that the brakework was done by someone who REALLY
cared! IMHO-FWIW

TIA for the response to my problem.
