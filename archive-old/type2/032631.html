Subject: Re: Torsion Bar Installation Success

I used a big plastic cable tie first to get the leaves together firmly, then 
wrapped ordinary string around several times and tied it tightly, then cut 
the too-big cable tie off.  I had already beveled the edges w/ a dremmel 
tool. 
Bingo! the bottom one went right in w/ no pounding, the top took a rubber 
hammer the whole way.  then they weren't tight on the other end when they 
came out and I had to do the string trick to get that torsion arm on.
now all four arms are on and we'll be on the road in a couple days.....
