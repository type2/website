Subject: Re: [T2] '70 sink faucet

Chris,

I am going to quickly break down the sink and drain function and what it 
consists of from the 68-73 buses, because you have probably never seen it in 
action:

Assuming everything is working properly, the white filler cap you have 
already found is where you add the water. The sink pump is a pump, much like 
the old well pumps or one like you would find at a group campground. You 
just move it up and down and the vacum action pulls the water from the tank 
and once it's going you can leave it going. Now you have &quot;grey&quot; water. This 
(at least on my '72) pvc pipe ran down the back of the fridge cabinet and 
out of a hole through the floor of the bus, and on over to the passenger 
side where it ended with a cap on it. When the cap is removed the air from 
the vent (you are missing) would help to let the water flow out, rather than 
stand (you may have one of these air vents on the side of your house too, 
for the kitchen sink).

If you pump the pump and you don't hear a sucking noise you have a problem 
with the pump or make sure that the small black plastic tube from the pump 
to the bottom of the tank is intact and doesn't have a hole, etc. (think of 
a drinking straw with a hole in it).

I have all of these parts if you need something. Everything from the pump to 
the drain and cap and the air vent tube and seal, etc. PS the air vent will 
work with your top.

Good luck,

Rob Henley
