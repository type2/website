Subject: spare tire well water/rust


Folks,

After looking at some of the pictures of the buss that Johan Svanborg
was trying to decide to buy/keep, I have a question...

Where does the water come from that gets into the spare tire wheel well???

I have recently expierienced this in my 78 and could tell that water in 
my wheel well was a fairly new phenomenon.  I could not figure out where 
it was coming from though!

Any hints on this one?

Cheers ,dave
