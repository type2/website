  advice

A friend just had this exact problem. He found a lawyer down there who
negotiated it down to equipment malfunction for around $200. He was so happy
he sent the lawyer an extra $100. He was doing close to 100.

&gt; I'd be pretty reluctant to make any admissions in the land of mandatory
&gt; minimum sentences .. sure it might be refreshing for a judge to hear:
&gt; &quot;yeah,
&gt; I did it, I'm sorry, and I won't do it again&quot; but if there is a mandatory
&gt; minimum sentence .. no matter how refreshed the judge may be he may lack
&gt; the
&gt; discretion to do what he thinks is right ...
&gt;
&gt; I think I would 1) get the best lawyer I could afford .. or 2) I'd look
&gt; around for one of those organizations that strictly defends driving and
&gt; ticket offences - in Ontario we have Points .. but there are these guys:
