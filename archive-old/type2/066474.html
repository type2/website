Until last summer, I had a key that opened the driver's door, passenger 
door and that back hatch.  The sliding door lock I guess just goes 
earlier, but I'm not sure since I had to rip off the door and grease it 
all up just to get it functioning...  I'd recommend getting seats at a 
junkyard (it depends were you are in the country if anything is 
available) and having them recovered- I had all my seats recovered and 
the inside panels and everything, fabric and labor was about $400 so 
that's not too bad.  Get a locksmith to do a mold.  If you're a AAA 
member, its free and that's how I got a couple keys made on dumb 
forgetful occasions...
