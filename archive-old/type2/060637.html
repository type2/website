Subject: Right Hand drive Crew Cab Parts

Hello all,

Well as some of you already know I recently picked up a new project--grin
grin--A Right hand drive 68 crewcab!!!
Well, when I say project I mean it, this thing needs everything.
Unfortunately It also needs one its most important parts that is specific to
RHD's, it needs the 3rd door assembly for the left side, some one has
removed this one:(
Any help locating these parts would be GREATLY appreciated. I will call all
supply houses, wrecking yards or who ever that people can think of that
might have these parts.
Thanks again for all the help that everyone and the list in general has
offered.
Shawn
Tacoma, WA
2 68 crews ---1 left 1 right
71 single
72 kombi
92 &amp; 94 H*nd*s
--Side note-- I noticed there is a 71 crewcab for sale up by lake Stevens,
looks solid except for rockers, the guy is only asking $2000.00 if
interested I will get you the specifics.
