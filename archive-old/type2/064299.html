Subject: oil light; cutting out; canvas

Hi all -
I've been reading the posts about the oil light weirdness and have a
possibly similar problem... when warm, the idiot light on my 70 will start
to flicker, esp at idle. This flickering is in EXACT synchro with engine
rpms. Once in a great while, the engine will stall from idle after this has
been happening, and will crank but not start.It will go after a bit.  The
engine has good compression, runs well, fresh oil; just has this one
glitch. Is my oil pump worn? It is NOT the sender, as I have tried 3 or 4.
It *could* be an intermittent short aggravated by engine vibration; I'm
checking this.

SECOND: while driving the other day, the bus just STOPPED dead at an
intersection, no warning, no grumblings. Idiot lights came on, turn signal
still worked. Just no va. I had been smelling something hot for about a
mile - not oil. Engine would not crank, but that's my damn starter (have
the WR-1 on the way!). Let it sit while I checked it out... olla kalla.
Cool, full, gassed and sparked. ????  Tried it some time later; started it,
and drove to local guru's house. HE smelled &quot;electricity&quot; but didn't have
time to track it down (I also owe him $$$ already, so...) Any places I
might start looking for what seems to be a short, frying part, or melting
wire? I have some gauges, but they have been there for 4 years w/ no
problems; my guru suspected them, but we couldn't make the engine quit when
we wiggled their leads. Louis has built vw's for 30 years, so when he says
it would take a few days to track it down, I get nervous.
THIRD: to those looking for canvas for singlecabs, I have been too busy to
contact all my leads; I apologize for the delay. (Had a friend up from New
Zealand for four days... I think my hangover will last about that long.)
Will post asap.
