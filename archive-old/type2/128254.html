Subject: Re: [T2] Brake booster failure? (Yes, another person with this

&gt; Ok, once I got my idle dialed in, I found that pressing on the brake

Then your booster diaphram is torn and the booster needs rebuilding. The
test procedure is at:
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/brakes/vacboo.htm
or search the type2 archives for &quot;brake booster rebuild&quot; for a longer
explanation but if applying the brakes kills the engine, then you have a
big leak and it's 99% sure to be in the booster.  From the archives, if
the booster is bad, see:

&quot; A while back someone recommended H&amp;R Booster (actually it's H&amp;R
Automotive Parts) in Dallas to rebuild brake boosters.  I sent one to Ron
over night, he sent it out today.  Total cost including COD and overnight?
$105. H&amp;R: 972-286-5516&quot;

&gt; But the brake booster did provide good assistance in stopping. So is
&gt; it a hose? The booster? The valve (that I can't find)? Where exactly
&gt; *is* the one way valve? Don't tell me it's up by the fuel tank
&gt; please... ;-)

In the line from the balance tube to the booster.  As I remember on Dual
carb endines it is closer to the firewall but after 30+ years, it could be
anywhere or nowhere.  It is *not* in the gas tank compartment, but mey be
on top of the trans.  Run your hand along the vacuum line for the booster,
it's there somewhere!

OOK!
