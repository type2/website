Subject: Cyl. Head Temp Gauge Sender?

Just put a '81 Type IV engine back together, new heads, seals, etc.
It's running fine, everything seems okay, but the cyl.head temp gauge is
obviously screwed up. I noticed the problem actually just before I
pulled the engine -- it was blowing a major amount of oil, everything,
including the whole inside of the engine compartment, was covered with a
coat of oil. It was blowing 2 quarts in 10 miles. 
   Anyway, what I noticed was the gauge started wavering, even going
backwards considerably. No way could the actual temp have been
flucuating that much. When I put it back in, I cleaned the oil off
everything as much as possible, of course. The fabric cover of the temp
sender was pretty soaked tho, and also looking rather frayed in
sections. So now in the renewed engine, it's doing the same thing. I
noticed another anomaly, in that as soon as I turn off the key, the temp
gauge drops from the 400 it was showing to about 200 -- normally the
temp guage shows the same temp key on or off. And it goes right back up
if I turn the key on. 
   So I guess I could get a new sender -- probably should, but I'm a
little puzzled too -- like why is it changing with the key on &amp; off?? 
Anyone else experienced this sort of thing?
