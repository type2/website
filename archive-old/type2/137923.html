Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarket A/C for Type 2 Camper

I wouldn't run A/C in a bus unless it has a type 4 motor, 72 and up.
Why not buy one that is already equipped with AC and save yourself the
installation troubles?

 We're down in Charleston, SC, and have recently purchased a 1969
 hard-top camper in NC. We're picking the bus up next week, and since
 we're in the dead of winter, the fact that it doesn't have an A/C unit
 is not yet an issue.
 
 However, come April, A/C will be a must-have item, even for short
 trips. I detest the hot summers down here (I'm more of a West Coast
 guy), and A/C is something we're very serious about acquiring.
