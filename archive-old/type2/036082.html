&gt; Boot ?   My bus doesn't have a boot !   
&gt; Vans in general don't have boots !   (Not even front engined ones !)
&gt; 
&gt; But there *is* such a thing as a van with a boot !   (Made by VW of course.)

I have made a boot (trunk to us colonials) in my last two vans... very
convienent to keep tools and things out of sight, the current one locks
too.

wrote up how I did it some months ago, should be in the library

&gt; How cool is that !?   A van - with a boot !
