Subject: Re: [T2] Custom Bed &amp; Re-doing interior (71 Westy)

The previous owner of my bus already did that. With
the way he did things, you still have the spare tire
area to store things. It is a foam padded piece of
plywood with legs to bring it up, even with the
existing cushion. I'm gonna be a sophomore in
college this year. I always wanted to live out of my
bus instead of in the dorms. Just don't park at the
dorms, especially on weekends. Get a parking pass, so
you'll have places to park. Man, these obnoxious
bastards would harrass you to no end, if they found
out you were living in the parking lot outside their
dorm. If your school has a fitness center like mine
does, you could use the showers there. Luckily,
because I'm playing drums in the pep band, I get free
housing. I kind of want to live out of my bus and
write a book about it, like traveling across the
country. Kind of like cross between Jack Karoac's &quot;On
the Road&quot; and Tom Wolfe's &quot;Electric Koolaid Acid
Test.&quot; The problem is trying not to go crazy while I'm
alone all those months. I thought about bringing my
dog. I don't know, I'm still in the planning stages...
Oh, yeah. A couple Christmas' ago, my dad got me this
really nice sleeping bag. It always stays fluffy. They
covered one up with a piece of plywood in the desert
and parked an army tank on it for 6 months and it was
still fluffy as ever. Expensive, but worth it. If
you're wet, you're warm. If the bag's wet, you're
warm. Even if it's not arctic outside, like unzip it a
little and you'll be comfortable. I keep one under my
Z-bed incase I break down like at Glacier National
Park, or something crazy like that....

I get rather annoyed by
&gt; that spare tire hole back there, since mine is
&gt; mounted on the front and I don't need one in the
&gt; back.  I wanted to know if anybody made and seat
&gt; cover setup that went over and covered that thing. 
&gt; Also I want to re-do my interior.  The walls/roof
&gt; covering is really bad and I was wondering if
&gt; anybody had any recommendations on how to replace
&gt; it.
