&gt; About border crossings, of which there are many stories and few
&gt; hard facts, I have a few questions: What about insurance? (My company
&gt; wont cover me more than 100 miles into Mexico) Do the border guards
&gt; check registration, or can I take a friends car? Am I being
&gt; overly anal about this stuff?

You have to buy Mexican insurance at the border. It isn't very expensive. 
Bear in mind that it's intended to cover damage you might do to the 
property of Mexican nationals, not especially to cover any damage you 
might have done to you. The latter is far more likely--Mexican drivers 
and Mexican livestock are incorrigible--but not their problem. In the 
case of your Bus, that doesn't matter too much, I guess. ;)

The registration doesn't matter, but you have to have the title in your 
possession when you come over. It is *possible* to talk your way 
past not having title in hand, I have done it once, but it took hours of 
convincing a mustachioed bureacrat in Cuidad Juarez. Just bring the 
title, it's far easier.

You can get a tourist visa for the asking, but it takes time and standing 
in line, and things go much faster if you have a passport. In general 
they are much happier if you have paperwork in hand they know to be 
&quot;official&quot;, this lubricates things very much.

Beyond the border, you'll go through another checkpoint around 50 miles 
south of your entry point. This is actually a DEA gauntlet, although it's 
ostensibly run by Mexico. You may or not be hassled by the swarthy white 
men from Texas there.

Beyond that, nobody really cares a jot in my experience. They want to be 
sure you won't sell your car there, and they want to be sure you aren't 
hauling any drugs, but Mexico is only too, too happy to have you come and 
throw money around and they have no wish to piss you off.

Tell your wife you'll probably have to come back early because you'll 
miss her so much. ;)
