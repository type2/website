Subject: circuit breaker

I want to replace the non functioning circuit breaker on the electrical =
outlet in my 73 Westfalia. The electrical connection is functional, =
works when plugged in, but the button for the circuit breaker is =
obviously not working.
Are there any sources for a replacement?
Oh, and does anyone have the 2 button Westy lamp fixture they would like =
to sell?
