Subject: Re: [T2] what i will admit to today

Hi Stevo,

It was my engine that broke in Nevada, and it was the rocker shaft stud on 
the #3 cylinder.  I think it was just a bad stud, as there was nothing else 
wrong with the engine.  Anyway, it's good to check that stuff out before 
something goes badly wrong, especially if it could leave you stranded in the 
middle of nowhere.

Good luck!
