Subject: Re: [T2] Electric Fuel Pump Relay

you're not mixed up, Jamie, but I was until you straightened me out. You're
right about the battery drain, of course. I'll use your suggestion to
connect the hot side to the alternator blue wire. Thanks for the help.

Subject: Re: [T2] Electric Fuel Pump Relay


&gt; Ah, Maybe I am mixed up,, but if you use the stock oil pressure switch,,
it only
&gt; makes the circuit to ground when there is no OIL pressure,, you would have
to
&gt; use a normally closed contact on the relay so that when there is NO oil
pressure
&gt; it is open, and the fuel pump is off,,,
&gt;
&gt; and when there is oil pressure, the power circuit to the relay coil is
open, and
&gt; the normally closed contacts close,, making the circuit to the fuel pump
&gt;
&gt; This logic leaves the relay coil energized all the time that there is no
oil
&gt; pressure,, or all the time your engine isn't running, I see a dead battery
in
&gt; about 2 days time....
&gt; that is if you used a &quot;hot&quot; lead from the battery,, now if you used the
hot lead
&gt; that is from the ignition switch then you will not leave the coil
energized,,
&gt; but the ignition switch now has to carry the current of the fuel pump
&gt;
&gt; I assume there are 2 pole oil pressure senders,, and one is N.O. and one
is N.C.
&gt; contacts,, this way you could use the n.c. contacts for the oil light and
the
&gt; n.o. for the fuel pump... works great for the carb engine, cause there is
enough
&gt; fuel in the bowl to get the engine running to increase the oil pressure,
to
&gt; close the switch to make the fuel pump operate,,
&gt;
&gt; I think the easiest way to connect an electric pump, using a relay, is to
&gt; connect the &quot;hot&quot; lead to the relay coil to the blue wire from the
alternator..
&gt; as soon as the alternator starts to spin it will power the fuel pump
relay, and
&gt; the fuel pump
&gt; install a fused hot lead from the battery to the fuel pump ,, chassis
ground the
&gt; other side of the relay coil and the fuel pump and your in bidness
&gt; This works just like the factory installation of the aux heat fan in the
engine
&gt; bay of a 73-74

&gt; &gt; Thinking that it would be a good idea for the fuel pump to shut off when
the
&gt; &gt; engine stops, especially in the event of an accident, I have been
following
&gt; &gt; the thread and considering how to do this on my bus. (74 T2/T4 Carb) Has
&gt; &gt; anyone tried running a hot lead to the relay coil, then grounding the
other
&gt; &gt; side through the oil sending switch? Seems to me that would do the job,
but
&gt; &gt; I could be wrong. Wouldn't be the first time. (Maybe the third time)
