Subject: Re: [T2] Wheel cover

&gt;&gt;I found a molded steering wheel cover for $10 to fit our busses at a truck
&gt;&gt;stop in CO. 18&quot; (they have 20&quot; ones too that were only $8) and fits the 78
&gt;&gt;perfectly!

&gt;
&gt;What is it made of???
&gt;

	Genuine artificial simulated imitation plastic leather-grain effect
	- waddya expect for $10?
