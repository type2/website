Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Overheating / to those who
  use Gene Berg dipstick ...

Boiling water (212 degrees) will not trigger a properly calibrated GB
227 oil temp dipstick.

I am a little scared of trying to get oil at 227 degrees on the gas
stove in the kitchen. (smell, fire, wife ...)

What I did was stick the turkey thermometer in the dipstick hole when
GB 227 was turning light on.

Cheers - Arnaud


&gt; I have the same problem with my stock 1600dp.  Last weekend I drove &amp;
&gt; the temp stayed around 220-230, but in the summer it goes close to 240.
&gt;     I was going to test the dip stick in boiling water, just to see if
&gt; the gauge is accurate.  I'll have to do that soon...Happy Busing.
