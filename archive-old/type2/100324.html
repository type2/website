Subject: 76 bus in Vermont, Jeff Tinker

  If Jeff Tinker is reading this post, please contact me as I have lost your 
E-mail.  I have secured the 76 and it has a title. Unfortunately the P.O. 
has not located her keys, but the steering does not lock, and the auto 
shifter, will go in to neutral. Please contact me.
