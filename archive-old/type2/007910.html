Subject: VW-TWO NOTCHES ON CRANKSHAFT PULLEY
Date: Mon, 30 Nov 98 12:31:40 PST
From: Nick Pace &lt;nickpace_at_rand_dot_org&gt;

Please help me settle an argument I am having with a friend.  He has a
super-clean '67 convertible Bug with a crankshaft pulley that has only two
notches that are very close together.  He has been using the left-most
notch as his dynamic timing point for his .009 dizzy since he thinks the
notch is TDC (and that is what he thinks a .009 should be set to).  I told
him that the timing mark is OK but for the wrong reason and that his is
probably setting his valves incorrectly.  It is my belief that pulleys
with two nearby notches do not have a TDC mark; rather, the left notch is
7 1/2 degrees BTDC and the right one is 10 degrees BTDC.  When he uses a
timing light to set the timing, use of the left notch is OK since .009
mechanical advance dizzys usually are set to 5 to 7/12 degrees BTDC at
idle.  The problem is that TDC for setting valves (and for finding 180
degrees to complete the valve setting) is actually about an inch to the
left of the 7 1/2 degree mark.  My '71 Bus has a pully with three notches
and I assume that the left one is TDC and the two close together ones to
the right are 7 1/2 and 10 like his (the distance between the right notches
are the same as the distance between his two notches).

My friend, of course, disagrees.  He says he's been setting valves to the
left notch for years and the Bug runs fine.  He thinks the right side notch
is to mark a few degrees of advance for some unknown purpose.

Can you help?  I've seen pulleys with one notch (TDC) and three (like mine)
but this two notch pulley set-up is weird.

Thanks,

Nick
