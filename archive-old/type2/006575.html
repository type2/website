Subject: Re: [T2] What's this hole- part 2

This is the oil pressure relief valve location on a 914.
Remove the plug with an allen wrench, and you will find
a spring and piston. If you have a 914 engine case,
there will be a vertical dipstick at the breather box,
the casting for the bus oil filler tube will be casted
but not opened, as well as the location for a mechanical
fuel pump ( carb engine ). The engine number will be either
by the breather box or on the case seam front.
Lets start with your engine case #- What is it ?

Subject: [T2] What's this hole- part 2

&gt;I didn't get the correct answer to my original post, but I've got additional
&gt;information.  The &quot;hole&quot; in my crankcase at #1 cylinder between the pushrod
&gt;tube holes is pluged from the inside with a thin aluminum hollow plug.  I
&gt;looked at other type 4 cases at a local repair shop and it appears that
&gt;there's supposed to be a 12 point plug there.  It's shown on page 5-55 of
&gt;Bentley but no reference number is given, nor is there an explanation of its
&gt;function.  Does anyone know what this is?
