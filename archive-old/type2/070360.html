Subject: Corvair power

Anyone out there have any knowledge of/ experience with the 
Corvair-to-breadloaf conversion? I'm considering it for my 70 Westy (there's 
a Corvair parts place that still sells the kits). Specifically:
1) Can I hook up the heater
2) How does the beast shift?
3) General comments on the reliability/longevity of the Corvair engine

I hope feedback is good, cause I'm pretty psyched about this. From what I 
call tell, the Corvair engine is all the Volkswagen bus engine should have 
been: powerful, hydraulic lifters, oil filter, dual carbs, etc.
