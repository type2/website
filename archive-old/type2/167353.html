&gt; ....and I hear the leak
&gt; when compresion testing... 
&gt;

hmm,,, like pfft,,, rrruh rrruh rrruh  pfft  rrruh rrruh rrruh  pfft 

like the head isn't seating against the barrel.. 

I just came across a set of new heads.... the barrel was actually seating 
for the first few thousand kilometers on the shoulder of the barrel instead 
of the rim.
The head recess was something like 7mm deep,, the barrel ext from the 
shoulder to the rim is only 5mm ,,, so,, I ended up having a machinist plane 
2mm off the top of the first fin on the head. 

The casting of the head seemed to have a little tooo much alum in the mold,, 
and it was high in the center,,which held the barrel from seating 
properly.... 

when I did the compression testing.. it sounded like rrruh rrruh rrruh  
pfftrrruh rrruh rrruh  pfft 

I didn't even have the rockers on the engine when I did a leak down, putting 
air into the cylinder proved the leak was between the barrel and the head... 

hope that isn't your problem
