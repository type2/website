&gt;
&gt; &gt; Here's a question that will brand me a newbie fer sure! My clutch
&gt; &gt; &quot;comes in&quot; right at the floorboard. 77' bus 70-something T-4.
&gt; &gt; The cable seems to be at the end of it's adjustment. The main symptom
&gt; &gt; is that it's difficult to get it into gear and there is a thump when
&gt; &gt; you put it in reverse. The upshot is I need a &quot;quick fix&quot; to get
&gt; &gt; me through emissions here in Phoenix. Once I get my tags I can pull
&gt; &gt; the motor and put a new clutch in.
&gt;
&gt; Put a new clutch cable in. On a Bus it's easy. (At least there's enough
room
&gt; to work under there...)

And if you still can't get enough adjustment to get the release point
halfway up:  add more washers to the end of the bowden tube!
