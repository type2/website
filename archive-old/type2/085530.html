Subject: Re: [T2] towing question

Ian Janes sends:

&gt; What are they talking about &quot;drive line&quot;?? I had no probs getting my buddies
&gt; bus back from KS to VA on a tow dolly.

They went under the Bus to look for the driveshaft running between the
engine in the front of the vehicle and the differential in the back. After
finding the skinny little driveshaft running between the teeny-tiny front
mounted engine and that big-ass differential in the back (the one with the
huge thing hanging off the back that they didn't know what it was), and
determining that it wouldn't just swing down and out of the way when they
pulled the pin out of the universal joint, it was decided that unhooking the
driveline on a VW Bus was just too hard.
