Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Pump for a 78

I have a friend in the auto parts business and I asked him to check on 
this.  He found another manufacturer (besides Bosch - he didn't have the 
Bosch info handy) of the pump used in the Fords and there are two different 
part numbers for the pumps used in 75-79 transporters and 85-88 Ford trucks:

75-79 TypeII is Roller Vane, 30GPH open, 110psi shutoff.
85-88 Ford truck is Roller Vane, 40GPH open, 95psi shutoff.

Not sure what this means to us, but it seems likely that the Bosch pumps 
might be slightly different as well, although they may work just fine 
anyway.  I will try to find out more.

&gt;On those fuel injected f*rd vehicles in question there are two fuel pumps,
&gt;one in tank, and one frame mounted. The in tank pump is a low pressure &quot;lift
&gt;pump&quot; to supply fuel to the frame mounted high pressure fuel injection pump.
&gt;The frame mounted pump is the one you want.  It varies in location on the
&gt;particular model you scrounge off of.  But fuel injected rangers and f150's
&gt;from 85 to 88 have these pumps.  Other models and years may have them but
&gt;you have to verify that yourself. When I went to get mine from the scrap
&gt;yard it was already pulled and sitting on the sales rack.
