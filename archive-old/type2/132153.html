Subject: Re: [T2] Odd (?) valve clearances

on 6/2/04 11:32, Jack Ganssle related:

&gt; My '77 bus has the valves set per the procedures. But while turning the
&gt; engine over by hand I noticed that at other points in the cycle the gap
&gt; increases - by a lot (like to .050). Is this normal?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Jack

jack,

this is a solid lifter engine, yes?

it depends pn a few things, mostly what kind of cam you have in the engine.
yes, it can be considered normal.

this is why i never adjust valves by looking at the distributor. i adjust
them by looking at the position of the valves themselves. when the #3
exhaust valve is completely open (all the way IN), the valve opposite - #1
exhaust - is fully closed, and ready to adjust. you can do this for all the
valves. when #3 intake is fully open, #1 intake is ready to adjust, and so
forth. i make paint marks on the fan pulley for the adjusting points. you
will end up with 4 marks in total (not 8), as the adjusting points for
opposite sides of the engine will line up, but be 360 degrees apart. you'll
have a mark for #1 &amp; #3 exhaust and so forth in similar corresponding pairs.

if you re-adjust the valves with the above technique and you still have the
gap moving around on you, there might be a problem somewhere in the valve
train.
