&gt;installing a new alternator on my engine. my current alternator is f-ed
&gt;and i have a new one, i'm just having trouble removiong the old one.
&gt;thanks,

It's doable.  I've done it.  Took me all day.  I'm not a seasoned veteran, 
but I can fix almost anything that goes wrong.

My recommendation:  remove the engine first.  It might take you all day 
still, but its a good chance to introduce yourself to your engine -- look 
things over, retorque the heads, etc.
