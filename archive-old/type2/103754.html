Subject: Re: [T2] WEBER CARB

I have a '72 with a single weber carb....it's starts right away and 
runs great at all RPMs (although it requires a warmup in cold 
weather).

I think my distributor is just a 009 mech. advance unit because there 
are no places to hook a vacuum hose to it.  The vacuum port on the 
carb is also plugged.  I don't know the official &quot;best&quot; setup or what 
the PO did, but my setup sure works great.

If you look closely at the photo below, the carb has a rubber hose 
with a bolt plugging the vacuum line.

I previously had a different 72 bus with dual carbs and they were 
nothing but trouble$.

&gt;I have a 72 van , 1800 engine that I just bought.
&gt;My other 72 van , 1700 engine got siezed.
&gt;The thing is: this van i just bought has a single weber carb.
&gt;I have an advance distrubutor and the vacuum lines are blocked off
&gt;and are not connected to the carb?does anyone out there have one of these
&gt;single
&gt;weber carbs? if so whats the deal with the vacuum lines?aren't they supposed
&gt;to
&gt;attach to the carb?
&gt;Please tell me anything you might know about this mystery.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks alot,
&gt;Darren
