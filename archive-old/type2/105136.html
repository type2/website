Subject: RE: Remove my head

Yes, I have heard from the list.  It is better/easier/surer to drop the 
engine .

But how about simply JUST removing the heads, as in, from a donor that is 
going to the crusher in a week...

As on a '72-73 (I am specifically asking about a '73 that has a single carb 
setup, with those long intake (spider legs) manifolds (non-stock) and some 
A$$ carb in the center.


If I am only trying to save and recycle the heads, and not the engine tin, 
nor planning to replace the heads in the same vehicle, would it be a 
different story??

Removing the engine is NOT an option.  Should I just pass on this '73??

Thanks

Barry fumes
