Subject: Bus parts (was 70 Westy parts)
Date: Sun, 14 Feb 1999 09:37:56 PST
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain


I have gotten a few requests for parts from this Westy. Almost all have 
been for regular bus parts. 
If anyone needs any 68 and up parts, let me know. I can find just about 
anything. Usually within a short period of time. [71 front upper breast 
tin takes a little longer]

Someone was asking about their roof paneling being painted white on a 70 
Westy? This 70 Westy has bare wood paneling.

Someone else was looking for lower tin on a 79 Cal bus and was told that 
72-74 was the same? Yes, the right piece is 72-74. The left is 79 Cal 
ONLY. 
I have a pair of 72-74, 75-78, 79 Cal.
