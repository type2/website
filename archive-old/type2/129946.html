Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump Relay ..

You said you were going to rebuild the stock mechanical pump. I can only 
suggest that is what you should do if you can find a rebuild kit. Check 
with BusDepot. If they don't have a kit, I did get a NEW mechanical pump 
from them.

The time/money you spend on the temporary elec. pump is just wasted. To 
engineer that so it runs only when the motor is turning is a bit of 
engineering that will cost far more than a new mechanical fix.

&gt;I had hoped to increase the safety of the system but having the fuel 
&gt;shutoff on stall or accident.
&gt;Having read the type 2 archive there was an article which used an FI relay 
&gt;to shutoff the fuel pump on stall.
