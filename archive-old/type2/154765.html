Subject: Re: [T2] Great North American Extreme Bus Race

But if 
&gt; we could find the right sponsorship to make it worthwhile, VWOA, BusDepot, 
&gt; BustedBus (no, you guys aren't off the hook, either), German Supply, Koni, KYB, 
&gt; etc. etc., we might could find $20,000 or so to make it worth it. 

If you could get AAA to sponser and the entry fee guaranteed a tow home from anywhere along the route to anywhere you lived you could probably attract a lot more people.
