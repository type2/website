Subject: Re: [T2] so, if I am testing for shorts, what am I doing wrong?

Okay - maybe I've got my electricity all screwed up but if the load is 
going through the bulb - in series with the bulb - a large current flow 
will result in a bright light, low current flow, dim light. Do not run it 
parallel with the load.

Just like a dimmer switch on a light in a house.

I've not tested this, but I have fried - that is FRIED - a $20 multimeter 
by sending too much current through it on a low current test mode. Was a 
non-fused meter.

Well actually once I was done with it - it was quite fused - and melted.

Correct me if I'm wrong, I need to learn all I can.




&gt;  --Does that make sense Chris?
&gt;
&gt;Won't the bulb in series just draw whatever it requires to light itself 
&gt;(load) no matter what the short is doing? It's a simple circuit. 
&gt;(12vdc+/short/bulb/12vdc-)
&gt;

&gt; &gt;I would suggest using a dome light bulb in series with the battery &gt;to 
&gt; see if it is a large load (bright light) b/c most of the $20 &gt;multimeters 
&gt; would let the smoke out if subjected to a 5 AMP load in &gt;the current 
&gt; meter setting.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;If the bulb is bright, big load, if the bulb doesn't light or is &gt;very 
&gt; dim you might be okay testing it with the meter.
