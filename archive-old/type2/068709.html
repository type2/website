Subject: RE: heater blower

Emily, you can probably replace the blower with non-VW part, but only in
the sense that it's a Volvo or Porsche or Audi part.  The motor is
built with the squirrelcage fan right on it, and lots of European firms
use the same module.  I've gotten used to paying $10-20 for them at flea
markets.  Be sure to test with 12v before you buy.  Sticky-blows-fuses is
only one of the failure modes.  The other is turns-quietly-on-great-bearings-
open-circuit-stone-dead.  They are cheap enough that no one I've found
fixes them.
