Subject: Adjusting 32-36 DFAV Weber: Third screw?

Greetings, all!

I am attempting to tune in a 32-36 DFAV Weber, center-mounted on a 2l in a
1976 Westy converted to a hightop. There are three screws that can be
adjusted:
1) the idle adjustment screw, facing the back of the engine compartment;
2) the mixture screw, attached to the bottom of the carburetor, facing the
back of the engine compartment; and
3) a mystery (to me) screw, which is attached to an assembly that is
attached first to the to the post leading from the body of the carb to the
choke and then to the assembly that holds the accelerator cable, and which
faces the left side of the engine compartment (it's also almost directly
above the secondary vacuum port and the mixture adjustment screw). The end
of the screw goes against some sort of cam on the post attached to the
choke.

I understand how to adjust the first two screws.

I don't know what the third screw adjusts, or how to adjust it properly. I
have the book Weber Carburetors by Pat Braden, and I still can't figure out
what this screw is/does.

I am in the process of correcting a running-lean problem in the bus, which
process has been greatly facilitated by the jetting article on
aircooled_dot_net and excellent service from the same. I'm learning a lot, but
I don't want to mess with the screw until I know what it does, since in
things mechanical my intuitions tend to be wrong.

Thanks for any help,
