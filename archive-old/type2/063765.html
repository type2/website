Subject: 82 westie, ticking noise, need other trivial pieces.

Hi all, 
I have an 82 westie.  Most of my problems have been minor to date.
According to the PO, it had new engine put in at 55K miles.  Now it has
about 105K.  Last week I noticed a ticking noise develop in the 99+  heat
of August.  It sort of sounds like a sticky valve or something like that.

I changed the oil  this weekend thinking the heat was getting the best of
my oil causing a sticky valve.  . After changing the oil it still ticks after
warming up.  When I changed my oil, I had to remove tin to get the oil filter
off which the last oil change person cranked on really tight.  I noticed
minute amounts of oil exuding from the head/engine joint.  Maybe need a
new gasket?  

Any ideas on what I should do first.  At what mileage should the heads
be  re-done.  Could it be a piston disentegrating.  (I surfed into a fellow
volks VW homepage yesterady and he mentioned a ticking noise he had
for five years and then the piston fell apart  Dworkin's page maybe?.) 
Getting under it sure sounds like an internal noise.

Beyond that the bus is great.  I was also wondering how to tighten up
the wing window so it stays open at 55.  I took the door panel off and
found the clamp that holds the swivel but there is no waty to get a
screwdriver on it W/O taking it out. Do I need to dis assemble the
window molding to get at it?  Any ideas would be welcome.

Also on the side sliding windows,  where  might I find
the little plastic pieces that serve as the runners for the window.  Mine
are cracked and most are missing.  When the window is opened it grinds
on the aluminum frame.  

One last item, On the sliding door, Is there a replacement for the nylon
block on top of the door which keeps it in alignment.  Mine moves alot and
when a non VW person closes the door they tend to really slam it and it
misses the latch due this.  Any help on  the above would be appreciated.
 
Thanks in advance.
Ken Wyatt, 
82 westie
