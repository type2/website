This comes up every so often, so I took some side by side pictures of the 
rear seat/bed cushions, one has been washed, the other has not (but was a few 
minutes after the picture was taken). Even with my cheap digital camera, 
you'll see the difference is quite dramatic. Follow the link, on page one go 
to the bottom and click on the picture of my '77, &quot;Restoration Progress&quot; &lt;A
