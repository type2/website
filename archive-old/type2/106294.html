 I noticed that the
&gt; lenses appear to have a &quot;coating&quot; on the inside that appears to be a
series
&gt; of &quot;swirls&quot;, for lack of a better word, that make the lenses cloudy when
&gt; viewed from the outside, with the lights off. With the lights on, this
same
&gt; coating at first made the lights seem unfocused and diffused when viewed
from
&gt; any angle but straight on. From straight on, however, the lights are
&gt; EXTREMELY bright and crisply focused.


Just a guess here. This coating may be to reduce glare to oncoming traffic
since you say that straight on they are very clear and only blurry from a
side angle. ?
