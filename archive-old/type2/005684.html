Hello. (Type 2, 2 litre, 1979, twin carb, type 4 engine).  Well, having read
the answers to my previous questions, which I'm very grateful for, and
having read a lot in the archives and other resources / books etc. I've
decided that what I really could do with is finding a good VW garage /
mechanic. (My aim is to ensure that my fuel system - including tank, vents,
lines, filler hose, the whole blooming lot, basically, - is in good
condition).  I think maybe requests like this are a bit odd in this context
but I really do need to find someone.   Some of the people who have
contributed to the archive sounded absolutely ideal, but all the ones who
have really stood out have been in America.  I think part of that is they
have come across as being more prone to communicate as well as knowing their
stuff.  That is what I need.  Someone who is prepared to listen to me
spouting out the results of my researches and my concerns.  Someone who will
use their initiative to suggest from a position of great knowledge what
might be a good way to go about getting my van in the condition I'm looking
for.  Someone with a pleasant manner.  An honest person. Someone who likes
type 2s and knows them really well - in particular the catching fire aspect.
I've seen so many little obscure but brilliant bits of knowledge relating to
this subject recently.  There must surely be someone in my area who knows
this sort of stuff and can communicate - I've found that to be something of
an elusive combination so far - maybe it's me at fault!  I live in
Cambridge, in the United Kingdom so that's the general area I'd like to find
a garage/mechanic obviously.  I'll travel if I have to but I'm so cautious
about petrol smells now I am a bit reluctant to use the van more than I can
help until it has been thoroughly looked over.  Are you, or do you know of a
mechanic who comes close to the above description.  I'm willing and able to
pay for a good reliable job.  Thanks very much for any ideas.
