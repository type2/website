Subject: Hard starting?

Been seeing a few posts about folks and their hard starting busses.  Here is
what I did to alleviate my hard starting.  First thing was throw out the
&quot;hot start&quot; relay I had put in to try and fix the problem.  I then replaced
all the wire connections at the starter.  I cut the wires back about an inch
each to get rid of any corrosion at the end of the wire.  Installed brand
spanking new connectors on each wire, had to solder the big honking
connector from the battery wire.  Then I ran a big ground wire from the
engine case (you can get these at walmart, for riding lawnmower
applications)  to the body to ensure a very good ground connection between
the engine and the body.  This thing now starts EVERY time, no problem.  I
also ran a ground wire from my alternator case to ground for extra
insurance.  I have seen this on most of the cars I run across in junk yards
and figured to give it a try.  Not only do I get full charging from my
alternator now, the engine starts EVERY time.

Good *clean* connections with no wire corrosion, and ground connections, I
feel cured my bus.  This time.
