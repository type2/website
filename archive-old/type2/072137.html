Subject: ferry to Kodiak

Dear all,
   I know this sounds weird, but does anyone know how long a bus is ? I'll
have to make some reservations on the Alaska Marine Highway Ferry, and they
go by length. I can't just go out and measure because the bus, unlike me,
is already in the Yukon, frozen solid no doubt until April. While I'm
enjoying the spring sun in a Bavarian beergarden. Also, does anyone have
contacts on Kodiak Island ? There was a delightful woman on the list a
while back (Lotus, flower of the north...), but I fear she's no longer with
us. On the list, I mean, not in the more terminal sense.
  Any responses greatly appreciated.
Cheers,

           Gregor
