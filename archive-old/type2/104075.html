Subject: Re: [T2] heater and fresh air levers and dash?'s

&gt; which heater and fresh air levers is everyone talking about here.  i have a
&gt; 72 and am missing my blue rubber pieces on the right levers but have seen
&gt; the later model ones at the junk yard that are one big plastic piece.  if
&gt; that is the kind you need i saw a bunch on the vans at the wilmington, ca
&gt; ecology junk yard a couple of weeks ago.

the rubber is molded on the shafts. I think a lot of people pull them off
to remove the instrument panel instead of pulling the whole lever shaft
and all. problem is once removed they will never really get stuck on there
again.
