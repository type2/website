Subject: Re: [T2] Good karma, dead bus &lt;resolved&gt;

First, Thanks to everyone. I sure y'all can understand
what a bummer it is to sell a beloved, fine-running
V-UU to someone and have them break down.

Karma and bus are both intact.
After sitting all night, the bus started up as usual
in the morning, purring like a fat house cat.
Everything--timing, dwell, idle, choke--checked out
*superficially*. Plugs not fouled.

I told the owners it was one of three things:

1. some sort of intermittent electrical problem or
short, perhaps the platinum plugs.
2. The bus was broken-hearted for me and refused to
run for a new owner.
3. I took the buddha off the mirror.

I told him in any case, I'd tear up his check and
drive it home.

But the trucker and his 16-year-old drove it around
town for awhile. And, of course, were captivated.
Decided to take the leap.

So I gave them a fresh set of conventional bosch
plugs, a new set of bosch plug wires, a new rotor and
distributor cap. And, my Bentley, an old muir, and my
old compression tester.

I told the kid to get a new buddha *pronto* and never,
ever drive faster than 60 mph.

When I left everyone was smiling.

Thanks again.
