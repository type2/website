Subject: RE: [OVT] Horn Wire fixed

Hi Volks- Well, after 4+ hours of trying every sort of device from bent
needle nose pliers to hemostats ,etc., I figured out an easy way to
attach the wire. I drilled a 1/2 in. hole right above the spade
connector. I then took a piece of wire and fished the horn wire up thru
the hole. Grabbed the spade connector with the bent needle nose pliers
and , shoved the spade connector back thru the hole and on to the spade
terminal. Got the idea from the way VW used to cut holes in order to get
at the gas gauge sender without taking out the tank. Worked like a charm
in about 20 minutes. I have some other electrical work to do so I
haven't hooked the battery up to see if my horn works yet. Thanks for
all the replies and tips from everyone. This list is GREAT. TBear
