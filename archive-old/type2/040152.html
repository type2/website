Subject: Anybody want a bus?

I need to get rid of my bus soon.  Its an orange 73, doesn't run at the time, 
but could be used for some parts.  I live in central IL and need to get rid 
of it pretty quickly because I'm getting another bus, and don't have the room 
for 2.  You pay for towing and its you can have it.  I will be taking most of 
the interior out of it.  If anybody is interested please tell me soon.  I 
have pictures if you would like to see it. 

   Amy
