Subject: nuts on Kadrons

One of the most annoying things about the dual Kadrons that are on my 1776
is one of the two bolt/nut sets that hold the carb to its manifold.  The
inner one,  the one closer to the fan housing, has me stumpted.  The nut
sits at the carb; the bolt is inserted from below and has its head shaved
to clear the curving manifold.   I can find no way to tighten the nut.  A
socket fits over it but the ratchet extension cannot reach the socket
because the angle is too steep.  An open end or a box end wrench can fit
over the nut but there is zero room to turn such a wrench.

I bought a set of allen head bolts, hoping that I could insert these from
the top and get an allen head wrench in there to tighten.  I find that
there is not enough room to insert from the top because of a lip that
overhangs.

Perhaps the bolt/nut combination that I inherited with the carbs is not
stock.  Can anyone suggest a way out of this mess?

Jack
