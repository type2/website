Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Yikes - Paint is Expensive

Then there were the guys at BBBX that had their buses painted with &quot;bed
liner&quot; coating.  Looked great from 30 feet away, but up close it had an
interesting texture to it.  Color was somewhat brighter than even the
brighter bus colors.  Definitely covered up minor imperfections in
the surface!
