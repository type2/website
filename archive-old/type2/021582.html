Subject: Battery under the rear seat

Hey Everyone,
I wanted to get some input on my idea.  I've worked with VW buses now
for about 10 years.  In that course of time, I've found the battery
placement to be annoying and cumbersom.

For this reason, I'm thinking of moving the battery to underneath the
rear bench seat.  I guess the major concern about this is venting. 
Would this be a major health concern.. it puts off hydrogen when
charging, right???

Or, I guess the other option I'm thinking of is to leave it on the side
and put a marine cover over the battery so the rain water doesn't drip
on the battery and also so battery acid can't get on the metal... but
still, I just HATE the location of the battery.  It's such a hassle to
get in and out and dealing with the cables, etc...

Any thoughts on this?

thanks,
Mike
