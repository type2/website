Subject: New Fuel Lines (oy)

Afternoon fellow VW addicts,

 

I'm sure it's safe to say &quot;addict&quot; because if it were just a car to me I'd
take the damn thing to the shop!  HA.

 

Anyway, I just (about) finished installing the new fuel line assembly.  An
arduous task, but really necessary.  So many of the hoses were dried and
cracked, I'm blessed that there wasn't a fire.

 

It's about done, but it seems that the kit I got from German Auto in Canada
didn't come with the goose neck.  DOH!  I just ordered that from CIP.  So.
How should you change the gooseneck?  I can get to it thru the paint can lid
kinda, and I haven't put back the firewall or the last part of the filler
tube, so I can move it around pretty well.  But I cant figure out how to get
it in the hole after I get it on the end of the filler tube.

 

I read Rich Atwell's (Thanks Rich) &quot;gas tank&quot; page and it did show me one
very nice thing to know.  There are 2 hidden sheet metal screws holding the
firewall in place.  They were fun to remove.

 

If I ever meet the person who put those screws in there, ill slap him!  I'll
bet those 2 screws only come on buses that were imported into America.  LOL

 

So, the EFI rails were pretty easy but there is a small round gasket almost
O ring like thing on the end of each of the injectors.  Should I change
that?  They looked a bit dried out, and one was missing.  I just ordered
them from CIP too.  I'll change them whether they need it or not, I guess.

 

Finally, is there a trick to getting the firewall back into place?  It
wasn't the easiest thing to remove.

 

Yours in pain,

 

David.
