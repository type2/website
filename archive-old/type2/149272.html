Hi JT,

Congrats on the find, and having the perserverance to move ahead on  
such a daunting project. Stick with it and the rewards will be worth it.

Unfortunately, putting a 2L into a 71 bus is generally accepted as  
one of the more difficult engine transplants. The tin won't fit, and  
the engine has the wrong flywheel for the tranny and starter. And the  
2L engine is designed to hang from the 72-79 bay tranny, where the  
68-71 tranny is unable to support it. It's a nightmare, more or less.

Not that it *can't* be done with enough time/energy/money, just that  
if those resources are limited then they're better spent elsewhere.  
I'd recommend you trade that T4 for a T1, it'll make things a lot  
simpler.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
