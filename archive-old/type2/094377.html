&gt; It looks like it was designed to be stowed there.  Or
&gt; is it?  In my '69 Westy, the child's cot is stowed (I
&gt; believe) in the long flat area on top of the coat
&gt; closet.

It's designed for that.

&gt; I'm being anal retentive here, I know.  But that table
&gt; leg can be quite a projectile when not secured
&gt; somewhere, and I haven't found an ideal spot.

What I do, as it is stated in the owners manual, is to undo the hand stop,
swing it out of the way beside the sink and tighten the knob. You can also
store it under the rear set if you find yourself unfolding the rear seat
often.

The table top attaches lies upsided own to a strap at the base of the linen
closet with the leaf folded so it doesn't slide around while driving.
