&quot;Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away...
...In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military VAN.&quot;

That's the song that popped in my head when I was working on her shortly
after I got her.  73 Westy Poptop.
