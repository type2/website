&gt;&gt; I wanted to thank you publicly for the effort you made to make various
type
&gt;&gt; 2 manuals available to us all by scanning them and posting on thesamba
web
I guess I didn't make this(my jowels jiggling) PERFECTLY CLEAR.  Fred
Stoermer has scanned several bits of VW literature on a web site.  I found
it thru one of the search engines. www.thesamba_dot_com I think.  Follow the
links to VW literature.  I just wanted to thank Fred publicly, I am sure he
can speak for himself.
