Subject: Everybus 2000 weekend report (Looong)

I had the best time at Everybus2000 that I have ever had at a camping event,
in spite of the rain. Left Cincinnati, Oh. Thursday evening about 6:00 pm.
The first 120 miles to Jackson, Oh. were destined to get me in bus driving
mood- bus purring along, good music on the stereo, and a nice sunset as  I
went through the rolling hills of eastern Ohio. I then hit Rt. 35 going
south for a while which turned into a two lane road populated by 18 wheelers
(and me without a CB). I don't think they appreciated me too much even
though I kept a steady 55 MPH. Hitting W. Va. I think I started going up,
and up , and up. At 11:30 I stopped in Blinkly (?) for a well deserved rest.

Got up at 6:00 and hit the road. No oil leaks or even usage. Good sign. Day
was overcast and led to a trip of self thoughts and introspection. Decided
that I am totally insane and addicted to Buses (12 step program to follow)
For me, getting to the event is half the fun, allowing me to get back in
touch with myself.

Hit the camp grounds and met Chris and Judy right off. (I forget last names
so pleaseeee forgive me.) Hanging out, I met Dianna and Louise ( thanks for
the fire and the coffee). The Doc Ric and Chris S. pulled in with a friend
who had just scored a primo Westy side tent.

People started arriving quickly and I met a lot of list members. Dave
E.,David R., Andy W., Mitch?,. Friday night around the shelter fire was fun
with drums and guitars going strong. About 11:00 in rolls Steve D. and Niki
E. Dave J. was there but I was in too much of a stupor to meet him then:)
Met him and his engine building wife Sherry (I'm jealous) later.
Saw Sean B. and really felt like I was at home with a lot of good list
friends. It is really fun to have faces to put with names.

Saturday I met the Canadian brothers, Den, Jamie, and Dave I. I had gotten
the hub cap and box from Chris earlier and Jamie wanted to take it to the
Auburn Hills VOA show so I signed off and turned it over to him.

Sat. evening was the best pot luck dinner I have had in a long time. A
REALLY nice spread. Hanging out afterwards, I met Matt ? and chatted for a
while the burning engine case was lighting up the sky. I met Dave M. and his
friend Cindy- really great people.

The door prizes were terrific, both the kids and the adults. I won a Garcia
T-shirt. The guitars and the drums came out again and everyone had a great
time.

Sunday, got up at 6:30 and headed for the show at Farmington. Stopped at a
.25 car wash, spent 1/2 hr. cleaning up the bus and entered the show ( I
show the bus in order to get a good place to park and load all the junk I
usually buy at the swap meet) Saw a lot of the dealers that I had met up
North. The whole weekend seemed like a big family reunion.

Stayed until about 2:30 and pulled out because of incoming rain clouds. Told
the promoters of the show I was leaving early and they said hold on- checked
their sheets and gave me a 3 ft. trophy for Best of The Buses. Could have
knocked me over with a feather. A great cap-off to a WONDERFUL week-end.

I had such a good time I drove straight-thru getting home- great memories
all the way. Drove a total of 1467 miles, got about 18 MPG (mostly at 4000
rpm) with no trouble ( a few questionable moments, but I'll save that for
another time.

Many, many thanks to Chris and his group for one fine event.  In spite of
the rain, it turned out to be one of the best events I have ever been to.
Can't wait till next year.........
