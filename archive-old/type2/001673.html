&gt; The 76-79 Westy came as a standard or deluxe model.  The standard model
came
&gt; with an icebox rather than a fridge and a sink, but no stove.

Actually, 3 models: Non-pop top, standard w/pop top, and deluxe.

&gt; I think the
&gt; standard also lacked the trash can and fire extinguisher.  Both came with
&gt; all the curtains, child's hammock, front center table between seats, back
&gt; table attached to swing arm, swivel passenger seat, pop top, cabinets, and
&gt; wonderful plaid interiors.

The front center table only came in the deluxe.

&gt;The only extras the deluxe had was the stove
&gt; with a flip up cover, AC/DC fridge (not propane), trash can with matching
&gt; plaid cover, and fire extinguisher.

The fridge is 12v DC only. The AC power only runs the aux. battery battery
charger and the 120v outlet inside the bus.
