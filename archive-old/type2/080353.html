Subject: Re: [T2] most excellent fresh-air vent cover

Use the magnetic material until they steal it then you can go to tape
like me or get a few snaps and install a piece of flexible (cheap)
plastic.

&gt; Does sound like a super idea. If you're really worried 
&gt; some #$_at_&amp;!&amp;&amp;!&amp; will rip it off you could just pull it off 
&gt; and throw it inside when you park. 
&gt; I'd tend to agree with other listees that this wouldn't 
&gt; be a high priority item for you average thief, though 
&gt; you never can tell with #$_at_&amp;!&amp;&amp;!&amp;'s. (A #$_at_&amp;!&amp;&amp;!&amp; slashed the 
&gt; $1300 top on a friend's Honda S2000 to grab maybe $10-15 
&gt; worth of CD's) 
&gt; &gt; During one of the many desperate discussions on bus
&gt; &gt; heating, a list member passed along the tip to put a
&gt; &gt; strip of magnetic sign material over the front grill
&gt; &gt; on the bread loaf to block Ol' Man Winter's icy
&gt; &gt; fingers.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; A stroke of genius.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I stopped at one of those quick sign places and they
&gt; &gt; cut me a 5.5&quot;x36&quot; piece of gloss white magnetic
&gt; &gt; material and even rounded the corners for $13.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It looks like it's a permanent modification. (My only
&gt; &gt; fear is some #$_at_&amp;!&amp;&amp;!&amp; will rip it off in a parking lot.)
