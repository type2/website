Subject: Wife's demands

Since we are on the subject, I'm forced to admit that my '68 single cab
resto project has to go as we are moving aboard a sailboat soon and she
don't want to pay for storage for all the machines I have around here. I had
planned on restoring it for me but now it's restore it for a hypothetical
someone else. As this was my first job I'm wondering how best to come ahead
with this little debacle, or at least break even - restore with Maaco
quality, lower it and sell to some starry-eyed kid, trick the snot out of it
with premium paint, 4&quot; lowering, mags, funky engine etc. or go fully stock
and the best resto possible. There are so few of the early bay window single
cabs restored and for sale I'm not sure which way to go. Thoughts?

Nathaniel
