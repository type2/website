Hey Everybody,

&quot;I have a similiar problem with my 73 1700cc Dual-carb'ed bus, it sometimes
loses power for a minute or two when running at highway speed. No matter how
hard you matt the pedal, speed gradually drops to 35-40 MPH and I pull over.
Once at the side of the road, I rev the engine a few times to listen for
errant noises, but I am yet to hear anything unusual. But after a minute or
so curbside, it settles out and runs just fine.&quot;

    I too am having the same problem.  First a little background...  This is my daily driver, 64 mile round trip to work, most all highway, '72 1700cc, dual carbs, '74 dist timed at 10 ATDC with dwell of 48.  This first started happening on the way down to EveryBus.  At this time it was happening on a full tank and while I was approaching a hill.  On the way down we replaced the coil, fuel filters and set dwell and timing.  Didn't cure it..  At E-Bus I put on a new fuel pump.  Checked fuel pressure,  showing around 6 psi.  This seemed to take care of it.  Or so I thought...
    Everything was going fine after E-Bus... Until, I headed out for the Manassas, VA Bug-Out. It started again, I had just filled up the tank and it was happening on a hill.  I got to thinking it may be a clogged fuel tank vent line.  So I got to the tank and blew through the lines.  The T-fitting at the back of the engine compartment where the lines come together to one hose that runs to the evaporative canister was clogged.  I cleared the lines and fixed a few small rust holes at the top of the tank.  I thought I finally fixed this thing.
    I drove to work this week  whout incident.  Well it happened again last night on the way to the movies.  Not on a hill and with about 1-2 gallons in the tank, traveling around 60mph.  Now I'm at a loss and looking for suggestions.
    I removed the tank about 2 years ago and cleaned it out and installed that tall copper mesh screen in the tank.  I also put a magnet on the tank bottom to help keep things away from the hole.  In my case, I don't think any garbage in the tank is clogging things up.
    My brother and I are heading out West next weekend for 10 days and I'd really like to take care of this for good.  I don't want to get stranded in the middle of no where with a roached engine.
    I'm going to replace the dist. vacuum lines today and try and find any vacuum leaks.  Any other thoughts on what the problem may be???


Thanks for everything,
