Subject: '72 VW engine...Disconnected parts

Hello Group,

I just got a bus and I am trying to figure out where these
things connect to.

I own the Idiot's guide and VW service manual, but cannot
find a decent diagram which shows me where to connect hoses,
etc.

If you can point me in the right direction of ONLINE / book
diagrams, or tell me what these parts connect to, I would
appreciate it very much.

I have a '72 VW bus.  The following parts are disconnected:

1)shallow METAL rectangular box on top, center of engine.  With wire
clip holding top on.  A hose connection is unconnected, coming
from the right side of the box.  Air pressure comes from this
box in puffs while engine is running.

2)there is a hose connection on the left side of the engine,
right next to where coil connects to plastic shroud.  It
points to left side of engine compartment.  I haven't checked
if pressure or vacuum comes from this connection.

3)Vacuum switch mounted in center of engine compartment on TOP
or roof of compartment, right next to heater fan.  Has two small hose
connections and some wiring connecctions, none of them connected.

4)&quot;charcoal container?&quot;  mounted in top of engine compartment. This
has two hoses coming from it, neither connected.  The container
is oval shaped box.

5)Carb on the right has hose connection on top of air cleaner.  There
is a hose attached, but the other end is plugged.

6)(fuel pump?) on right side of engine, directly in front of the
valve cover.  Aluminum device.  Bolted to engine.  Fuel system
now has an electric pump.  Perhaps this could be old mechanical
pump?

When running the engine has a 'hiss' from the right side of the
engine.  Not constant, but puffs like exhaust or intake leak.  Think
it is either exhaust leak or one of these parts vacumming/releasing
pressure.

thanks for any help you can give
