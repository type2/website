&gt;Hi All,
&gt;I'm planning on installing a tachometer in my bus pretty soon, and i'm
&gt;wondering how to do it.  I figure that it probably isn't very tough because i
&gt;think all it requires is running some wires, but i could be totally wrong.
It's easy.  There's a wire to +12V when the ignition is on, and ground, and
one to the dash light circuit for the light in the tach, and one that goes
back to the ignition (negative side of the coil).  When running this wire,
you might want to run 2-3 extra wires alongside at the same time.  This way,
if you want to add other gauges in the future you're all set.  Just bundle
the extra wires up at each end and leave them unconnected.  And use different
colored wires.

&gt; In fact, i probably am totally wrong,  so i'm lookin' for a little guidance.
&gt; Thanks a lot.
&gt;also, would any tach work, like one out of an old ghia?
&gt;thanks in advance
VDO makes one (3.5&quot;?) that fits just right, in the dash location to the right
of the speedometer.  Make sure to get the optional bracket for this purpose.
RMMW is one source for these.  In fact, I just got a flier in the mail
that has a bunch of their gauges on sale but I don't remember off hand if
the tach was one of them.
