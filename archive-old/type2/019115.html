Subject: Insulating the 3&quot; pipe from the heaters to the front end...

Gentlefolk:

In keeping with the season, and the various discussions on improving the
heating systems, here's my two cents.  When I bought Brunhilda, my '73
Westie, the heater pipe under the bus that carries heat from the heater
boxes to the front end had been replaced with a thin, single-walled
piece of galvanized steel pipe.  The rest of the system worked O.K., but
you can imagine how much heat got up front after the
not-to-hot-to-start-with air got cooled down by subfreezing temps
howling at the uninsulated pipe at highway speeds in northern Idaho.

I finally went to a plumbing shop and got a piece of foam 3 inch hot
water pipe insulation, preformed and slit down one side, cut it to
length, popped it on the pipe, and sealed the seam and ends with duct
tape.  I have had it on since last fall, and it works great.  And it is
a reasonably cheap fix.

Regards,

Don Kaag
(...and Brunhilda II, the Westie Wonderbus...)
