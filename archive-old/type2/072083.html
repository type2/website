Subject: 72  a bad year?

On Sunday, 14 March, Duncan wrote:

&gt; If a car with a &quot;bad year&quot;
&gt; rap (IE , my 72) that has had a good owner, its better then a &quot;good
&gt; year&quot; car owned by a cowboy electrician. Thats my .o2s worth.

Duncan, my 72 has been really good, and I owned a string of 71's (and a few
earlier splitties) along the way . . . other than the aggravation of
workin' on it (no access thru upper deck - been thinking about getting
handy with a circular saw) what are the unique problems with the 72 ??

Just wondering!
