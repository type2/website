Well, I just had to share my good news. At least I know you guys will care. (OK, some of you!)  I decided many
years too late to buy a good rolling jack and some stands.  I'm starting to do a lot of work that I used to
pay to have done. Seems like VW's sucker you into that. Anyhow, I  checked Harbor Freight, Pepboys, Autozone,
etc. And guess what?  The Sears Essentials store near my house had a 3 ton jack  for $59!  It's a bit heavy,
but I'm really impressed with it.  It goes almost 20&quot; high and is solid as a rock.  I found it on the Sears
website. They didn't have one on the shelf at this store but I asked about it and they had three of them in
the stock  room. I can go look at the part number if anyone else is interested.

 A neighbor has a H. F. Chinese 2 ton unit.  It wouldn't hold my Jag up!  It is a heavy car, but come on.
This one is no problem.  And they had the good sturdy 3 ton jack stands on sale  for $18.  So I've got plans!
And no more borrowing my  neighbors jack.   And I love seeing that 'Craftsman' that was  $10 cheaper than
'Hong Kong Freight'.  Oh well, it's probably  Chinese too, but I've had good luck with Sears' stuff.  Up next,
steering box.  And Spring has arrived a bit early down South.  Thanks for listening.  Cheers....KR

I am still looking for metric jack stands.......

Sounds like the HF one has blown its seals.  Cheaper to replace it than repair it!  I used to have a
Hein-Warner floor jack, was big $$$ when I bought it new..... it also blew its seals internally. Cheaper to
buy a HF floor jack than fix it also. And so far the HF Chinese one has outlasted the high $$ one!
