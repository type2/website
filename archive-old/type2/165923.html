Subject: Re: [T2] Wooden bus...

That wooden bus reminds me of a wooden VW beetle I saw in 1973.  I was
driving a brand new '73 thing at the time, the first one in the
neighborhood.  The owner of the beetle was more interested in the Thing
than he was in telling me about the wooden VW.

The story was that the beetle's body had rusted badly.  He couldn't afford
to do the bodywork to fix it, so he built a wooden body for it using lumber
that he sawed from trees that he had cut down from behind his house.  It
was built as a convertible (had no top or side windows) and believe it or
not, he actually drove it year round for the first couple of years he had
it.  His wife did admit that it was kinda cold sometimes in the winter... 

As to running the wooden bus on wood gas...my dad tells me that during WWII
buying gas was such a problem that a few inventive folks built trailers
with &quot;cookers&quot; mounted on them.  Wood chips were placed in a large sealed
kettle and a hose was run from it through a valve to the motor's manifold. 
A fire was built under the kettle.  After waiting a few minutes for the
gasses to start coming off the wood chips, they were ready to go.  They'd
start the motor on gasoline, and once running they'd turn the valve and
drive off running on wood chips!  I'm told they had to stop every now and
then to stoke the fire or add more chips, but it was better than nothing.
