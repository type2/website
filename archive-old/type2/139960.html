&gt; I get the sense that maybe I'm asking too many questions.
&gt; 
&gt; But consider the aim: I want a bus in my driveway that I could climb 
&gt; into on a moment's notice and drive from San Diego to Bar Harbor, Maine 
&gt; and back with just an oil change in Bar Harbor. No &quot;can it make it?&quot; No 
&gt; calls on AIRS. Just driving, looking at the scenery, and listening to 
&gt; Allman Brothers on my iTunes.
&gt; 
&gt; And if I can do it, anybody can do it.

Hey Mark Sounds good to me  that is bar harbor but maybe not this time of the 
year better in warmer time of the year. I would have choosen Key West for 
now.  The Allman Brothers are one of my fav road riding groups.  I got to see 
them a bunch , saw them play with the dead and also The Band  later and have fun
