Subject: Re: [T2] cheap oil temp guage?

Chris,
I found this in my search last week.  

http://www.geneberg_dot_com/tempdipstickhtm.htm

If you do order from them, let me know your
experience, I am thinking of getting one myself.  I am
sure several others have ordered from them, maybe they
can relay any luck - good/bad with the product or the
company.  Best of Luck,

&gt; hi all...i'm lookin to invest in an oil temp guage,
&gt; now that my 1500mile west&gt;midwest summer travels are
&gt; gettin ready to happen. i read in the library, the
&gt; post about taken a digital candy/meat thermometer
&gt; and riggin it up to your dipstick. but i've yet to
&gt; find a thermometer in my small town that i can work
&gt; with. i've also been reading through the archives,
&gt; trying to find a post that i had read several weeks
&gt; ago. where the person had mentioned a dipstick oil
&gt; temp guage with an idiot warning light, that ran
&gt; around 20$. but i can't seem to find this post
&gt; again. 
&gt; if you have any ideas on how i can go about gettin a
&gt; cheap oil temp reading, please share. i'd prefer not
&gt; to spend the 50+$ for a HQ guage, but i guess that's
&gt; actually pretty cheap compared to over heating,
&gt; somewhere down the road. 
&gt; thanks for all the help, peace, -Chris 70'westie
