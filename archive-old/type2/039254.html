Subject: type4 fan/pulley

I swear there is not a timing notch on my pulley. The motor in the 1972 bus
is a CB case which is correct for that year.  I have learned to get around
the lack of a correct notch but now I am starting to wonder........

If I full the plastic plug from the top of the fan housing and look at the
fan as I hand crank the motor I see the red and black marks that Muir
mentions in his book as a timing mark for the 411/412 vehicles.  Do these
marks appear on all type 4 motors(bus/411/412/914) or just the 411/412.
I ask this question because I wonder sometime in the past a PO swapped fanss
for some reason. As cheap as VW was it makes more sense that they used the
same fan on all the motors but you never know.

I also wonder about the red and black mark. Muir says the black is 5 btdc.
Why? Why not a mark a TDC that matches up with the notch? And what of the
mysterious red mark. Seems like I figured it out one but have since
forgotten where it falls. Anyone know?
