Subject: Re: [T2] turn signal indicator works only in one side

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; My 71 Westy blinks the right side of turn indicator in the guage even I make
&gt; left turn. So it blinks whenever I signal right AND left... I inspected the
&gt; wiring and the wire splits off of the right to left. So I switched so the
&gt; split off from left to right, but no blinking on either of them, but I could
&gt; still hear the flasher...
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know what is happening?

They all blink both sides in that era.  Kind of silly, and I think that VW
intended to split the circuit into left and right sides later on.  Did it
ever happen toward the end of the baywindows?
