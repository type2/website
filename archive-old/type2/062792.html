Subject: Need painting tip

I've spray painted a few cars/buses with generally good results.  However,
these have all been 'one colour' jobs, or in the case of our 76 bus a two
colour (white roof/ yellow body).

One thing I've always wondered about - consider the case of painting a
split bus in two colours with the colour 'join' typically being just below
the belt line.  You mask the bottom off and paint the top half and the mask
to the line you want and paint the bottom half

.......how do you stop the little 'ridge' that results from painting to a
masked line?
