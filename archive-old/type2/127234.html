Subject: RE: [T2] OUCH $150 for a mechanical fuel pump, how about   
  electric?!?!?!?!?

&gt; If you're getting a different fuel pressure than is expected, it can
&gt; effect the way your engine runs.  It can also be a fire hazard if
&gt; improperly installed, etc.

If you use the correct type of pump the pressure will be right.
IE dont use a FI pump on a carb.
It should have a cut-off type relay installed for safety.
