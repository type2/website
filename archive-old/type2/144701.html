Then had them powdercoated. Paint would look just as good. I like
sandblasting! I like the sand because no hidden acid residue left over to
surprise you later - not likely but it is something to be careful about.

I go the opposite route.  Every time I change tires I wire-brush the wheel
with a rotary wire brush, then give it a nice coat of Krylon silver (a
fair match for the original silver).  The tire shop gets &quot;silverwall&quot;
tires to dispose of and I don't worry about a stray rock chipping the
paint or powdercoating.
