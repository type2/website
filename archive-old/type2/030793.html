&gt;I have this puddle that will collect in the upright closet (meant for hanging

I too have dealt with this problem.

At my last residence, Casa del Deliverance, I had to park on a downhill
slope.  Water being what it is, it infiltrated my rear hatch and proceeded
to soak my back deck as well as the insides of the closet.  Turned out to
be a TOTALLY rotten rear hatch seal.

The fix?  I'm glad you asked.  I'll slip into my sneakers and sweater and
tell you.  Move.  Or buy gravel.  This is to hill up the front of the bus
when parked.  Therefore water cannot soak your closet.

I chose the former, moved to the new abode, La Maison sur la Petite
Montagne.  Uphill parking.  No more water woes.

Probably cost LOTS more than a new seal, but now I have a garage with
CONCRETE on the floor.

It's the little things in life.
