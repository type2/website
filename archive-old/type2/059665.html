&gt;When I had my old computer at my last job I was able to find the
&gt;origional VW font on the internet,  the font is the one with the
&gt;single line underneath it.

Try &lt;http://www.anet-chi_dot_com/~vwlovr66/&gt;, a beautiful site. I found it by
searching the archives. Hint Hint. Of course the archives don't say
anything about font, but I knew what page I was looking for. It's called
the People's Press.
