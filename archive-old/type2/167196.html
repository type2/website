Subject: RE: [T2] 1776 for 1971 Westy

I just recently did my first full rebuild (to longblock so far). Had done a
few top end rebuilds before (head jops, new pistons/cylinders).

I would suggest you stick with stock for your first time. The cost for parts
will be less and it seems anything bigger tends to compromise reliability and
economy for alot of people.

If you shop around for a good used crank and rods that are rebuildable you can
save some of the cash that way. Lean towards a new case but I was lucky and
found a good low mileage brazilian mag case that didn't need any machining -
don't use a beetle case without the bus support inserts. New
pistons/cylinders, cam, lifters, heads. I have the bug me engine build video
and highly recommend it to see if you want to do the build yourself to get a
good taste of the job.

Also I have a set of stock rods and crank that may or may not be rebuildable I
can sell you cheap.

Nashville TN&gt; &gt; What is a good price for a 1776 longblock?&gt; What is a good,
reputable place, to get a longblock?&gt; Should I build from scratch or go with
longblock?
