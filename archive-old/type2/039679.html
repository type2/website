Subject: Used spares, FI -&gt; carbs DON&quot;T DO IT RANT!

	[Crick, Bill ]  SNIP....
&gt;  I don't know about you but when I buy new tires I buy 4 not 5, I put the
&gt; 4
&gt; on the bus then take the best of the older ones to use as a spare.
&gt; whenever I changed my points, or rotor, or plugs even I always threw the
&gt; old ones into an ammo can that I carry for emergencies.  why buy new parts
&gt; for spares when you have working used parts...these are &quot;SPARE&quot; parts they
&gt; are to &quot;get you home&quot; not to replace the parts in use.  
	[Crick, Bill ]  The other good thing about these used spares
	is that they are proven to work. You know they worked when you
	take them off. I once saved myself a loooooonnnngggg walk
	when as a last ditch effort to fix a dead car, I put the old ratty 
	plugs I'd pulled out the day before, and replaced the brand new
ones.
	To this day I still don't know what was wrong with those new plugs.
	My Dad claimed he said he knew - they were Champion brand.
	He'd sworn off Champions after a new set made him walk a loonng walk
	25 years earlier;-0

	Seeinas its Friday I'm going to comment on the religious debate
about FI to carbs
	conversions. 
	&gt;RANT -on
	1. My bus has FI, and it has started with no problems from -40F to
+100F.
	    It also starts every spring with 3-4 turns of the engine. Some
years I've just put the battery 
	   back in without even charging it first -&gt; rrr rrr rrr Bug bug bug
bug bug bug .....
	2. Someone said if you don't know much about it, stick with what
came with it. I agree 
	3. Someone also mentioned that one of the issues with FI is it has
very few 
	  adjustments, and you should almost never need to adjust anything.
This frustrates 
	  people who like to tinker, and fiddle with knobs. However re-read
point two and see if
	  you really want to be tinkering with knobs you don't understand.
The nice thing about
	  FI is it works or it doesn't, and if it doesn't something needs to
be fixed, not adjusted.
	 Note often what needs to be fixed is a dirty ground connection, or
a leaking vacuum hose, 
	 not anything complex. 


	&gt;RANT -off
