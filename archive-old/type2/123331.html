Subject: Re: failure notice

Sounds reasonable. I may be (okay, I almost certainly am) betraying my 
near-total ignorance of the ignition system, but is the CDI box something 
that would (could) be installed along with something like the Pertronix 
electronic ignition, or instead of it?

Does anyone know how good the documentation for these sorts of things are? 
(I remember my first carburator rebuild consisted of reading Muir -- who 
simply said &quot;go get a rebuild kit and follow the instructions&quot; -- only to 
discover that the &quot;instructions&quot; consisted of nothing more than an 
exploded view of the carb. Oh sure, I got it done okay, but it took three 
days.)

&gt; Hm, well, the way I *imagined* them working is basically:
&gt; 
&gt; 	* Wires from Coil + moved to CDI +.
&gt; 
&gt; 	* Ignition signal from [points, Hall sensor, etc.] in distributor
&gt; 	  (that would normally go to Coil -) connected to trigger input
&gt; 	  on CDI.
&gt; 
&gt; 	* CDI output wired to Coil +.
&gt; 
&gt; ...with the CDI giving a large jolt to the coil when the ignition 
&gt; triggers, rather than the normal +12.  Presumably you need a coil 
&gt; capable of handling the larger voltage on the primary side, and also 
&gt; need to widen your plug gap so you reap some benefit from the massive 
&gt; spark that is hopefully produced.
