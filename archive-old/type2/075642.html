Subject: Fuel Pump for a 78

Fellow Bus owners:

I have figured out that my fuel pump is locked up or
something. I took it out and it whirs, but it will not
pull gas.  Is there a way of fixing it?  Paying $127~
for a rebuilt pump is out of my league right now.  I
have bid on one on Ebarf and some guy bids it up
higher.  Anyways, anybody have a used one for sale for
cheap, That works?  Can I cut mine open, free the
obstruction or rust, and have my room mate tig weld it
back together?

Any Ideas? Any Help?

Thanks
