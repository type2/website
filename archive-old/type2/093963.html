Subject: Re: [T2] AC Conversion to new &quot;Freon&quot;

Hopefully i am doing this reply right-advise me if wrong and it gets
sent to the wrong areas. (mailer daemon didnt like first one)
I was just checking the archives myself looking for anything i could
find on ac and didnt find anything for the conversion.
