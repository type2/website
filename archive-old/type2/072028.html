Hey gang,

I am selling my 73 Campmobile.  Here are the particulars:

Pretty straight body.  No major dents.  Some minor rust along door edges
and in rain gutters.  Battery tray area needs to be replaced, but it still
holds the battery just fine.

All camping equipment is present.  Overhead cot, hammock for front seats,
all cushions, cabinets, canopy, mosquito netting are present and in good to
excellent shape.  The canvas in the pop-top is still decent, but would need
to be replaced soon (the zippers are malfunctioning).

Fresh 1.7l engine with progressive Weber

Fresh tranny and clutch

New wheels and tires

Recent brake job

New front seat foams and covers.

Runs great, interior is clean and nice, brakes are awesome.

Pictures are available at:

The pictures are a little on the flattering side.  It does not look quite
that nice in person, but it is a pretty darn nice daily driver.

Will need some minor body work and paint.  Originally orange inside and
out, but has been primed in a very pale white/grey primer.

This is a great camper, and just needs a little bit more work to be a rel gem.

I am asking $2800 obo, but I am also very interested in trading for a
pre-73 Beetle or Ghia.

Thanks!
Dave
