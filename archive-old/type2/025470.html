&gt; I have a 78 Westy, 2.0 L engine w/FI. The reference to &quot;type*&quot; has me somewhat
&gt; confused. I believe I have a type2 body style w/ a typeIV engine. Is this
&gt; correct? What is the difference between a Type2 and TypeIV engine? This may be
&gt; elementary to this knowledgeable list , but is confusing to me.

Body type and engine type are different.

All Buses are in body Type 2. This Type is complex through necessity, since
everything from singlecab pickups to regular vans to fire engines to ice
cream trucks fall into it. (Question for the regulars: There's a gentleman
somewhere in the United States who owns a complete and working Firewagen.
Have the show organizers at places he exhibits this vehicle started setting
fires for him to extinguish? I heard once that some show was planning to do
just that, to demonstrate the Firewagen in its proper element.)

All VWs have a Type--bugs, things, Karmann Ghias and cabriolets are Type 1,
buses are Type 2, squarebacks, fastbacks and notchbacks are Type 3, and the
Type 4 says what it is on the back. I know Rabbits are type 11; what other
Types there are I don't know.

Aircooled Type 2 vehicles can have one of two engines. Through 1971 (US
version) Buses had the same basic engine as the Bugs. After that in the US,
they had the Type 4 engine; if you have fuel injection on your bus it's a
Type 4 engine. These are larger than Type 1 engines (smallest Type 4 engine
is 100cc larger than the largest Type 1 engine--1776s made in someone's
garage do not count here), they're more robust, and the cooling system is
way, way different.
