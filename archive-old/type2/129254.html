Subject: diagnosing a misfire

So, here's how my engine runs:

brrrrrrrrr bump brrrrr bump brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr bump brrrrrrrrrrrr 
bump brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr bump.

Where the bumps are noticable misfires with not definable pattern.  It 
does this at all rpms.  Does anyone have a good way to diagnose this? 
I'm guessing it probably has something to do with ignition, but I'd like 
to hear some input before I go at it.  I really want to clean up all 
these misfires and get it running like butter.

thanks,
MIke
