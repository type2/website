Subject: RE: [T2] Oil Analysis

&quot;Ted Finesman&quot; &lt;tedebare_at_one_dot_net&gt; wrote:
&gt;The procedure is to drain 4 ozs.of hot engine oil
&gt;into the supplied plastic bottle. Send it to the
&gt;company and in about a week, you will receive a
&gt;report that tells the metal content of the various kinds 
&gt;of metal in the oil. My 4000 mile oil report showed a
&gt;little more copper than average; however, the report
&gt;credited this to the break-in of the engine.

The key to the oil analysis is to look for trends.
Perform another test(s) at the same mileage interval
and compare the results.  Yours was with a new engine
so you may want to perform a couple more tests over
the next year or two and see how the results compare.
Don't include too many variables, like switching oil
brands, etc between tests.

&gt;The oil analysis has made me feel a lot more
&gt;comfortable about the functioning of my engine and
&gt;confidence in the engine's durability. 

It's somewhat like reading the results from a blood
test.  :-)  You have more information about what's
going on inside.

&gt;Well worth the $25.00 the test costs. Ted 

I used Performance Analysis Company in Knoxville, TN
a few years ago.  They tested my MB turbodiesel's oil
several times with kits which came in a three-pack.
The price per test was about $15, IIRC.

The results included Fe, Al, Cu, Cr, Pb, Sn, Na, &quot;dirt&quot;,
&quot;soot&quot;, fuel, water, &quot;solids&quot;, glycol &amp; viscosity levels
from the 1 oz. dirty oil sample I mailed them.
