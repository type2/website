Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic ignition opposed to points &amp; condenser


Hello Friends!

I've installed electronic ignition in all of my VWs (and my kid's VWs), and I've never had a problem with them. Never have to adjust points again!

I work at a VW/Honda repair shop in Greenville, SC, and we've sold a lot of these. I *have* seen them go bad. They can't be fixed, they have to be replaced. 

I keep a spare distributer, new points already set, with clamp attached (already set up for proper timing) in my spare parts stash, just in case. All I have to do is drop it in, and it's ready to go. 

david
