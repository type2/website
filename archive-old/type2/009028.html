A neighbor came up to me today and asked if I would want his 
vanagon   seats, the driver and passenger front one... for my 78 bus, 
I know that they fit, so I said yeah I want them, he offered them for 
50 bucks for the two of em, is that much? seems like it to me. 
ps if anyone lives near the dc area like me, and has two front seats 
or even one, that they dont need and are willing to let go for less 
than 50 for a pair, please let me know ...email me at 
joshua_lowell_at_hotmail_dot_com if possible...
cheers
joshua
