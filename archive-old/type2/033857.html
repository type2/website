Subject: Status of Great Bus Tour baton and other trivia

Hey, Craig...Marv Krupp here. I received the baton from Joy McMahan on
Sunday. She came to our house near Burnsville, NC. We plied her with lunch,
homemade wine, and the BBC fantastic VW camper 20 min video: it worked...she
bought the $150 hulk of a 68 camper that we rescued from the crusher. Will
pick it up next spring.

Yesterday, did 400 plus miles in my 71 SC to Greensboro area to pass the
baton to Chris C. Helped him load his dinged 68 loaf onto trailer of Wayne,
from VA...who does restos for a living, I think. Chris and I went to lunch
at a mom and pop (actually a henchman and his assistant) pizza place to
exchange the hub cap and box. I gave him a bottle of wine (I make it in huge
quantities :), and one for the next people on the tour..Matt and Pollly
Freeeman. They're from Hillsboro, NC...nice couple. Not sure when the
transfer takes place.

Procedure:

Take pic of transfer with throwaway camera in the box: sign the hubcap: make
an entry in the logbook...after reading the saga so far, of course: look
through all the little additions to the box :)  You're right..I'm picturing
a steamer trunk by the time this thing gets to the Aussies. But for now OK.
BTW, Joy gave me a nice model of a panel truck when she visited: didn't have
to, her great smile was enough..a very upbeat woman:)

Saw 2 busses only in the long, wet, foggy trip yesterday,,,one I had to stop
to assist...but I'll save that for another time...kinda sad story.

I'll be off line for a few days...FINALLY going south tomorrow. Contact
Chris..on the tour list..and he'll update the status of the tour.

Regards, Marv Krupp...600 miles tomorrow, dragging a KG with 71 SC, using
the Rube Goldberg rig I made to haul ANY type VW..I think (OK w/ T1 &amp; T2 so
far :)
