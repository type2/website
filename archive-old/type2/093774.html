Subject: RE: [T2] Are these new or restored? - 2002 Type 2

Hi Jay, 

I've been off list for a couple of weeks on holiday so I've missed the start of this thread and may be repeating things already said. 

Your signature line doesn't say where you live - if you live in the USA or Canada then a perusal of the list archives will save you leg work as others have already found out out that they do not meet the import requirements for those countries. If you live elsewhere then start with your local vehicle licensing authority to find out what the requirements are for your country. 

Most parts are the same as for a '79. Major body exceptions are the roof, and removable rear valance, everything else could be replaced with 70's parts. 

The engine also is the same as a late '70s 1600cc engine, but the fuel management system is NOT. It is a multipoint fuel injection system giving 28mpg (imperial) at 60mph. Combined with the catalytic convertor this gives a very clean exhaust (0.00% CO and 35ppm HC, on mine; that's with the engine cold by the way) I'm told this will meet even current California emissions standards. 

I believe that you are correct in saying that the conversions being offered are the same as the flat-pack Just Kamper conversions, with obvious modifications to allow for the different roof line. 

You should also note (for you continued existence on the list) that the charter specifically excludes discussion of post '83 aircooled VW buses - a change made just after I purchased my Brazilian Camper in '98. 

As for the cost being high, here in the UK a T4 based camper would cost 50 to 60% more so you make up your own mind as to the value... 

If you have any specific questions regarding the Brazilian T2s (which have now ceased production) please feel free to ask off list. 

Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; 	I just got an email back from Jason at beetles-uk_dot_com.  He states
&gt; that the Type 2's are 100%new, built in Brasil and then converted in the UK.
&gt; They are fuel injected 1600cc with catalytic converter.  After a quick
&gt; currency conversion, it appears that the price quoted for the Rio Camper is
&gt; approximately $19,250.00 before shipping from the UK, so they are not
&gt; exactly cheap to say the least.  I am not sure of availability of parts ('79
&gt; spec?). 
&gt; 	Perhaps if a few listees got together and did a group purchase we
&gt; could get a better price from the dealer and do a consolidated shipment in a
&gt; 40' container ( I think 6 Type 2's should fit in a normal shipping
&gt; container).  
&gt; 	I also emailed justkampers_dot_com about these Type2's, as the photos of
&gt; their Flat Pack Interiors match the interiors on the beetles-uk_dot_com page
&gt; exactly.  I will post again about my findings after their reply.
