Subject: Engine rebuild Q's 73 1776

Help,

I've had my bus in the shop (vw only) for a month for a rebuild, new carb,
clutch, overall going over.  Well I just got it back yea I thought...
Well when I picked it up (It was broken down 100 miles away)  The mechanic
told my  Dad who picked it up that one of the valves was sticking.  After
300 miles I checked them and they were all set at .006 except #3 which both
valves were tight in.I just don't have time to adjust my valves every 300
miles and shouldn't have to. I have a 1776 73 .  Well so far I've already
burned 1 quart of oil, old engine barely burned or leaked a drop.  The new
engine is running so hot you can not touch the top of the dipstick after
driving 30 minutes.  And the gas mileage is way down about 10 miles per
gallon.   The bus is definitly going back but my questions to the list are
what can I tell him to look at for the valves he has no idea why it keeps
tightening.  Also if any one on the list is from Charleston S.C. Do you
have any comments on big wheels?  I'm really starting to worry. 

TIA

Please help

Peace
Snoopy
