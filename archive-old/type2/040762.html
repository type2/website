Subject: fuel filler neck replacement tips

Hi guys,
Doin' the fuel filler hose/venthose  fix to try to eliminate gas smells.
Surprisingly the big filler hose was in good shape, still flexible with no
cracks but the connection at the tank was loose (been replaced before?)
Vent pipe connections shot replaced all 5
Filler elbow torn, replacement purchased.
Now does anyone who has replaced this know how?
Even with all the covers off I would have to be tripple jointed and able to
see around corners.
what is the trick way to do it?
thanks
Jeff
