&gt;During the course of our conversation, Bill pointed out a unique feature 
&gt;on my '76 double cab. In the right rear corner of the passenger cab (on 
&gt;the exterior) is a small vent that goes down into the interior of the 
&gt;cab. It then makes a couple of right hand turns through a plastic part, 
&gt;and then the passageway goes through one of the frame rails all the way 
&gt;back to the engine compartment.

I have this too on my '73 ('74 model) single cab, i also had it on my '78 single,
and i'm pretty sure it's standard on every later baywindow, i dono when VW
started with this though, i also saw it on my friends '73 (also '74 model) 
double cab. If you have a 1600 upright engine in it you'll have a plastic
airfilter housing on the right in the engine compartment, the filter element
that fits this housing is the same as the one used for dual carb T4 engined 
Buses, the filter housing is connected via a rubber elbow to the right 
underbed rail, so this set up is simply the engine's air intake.

Hope it helps,

Brian.
