&gt; Funny poem! However, I've been inspired by Mr. Dave Bolen to try to 
&gt; tweak my
&gt; heat system to get it to blow HOT air. Pie in the sky? We'll see.

It's not that difficult.  My stock, unmodified heat system blows air 
out the windshield defroster vents hot enough for me to have difficulty 
holding my hands over them, with a good rush of air coming out starting 
at about 2000 RPM.

The only thing I'm going to do to my heat system is de-stink it by 
replacing the paper tube with a nice, fresh aluminum duct wrapped in 
insulation and by cleaning the accordian tubes.

&gt; I've already checked the seals along the whole system, and they seemed 
&gt; fine.
&gt; I did _not_ seal everything with hi temp gasket sealant, but I might 
&gt; now.
&gt; See, when I'm idling in the driveway before work, I can feel a slight 
&gt; push
&gt; of air from the vent. At the top of the RPMs, I feel almost nothing, 
&gt; though
&gt; the vents are eventually warm. My plan is to see if there is some 
&gt; blockage
&gt; somewhere along the line with poking and prodding with the vacuum 
&gt; cleaner
&gt; attachment.

Hm... is this a symptom of missing the little mini-flaps at the bottom 
of the fan shroud?

&gt; Wish me luck!

All the best!
