Subject: Re: spiral easy out

There are some drill bits that you can buy for easy
outs, that work in reverse mode. In order to drill the
hole for the easy out insert you have to put your
drill in reverse. This make the process a little easy
since the insert turns the same way. I have
successfully use it many times. 
Good luck!
Alex
