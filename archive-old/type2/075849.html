Subject: front knocking noise

Hello,

I was riding along in my 71 Westy today and all of sudden a knocking noise
comes from what sounds like the passenger sides front tire. The sound is
irregular and I can hear more as soon as I took my foot off the gas pedal.
Does anyone have idea what this might be?

Thanks!
William
