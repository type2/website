About the strip:

&gt;white plastic trim strip on the inside of the window covering the gap
&gt;between the window and body.  This is the *only* one of these strips I
&gt;have ever seen.


I have one of these, except that mine's light grey, not white.  I'm
looking for a match for the opposite side, if I can find one.  Anyone?

Also, on the crank placement, mine are as follows:

drivers' side: towards the back
pass.side:     towards the front

These windows are reported to be original, never removed.
