Subject: Brakes pulling to the right.
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I've had my '70 Dormobile for a few months. It's not a daily driver. I told 
myself before I bought her that I would try and improve my very limited 
skills by trying to do the work myself. I bought Bentley and Muir, and that's 
been my night reading.
I posted a while back about a  strange occurance, but didn't get many 
responses. The first time I would drive the bus on a given day, she would 
pull noticeably to the right. This would be the only time it would happen 
while being driven until she sat  overnight again.
Yesterday it started happening each time I brake. I need to get this fixed. I 
may be coping out on my committment to learn to do my own work here, but I'm 
a little afraid to let my first repair job ever be to the things that make 
the bus keep from running into something; especially since I generally have 
my two year old son with me. My questions are 1, should I attempt this? 2,is 
this maybe as simple as a clogged line? 3, If I get into the system, attempt 
the repairs, and get the brakes bled and holding pressure, am I  O.K. then or 
is it possible that I could have forgotten something or done something that 
could cause them to fail later? 
I also need to know what &quot;power brakes means&quot;? I read in Muir that they made 
a front brake change in '70, which is what mine is, but I have the original 
invoce and it shows up as a &quot;purchased option&quot;
Looking forward to your thoughts.
