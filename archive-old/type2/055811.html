Subject: '67 tranny in a '60...

hey volks,

well, the tranny swap is complete. this whole thing started by wishing i
had a parking brake and thinking what an easy and rewarding little
project it would be...  it soon led into finding out how crappy my
cylinders and shoes really were and then that i had different redux
boxes and...

anyway, here i am and i am indeed happy. with the old tranny and
mismatched redux boxes (doh!), i felt comfortable cruising on the
highway at about 55. my only indicator being engine noise, tranny whine,
and pedal. no fancy guages on my stock dash :-) anyway, now it seems
real comfy somewhere between 60 and 65. feels like there's still a bit
of room up there too, but this is fine with me :-)  got a bunch of other
stuff done while i was at it too. this is the best my bus has felt since
i got her. got a felling this is contageous :-)

tony
