Subject: Re: loss of power 

The main thing that changed the way the vehicle runs is that it was towed.

I would suspect damage to some system that was involved in the tow, when it 
was violently moved to the impound in an un-natural manner, from wherever 
it was parked. If possible, I would find out the details of how it was 
lifted and moved. Did the tow truck raise it from the front, or from the 
rear? Where were the lifting hooks placed?

Perhaps you will get nowhere with those questions, and w2il need to make 
some assumptions: Since it is an automatic, they probably lifted from the 
rear, to avoid the locked up transmission that was in park.

The lifting hooks may have invaded some component or perhaps crushed 
something, or broken something. It could be electrical, vacuum, fuel 
transport, air induction, or exhaust flow. I would suspect exhaust flow, 
because the lifting hooks and straps/chains probably went under the engine 
and around the axles on each side, with the lifting pressure applied upward 
on the exhaust system/heat exchangers. Get under there and look for scrapes 
and gouges and punctured/crushed components. Its a beginning.

I recently got my bus back from impound. It was running perfect before it
went in. Now it dies sometimes on startup. especially if i give it a little
gas it will sound like its gonna be ok, but when I let off the gas it wants
to die. This only happens sometimes. A lot of the time it is starting fine.
But I am experiencing a severe loss of power. I can still get up to highway
speeds, but it takes a while and is using a lot of power. It uses as much
power to reach 20-30 mph as it used to use to reach 50-60.
thanks.
