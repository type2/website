&gt; from what i understand regarding octane ratings, they're based on a somewhat 
&gt; misleading premise anyway.  
&gt; 
&gt; Every (?) hydrocarbon (carbon-based chains with hydrogen bonded to it, e.g. 
&gt; propane, butane, hexane, octane, etc.) has a specific octane rating associated 
&gt; with it

Well, kind of.  Octane rating is simply a measure of the resistance of a
fuel to detonation (pre-ignition, knock).  the cause of detonation is a
very complex combination of chemistry and physics, and was never explained
to me.  This does not matter, since the method of measuring it is a rather
emperical, and therefore does not relate to any basic principles of
science.  Suffice to say that detonation is bad and we need a good way to
determine the detonation point of fuels.

Octane is measured on a special test engine.  The engine is turned by a
large electric motor to assure constant speed and has a
temperature-controlled water jacket to assure constant temperature.  The
cylinder head is adjustable for compression ratio while the engine is
running.

The fuel being tested is run and the compression is increased until
detonation occurs (this is measured with a sensor, not by ear).  The
position of the compression is noted.

Next, the engine is run on a mixture of two standard fuels, Octane, and
n-heptane (IIRC).  Octane has an octane rating of 100, while n-Heptane has
an octane rating of 0.  The percentage of octane in the mixture therefore
determines the octane rating.  

Once a mixture is found with the same
detonation point as the test fuel, The octane precentage of that fuel is
the octane rating.

Of course, the compression control can be calibrated so that you don't
have to  mix test fuels all the time!  You can also extrapolate the scale
up a bit to get octanes better than 100.

Note that octane measures only one thing: detonation resistance.  It has
nothing to do with heat value, flame temperature, or the astrological sign
of the fuel engineer.

The only differenct between the RON and MON scales is the conditions under
which the test engine is run.
