Subject: [T2] Driving in the Snow

Hey guys!

It is getting closer and closer to road trip time, and I want to make sure
all of my bases are covered! I am a little nervous because this will be the
first big trip in our new bus, and I am certainly not going to know when the
timing is off and how I would go about fixing it (although I do have lots of
books!) My boyfriend knows more than me, and so far the bus has been
performing beautifully! We went on a little camping trip to the redwoods
without anything going wrong! I am going to have to get used to sleeping in
dark, quite, peaceful places, sleeping in the camper is a definitely a new
experience for me.

We just installed a VDO oil temp gauge, although being in Utah in winter I
don't think we will have to monitor that very much! We also have a new oil
filter and oil and the rebuilt engine only has 15,000 on it!  In any case, I
wanted to get some advice about driving in the snow. Our mechanic, ya know,
the one who came with the car? Well, he suggested that we use the cable
chains and on all four tires and to go slow. I don't know what else one
could tell me about driving in the snow, but if you think of anything......

Also, if anyone has a good list of things not to be without on a road trip
in the winter...belts, nuts, pumps, etc! The AIRS list! :)

Thanks!
Cara
