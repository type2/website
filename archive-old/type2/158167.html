Subject: Re: I got the wrong part!

Jeez,  everybody!

I meant no disrespect to Bus Depot.  It could have been any online 
vendor.  My previous post wasn't even a gripe.

What did I say in the subject line?  I said, &quot;I got the wrong part.&quot;

Did I say, &quot;Bus Depot sent the wrong part!&quot;?

I said (paraphrasing) &quot;I ordered part X and I got part Y.&quot; and in so 
saying, I mentioned one of our favorite online vendors.

Since I am going on a road trip next week, I need a quick fix to my 
problem, and I was hoping to get some help from the collective wisdom 
of the list instead of having to hassle the vendor with it.  If I 
reorder, I will need it sent overnight, and I stand the chance of 
getting the wrong part again.

Hell, it wasn't even their mistake.  The box from the (re)manufacturer 
was mislabeled.

&gt; Volks,
&gt; 	Chris got a good bashing from the list for including a vendor in his
&gt; gripe. Perhaps it's inappropriate and should have not included the 
&gt; name,
&gt; but if you want to publicly bash someone please include an answer to 
&gt; his
&gt; question, which is what he really wanted to know
