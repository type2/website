&gt;hello
&gt;This was easily found on Type 2 Archive, but the blackhole here, is How can
&gt;we change our Air Flow Meter by a Air Pressure, AND where or on what kind of
&gt;scrapyard car can we find such a thing!!!

Mike,
1. you remove the air flow meter
2. you insert a tube from the MAP sensor (mounted in the MS box)  to a 
place on your intake plenum
3. You need to fit a throttle position sensor (TPS) to your throttle body 
(TB).  This might be easier to do by getting a TB with a TPS in the 
junkyard that would fit to your plenum.
4. Don't forget the crank sensor (I forget what MS is using for this)

&gt;Once we found a Air Pressure Sensor, well have to fit it on our intake
&gt;plenum.... im i right ?  N change at all except the air intake where we get
&gt;rid of the AFM then replaced by the MAP ?

The air pressure sensor comes in the kit if you buy the parts kit in the 
group buy.  Otherwise, digikey stocks them.

&gt;Then at the end we have to modify our wire harness so it will connect to the
&gt;megasquirt

YEP

&gt;Anyone can add comment/technical website/ tips ?    ECU are getting much
&gt;rare everyday, at the end if we ant to continue to use FI it will be
&gt;Megasquirt or a complete overhaul with CIS !!

I'm currently running CIS - 2L hydraulic, stuck into a '60 Double cab.
Planning on building up another engine with a turbo and using megasquirt.

Scott
