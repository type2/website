Brad,
    Before you head out and kill the PO of your bus, check by the front (front
meaning flywheel) of your engine, there's a diagonal flat spot with numbers-
look at the right engine mounting nut and go left.  If you do find numbers in
this place, this just means that you engine was borrowed from a 914, 411, or
412.  If you don't find any numbers you engine is either stolen, or was
rebuild somewhere down the line.  I have no idea why some engine builders feel
they have to wipe out the case numbers when they rebuild, but they do.  One
outfit here stamps their initials where the numbers should be...Ugh!  I myself
stamp my engines under the oil cooler and then use the stock ID numbers for
identification.  Go figure!
   Peace, Love, and if your engine was stolen in the past, there is nothing
you can do                       
        can do about it, just give it a good home and love it.
         Mr. Bubble Head
