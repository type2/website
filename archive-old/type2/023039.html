The VDO sump plate sender used in the Porsche 914 measures the temperature 
from exactly the same spot as a dipstick sender.  I've provided proof of 
this in the past and yet some people still seem to think that this sump 
sender is somehow inferior to a dipstick sender.  If you really want the 
hassle of wires hanging in your engine compartment and having to carry a 
separate dipstick with you and insert it every time you want to check the 
oil, be my guest - but don't do it because you think you are getting a 
better reading in &quot;hotter oil&quot; because it's simply not true.
