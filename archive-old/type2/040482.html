Oh god, I feel like such a doofus today! &lt;grin&gt;

I remember on my bug, there was a sensor on the bottom of the engine.  I 
don't remember where it was bolted, but I remember it was a plug of some 
kind.  Whether it was the relief valve or the drain plug I don't remember, 
but I don't recall having to take it off when doing oil changes.

I do know it worked really well, tho.
