&gt;I don't understand why VWAG has an aggressive attitude 
&gt;towards old VWs/ repro part makers for them- it is a market they abandoned 
&gt;ages ago, so why not let someone else fill it?  

You got that backwards. The market abandoned them.

Through the years VWoA has been a source for genuine German parts, to the
point that the lack of interest in parts designed and manufactured to last
20 years+ in favor of aftermarket stuff designed to be cheap. If owners who
bought an early VW because they thought they were made of cheap parts, they
should reflect on their rationality. The early VW's have such a good
overall reputation for being ecomomical only when they are comprized of
real VW specification parts. But they last three times as long as the
wannabees at twice the cost, typically. Where is true value?

Wait till you have to rely upon a Henco en Mexico clutch cross shaft. Then
judge VWoA for &quot;overpricing&quot; the cost for a real precision piece of high
metalurgy that not only fuctions properly, but, as intended, does so
through at least three long life clutches, if they as well are genuine.

VWoA cannot keep costs within reason if only 10% of the smaller early
market seek the value of the real deal. They can't run off a few thousand
proper cross shafts that take 5 years or more to sell to the few. Now if at
least 50% of the early VW croud through the years were buying from the OEM
source, they would surly still be there for us now that the genuine parts
are FINALLY worn beyond specification.

No one here can set up a new production of a true specification cross shaft
at the last and now no longer avaliable VWoA price. Certainly not for 10%
or less of the market that demands reality as opposed to the 90% who demand
the cheapest facade that looks like the real deal. Let's hope this attitude
of accepting facade over substance can be reversed now that the Clinton era
has ended. 

This truly is a sence of values issue. VWoA must maintain profitability or
die. It is not a goverment agency that can burdon the future with
inefficientcies now. They are bound to endeavor to balance their books
every year while in major competition fighting for the big current market
shares and the demand for current production and later model parts. It is
inevitable that they must move on from the large to us but small to them
needs of an ever diminishing market that in great majority do not
understand the value of real parts.
