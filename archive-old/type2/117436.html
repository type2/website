&gt; While replacing my heat exchangers yesterday I noticed that the flaps on the
&gt; fan shroud are missing on mine. I know I've read about these flaps but can't
&gt; remember exactly what they are for. Something about the airflow while the
&gt; booster fan is off or something like that right? My question is, are these
&gt; flaps a critical part of the cooling for my motor? Should I pull my exhaust
&gt; again and replace them? I really dont want to if I dont have to. It was a real
&gt; PITA to get everything lined back up and bolted.

the flaps are critical for the proper cooling of the type IV engine...less
of a PITA to put them in now than rebuild the overheated engine later
