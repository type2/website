Subject: Re: [T2] Really loud bus- need advise before proceeding!

I chased a loud engine noise for quite a while, until it revealed  
itself: if the rivets that hold the gear to the camshaft are going,  
the engine will be really loud with no obvious cause.

To look for leaks, it's a good idea -- in theory -- to use some kind  
of stethoscope to find the sound. The problem is that you have to  
guard your hearing somehow. I use a piece of (watercooled) heater  
hose, and hold it an inch or two away from my ear to isolate engine  
noises.

Mark - currently without bus
