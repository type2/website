Subject: Swamp cooler source(s)?

List,

I know this is at least an annual run but, does anyone remember who makes
and/or sells the different swamp coolers (evaporative coolers) that are
small enough for our buses?  Seems there was a vent-mounted model and
one that sat between the two front seats?  Any help appreciated...
