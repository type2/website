Subject: Any More Power from a Pertronix &quot;Flame Thrower&quot; coil?

------=_NextPart_001_0002_01C1BE3F.5B423FD0

I'm looking at an advertisment from Pertronix about their &quot;Flame-Thrower&quot;=
 coil.  It says it &quot;maximizes energy and reliability over the full RPM ra=
nge&quot; and allows for larger plug gaps, which produces greater fuel efficie=
ncy and power.  I'm running a basically stock set-up in my '71.  Upgraded=
 to a Bosch 009 Distributor and Pertronix Ignitor.  Have always felt unde=
r-engined.  Can I get a few more hp out of a hot coil?  How much, as a pe=
rcent?  Is there a down side?  Harder on the engine?  Thx.
