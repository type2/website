Subject: Re: [T2] pilot bearing problem?

Sounds more like a clutch throw out bearing. $20 bucks from bus depot, piece of cake to install, as long you know how to pull the engine, that is ;-)

Hi,

I've read some posts here and maybe I am having pilot bearing problem. I
press in the clutch pedal and I hear something grinding on 71 Westy. It
happens pretty much whenever the clutch pedal is pressed. Am I having pilot
bearing problem? If so, do I need to remove the engine? How much would it
cost to have it done by local VW shop?

Thanks!
William
