&gt;First off, I'm looking for a VW bus in the Gatlinsburg area, or one
&gt;that would be able to go there for a few days. Mine is in Michigan and
&gt;right now in pieces. I don't want to drive the bus, but park it and
&gt;use it as a sort of canvas....sort of.

&gt;So......anybody game?

&gt;'69 VW bus
&gt;'81 VW Jetta
&gt;'89 VW Jetta GLI
&gt;'96 VW Jetta GLS   (the Jetta is Betta); and an
&gt;'86 Porsche 944

I'm posting an addendum...
There are twenty-two polymer-clay artists, several clay guilds and one
very large Clay conference getting very excited about covering a van
with clay. The idea is to portion out sections of the surface to
different artists who will then make a panel that when finished will
be attatched to the van. (Using a light coating of SoBo glue) 
The van would be on display for a week, and then the panels would be
auctioned off with all proceeds going to charity. 
We are trying to get in contact with Volkswagon America, to see if
they will sponsor us, also Fimo Clay (by Eberhard Faber, another
German company). 
Please, we need a van. If no one near Gatlinsburg is willing to loan
us one; could you at least give me the name of a VW dealer or repair
service in the area?
Thanks;
Eileen
