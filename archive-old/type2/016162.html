It's the vinegar in the sauce that does this.  Works well on cucumbers so
why not just pickle the whole bus?

This is a parlor trick but I have often thought of trying it out on the
connectors that  Steve is talking about. Get yourself a dingy old penny and
a bottle of Tobasco Sauce(yum, I love that stuff.) Put a drop or two on the
penny. Wipe it away and watch the shine. 

I am certain there is a basic chemical process going on here. Acids and
bases or something of that nature. Is the oxidation on the brass connector
the same as that on a common copper penny? Just curious. And lets not forget
that Tobasco Sauce is bio-degradable.
