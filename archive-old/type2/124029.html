Subject: Re: [T2] interesting fuel lines in photo

What I have done on my Bus is replace all the lines with solid steel lines.
You can get them from any auto parts store. They usually come with fittings
on both ends anyway. I use a purolator (bugpak) electric fuel pump as well.
Basically, I have the fuel pump mounted to the floor of the engine
compartment (on the drivers side where there's no battery or anything). I
then have teh steel lines go directly from the tank all the way to the pump.
I then have a steel line comming out of the fuel pump, going into a glass
encased fuel filter. On the other end of teh fuel filter is a rubber hose
fitting. I attach a brand new piece of rubber fuel line from the filter to
the carb.

Seems to work out real well. I picked up a LOT of horsepower as well. Before
it would take me nearly a minute to get to 45 miles an hour.. not I can get
up to 60 in no time.

Granted, it's no TransAm, but it gets going a lot faster now than it did
with the old original lines. I suspect I was sucking up air.

Subject: [T2] interesting fuel lines in photo


&gt; Several times in the photos of engines that appear in VWT mag, most
&gt; recently on page 94 of the September issue, I see what appear to be
&gt; braided steel lines with compression fittings delivering fuel to
&gt; monster carbs.
