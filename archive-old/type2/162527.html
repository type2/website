&gt; Finally, I have 10 wheels on rims that have to be resolved.  Only one is
&gt; acceptable as a spare, one is a classic original 29 year old rayon belted 8
&gt; ply tire / 6 ply rated, four are dry rotted, and four came from the '76
&gt; Safare that was in the garage from 1989 thru 2004.  New thread, but
&gt; internally the belts are busting


I think I might need a rim or two for my 78 one is bad and leaking at the
bead, are you coming to John Brown,s Buses this weekend??
