Subject: Re: [T2] My 77 is a leaker.

From Terry K:

I know of no one who has gotten away without doing this unsavory task.
 
Too much garbage in the way--like sheet metal for instance, aluminum
cover's &amp; shrouds.
 
It would be a much simpler job with the engine in your lap.
 
 I have never heard of anyone removing the tubes without cutting them
first and replacing them with spring loaded tubes.
 
A real crummy job on an air cooled engine.

She has a type 4 engine.

Yes, the tubes come out after she removes the rockers and the pushrods.

NO, she does not have to remove the engine or the heads.

What engine did YOU say you put hydraulics in??
