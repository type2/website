Subject: [T2] Starting/FI problem on '78 2.0 FI bus

&gt; Diagnosis:  Battery voltage at rest is 12.5 volts. 
&gt; There was no current at
&gt; the cold start connector while cranking.  This was
&gt; true whether using the
&gt; TTS as ground or using an alternate ground.  I think
&gt; this means no power
&gt; from the double relay terminal 86.  I confirmed this
&gt; and found also no
&gt; current at terminal 86a from the solenoid (while
&gt; cranking).
     
Sounds like the Fuel Pump Relay is bad. ??? Assuming
the Fuel Pump Relay AKA Dual Relay is getting the
source power required, doesn't Bentley`s say of the
Dual Relay, crank engine and test for voltage on [86a]
 If none during cranking, replace relay?  Back up a
step or two in Bentley to confirm the source power is
present.  If not, then the problem is electrically
higher in the wiring path.
    
Having a WR1 does insert another diagnostic step or
two into your diagnosis.  Confirm your dual relay is
getting it's source power.
    
On the other hand, installing a replacement dual
relay.... see if it will start cold.  If it does, then
you have found the problem.
