Well... you don't have to, but if you don't you need to get out the ol'
dremel mototool and carve your tin back a hair.  I installed this sender
on my '80, which has the same sender as any T4 and the same hole in the
tin.  The diameter of the 360006 sender is about 5mm (~1/8&quot;) larger than
the hole in the tin :-(  and the hole has an extreme up-and-down component
as well as the circle.  If you look at the hole from above with one eye
closed, it looks like and is a circle.  open both eyes and/or move off to
one side and it gets hellishly complicated.  the secret of success is to
close one eye, drop the sender in and trace around it while looking down
from directly above.  then take the dremel and carve away the affected
area.  This resulted, in my bus, in a very small gap between the sender
and the tin, which is important because you cannot install the stock seal
with the 360006 sender, even with the extension pipe.  there is *some*
interference between the sender and the distributor with this installation
method, but it can be dealt with.  I will try to get a picture tonight.
