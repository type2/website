&gt; &gt; I've been lucky enough to score work space in a professional shop
in town,
&gt; &gt; and as I sat in the barrel of Safety-Kleen scrubbing my grubby tin
in
&gt; &gt; preparation for a marriage with an AVP longblock, I got to
wondering: Why do
&gt; &gt; we paint tin? I've always been told Rustoleum, maybe the high-heat
kind.
&gt; &gt; Presumably this is a dumb question, but I guess the underside will
rust if
&gt; &gt; it's wet.

&quot;High-heat&quot; paint is certainly not needed in this application.  The
tin should never get so hot that a high-heat paint would be the only
thing you'd expect to &quot;stick.&quot;  Most any rattle-can paint should do
just fine.
