Subject: Propane Furnace info?

I have this &quot;Carlson Industries&quot; furnace in my bus (see photos:
http://tinyurl_dot_com/dk5b3), but I know nothing about it and cannot find
anything on the web or in the archives.  It is hooked up to the propane
cylinder under the sliding door, which I believe is empty.  I have not
yet tried to light it, but it has an instruction plate attached, so I
might just have to get the propane filled and try it.  Sorry the photos
of the plates are not legible and I have not yet transcribed them.  Does
anybody know anything about it?  Is there a fan built-in, or is it just
radiant?  I'm pretty sure the answer is no, but does anybody know if you
can run one of these while driving?  My whole heating system is messed
up, and I really don't want to have to buy a new setup before the winter
if not necessary.

Thanks,
