Christopher,
	I went and took some pics of my engine bay and posted them on my
site.  Check them out here.  www.wicals_dot_com/troy/vw/enginebay/index.htm
I did not compress these images as to hopefully give you as much detail
as possible.  I just replaced all my vaccum lines recently as well as
the throttle body gasket and it did a world of help.  I would highly
recommend this be done if your lines look worn.  Also look at the fuel
lines.  Let me know if you need different angles or more pics.  

Good luck

Troy

fellow listmembers......

I have been working on finding all of the &quot;this isn't connected to
anything&quot;
type stuff
and putting it all back together regardless of how important it seems,
and
still working
on these tubes that come out of the fuel system someplace, I believe to
help
it breathe.

The top right hand side of my charcoal canister, there is a thin little
tube
that goes noplace
currently, and I think that is part of this same system.

Here is a pic of what I do have now, I think I am definetly missing some
of
those items.
Could you take a look at this and see what I'll need to get this put
back
together correctly?

Just not sure what I need to order, or if I can get what I need at a
hardware store/flaps to fix this?

thanks for any tips, info, tomfoolery you can shed on the subject...

Christopher
