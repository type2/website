Subject: Check those fuel hoses
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hi er-
I have recently found similar- after looking at the fuel hoses they appeared
OK but when I drained the tank and started dismantling, the one that attaches
to the steel fuel line above #3, broke easily. I had also previously put a
grommet on the metal line where it goes through the firewall but noticed that
there were two grooves in the metal where it had previously rubbed against the
tin. I am replacing the metal fuel line and probably doing the &quot;Hoover&quot; mod to
avoid future problems. My advise to anyone would be to replace the whole fuel
line and check the steel tube when you get a new bus and you are not sure of
its history!!! .. better safe than sorry..
