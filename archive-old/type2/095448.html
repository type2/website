Subject: *Long distance drivers arrive for OCTO!...

Well, yesterday I picked up Britt's daughter, Katelyn at the San Diego 
airport, and a little after we got back home, Lou and Liz arrived in 
their beautiful bus!  We had a great meal prepared by Amy, sat around 
and laughed and told stories, and then Dan and Isaiah drove up in Dan's 
beautiful Binz! I wouldn't do until Dan washed down his baby and got it 
settled in the driveway. Turned out it wouldn't fit in the garage, 
(BINDY (!)) cause the rack and the tilt were too tall! Then, he and 
Isaiah came in and ate , then had showers, and then we all went to bed. 
Woke up Dan, Isaiah and Lou at 4 AM, as they wanted to get to the OCTO 
show when they opened the gates. As they were driving off, I noticed a 
puddle that didn't look like rain water, and when Dan checked it, it was 
oil that his filter had spit out! The Fram's gasket had crimped, and he 
was pouring out oil! Fortunately I had a Bosch oil filter, (Thanks Bus 
Depot!) Dan installed it, with a quart of Valvoline (thanks Lou) and 
they were on their way. Amy, Katelyn, Liz and myself will leave after I 
send this and meet them at OCTO.

Wishing you all could be here with us...
