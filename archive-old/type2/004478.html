Hey guys,
Got a battery question for you all.  I have an Interstate deep cycle battery
that I've been having trouble with, doesn't seem to like to hold a charge.

I filled up the cells w/ water, put it on the battery charger and left it
until the charge scale went down to 0 amps.  I put a voltmeter on it and
found a reading of 12.5v.  So far so good.  However, when I use my little
specific gravity meter (one of those droppers with the four floating balls
in it), in two cells I get one floating ball (4 is full charge).  So I get
one floating ball in 2 different cells, however in the other 4 cells, NONE
of the balls float.

So I'm assuming this means that I've got a little surface charge on the
battery and that the battery is in fact toast.  If it were to be subjected
to any kind of load it would probably fail.  Is this a correct assessment?

The only other variable is my specific gravity meter as it's the first time
I've used this particular one so I haven't checked it out on a known good
battery.  On the other hand, those little dropper meters are not exactly
something that should stop working properly so I tend to believe it's
accurate :-)

Your opinions please...
