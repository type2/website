Subject: Petrol Tank Breather 

Hello

I hope someone out there can help me.....

I am finishing a resto on my 73 westfalia.

On the top of my tank I have a fuel Elbow that leads straight onto the
breather pipes.  This elbow has perished and although theoretically no fuel
runs through this pipe I don't want to put this old one back on because of
the petrol Vapour.  I don't want to stick normal fuel hose on there incase
it kinks and effects the breather system.

I can't seem to get a replacement for this anywhere.  I have tried VW, the
local VW/Camper &quot;Specialists&quot; and companies that I know produce fuel hose
and no-one can help me

Does anyone have any ideas where I can either get a replacement or of a
modification I can make ?

Thanks in advance
