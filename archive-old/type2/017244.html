No problem, Harry, glad to help where I can. Of course, you made me
think, and that's a bad thing! :) 

It occurred to me that if one had an electric blower and the appropriate
tubes between it and the heat exchanger, but the plastic flappers are
missing, air would be pumped back into the engine compartment from the
cooling fan. This air would be preheated by traveling over about 1/3 of
the heat exchanger. It would then be sucked back into the cooling fan
and recirculated. 

This is the way I was originally running the '73... I wonder if this
contributed to the demise of the POs engine (along with the lack of
thermostat, wide open holes in the cooling tin, 1/4&quot; of oil &amp; dirt on
the case, etc, etc!).

To the list: Am I oversimplifying this situation, or is this really a
bad thing? The air that comes back through might be minimal, but it
would probably be worse in the summer when the heater control box is
closed off.

&gt; Thank you for taking the time to explain my question. I think this
&gt; explanation should be put in the library!
