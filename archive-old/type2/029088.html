Hi Volks,

Long time no email.  We weathered another Seattle Winter and now that
camping season is coming, I have to get rid of my buses.  My apartment
complex was just bought and the new landlords allow only running vehicles on
the premises.

I picked up a 79 Westy last fall that needs engine work.  It fired up when I
got it, with some difficulty, but obviously needed some engine work.  I had
hoped to rebuild it, but hadn't the space, tools, talent or cash and now I'm
running low on time.  In any case, it's a poptop 79 with the fridge, stove,
sink, ect.  The body is dinged, but fixable.  Scott Solomon found her for me
last year, so he might remember a few details I'm forgetting.  It has a
2000cc that someone pulled the FI out of and rplaced with a singe carb. ?!
It'll need to be towed.  I'm looking to get $350 for her as that is how much
she cost me to pull her out of a field near Olympia and get her cleaned up
and to Seattle.  This bus has no title, thus the cheap price, but I have the
paperwork around here somewhere.

The other bus is a '72 ASI Riviera poptop.  It has a good 1700 with dual
Solexes and was tuned up about a month ago.  The autoshop was Aker's Foreign
Auto on Broadway, who I absolutley DON'T recommend.  The bus went in for a
tuneup and came out with the heater boxes filled with oil.  The cab filled
with smoke and Aker's refused to fix it without charging me.  Anyway. she
had a clutch and new brakes put in last year.  She runs, but I think she'd
be best used for parts.  The steering box is going, all the bearings need
repacking, etc and the body has the cancer pretty bad.  Karen and I pulled
out the Zbed and restuffed it with futon material and recovered it in a
beautiful thick clothed paisley.  We made a new cushion for the back desk,
also with futon material and new vinyl, but never made it's paisley cover.
I have the material though.  I've putat least $2500 into this bus, but
somewhere my heart broke under the strain.  She was too much of a burden to
keep dumping money into when she would never be a great bus due to the
cancer.  I hate to think of her going to the grave for parts, but know it's
inevitable and that her parts can keep other buses going. I think she's
really only worth her parts now, so make me an offer.

Now before you think I've gone Honda or something, let me just say that I
will be looking for another bus in the future, but not as much of a fixer
upper as these were.  I'm also applying for the Peace Corp, and would have
needed to sell them anyway before I go.

You can see them at 1814 12th Ave in Seattle, between Denny and Howell.
They're parked off street side by side in front of my apartment building.
You can call me at (206) 726-9217 if you have any questions.  I'll be in and
out all weekend.

Landon
