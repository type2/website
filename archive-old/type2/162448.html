&gt; Regular Lurker, needing help in starting on my 77

&gt; Regular transmission leak - 1 quart a month; finally
&gt; reached an apex and today lost all power, high engine
&gt; RPMs and no-go !  I know I topped the fluid off a week
&gt; ago and doubt I ran out.  A fair bit of smoke,
&gt; obviously burning ATF from under the bus, what little
&gt; ATF remains is blackish/brown and smells burnt.

possible loss of fluid, possible the pump has gone

&gt; Should I just assume it is blown and remove ?  Or is
&gt; it possible I ran dry and could just drain what is
&gt; left, put in new filter and pray ?

it doesn't hurt to try putting some fluid in

&gt; I'm leaning towards just pulling the whole thing since
&gt; it was leeking in the first place, I've been riding on
&gt; borrowed time for awhile and time has run out.
&gt;
&gt; Where are the reputable re-builders of a 77 Automatic
&gt; Transmission [would a local place be qualified to
&gt; rebuild or would they just send it out anyway...].

I have found maybe two auto tranny places in the country that I might send
my 78 auto tranny (same as yours) to and one is in North Carolina and the
other is on the west coast, you are looking at in excess of $1,000 from
anyone worth his beans...

the tranny itself is mostly the same as a Jetta and parts are still
avaliable.

personally I would start looking for a good used one.. figure about $250
or so for one in decent shape.

and be VERY VERY carefull with the shift linkage taking it out.

follow the Bentley exactly even if it sounds crazy it's right

&gt; No Go and looking for advice in Kansas City

good luck
