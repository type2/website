&gt;Hello,

&gt;I am having a problem with the front disk brakes on my 71

&gt;westy.  They are continually clamped hard on the rotor.  When
&gt;
&gt;driving this causes both sides to smoke and it becomes harder
&gt;
&gt;and harder to drive.  I rebuilt the calipers and bolted them
&gt;
&gt;back up and bled the brake lines, but it still happens.  Could
&gt;
&gt;it possibly be the lines, calipers or the fact that the brake
&gt;
&gt;booster is not working properly and had been removed from the
&gt;
&gt;vacuuum on the motor.  I am at a loss I thought rebuilding the
&gt;
&gt;calipers would solve it.

It is probably the rubber brake hoses.  They tend to clog up with age.  If
you remove the hose from the caliper the fluid should continually drip out.
My guess is that when you remove yours, you will get a drop or two and
then nothing.  If so, replace the rubber hose.
