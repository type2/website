Subject: Thanks, brakes sorted

Hi,

Thanks to all those who replied to my questions about sticking brakes. I checked the rubber hose on the wheel giving me problems and it was almost completely closed up on the inside. I replaced it and now I've been able to adjust the brake shoes and handbrake as normal.

I used a long piece of plastic twine and inserted it into the brake line at the wheel. Once I couldn't insert it any further the length pointed straight to the rubber hose. Wish I'd checked it before, this problem has been with me for a years!!

Thanks again,

Al
