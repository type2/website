I just wanted to see if anyone else has had this happen to them . It seems
that one day my bus started running really bad . I got to the back and
realized that the 5 (i think) screws that hold down the carburator had all
come unscrewed almost to the last thread . They screwed back in nice and
snug and no problems yet . Could this be natural due to vibration ?
