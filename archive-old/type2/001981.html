Hi  all  ,
        I  am writing  again to  say  I am  parting  out    my  collection ,
so  here  goes  I  have  1968-1973 kombis and campers. I  have  to make room
for other  projects  now that  my  74  is on the  road  give  me  all  your
lists  so that  i can help you  find  the  parts  that you  all  need  .
        I  am looking  for a  stewart warner heater  for the  engine
compartment. Inside  door  handle  for the  inside sliding  door .

Thanks  Darrel
