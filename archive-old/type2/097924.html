Subject: brake lights question

I've been trying to sort out the wiring on the new-to-me 69 Westy.
The PO installed new taillights, my father-in-law tells me that
they are generic Ford taillights, as seen on many flatbed trucks.
The PO did a great job of fitting these to the Westy, but the
wiring is pretty scary.  For some reason, the PO taped-up and
set-aside the original wiring for the taillights, and ran new
wiring from the back to the front, creating many opportunities
for a fire (wires running through holes in the metal, no grommetts...)
I plan to eventually resume use of the original wires, once I test
them all and get them sorted out, hooray for the color coded wires!

Anyway, I've sorted most of the wiring out, except for the brake
lights.  The original wiring to the master cylinder appears to still
be there, but again, taped-up out of the way.  The &quot;new&quot; wire for the
brake lights was disconnected.  So now I have 2 switches to figure out.

I was wondering if, for testing purposes only, I could wire up the hot
to one side of 1 switch and then the wire to the brake lights to the
other side of the one switch, skipping the other switch altogether?

Both of the switches on the MC seem to be closed (allowing
juice to pass through), is that normal?  Or perhaps they
are stuck closed?  (This van was garaged for 8 years...)

Thanks,

Rob
