&gt; Unlikely.  I'm not receiving any of the above.  Sounds like it is time for
&gt; you to get a new account.  D*** spammers....  A pox on them and on those
&gt; stupid enough to respond to them.
&gt;

   And remember, NEVER, click that &quot;to be removed from our mailing
list&quot;...;-(
That only sends a message that there's a warm body on the other side of the
