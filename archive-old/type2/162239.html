Subject: Re: [T2] rear seat belt bolt size

oh, just get the guy at Lowes and tell him you are looking for that
illusive M11 x 1.25 square nut....  Isn't it funny how the 7/16-20 is sooo
close that it actually works &quot;well&quot; with the 8.8 grade M11 x 1.25 bolt?


&gt; Yes, seat belt holddown bolts are standardized worldwide. 7/16-20


Have a great day!
