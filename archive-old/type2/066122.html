Subject: The height of my van

Hi everybody

I have found a cheap place to store my van for the winter. A warm place in
the inside.

But the height limit is 6 feet. Do you know what is the exactly height of
my van. It's a 76 westfalia WITHOUT pop-top.

If you don't know, I can take the measurement. But if you have the
information, it can help me.


Thank
