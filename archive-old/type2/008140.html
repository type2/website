Hi,

I am trying to get a hold of Bus Boys in Redding California but their
(916) 244-1616 phone number only leaves me with a disconnected number
message. Does anyone know if their number has changed or if they possibly
moved to another location? My friend was in their shop a couple of weeks
ago to buy an IRS II conversion kit for his 66 bus so it's probably not
the later. Anyway..if their number changed, does anyone have it, or could
someone post the info. on whether they're still at the same place? It's 
important because I need to find out whether they have the special brake
lines for the conversion IRS conversion.

Thanks,

Chris
