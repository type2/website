Subject: RE: Kombi definition w/insurance ?

&gt; 
&gt; On my policy for my 75 Campmobile it lists my van a being 
a Kombi under
&gt; the area of Model. 

well technically your campmobile is based on a komi so i 
guess it could be construed as stil being a kombi

FWIW up here you get better rates if you can convince the 
Insurance Company your van is a motorhome cos I guess their 
rates are based on little old lady/men that drive their 
motorhome very little and then park it somewhere for a long 
time and sit arounf making tacky patio lights or wood burnt 
signs etc.
