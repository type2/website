Hi all,

    I was wondering if you guys could help me out; I was recently under my
bus when i realized that my thermostat wasn't hooked up.  I see that a long
cable is just hanging off of it.  What exactly does the thermostat do for my
bus and also how do i fix it. or should i replace it.  I have probably
driven my bus for 5,000 miles withit unattatched.oops.

Thanks
