Subject: paint shop in Eugene?
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;
Importance: Normal

X-Envelope-To: type2

Good people,
Can anyone recommend a paint shop or individual in the Eugene, OR area that
has painted buses?  I'm looking for a quality job (vs. an el cheapo job),
and prefer to go to the &quot;little guy&quot; over the big chains.  It has to be real
local because I've got all the glass out and trim off, and I'm just going to
tape the tail light lenses on and drive to the paint shop to have the work
done.

TIA,

Paul

ps: this list rocks!
