I'm a Product Manager at a software firm.  I gain an understanding of what
our customers (and prospects!) want, and what technologies might be
available to fulfill those needs.  In other words, I dream up the features,
and other people write 'em.  

I'm also responsible for much of the art direction in our product graphics,
and on parts of the Web site.  And &quot;other duties as assigned,&quot; as always.

Can't prove that it pays enough to &quot;maintain the Bus,&quot; as I have been
following a dedicated practice of benign neglect for the last several years.
However, I am turning that around now.  :-)
