I'v been urged by several listees to post the details of our recent trip
from Northern Calif to mainland Mexico - a Ferry boat ride over to Baja -
and return, in our 73 Westy...

On a previous posting upon our return last week, I mentioned we traveled
about 2,900 miles without any problems with our bus at all...I had
been replacing lots of chassis' stuff on the bus prior to our trip, but the
engine was a bit
of an 'unknown'...the previous owner had a shop rebuild the stock 1700
engine
about 10K miles back (over 5 yrs ago) prior to our taking ownership last
November...The engine runs great, no smoke, just a few minor oil 'weeps', so
I said let's go for it - and it turned out fine...

This trip description was e-mailed to friends &amp; family from a couple of
Internet Cafes along the way, and chapter 1 starts a little 'slow', but the
reading gets better in the later chapters...Due to the length, I will post
in four 'chapters'...something to build on, as they say... Below is chapter
1 of 4...

Ray Cellar - 73 'Semi-Westy' with a new name to be announced in chapter 4...
Stockton, CA


Ray &amp; Pat’s 1999 Mexican Adventure....Chapter 1

Hola, everyone...

Well, Pat &amp; Ray made it all the way to San Carlos (Guaymas) Mexico, Wed Feb
17th. in the afternoon... We left Stockton Feb 14th, at 7 AM &amp; headed for a
short stop in San Luis Obispo to see our son Jason at Cal-Poly....rumor has
it he will be a college grad, come this June!!!...we had a great lunch with
Jason at a diner on Hwy 101 just south of the Madonna Inn, called Margie’
s...Wow, they had the greatest 'home fries' made from cubed Stockton Delta
New potatoes!!!...yummy, and lots of em'...

We then headed South on Hwy 101 for San Bernardino to visit with Ray’s Aunt
and
Uncle...Uncle Bill will celebrate his 98th - yes, his 98th birthday this
year. He had recently been honored with his 75 year pin as a Mason...Bill is
the only surviving member of his W.W.I Warship crew... Each day he raises
the ‘Colors’ on a flagpole in their front yard, which he did before we left
on Monday morning... I got a neat picture, while Bill hummed revelry - not
unlike our boating friend, Author Hal Shell, who has the habit of breaking
out his bugle at 8 AM each morning when out on his boat to announce it’s
time to greet another day on the  California Delta!  (plug-plug check out:
www_dot_californiadelta_dot_org to see why boating is our other fav way to cruise)

During our 'trek' South, we were able to experience one of the LA area’s
great 1-1/2 hour 'jams' on  the freeway...I guess nobody gets through there
without that ‘Freeway Crawl’ experience!!!...I can still feel the ‘clutch
foot’ ache...

Early Monday morning, we were again on the road headed towards
Phoenix......We stopped at a rest stop out in the desert and broke out a
large platter of frozen shrimp with cocktail sauce we had stashed in our
cooler to thaw...We then had to wash down the shrimp with some ice cold
Coors...We sure got some strange looks from others as we savored those pink
critters way out there in the middle of nowhere!!!...

We have a great time cruising in our 1973, stock, VW Westy Bus...it's bright
'Cal-Trans' Orange...I have been working it over getting ready for the trip,
and it has behaved perfectly, so far...I had earlier removed the fiberglass
'pop-top' and installed a sheet of Lexan plastic to cover the 'hole' in the
roof...I had ordered a new canvas, sliding convertible top from a shop in
Phoenix called ‘Street Beat’ to be picked up on the way through town...This
new top will replace the plastic sheet and give us that real European
look!!!...unless it leaks, in which case it will cause that ‘yur-a-peein’
effect as the rain streams in!!!

We hit Phoenix Monday afternoon about 3:30 and found our ‘slider’ supplier
to be open on the holiday, but the top wasn't done, or even started, due to
the frame still being at the paint/powder coating shop...they told us to
give em’ a call in the AM the following day to see what could be done...

We found a motel out near Tempte, next to one of those large super malls,
called  the 'Phoenix Mills'...this place was so large they had every
entrance marked with numbers and maps every 500 ft or so, and even then we
got lost!!!.. we had dinner in a place called the &quot;Rainforest Cafe&quot;,
complete
with crawling vines everywhere, and anama-tronic type jungle creatures all
over the place...

The next morning, we trekked on over to the mall again to kill time, as our
top was to be ready about 3 PM...we went to see one of those Imax shows
about Mark Twain that's in 3-D...they gave us some kind of electronic high
frequency goggles that make the 3-D effect look like you are sitting in the
middle of the 7 story screen!!!..I mean, you could almost reach out and grab
the pipe off Twain's desk, it's so real - nothing like those 3-D movies of
old...

We finally got our new ‘slider top’ at 5 PM in downtown Phoenix on Tues. Feb
16th - great, another traffic jam as everyone hit the freeways home - except
we got to use the commute lane and 'wizzed' past all those suckers sitting
there!!!...we drove all the way down to Nogales, AZ that evening and had a
great Italian dinner made by Mexicans!!!...it was really a good dinner,
though, and the wine was ‘heaven’ after the long drive...

Wed Morning at about 7:30 we ‘opened’ the Mexican auto insurance agency in
town and then got across the border by 8:15...Before leaving the US we
'tanked' up the bus in Nogales at $.899 per gallon...AZ has the lowest fuel
prices around, and their highways are really the greatest - lots better than
our Calif asphalt...

At about 21 kilometers south of the border, we hit the Mexican customs and
Immigration 'blockade'...no sweat, we had to pay $11 on a credit card for
our auto import fee, and 50 cents for a couple of Xerox’s of documents, and
that's all - they just waved us through, and brother were we glad, as we had
several boxes of stuff tied on our roof rack, as well as our luggage inside
the bus, and didn't want to unpack/repack right there on the side of the
road....

The trip from the Border to San Carlos (Guaymas area) was a nice drive in
the Mexican outback...we chugged along at our usual 60-65 mph pace, while
everything in site passed us by (as in CA &amp; AZ)...even a damn Mexican VW
bug!!!...those Mexican Hwy Buses are a real joy as they roar by at about 80
mph, when the posted speed limit is about 60 mph!!!...we arrived at our
friend’s Georgia &amp; Price Eaves beach side 'digs' later Wed afternoon...We
found them lounging on the verandah with a couple of cool drinks, waiting
for us!!!...Georgia had been fighting that nasty flu bug everyone's been
getting, but so far Price had been spared...Pat had caught the California
version of the Flu Bug a couple of weeks before we left, and has just about
got it licked, but was still taking some drugs the doctor had ‘scribed' for
her...Sat morning, Price came down with the bug and is still laid out flat,
trying to cope...So far  Ray has been spared the effects of this ‘Bug’, just
too ornery I guess ( he uses lots of Limes with his Rum &amp; Tequila drinks to
keep the Bugs away)...

Ray spent all day Thurs installing the bus’ new sliding top - what a job,
cutting', filling', cussin' most of the day, but it's now done and we
cruised down to the beach Friday, with the girls standing up through the
roof getting the wind in their faces... the weather here is 75 - ish during
the day, but it cools down to around 60+ at night, just about right for
now...Pat forgot about her ‘scribed' medication making her sensitive to the
sun and got some nasty looking welts on her arms and wrists the first day in
the sun...she's better now, but has to cover up and it's slowing down her
tan a bit...she has to make up for it by taking lots of liquids - like
Pacifico Cervesa, Rum &amp; Coke, Gin &amp; Tonic, ‘To-kill-ya’ Sunrise, etc!!!...so
far she's hanging in there...

Sat we drove over to the Port in Guaymas to check on our reservations for
the Ferry boat to Santa Rosalia over in Baja for the 24th...well, this is
indeed Mexico, as there were no reservations, and the boat now cruised on
Tue’s and Fri's...so we made a new reservation for Tuesday, 23rd, and were
told to be at the Port by 6 AM for the 9AM sailing...it costs about $150 for
the bus and we each pay an additional $13 for the trip - still quicker and
cheaper than running the asphalt all the way around!!!...

Pat is a little concerned about the open water 8 hour trip, but the weather
has been real calm down here lately and hopefully will still be good on
Tuesday...I wonder if we can drag a fishing line or two and see if we can
pick up a Marlin or Dorado on the way!!!...Price had only fished half a
dozen times this season, but will try again next week if he gets up and
around...

Pat &amp; I hit the local flea market on Sunday and scored several good
T-shirts; a cool Monty Python ‘T’, and one from a micro-brew in Napa, real
close to home...

Stay ‘tuned’ for chapter 2 of our 1999 Mexico Adventure...'The Great Mexican
Ferry Boat Adventure'

Hasta la bye, bye...Ray &amp; Pat Cellar
