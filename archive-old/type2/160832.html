Subject: When vandals strike

Woke up the morning to discover my passenger window smashed to bits.
No other damage and nothing gone from my vehicle fortunately. I'm
looking for a replacement passenger window in the Albany, NY area. Can
anyone assist me today?

I called Safelite Autoglass and they will come install a new window
for me tomorrow for the low (?) price of $355 - about twice what a new
windshield costs also installed by them.

How frustrating.

peace
