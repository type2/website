Subject: successful seats!  Finally...

Hey all,
Well, today I set out to tackle the removal and restuffing of the
passenger seat of my '78.  Repeated attempts to loosen the seat had been
extremely futile.  Today I spent literally HOURS liquid wrenching and
hammering and after about 4 hours I finally got it out.  What a bitch!!
Actually restuffing took about 15 minutes 'cause I knew what I was
doing, but I hope I never have to take one out again that is that stuck.
The tracks were a mess, with rust and old horsehair gumming up the
works.  I cleaned everything up and really really greased things up when
I reinstalled.  It's still a little gritty, but it does move.  OH, I
also found this out, to my disappointment:  Liquid Wrench does an excellent
job of dissolving the glue that holds the black rubber mats (the ones
around the seats) down.  So I'm going to need to redo those.  Anyone got
any suggestions on what type of glue to use for that?

But, now both front seats are once again comfy, and I hope that foam
lasts for a long time.

Sean
