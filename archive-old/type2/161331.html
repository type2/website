Subject: Rim Offset and Rubbing Hankooks

Hello Y'all, I recently installed some Hankook tires from Bus Depot on
my 1971 ex-Westfalia. On the right rear, the tire is rubbing on the
raised bumps / blind nuts on the inside of the fender. Has anyone else
had this problem? Do all Bay and Vanagon rims have the same offset? The
fender well is not bent in, and the tire is not rubbing on the other
side with the same raised bumps. I know there are some differences in
the rims over the years, the most obvious being the early round center
hole versus the later five point rounded hole. Is it possible I have a
Vanagon rim that is wider or with a wider offset? Thanks for your time,
Timo
