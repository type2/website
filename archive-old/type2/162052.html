http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/FindTimingMark.html

Of course this mark corresponds to 0 deg. on the scale which isn't  
much help when you don't have one unless you determine TDC by the  
engine position then put a mark on the shroud.

After that every 4 degrees is 7mm apart where the timing scale would  
be (or just above it).

&gt; how many centimeters or inches would it be
&gt; to the left of the timing knoch presuming the knotch is at twelve  
&gt; o'clock.
&gt; any tips on finding where the zero would be.

I measured the same distances as Tom. 24.5&quot; (623mm) pulley  
circumference and 7.5 BTDC would be 13mm away.

I wish VW had used another method than the plastic/metal scale. Of  
course they just relied on the TDC marker unit and timed it  
electronically.
