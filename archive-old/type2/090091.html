AARGH!!!! Bitten in the butt by my own lazieness!!!! :-)

Richard, I wrote that page at least two years ago, with the best of
intentions to go out and keep researching and keep it current...  Alas,
the best laid schemes o' mice an' dworkins gang aft agley an' lea'e us
nought but grief an' pain for promis'd joy!  I have not touched that page
since I first wrote it :-( It is *very* out of date and you use it at your
own risk.

Ray Nemo did.... and see what it got him! :-)  He asked me about updates
and I chased him into making one (evil grin).  His current tire pages
should be regarded as an update to my page, and my page should be regarded
as web-detritus. I seldom post on tire threads any more, it is just way
too religious an issue for me.  I do read about it, tho, and I will back
Ray up to the hilt!  He is doing just fine, IMNSHO, and I encourage him to
continue!

For me, I like stiff sidewalls and good load handling capability.  I am
currently running the Bridgestone RD603s on the rear and the Agilis on the
front of my vanagon Westy.  Both are over 1500 lb weights and are fine.
