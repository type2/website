Subject: Seeking a side step support

Hello All,
I have an aluminum side step, with the cast aluminum side support attachments
(what enters the jack point) and mine are cracked.
Looking for anyone in a similar situation that would have one bad as well that
is willing to part with.

Kind Regards,

Frank E Biffath III
