Subject: The VW cd

As I've been looking for something I can do to help my fellow VWers, I
hereby offer my services and storage space to begin collecting whatever
data we can for the type2 CD archive.  It may not be as complete as a
commercial one with VW support might be, but maybe someone with contacts
at VW could get them to release some stuff for us (owner's manuals?  parts
microfiches?) and we could at least throw on the type2 archives, faqs, and
the like.  Hell, we could probably make it an every-VW CD and still have
plenty of room left over. 

The one problem is that I don't have the facilities to actually write CDs.
I can set up the archive, and I can make the stuff available on tape (8mm,
9-track, 1/4&quot;, QIC) and maybe even on ZIP disks, but I don't have a way to
produce the CDs.  Anyone want to make this a cooperative effort?  I even
have access to scanning facilities if we can get people to give us
permission to reproduce things.  

Let me know what y'all think.
