Subject: Oil Cooler / 

I have a stock 77 Westy (with new passenger tires). I'm planning on 
traveling out west an in the mountains this summer with a loaded Westy. So 
I'm trying to make it roadtrip worthy.

I've read many postings on external oil coolers. And I still have not 
reached a conclusion. Should I install an auxillary oil cooler or is the 
stock external oil cooler good enough?

Also I have a good sized hole in my exhaust system (header with a cheasy 
glass-pack). The heat transfer cases are in good shape. Should I replace it 
with a $79 one piece replacement from Bus Depot (Pacesetter Extractor-Type) 
or go with more of a stock setup?

Thanks!
