&gt; OUTSIDE AIR to fill tire. unlike say,m a compression tester, and a tire

Nope, like I said on a FI bus this is not a problem, simply disconnect
the injectors power leads and the cold start leads just to be sure
and voila should be no, or at least an incredible minor amount of
fuel in the resulting mixture, I'd let some escape first to be sure.
Really seems the key to me on a fuel injected vehicle.  Carbed and
diesels are like I said SOL.
