Is it just me or do we all worry when partaking on a long trip?
I am getting ready to leave on a camping outing of about 700 mi round =
trip to Crater Lake in Oregon.  As always I did a deep inspection of the =
&quot;Magic Bus, Jenny&quot; before I left.  Upon close inspection I found a =
frayed fuel line **DANGER WILL ROBINSON**  and corrosion on positive =
battery cable.
Not a problem, fixed both issues and am ready to make my journey.=20
My question is ... do most of you go through this process and =
replace/repair what could be issues before they happen?  And do you save =
the &quot;maybe parts&quot; for replacement spares on the road?
This is a very reliable 71 Westy that has gone on several long trips =
before, but every time I seem to go through the checklist and go through =
the concerns...
And if you see me on the side of the road with the lid up, stop by....

Jeff

I think the moral of this story is for newbies... always take a good =
look at your rig before you go!
