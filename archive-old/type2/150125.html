Subject: Re: [T2] Stud, lower engine mount

Hi Stan,

I've been through exactly that with a 5 rib/2L combination. Double- 
nut the studs and crank them out with a wrench on the lower nut. It  
shouldn't be too difficult. That way you'll know the depth for  
certain. And you're going to have to pull them out eventually in  
order to replace them.

&gt; I've got to replace my 2 lower engine mount studs.  2L , dual carb  
&gt; engine (probably a 78?) mounted to a 5 ribbed tranny.  The studs on  
&gt; it are too short and have to be replaced.  I can get M10 X 85mm  
&gt; studs or 10 X 82mm studs.  The problem is I don't know how far into  
&gt; the engine case the studs screw, so I can't measure.  It looks like  
&gt; the 82mm studs will work but I don't want to order them and then  
&gt; have to get the longer ones.  Any help appreciated.
