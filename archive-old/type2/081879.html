I'll help on a Sunday, jack and tools provided, but I have never done a =
type 4.=20
=20
We could do it at Troy's or Mad Uncle Dave's if the NC guys wanna do it, =
or maybe at Boyd Smith's house if the TN Mechanized Unit wants to take =
it on.

Should be an easy 1 day job if Troy has all the CORRECT parts on hand.

problems)


  Ok, I am having second thoughts on whether I should have dropped my =
engine while at EB.  Now I am using a quart every 100 +/- miles.  Ill be =
on the freeway like I was today (taking my pregnant girl to the doctor), =
and when I stop and park there is a steady stream of oil coming from =
what looks like the seal between the tranny and engine.  I know I can't =
go on much longer like this, even if I baby it.  Being that this is my =
main vehicle, I do not want to drop this engine / engine-tranny by =
myself.  I am not sure that I could get it done in one weekend.  Plus =
never having done this before, there is so many little things that I do =
not know and would not think about.  So, I am asking the list if there =
is anyone that could help me do this engine drop.  This would have to be =
done on the weekend as I am hard pressed to get much more time off of =
work.  The bus is drivable and I can get it pretty much anywhere within =
the surrounding area of Western North Carolina.  I would have to be able =
to leave Sunday evening or eeeaaarrrrlllly Monday morning.  I have all =
the seals and parts needed as I planned on doing this at EB.  I have =
more money than I did then and could offer to pay at least something for =
services provided.  I don't care if we do at my place or a shop.  I will =
provide any food/housing/internet/etc if this was done at my place.  =
Thank you all for your great advice and help that you have provided.
