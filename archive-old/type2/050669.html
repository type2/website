I sure wish I could say the same.  This has been covered extensively in the
past  -  see the Type 2 archives.

The only reason I have _not_ switched from Bosch to NGK plugs in my 1600SP
is that a number of VW owners and technicians have told me the &quot;Japanese
metric&quot; thread profile of the NGKs often caused problems when installed in
A/C VW heads.

&gt;&gt;  I have used Bosch Supers on 15 different VW's &amp; never had a problem or
had one fail.  Just my opinion.
