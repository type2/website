&gt;I use the Permotex Aviation stuff.  I never can remember what it is exactly
&gt;called, but is comes in a short squatty jug with a brush made to the cap
&gt;(like PVC cement).  It says something about aviation on the container.

&gt;An older man who is a friend of mine and just so happened to work at a VW
&gt;dealer in the 60s and 70s as a mechanic suggested it when he helped me
&gt;rebuild my first AC engine.  On that motor, I had no leaks.  I used it on
&gt;my Westy engine as well to seal where the jugs meet the case.  I also used
&gt;the paper gaskets.

I believe it is Permatex 3D.  I use it too, and have never had leaks from
the cylinders.
