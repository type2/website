I wanted to tell the list that the KYB gas-A-just shocks DID make a
difference on my bus after all.  I hadn't noticed much of a difference
until recently when I realized that my bus no longer bottoms out in front.
It used to slam down really hard just like Tobin describes.

I am relatively new to Dallas and don't know the streets that well.
Yesterday I was driving through an unfamiliar part of town and drove
through a normal looking intersection at my standard 40 mph - except that
the far side had a huge dip in it.  I hit it so hard my front wheels came
off the ground on the recoil.  The bus didn't slam the bump stops like it
would have before, and there was no apparent damage - everything that
wasn't tied down was thrown around like a tossed salad though.  I'm really
glad I bought those KYB's now!

I am also of the opinion that bottoming out of the front suspension is what
tore all of my balljoint boots eons ago.  :(
