&gt;Greetings,
&gt;     My '72, 1700 engine is missing several exhaust studs (head to heat
&gt;exchanger).  There was a recent post about someone using the Big-Sert
&gt;inserts ( www.timesert_dot_com/bigsert.htm ).  The 8mm stud kit comes standard
&gt;with 11.7mm inserts.  If you request it, they will substitute the 16.2mm
&gt;inserts.  My question to the list:  Which length inserts should I get?  The
&gt;person that posted about using them installed the 11.7mm inserts, but thinks
&gt;the 16.2mm would work.  There is a concern that you might have to drill the
&gt;stud hole just a bit deeper to use the 16.2mm studs.  Would drilling deeper
&gt;cause any problems?

If you're talking about the length of the threaded area of the stud that screws into the head, definately go for the 16.2mm ones.  That's close to the original stud length.  I have used the shorter ones in the past but I didn't feel good about it.  You can always cut them down if you have problems.  Longer is stronger, and you need strength in this area as those studs support a lot of weight.
