Subject: Yet another question concerning pop-tops

Namely, all the descriptions of transferring a pop-top to a non-pop-top 
loaf involved welding up there.  My question is, is this welding done for 
the purposes of the bed on top?  If I had no intention of using the top 
as a bed (just would like some standing space and, to be utterly frank, 
enjoy doing things to my bus), is this topside welding still necessary?  
I know that the pop-tops had some reinforcements welded in on the under 
side.

I would like to put a pop-top on my '78, and while I can fairly easily 
get a welding associate to do work on the bottom, I don't have an 
enclosed space in which to have the top welded (or a welder I trust that 
much).  Any help would be appreciated.
