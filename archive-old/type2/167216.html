Subject: RE: Bus motor replacement

Thanks for all the emails with the pitfalls on switching my 72 to a vanagon 
FI motor. Seems to me I wouldnt be saving any money with the switch so I'll 
just wait till I can find another VW show in the Seattle area. I think there 
is one in July up north if I recall. Maybe I can get a set of used Solex 
carbs for 200-225 then. I prolly should have held off on getting back into 
VW's until I had my own garage to work on them in instead of taking up my 
parents driveway space heh. A freind of mine is building a new shop where we 
are going to be rebuilding single engine aircraft, so when that shop is 
ready I am planning on attempting a switch to a suburu powerplant heh. That 
is the idea that appeals to me most for my son's '78.
For my '72 I think I will forgo worrying about getting it running just yet, 
and just replace all my wiring and bring the brakes up to spec. I just get 
impatient because I own an awesome looking van that I wanna get out camping 
in already heh.
-Gerry
