Subject: Stereo Wiring

   Hi All.

I checked the archives to no avail.
I'm installing an older stereo that someone installed in my Jetta into my 73
Westy.
I'm confused on the speaker wires.
The power is a fused red lead and the ground is black.
There is a purple wire which i think is the hot wire for memory.
A pink wire labeled power ant. is Mar connected to a brown wire so i won't
need these in the bus.
The remaining wires are
blue
green
grey
and white.
Any ideas which order these go to the speakers?
Are these all power wires to the speakers and i have to install separate
grounds?
Or maybe they are paired to only two speakers.

Thanks for any help. I've removed a small tangle of old sterio wires from
under the dash and pulled the fuse panel out a bit for better access.
Figured i should start fresh.
