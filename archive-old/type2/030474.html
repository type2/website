Subject: Re: [VB] Wheel Bearing Grease in Hub
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.9910291831400.27419-100000_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

&gt; First a common mistake is to completely pack the entire hub cavity.  This is 
&gt; INCORRECT.  Think about it where does that grease go at high revs of your 

I see.

&gt; wheel?  The grease is flung to the outside edge from centrifugal force and 
&gt; HAS to go somewhere.  You my friend discovered where it will go.  Of course 

Exactly.  The grease goes to the bearings.  Properly installed (not
hammered in) seals do an excellent job of keeping the grease betwixt
bearings.


&gt; back to the subject at hand....you only pack the bearing itself, with a light 
&gt; coating of grease to the inside hub.  Don't believe me ask any certified 
&gt; Porsche or vw mechanic.  Sorry I am an idiot book reader also, but this is 

I dont believe you.  So i ask my Bentley reprint of the &quot;Workshop
Manual volkswagen Transporter 1963-1967&quot;

Section V-4, page 7.  Top of the page, left column.

&quot;9 - Lubricate bearings and pack brake drumhub with lithium grease of the
correct specification.  Press the grease well into the cages and between
the rollers.  The hub cap should be free of grease.&quot;

&quot;Important
Only use good quality grease.  Do not mix different brands and types of
grease.  The amount of grease required per wheel is 80g.  too much grease
can also be harmful&quot;


As a quick reference of how myuch grease 80 grams is, i'll refer to the
grease packets included with the Lobro CV boot kits.  80 grams.  (though
the Bentley for 68-84 buses says to use 90 grams...)
