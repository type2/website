Subject: Re: [T2] Pancake Virgin

Sounds like it's rebuild time.  If you've been working on T1 engines, you'll
have no problem on the T4.  Take her out, strip her down and give her a good
rebuild.  If you do it right, and give her some TLC at regular intervals,
you shouldn't have any major problems with that 1700 for a long time.

The tin on the type 4 is really the only difference in taking the engine
apart.  Of course once you get into the long block, you'll soon see why the
type 4 last's so long, it is so much more &quot;beefy&quot;.

&gt; I have been working on T1 engines for a while now. I just got my first bus
&gt; with a pancake engine in it, a 72 Deluxe with a 1700 dual carb. How in the
&gt; hell do you get to the spark plugs without taking off tin? While checking
&gt; compression I dropped both rear most plugs (#2 &amp; #4) and can't friggin get to
&gt; them, they are inside the tin!
&gt; BTW, compression was #1=60, #2 =60, #3=70, #4=95. ARe readings this low cause
