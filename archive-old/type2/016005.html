	Derek,

	Your theory is quite right. In very cold weather the air coming from the
original heating system gets colder all the time if you drive at an steady
and high speed (90 km/h ;-) ). At low engine speeds the stream of air is
not enough to transport all heat generated in the heater boxes. The heat
dissapears trough the outer sheet metal of the boxes and some is lost
during the long transport trough the tube under the bus.

The booster fan is as it´s best in city driving. You get a steady airstream
keeping the windows defrosted even while waiting for the traffic lighs to
turn green. 

Air has very low density and is therfore not very suitable to transport
heat, the faster the air is transported from the heat source to the point
of usage the better.


&lt;Someone help me understand this.
&lt;
&lt;If the heat exchangers only get so hot then how does running more 
&lt;air by them make the inside hotter.  I would think that the more 
&lt;air you draw over the exchanger fins the cooler they would get 
&lt;and therefore the air coming into the cabin area would be cooler.
&lt;
&lt;Is this right?
