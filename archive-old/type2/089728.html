&lt;&lt; For those that have recently painted their bays, what was done about the
side vents?  It's hard to get in there with a paint gun I imagine and the
fuel tank breather tubes are obstructive also.

Mask the outside and use a &quot;touch-up&quot; gun. The masking prevents getting
too much paint and runs on the outside and the touch-up gun's smaller
can allows the tip to get inside the vent...
