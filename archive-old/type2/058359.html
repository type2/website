Subject: steering box, was: coupling disc

MBH pointed out:
  While your under your Bus getting dirty you might also consider
changing the gear oil in the steering box...makes a world of
difference! 

Dear MBH,
  The much neglected steering seems to be the hot topic of the week! I
didn't know the steering box was a regular maintenance item. Makes
sense though. Is there a drain srew or something, and should I get a
replacement gasket or something? Plus, what oil did you use?
  So long,
Gregor
