Subject: Unfamiliar Oil Leak

As I mentioned several times before, I not very
schooled on the Type IV bus engine.  The one I am now
currently working on has a significant oil leak. It
lays a puddle exactly in the middle (side to side) and
rear of the engine, directly below the crank pulley. 
I cannot see where the oil is coming from because the
engine hanger bar is in the way. So, where do these
beasts tend to leak?  What are the likely suspects for
T4 oil leaks leaving a puddle where I described??

Peace, John Baker
