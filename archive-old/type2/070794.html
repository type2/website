Hey everyone I need to clear space so I have room to finish a restoration on 
a 69' beetle. So I have lots of parts for sale.

Engine tin- all kinds single port and dual port

bus glass-jalauise windows, door glass, side windows

body parts-drivers door, passenger door, sliding door, back hatch, engine lid

generators 

carbs

tables out of a 76 westy

i have many other parts also just e-mail me with your needs. I need to clear 
space and get money to finish the restoration. Make offers on parts. Thanks

dan
