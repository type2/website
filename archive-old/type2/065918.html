&gt; &gt; Sorry, John, the server bounced this out as too long and I think I'm gonna
&gt; &gt; leave it that way. This is pretty excessive. Maybe you coulc summarize it
&gt; &gt; and people could email you if they want the whole 30K shebang?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; --Ken
&gt; 
&gt; Such was the result of me trying to post the complete installation
&gt; instructions for a BA6 heater that Jack Reed had written for
&gt; FUNKENGROOVIN and that he had apparently given to Steven Johnson 
&gt; who was kind enough to post again to vanagon_at_lenti.  Unfortunately
&gt; does not look like I can post it to Type2, anyone interested can
&gt; check the vanagon_at_lenti WWW archives or I will forward the whopping
&gt; file to you.
&gt; Of course in Ken's defense he does pay for this shebang.

I will email to anyone wanting the FAQ on the BA6 heater that can't access 
it via the web and I will post it to rec.autos.makers.aircooled.vw.  Thanks 
for trying to make it easier for them John.
