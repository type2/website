 True curb feller story...

I was drivin my Bugeye one day and stopped for a light...There was a &quot;very&quot;
inebriated curb feller more-or-less standing at the curb. He lurched off and
circled my LBC, ending up at my door leaning on the windshield. 
&quot;You shouldn't be drivin' this around,&quot; he said.
&quot;Why not?&quot;
&quot;'Cause it's waaay too small. You get hurt drivin' this...What you want is a
Buick...That way you have an accident, it's like it's in another country!&quot;
