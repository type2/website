Subject: [T2] Carb options for 1700

Hey all,
Is there a carb option for the 1700 besides the stock carbs, which I heard
were very hard to keep in tune.  What about performance issues?

Also, I've heard that I need to adjust the lifters in this engine because it
hasn't ran in 3 years.  Any good web page that explains this or is this an
archive that I can search.

Thanks
Rob Blumel
