Subject: RE: 76 6-rib with 1776 in 71 Westy

I had read somewhere that if I was OK using the later model starter, then the
091 bellhousing would be OK.  In other words...

Option #1-
...to use the 1971 starter, I would need to use the 1971 002 bellhousing and
grind the input shaft down (15mm?)

Option #2-
...to use the 1976 starter, I would need to use the 1976 091 bellhousin and
would not need to grind the input shaft down.  (However, would this cause
problems with the total length...transmission + motor)

Thanks,

Michael Martin

&gt; Question:
&gt;
&gt; Is there anything special I need to be aware of in mating this 1776cc motor
to
&gt; the 6-rib tranny (from the 1976 bus)?

The 6 rib is an 091 trans
the 1776 is a type 1 engine.

to put a type 1 engine on a 091 trans.. you need the 002 bellhousing off the
trans from that year of bus it is going into.

the 091 bellhousing takes a SR87 starter.. and that starter will not engage
to the type 1 flywheel 200 mm clutch style

that is why you need the 002 bellhousing on the 091 trans so you can use the
type 1 200mm flywheel with the SR15 or the SR17 starter.

I think you need a input shaft the is about 15mm shorter... or.. you maybe
able to grind the end off the input shaft from the 091... I have 5 different
length input shafts in my tool box... I don't know which one came from what
trans,, so I am lost there.. you may have to fit the engine and see that it
wont go in the last 10mm ,, you need a little clearance, so the shaft would
have to be about 15 mm shorter.  unless you have the really long shaft,,
then it may have to be changed out.

best I can do ...
hope that helps
