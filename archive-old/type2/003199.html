Subject: etching tin

hi volks,
    sorry to bother y'all but as we all know the site is down and i must
finish my rebuild this week.
Question: What do i use to etch the tin before painting (acid of some sort)
and is this really necessary? If it's clean bare metal does it need to be
etched?
    All input is greatly appreciated

Matman........havin' fun, gettin' greasy
