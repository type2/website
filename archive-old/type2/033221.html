Subject: Air Flow Meter / ECU Question

List Members,

I have several AFMs and ECUs off of various busses.  My '82 AC van has an
AFM which works but is less than optimal (meaning I messed with it) gets
good mileage, moderate power, and fair to poor idling depending upon
engine temp. 

 I tried a meter from a '79 in it and even though it is the wrong part
number it seems to idle/run great except for a hesitation at mid-range
rpm.  I am thinking about putting the '79 ECU which matches the AFM into
my '82.  The number of pins and wires seems the same as my '82s original
ECU.  Has anyone done this / been there?  What differences are there
between the older equipment and wiring and the '82s?  Any long term
problems?  

I am in an area which does not have emission testing and
drivability-durability is of concern.  

Thanks in advance
