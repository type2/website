Subject: RE: [T2] Tires - was Discount Tires (and Snows!) for Busses

&gt; My question is that if one get &quot;C&quot; rated tires that have a
&gt; load rating that is more than  1/2 the weight at the read
&gt; axle - is that OK?


Not necessarily.  To meet bare minimum specs, the tire should either be
sidewall-reinforced, or have a C or D load rating. It should have a weight
capacity of about 1500 lbs per tire or more. And it should be capable of
inflation up to between 40-44 psi depending on the year of your bus.

This just makes it minimally acceptable.

Then there is the issue of the actual quality of the tire.  An appropriate
load rating is not an indicator of tire quality. Courney and Miles have just
told us about the tread separation occurring on multiple tires from both
Kirkland and Woo Sang (which, incidentally, is also sold as Hercules, Merit,
Signet, and Jupiter, among other names). This is at least as dangerous as
using a tire that does not meet the Bus's load requirements.

And then there is the issue of the tire's design. Unlike Hankook and
Vredestein, many load range C or D tires are simply a 14&quot; version of a tire
that was originally designed as a commercial truck tire, not a passenger
tire. They may meet specs but may not be comfortable to drive on. Some have
aggressive tread paterns, which may be useful if you're offroading in an
SUV, but can create a lot of road hum on the highway. Others are actually
too stiff, so you feel every bump in the road. And others are simply not
all-weather capable, so their suitability is limited to regions that never
get ice or snow.

This is why I opted to carry the particular tires that I chose. I chose them
based on personal experience and longstanding reputation, not just on price
(although they are cheaper than most). I have put over 100,000 miles on
Hankook tires personally, so I know they are well made and handle well. The
Vredesteins are the top rated snow tire in Germany (and one of the few snows
to meet VW Bus specs), and are commonly used on Eurovans and Volvos. Both
are designed for passenger comfort and handling, rather than simply being
truck tires. And both companies were chosen by Volkswagen to be their
original equipment tire supplier for new VW's (along with Michelin and
Continental).  So while these tires are on the lower-end of the price scale,
they are not cheap quality tires. They have a pedigree and a proven track
record that you won't get with a generic off-brand tire, regardless of its
load rating.
