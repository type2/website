Guten Tag!
    I searched the archives and found my question, but no answers. So here
it comes again. I have a 2.0 litre 77 westy and I need input on how to make
the fan shroud look great.  Is painting the way to go?  My local (and very
large) metal prep company didnt want the job...said it looked like pot metal
and the blaster would blow it apart, and degreasing it would include caustic
che    micals that would eat at it also.  Same results if it happens to be
aluminum.
    I can find no traces of paint on the shroud and my bus is VERY original,
so whats the best bet? I'm leaning toward degreasing it and painting it
black, but would love to hear a better fix.  This is the most visible part
of the engine and I want it to look great!  TIA
Jay
