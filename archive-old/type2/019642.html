One way I've had success at:

Rotate engine to top dead center and check alignment of rotor to notch on
distributor housing.  Remove the nut from the adjustment bracket to the case
stud (13 mm nut).  Pull up distributor and adjustment bracket.  Change the
o-ring. Reinstall, lining up the offset key with the distributor drive gear.
Check to see if the little spring is in the drive gear first.  This method saves
timing again.  Oil the o-ring first as a new one slips in sort of hard.

There are other ways.

&gt;   I have a two part question: First does the Dizzy have a gasket/seal to the
&gt; case? (I think I am leaking oil around the shaft of the dizzy).
&gt;
&gt; Second:
&gt;   If a seal/gasket does happen to be there, what is the sure fire way to
&gt; remove a dizzy. I have never pulled a dizzy so please make the procedure a
&gt; simple as possible.
