Subject: RE: Spiral Bound your Bently's

&gt;My wife took the manual to Kinko's and they spiral bound it with a hard
&gt;plastic spine for only $1.60.  The manual is now more useable than when it
&gt;was new because I can lay it flat and it stays down.  I've now done this to
&gt;my Haynes and may just go spiral bound slap-happy and do my whole library.
&gt;Give it a try, it's cheap to do and you'll love the results. 

My wife works in production reprograhics and did this to my Hayne's when it's
binding finally gave out after only 15 years of use and abuse and like he said,
it has made that manual a dream to use.  On the other hand, the Bentley's I have
for my splittie was so expensive and has such flimsy pages that I only it for
reference and fun reading (I even wash my hands before use), I am not even sure
if the pages could handle the binding without ripping.  I would have done this
to the Bentley's I had for my '75, but the bus gave out before the Bentley's. 
All in all a highly recommended procedure, it will make working on your dream a
dream.
