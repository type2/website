Subject: Spark plug connector boots

I was looking through an old box of spark plug wires last week and came across some silicone boots that fit the spark plug end of the ceramic connectors. The part number is 311-905-444A and ETKA shows it as an option for 2L engines.

It appears they were installed on vehicles running in damp climates. Can anyone confirm this? I'm also not sure if it was a feature of Beru wire sets or not.
