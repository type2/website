&gt; I would not recommend the Muir guide for maintaining a 79 F.I. 2.0L bus.

Sorry to say that I completely agree.  The Muir book is already hard to
use with an early 70s type 1 or 2 engine, and becomes very difficult with
a FI type 4 engine.  Certain things, like the front end and the breaks are
still good enough to justify the choice, especially if you can get it used
at a used bookstore for $5-$10, but in general, anything relating to the
engine, fuel system, transmission and other aspects as well is outdated.
Also Muir always thinks that your car is in stock condition, and so all
his advice is based on a factory correct car, which few of us have
anymore.  In particular I've always thought it unfortunate that Muir is so
quick to advocate the 009 dizzy, but never tells you how to time it out,
creating two decades of confusion (and counting).  Definitely get the
Bentley, and thank your lucky star(s) for mailing lists like this to fill
in the gaps created by time.
