I don't have the url handy but there is a scan somewhere on the web of
a VW service bulletin which talked about removing the head gaskets &amp;
making up the extra shim under the cylinder. Plus the soft metal of
the heads seals very nice against that hard cyl.

&gt; Another piece of advice is to fly cut the type 2 heads _at_ $35 each.  But I 
&gt; look at these heads and why can't I just use the $.99 head gaskets, 
&gt; properly RTV'ed onto the heads?? Won't this provide the proper seal, just 
&gt; as well as fly cutting?  ( don't fly cut - comments??)
