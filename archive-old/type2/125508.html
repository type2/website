Subject: PEACE RE:[T2] Beware of Matthew J. Ramsey

While reading this thread I was reminded that the clan of bus owners that
populated VW busses, made them so popular and enables us to obsess about
them today would want us to embrase the &quot;Bus Zen&quot;....absorb all that is good
and encouraging, let go of all that is bad and discouraging and roll down
the road to nirvana bouncing along in your bus.

Crap happens. We must move on. If we don't, when we're rehasing the crap we
miss the sunflower opening.

When you read this don't forget to sit with your legs crossed, thumbs to
index finger, and hummmmmmmmmmm.

Or do what I do...if something upsets you, put the top down on your Karmann
Ghia and drive a little. After about 30 seconds you forget you were even
upset.

Peace, Duane from Bluffton, IN...It's sunny today :-)
