Subject: Re: Vanagon self-adjusting rear brakes

If anyone in the southern Calif area wants to do this swap, there are 3 Vanagons at Pick a Part in Ontario on
Milliken Ave south of the airport. There was one stripped 78 bay, a couple of bugs, and one almost complete
70+ type 3 fastback. Nice front fenders..... right rear fender gone.
The only bus at the Monrovia Pick a Part was a stripped 72 Adventurewagon......
