Subject: Re: [T2] Blowing Oil Filter Seals

I'm not a Fram fan. Wix is my choice for quality.
Don't have any scientific data to support my choice.
Bussy is running 80-90psi at 3000 rpm and up.

Only real probs I ever had when running VW engine was
with Bosch. I tried them two separate times and both
times got leakers. Switched to Wix after having it
recommended by many &quot;real&quot; mechanics (not just
parts-changers) and have never strayed since. -BaH

  250psi &gt; oil line 
 Running a Fram HP1 Filter 
 Oil: Castrol 20-50W
  PSI Cold at idle: 50-60 psi
  PSI Hot at idle: 10-15 psi
  Max Oil Temperature 190F 
 I have been having problems with Fram HP1 oil
 filters leaking badly. The
 lines, and the filter mount have no leaks and the
 filter mounts sealing
 surface is free of cracks and imperfections. I
 recently replaced the filter
 mount just in case. The IN/OUT lines are plumbed
 correctly to the oil pump
 cover and the case return.
  The filters last only as long as the engine is cool
 and once it reaches OT  they begin to leak.
 
 I installed a Thermostat bypass and it solved the
 problem by absorbing some
 of the pressure, the down side is it made my oil
 pressure drop below 7psi
 when the engine was hot so I removed it. Id like to
 fix this once and for
 all.
  Is there a filter that has a better sealing surface?
 Is there a better  filter mount designed for high
pressures?
 
  Thanks,
