Hi Jim;

Here's an excerpt from a recent message I posted on this subject...

    &gt;&gt; Your VW owner's manual gives a specification for towed loads.

    The VW factory specifications for our 1970 Campmobile are:

            Permissible trailer weights

            Trailer without brakes                     1100 lbs.
            Trailer with brakes                          1760 lbs.

    The load rating without brakes ought to handle a lightweight tent
    trailer.

    Even our 1970 has a payload rating of 1,940 lbs.  Type 2s are actually 1
    ton trucks, and in at least one version have been used with a
trailer/bogey
    setup to haul logs or poles. &lt;&lt;

This subject has been discussed extensively in the past.  Try checking the

-----Original Message-----

&gt;  I've seen quite a few messages about pulling a trailer behind a bus, but
most folks are pulling behind a Vanagon. What about pulling behind an
earlier model. I have a '71 pop-top with a stock 1600 DP. Can I pull a
trailer behind without frying the engine??  &lt;
