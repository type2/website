&gt; I hear conflicting stories on this. Some say graphite is an abrasive, and as
&gt; such will wear on the parts. But when I was a Cub Scout leader we used
&gt; graphite exclusively as a lubricant on the car axles for our races...
&gt;
&gt; But any lube that stays wet will attract dirt.

&gt; *hopelessly confused*

No way graphite is abrasive!  It is one of the softest minerals with a
score of 1-2 on the Mohs scale.  Some think that graphite is abrasive
because they think that pencil &quot;lead&quot; is graphite.  In reality the &quot;lead&quot;
is a mixture of clay and carbon.

For years I've used a spray can of graphite in a solvent carrier given to
me by a friendly locksmith.  Works a treat in all my locks.

The only caution is with things electrical.  Graphite is a conductor.
