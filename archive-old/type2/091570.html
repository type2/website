&gt; Does anyone have a comparison of the 911 fan output in CFM vs. a doghouse fan at various rpm? I was also curious about power requirements at these comparison rpms?

To be meaningful, these comparisons need to be made with the fans mounted
on an engine.  I'm sure that the 911 fan will move a lot more air in its
&quot;free air&quot; state, but when it comes to pushing the air through the finning
I doubt that it makes much difference.
