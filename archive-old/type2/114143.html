Subject: Re: [T2] Polishing Aluminum

Finished polishing the fan. Looks GREAT! That final polishing with Tripoli 
is the key. Now eyeing a set of Porsche cookie cutters I ahve for my Beetle 
project. However I'm estimating 2.7 gizillion hours to polish them by 
hand... &lt;Grin!&gt;

There is another couple of methods I am interested in. 1 is a &quot;chrome&quot; 
powder coating. $40 for the set. Another is chemical stripping by immersing 
in a solution of nitric acid (um, not me) or possibly a solution of 
hydrogen peroxide (okay I'll use that) and applying a current, some heat, 
and an aquarium bubbler. Still learning about this. Follow that with a 
final polishing and then anodize.

Anyone heard that 400 degrees can ruin a wheel?
