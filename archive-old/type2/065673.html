Subject: Re: found leaded gas-works great!

I'm as &quot;green&quot; as the next person, but come on. It's important to know what
is dangerous, but it is just as important to know how _much_ you can &quot;get
away with&quot;. I look forward to the day that affordable zero emission
vehicles are a reasonable option, but, until then, I think I'll take my
chances. Anyway, I was jabbed with a number 2 pencil in third grade.
Doesn't that immunize me against lead poisoning or something?  ;-)

&gt;Lead poisoning doesn't affect the hair so much as what's underneath it.
&gt;Mental impairment followed by insanity, and eventual death can result.
&gt;Really, lead is bad stuff to inhale.  Of course MMT, which is used here in
&gt;CANADA as a gas additive, also has certain negative effects on health. :-(
&gt;
&gt;As far as I know 87 octane with lead is functionally the same as 87 octane
&gt;without lead, but less expensive to make.  If someone could shed some light
&gt;here, I would love to know for sure.
&gt;
&gt;All in all we would be better off using flywheel power...
&gt;Watch for a conversion before 2010.  It might just be possible to have a
&gt;zero emissions '71 Westy, and NO BATTERIES! Imagine...:-)
&gt;
&gt;Meanwhile run 'em as clean as you can and be nice to your brains.
