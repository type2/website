&gt; Regarding the rarity of sunroof buses, who knows , all the ones that I see
&gt; are caulked shut for some odd reason:)

I bought a 69 sunroof bus.  The sunroof was caulked and there was evidence of
water leakage on the headliner.  I cleaned off all of the caulk.  Pulled back
the headliner a little.  Noticed one of the drain hoses was unhooked.  Sealed
the hose, adjusted the sunroof, no leaks.
