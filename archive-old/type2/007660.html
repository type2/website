Subject: typical '78 problems?
Date: Tue, 10 Nov 1998 07:29:53 PST

I am considering buying a '78 conversion camper (don't know who did the 
lousy conversion)Are there problems with '78 buses I should be aware of? 
I have been warned about exhaust pipes specific to this year only. Any 
info is greatly appreciated. It is a 2.0 litre with hydraulic lifters 
and 80,000 miles. Thank you.
                                                  Simon
