Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Tune-up's&quot; was:Horsepower question


Tim,

Give it a break....you seem to be talking about what you get when you take
a 2001 american car in for a &quot;tune-up&quot;.  about the only thing that is
going to happen is it gets hooked up to a diagnostic machine after new
plugs are inserted.

No professional mechanic I know of offers a &quot;tuneup&quot; which includes a
compression test.  A &quot;tune-up&quot; is an American term which means you change
the plugs, put new points/condenser in, and look over the other parts and 
see if they are worn enough to try and convince some one who only wanted
spend a minimum amount of money that their car needs it.. Maybe change
the oil in the oil bath cleaner.


*Owner's* who are interested, do what you are talking about, not folks who
do mechanic work for a living.  A mechanic will listen to the car before a
tuneup is done and think about how it sounds...maybe ask/tell the owner
that it doesn't sound too good and would they want to pay for a
compression test.  Generally, most owner's would not....if it is really
getting bad, they don't want to know about it until it breaks or uses a
quart of oil every 200 miles at which time, they will trade it in on a new
car if they can possibly afford it.

If they guy says &quot;professionally&quot; tuned it generally means that he took it
to someone with a certification sign out front instead of his
neighborhood grease rack.

...sorry about the rant....

I have been in the mechanic business and *no one*
would pay me for compression test unless they knew enough about
engines to ask for one...in which case, they probably did their own
compression test.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt;Hi Jeremy,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Horsepower starts with compression. 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If the bus has been sitting that long, remove the tin and inspect the
&gt; &gt;cylinders from mouse or wasp nests. These can block airflow and the
&gt; &gt;resulting heat buildup could cause a valve seat problem, thus ending
&gt; &gt;compression &amp; power.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Also, overheating in short order can warp the rings=compression loss.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;It could also be a vacuum line, but I'd start with the compression test.
&gt; 
&gt; Even a &quot;tune-up&quot; should include a compression test.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Ok experts, here's your puzzle:
&gt; &gt;&gt; A 1973 day camper (no poptop) with recently (professionally) tuned 
&gt; 
&gt; So, what were the compression numbers?? They didn't do a compression
&gt; test???? Not professional. Indeed, if they agreed to do a &quot;tune-up&quot; they
&gt; didn't read the Bentley, that's why they are, proof posative, not a
&gt; &quot;professional&quot;. There is no &quot;tune-up&quot; procedure in the book. Only
&gt; maintenance inspection procedures show. A true professional knows the
&gt; difference. If they don't know the difference, they are not professional.
&gt; If they don't follow given procedures, they are not professional, just
&gt; wannabees. 
&gt; 
&gt; A &quot;tune-up&quot; is too many times at least a partial waste of money because
&gt; parts are replaced that don't need replacement. It's a license to waste
&gt; your money and drive up your cost per mile. Is it not a total waste to do a
&gt; &quot;tune-up&quot; if the problem is in fact just a loose vacuum hose or perforated
&gt; advance diaphram or loose hose clamp or manifold bolt or??? 
&gt; 
&gt; If you ask someone to do a &quot;tune-up&quot; on any German car and they agree to do
&gt; so, you are not talking to a professional. A professional will inform you
&gt; that he doesn't do &quot;tune-up's&quot; on German vehicles. He will ask you why you
&gt; want a &quot;tune-up&quot;, what are the symptoms and let you know that he will
&gt; diagnose the problem and fix that, then review with you your maintenance
&gt; history and followup on the currently due or over due maintenance schedule.
&gt; And if you keep the maintence schedule current, you will never again feel
&gt; need of a &quot;tune-up&quot; and you will know to keep your hand on your wallet
&gt; whenever talking to a &quot;professional&quot; who suggests you should buy a
&gt; &quot;tune-up&quot; from him. Guaranteed he will want payment for that &quot;tune-up&quot;
&gt; whether it fixes your problem or not.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Tune-up's&quot; are a panacea for unmaintained vehicles.
