&gt;Hi Doktor, and welcome back to the list.

&gt;Rather than mix and match parts and second-guess the designers, why
&gt;not go with a complete 1.7L D-jet Fi setup from a 411, 412 or 914?

Converting a carb motor with carb heads and carb cam to FI IS second guessing
the designers. That's why I advise it will be far less costly in time/money
to just pay the cost of putting it back stock.

If I wanted an FI Bus, I would buy an FI Bus. These German cars are not
Chevies or Ford's, where you have 4 or 5 different engines and 5 different
trannies all used during the same year and in the same chassis. You quite
simply cannot apply Ford thinking to German design. Totally different
attitudes and aptitudes about correct engineering. If you want an example
of US engineering in better harmony with the Deutches Method, think NASA.
Each and every part in perfected harmony with it's unique design criteria.
