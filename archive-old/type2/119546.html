Subject: [T2] door sealant warning
My Genuine German seals came today. They fit nicely.
Someone along the way tried to get the Brazilian seals to fit by using a
VERY large quantity of the black (probably) 3M sealant. So much, in
fact, that the new seals had a hard time going in. I spent well over an
hour scraping and still have not removed the giant globs of this stuff.
Not only was it a pain in the butt, but the black globs had trapped
quite a lot of moisture.
Don't do this to your bus! If you don't plan on keeping the bus, don't
subject a future owner to this torment. I have not removed all of the
gunk to my satisfaction. If anyone has some hints, please forward them.
I also replaced my tail light and turn signal lenses with the new
Brazilian dark lenses. I realize this modification will probably add
like 60 HP to the bus... They do look cool though.
