Subject: Re: Van Heater System Re-design

&gt;       For the ThermoFluids System Design class I am taking,
&gt;the design group I am in has chosen to &quot;re-design&quot; the heating
&gt;system on the VW Bus.
&gt;
&gt;       Hopefully what this means is that we will use our sub-par
&gt;heat transfer knowledge to improve the heating system by adding
&gt;insulation strategically, or fans, heatexchagners, etc.

This sounds interesting and useful!  Keep us posted on how things progress!
