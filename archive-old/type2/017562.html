Hey Volks folks

In case anyone is interested, I asked in at Bramgate (Family owned since
67) concerning my bumper paint colour question...I can't believe nobody
responded to this question...sounds like a good one for a campout trivia
contest....In any case it's L90D on bumpers from 73 to 79 other than
chrome, or orange on the 79 passenger busses like Charlie &amp; I have.

On the issue of painters and bodymen...I have a totally new respect for
those guys...after spending nearly 20 hours flat sanding what I
considered a pretty straight bus, my painter told me to go away so he
could finish it...later he pointed out about a dozen dents I had missed
that would have stuck out like a sore thumb when painted....next time,
I'll just take it to a professional, and pay him what he wants to do the
kind of job I want, in half the time I took.  Hopefully he'll remember
me when he has wiring issues (I know he hates wiring, and tune-ups).

BTW...I used Dupont Centari with a hardener/shine-agent 5 quarts worth
to get the desired coverage. L20A on the tag behind the seat called
Marigold, but the dealer called it something else, and the bus paint
page called it Chrome yellow...in any case it's nice and bright, and
hopefully it will stand out enough that people will see me coming and
GET OUT OF THE WAY...&lt;GRIN&gt;

Happy Easter all...

Den.
