Subject: Horn amperage?

Folks,

Anyone have any idea how many amps the horn pulls when running?

It's on the same 8amp circuit as the stop lights(on a 78 bus), and 
each stop light is .59 amps= 1.18amps total(for proper #1034 bulb 
installed)..

Hmmmm...so I wonder how much safety factor that VW figured in to the 
fuses.


I simply don't have a big enough ammeter to mesaure the draw....about the 
best I can do is know that it is over .5 amp.

OR!, if anyone could measure the resistance(ohms), I guess I could figure 
it out that way.....if someone happens to have one sitting right by them 
at work or something&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave
