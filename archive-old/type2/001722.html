Bill,

Thanks!  I recommend it - if anything, there's pride in a job well done, and
pride in keeping it original, if it matters.

Ironically, I never considered taking the velour-ish headliner off and
waxing away at the headliner.  Instead, I spent many a dollar and quite a
lot of sweating in the GA summer sun trying to find a way to remove the
semi-oily fingerprints I had left on it in the process of my restoration.
(Incidentally, Spot Shot (aerosol) was finally discovered to be the magical
ingredient.)  My headliner now pristine, I'll probably save the woodwork for
when next it starts to look poor.  Right now, I'm too stubborn to let my
hard work go to waste!

Perhaps ol' Joe there at BustedVW will let us know if those bloody clips are
available.  I don't believe I've seen someone from RMMW post here...

Cheers

justin:

congratulations on your panels. I'm considering the same in my 76.
have you sanded any cabinet stuff?
have you peeked at the equally nice wood underneath your headliner? I'm
planning to go &quot;no headliner&quot; so everyone can see this beautiful wood grain.
I believe I've seen those clips somewhere....RMMW? BustedVW?

Esteemed listees,

1) In lieu of buying new Baltic birch paneling, and cutting to size (w/
crossed fingers, of course), I spent the weekend pulling, sanding, staining
and coating (polycrylic) me olde panels.  They look incredible!  Considering
the relatively light demand on time and effort, I recommend this to anyone
who's tired of looking at faded panels yet unwilling to cut new wood.

2) In the process detailed ad nauseum above, I discovered that I need
several of the little black clip thingys - but don't know where to find
them/how much $$.  I tried the Depot, of course, but wasn't really sure on a
keyword - and it didn't show on the Interior page... certainly no part #.
Would someone be so kind as to forward me the details?  Also - every panel
but the back (back hatch) was three-ply birch - but the back panel was
pressboard?  What's that all about?  Is that original, or did the PO pull
one?
