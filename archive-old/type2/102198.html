&gt; They are stock OEM items and I would recommend that for a bus engine you

Actually it came OEM but a later service bulletin recomended removing
them &amp; making up the difference in deck height with spacers under the
cyls. But to do this fix you will have to remove the cylinders since I
haven't ever seen a split spacer. But depending on your decicion
either replace the gaskets &amp; retorque the heads or remove both &amp; use
the spacers to keep the CR the same.

&gt; If you remove them one side and not the other the engine will have an 
&gt; uneven compression ratio for one side versus the other side. DO NOT LET HIM 
&gt; DO THIS TO YOUR ENGINE.

very much so.
