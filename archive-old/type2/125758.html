&gt; The problem is that a galvanized bus would not be considered &quot;perfect&quot; by
&gt; the concours restoration types, as it was not original.

Don't want the bus to enter any shows with it, just for personal fun.

Also there's no way of knowing a car is galvanized unless you scrap off
some paint (a Type 2 with NO rust would be an odd thing though)
