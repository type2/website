Subject: Re: Testing Temp sensor in AFM '78 Bus

Mark:

I've got 2 AFM's that I've tested as you describe and both of them were 
somewhat out of range (high).  Yet, both seem to work just fine in my 
bus, so I've not thrown them in the trash :-).

I'm not sure of the electrical characteristics of these temp sensors and 
how sensitive they are.  If you were a degree or two high or low of &quot;room 
temperature&quot; I don't know how that would affect the resistance reading.  
But the fact that you're seeing changes in resistance to the gross 
temperature variances suggests to me that the temp sensor is working.

&gt; There is a procedure to test the FI temp sensor that is built into
&gt; the Air Flow Meter (AFM), by using an ohm meter on pins 27 &amp; 6.  It is

&gt; 
&gt; I have two AFM's that both read about 3500 ohms.  Which makes me think they
&gt; are bad :-( and I have to get a rebuilt one since the AFM temp sensor is not
&gt; &quot;user serviceable&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; But, I put one in the freezer and tested 26000 ohms, then heated it by putting it
&gt; on top of the toaster oven ;-) and got 900 ohms.. which makes me think that the
&gt; sensor isn't stuck.
&gt; 
&gt; Question:  Is it possible for the temp sensor to be bad and still give me the
&gt; range of 900 ohms to 26000 ohms.  Has anyone else tested their AFM Temp sensor
&gt; and got the factory specs?
