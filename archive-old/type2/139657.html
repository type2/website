Subject: Re: [T2] AVP Head

Richard,

Might also be a sticky lifter?...this was a solid lifter engine, right?

Had that happen before too...couple of taps with a hard rubber mallet and 
it never happened again.

I would bet that it would seat in correctly...any way you could turn the 
engine over on the bench?

Pull the rockers off and try the tap part several times...if it is a piece 
of paper or something, maybe it will comperss a little more.

Other options...pull the head off and look....

Cheers, dave

&gt; I've got a new AVP head that's leaking down 50% on 
the exhaust valve. I've got some grave concerns about install it and hoping it will fix itself.

&gt; The best suggestion I've heard so far is that the 
valve guide maybe tight and after breakin the valve will seat properly. Opinions?
