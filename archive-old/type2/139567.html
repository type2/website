Subject: Re: [T2] winterizing a bus :)

Joey,

*Never* mix wd40 and spark plugs....the wd40 will &quot;poison&quot; the 
ceramic of the spark plugs so that they start becoming conductors
at certain rpm/temperature ranges...verry difficult to trouble shoot.

Don't ask me how I know....&lt;grin&gt;...we''l I'll tell anyway...my Dad did 
this once on a chevy s10 and we spent over $250 trying to get someone to 
troubleshoot and fix it....they spent our money but never fixed it.

He and I finally went back over everything he had done to it before it 
acted up and concluded that sprakplugs were it...I went to the flaps and 
bought him new plugs, happen to mention to one ofthe &quot;older&quot; counter guys 
what was going on, and they guy told me *never* to use wd40 on plugs...for 
the reasons above.  We put new plugs in his ride and *all* problems went 
away.

Cheers, dave
