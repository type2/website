&gt; It turned fine when we rebuilt the engine...but seized up last Wednesday 
&gt; morning. We pulled the engine and still couldn't turn the crank, so we split 
&gt; the case and discovered the front-most main bearing seized solid (which is 
&gt; why I asked this question...trying to determine why it would seize after only 
&gt; 6,000 miles or so).

or maybe you didn't set your endplay correctly the first time :p

sorry, just messin'.  But I wouldn't know why it would seize up so 
quick.  May poor oil delivery?  When you rebuilt the engine, did you use 
assembly lube when you put it together?  did you put in new bearings? 
Did you have the crank ground and/or checked before reassembly w/ 
properly sized oversized bearings?  Did the original rebuild have 
anything to do with the front-end bearing which would relate to my 
previous question?
