Subject: Re: [T2] Debugging an Engine that's running Hot

If fuel pump volume does not surpass consumption, it is almost the same
instance as having float height improperly adjusted.

I have seen multiple engines in the past year that would not respond to
jetting changes, they stayed lean all the time. When the fuel presssure was
tested, it was always low even below 1 psi on the gauge. After a fuel pump
change, the pressure came up, and the engine responded to changes and even
needed to be leaned out some..

Fuel pump quality is a huge concern, since a god pump is ahrd to find, we
now set all our engines up for an electric pump, that delievers no more
than3PSI. The only 2 warranty repairs I have made in 2 years were both
because of a mechanical pump, atleast if an electric pump goes bad, the
engine does not receive damage from a flood of fuel, into the crankcase...

&gt; Would you care to explain your assertion?

&gt; &gt;An engine with a low pressure/volume pump WILL RUN LEAN!!

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Hypothesis #2:
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Fuel Pump not pushing enough fuel and the engine is running lean as a
&gt; &gt;result.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; The engine won't run lean from a bad fuel pump.  It is a more or less
&gt; &gt;&gt; binary relationship with the engine either running if there is fuel in
the
&gt; &gt;&gt; bowl or not running if there is not.  You can run with no pump at all
if
&gt; &gt;&gt; your fuel source is 1&quot; higher than the bowl of the carb.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I don't think the fuel filter being &quot;empty&quot; while the engine is
running
&gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;really indicative of anything, but everytime I look at it, I wonder...
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Is this indicative of anything?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; It is indicative of there being air trapped in the filter.  :-)  Try
&gt; &gt;&gt; priming it maybe?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I really figure the fluctuating idle means i have an idle leak
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;somewhere, but the only hose i haven't replaced (and which i should be
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;replacing this weekend) is the last 1' booster hose (between the metal
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;tubing and the brake booster itself).
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Plug it at the manifold and see if that helps.  I haven't had that much
&gt; &gt;&gt; experience diagnosing hunting idle problems but I would suspect it is
due
&gt; &gt;&gt; to variations in timing.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Do I need the vacuum gauge to be directly connected to the manifold,
&gt; &gt;in-line
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;with the brake booster hose but before the check valve (as per
schwarze
&gt; &gt;in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the archive)?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I am schwarze so I say yes!  :)  No really, it doesn't matter where you
&gt; &gt;&gt; connect it as long as it leads to the manifold.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I thought that hooking it up inline with the dizzy vacuum
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;lines would at least give me some &quot;first pass&quot; information on what is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;going on, but with readings under 5 cm3 of vacuum, either i have a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;huge leak or this isn't an effective test method.  The only other
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;place I can think of for a vacuum leak would be a carb bushing,
or...???
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't really understand your readings.  You should have somewhere
&gt; &gt;between
&gt; &gt;&gt; 12-18 in. of vacuum at the vacuum retard port (manifold) at idle with
&gt; &gt;&gt; everything hooked up.  Don't worry about vacuum advance readings
because
&gt; &gt;it
&gt; &gt;&gt; is also a function of manifold vacuum (but you shouldn't have any at
idle
&gt; &gt;&gt; OR WOT).
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Any ideas on what i'm missing here folks?  I would like to believe that
&gt; &gt;it's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;just a vacuum leak that i have somewhere, but, if it is, it's doing a
&gt; &gt;good
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;job of hiding and i'm at my wits end trying to find it.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; A trip to the chassis dyno (with wideband O2 sensor hookup) would tell
you
&gt; &gt;&gt; exactly what is going on with the engine.  Might be worth the 50 bucks
to
&gt; &gt;&gt; just take it in and have it done.  It will also tell you exactly how
much
&gt; &gt;&gt; horsepower your bus is putting down to the rear wheels, which is kinda
&gt; &gt;&gt; cool.  Mine makes 60.
