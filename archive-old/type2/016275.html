Greetings to all,

  As a resident of Minnesota, I just can't resist jumping in on this thread.  I 
get a kick out of some folks talking about it getting really cold, you know, 
below freezing.  Up here it gets -20F every winter.  Even the watercooled folks 
have plug in block heaters in their cars, not only to make them easier to start,
but the engines last longer.
   A volks aircooled engine is comprable to an airplane engine.  If I were to go
out in the cold of winter, start up my plane and take right off I wouldn't last 
long.  A slow, gradual warmup reduces the heat gradient.  That is the difference
between the hottest part and the coolest part.  Obviously the heads heat up 
first, the cyllinders, and then the oil.  You can also throw in  the exhaust 
system. A slow warmup 3-4 minutes in below freezing weather will reduce that 
heat gradient and lessen the chances of microfractures and unseated parts.
  The neat part is that with the right oil I was able to start my 6v 1200cc '65 
beetle when it was -36 F  in Moorhead MN a few years ago.  Most of my buddies 
without block heaters were grounded.  I sat until the idle came down and then a 
little longer and then off I went to classes.  Of course I froze my a** off in 
the process, but I made it to school.

Just some thoughts from the frozen north,
