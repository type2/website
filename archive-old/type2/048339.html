Subject: [T2] VDO sender placement question

Hey everybody!!
In one of the recent posts i read that the best place for the oil temp
sender is in the direct flow of the oil.  I know that there are several
different types of senders(dipstick,warning light spot,oil drain plug)
so what is the best sender in your opinions?  I also read on gene bergs
website that all of the lower priced (under 200$) guages are very bad
and inaccurate.  How far off is that claim? Thanks for any reply
