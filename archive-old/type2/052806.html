This is New York to Florida

I got the bus 'Robespierre' or 'The Reign of Terror',  non-running as part of 
a trade/sale of my 73 back in April. I replaced the P&amp;Cs and that got the 
motor working fine, then the brake servo and hose, fill line, rear bearings 
and brakes. I gored the inner circlip on the clutch fork during an 
inspection. Anyway, its the bus and though not a daily commuter, sits there 
waiting for the ocasional run. Put about 6k on it through last week around 
the NE, then decide to go see a concert in the everglades and why not take 
it? So we load it up and take off at 6am christmas morning, 0 degrees through 
brooklyn, urban tumbleweeds, Christine fast asleep in the back, fierce wind, 
bungees holding the recently transplanted pop-top flapping incessently - heat 
all plugged up as 20 year old nuclear heater boxes cause too much taint in 
the cabin, cold numb toes spreading to feet crossing the Varranzons into 
Jersey, then the dangerously narrow goethals bridge like riding the scree 
into a field of oil refineries and cesspools, then it gets a lot greener but 
still extremely nervous about Johnny Potatoes in that state as opposed to 
others due to quite specific past improprieties which still weren’t entirely 
resolved. Stop in at the clara barton rest area for a cinnebon and coffee, 
shivering in the rest area, congregating
near the door a few extra seconds before exiting and the inevitable well no 
the sun was coming up now and it was some relief and you kind of work 
yourself into it, believing it was worth it and what of the bus?
Well it was humming along under loud and strong and good. Wait a minute, at 
the rest area a little oil leaking from the right heater box. This is where I 
had just changed a set of gaskets, valve cover and spring because I suspected 
it to be weak. Checked the oil it was good, kept going. Through Maryland and 
then the beltway around washington saw cold and quiet no traffic on 95, Over 
the bridge into Virginia sends a chill up your spine onto the 295 connector 
around Richmond as the sun was setting into north carolina, getting tired and 
dark and still cold anyway more stopping and getting gas, checking oil, whoa 
alot more oil around the heater box checking oil and down to the bottom line 
no good find someplace further down to sleep meantime I put in some to bring 
the level up, started her right up still running fine after 475 miles. Got 
back on the highway and did another 25 miles when I look down as see we’d 
come 500 miles and it was time to quit and the motor did! a looser and 
janglier pitch to the motor, still running at 55, accompanied by the red 
light and now slowing looking past christine at the exit ramp and the words 
Sleep Inn in big letters as I pulled over I magically entered the off ramp 
for I wasn’t going to make the slight incline, I let the clutch out gives a 
burst of power , the light goes out, after a couple second I let off the gas 
and in of the clutch and the oil light comes right back on, rolling now with 
no power I turn into the hotel, 
down the line a ways and into a spot.
