Subject: RE: [VB] VWofA hassle; new aftermarket crankshaft pulley

I have the oversize crank pully in stock, 45 dollars. I haven't tried one
yet and cannot see how it would clear the tin. Makes a good disply on my
parts wall for walk in customers.

ronnie

ps. I will install one on a rock crawler buggy with RGB's to speed the fan
up at lower crawling RPM's

I have been trying to find one these to try it out.  Looks like it will 
work.
