Hm, I just use general purpose red grease ... a little dollop applied 
with an eyeglass screwdriver.  That's what I've used ever since I can 
remember (it's what my dad used on all of his cars, etc.)

Does it really make a huge difference to use specialized point grease??

(Well, I hope to never use ANY grease in there ever again, once I get 
my Pertronix installed... but until then... :-)
