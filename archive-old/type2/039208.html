Subject: VW Westy for sale in NE Ga.

Listers,

I read the post about the gentleman looking for a Westy in NE Georgia.
There is a '76 for sale at www.traderonline_dot_com in the RV for sale
section for $ 1,500.00. Looks a little rough but states it runs strong.
Just FYI.

Kenny
'77 Westy aka Grasshopper
