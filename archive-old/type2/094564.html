I have a question for you:
Are you the Don Miller who wrote Prayer and The Art of Volkswagen Mainten=
ance? (a great book, BTW...All Bus owners would enjoy it, since it deals =
with the cross country adventures of a 1971 Bus...)
TJ, who thinks that the new bus would be okay if had Round Headlights and=
 doors before the wheels...
