Subject: High Country Bus Fest AERIAL Photos

Hey Volks:   just wanted to pass along the good news.

I have booked an aerial photographer to do a fly over at HCBF and shoot a 
bunch of pics this year.  Weather permitting the plane will be flying over 
around 2pm on Saturday.

I will try to get us organized to spell out a VW logo or something with 
people, that would look really cool from the air.

Once HCBF is over, the files will be made available for those who would like 
to order a nice 8x10 glossy.

see you all in a few weeks,
Buddah

thanks again,
buddah
