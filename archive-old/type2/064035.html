You're quite right Pat. I missed a zero when converting from calories 
to kcal.'s. The correct number should be 3.97. So the list goes:
From:             To:              Do:
kW (kW/hr)        BTU (BTU/hr)     multiply by 3413
kcal (kcal/hr)    BTU (BTU/hr)     multiply by 3.97
Liters            Gallons          multiply by 0.264
km (km/hr)        Miles (Miles/hr) multiply by 0.62
Miles (Miles/hr)  km (km/hr)       multiply by 1.61
L/100km           Miles/Gal        divide 235 by L/100km
Miles/Gal         L/100km          divide 235 by Miles/Gal
&gt; Thanks for the conversion factors but the kcal/hr still doesn't
&gt; &quot;feel&quot; right.  If we multiply 4000x0.397 we get 1588 BTUs (or is it
&gt; BTU/hr?) which seems AWFULLY low for the max. output of a heater. Oh
&gt; well, one of the mysteries of life.  :-)
