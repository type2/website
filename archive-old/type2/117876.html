Subject: Re: [T2] vw mechanic's rates

not to rain on anyones parade but, i think the original poster said that
this was a side business affair.  that said, i found the point about the
insurance interesting.  my general impression is that if its going to be a
side business just register as a limited liability corp and keep all the
expensive assests in your personal name.  you know kind of like roofers do
makes it really easy to get out of jams because you have limited liability
protection and the company can just hand over its assests (phone, desk,
pad of paper) and declare bankruptcy.  i'm sure i am over simplifying this
as i am not a business lawyer.

this is not a proposal to do sub-par work and walk away from ones own
mistakes but, a suggestion about how an individual could start a side
business with out as much of the overhead as previously recommended.
