Subject: RE: [T2] Bus depot website

&gt; Does anyone know what happened to The Bus Depot's Website. I've been to
&gt; www.busdepot_dot_com and get an error saying that the page cannot be found.
&gt; I am looking for sites that sell bus parts as I am soon to be looking for


Thanks for the heads-up. I just left a message with our hosting provider. It
would seem their whole server is down, as their own website is down too.
Usually they're really good at fixing outages quickly, so I'd bet that it
will be back up in no time.
