	Jim: Have you checked the cold start  valve?
	This is a fifth injector on the air distributor
	box ( the black bagpipe looking tin bladder thingee
	on  top of the center of the engine. It is controlled
	by the thermo time switch, and only operates
	for 10 or so seconds on a cold engine 
	(its the choke on a FI engine;-)

&gt; 
&gt; I'm having starting problems with my 75 bus with a 79
&gt; fuel injected engine.  It always takes a few tries
&gt; before it will actually start and run.  Here's what
&gt; happens:  turn the key, engine cranks and starts and
&gt; runs for 3 to 5 seconds, then stops..  Do it again-
&gt; same result. Again, and it runs for  3 to 5 seconds.  
&gt; Finally, the 4th attempt results in a running engine. 
&gt; If it is warm outside, it may continue running after 3
&gt; attempts.  If the engine is warm, it will restart and
&gt; run on the first try.
