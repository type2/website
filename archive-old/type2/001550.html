&gt; &gt; some bushing between the steering column and the gearbox is damaged.
&gt; &gt; the master cylinder (that i just replaced with a remanuf. one) is
leaking
&gt; &gt; somewhere.
&gt;
&gt; WRT the steering couplers.
&gt; Pulling the steering out of a 68 a few weeks back I did my best to break
&gt; it loose from a cracked ancient coupler. It took shears and determination.
&gt; Those things have braided wire molded inside.
&gt; I have never cut apart an aftermarket one but hopefully they have the wire
&gt; as well. Which brimgs me to the thought.
&gt; I have read posts in the past where people say that they lost all steering
&gt; and others who warn of the exreme hazard of the coupler breaking through.
&gt; I have to say &quot;no way&quot; not with this thing. It could have cracked and
&gt; caused a lot of play in the steering but I cant believe it could come
&gt; apart enough to affect the steering more than 1/4 to 1/3 (im just pulling
&gt; thoughts out of the air here). Which brings me back to the Q about has
&gt; anyone ever cut open an aftermarket coupler.??

The only aftrermarket ones I've seen are made in Mexico they appear to have
only fiber in them * like a tire tread type of material* , and not wire. But
I haven't cut one apart yet.
