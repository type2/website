Subject: Re: [T2] How many different A/C units were available for the 
  type 2?

Dave, some interesting info, going on memory do you recall if the rear mount
system was offered as a stand alone option, or was a rear unit just used in
combo with a front one?

Anyone know if there are currently any websites devoted to bus A/C or a good
A/C section on one of the sites with pictures and what not of what AC was/
is available for the type 2?

I hate to take on a project but I never see info about Type 2 A/C in any one
place, I just come across bits and pieces of info and pics here and there.
Perhaps I could start to get some basic archival info together about the AC
systems and some pictures, put it up on a website, ask other to contribute
pictures and info they have see where it goes... just a place to archive AC
info, VW, after market, whatever...

I don't own a bus at the moment let alone one with a AC system in it to
tinker with, so I wouldnt be much help as far as first hand knowledge goes.
