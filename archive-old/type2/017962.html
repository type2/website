&gt;
&gt; yeah thats what i figured on too, but a good foot on the sides? even if you
&gt; added 6 inches to each side you prolly get 3-5 more extra gallons.even if you
&gt; left the sides and just added another tank in front of this one, you can
&gt; double your fuel capacity. considering the room on the flatbed and the room
&gt; inside the crew area, who cares about lost space under the crew bench. i'd
&gt; take the extra fuel capacity.
&gt;
&gt;

I will be making up a tank in the next few weeks that fills that space in my '60
double cab.  The design is such that it will slide in still leaving 6+&quot; on each
side.  Don't think the extra space  had anything to do with crash protection
(remember this was the 60's) just it was the standard tank placed in the area
that they had available.  The tank is kind of a polygon shape when looked at from
the side and ends up being about 26-27 gallons.  I'll know for sure once its
build.  I'm trying to decide where to locate the fuel pump and making sure that
there is access to it and then its building time.

And to preempt any requests, sorry, I will only be building one tank.  For some
reason, lawyers like to chase gas tanks.

I will post building results on my web page once its done.  Then I'll just have
to figure out how I can afford to fill the darn thing up.
