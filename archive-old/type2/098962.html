Subject: Head Cylinder Temp Probes?

I know this has probably been addressed before, but is there a way to install
a CHT probe without putting it under the spark plug. I ruined my first one
that way. Also, does anyone know the calibration, ie type K (Chromel/Alumel)?
Seems like one could drill a small hole, say 1/16&quot; and insert a commercial
probe and retain it with a small clamp and a bit of thermal goo for good heat
transfer. Just a thought. By the way, I'm refering to an upright dual port.
Thanks .
Tim
