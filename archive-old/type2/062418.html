As with all lubricants, tranny oil wears out. While some manufacturers 
do not state a recommended change interval, and others do not offer 
convenient drain plugs, tranny &amp; rear end oils need to be refreshed from 
time to time. How often is a matter of opinion, but I believe oils 
should be changed after 500 miles when in a new or rebuilt tranny, 
repeated every 25K afterwards. 

In an engine, oil is subjected to rigors that require it to be changed 
more frequently. Here it is not only required to lubricate, but also to 
cool friction surfaces. It is subjected to dirt, blowby, moisture 
accumlation, and shearing. The impurities are only partially removed by 
any filtering system, and the rest remain. Shearing forces tend to 
&quot;grind&quot; the oil, and high engine temperatures stress it, until its 
effective viscosity, and its ability to lubricate, are impared. 

In a gear box, the forces at work are somewhat different. Here the 
enemies are moisture and shearing forces, for the most part, as well as 
a wide variation in internal temperatures, and metal impurities 
released as gears and bearings wear. As the gear box repeatedly heats, 
air escapes through the vent tube, and a small amount of moisture is 
draw back in as the internal temps cool. The lube forms a protective 
surface on bearings and gears. As these surfaces mesh, the lube is 
sheared, reducing its lubricating value. The worn oil, combined with 
minute particles of metal, not only loses some of its effectiveness as a 
lubricant, but also tends to form a mild abrasive. 

Changing this oil is not a particularly pleasant experience because 
Hypoid gear oil smells funny, and is particularly messy when spilled. 
Not only this, but VW, like most manufacturers, placed the filler plug 
where it's not particularly easy to reach, so this job is most likely 
left to the MinuteLubes, and such. I would recommend everyone change 
their own oil, however. It's a good way to learn about the condition of 
your vehicle. If your tranny suddenly needs a couple ounces of oil 
added, the average service department won't make a big deal of it. In 
reality, it should send up a red flag. In my car, the tranny dropped 2 
ounces of lube in 2500 miles (between engine oil changes). This alerted 
me to the real problem, a leaking seal. On the same make of car, the 
neighbor had a sudden tranny failure, and a bill for $1500. He blamed a 
faulty tranny design, but when we looked at his Quick Lube bills, it had 
been leaking lube for the last 3 oil changes, and the seal probably was 
the culprit.

At each oil change, pull the drain plug and top off the tranny. An 
inexpensive lube pump (about $6) and a short length of tubing will allow 
the tranny to be topped off. When lube trickles out of the hole, the 
tranny is full. A pump (about 1 ounce) of lube should be the most 
needed, and none if all the tranny seals are functioning 100%.

Changing the lube in both our vehicles, my pump failed, so I devised a 
simpler method. Taking 10 foot of clear tubing, I emptied a quart 
bottle of lube, cut out the bottom, and snipped off the nipple. The 
tube was slipped over the nipple, and the bottle suspended about 4 foot 
off the ground (a length of string, tied to a support). With the hose 
inserted into the tranny, and a hemostat to clip off the tube, it 
looked like an IV. Now, while servicing the rest of the vehicle, the oil 
ran slowly into the tranny. With a drip pan under the tranny, it was 
just a matter of topping off the IV bottle occasionally, and gravity did 
the rest. When lube tricked down the side of the tranny, I clamped the 
line off, put in the plug, and pulled in the next vehicle.
