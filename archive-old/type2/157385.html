Subject: Re: [T2] Access to main heat tube.

There are sections of &quot;hose&quot; that connect the main
tube at each junction. The hoses are probably the only
parts that are good, but it may be that the only
reasonable way to remove them is by destroying them. I
removed the Wyes and valves and everything, but that's
only cuz I'm not using it anymore. I found that the
entire top of the tube was missing! The insulation was
all that was ducting the heat. Just be ready for
anything and expect to not have it back together same
day.

Pick a cool day and wear full coveralls and either
tight fitting goggles or a full face shield. Stuff is
gonna be falling all over you! I found some high heat
ducting flexible tubing at Aircraft Spruce. The dryer
vent tubing is a viable idea too. -BaH

&gt; Ok, I'm with Dave on this one, I look under there
&gt; and see some kind of 
&gt; wrapped giant pipe running down the middle of my
&gt; van. I know you've 
&gt; disassembled this, so how about a howto and starting
&gt; from scratch. I like 
&gt; the info you provided after the part about
&gt; discarding everything, but 
&gt; perhaps you could tell me what I'm going to find
&gt; when I start hacking up 
&gt; that padded pipe ??
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Courtney (who hates unwrapping the unknown) :-)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  Can anybody tell me how?
