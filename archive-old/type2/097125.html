Subject: Follow-up to:  &quot;Oooops ... what am I looking at here?&quot;

Some on the list may recall that five weeks or so ago my bus lost power and
died on a hill. When it crawled to a halt it was belching blue smoke and
running on #s 1 &amp; #2 only.

I trailered her back and ran a compression check. It showed none at all on
#4 and only 60 lbs on #3. I pulled the valve cover to look for problems and
discovered the head nuts were only finger tight. I retorqued them, adjusted
the valves and took another reading: 125 on #3 but still nothing on #4.

Pulling the engine revealed the #4 piston had a hole in big enough to stick
a pencil in, #3 had slight scorching,  #s1 &amp; 2 were fine. All valves were
OK.

I've racked my brain trying to understand what happened, and the best I've
come up with is this: The head not being torqued down, hot gas escaped
during combustion between the cylinder and head, causing a hot spot that
gradually brought a portion of the cylinder wall to a fieryglow, too hot for
aluminum, and so the meltdown.

I am vaguely curious to know who did the last rebuild, but not enough to
contact the PO.

Cheers,

John Rogers
