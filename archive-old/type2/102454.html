Subject: Re:westy top

Rob asked   ...&quot;Has anyone out there successfully painted their pop
top? &quot;...

When I painted the fiberglass luggage rack on our bus I used paint
from a marine supply store.  It's a single part, polyurethane paint.
It dries to a nice gloss, is made to go on fiberglass, and is meant
for outdoor service.  It dries slow which allows brush and roller
marks to &quot;flow&quot; out of the paint if you can't spray it.
