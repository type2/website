&lt;&lt;I planned to have the seat in my '60 single cab recovered but instead 
found a good one from a '59.  The tattered but recoverable seat and 
back are going in the dumper next week unless somebody wants it - for 
free. FOB my place in Alhambra, CA.&gt;&gt;

Please find a good home for it, I believe they stopped making these a
while back :)

Thanks,

Brian.
