Hi All,
   A recent post, talking about brakes said  &quot; ...  It gets very hot
in the brake area and it is too hot for nylocks. &quot;

   Just a note to let you all know that there are hi-temperature nylocks and 
also all metal locking nuts.  We use them all the time in aviation.  I don't 
think you'll find them at the hardware store or your local FLAPS.  I like 
the pin and clip better myself anyway.
