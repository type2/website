Subject: ANOTHER tool wanted to borrow - borescope!

ok, i need to look insde this damn motor and see if something is 
hitting, or a lifter is wonky, or what, and i'd like to see if i can 
do it WITHOUT tearing the motor down (untill I HAVE to :P).

austin is a podunk town w/ no industrial base, and so NOONE sells, 
rents or uses borescopes here, amazingly enough.
well, one hotrod shop could order a small one for $250, and one tool 
shop could sell me one for $2000...3 weeks from now.

a flexible borescope would be nice, but i could make do w/ a regular one.
i'd be happy to pay replacement cost up front, and get a refund minus 
fees later.

i'm posting a LOOONG list of items tried to quiet the clanky 
valvetrain later......
