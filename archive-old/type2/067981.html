Brett:
I bought a Lincoln Weld-Pac 100 about four months ago. Very, very handy tool 
to have around. So far, I've used it to patch my cargo floor and various 
holes in the body of my bus, as well as re-welding the torsion leaves in the 
front suspension (which were all loose because the weld on both the upper 
and lower stacks were broken). Cost:
Welder: $299 on sale
MIG kit (highly recommended): $125
80 CF bottle to hold argon/co2 mixture: $80
Cost to fill bottle: $17
It's an expensive tool, but if you've ever priced bodywork, you know you can 
very quickly recoup your investment. I would say that the cargo floor work 
alone would have cost more than $1,000 if I'd farmed it out.

I am considering getting a welder for x-mas and would like to know what
the best kind to get is.  I have no real experiance with one and would
probably not use it all that often.  Anyone outthere buy one lately and
like it (or hate it).  Any good brands to look for?
Initial cost plus cost to maintain the welder would be interesting to me.
So what kind of welder should I buy to work on my Bus (there, bus stuff
included) as well as other things?
Also saftey is pretty important as well as ease of opperation.
