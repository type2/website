Subject: Re: [T2] RE:68-73 Westy Closet/Cabinet mods.

Jay, your cabinet looks really nice, maybe you could talk your dad into
building a head ache cabinet for the back, those things are great for
bedding storage and/or linen.  And if you design it like a Vanagon, you have
extra storage inside the rear hatch, a really neat idea from westy.

&gt;&gt; Adam wants to cut the top off of the closet/cupboard unit in his westy
&gt; and
&gt; shorten it down enough so that it won't block the passenger side rear
&gt; window. &lt;
&gt;&gt; Anybody seen or done this before? It seems like a good idea to me since it
&gt; avoids the expensive issue of re-upholsering the Z-bed and finding spacer
&gt; cushions for the gaps in the rear deck.  &lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Greg,
&gt; 
&gt; I decided to do this exact same conversion in my bus, but instead of
&gt; cutting down the original cabinet in my bus (which was still in pretty
&gt; decent shape), I fabricated a new shorter cabinet from 1/2&quot; Baltic Birch
&gt; plywood.  By using the old cabinet as a template (and with my dad's
&gt; carpentry skills) I was able to get the whole cabinet out of one 5'x5' sheet
&gt; with some left over for new projects.  I decided to go for access from the
&gt; top instead of the front, but it could work well either way.  You can see
&gt; how it came out here:  http://www.geocities_dot_com/vwcamper72 .  If you need
&gt; more pictures or details, let me know.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps.
