&gt; Anyone out there have an accurate wiring diagram for a mid-'70's
Westfalia?
&gt; I have a bundle of wires (and a relay) on the left side of my '75
&gt; Westfalia's engine compartment, but I don't know what wires should have
gone
&gt; to the FI that vanished years ago and which go to the camper gear.  I'd
&gt; really like my fridge and sink to operate when I'm not plugged in to shore
&gt; power.  I'd gladly accept scanned or faxed info if it's available

What I really mean is a diagram specifically for the Westfalia equipment!  I
already have the Bentley manual and another wiring diagram from some books
at the library that have wiring diagrams for just about every car ever
driven.  It's the camper gear wiring info I need.  Thanks for the extra
bandwidth...
