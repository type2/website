Ok, I'm unable to make any sense of the wiring diagram available on type2_dot_com
so i'll ask for some advice.

I have 4 wires coming out of a black wiring harness (tube?) in the
engine compartment of my '71 campervan.  a brown wire (not connected)
a brown wire with a green stripe (not connected), a black wire (connected
to the coil), and a striped green wire connected to the oil sensor.

any ideas as to what the other two wires should attach to?

thanks,
	t
