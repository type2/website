&gt; To get an accurate vacuum reading, you ned to find a port that leads into

yeah, i guess i thought i could figure out if there was vacuum
being created at half and full throttle, thinking that low or
unsteady readings would be indicative of something -- a vacuum leak
at the throttle bushing maybe?  

After doing this, I realized that if the dizzy was advancing properly,
I did in fact have vacuum at the vacuum advance port, but that was
only a qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, assessment.  

*shrug*

But yeah, it took me a minute to realize that the gauge needed to be
hooked up to the manifold port to get a reading, although I still don't
think I've found that port.  :)

&gt; If you had that big of a vacuum leak, the engine wouldn't even come close

true, true.

&gt; If you're not getting any vacuum at idle, you're probably
&gt; connected to the carb (which would be used for vacuum advance), not the
&gt; manifold vacuum.  Somewhere, you should be able to get a reading for
&gt; manifold vacuum if the engine is idling.

hmm.  Well, that's an interesting thought.  I'm pretty sure that I'm 
connected to the manifold vacuum port of my carb, but let me describe 
where I've got it connected.

The H30/31 Carb has, AFAICT, 4 vacuum ports.  If we're looking at the
carb from the rear (RIR, you're standing behind the bus looking at
the engine compartment), you see:

a)  1 vacuum port coming out the left side of the carb, just in front of
	the throttle lever

b)  2 vacuum ports (capped) adjacent to each other (on the same horiz. plane)
	at the throttle bushing level (ish).  These face the rear of the bus.
 
c)  1 vacuum port that is a pipe pointing down at a ~60deg angle into the base
	of the carb.  This faces the rear of the bus and is below the (b) ports.

I have my advance hose connected to (a) and my retard hose connected to (c).

I made the assumption that (c) went to the manifold because of it's location
and because http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electrip/dvh.htm seemed to point
to this being the right port.

how'd i do?

List of things to check tonight:

- place finger over manifold port of carb to do a qualitative check for vacuum:
	my finger should stick to the port a wee bit, right?

- reconnect gauge to port i have confirmed is the manifold port of the carb w/o
	the t-connector (so the retard port of my dizzy can isn't attached to
	anything) -- confirm that I have a vacuum reading.  If I felt my finger
	stick but I have no reading, then maybe I got a bum gauge (teach me to
	spend $18 instead of more!)

- no vacuum reading?  seal off brake booster manifold port and check again.  if
	i get vacuum after this, i know that 1' of booster hose i didn't replace
	yet is bad and perhaps the source of my probs.  

- if i get a vacuum reading with just the gauge attached to the carb (not the
	dizzy), attach the dizzy again using the t-connector:  i should get the
	same reading

- with gauge and dizzy connected to carb's manifold vacuum port, seal off brake
	booster manifold port and see if reading changes.  If so, i still could
	have a problem either with my booster or with that last foot of booster
	hose.


doh, or as steve just wrote, i could hook up my gauge (and dizzy) to the vacuum
port on my intake manifold that i've got capped.  maybe i should do that anyay.
