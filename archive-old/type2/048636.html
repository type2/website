Subject: [T2] Engine re-build

Hi guys, thanks to everyone who answered my Q's on engine cases. I now have
1776cc saloon case for sale _at_ cost of machining work (good) if your in the
UK.

Terry's are fine with a refund, but they've been soooooo good thus far I
would rather stomach that cost myself &amp; they are fine with getting a case
some time. Anyway this is the spec I plan, some of the parts I have already
purchased (marked with &quot;*&quot;).

Upright engine,1776cc

69mm welded counter weighted crank, 8 pinned.
Engle 110 cam. *
Scat solid lifters. *
Larger (but not too big) meling oil pump. *
Full flow cooler/filter system with thermostat (* have filter plate, pump
plate &amp; thermostat (80 deg).
Heavy duty gland nut &amp; big washer. *
Stock con rods, lightened &amp; end balanced.*
Single quiet pack &amp; extractor.
J tubes instead of exchangers.
Twin single carbs.
009 * (don't start that F.A.R.T!!)

any tips or other advice is cool
