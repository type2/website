&gt; What's the story here, List?  Does somebody really have to get a
wrench back
&gt; there behind the shroud?  Or do the bolts just come out from the
starter
&gt; side?
&gt;

Do yourself  a huge favor and go buy a 17mm Gearwrench from one of your
more
well stocked FLAPS, I got mine at NAPA (I paid about $8 for mine).  This
is
basically a
box/open end wrench, except that on the closed end it has a ratchet
device
built into it.  It has an extremely low profile and will fit in places a

regular ratchet wouldn't think of going, although FWIW I have gotten a
ratchet
back there before.  You can buy the gearwrenches in sets, but I'm told
that the
quality is better on the individual pieces.  I've bought the 10 and 13
mm sizes
as well.

The top starter bolt has a &quot;D&quot; shaped head, the flat side of the &quot;D&quot;
fits
againist the starter body, allowing it to be tightened/loosened without
having
to have a wrench on the head.  However as the nut is loosened, try not
to exert
any pressure on the bolt in the direction of the front of the bus, as
the nut
gets to the end of the bolt I have had the head push forward and slip
the flat
edge of the &quot;D&quot; off the case of the starter, allowing it to turn freely.

Usually if this happens, the nut is at point that you can reach back
there with
your hand and turn the nut off without a wrench while pulling back on
the bolt.

Unless you have a huge head :-), you should be able to remove the air
filter
snorkle and look back behind the engine to see what you're dealing with
before
sticking the wrench back there.  It's really not to bad.

Now the other top engine bolt, that's the one I really cuss......

Good luck,
