Hi Folks, I have one that came off a '71, hauled
plenty of bugs with it, great unit to have, mounts to
rear frame, remove your bumber (2 - 17mm bolts each
side) there is also a 3rd bolt hole which would be
best to clean out with a 10mm 1.0 tap, if interested I
am in Maryland, also have several tons of parts,
engines trans iceboxes interior doors sheet metal lots
of 2.0 Liter engines call me direct 410-551-4892
Klaus
