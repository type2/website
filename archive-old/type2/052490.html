Subject: [T2] Window a/c on a bus?

Could anyone tell me where I might find info on installing/using a
household window a/c unit on a bus?  I saw an article awhile back in one 
of the magazines about a bus gathering and they commented about a group
from a particular club who were quite adept at doing this.  They built
some sort of bracket/mount and hung the unit through one of the front
door windows.  Air conditioning is a must for summer camping here in
Texas.
Any info would be appreciated.
