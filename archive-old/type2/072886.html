Subject: brake woes
Message-Id: &lt;v02130501b439591d134c_at_[209.245.213.176]&gt;

As the 70 nears its 30th birthday (born 10/29/69), I've been fixing things
up that I've let slip... and found that what was no LONGER slipping was the
left front disk (converted to 72 running gear). It was locking and not
releasing when I let up off the brake pedal. Would slowly release as the
wheel rolled.

I have rebuilt both calipers, rebuilt the m/c, fer the hell of it replaced
the brake line again - no go. Even shortened the pushrod a smidge.

So what now? Do I start all over again?
What I am looking for is a way to test the individual m/c circuits, each
caliper, etc with nothing more than my vacuum pump. I have no helpers, so
oneman tests are the best.............
