&gt; I notice it looks like the rear end of my bus is sagging, can't seem
to
&gt; locate the reason, what am I missing?

Sure that the PO didn't leave a bag of cement in the back?

Nope?  Well then make a of check before you assume the rear is sagging.

Find a level surface on which to park the bus (_really_ level!)

Park the bus on the surface, put the bus in gear, and don't set the
parking brake.  Put a driver in the driver's seat and then put a level
on the load floor (on the sliding door's sill) pointing fore and aft. 
If the level shows level, then the rear suspension is OK.

BTW, you can't see the horizon in the inside rear view mirror of a
correctly-set bus.  The top of the rear window blocks it.  When I
bought my bus I thought that it was sagging and ended up haveing to
adjust it twice (and probably back to the original setting!)  Be
careful not to set it too high, as this will cause handling, tire, CV,
and CV boot problems.  It is better to be a bit too low than a bit too
high in the back.

If the bus is indeed sagging, check the Bentley manual for the
procedure to reset the torsion bars.  Also check the type2_dot_com
archives for hundreds of handy hints on how to do (and not do) the job.

&gt; How do I improve the horsepower and performance of the 2000 engine, 

What?  that thing's a screamer compared to the 1600DP in my '71!  Just
borrow a stock splitty and drive it for a few weeks and your bus will
feel like a rocket!

If you persist in your lust for power, get in touch with Mark
Stephens, who is generally thought of as a typ 4 specialist.  Be sure
that your Visa card is up to the task.  Speed costs money, how fast do
you want to spend?
