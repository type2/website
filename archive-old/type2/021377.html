A hydraulic lifter will function whether you turn the adjustor in 1/2
turn or 3 turns after touching the valve end,  as long as the piston is
somewhere within its bottoming out or hitting the snap ring.  Ideally it
should be in the center of its travel and thus can accomodate a
lessening of the valve lash as well as any increase.  That's the purpose
of a hydraulic lifter- it can accomodate changes in engine dimensions
due to temperature, wear over a limit plus or minus its setting within
its limits of travel  In a horizontally opposed vw engine it's presumed
valve lash decreases as the engine gets hot, and thus must be set looser
cold.  Also, valve lash is presumed to decrease over engine life, as the
valve pounds into the head.  Thus setting the lifter as small as one can
get away with initially assures a longer run before the piston in the
lifter gets too low to bottoming out.  MB
