Subject: Getting to the head bolts

I've just figured out that I did not properly torque my engine's upper
head bolts when I had it out. This due probably because I need to
tighten the bolts on my own head next time I pick up a wrench.

Now that the engine is back in the Wonderbus (1971 w/ 1776 (1600)
doghouse style engine) I really don't want to pull it again to do eight
bolts. I wonder if anyone can tell me if it is possible to get the upper
cylinder tin off without pulling the engine, or if I just need to roll
up my sleeves and do what a man's gotta do.
