Subject: Fun of sudden failures (not quite Friday material)

And don't forget (it happened to me in the 71 Westy in Philly) the fun
of your swing lever bushing housing suddenly separating from the front
beam because it rotted thru and gave when you hit that pothole- instant
30 degrees of free steering play!  Repaired it in situ by getting some
1/8&quot; X 1&quot; steel from the hardware store and TORCH welding it over each
side of the housing and on around onto the beam surface.  Can you spell
flaming grease dripping down on you?

&gt; Hmm, maybe the brake pedal going suddenly to the floor or the flexible
&gt; steering coupler suddenly breaking!
&gt; You're having a really bad day if all three happen at the same time.
