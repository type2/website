Subject: double relay question

Hi Volks!  I've suffered with hard cold starting of my recently rebuilt 
2.0L GE (it starts perfectly when warm)  and I proceeded to do some tests 
according to Bentley.

In testing the double relay,  I only made it through the first 2 tests.  It 
says put one end of a test lite to terminal 85 and one end to 88y and then 
88z.  When I put one end to 88y and 88z, the light did in fact come on, but 
the relay clicked as if it was the test light that actually made the 
connection both times.  It did this on both 88y and 88z.  Is this 
normal?  also, when I checked 86c, the relay only buzzed a while, then 
eventually clicked and the test light came on.  I suspect a possible bad 
relay.  Am I heading in the right direction?  tx, Greg
