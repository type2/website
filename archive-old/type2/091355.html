Subject: Re: [T2] '78 westy timing

The numbers are not on the pulley, they are on a plastic strip that bolts
between the post at 7 o'clock and the post at 12 o'clock beside the
pulley.  The fan has a tiny notch on the forward rim that matches against
this scale.  If your scale is missing, www.busdepot_dot_com, www.busboys_dot_com
and VWoA all sell it for &lt; $10 USD

If you have any trouble locating the notch on the fan, go to:
