Steve Lashley asked?

&gt;So how does one top off the steering box?  Does it have to be removed?

Nope.  Get access to the box, you may have to remove the pan under the
front.  Pry off the rubber filler plug near the top and add 80w90 gear oil
slowly with a suction gun.  If you don't have a suction gun, get one. It's a
cheap and very useful tool to add/remove fluids from anything.
