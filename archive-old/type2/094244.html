&gt; I thought so too... but I cant figure out how that's possible with all of

This does seem misleading: http://type2_dot_com/library/electrip/axwir.htm

You have to run a second hot wire to the fuse box to power particular items
using the aux battery? :-(

The campmobile supplement states:

- the aux battery is intended to cool the fridge for short periods of time.

- the city power outlet charges the battery and runs the fridge.

- do not operate fridge for &gt; 4 hours

- the fridge will run down the battery and cause starting problems because
the batteries will balance during the starting operation.


So, all this would imply that in addition to the relay kit if would be wise
to have a quick disconnect attached to the aux battery terminal in case you
need really cold drinks for a long time and wish to don't feel like
enlisting the kids help to roll start the bus. :-(

This isn't how I understood how the system worked.  I thought the two
batteries connected together via the relay only after the engine started.

Can someone explain to me when D+ from the alternator is energized?
