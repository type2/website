Subject: cal vehicle scrap notification

I signed up for the email service telling of vehicles to be scrapped in the 'south coast' area of california that Tony from NJ posted a few weeks ago and received the first notice today.

They give you make and year and a partial VIN. You can then apparently make appointments to look at the vehicles and buy them. I'll let y'all know of any VW opportunities as I recieve them.
