Subject: stripped bumper bolt holes

hey all, i've run into a bit of a dilema.  today i was putting my rear 
bumper back on (finally), when i noticed that the two right side bolt holes 
are stripped out.  what can i do to hold my bumper on? should i just re-tap 
the holes and screw larger bolts in?  i'm not really sure on what to do, as 
i don't want to screw anything up. also, when putting the new engine seal 
on, i noticed that i only needed two pieces instead of the three that i was 
told i needed. so if anyone needs an extra engine seal (not firewall) from a 
70, just drop me a line and i'm sure i can remedy that.
