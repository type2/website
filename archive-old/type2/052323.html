Subject: [T2] Stuck Bolts

List-
I have now moved to the caliper on the other side of my 72 Westy. I am only
trying to remove the caliper so I can pull the hub to inspect the inner
bearings. The caliper bolts are stuck. PB Blaster over night. Then my
breaker bar trick that worked on the other side. I put a 1/2 inch drive
breaker bar and socket on the bolt then use blocks to prop it against the
floor, then release the jack and let the weight of the bus twist the bolt.
Didn't work. (I was careful to make sure I was twisting the right way)
Something has to break. I'd like to ask all of you for the crude but
effective ways to get frozen bolts off. I'd rather not break the tool or
the bolt. Any suggestions?
This makes me think that the last time this hub has off was a long time ago.
