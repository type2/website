Subject: valve adjust after rocker removal?

Nearly Friday so bare with me on these two questions:
I just replaced the pushrod tube seals (a la Bartnik) in my 1.8L FI engine, 
and am curious to know if anyone recalls how far off their valve clearances 
were after such a replacement. I haven't reset mine, they sound just the 
same as before, and I was more interested in verifying that the leaks were 
gone than in checking the valves, so took a &quot;pass' on that task. It would 
seem that if you put the rockers and pushrods on exactly as they were before 
removal that the clearances shouldn't have changed very much. Any experience 
would be appreciated.
Second: a friend is needing a replacement manual transmission for his '74. 
What range of year model donor vans would be compatible with his? And if he 
finds one at a wrecking yard, what are the the things you can do to evaluate 
it, if any?
Thanks in advance,
Roland Finston
'75 Westy
