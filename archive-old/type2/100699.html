Now I would like to appeal to all your list great members to tell me what the heck I have? It's got 85,400 miles on it. The older gentleman who sold it to me had an outfit in CA rebuild the engine using a 4 cylinder Porsche 914 engine. (less the heads) It's no longer fuel injected and has 2 Weber carbs and Jacobs ingnition......

Greg,

The porsche 914, vw bus from 72-83.5, and the vw 411,412 all received a similar engine, commonly known around here as the &quot;type 4&quot; engine as it was designed primarily for the type 4 volkswagens.

The biggest difference for the 914 would've been the heads, which you say you don't have, so I'm guessing you just had a bus motor that was rebuilt as a bus motor.

What is your engine code? Stamped on the case, and also on the fan shroud on the left as you poke your head in the engine bay. (Fan shrouds can be switched)

Westfalia produced three levels of campers, the hardtop camper or &quot;weekender&quot;, the basic poptop, and the deluxe poptop, which would've had the stove and a few other ammenities. Sounds like you have a basic poptop.

You should have already found the best source for bus info on the net, type2_dot_com! Stay tuned and you'll hear of many others to add to your library of favorites, as I have.

Welcome aboard,

Billy
visalia, CA
76 hardtop camper (converted to passenger)
79 deluxe sunroof (project)
