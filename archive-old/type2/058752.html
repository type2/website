Subject: RE: Fuel Injection Problems

&gt; Subject: Fuel Injection Problems
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know how the fuel injection system works for sure? I
&gt; understand that all fire at the same time, but should I have 12v on both
&gt; leads when I turn the key to the on position? And should both leads strobe
&gt; when I try to start?
&gt;  The problem I'm having is when I start the 78 Type 2 It will fire
&gt; immediately then die. So I think the cold start valve is working. But the
&gt; injectors themselves don't seem to .. any help?
&gt; 
&gt; 
	[]  Fred: The fuel injection works as follows. 
	One side of the fuel injector is hooked to 12V thorough ballast
resistor. 
	The other side goes to the control unit. 
	When the control unit wants to inject gas,
	it opens the injector by grounding the wire going to the injector, 
	and current flows from the 12V through the ballast resistors,
	 through the injector, through the control unit to ground. 
	All injectors are pulsed at the same time.

	So to test this system. 
	With the key on ,and engine cranked by starter, or
	running for a few seconds on the cold start valve.
	With the injector unplugged, and measuring on the 
	plug, not the injector.

	One side of the plug should have steady 12V to ground
	This is the ballast resistor side.
	If you measure from a 12V source to the other contact in the plug
	the voltage should pulse from approx. 0 - 12V.
	Given the above, if you measure across the two contacts in the plug
	there should be a pulsating voltage going from approx 0V to approx
12V.
	Another way to test this with a lamp is to connect the test lamp
from
	a source of 12V (battery?) to the contact of the plug that goes to
the control
	unit. As above, the test lamp should pulse on  and off.
	You can also hook the test lamp across the plug, and it will pulse,
but not as
	brightly becasue teh ballast resistor is in series with the test
lamp in this
	case. This is the way I did it, when debugging, I had long wires on
the test lamp
	and put it up in the cab so I could see it while running the key.

	[]  NOTE: If you don't have the steady 12V on the ballast resistor
side, one thing 
	to check if the backup lights connection, and fuse. On my van a 76,
the injectors are
	powered through the backup lights fuse. This is a wire going from
one side of the 
	coil, through a inline fuse holder towards the left front of the
engine compartment. 
	I hadn't hooked this up, thinking I didn't need to bother with
lights etc until I got the
	engine running again. Took a while to figure that one out;-(
