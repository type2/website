Subject: BN4 Heater Bracket

Hey everyone,
  Don't post much but am always reading. Need some help finding a part.  Does anyone have one of the &quot;L&quot; brackets that support the rear, heat exchanger, portion of the late model BN4 heaters for a bus. The fuel pump also mounts to this bracket. This is one of the last major parts I need to get my heater setup. If anyone has one they would part with please let me know! :)

Thanks,
Casey
