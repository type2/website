Subject: Re: [T2] Which Distributor?

&gt; At the risk of opening a can of worms, and a big debate, I'd like to 
&gt; know the if it is best to stay with my stock distributor and points or 
&gt; should I invest in a &quot;Bosh 009&quot; and the Pertronix Ignitor, as offered 
&gt; by Ron and the gang at BD?  Or switch to electronic ignitor and keep 
&gt; the old distributor?

Pretty much everybody on this list agrees that the 009 is a POS. It does 
not have a good advance curve for a bus. They are okay in a bug, but 
still not as good as stock.

If you want to upgrade something get a Petronix or Compufire to replace 
the points. No more points or condensor to replace. Keep a spare set of 
points and a condensor in case the Petronix or Compufire fail.
