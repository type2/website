&gt; Hello fellow listee's!
&gt; I have a brief question. can 185/14 tires be put on a
&gt; 1978 camper van? I currently have 195/14's on my bus,
&gt; but a friend gave me 185/14's, and would like to put
&gt; them on. Suggestions?

That's the stock size, if you haven't abbreviated any &quot;/75&quot;'s from the
designation.

This size has to be load range &quot;C&quot; or better.  Standard load tires don't
cut it!  Be sure that the load rating on the side of the tire is 1540
pounds or greater.
