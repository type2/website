Subject: Re: [T2] Timing gun issues...

You said you have a '78 so the timing mark on the *pulley* is on the FRONT 
side of the pulley; it's a little tiny thing, sort of like somebody took one 
stroke with a hacksaw to the pulley edge.  Find the mark and enhance it with 
a little white paint so it'll stand out when the timing light &quot;stops&quot; it 
when the plug fires.  You then compare where the mark is when it's &quot;stopped&quot; 
to the timing scale.

&gt; You're right!  Sorry bout that.  I hooked it up that way and it worked 
&gt; right away.  Now I have a new issue....Where do I aim this blinking dot? 
&gt; I know you're supposed to aim it at the scale (which I have to order, but 
&gt; for the time being I have one made of cardboard), but how/where exactly? 
&gt; Thanks alot for your advice to a newbie.
