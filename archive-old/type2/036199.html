&gt; I bought some Valvoline 80W-90 gear oil and I plan on changing my tranny
oil
&gt; this weekend. The book says 90 weight hypoid. Have I got the right stuff?

Where are you??  You posted this Monday afternoon? And here in California it
is 2:56 PM on Sunday.

As long as the gear oil you bought is GL 4 you should be OK. Do NOT use it
if it says GL 4/5, GL 5, or GL 3-4-5. All Valvoline gear oil I have seen has
NOT been straight GL 4. The most common brand of GL 4 is Sta Lube. Sta Lube
says GL 4 on the front label.
