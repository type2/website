Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Replacing battery tray

    Just had to chime in on this one as I have just taken on the project of
replacing the battery tray on my '72 last week. I have decided to try out
some stainless steel sheet metal in this application. I have removed all of
the rusted metal and have fabricated the replacement piece.
    I have left a pretty good lip all around from the old battery tray. I
have not as of yet fastened the new stainless tray in yet and was trying to
decide how to do this. As was mentioned, pop rivets look a little less than
&quot;clean&quot;. I was thinking of finding some adhesive to hold it in place.
     I like the idea of replacing this piece with stainless as it is a high
corrosion area. Would be glad to post pics of the replacement pc that I
fabricated. Would also be willing to fabricate some more if anyone is
interested. -Jeff
