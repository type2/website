Sorry to hear of your invasion.

As I've written in the past, it's a good idea to get a locking latch on the
engine compartment as well.

There's no shortage of &quot;midnight auto supply&quot; enthusiasts out there, and
some very vital [and expensive] parts can disappear from the engine room
very quickly.

I've had a locking engine lid latch for over 20 years, and have even
transferred it between buses.  I'd become pretty complacent about keeping it
locked until I caught 3 [three!] guys with their heads and hands in the
engine room at 1:00AM a couple of years ago.

&gt;&gt;  Just a quick reminder. When your locking up your bus dont forget about
the hatch. You wouldnt think someone would crawl through the bus via the
hatch but it happened.  &lt;&lt;
