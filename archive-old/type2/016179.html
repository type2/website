This is the beginning of the end for one of your bearings.  I found this in
a 1600 and it looks like aluminum foil.  When I split the case, I found one
of the rod bearings was completely gone.  It looked like the bearing was
never even installed.  Good luck.

&gt;I just changed my oil and found some tiny shavings in the sludge that
&gt;builds up in the cover under the strainer.  They were shiny, looked like
&gt;aluminium and very thin, like gold leaf.  The biggest piece was about 2mm
&gt;by 4mm.
&gt;Should I be concerned about this?  I haven't noticed anything like this
&gt;before.  The engine isn't making any funny noises.  Anyone care to hazard a
&gt;guess as to what they might be?
