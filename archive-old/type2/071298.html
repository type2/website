I went with craftsman, my dad w/Mac. He likes mine better because you turn the
handle base and reads in Kg or Ft lbs. Go for the smaller, you've got more
critical settings, ie, cv joints are 19ft lbs if memory serves me. For the big
stuff I just let my 1/2 &quot; snapon air wrench run untill it stops ; )
I think it was apx 90.00 at sears
