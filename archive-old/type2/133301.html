&gt; So isn't this the same thing as running a car on propane or natural gas?

actually engines get less BTU per unit of fuel running on Propane or
Natural gas, the Buses (transit type) replace a 140 gal diesel fuel tank
with 3-5 cyl running most of the length of the roof of a 40 ft bus and
they get less range.

&gt; Shouldn't those fuel types deliver a HUGE increase in MPG just because
&gt; the fuel is already vaporized? I know those two fuels have less power
&gt; per lb than gasoline so their fuel mileage is a bit worse even if much
&gt; cleaner.

nope, it is the amount of BTU's produced per unit to provide the power.
so far no one has violated the law of the conservation of energy.

&gt; I'd LOVE to have a 40 mpg VW Bus and a 50 mpg Honda - all retro fitted
&gt; by me.

yeah me too

&gt; Never heard of running an engine on coal! Was it the coal that was
&gt; flammable or just the fine dust or a combo of both? Thinking about grain
&gt; elevator explosions here. Fine dust that is explosive.

during WWII there were a number of interesting (desperate) methods used to
provide power, one was to tow a small coal tar generator behind a vehicle,
usually a bus or truck, very inefficient, very dirty but when all the gas
and diesel was heading to the front it &quot;moved&quot; under it's own power.
and that was sufficient
