Subject: How many grease fittings?

As soon as the driveway dries from this week's record-breaking rain here 
in SoCal, I'm going to clamber under the Wonderbus to smoosh grease in 
all the fittings that I can find, with my handy-dandy new grease gun. 
But, how many fittings should I expect to find?  I'd hate to overlook 
one, and I don't recall seeing a listing of them all.

A Zerking we will go, a Zerking we will go, hi-ho the Oleo, a Zerking we 
will go.
