&gt; &gt; Hey guys,
&gt; &gt;   I just recently had the engine rebuilt (1800 carburated) in my westy a
few
&gt; &gt; weeks back. I have just finished putting the engine in and I have come
&gt; &gt; across a problem. When ever I try to put it in reverse the engine cuts
out.
&gt; &gt; It does not jerk forward when it cuts out either, the engine just cuts
out.

You could have the reverse fuse hooked up to the wrong side of the coil
BTDT... Check it out...

Peace Brother,
