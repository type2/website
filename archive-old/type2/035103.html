&gt; Dunno Bob it seems fine to me

site was fine, but I am on a text only server so I can't see the map,
there used to be a state by state list of members but couldn't find that.  

the problem came when I tried to send message to the webmaster, the
message to the webmaster came back.  &quot;unknown address&quot;
