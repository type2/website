Subject: Choke heating elements.

Hi volks,

	Can anyone confirm whether the auto-choke elements on the various
Solex
carbs are interchangeable? I would expect that they are the same
electrically
(though obviously early busses will have 6V ones) but that there might be
fit
differences.

 I have a duff one but am having problems finding a replacement- anyone
got a spare? It's for a 34PDSIT.

Cheers,
	 W.
