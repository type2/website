Subject: Special 1968~79 VW Type 2 Ignition Coil !?!

From: Nigel A. Skeet
To: All Listees
Date: 28th October 2001
Reply to: naskeet_at_hotmail_dot_com

Illustrated on Page &amp; Frame 94-10, of the Official 1968~79 VW Type 2, 
Replacement Parts Catalogue &amp; Microfiche, is a special Ignition Coil, (Item 
No. 2) with three water-proof gland connections, for the both the LT and HT 
leads, plus ignition distributor, leads and other components with matching 
connection fittings.

I possess the ignition coil and one matching lead (length 275mm, 10.75 
inches), having the following part numbers.

Ignition coil (Item 2) - VW Part No. 122 905 115 D
                       - Bosch Part No. 0 221 107 001

Matching lead (Item 25 ?) - VW Part No. 181 905 721
                          - Bosch Part No. 0 290 320 009

Which VW Type 2s were they intended for?

I noticed something similar, fitted to the old NATO mobile field gun 
manouevering units (featured in VW Motoring magazine, some years ago), which 
had a VW Type 4 industrial engine.

The parts were wrongly supplied to my father by the local VW-Audi franchise 
26 years ago, as part of a touring spares kit, for our 1973 VW 1600 Type 2.

If they are of interest to anyone, these boxed, unused new-old-stock items, 
are available for sale or trade.

Regards.

         Nigel A. Skeet
