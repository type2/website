Subject: Re: dangers of a front mounted spare (Myth busters)

Ya know---

Waaay back when I drove / owned a bunch of early Chevy and Ford van's
( Dodge had one too ) that was similar to the Bus / Vanagon
configuration ( except the engine was in between the front seats  not in
the rear) ,and I drove the heck outa them till they all died.

i can tell you this from experience---I went around a side street corner
too fast, clipped a parked car, and stopped the 65 Chevy on a dime when
I hit the parked car.

i was launched through the windshield faster than I could had had a
chance to even think about what was going on.
IF I had my seat belt on I would have been crushed between the front
sheet metal and the seat / steering column--so me getting blown outa the
winshield area  saved my butt.

I only cut my forehead oped 2-3 inches.

Looking back--these damn flat front ended Buses, &amp; Van's are dangerous--
regaredless who's name is on the front end.

Not much room for error, not muh room to duck and hide in an accident---
Your in it for the ride and end result.

It's just the nature of beast.



Hasta,
