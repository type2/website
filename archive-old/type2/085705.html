Subject: Re: [T2] head temperature sensor

Sorry Matt

Its WD40 not WD9 (Just a elder moment).  I haven't used WD40 this way so 
can't recommend it. Propane works but both are a little scary.

&gt;Hey Chuck,
&gt;
&gt;How are you? I just finished some work on my van. No success yet. This is
&gt;what I did today.
&gt;
&gt;I installed a new head temperature sensor. I started the van and the same
&gt;thing occured. It ran and then died shortly after. I next checked all 
&gt;vacuum
&gt;connections. Everything seemed to be fine. No cracked hoses and everything
&gt;seems to be connected properly. To confirm this I completely turned in
&gt;(clockwise) the hex screw on the Air Flow Measurement box as you suggested.
&gt;I started the van and the same thing happened. Absolutely no change. I
&gt;returned the screw to its original position (2 and one quarter turns out)
&gt;and tried the van again. Same thing happened. All battery connections are
&gt;clean.
&gt;
&gt;So what do you think? I don't know what to try next. Any advice?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Matt
&gt;

&gt;Matt
&gt;I think that you have a major leak. Low level leaks would have to be
&gt;numerous to cause such a condition on their own. I have had ground strap
&gt;(battery to chassis) that caused all sort of weird symptoms. Just last 
&gt;month
&gt;a rusty strap caused starting problems. As I wiggled it it would go too a
&gt;few ohms. A big ugly NAPA strap fixed that problem. A poor strap from the
&gt;tyranny to chassis can cause the clutch cable to fail I am told. Seems
&gt;conduction through the cable causes metal migration problems.
&gt;
&gt;Its hard to work in the cold.  Hunting for vacuum leaks has been a way of
&gt;life for me and my 77.  I have to believe leaks are problematic in the 
&gt;older
&gt;FI models.
&gt;
&gt;You can adjust the Air Fuel Mix with the hex screw on top of the Air Flow
&gt;Measurement box. Turn it clock wise until it hits bottom (count the turns).
&gt;This is as rich a it can go. Hook up the sensor and see if it will run. 
&gt;This
&gt;mixture adjust inter acts with the idle adjust screw so the idle will most
&gt;likely be off. But if this lets it run with sensor hooked up it points to a
&gt;vacuum leak.
&gt;
&gt;In this case go to the Type2 search engine and type Vacuum leak for a 
&gt;wealth
&gt;of info.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck and let me know what you find.

&gt;&gt;Chuck,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Last fall I was driving and the bus just died out. It didn't sputter or 
&gt;&gt;run
&gt;&gt;rough it just stop running. I pulled over took a look at the engine and
&gt;&gt;seen nothing. It immediately started again and off I went. This continued
&gt;&gt;happening. Not at an exact interval but consistently happening. It was
&gt;&gt;usually around 10 or 15 minutes of driving. It was at the end of the year
&gt;&gt;so I only drove a few times before I stored it for winter.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I just took it out of storage and started it up and voila the new problem
&gt;&gt;has come up. It starts, runs at high rpm(around 2000), and then dies after
&gt;&gt;a minute. Everybody has been saying battery connections, vacuum tubes, or
&gt;&gt;head temperature sensor.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have cleaned all battery connections but have yet to check the ground
&gt;&gt;strap as someone mentioned. I have tested the sensor as I mentioned before
&gt;&gt;and from what you were saying it seems to be working. I have not started 
&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;look for vacuum leaks but I do know that there is a big vacuum hose that
&gt;&gt;has a loose fit. It's the one that goes to the deaccellerator valve I
&gt;&gt;believe. It's connected but should be clamped. Would a loose fitting hose
&gt;&gt;cause such a problem?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It has been snowing up here for the last week so not the most pleasent
&gt;&gt;weather to work in. Anyway I would like to get it running and tune it up
&gt;&gt;for spring.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks alot for your help,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Matt
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;Matt
&gt;&gt;You are not wrong the colder the temp the higher the resistance and the
&gt;&gt;richer the fuel/air mix. What happened to start this problem off?

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks Chuck,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I live in Ottawa, ON, Canada and it was about 0 degrees celcius yesterday
&gt;&gt;&gt;when I did the testing. Perhaps the cold temp is responsible for the high
&gt;&gt;&gt;resistance before start up. I always thought it was the opposite though.
&gt;&gt;&gt;That resistance decreased as temperature increased. Am I wrong? Anyway I
&gt;&gt;&gt;will check all the vacuum hoses and get back to you with what I find.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Matt
