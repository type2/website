Here it is, Volks....

A recipe for a cool VW!   (If there are any informed dissenters, please assist!)

Ingredients:

1 Aircooled Volkswagen (Bus or Vanagon in this case)
1 pair of those super-duper 2&quot; diameter blower fans(I saw a set in an issue of  
 J.C. Whitney with 2&quot; tubing)
1 pair rubber flanged thingy do-whatsit......??  (Something to fabricate)
Some kind of thermostat and/or a switch
some wire
jigsaw or some such with metal-cutting blade

There may be more, but only time will tell....I'm sure some of you might already 
know what I'm getting at....the guy at my VW FLAPS said thatit wasn't 
good/necessary...I say he's full of chevy!

Instructions:  

Cut holes in top tin centered over the heads.  Mount fabricated flange thingy 
(must be airtight!) with 2&quot; blower unit set to blow into cooling fin array.  _at_' 
ducting to fan should be routed to outside (new set of louvered vents?) to 
access fresh air.  Set up switch to turn on/off, or use a thermostat to control 
the on/off and speed of the fan units, thereby having more control over the 
running temps of your VW.
