Subject: Re: Welding Body Panels

 Don, I agree with Bob, I've got a Century (since bought out by Lincoln,
still made by them with their name on it), and I used flux core wire to
start with. It hisses and spits a bit and leaves some splatter, but if you
are patient you can use it and grind just a little bit more. I then bought
the gas attachment and a bottle of gas for it, and the difference is
noticeable. If you are on a budget, use the flux core wire without the gas
until you can afford to buy the add-on gas setup. Like most working stiffs,
I have to save up to buy good stuff, and for the start of welding, the flux
core wire was all I could justify. 

Just make sure the welder you buy is upgradeable to the gas kit.

 

HTH,
