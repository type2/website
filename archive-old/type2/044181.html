Hello everyone,

 This is to remind everyone that the Josh Rogers Memorial Beer Bash and
Campout (JRMBBC II) is going to be held next month. The date has changed
from 8-10 Sept to 15-17 Sept. The date change was requested by several
people due to the Eureka Springs and BBTA events being two weekends in a
row. I will pass out flyers at BBTA for those who are interested. Go to
http://my.treeway_dot_com/OKArt  , click on JRMMBC for more info.
