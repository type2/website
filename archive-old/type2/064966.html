FWIW, 
You should try out a very good electronics store (aka NOT Radio Shack!). 
Ask for a voltage regulator that will step down 12 volts DC to 1.5 volts 
DC. I know 12v to 9v are available, etc. but 1.5 v is pretty small. The 
device you are looking for will have three little legs for soldering 
connected to an approximately 1cm square chip. Its backside will be metal 
so you can attach a heat sink to it. Just a thought...

====================
  

Coupla observations:

1)  Most 3 terminal regulators can be set up as variable regulators.  It
involves adding a few external resistors (or a variable resistor) as a voltage
divider to set the output voltage.  Usually the Mfgr. data sheet will provide
the info (both wiring diagram and calculation formula to determine resistor
values) to do this.

2)  In the specific application, needing 1.5 volts
  a)  A 5 volt regulator is a common computer item and readily available,
cheap
  b)  It's fixed output value is already close to what's desired
  c)  I vaugely recall that most 3 terminal regulators have a minimum load
specified (anyone out there that can confirm this for me, I don't have access
to data sheets right now) that MAY be greater than the nominal load of the
temperature gauge (w/o light) in which case you'd have to either add a dummy
load or just run the light all the time
  d)  there are a few device limitations to keep in mind, the max output
current the device can handle (needs to be compatible with load) AND the max
device power dissipation.

3)  You can VERY crudely think of a 3 terminal regulator as just a dropping
resistor if the input voltage and output current and voltage are fixed.  In
that case, the difference between the input and output voltage is dissipated
as heat, just as in a resistor.  The advantage of using a 3 terminal regulator
over a resistor is that it accomodates variations in input voltage and in
output current draw while holding a fixed output voltage.  The power
dissipated is roughly the product of the output current times the voltage drop
across the regulator.  For example, ( 14.4 - 1.5) x 0.05 amps = 0.645 watts. 
I choose 0.05 amps as a wild guess at what the thermometer draws w/o the light
or LEDs, add an estimated 0.03 amps per LED and maybe 0.08 =&gt; 0.1 for a light
bulb and the total draw goes to about 0.2 amps which drives the regulator
power dissipation to 2.58 watts.    So selection criteria for the regulator
must include:  output voltage, ability to be wired as an adjustable regulator,
output current capacity, and device dissipation.  A heat sink is a pretty much
assured necessity.
