Subject: more on my new longblock, f*kinbroken

went out and looked at the engine again, and i noticed that the bolt that
hold the pulley in the crank broke off, half of it is still in the crank.

i also thought back: i set the timing initially to 7.5 BTDC as always.
checked it a couple days later (i have a pertronix, timing shouldn't change,
right?) but the timing was advanced, i forget exactly, it was to the left of
7.5. so i retarded it a little, took a ride and the engine had less power.
came back and checked again, and the timing was too far retarded, so i
advanced it again to 7.5 btdc.  did this happed b/c my fan pulley was moving
around the whole time?

anyways, does this help my situation or make it worse. definitely makes it
harder to fix if there's a bolt broken off inside the crank.

thanks for all the input
