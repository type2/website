Subject: RE: Luggage Rack Spacers

I recently repainted my roof and decided to make new spacers.  I had =
very good luck using a combination of parts from the hardware store.  =
The total cost was around $12. =20
The spacer is make up of two rubber plugs inserted into the ends of a =
plastic bushing.  The plastic bushing can be cut to make the length =
appropriate (my roof was dented in at the corners so I needed slightly =
longer spacers). I've posted some pictures for people to view at =
www.sitespecific_dot_net/stage/hal/spacers.htm.
