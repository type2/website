&gt;Any idea what will fit ???

&gt;I have a 73 panel and would like to put some kind of mag rim on it.
&gt;
&gt;what size rim will fit under the rear wheelwell with a normal 70s series
tire?
&gt;
&gt;either 14inch or 15inch but approx. the same height so it will have the same 
&gt;gear ratios
&gt;

Damn nicest looking mag IMHO is the factory Vanagon alloy, and it's one
tough SOB of a rim.  Direct bolt on size though you'd need to find 2 sets of
the special lug nuts it requires (as the front in a vanagon uses bolts
instead.)
14x6 with ET 30mm.

These are a heavy 5 spoke design looking sort of like a Chevy Blazer mag,
and they have Volkswagen on em.  14&quot; though so not worth crap to someone
wanting big tires.  They fit under a Bus with Firestone Wilderness AT's in
27x8.5R14 so something smaller isn't an issue (why don't they recall my
Firestones so I can get new tires BTW)

Otherwise, on the cheap and quality, late Audi 5000 Turbo alloys, were
designed for a similar weight vehicle, but they may need machining and might
require spacers.  Otherwise there are a lot of weird 70's alloys that float
around
and fit in 14 and 15 inch and Fast German and others are selling a lot of
stuff
now days but a lot of it doesn't look like something I'd put under a 5000lb
camper or a loaded panel.  80's MBZ alloys are another source but I just don't
think a Mercedes alloy looks right on anything but a Mercedes, now if you
found a set of AMG or other aftermarket MBZ rims, maybe.  Brake clearance
with any of these is likely the issue, but I don't bet it will often be a
problem on
a Bus, it gets to be an issue on post '86 Vanagons with big brakes.  There
is a
chance you'd need to machine the center out, but a Bus doesn't need
hubcentric wheels like a FWD VW.

I'm still for the Vanagon alloy, now you'll get idiots wanting like $200+
each for
these things, but if you look around you can find em for $50 a pop at yards
that don't deal import, or take offs from syncro owners who went to 15&quot; or
wherever.  $100 each I guess in nice shape would probably be fair value, a bit
more with nice rubber.  And those nuts you need are REAL pricey and only from
VW AFAIK so factor that in, and make sure you get the set that was on the
Vanagon.  These are pretty common on post '87 GL's and higher trim, and the
spare is an alloy as well on these cars so check spare tire wells at yards
even
if the van is stripped.  I've bought 3 that way, worth less to them as they
didn't
have a full set and hadn't realized the spare was an alloy, got two of them
with new MXL's no less.
