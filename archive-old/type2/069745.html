Subject: Re: Door &amp; Window rubber experiences?

&gt;I would like to hear from anyone who has used the following 
&gt;suppliers for door &amp; window rubber:
&gt;
&gt;West Coast Metric
&gt;Wolfsburg West

I have used window rubber from both of these companies.  I got the door
rubber from WCM.  It was really stiff, making it a pain to put in and to
close the door.  The piece that the door glass assemblies sit on is just a
bit too narrow, making it a PITA to get those assemblies in.   For some
reason, RMMW wanted $150 per _side_ for the window rubber; WCM wanted $150
per _set_.  Big difference, IMHO.

Popout window rubber from both companies seems to be good.  Windshield seals
from WW seem to be a bit &quot;cleaner&quot; looking than WCM's.

I replaced every single piece of rubber on the '56.
