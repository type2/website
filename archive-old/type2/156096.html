Subject: Re: [T2] Need Better Freeway Gears

Hi Doug,

I can't say for certain about the r+P swap, I don't mess around  
inside trannys. But I can say that a popular course of action in this  
case is to go to the 091 (six-rib) transmission as used from 1976-79.  
You will need to swap over some parts from your current transmission  
to make this work properly. (Nosecone, bell housing and starter).  
That will get you about 5% more speed in top gear.

The other mod you can do to get more speed is switch to a larger rear  
tire. This is also a quick fix to saggy bus butt.

BUT: Unless you add more torque to the engine you are going to stress  
it. Hill climbing and accelleration will suffer.  Adding extra load  
to the engine while at the same time dropping the oil pressure and  
cooling fan speed doesn't seem like a good idea for long term engine  
longevity. YMMV.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
