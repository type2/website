&gt; &gt; Thanks Bob,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This exactly why I wrote &quot;Load range C does not mean squat. What is
&gt; &gt; the max load weight marked on the side?&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you guys want to bet your life on Load range C, go right ahead!
&gt;
&gt; While you're correct that you must pay attention to the max load weight
&gt; marked on the tire, I don't think it's correct to say &quot;Load range C
&gt; does not mean squat.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; As I understand it, you need to pay attention to both:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Load range&quot; refers to the stiffness of the sidewall, and thus lateral
&gt; force the sidewall can withstand... particularly important when one is
&gt; steering a Bus, going around a corner or bend in the road, etc.

Somebody's been feeding you a line, I fear.

Load range is simply a maximum weight that a tire can carry in a given
size.  The bad news is that that maximum weight varies from size to size.

Sidewall stiffness results directly from the sidewall construction, which
is a function of the pressure that the tire is designed to hold.  Higher
load ranges hold higher pressures and have stiffer sidewalls.

You can't go wrong with a 185R14 in load range C or D.  Lots of excess
capacity and nice stiff sidewalls.  It's the size specified by VW.  It's
available.  There is little reason to experiment.
