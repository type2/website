&gt;Many thanks Richard, very clear!! I seem to have a high idle as well, and after reading the fellows post about the decel valve, I notice that my hose off the decel valve is disconnected and just sitting there. From your picture it is the big one on top going off to the left of the pic. I know this should be connected to something. Could this be why I have a high idle?

The decel valve lets air from the intake hose bypass the throttle body during high vacuum conditions (start of deceleration).

If the brake booster connection for the decel valve is plugged and the left side of the decel valve left disconnected, I suppose you could have a high idle if the diaghragm was broken.
