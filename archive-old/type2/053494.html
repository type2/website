Subject: Thank you to all

   Just wanted to drop a line and say thanks for all the volks who responded 
about my shock problem.  After looking at my mounting studs again- you were 
all right- the bushing had rusted themselves so convincingly to the studs- 
that they looked like one piece.  After inventing some new swear words- I got 
them loose.
   
 In local paper-   1980 Westy- good condition- new parts -  3500 or offer
                          Appleton WI

  Thanks all again
