Subject: RE: [T2] Alternator needed

Tyler,

Joe here at BUStedBUS_dot_com. We sell the 75X for $74.55. This would also be a
opportune time to put a larger 108X for $141.00. (a new tin piece and boot
is needed for this). These are good used, tested alternators. Here is my
take on this stuff. If you want to save money, buy used. If your worried
about putting it in and having it fail and having to take it out then spend
a little more money and have it tested yourself. This will assure you a good
used one. Tyler aren't you in Denver CO? We are in Boulder.

Subject: [T2] Alternatoer needed


HI,
I need an alternater for my 74 bus. I would like a
good used one since new ones are out of my price
range. I was looking at the motorworks catalog and it
says that there is the same 55 amp alternater works on
72-79 busses. If someone has a good used one to sell
please e-mail me.
Thanks,
Tyler
