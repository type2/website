Subject: Re: [T2] Hydro Seal

&gt; &quot;Warning: This product contains chemicals known
to the State of California to cause
&gt; cancer or birth defects or other reproductive
harm.&quot;

&gt; So, I guess  if you are not in the State of
California, then you are not at
&gt; risk??

That's true on so many levels. 
Californication...

&gt;Almost every product in the auto parts store has
that warning on it. There's
even a warning before you enter the store.

Yeah, but Sunny has my favorite sign on her site:
