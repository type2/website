Subject: Removing A/C in '85 Westy

Hey Jay,
          You lucky dudes up there in New Hampshire don't need air conditioning 
99% of the year!  I assume you are not thinking of resale value.  The purpose 
of my response (if there is any) is to remind you the 85 system is charged with 
R-12... which has high value, if you are not already aware of this.  Before you 
begin work to dismantle the A/C, take the vehicle to a shop that has recovery 
equipment and let them evacuate the system.  They may offer you some payment 
for the existing R-12, especially if you can convince them it has not been 
contaminated.  In any case, having the system evacuated reduces the risk to you 
of getting refrigerant in your eyes, on your skin, etc.  

A couple of years ago when I owned a Vanagon there was some interest on that 
list in A/C equipment; right now, with the price of even R-134a going through 
the roof, there may or may not be guys out there who would be motivated to 
install A/C.... I'll be interested to hear what you find on this subject.

From: &quot;Jay Brown&quot; &lt;badkarma_at_ttlc_dot_net&gt;

I am thinking very seriously about yanking the A/C out of my '85 Westy.  I
haven't used it for the past two summers and I would really like to have the
extra storage space for camping.  Has anyone on the list done this before?
I looked thru the Bentley and there wasn't a lot of info about removing the
A/C, and the archive wasn't responding when I just checked.  If anyone could
guide me thru the process I would be very appreciative.

I am also going to be needing a cabinet door and hinges for the top cabinet
if anyone has one available.  I can pay cash or trade for parts (A/C or
other)....

Thanks in advance,
Jay Brown
