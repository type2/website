&gt;(I hope my windshield washer is not on the inspection list.  I might blow
&gt;the inspectors mind as I pull the air hose into the passengers
&gt;compartment to compress my windshield washer reservoir.)

OK, now I have a dumb question.... I am still new to this great adventure of
Bus ownership. I just assumed my windshield washer pump was bad, but hadn't
checked yet. I noticed a funny little hose with what appeared to be an air
valve on it. Does the washer reservoir actually use air pressure?!
