Subject: Re: [T2] VDO clock

 
--Justin,

68-72 ones have silver trim circle in the center typical of the center of the speedo and idiot lights.

73-79 ones are solid black and generally run 40-80 bucks on ebarf.

I say 40 cuz I picked up a beautiful one for that amount only to have it stolen out of a big wooden crate which my speakers where mounted in, presumably the speakers were converted to meth and my clock's in a dumpster. Angry rant over.

the 2 1/8&quot; size is for a different vw or an aftermarket console. the vdo ones of which you speak are for the 3&quot; (+/-) hole next to the speedo.

&gt;Volks,

&gt;I've always thought it strange that my 78 Westy Deluxe didn't come with a
&gt;clock... but after seeing one
&gt;on a listmember's page, I decided I must have one!
&gt;
&gt;That being, what clocks will work? I did a quick search of E-*ay, and found
&gt;&quot;VDO clock VW&quot; a wide-ranging search, resulting in $10-$100 tags... one is 2
&gt;1/8&quot; and claims to fit VW, Audi and Volvo. Is this true? Someone pls point
&gt;me in the right direction, so I don't go off half-cocked and buy some crap
&gt;that won't work.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers!
