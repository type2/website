Agreed, in principal, but not in substance. Locally it's been an influx 
of the young, all wanting to experience the VW tradition, that has 
decimated the VW population. They hitched into town for a Deadhead 
concert (or similar) and saw all the kewl Veedubs... and motored away 
with one of their very own... with no idea of how to keep one running.

Buy 'em up, drive 'em off, burn 'em up. I imagine, somewhere in Eastern 
Oregon, some wrecking yards must have recycled hundreds of them into 
Ginsu knives.

Cheer up! Yours is getting more valuable all the time.
