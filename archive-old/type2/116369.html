Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Muir's sound file

Hi Volks-  I have a copy of the original sounds on a cassette which was
marketed many years back.  I have no way of getting these sounds in digital
format so that they could be put on the web for everyone's education.  If it
would be legal to do this and someone has the capabilities to get this done,
I will be glad to furnish the tape. TBear
