Subject: RE: [T2] Exhaust Manifold Torque Values

oh and also the PO did not go into why the heads failed.  I have the bill
from the work ( Oct 2004).  The PO was not to knowledgeable about VWs.
However if you were in the garage with us yesterday you would have seen a
very well kept engine over the past 27 years.  My one friend keeps pointing
out to me how loved this engine was and is.  Kept pointing out all the stock
things on it and things that are not on his 78 Riviera.  Which is very
reassuring.  (Yes cliff that's you I am talking about... He's a subscriber
to this list and will be reading it shortly...)

When the exhaust was taken off, there were none anyway.

I had bought a gasket kit that had everything and everyone. They were there

and I did not use them. Aarrggghh. It's all in the bus now and do not

think that it will be an issue.


Why did the previous head fail? Did the PO give you any reasons?

If the exhaust valves failed you can attribute that to the missing exhaust
gaskets and you'll probably be heading down the same road as the PO.
