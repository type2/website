Subject: My Kids broke my Bus

  After spending the day mountain biking I called my wife to
pick me up from a friends house (where she had dropped me
off that morning).  She commenced to tell me how she
couldn't because my kids broke my Westy.
  Saturday morning my wife dropped me off so I could go
riding.  She then went to the bank to get some cash.  She
parked at the curb in front of the bank 15 ft from the ATM.
She got out, got some cash and came back to a broken bus.
In that 2 min time period my kids (5 and 7) too the key out
of the ignition, tried to put it back in and some how turned
the ignition to the on position without the key.
  My wife gets back to the bus, tries to put the key in the
ignition but can't and notices the generator light is on and
tries to figure out what happened.  In hind sight she
realizes should could have just push started the bus and
driven home.  My wife calls my dad, who previously owned the
van, and he tells her to call a locksmith.  She called every
locksmith in town and they all laugh when she tells them
what kind of vehicle it is.
  When the locksmiths won't show, my dad drives up to help
and can't get the ignition fixed so he decides to try to
push start it.  The key has been on for hours so the points
were burnt up and the bus won't start.  (My wife now knows
that if anything like this happens again that if she can't
push start it to disconnect the battery.)  My gives my wife
and kids a ride home and they wait for me to get home.
While she is waiting my wife calls the FLAPS to find out
that the ignition switch for a 70 bus is not even listed.
  When I get home, I hear the story, pick up a universal key
switch from Kragens and find my dead bus.  I quickly realize
I really don't want to work on the bus in some parking lot
down town so I have it towed home.
  I spend the rest of the evening replacing my nice stock VW
ignition switch that fits the lovely original VW key with
it's unique shape that feels perfect when starting the van.
My new key looks like something used to open a gym locker.
Ugh!
  Being nice and hot in the california central valley this
weekend after replacing the key switch I had no urge to
replace the points until the next morning.
  The next morning was already warm put I replaced my points
(a first for me).  And since I was there I cleaned up the
electrodes on the battery.  The battery was to low to start
the van but it pushed started on the first try.  Finally.

  I'm still a newbie so here are my questions.

  Where can I get a stock ignition switch with stock keys?

  The van now seems to idle a little faster than it did
before.  Since I only messed with the points who does this
relate to the idle.  I set the gap to .016&quot; like my book
said.  Is this right or should I reset them to something
else.  Or do I just not do a good enough job setting them
and now need to recheck my work?
