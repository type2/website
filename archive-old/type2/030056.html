Missy,

Pretty much a no-brainer :-) Look at your coil.  There ought to be a black
wire to it that carries 12v from the main wiring harness on the
passenger's side of the engien compartment. There also will be another
black wire coming from it that goes to an inline fuse-holder and then into
the tin under the double relay.  check?  Is there a fuse in the
fuse-holder?  OK, now, crawl under the bus in front of the driver's side
wheel and look at the nose cone of the trans.  there is a switch there
that has two wires to it.  one goes to the fuse holder, the other goes
back into the backup lights.

The places to check for 12V with a VOM are:

At the coil... got 12V?  the iginition is on, yes?
At the fuse holder... both going in and coming out.
At the switch on the trans... one will have 12V, one won't. That's normal.
Shift into reverse and power should flow thru the switch.
with the bus in reverse and the key on, check for 12V at the reverse light
sockets.

If you have any problems, let me know.

&gt; So, do I need to take the rock shield off under the bus, or is this 
&gt; something I do on the inside?  The light does work at the selector...just a

&gt; 
&gt; I was just wondering how difficult this is going to be.  It seems like 
&gt; every step I take to get it inspected, I end up taking a step back, because 
&gt; something else happens.
&gt; 
&gt; I just hope this is a no-brainer.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

&gt; &gt;I'm glad you mentioned you have an automatic, because that changes the
&gt; &gt;answer.  First, no, the reverse lights have nothing to do with the hazard
&gt; &gt;flasher switch.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;On an automatic Bus, the reverse lights are controlled via a switch in the
&gt; &gt;base of the shifter on the cab floor.  You may have to get in there and
&gt; &gt;take a look.  While you're in there you can get the light that lights up
&gt; &gt;the gear selector display at night working :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;On a manual transmission Bus, the switch is actually screwed into the side
&gt; &gt;of the transmission and power comes from the ignition coil.  I'm not sure
&gt; &gt;if the automatic version is powered via the coil or not (don't have the
&gt; &gt;Bentley handy).
