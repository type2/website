Here is a picture of the compressor:

I don't have pictures of the rest online at the moment and the above 
picture is also a couple of years old.  The drive assembly in the picture 
has since broken, been repaired, broken again, been repaired again, and 
finally replaced with an all-steel version from a Porsche 912 courtesy of a 
friend on this list.  It will likely be months before my online presence 
improves.  :(

&gt; &gt; If you want A/C in your bus, I recommend piecing it together from the
&gt; &gt; dealer-installed systems that can be found in junkyard busses.  If you
&gt; &gt; don't mind doing some research and minor re-engineering, you can retrofit
&gt; &gt; the newer rotary compressors to reduce drag on your engine and have a very
&gt; &gt; nice, efficient system.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My basic formula for success was:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Overhead (inside) T-shaped evaporator
&gt; &gt; &quot;Stock&quot; condensor underneath the bus with better fans
&gt; &gt; Sanden SD-508 rotary compressor
&gt; &gt; New hoses
&gt; &gt; Freeze-12 refrigerant
&gt;
&gt;Do you have any pictures?
