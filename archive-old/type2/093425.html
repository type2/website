&gt;Showers - I must have one per day to really feel good.  If you are not 
&gt;staying at a campground, the beach is the best place to get a free 
&gt;shower.  In a pinch, you can sneak into a hospital or walk in the front 
&gt;gates of a KOA with your towel in a backpack.  Many truck stops have 
&gt;showers available for a few bucks if you're on the road.  A fitness club 
&gt;is, as someone else already mentioned, a great idea too.
=====================&gt;
Don't forget university gymnasiums facilities and public swimming pools.

&gt;Food - unless you are *really* on a budget, don't bother with cooking in 
&gt;your bus.  It's messy and time consuming and won't save you a whole lot of 
&gt;money anyway.
============================&gt;
Cheese, crackers, mustard, pickles, apples, = my all time reallygreat camp 
meal = easy and nice.
Cans of soup where you just heat the entire can in a boiling pot of water, 
then eat from a bowl = only a bowl to clean = use the hot water you used 
for heating it up.
Think ease of cleanup when thinking of meals, food selection, and preparation.
Breakfast = motels with the free breakfast buffet are nice. :-)

&gt;Privacy - Get a good set of curtains that are easy to put up and take 
&gt;down.  You will be doing this at least twice per day and if you can't do 
&gt;it quickly it will get aggravating.
========================&gt;
Hanging heavy count thread bedsheets or light canvas on the outside, cut to 
fit all the window sizes, and hung with binder clips is really fast and easy.
