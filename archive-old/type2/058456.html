Subject: need 79 exhaust parts

Help list:

My rebuilt engine is done and on the way back from AVP.  I still need to
find a left (driver's side) exhaust manifold so I can get this thing back
together and into the car.  This is a 79 California model with the weird
left heater box, catalytic converter next to the left head, hall ignition,
and oxygen sensor.  I believe that this manifold is the same for a 1980
vanagon.  I'd like to get a good used manifold with an intact heat shield.
New ones are available for $220 (no exploitation going on here!) and don't
have the heat shield.

Does anyone out there have one of these???

I've also wondered what would happen if I install an unshielded manifold.
I've gotten a couple of conflicting opinions on what the heat shield is
for.  I've heard that it shields the exhaust manifold from the heat from
the catalytic converter, I've heard that it shields the head from heat from
from the exhaust manifold, and I've heard that it protects the push rod
tubes from excessive heat from the exhaust manifold.  Any other opinions?
Has anyone run one of these without the heat shield for any length of
time???
