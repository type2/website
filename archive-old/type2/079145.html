Subject: Re: [T2] I need help!

Volks,

Mike wrote yesterday about his problems passing emissions and I wrote him
back, off-list, to check his vacuum system for a leak.  He asked my how
and what to look for and I replied.  I was doing a little looking and came
up with a GREAT page on using a vacuum gauge!  The URL is:

http://www.batauto_dot_com/articles/vacuum.html

The only caveat is that you should lower expected normal readings by an
inch or two.  V8s are timed by advancing the dist 'til the engine stumbles
and then backed off a bit.  Our VWs have rather more precise and retarded
timing specs.  By water-cooled standards, our engines  do have retarded
timing, and that is a good thing.

On where to connect the gauge, if you have FI, then there is a great port
on the passenger's side of the intake air distribution box between the
runners for cylinders #1 &amp; 2.  If you have a carb, then the vacuum brake
booster feed is the place to go (or see below for pre-71), but you will
need to rig or cut in an adapter... I have never seen a gauge with a 3/8&quot;
hose on it :-)  If you have a pre-71 bus, look for a port on the carb that
enters the throat of the carb *below* the throttle butterfly...  vacuum
retard and throttle positioner ports do this.

Whatever you do, don't use the vacuum advance port!  Remember that you
don't *want* that to have vacuum at idle! Otherwise you would have spark
advance at idle and that is a no-no.  As a result, you  *should* see
near-0 vacuum readings at the vac advance port at idle.
