&gt;If I measure manifold vacuum anywhere on my engine, I get a value of 15.

	That would be 15 psi vacuum.  This is the vacuum in the inlet 
manifold i.e anywhere between the carb and an inlet valve.
	But that reading will obtain only at idle or on the over-run. 
This is what's read by the dashboard vac gauges on many cars in the 
1980s  -  a passing fad but quite a sensible one.
	As soon as you open the throttle at all, this reading will 
drop.  Accelerating with the throttle wide open this reading (1 atm 
vacuum) drops to c. 1/6 atm.  Then if you cruise at c. half-throttle 
it may read c.1/3 atm i.e c. 5 psi.
	For a given road speed you want to maximize this manifold vac 
reading, for max economy.  This is one way to confirm the economy 
from floating down onto your cruise speed, rather than the usual 
approach from below.  A given cruise speed approached from above will 
read a higher inlet manifold vacuum than the same speed built up to 
from below as most drivers do.

	My favourite unit of vacuum is the inch of water barometer. 
Just as 1 atm ( = 1 bar if you want to seem more esoteric) holds up a 
column of mercury c.760mm high, so too it holds up a column of water 
30' high (no that is not an abbreviation for 1930).  As your water 
bottle is likely to be only a few inches below your needle where your 
water is sucked into the mixture after the combustion air has been 
fully loaded up with fuel, it's not surprising that a fairly fine 
needle is needed to restrict water feed to c. 5% of fuel feed with 
suctions c. 10' i.e 120&quot; of water barometer.
