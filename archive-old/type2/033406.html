Subject: re: uk distributor

&gt;Just found these guys today. http://www.justkampers.co_dot_uk/  Wonder if
anyone
&gt;had used them. Of course Im in Chicago and have yet to find out any
shipping
&gt;prices (gulp) I like the idea of a camper biased distributor. They even
have
&lt;snip&gt;

While I haven't used them (yet) - I'm intending to.  I ordered a catalogue
recently,
which took a while to come through (although they have been moving to larger

premises recently - so that might explain the delay)
Nonetheless, the prices look quite good, and they have quite a good range -
some tools, parts (mostly for Bays and Vanagons) and some accessories too.
I'm thinking of ordering some Heat Exchangers for my '70 Devon 1600SP
sometime soon, and some of those little conical rubber grommet things for
fitting the interior card panels - perhaps a few other bits too.

I'll let you know how I get on with them.
