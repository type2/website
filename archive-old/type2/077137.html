Subject: Re: [T2] RE: RE: bbbbbVI/hotel info



&gt; Buses by the Bridge host hotel.
&gt; I have gotten a pretty decent discount for those coming to BBB VI and 
want
&gt; to stay in a hotel.
&gt; The island inn hotel is across the street from BBB VI and is walking
&gt; distance

I've stayed at the Island Inn and it was a very nice place.  My wife 
and kids liked it very much!
