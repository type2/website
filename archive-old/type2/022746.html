On closer inspection, it is obvious that the '71 Westy photos are altered.
The sliding door is missing on the passenger side photo, so it's just a
mirror flip of the other one and the shadowed tires underneath have been
digitally added.  My guess is these wheel don't fit on an early Bay.  Also
look at the small 5 lug pattern.  Adapters or did they digitally add the
wheels into the photo too?

&gt; &gt;&gt; If you want custom wheels, check with these guys:

&gt; 
&gt; That's a neat look but can you actually get load range D in a 205/55/16?
&gt; They have these installed on a '71 Westy in the photo.
