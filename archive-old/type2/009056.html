There have been various raves about these wire
braid-covered brake lines . .

It has also been said they were a teflon hose . . I wouldn't
like that . .

The main item of interest tho is  they are not DOT
approved for road use . .

DOT in the US is the department of transportation,
much like other countries Ministries of trans. I would
imagine . . . 

A while back, 3 kids in Florida got some major jail-time
for knocking down a stop sign . .

Consider you are involved in a crash, involving brakes
and the other guys lawyer starts waving around your non-
compliant brake hose . . . 

More close to home perhaps is clear back when I was a 
beardless youth . . yes we had cars . .
Up in Colorado, they had this thing for &quot;Sleepers&quot;. .

A &quot;Sleeper&quot; was a car that looked  like hell but had all
the goodies hidden under the hood . .

The highway patrol up there was known to stop and condemn
your  car right there in the middle of nowhere . .

You gave them cause by it's appearance, now if you want 
to start pointing out your improvements like that 
big engine under the hood, they have been known to ask
for reciepts on all parts . .

This condemnation would always be about non-compliant 
to DOT standards or words to that affect . .

In all the big cities of the world, the cops are told 
what to look for today . . a cherry v-dub has often been
one of them . . they knew you were non-stock to some 
degree. . . 

Those stainless braid brake lines really stand out down
there, don't they ?  :-)

Yes Herb, I'm telling you they can slide you right out
of your car if they want to . .

They can also have you and your kids eating beans for the
next 20 years . .

I'm kind of ambivalent about these shiny hoses myself . .

A DOT approval would involve tests to prove so many cycles 
of flex and so many panic stop pressures and so on . .
A pull test  to check the hose crimp . 

So while these braided brake lines don't seem to be falling
apart on anybody . . . they're not DOT approved . .

Kind of takes the sparkle out of your eyes, don't it ?  :-)
