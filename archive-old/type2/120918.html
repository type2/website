Subject: Re: Rear-end groaning under accelleration...confused

Thanks a lot for the help.  I'm starting to think it's actually in the 
transmission--probably the differential.  :(  When I coast to a stop (no 
breaks, in neutral) I hear a whiney/grindish &quot;chirp, chirp, chirp, 
chirp, chirp&quot; (about five chirps per second as the bus gets close to 
stopping).

I'm going to have a look at the fluid tomorrow.  Hopefully it just needs 
to be topped off, and all will be good in the world (not that I'm 
expecting that to be the case).

If you come up with any other idears, please let me know.

Jonathan

&gt;Hi Jonathan,
&gt;Sounds like a hard one to find. Checking the trans will be hard, about the
&gt;only thing you can do is lift both wheels off the ground and spin the
&gt;wheels. If it's in gear, the opposite wheel will spin in the opposite
&gt;direction when you turn. Things will need to be very shagged to notice
&gt;anything that way. This also only checks the differential and out put
&gt;bearings, not the rest of the internals.
