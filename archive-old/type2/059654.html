 &gt; So I just learned what a new expensive bus sound sounds 
&gt; like. A cracked head sounds like loud valves on one 
&gt; side, or maybe like an exhaust leak. 

Hey! I know that sound.  My motor was making that sound just yesterday  
YECH!!!

&gt;By exhaust valve #2.

Yep. That's about where my noise is coming from.  I dragged its sorry
carcass into the garage yesterday afternoon and will start dismantling
soon.
Good luck w/yours.  I'll probably be venting soon enough.
