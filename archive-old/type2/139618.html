Subject: Re: [T2] Hard Starting - Update 3

Jason,


Pleeeease go back thru the archives and look at the discussion on battery 
cables.  If ya want it to last &quot;forever&quot;, then do *not* get the leaded 
type cables, but the newer &quot;lighter&quot; clamp type...just go look at any 
&quot;modern&quot; car to see what I mean.

I have one on my negative side(with *two* ground connections tothe frame) 
and one on the positive side....they cost a little more, but I guarantee 
they are worth it!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; The Hard Starting saga continues!  This morning it was rainy and 50 degrees, 
&gt; so I went out and tried to fire up the Bus, and it started on the first try! 
&gt;   The last 5 mornings I've tried, the air temp has been below 50 (sometimes 
&gt; as low as 25F), and the engine has been sluggish to start.
&gt; 
&gt; So, my current theory is that the colder temps make the battery weaker and 
&gt; the 15W-50 oil thicker, and the combination of the two produces a no-start 
&gt; condition -- slow starter pushing thick oil just can't quite spin fast 
&gt; enough to kick it over.
snip
&gt; 
&gt; Step 2, replace old (original) battery cables with new ones.
&gt; Step 3, be rid of this starting problem FOREVER!
&gt; Hey, I can dream, right?  I'll keep y'all posted...
&gt; 
&gt; Best,
