Subject: RE: [T2] POR-15 and TK---

The baby food jar or any other vessel  isn't even necessary--

Just put the half full--or half empty can into the reefer--

Same with paint hardener.
Put the left over amount in the ice box--and it's good till the next
time you want to use it.
The cold causes the stuff to lay dormant--nothing to do with the air in
the container--Honest-- it works.

Been doing this money saving method for 20 years.


 
Regarding putting a bit in a baby food jar and putting the jar in the
refrig: I thought it was the AIR in the half empty POR 15 can that
caused the skim to form. 
So if you put a big stone in the can to make up for the POR 15 that was
removed, you could store it in its original can for a longer time. [I am
sure this was brought up before]. 
It makes sense that the baby food jars would not skim out if they were
filled to the rim, without regard to the refrigerator's effect.
