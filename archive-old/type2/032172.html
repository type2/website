Hello fellow listeeees,

	I live in Stony Brook on Long Island and  I attend SUNY Stony
Brook.  This December I purchased a 72 campmobile from a fellow LiMBO
member in Brooklyn.  The bus was originally from the northern Texas
southern Oklahoma area and has spent the past 13 years of its life in the
great salty northeast.   Okay so, i purchased the bus so my friend and I
could travel around North America for about eight months before I go to
grad school for chemistry (I want to get a Ph. D. in organic chemistry).
I have lost a few close family members so I wanted to take a year off
before I go to grad school and do a little bit of soul searching.
So i have been preparing the bus for the long road trip, doing the usual
body work (some rust and a coulple dents) and engine tune ups -- I'm
green with both but it's great to just.  Since it's
Friday I thought that I might ask the list if anybody has done a long trip
like this and if so, if anybody  would like to give me some of the
experiences
they had -- like what to do or not to do.  Also, if there is any other
advice or great stories that people would like to share with me the would
be great too.
Hope everyone has happy travels

&quot;If there is one room with a sealed door and three light switches on the
outside, how does one find out which light switch turns on the light by
only opening the door once and only having one light switch on when you
open the door&quot;
