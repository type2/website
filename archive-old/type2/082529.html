CR, (and everyone)

Sears sells a 24&quot; long, 1/2&quot; drive flex-head breaker bar. Last time I
bought one they were (just slightly) less than $20US.  If you leave your
driveway without one of these and a 6-point 19mm socket, you are not just
asking for trouble, you are begging real hard.

No matter how hard they put the lug nuts on, if you stand on the end of a
24&quot; bar, you are exerting twice your weight in foot-pounds of torque.  A
100 pound person can exert 200 foot pounds of torque just standing still.
Bounce a bit and you can get up to 4-600 in intantaneous torques. If you
weigh 200+, as I do, you can shear off the stud!  I recommend holding on
to the drip rail as you do this as they can let go rather suddenly.

This question (and other in the past) have gotten me thinking.  In a
desperate situation, what would be my *minimum* tool kit.  Say you were
going out in a friend's mini-cooper to rescue your bus from an unknown
breakdown. IMHO, the minimums you need to be on the road are:

Minimum Tools:
1/2&quot; drive flex bar
3/8&quot; drive ratchet
sockets, 1/2&quot; drive - 17mm, 19mm (6 POINT!!!!)
sockets, 3/8&quot; drive - 6-19mm
6&quot; long 3/8&quot; drive extension
combination wrenches - 6-19mm
phillips screwdrivers - #1 &amp; #3
flat blade screwdrives - one small (1/8&quot; blade) and one large (1/2&quot; blade)
Vice Grip - model 12LC (get the real one) and model 4LN (needle nose)
leatherman tool
multi-meter
feeler gauges

Minimum Supplies:
quart of oil
can of Kroil
roll of duct tape
roll of electrical tape
zip-ties

Minimum Parts:
points
condensor
fan belt

There are lots of other things that are handy, and I travel like Lewis
Carrol's white knight, but this is the absolute minimum in my book.  Any
other opinions? What have I forgotten?  Duplicated?

Thing I considered and rejected:

wire terminal kit - handy, but you can wrap, tape and crip bare wire
temporarily

wire - in an emergency, I can salvage wire from a secondary circuit

match solder - gosh, I was tempted, but it is just not reliable enough :-(

bulbs - one of any will get you home (one headligh, one tail light, etc.)

hydraulic jack - this is minimal for me, but I figured I would catch a lot
of flack :-) (and the VW jack *almost* works!)
