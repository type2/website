Subject: Re: Temp sensor wire

The temp sensor is screwed into the head, the tin should NOT be 
attached to the sensor. The tin can be removed with the sensor in 
place but it is easy to cut the wire.  You should be able to push the 
tin against the head and unscrew the sensor through the tin (it won't 
like it but it should come off).
Bend the tin back into position later.
After I got my tin off, I carefully enlarged the hole in the tin to allow 
a proper sized socket to fit through the tin and over the sensor to allow 
removal with the tin in place.

&gt; I'm trying to get the tin off my '80 engine and I'm stuck with the top piece
&gt; where the temp sensor goes through to the head.  Anyone know how this sensor
&gt; attaches to the head under the tin?  I'm trying to decide how to remove this
&gt; rusty-welded fitting from the tin without too much damage to the connection
&gt; underneath.  Any ideas?
