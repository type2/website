Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door woes

Remove the exterior channel cover to expose the rear roller and glide bushing.
Remove the lower roller assembly. Support the door before it drops on your foot.
Remove the roller from the pin in the upper channel.
Lift the door out of the  rear catch. Then remove the lock assembly.

&gt; Hi All
&gt; 
&gt; I have a little big problem.
&gt; I have a 74 westie. The sliding door won't open now.
&gt; The problem is the cable going to the lock near the rear hinge
&gt; is broken. It is broken inside the lock itself (not outside the lock).
&gt; Is there a way to jimmie the lock to release to open the door?
