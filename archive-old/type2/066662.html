Drag him to court!  No, I'm just kidding.  But I think if you have a 
strong court then you should go for it.  Don't worry about him fixing it 
again- you can do that yourself, but I say teach him a lesson or at 
least get it official and maybe others who have been burned by him will 
come and back you up.  Believe me, people know when they're getting 
cheated and they'll fight it if they think they have a chance.  I wish I 
had any proof my *former* mechanic was breaking things every time he 
went into fix something else.  It was so convenient that I would have to 
bring it back to HIM to fix what he just broke!  Argh!
