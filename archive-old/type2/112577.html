Hi,

Was the bus running before you replaced the cold start valve?

I would recommend you review all the vacuum connections, perhaps you 
dislodged something during the repair.

Richard Atwell has an excellent FI vacuum reference online at:

Happy trails,

&gt; Well I changed out my cold start vavle, It was toast (literaly burned 
&gt; up),
&gt; the screw were loose and looked as if it leaking fuel on the manifold. 
&gt;  Anyway,
&gt; my question is, since my bus won't start still,  Can i check my timing
&gt; eventhough the bus isn't running?  tonight I am going to adjust valves 
&gt; and attempt
&gt; setting points, Never done this before.  Pretty EZ?
