&gt;1. The O-Ring goes inside the flywheel.

Yes. be sure to clean out the old gunk that's in there first.

Don't forget the pilot bearing felt:

&gt;2. I will pry out the old rear seal, put a little 
&gt;engine oil on the new seal, put a piece of wood over
&gt;it
&gt;and gently tap the wood with a hammer to seat the
&gt;seal.
&gt;Sound right?

Sometimes it takes many blows if the bore is nice and tight. Be sure your strinking surface is not marring and you'll need a dead blow hammer.

&gt;3. I'm not sure where the gasket/washer goes. It's
&gt;metal and has the 5 holes so I am assuming it must go
&gt; between the flywheel and the engine. Right?

Like so (under the bolts):

&gt;I'm going to check for leaky oil galley plugs at the 
&gt;same time. I can't pressurize the engine with it out
&gt;so
&gt;I am hoping any leak will be obvious.

It won't. There is normally quite a bit of oil and gunk back there that makes it hard to determine if you plugs are leaking. If you can't pressurize the oil galleries, the next best thing would be to use the starter (via transmission) to check the engine on the floor in your garage.
