Subject: Re: [T2] oil filler tube  grommet

&gt;has anyone come up with some magic replacement for the NLA rubber grommet
&gt;that goes around the oil filler tube on a type IV?  This is where the tube
&gt;goes through the rear engine tin and it keeps hot exhaust air from getting
&gt;sucked into the fan.  tx, g

Auveco is a wholesaler of lots of generic car parts like grommets and trim 
screws and snaps and etc.

Look through their catalog and find a piece of rubber that slips over the 
edge of the metal and then use that to make a grommet. Glue the ends 
together so it doesn't shrink and create a gap.
