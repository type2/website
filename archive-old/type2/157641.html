Subject: Re: [T2] new generator brushes fail

I hear you, Mark.  I've known shops that wouldn't buy from a supplier that didn't pay labor claims on failed parts.  Luckily, the company I worked for did so.  But for customers that bring their own part, too bad.  Sometimes you just have to pay the price.  Cheers...KR


hey Jack  welcome to the club  new does not mean better or even  good 
anymore. hardest part is telling a customer that his new part has failed  and that it 
isn't the installers fault :) Later mark d
