Aarmored calvary regiment?

cal*va*ry
1.A sculptured depiction of the Crucifixion. 
2_dot_calvary A great ordeal. 

cav*al*ry
1.A highly mobile army unit using vehicular transport, such as light armor
and helicopters. 
2.Troops trained to fight on horseback. 

Sorry. . . One of by big pet peeves. It's one of those words like &quot;anemone&quot;
that most people mis-pronounce AND mis-spell.

&gt;it's off subject, but the Army's largest stockpile of
&gt;chemical warfare weapons is at the Deseret Chemical
&gt;Depot in Utah's west desert, about an hour from Salt
&gt;Lake. BTW, since 9/11 it's been surrounded by a
&gt;armored calvary regiment.
