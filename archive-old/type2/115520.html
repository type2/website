Subject: smelly noisy brakes

I recently got my bus back from impound (expired registration) they towed it 
by the front wheels. Now my brake pads (which are new from before this trip 
from NC to NJ) have started squeling sometimes. When I push on the brakes it 
goes away. It is not there all the time, but enough to make me concerned. 
When we stop you can really smell it too. It is definitely coming from the 
wheels. It didn't do this the first half of the trip before I got towed.
Any ideas?
Thannks,
