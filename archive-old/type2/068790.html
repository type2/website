&gt;Hell, I really can't go with this at all.  I figure that if you've got
&gt;something as beautiful as a vintage bus, then you want to keep it
&gt;beautiful; well, maybe that's just me...?
&gt;
&gt;If you keep your bus lloking like shit, you obviously don't take a great
&gt;deal of pride in it, or respect for it...if you don't respect your bus,
&gt;then why do you subscribe to this list...?
&gt;
&gt;OK,OK, enough...flame me if you must...go on!

THANK YOU!

I feel the same way! Her Majesty is beautiful and the idea of trashing 
her to make unattractive to theives is beyond me. Glad you had the guts 
to post that!
