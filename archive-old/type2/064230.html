On a recent purchase of a plug gauge for a Underwriters Laboratory
test I needed to perform at work, I got a quick lesson on gauges for
tool &amp; die work.  Gauges, such as a plug gauge (a plug gauge is a
cylinder of hardened metal that has a diameter with a specific size,
to a certain tolerance) have various tolerances, depending on the 
application.  Most sets have a size accurate to tenths, such as
the one I picked up:  .5292.  This would normally be a .529 bore
gauge, but it is .0002 oversized.  And why?  For determining a 
slip fit for a pin that would be .5290.  Two tenths oversize is
common for a very clean slip fit, such as a ground out hole (jig
bored, jig ground) or a wire EDM cut hole (a very cool method of
cutting metal with a wire electrode, accurate, in most cases, to
tenths or millionths!).  This gauge was accurate to 5 millionths,
and cost $2.50 for one gauge.  All this is useful in tool design, 
and in making machines.  And what is 
an engine?  A machine, with tolerance requirements that run the
gamut, from loose (engine tin to cylinder head clearance) to moderately
tight (valve clearance, bearing clearance).  Tenths don't really
seem necessary, since the engine was designed to wear, and tolerances
for engine bearings, valve lengths, brake drums, etc are given in
a range of thousandths (see Bently).  Just the act of turning your
engine on for a minute will cause all the dimensions of the valves,
bearings, rods, engine tin to change from a few tenths to several
thousandths, depending on the location, heat concentration, and
material.  OK, enough rambling...just a little info I recently learned.
