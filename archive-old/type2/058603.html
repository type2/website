Okay everyone:
&gt; Honestly.
&gt; How fast do you drive your bus?

hey hunter - like you, i drive a good ol' '78 westy, and never feel compelled to run it past &gt;&gt;65mph&lt;&lt;. i live in texas and drive those flats, and it's not much to look at...but you're in a bus, on the road, and that's all that really matters.
