.
&gt; Has anyone had any
&gt; experience with these Yokohamas ? Is there another tire I should
&gt; consider ?

Want to fix your busses instability?

Try: Michlin -Agilis 185 75 R 14 C

I've installed them  on 4 diffrent busses, now., with KYB gas adjust shocks.
This combination gives outstanding stability, with a definite improvement in
handling.  About $100 each *including new stems &amp; balancing*. from Discount
Tire Co.....
