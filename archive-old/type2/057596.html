Subject: Single cabs and crew cabs in Europe

Someone wrote and asked about single cabs and crew cabs in Europe.  I don't
live there now, but I did live in Germany in the mid-70's and again in the
mid-80's for a total of over 5 years.

Our drink man delivered beer, soda and mineral water to the door twice a week
in his single cab.  All the products were under the canvas cover on hoops in
the back.  You left your empties on the porch, and he would leave the same
quantity as a replacement.  If you wanted more or less, you just left a note.
He would collect from you every week or two, whenever he found you at home and
was in the mood to stop.  No pay in advance required.  Same principle as the
milk man 40 or 50 years ago in the U.S.  Can you imagine a system here leaving
cases of beer on your front porch?  Can you imagine how much would be there
when you got home?

The double cabs were used almost exclusively by work crews.  The guys who
repaved the sidewalk on our street, with paving stones, one at a time, had a
crew cab.  The laborers arrived every morning riding in front, with their
tools, as well as their lunches and beer for the mid-morning and mid-afternoon
beer breaks in the back.  If it was raining, they just sat in the back and had
2 or 3 beers at 10am and 2pm, then back to work. 

I was in Haiti in 1995 and 1996 helping the U.N. &quot;save democracy&quot; or at least
save Clinton's efforts at trying to appear to be a world leader.  The most
common similar vehicles are the nasty little smoke-belching deisels from
Daihatsu.  The bus version is used by their owner's to haul upwards of 25 or
more people on ad hoc bus routes, including the extra 4 or 5 hanging onto the
rain gutters and back bumpers.  The single cab version is exactly the same
principle was the VW.  It's the most common kind of pickup truck, probably
out-numbering the rust bucket Chevys that find their way from Miami.  I assume
it's the same in the rest of the Caribbean.  Altogether it's a very sensible
design and one that was only killed here by the bureaucrats.
