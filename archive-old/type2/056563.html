Subject: Re:Pre-drilled Sump Plate

Travis,
  I think someone on the list, mentioned a couple of weeks ago that the sump
or the oil change cover plate on porsche engines is predrilled for oil temp
sender unit.  Perhaps you can find one a a junkyard.  Just a thought.
                                                                Janyce
'71 Hardtop (not a pop-top) camper.  Kind of like shaken (not stirred).
