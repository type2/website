Craig,

It's not so bad if you do it with the engine on the stand!

When I was poorer and ahd fewer &quot;proper&quot; tools, I did it this way.

Made the lifters line up properly vertically(not on center).
Then used the test push rod tube so that at half lift the stems and 
the business end of the adjusting screw were &quot;square &quot; with each other.
You can make one of these easily.


Once I had that down, I thought I was set....but nooooooo...how ya gonna 
cut those little chrome molly turkeys(and cut them straight)?  Looked 
around and realized I had no lathe....hmmm...!light bulbs!  But I did 
have a table saw and a pair of blades that were supposed to cut *anything*.

Mounted one up, took a practice cut just to see and bingo!  perfect!

The rest is left as an exercise for the student&lt;grin&gt;....I was carefull to 
slide them all the way thru from the front of the blade to the back and 
cut the four for one side  and then do the whole test again for the other 
side.

Beware the blade changing thickness as you push them thru!

Cleaned the edges up, got my 2 lb brass hammer, and carefully pounded the 
new end into the push rod .  I had a 25lb flat lead ingot that 
someone gave me long ago and once I drilled an oversize partial hole to 
hold the other end of the push rod, I was done!

Cheers, dave

   lowering the CR is fairly easy - take off the cylinders, and put in 
&gt; and viola: it gives the size spacer needed for desired CR.

&gt; THEN you get to screw around with valve geometry, which is my next 
&gt; kettle of worms :P
