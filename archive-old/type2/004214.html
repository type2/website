Subject: Hot starts
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

My '70 Bus has devoloped this annoying habit of not starting when the
engines warm. The starter turns it over as nicely, there's plenty of fire at
the spark plugs, and there's fuel to the carb. If you get out and push it
bump starts easy enough and it'll keep running until you shut it off again.
So far I've checked (not listed in order) the coil, condenser, fuel pump,
starter, checked for vapor lock and everything else I can think of short of
taking the carburator apart (because it was rebuilt 6 months ago and this
problem just started) all to no avail. My brains cramping up on this one any
ideas? Thanks
Ken Nelson
