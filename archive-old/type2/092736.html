Good advice.  I *always* and I mean always use redundant supports if I'm 
under the bus or any vehicle.  It's amazing how many people I see trusting 
their very lives to a floor jack or a $20 jackstand.  I even take grief 
from my friends over this, who think that a pair of jackstands under one 
end of the vehicle is adequate.  Jackstands can fail, and the vehicle can 
slip off of them - you need something to protect you in case this 
happens.  I usually leave the jack under the vehicle *and* put a wheel or 
two under the frame as a last resort since the jack and jackstands can all 
tip over together.  Go ahead and make fun of me, I don't care.  I figure 
having my spine crushed and slowly bleeding to death would not be a good 
way to go.
