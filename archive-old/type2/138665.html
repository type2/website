Subject: Re: [T2] HEAD LEAKS

&gt;From: Jack Hattaway

&gt;Don't these metal gaskets go between the cylinder and the case?

&gt; &gt; I thought this was the article.

Well yes that is what I implied sorry. From my own experience I would say 
they are better suited there and a bare cylinder to head combo is best. Lapp 
the heads and cylinders together as suggested before. You should not have 
any problems this way as long as your parts are straight before you begin.

Good Luck,
