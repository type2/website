&gt; Hi George;
&gt; 
&gt; I had to install a Brazilian Solex 30/31 carb when my 1600SP engine was
&gt; re-rebuilt a couple of years ago, and had similar good results right out of
&gt; the box.  I haven't fiddled with jets at all.  My tailpipe indicates its
&gt; running a tad rich, but the plugs look OK and I'm getting ~21MPG on freeway
&gt; runs at 60-65MPH [true/corrected].

Not bad!  I get about 18-20 for highway touring at 60 or so, fully loaded
(which is about what a westy would be empty).  My pipe is dark black too,
but it runs so well that I don't want to mess with it.

  The bus is a '70 poptop Westy.
&gt; 
&gt; My only real complaint is that it has a tendency to seep fuel from various
&gt; joints and apertures.  Not very much, just enough to discolor the outside
&gt; and make its presence known.

Mine too.  I noted while disassembling it that many of the fasteners
weren't all that tight (and I'm not a strong-arm type myself) so perhaps
it'll be a bit tighter now.
 
&gt; My guess would be that the foreign material you found in your carb was
&gt; already there when you bought it, an artifact of the manufacturing/assembly
&gt; process.

Perhaps, but I'm rather surprised that it took several thousand miles for
the fibers to migrate to that jet, and then arrrived there all at once.

&gt; Did you have a rebuild kit for the 30/31, or just carefully re-use the
&gt; original gaskets, etc.?  I have a couple of kits for Solex 28 through 34
&gt; PICT carbs, and the gaskets in them don't look like they'll fit the
&gt; Brazilian unit.  I had a couple of kits for the 28-34 carbs, but didn't
use them, so I didn't really compare anything.  My goal was to change as
little as possible so as not to mess with a good thing.  I've discovered
that changing the float valve is a sure way to mess up the float level, as
the replacements are always a bit different than the originals.  I end up
carefully sanding down a too-thick washer to get the proper float level.
since I don't even have specs for the 30/31 I really didn't want to go
there if I didn't have to.  If Ronnie or other friendly suppliers are
looking in, how about posting the specs (jetting, float level, accelerator
pump output, etc.) for the 30/31 carbs? 

&gt; &gt; I've written before about FRAM's marine [gasoline] fuel filter, with
&gt; replaceable cartridge and drain tap for water removal.  Another filter I've
&gt; used on marine engines, including outboards, has a clear Pyrex tube body,
&gt; metal end fittings, and a replaceable filter insert.  These come in
&gt; different models for different fuel line sizes, and are usually available at
&gt; Schuck's, etc.  These also trap water, and have a much finer filter medium
&gt; than the typical
&gt; plastic-bodied inline filters.

I've seen the glass filters and always wondered if they were good or a
gimmick.  I'll have to give one a try.

I'm currently using a filter for a Japanese car that replaces the in-line
filter nicely, but I fear that it isn't really made to work in the
up-and-down line configuration.
