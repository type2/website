Subject: Re: [T2] '76 FI died - update

&gt; Situation: Cold weather, but '76 started immediately and warmed up for 5
&gt; minutes, unattended;
&gt;
&gt; I drove the '76 1/2 miles and then it stalled 3 times, one after the other
&gt; [top speed 25 mph, caught in gear each of the 3 times but it would not
&gt; continue running.  This was over about a 200 feet distance];
&gt;
&gt; I coasted to a stop along side the curb, and then the '76 only briefly
&gt; started 3 times [like just the cold start valve kicked in, only seconds each
&gt; time.  I could not get it to keep the run going];

sure sounds like a clogged fuel line or filter
&gt;
&gt; Finally,the '76 will not even kick over, even with a fresh battery.

can you turn the engine by hand.  wrench on the alt bolt etc.??
&gt;
&gt; If it is the starter system, why did it continue to die on the road??

maybe a wire or terminal broke on either the plus or ground to the
tranny/starter
&gt;
&gt; If it is a fuel pressure problem, why won't the starter kick over??

not sure what you mean by the starter won't kick over,  will the engine
crank??  will the starter solenoid click??
&gt;
&gt; If it is a low CCA powered / low voltage battery, why didn't a fresh battery
&gt; do something??

don't think this is the problem
&gt;
&gt; And even with no vacuum, the starter should kick over, right??

it should crank yes,
&gt;
&gt; OK, any thing else??  Like the FI system dual relay, [but why NOT kick
&gt; over??]

the starter should crank unless
no power or engine seized...  check the engine seized part first.

good luck
Bob
