&gt; The only strange thing is, if I disconnect the vacuum hose, and advance it
&gt; with centrifugal only, it is exactly the same- it reaches 30 the same, and
&gt; every setting is the same whether the hose is on or off. It behaves much like
&gt; an 009, to tell you the truth. The vacuum advance hose fits tight and doesn't
&gt; appear to leak. The bus runs well, no problem there.
&gt; Anyone have any comments? Hopefully I haven't bought the wrong dizzy?

Vacuum increases with load, not engine RPM.  To measure full vacuum advance,
you'd have to do it while driving or on a chassis dyno.
