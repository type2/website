&gt; This afternoon, I was replacing both of my batteries, and noticed a
&gt; scratch in the paint in the engine compartment.
&gt; I curiously got close to the scratch, and noticed a yellow-green color
&gt; under the paint.
&gt; 
&gt; Ah,Ha !!
&gt; 
&gt; VW had actually used a zinc laden primer under their paint !
&gt; 
&gt; Amazing !!!
&gt; 
&gt; I am shocked as well as appalled, that VW had the tenacity to use this
&gt; type of primer, and to think that it has managed to last 27 years
&gt; without turning to dust.

27 years ago zinc-laden paint was the state of the art. No wonder VW had the
&quot;tenacity&quot; to use it.
