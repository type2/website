&gt; Aviation gas was yet another color.

Aviation gas is colored according to the octane rating:
Red is 80, blue is 100, clear is 100LL, purple is 130.
(memory might be a bit flaky on these, though)
Big problem is that turbine fuel is also clear, though it smell
different.  Lineboys can sometimes make mistakes, which can ruin your
whole day if the turbine fuel hits the carburator about the time the
wheels break ground.

Bus content:  Don't run avgas in a bus unless you like hard starting!
