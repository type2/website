Subject: Re: [T2] Type 1 engine Alternator Wiring instead of Gen....
  Solved???

I wired up the alternator with basically only 2 wires going to it from the
bus wiring.
B goes to battery positive
And I spliced the gen warning light into one of the wires going into the new
regulator.

The new regulator has no designations at all, but did have colored wires.
I wired them according to the Bentley from the 72 wiring diagram.
The wires were red, green and brown.

This seems to work.  i.e. The gen light comes on when key is turned and goes
out after running a second.

It makes absolutely no sense to me as it seems the wires going to alternator
dead end at regulator.  We shall see if it actually works in a few days when
the battery either dies or keeps going.

Thanks for all the tips,
Snoopy
