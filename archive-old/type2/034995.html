Subject: Re: Ruminations on heating a VW bus while camping

&gt;My brain keeps straying over into this topic. Since all my neighbors have
&gt;Caddies or SUVs (or both) and stay in fancy hotels, it's no use talking
&gt;to them, so I'll think out loud here.

Very easy solution:

I think it was Nikki who saw one of these already installed on a bus in a
salvage yard.  I just purchased a small tent camper that came from Colorado
with a propane furnace installed.

The furnace is very small, about 12&quot; square and maybe 20&quot; long.  It needs
to be vented to the outside, so a small hole needs to be cut to the outside
for the vent.  The furnace has it's own thermostat so it can be set at what
ever temp you want.

The warm air is channeled around the combustion chamber, so no (or at least
an extremely small) chance of any carbon monoxide inside the bus.  The
combustion chamber uses fresh air from the outside.

You will need to carry a propane tank with you, but then you could use the
propane for other purposes as well.

There is no need to cut the bus for duct work as you would with a gasoline
heater.

The blower is 12V, but as in a house forced air furnace, the blower only
works when the furnace is running.

And the best part is, you can buy one of these used at an RV dealer for
less than most gas heaters at swap meets!  And the installation takes half,
or less the time, not to mention these are easier to work on and get parts
for.

If you have a westy, just put one in the lower cabinet, you will loose a
little storate space, but gain warm toes and nose all night long!
