You know, I'm looking at the color chips here, and I think you are 
right. I don't see a black van. Someone must have painted it up special 
for a customer (some delivery models, I read, were shipped in white 
primer).

Recognized colors were various shades of Blue, Green, white, grey, 
Brown, and &quot;Sealing Wax&quot; &amp; &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Titian&quot; reds... and there it is, 
March 61 thru July 64, Turqoise w/ a Blue White top. Funny, I've seen a 
lot of VWs around, but it's only at the car shows that I've ever seen 
one painted that color (it seems to be the kewl color of the day).

I just saw a 59 today, painted solid red from the factory (repainted 
white on the exterior by PO). The dash was more of a red/orange color.
