                                Day Two: Yuma to Tucson

4. Waking up in a world full of birds

Yuma was my first time sleeping in Peregrine, my 1976 bus. For the past 
nine months I have wondered: feet toward the hatch? Head toward the 
hatch? Should I ask the list? Nah...

Wednesday night I tried feet by the hatch first. Closed my eyes. Well, 
that settles that. I reverse myself. Head by the hatch. Close my eyes. 
Ah, that's it. I sleep fitfully, but in surprising comfort, and awaken to 
the sound of a cactus wren. No, not a cactus wren. More like a 
mockingbird imitating a wren. And then a rooster. I stay tucked into my 
sleeping bag, but sit up (ducking to miss the overhead shelf), and reach 
out to click on my butane burner for coffee. I want to drop back on the 
bed while I wait, but it takes so little time to boil water that I just 
wait, pulling a curtain aside with one finger to survey the scene. By 
now, there is light, revealing an RV park overrun by hens, roosters, and 
chicks. Now that's something I never got to see at the Best Western.

The whistle announces hot water; I make coffee, still wrapped in my 
sleeping bag. It's a little on the chilly side. Not cold, but not warm 
enough to leap out of the bag. While I sip my coffee, my vision less 
blurry, I look over the scene inside the bus. First, I knocked over two 
drinks the day before -- a cup of coffee and an open bottle of orange 
Gatorade -- and these now stain the floor. Second, though I have designed 
an interior that could be kept shipshape, it is currently nothing of the 
kind. I set about tidying up everything I can reach without getting out 
of my sleeping bag, which turns out to be a lot.

I make another cup of coffee, and pull on a shirt from the overhead 
shelf. Next I slip out of the bag, pull on my pants while bent at the 
waist (I didn't pop the top the night before), then fold back the 
Westy-hinged bed.  I sit, pull the curtain open and leave it there, gaze 
out the window at the hens.

Someday, I will take these details for granted. This morning, though, 
they are new. New as reality, that is -- I have daydreamed about it for 
months. And I find that all my expectations have been met. This is the 
way to wake up on the road. No contest. 

Business. I have to drive from Yuma to Tucson, and I have to arrive in 
Tucson around noon. I will find the room where I will be giving my paper, 
and let the session organizers know I have arrived so that they can relaz 
(they know I am coming in an untested bus). So I shower, redress, batten 
down the contents of the bus, turn the key and press my starter button. 
Peregrine starts, does her cold start thing, and then begins to settle 
down to her alto and bass idle. The alternator light is on. Maybe it will 
go out when I get on the road and start cruising without lights. I pull 
out and retrace the route I followed the night before. Before I get to 
the highway, I gas up and check the oil. I calculate the miles per gallon 
since El Centro: 24 mpg! Oil's fine. I get on the 8 and head east.

Immediately, I am buffeted by the wind. A stiff wind is blowing at such 
an angle that were I sailing, I would be on my starboard tack. I sort of 
wish VW had designed a keel or at least a garboard into the type 2. But 
no -- I am the stabilizer, and I will work at it for the next four and a 
half hours. As I reach cruising speed, I listen for the buzzing sound. It 
is difficult to hear inside the bus, as it always comes with lots of 
rattling from the Coleman stove under the bed, the stove stand, and 
dozens of loose items. Yesterday I learned to stick my ear out the window 
a little bit to check for the buzz, and I follow suit today adjusting 
accordingly. There. Just right. On to Gila Bend.

Other than the wind, it is a perfect day. Saguaro cactus begin to appear 
east of the mountains beyond Yuma. They are swollen from recent rains, 
their pleats ironed almost smooth. The palo verde trees are in bloom, 
yellow flowers cover every tree. Ocotillo come and go, some grey and 
seeminly lifeless, some with green wands and red blossoms, twisted into 
Zen forms. I love the desert and I love especially the Arizona upland. 
It, and the Colorado plateau rising to the north, are the reason I needed 
this bus. As long as they are there, I will need my bus.

Hmm. Alternator light is still on. No, now it's off. Okay. Let's get to 
Tucson. I top up the tank in Gila Bend and recalculate the fuel economy 
I'm getting. Twenty-two miles to the gallon (as measured on the map, not 
by my odometer, which I do not yet trust). Oil is fine. Back on the road, 
the alternator light is back on. No, no, it's off. I cruise across 
through the heart of the desert, feeling mighty glad to be alive.

Two hours later the 8 joins the 10 south of Casa Grande. Still on 
schedule, I top up again. And then when I turn the key and press the 
button, nothing happens. I glance around for enough grade to clutch start 
the engine, and find that there is none. Damn. Damn damn damn. (I have 
given up the f-word, hoping that by doing so I can encourage my 16-year 
old son to follow suit.) I get out, open the engine hatch, and go through 
the ritual of wiggling every wire. Nothing makes a difference. But I have 
something going for me. I have chosen a real service station. Not a 
fuel-and-food center. I loosen up the battery, pull it out, and take it 
into the garage. The owner of the station gets out his charger, sets it 
on 20 amps, starts charging. The battery charges, and I pace. There goes 
my margin for error. I have erred. With each minute the battery charges, 
my margin is cut by an equal amount. 

I chat with the owner, who has owned or worked for one of four gas 
stations on this corner since 1972. A long time. Across the street, at 
the Love's station, I suddenly glance a yellow and white '76 bus. Same as 
my bus, but minus the rust. I is piggy-backed on a flatbed, though, and 
mine is not. Looks are for nothing; it's guts that get glory.

At long last enough time has passed on the charger that I think I can get 
to Tucson. So I wiggle and twist the battery back onto its tray, tighten 
the clamps, and start up. Headed south. I mentally compose a new 
introduction for my paper, with reference to my bus, as I am going to 
come in after the session begins. I choose a line, something like &quot;I wish 
to apologize publicly for arriving late -- I was developing an I-thou 
relationship with my VW bus.&quot; Soon I am in Tucson, find the Holiday Inn 
downtown; park; pull on my clean jeans, a button-down shirt, and a vest; 
walk into the session a few seconds before I am to begin my paper.

It goes well enough, and people come up to me after to reminisce about 
their beloved buses. I excuse myself. I have to find the  FLAPs.

5. That darned light

In the spirit of untarnished optimism, I have convinced myself that the 
regulator, not the alternator, is at fault for my charging problem. How 
else to explain the flakey light? I drive to the east side of town, pull 
into the VW parts store, and breath a sigh of relief when they have one 
regulator in stock. It doesn't look like the Bosch part, and that makes 
my heart skip a beat, but the plug is the same. I pay for it, take it out 
to the bus, install it. Turn the key. No light! Could it be the wrong 
regulator? Defective? I begin to steam, since there is no return on 
electrical parts. I choose to believe that although the light doesn't 
come on, the battery will nevertheless charge. I head out to have dinner 
and get ice. Soon, I notice that the sun is headed for the horizon. I 
should find a place to camp. 

I choose a place nearby from my campground guide and drive over. When I 
pull into the driveway and up to the gate, I see a sign that says &quot;55 and 
older.&quot; I wonder, can I fool them? What if they card me? Why didn't the 
book mention this. The bus stalls -- faced downhill at the gate just ten 
feet ahead. I press the intercom button and explain my plight. If they 
would just open the gate, I will pop the clutch, turn around, and drive 
right back out. &quot;Done&quot; says the disembodied voice over the intercom. The 
gate opens, I carry out my plan, and now I am headed for another RV park 
while the sun sets. I reach out with my left hand, pull on the lights, 
and suddenly the bus sputters. No power. 

Okay, it wasn't the regulator that was at fault. Or maybe this new 
regulator is bad. I pull into a Quik Shop and the bus stalls. I get out 
and follow a procedure that I have used all of my adult life in 
situations like this. Consider all the options, no matter how foolish 
some of them might be. The sensible option: call AAA and get towed to the 
second RV park, less than seven miles away. I call AAA. A recording says 
that I will be talking to someone human in three to seven minutes. Damn. 
That's more than enough time for me to begin taking seriously some of my 
less sensible options. Just then, a man in his thirties comes out of the 
Quik Shop and heads for his pickup. &quot;Say,&quot; I ask, &quot;would you mind giving 
me a jump start.&quot; &quot;Fine,&quot; he says and I commit myself to something at the 
outer edge of rationality. In a few minutes the bus is running. I am 
acting out one of my dumbest options -- drive the bus to the RV park with 
the lights off. I flash them from time to time, but for five miles I run 
with parking lights only. I pull up to yet another gate, the bus stalls, 
and I explain my situation over the intercom.

A security guard comes out, signs me up for the night, and agrees to give 
Peregrine a push with his truck to get her started. Then he leads me to 
my campsite, my lights out. All this is unexpected. I had expected 
hostility to the bus, reinforced by her unsightly outward condition. 
Instead, I am getting help and kindness wherever I turn. Remarkable. 

When the guard leaves, I pop the top. I haven't any canvas but with the 
top up the bus fills with desert night air. And I stand inside and survey 
the scene around me. RVs big, bigger, and biggest. And li'l old me. It's 
a long time before I can settle down and go to sleep. The world is too 
good to abandon it temporarily for sleep. But on the morrow, I have to do 
something about the alternator. There will be options to list and review. 
Head by the hatch, I drift off to sleep.

Next: RVer appears with a battery charger! No one complains!
