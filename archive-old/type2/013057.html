I would like to put the same 3 point seatbelts in the back of our 
camper as we have in the front.

If there is anyone on the list that goes to junkyards frequently, and 
you see a decent set of front seat belts, it would be appreciated if 
you could help me get them.

I would need all bolts and I could also use the passenger side 
bottom portion as I broke the plastic cover off of mine.

There are no junkers around here as I live north of the 60th parallel 
in Canada's Sub Arctic.

There are people on the list who have such easy access to junkers.
