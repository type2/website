Subject: Everybus 2k4

Hey y'all
EB04 is shaping up to be a good'n.  This morning's pancake breakfast was
a hit again, mucho thanks to the Canadians! 

There was 75 buses there this morning and more rolling in all the time. 
Weather's looking great for the rest of the weekend as well.  We don't
need any more folks coming though because by the time you read this,
it's probably Sunday night and you've just gotten back!  If you leave
Sunday afternoon there won;t be many folks there either so..... 
Seriously, a better camping weekend won't be found (except maybe
Oktoberbus).

Why am I writing this instead of camping?  Gotta work.  A 2 hour commute
(I wasn't gonna let the 4 letter word ending in 'K' stop me from going
to EB04).

Mad Uncle Dave
