Subject: Re: [T2] windshield replacement

Replace it - 20 year old seals aren't much good. I'd recommend West Coast 
Metric rubber. Been good for me.

If you are replacing the windshield I would simply push the glass out with 
your feet while you are laying in the front seat. Two people would make it 
easier. One or two people out front with gloves to catch it so it doesn't 
beat up the paint when it pops out. Push evenly and slowly. The glass will 
craze and crack but should not shatter.

With one person outside pushing in and two pushing out you can regulate the 
speed of the glass removal.

Use silicone spray if you want to lubricate the process. Doesn't hurt the 
metal, and the rubber likes it too.

If you are going to paint soon I'd recommend liquid soap. Paint and 
silicone are like oil and water and it take diligent cleaning to remove all 
traces of it.

&gt;ok guys, i have ordered my windshield here locally and
&gt;they are delivering it 150 bucks with factory uv and
&gt;tinted at the top, sounded like a good price to me.  i
&gt;have installed a flat bug windshield before and don't
&gt;think the bus will be that much different if it is
&gt;then tell me.  my question is that i will be taking it
&gt;back out in about a month, hopefull 2 weeks and i
&gt;wanted to know what was the best way to take it out
&gt;without ruining the seal?
