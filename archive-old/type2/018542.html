I don't know if this is the case with all engines, but my 2.0 Type IV
drove me to the brink of gobs of sealant - until I realized that the
inexpensive cork gaskets were wide enough that they fouled the rocker
arm pedestal on one end.  After cutting about a 1/8&quot; x 3/8&quot; notch out of
the inside edge of the gasket, I've not had a valve cover leak since.
