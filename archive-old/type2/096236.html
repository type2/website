absolutely those little pieces above the push rod tubes are critical

&gt; I am missing some engine 
&gt; seal in the compartment and some tin screws and a piece of tin under the 
&gt; pushrod tube. Would this cause the oil light to come on.
&gt; 

BUT the tin under the push rod tubes really only keeps stones etc from
hitting the push rod tubes and contribute nothing to the cooling of the
engine,  all the air is past the engine before that tin.  I have totally
removed the stock heating system from my 2L FI engine and that leaves no
place to screw that piece of tin to, so I have had them off for better
than 5 years with no effect on the cooling.

YMMV of course
