Subject: synthetics..........which one is it.????

ok ok ok ok ok everyone calm down.  i have been bombarded with an enormous
amount of mail.....the majority of which has been super positive and
inquisitive.  it seems most bus owners on here are always interested in
learning about a newer/different product.    i am going to set a few things
straight here in a general mail so as not to have to send it to everyone
individually how expressed interest.

first the name.  it is amsoil.  so if you are not interested after knowing
this dont read on.  amsoil and amway are IN NO WAY RELATED.   a guy named al
amatuzio started the company in 1972.  he decided that since the FAA ruled
that is was the law to only install and use synthetic oils in jet engines
there must be a reason for that.  ( to this day all jet engines are reguired
by law to use synthetic oils and greases.  this is not a baseless statement, i
work in the airline industry and know this to be true.)  back to the
story......he developed an oil that blew away the competition in performance,
metal particle shear factors, volitility, heat break down ...etc. etc.  heres
a fact to think about....take a qt. of your favorite oil and one of amsoil and
set them outside in the snow overnite.  open the caps and tip them upside
down....your regular one will be sludgy and thick ...while amsoil runs free.
take those same 2 qts. and heat them to 600 degrees.  yours will have began
boiling away in as little as 290degrees while amsoil synthetics stay complete
until reaching the 600 mark.  those are just to simply but extremely important
factors to consider in oil products.  i could go on and on....but you make
your own choice.  i personally would rather you use ANY synthetic than your
normal petroleum based oil.  it doesnt have to be the one i recommend.  the
worst synthetic is better than the best petroleum oil.  hmm...wonder why so
many car manufacturers are putting it in the engines and trannies from the
factory??  the catalog i can send allows you to order it direct from the
factory.  for $10 you can become a dealer and get it even cheaper yet.  i
became one years ago so i could get it at cost.  order about $25 on first
order and the $10 is not an issue.  they also make oil filters that are
incredible!! and air filters also.  dense foam filters that come with special
tacky oil.  why use a paper filter that traps dirt only on its surface??,
when amsoil filters are a thick foam depth filter that trap particle
throughout its mass!!!!  i have yet to have a single person use this product
and not be satisfied.  thats the truth.  did you know that by changing to
synthetics you save gas mileage also.  example....average syn.oil change cost
is about $40.  your gas mileage increases on an average of 2-3 mpg.  by only
increasing ONE mpg you save $72 a year.   hmmmm....that seems to me that
synthetics pay for themselves in that area alone.  it is unbelievable how
smooth the gear shift is on those cold winter mornings.  ONE NOTE OF
IMPORTANCE: synthetics are not to used in a car that does not have a filter (
spin on or equivalent )...syn. are a highly detergent oil.  in other words
they keep the engine spotless clean and remove sludge to be trapped by the
filter.  if you dont have a filter to catch it, it is a bad situation for you
motor.  so basicly in a stock bug with only the filter screen they are not
recommended.  you can still use the gear lube for trannies tho.   so if you
are still interested i will send you a catalog FREE  of charge, and answer any
specific questions you have.  i dont claim to know it all on oils but i hope
to impart some of what i ve learned with you .          and thanks again to
all who responded...........
