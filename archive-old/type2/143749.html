Subject: old wars

reminds me of the guy who asked me about MY bus. &quot;Man,
I thought you were all right, until I looked closer at
your bumper stick and it said &quot;BU(ll)SH(it) '04!&quot;

It's over...let's forget about it and get back to
being old hippies driving our buses (at least until
'08)!
