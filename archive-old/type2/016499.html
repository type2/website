Subject: snaps figured out FWIW

Hola All:

I had a deeper look at those snaps on the inside edge of the sliding
door sil tonight....

For those who thought it was for the tent, I have the tent, and there
aren't any snaps on it.....but thanks for the thought....actually
they're installed with a 1/8&quot; pop rivet, and there are 5 along the
molding up where the roof latch is...and a few more down the DS door sil
along the back edge....three holes along the front edge of the counter
top indicate there may have been some there too at one time....so I
think it must have been for a snap-on divider...nice idea...anyone got
any ideas on where to get one???

Does anyone know where I can find some over-riders for a late bay??

Keep on bussin'

Den.
