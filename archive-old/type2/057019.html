Subject: Re: Bus key chains

&gt;
&gt;In the Hearthsong (gaack!) catalog, they have die-cast metal bus
&gt;keychains in 1:87 scale (about 2 inches long).  They are kombi
&gt;splittys, and are available in green, orange, blue, and red (all with
&gt;white tops)
little gift for your favorite vehicle!

I have a similar item - keep it on my vw toy shelf!
It seems heavy key fobs or large amounts of keys on your chain are a good
way to ruin your ignition switch.
Apparently all that weight swinging around off the end of your key will
just chew the inside up.....

Not meaning to be a killjoy, just know what a bugger it is to replace the
damn thing.
