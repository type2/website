Subject: [T2]swaying(thanks solved)

well you all had many useful suggestions ..
went and had a engine swaping party saturday and well lets say my bus was worked into the assembly line...
 
my right tie rod was badly bent and my two front tires were almost fixing to pop...
how i had missed those tires being that bad i wil never know since i am like under the bus almost everyday how did i miss umm...
guess i fooled myself into thinking cause they were new that i didnt thave to check ummm. what a dissappointment right here before everybus.... and haveing to go buy two brand new tires to put on the front....someone lent me two bus tires til i got these this morning or am going to get shortly,....
 
the wire had came through one of them and was slowly getting the the other around the inside rims..
so the outside tread looked brand new....
 
tire would hardly stand up by there self they were so leaned...
 
brian(glassblower4u) had some expertise from welding school on how to get that tie rod straight and that he did.... looked really good... didnt have a bend in it at all.. ....
i have about 1-2 inches play maybe on left and right side of steerring wheel now and feels really good driving now.. feels balanced (need a front end alignment now) i can stay in my lane now which is important.. lol..
last thing we need is a swerving VW bus.... lmao..
 
once again thanks to you all...
peace
Cha
