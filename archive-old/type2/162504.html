&gt; Patrick,
&gt;          Are you aware of Maryland's 'Historic' plate category?  Your 79
&gt; vehicle is 25+ years old and should qualify.  You would not be subject to
&gt; emissions testing, IIRC.

limited to 5,000 miles a year.

&gt; Some years ago you gave me several VW parts (maybe a Bay windshield).  If you
&gt; need to borrow one, I have a 1970s era emissions tester, proctologist style.
&gt; Have not used it lately but it was working when put up on the shelf.  I am
&gt; across the Bay Bridge from you.

if he doesn''t want it I sure would love to be able to tune in my air/fuel
mix
