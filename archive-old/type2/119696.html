Subject: Sermons, Pulling Engine

Sermon page 466, Pulling the engine II  ,  Says;

    Their are only two kinds of Volkswagen owners, Those who have removed 
their engine, and those who are going to. 
    God give me the strength, patience and  unclog this clogged carburetor of 
a brain I have as I enter into this unexplored territory.
