And of course is there something I could hook up to my lights to beep when I 
turn off the car and they are still on?

PS.  On the barttery.  You do not need any receipt to return the battery.  
There is either [or both] a tag on the battery indicating the date code  it 
was made, or the date code is punched into the battery case.  If you are 
within a year of the date code, you should get a new, free battery.  Some 
batteries are free replaced for the first THREE years, other for 1.5 and 2.0 
years.  If the batterys is not free replaced in the FIRST 1.0 year, you 
don't want that battery anyways.

I took my battery back to WalMart within the first 12 months and they gave 
me another one, right across the return counter.  Just don't take it to a 
WalMart with a auto shop or they may test it!!

Sears charges $$$ to test the battery, unless it is a Sears battery.  The 
test is done by machine, so you can see the results over the shoulder of the 
mechanic.

Check other auto parts chain stores for the free service.  After my battery 
was determined dead by the auto parts chain store, I said 'thank you' and 
took it in to KlMart for a replacement  (Yes, KMart - the Walmart battery 
was good.  I EAT batteries for lunch!!!)
