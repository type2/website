In the grand canyon area there are plenty of places to stay _except_ on
the Navajo reservation.  Even in Shiprock, the capital of the Navajo
Nation, there wasn't a motel to be found.  Nearest place to stay was in
Farmington.  There are a couple of motels in Kayenta, but be sure to bring
your Visa card, and make sure the limit is high!  We ended up driving an
extra 150 miles to Flagstaff.

I generally let my wife pick the motels, but her criteria seems to be
this:

1. She doesn't like chains.
2. She threw out all the AAA tourbooks, because the motels have to pay so
much for the listing that their rates are invariably too high.
3. She looks for evidence of good maintainance.  She's not shy about
asking to look at a room before renting it.
4. Never stay in a motel near railroad tracks.
5. She likes small places, 5-20 units.
6. we never make reservations, as we never really know where we're going
to end up.
7. There is always another place to stay up the road.
