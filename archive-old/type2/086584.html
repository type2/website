Subject: Re: [T2] High temp. paints

I have used the Eastwood stuff and had crappy results,
too..............looked bad again after 6 months.

Best fix i use is BBQ grill paint......lasts 3-4 months and when it is
looking rough again, i give it a fresh coat.  Cheap and it works.

&gt; &gt;I have used this paint.  I put the silver POR20 on my exhaust.  You will
&gt; &gt;need to have an ultra clean as in grease free muffler for the paint to
&gt; &gt;stick.  Make sure you mix the paint well also as the substance of the
paint
&gt; &gt;is on the bottom of the can.  I did not super clean the muffler.  Just
wiped
&gt; &gt;it clean and sprayed it with ospho.  Then wiped it down again and painted
&gt; &gt;it.  It's been about 4 months and the silver is flaking off in places but
&gt; &gt;overall it is still on there.
&gt;
&gt; I've put the silver POR-15 on freshly sandblasted steel and frankly, in
&gt; the midatlantic, it was junk, utter junk.  I think the VHT aerosol stuff
we
&gt; used on Dolan's was far better, and I'm talking the difference of like OK
&gt; after one winter but not great (VHT) versus gone in a couple of fall
months
&gt; (POR-15).
&gt;
&gt; My experience at least, and I've tried it twice so as not to have just
gotten
&gt; a bad batch.  A friend used on of the other brand's stuff, maybe Eastwoods
&gt; gray and it has lasted well, so who knows.
