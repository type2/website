Subject: Manifold boots for Dual Port

OK, the darned things are cracked again.  I'm tired of replacing these
things at yearly intervals.  Does anyone know of a manufacturer of
intake manifold boots that can take the heat and gasoline exposure?  I
think that I had better luck the time that I wrapped the connections
with inner-tube rubber!
