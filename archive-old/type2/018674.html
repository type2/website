I'm having similar  troubles...(same settings, 7.5* BTDC)

I'm pretty sure that my chokes are working more or less properly, though I'm a
little unclear on how to set them. I tried aligning the mark on the round face
plate with the fat bump on the housing. That screwed the darn things completely
closed &amp; they wouldn't open at all. So I backed off the face plate until the
chokes close loosely &amp; open completely when warm. (Don't open evenly,
however...one spring is more taut than the other for some reason.)

My carbs backfire or otherwise flood the back of the bus with a gassey smell on
deceleration or &quot;coasting&quot; down hills with my foot off the throttle. And fuel
consumption seems poor (though not 2 liters in 10 minutes!!!).

I was able to get a nice smooth idle &amp; synch the carbs. Not so successful with
the idle mixture...it didn't seem to behave the way Muir &amp; Bentley seem to
predict. I tried opening the mixture screw until the engine reaches the maximum
RPM, backing the screw in until the speed drops by 30 RPM then open it a
quarter turn.

The problem I had was that the RPM would rise a bit, fall, rise a bit more,
fall, etc. I'm afraid that I simply have the mixture screw way, way too wide
open. Any ideas?
