&gt;..........Why not split the case and do it all?  It is
&gt; surprisingly simple in there.

An engine in the middle of it's service life needing
a minor repair does NOT necessarily have to be
completely rebuilt or replaced with a new engine.
Good oil pressure and compression are the key factors.
Crankshaft endplay tells a lot about the mains.
If there are NO specific defects in the bottom end,
it may continue to provide good service for a very long time.
Have the  $2.00 valve seat replaced and that head rebuilt.
Want to get fancy ? Do both heads. They probably both need it.
Replacing one head only will require matching compression
chamber volumes, this is what we call &quot;cc the heads &quot;.
You would be extremely lucky to buy a single matching
replacement head, so have yours measured and rebuilt.
Replacing lifters is tricky, you may need a cam, and for
that, &quot;Why not split the case and do it all ? It is surprisingly
simple in there &quot; :)....
