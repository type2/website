Subject: Curious: looking for my old incorrect yellow '79 westy
  (Michigan?)

Hi all, 
   Wondering if anyone on the list wound up with my old '79 Westy.  Was 
repainted before I got it, an incorrect light yellow color. Had a scrape down 
the passenger side where PO hit a sign or something. Had fair amount of rust 
underneath and in gutters under poptop, but still a driver.  
   Rumored to be in Michigan nowadays. 
   Just curious if it is still alive, sorry for consuming list bandwidth.
   Please email any replies offlist,
    Brian
