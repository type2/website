&gt; Thanks, John.  I hope it has a positive effect on performance,

&gt; addition will have a positive effect on the idle.

Don't even bother with the retard hose.  I left mine disconnected 
because my Bus ran so much better without it, timed to 7.5 BTDC.  
Smoother idle, better acceleration from stop signs, etc.

(My old dizzy needs to be restored, and I'm now running an ACN SVDA 
instead.)
