Subject: refillable spray cans

Gentlepersons-
                       ...Don't know about effectiveness/quality, but for 
those small touch-up
paint jobs on your Bus, Harbor Freight has a refillable spray paint can on 
sale for five
bucks. Might be the way to go after getting a supply house to match the paint 
and you
don't have to set up the compressor for just a few rust spots...
