Subject: Re: [T2] Battery Light

Sounds very accurate from my perspective.

Bad ignition switch?

I've had the &quot;start&quot; contact fail in a Beetle before.

Very small parts made of nylon. Last 30 years though.

&gt;it appears from looking at the schematic that the instrument panel is hot 
&gt;all the time when the key is turned on and when the oil switch comes on 
&gt;and grounds, it lights the light.  Likewise, when the generator is not 
&gt;charging enough, it the regulator grounds and that light comes on.  SO, it 
&gt;follows that the instrument panel must be staying hot all the time when 
&gt;the key is off, which would tell me that the electrical portion of the 
&gt;ignition switch has failed in someway.  Or is my logic all wrong?  Greg
