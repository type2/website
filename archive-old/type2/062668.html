Subject: paint it yourself

Thanks to all who responded to my question on compressed air. I now lust for 
an air compressor (to go with my new welder, maybe I'll open a garage) but 
am glad to know there are options.

Here's another compressed-air related question, kinda: How many of you out 
there have painted your busses yourselves (show of hands please)? How many 
of you who painted them yourself had never done such a thing before? After 
my carb's rebuilt, my cargo floor is all welded and about a million other 
things are done, I want a new coat of paint on my 70. I can't decide whether 
to go with a cheapo Maaco job or do it myself. This is a loaf, so I have no 
pretensions of future resale value (you know the ad: '68 bus, perfect, new 
paint, rebuilt engine, $8,000). I'm  just gonna drive the wheels off the 
thing.

So: DIY, or Maaco?
