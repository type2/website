Subject: Re: [T2] Transmission - interchangable years?

-- Original Message -----
  thanks for the reply Jamie - I have an additional question, if I decide to
leave the current tranny in the bus, its for a 1700cc and install my 2000cc
will it work ok or is the gearing that much different.  I've have received
info saying it will be ok..


  When you start to mix match trans,, engines and clutches.. you have to
figure out which is best or cheapest for you...

  dealing with a 74 body,, and a 2 liter engine..
  the trans and STARTER is built for a 210mm clutch set up...

  The 2 liter should have a 228mm clutch set up...

  It interchanges as long as you take all the parts..

  if you want use a 228 mm flywheel on the engine..
  you have to use the 091 bellhousing on the trans
  you have to use the SR87 starter
  you need the longer bolts

  If you put a 210mm flywheel on the 2 liter engine,, you can use the 002
bellhousing and SR15 or SR 17 Starter.


  091 transmission is late bay
  002 transmission is early
  starter information..

  as I said before

  Let me assume a few things,,   assuming you talking manual to manual
  transmissions... and assuming the po hasn't already interchanged things,,,

  I think you will find you can easily interchange the engine and the trans
from
  the 78 into the 74 body

  Things to think about...

  change out the transmission upper hanger as it has the correct throttle
tube
  welded in place for EFi
  put the 78 hanger in the 74  body.

  change out the shifter as it is a straight one instead of the bent one in
the 74
  put the 78 shifter in the 74 body

  you'll probably have to drill a new dimple in the hockey stick to allow the
  shifter to select 2nd and 4th ,, the new hole needs to be about 12mm towards
the
  trans nose cone... if you go toooo far back,, you won't be able to select
1st
  and 3rd... so make sure you put the hockey stick in 1st or 3rd and leave a
  millimeter or 2 clearance between the shift rod coupling and the nose cone
  bushing seal area.

  If you staying with carbs.. you will need to rejet them...

  If your going to EFi.. you'll need the throttle cable interchanged too. and
the
  Brake booster will need a vac line,, which is different between the 74 and
the
  78.. you can improvise pretty easily

  You will need to install an electric fuel pump... as the 74 had a
mechanical
  pump on the engine case.. and the 2.0 liter will not have that.

  Hope that helps
  Jamie Rivers
