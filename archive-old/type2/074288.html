&gt; Here, in So Cal +ACo-as in most of the US+ACo- the price for +ACo-lowest octane+ACo- regular
&gt; unleaded fuel is very low right now.
&gt; 
&gt; Question: +ACo-for those of you with  STOCK type 1 and/or type 4 motors+ACo- are you
&gt; using this lowest octane rated fuel in your bus, and if so with what
&gt; results?
