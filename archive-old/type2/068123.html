Subject: How to modify a V8 engine stand????

Hi All,
        A while back I bought a (V8?) engine stand from some guy
really cheap.  Its blue, has four wheel with a vertical bar at one
end, with a plate that fits/bolts into a tube at the top.  It has four
movable bolt-holes on the plate where you bolt the engine.  In a 2D
world it looks like this from the side:

                  -|   
                   |   =
                   |=====
                   |   =
                  -|   =
                       =
                       =
                       =
                       =
                       =
========================
  OO                 OO


My question is, how can I make this work with my type-4 engine case,
if at all?  I thought I remembered some thread (a long time ago) about
someone having something welded to make this work.  Anyone have any
ideas for me?  Thanks for any help!

take care,
        brandy
