Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Sighting

&gt; From: Jamie [mailto:jrivers_at_globalserve_dot_net]
&gt; The words Barn Door  refer to that engine hatch you described.... not to
the doors on the right or left side... those are cargo doors...

Oops, didn't know that.  Thanks.

&gt; A double door bus has cargo doors on the left AND the right side....
actually 4 doors make a Double Door Bus  The engine hatch that goes from the
beltline down is a Barn Door..

Thanks, Jamie.  I didn't notice in the movie if it had doors on both sides.
They all got out on the right side of the bus.

Does the barn door hatch open to just the engine compartment?  It looks huge
by comparison to my '77's hatch.  And I was wondering if there really was
room in there for that radio/remote thing?

- Mike
