Subject: vw recyclers in NC ??

 well the time has come to get rid of my wrecked bus.

i'd much rather see it go to a VW recycler than the
crusher or something. I have pulled off a lot of
parts, but there are still a bunch of parts left that
someone might like to find in a junkyard, so

does anyone know of a vw junkyard in NC that would
take the hulk off my hands??  do i pay them or do they
pay me??

thanks
