&gt;On that oil selection.
&gt;I decided to start using straight stuff after lengthy exchanges and
&gt;some research I did last year, just about this time, on the subject.

&gt;Discussions with some type 2 list people and phone calls to lube
&gt;techies helped me come to the decision of straight oil for Casper.

Just as a reference point, Bentley calls for straight 40 weight in 100
degree temps.  I still run 20/50 though - that's just the kind of guy I am.
