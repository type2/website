&gt; Steve,

&gt; I noticed you have a 1980 Westie just like me.  Mine
&gt; runs fairly well, but the idle speed is too slow when
&gt; first started (almost stalls), and too fast when hot. 

Tell me about it :-) Mine has the same problem and I have a couple of
other problems as well... I keep promising the poor beast that I will look
at it, but so far, I have just not had the time :-(  one of these days...
real soon now :-)

&gt; I would love to know a top notch mechanic in our area
&gt; who can diagnose this.  

METOO!! METOO!  The problem for me is that my V'gon is so &quot;custom&quot; that
mechanics don't really want to handle it.  I have a MSHP Stage 2 2.2L
engine wearing a mixed bag of FI systems (some '78, some '80, and some '81
bits)  a true nightmare!

Paul's VW repair in Annandale VA is the shop I use when I can't do it
myself... they are very good.

&gt; The adjustments for idle speed
&gt; and air/fuel don't seem to be doing much.  My idle
&gt; speed is screwed out 5.5 turns, the air/fuel was out
&gt; 13 turns but the screw vibrated loose and I almost
&gt; lost it, so now I have it out 10 turns.  As sloppy as
&gt; everything is. it's amazing I got it through
&gt; emissions.

The problem here is that those two adjustments are effective, but only for
what they do.  They cannot compensate for a bum head temp sensor, cold
start valve, or aux air valve.  Any of these could be causing your problem
and all the idle air and speed adjustment in the world will not cure it.
To adjust the AFM air screw, you really need an EGA.  The post today from
Chuck Meanley was an unbelievable low price for one of these pups...
usually they are a grand or more, even used and broke!  I own a DIY
version and it works &quot;OK&quot; but it is surely not the real thing :-(

Chuck, BTW, if no one has snarfed that pup, I am very interested!!! please
get with me and we will work out details!!!

&gt; Thanks for the post on wheel bearings.  What price did
&gt; you pay for yours, and where did you get them?  I
&gt; noticed that Bus Depot has them also.

It was ~5 years ago, and I think they were a bit cheaper than Ron has
posted, but that was some years ago, add inflation and it's a wash... Ron
is usually at or below the going rate for such things.  The prices he has
looked good to me.  In northern VA if you are in a bind and can't wait
for mail order, Olympic on Eisehower Ave in Alexandria is very good as
well.

Please remember that my experience was with a '78 bus, not a V'gon.  Tho
the theory and bearings are the same as on a bay, the housing that the
V'gon wears on its rear end promises to make the job a true &lt;euphemism
mode=on&gt; bear &lt;euphemism mode=off&gt;

On the gas tank... baruch hashem, I have not had to deal with this yet...
my tank seems intact and I am not looking forward to it!
