I would really like to go to the Jerome show this year. Only problem is
time. I wouldn't have time to drive out and back by myself. Anyone want to
drive straight thru? If we drove straight thru ( about 1300 miles one way)
it would take about a week, including the show. Anyone want to go- I'll pay
for the gas.
Let me know- TBear





Don't take life too seriously, you'll never live through it.
