Hello, all.  I have been lurking here for a while, and have learned
much...thanks for all the info, you are a knowlegeable and helpful bunch.
Unfortunately, the time has come to sell my 73 Campmobile.  I live in
Burlington, VT.  Please p-mail me if you are interested and I will tell you
as much as I can.  

For the most part she is in pretty good shape.  A little rust here and
there, but it's not bad considering the weather up here in wet VT.  The
interior is original and complete with sink, fridge, table, fold down bed
and closets/cabinets

The engine has served me well, but needs someone to give more time and money
than I am able. 

A little love to this bus would go a long way.

Thanks...

Tabbatha
