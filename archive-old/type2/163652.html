Subject: '71 Brake Pressure Regulator - anyone have an extra? or
  solution?

Hello everyone, my brakes went out on BusZilla (rather sticking to the
floor) i made it home 25 miles - when i got underneath the pressure
regulator - i belive that regulates the pressure between the front and rear
brakes is covered in brake fluid - before i take it out - I was hoping
someone could give me a hint on either how to fix them, they are NLA, or if
someone has a good used one available.

Thanks in advance,
