Subject: Re: [T2] HELP: Where to check vacuum, how much is good?

Richard's comment applies to most busses, however your vacuum reading 
will also depend upon where you have your engine timed.  If you have a 
distributor with a vacuum retard (DVDA) , and you time it to the stock 
specification of 5 degrees ATDC you will get 11 to 12 inches.  I chased 
my tail for a couple of months trying to get 15 to 18 inches before I 
discovered this.

I was able to prove this by disconnecting my vacuum retard, re-timing 
to 7.5 degrees BTDC, adjusting the idle to 850 and voila; I had a solid 
17 inches vacuum.
