&gt; &gt; Craig &amp; The List,
&gt; &gt;    The subject of these ceramic heaters came up last year. Save your money, these things dont work. The amount of heat they put out is minimal. It won't defrost your windshield, and it sure as hell won't keep you warm! I got one mail order for $19.95, and I cancelled my AAA membership when I got their catalog offering me the same piece of crap for the &quot;member&quot; price of $35.00!! Jeff
&gt; 
&gt; I couldn't agree more.  All of those 12 volt heaters are rubbish.  They 
&gt; wouldn't keep an insulated mini warm let alone a bus.  

I'm making this a general post, as everyone seems to have misunderstood
me.  I wasn't suggesting you heat your entire bus with these things, just
the windshield.  I realize that it would never in a million years heat a
bus, but I was thinking that it might  defrost your windshield.  I used to 
have to get out and scrape mine every 1/2 mile or so, and I got really
tired of it.
