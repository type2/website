I've been doing some research on bio diesel during the past year, and in 
my opinion the Josh Tickel method (he wrote &quot;from the fryer to the fuel 
tank&quot;) is the way to go.  I don't believe spending $700 is required to 
make your car run on biodiesel.  In fact, i think it's much simpler than 
the kit makes it out to be.  I'm sure some of that stuff is very 
necessary, but i'm also sure you can get away with not having most of it. 
Now if only I could find a diesel bus for a dollar....
just my $0.02.....
