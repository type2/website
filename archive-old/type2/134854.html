Subject: Re: [T2] John vs Mario

kick me of the list then. When a known crook is trying to come across to the
list as one of the good guys, I'm going to say something, especially when
nobody else is.

I only say something when he scouts for new victims. Because you have heard
it before means nothing to someone that is new to the list and knows nothing
of Marios antics and history.
