In regards to your note below, the best place I've found for good, really 
cheap, nice and alternative campgrounds are in the AAA Camper Guides.  Become 
a AAA member, and you can get these guides for free for all over the USA.  
Typically, I can find campgrounds for between $5 and $12 in many areas.  They 
are usually in rural settings, and tend to have pit toilets, sometimes 
showers, sometimes not, but are the most beautful and rustic places to go 
camping that one can find.  They are typically State Parks, which is why I 
think their prices are lower and their facilities less saphisticated.

Also out west, in really outback rural areas, you can typically find 
campgrounds that are for FREE, believe it or not, in the same guide.

 Hello everyone,
 
 My family and I will be driving from Toronto, Ontario, down the eatern
 seaboard, across the north coast of the Gulf of Mexico, down through Texas 
and finally into Mexico.
 
I've been looking at &quot; RV Park and family campgrounds of America &quot; on
 the internet and find that it will cost around $25 - $30 per night for our 
VW bus and
 tent.   These campgrounds range from 40 - 800 RV sites in size, and they all
 have cable hook-ups, game rooms, hot tubs, swimming pools, big screen tv's 
etc.
 
 My question is; are there alternative campgrounds that are perhaps
 smaller, unusual, and cheaper through the US ? Where do bus folk go when 
traveling ? How does one find these places ?
 
 Thanks for any help.
