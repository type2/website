&gt; &lt;&lt; I know it's a little different from what your problem is, but I solved one 
&gt; of the the cold breezes in mine by simply pulling the curtains to. Makes it 
&gt; a little hard to see sometimes, but it made a pretty big difference this 
&gt; past weekend.
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Right above the seats is a roof bracket...A clear (get the heavy stuff
&gt; from an upholstery shop) plastic curtain can be hung from it to drop
&gt; behind the seats and partition the front of the cab from the rest of 
&gt; the interior.

a little more expensive is the strips like they use in big
walk in refrigerators.  I have priced a roll at a plastics wholesaler
nearby and it is a heck of a price break on a whole roll of it
   but a roll would probably do 4-5 VW's vans so if anyone is interested
in going in with me to buy it, send me a p-mail
