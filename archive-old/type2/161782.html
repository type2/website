Subject: RE-INTRO Been Away for a Year Now - but I am back again

AN AFTER THOUGHT &gt;&gt;&gt; FIRST .. I tend to be a bit LONG WINDED .. so you might 
want to skim through this and go right to the bottom for my question .. 
Thanks . . &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

It has been a really bad year for me ..  more than that actually.  About 2 
years ago, one of my closest friend passed away from cancer .. Last January 
my 4 year old grandson got cancer and passed away in August .. Last month I 
got a phone call that my i2nd best friend since high school has ... CANCER 
~~  Went to Miami 2 weekends ago to visit her .. I don't think I will get to 
see her again if I don't get back this weekend or next at the latest.  I 
decided to try and make it down there rather than the funeral .. I have had 
enough funerals already ....

Anyway .. I am Diane, 67 bus .. always a project but a daily driver that 
pretty much never lets me down.  I do 60 miles a day round trip back and 
forth to work.  Everything I do with the bus since day 1 turns into a 
disaster .. Her and I are like twins ..

Most recently I had her painted ..  Until then she was painted purple with 
flowers and peace signs and the like .. I know that not many bus owners are 
old hippies ... but I am and I am the one who did the purple tye dye with 
the flowers.  I used to keep a bucket of paint pens, like the kind you use 
on model airplanes in the back and when I would visit the grandkids they 
would say, &quot;can we color on the bus ??&quot;  and I would tell them &quot;sure, you 
know where the paint is .. &quot;  It was really hard painting over all that .. 
especially with my grandson being gone now, but when he was sick he told me 
how he wanted the bus painted ..  and I promised I would paint it that way 
..  so I did.  GREEN &lt;&lt; his favorite color ... ORANGE &lt;&lt; my granddaughters 
favorite color and PINK &lt;&lt; mine and my daughters favorite color .. My bus is 
named Molly, after the movie &quot;Pretty in Pink.&quot;  Molly Ringwald starred in 
the movie and I would always say that I thought the bus would look PRETTY IN 
PINK .. and that is how she got her name, Molly Majik ..  I considered 
painting it yellow and naming it Banana Splitty ..  But wanted to fulfill my 
promise to my grandson and paint it his favorite color .. and I wanted a 
more 'normal' paint job .. GREEN, PINK and ORANGE .

So I ended up with the paint job from hell .. they really messed up and 
didn't put enough hardener in the paint and so they are going to sand it 
down this coming monday and re-do the entire job.  It has been a month .. 
said I needed to wait for the paint to cure ..  Not only was the paint soft, 
but they were sloppy .. runs, one color splashed on another ... didn't even 
take off the emblem to paint the front . . BUT THAT'S NOTHING compared to 
how the story ended .. they said &quot;we are going to have to re-paint your CAR 
.. but that has to wait a month .. it is ready come get it .. &quot;  What they 
forgot to tell me was that the first day it was there, someone broke the 
shifter ..  I got in the CAR to drive away after being dropped off and there 
was the shifter .. flopping around .. connected to NOTHING ..  Sure it is 
old .. but I fixed it once only a few years ago when it just came loose.  
Even if it just came loose again, I was there every day taking pictures of 
the paint progress .. you would think that someone would mention,  &quot;you 
better bring a tow truck when you come back for it.&quot;  They had been pushing 
it from bay to bay ..

http://www.jangle_dot_us  You can see her there .. See the old paint and the new 
. . The roof was supposed to be pink and the pink was supposed to be a 
different color but other than that and the paint can be removed with your 
fingernail .. and they painted the rubber .. and ... and ... It's a great 
job.

So I had the bus towed to be repaired.  Let the guy who did it a few years 
ago do it again.  Hte couldn't get it back together.  Towed it somewhere 
else . . They got something backwards and I could shift from 1st to reverse 
if I wasn't careful .. so I took it back and they put it back right.  A few 
days later it fell apart again.  TOWED IT BACK TO THEM .. they welded and 
welded .. the mechanic said the weld should hold longer than the bus ..

SO .. The MAIN REASON .. other than telling you my life story was to say 
that I wanted to maybe take it to Miami [from Orlando] in a few weeks and 
the shifting makes me nervous .. IT SHIFTS SO EASY from one gear to the next 
.. I am afraid it is falling apart.  I even took it back to the mechanic I 
was so sure the weld wasn't holding .. he looked . Told me to shift hard .. 
over and over .. he said .. beat it up .. if it is going to fall apart .. 
let it do it here, rather than on the road .. I did reverse .. speed shifted 
..  etc etc .. it didn't come loose .  The mechanic says that the gears are 
lined up perfectly and that is why it is shifting so smooth .. but I was 
hoping for an opinion ..  Could there be something he is missing .. the 
stick feels a little wobbley .. side to side feels like it should be tighter 
.. everything seems loose .. or was it that I drove it for years and there 
was something wrong ..
e
Thanks in advance for your opinions .. obviously I don't know how to do 
anything myself . . I know I should .. I have books .. the archives here .. 
etc etc .. I am just not at ease getting in the bus and driving it if I was 
the mechanic working on it ..

SORRY FOR THE EPIC NOVEL ... Diane in Orlando
