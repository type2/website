Subject: [T2] Complaint Excess Quoted Matl, Steve Havoc Sq Ports

I just tried 5 times to send to the T2 list about
Steve Havoc and his square ports.  Although my E-mail
arrived to Steve, the attempts to send the same
message to the T2 list was returned as having too much
quoted material.  There were no quotes anywhere in the
last few send attempts.  I searched for all 3 types of
quotes and none were found.  Grumble.  Complain. 
Grrrr.
    
The Steve Havoc picture shows Square ports.  The
square ports use a flat gasket of 2 different shapes. 
Be careful of which gasket is which.  Oval ports use a
substantial copper oval gasket without holes for the
exhaust head bolts, instead of a square port flat
gaskets, which DO have holes for the exhaust head
bolts.
  
Steve:  #1 and 4 use
&lt;http://www2.cip1_dot_com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VWC%2D029%2D256%2D251&gt;
flat exhaust gasket.
  
#2 and 3 use
&lt;http://www2.cip1_dot_com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VWC%2D029%2D256%2D252&gt;
flat exhaust gasket.
   
See the slight offset on the #2 and 3 gasket.
