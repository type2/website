Hello Sarah.

Just shooting in the dark: does your clutch cable guide have the
required 25 to 48 mm bend down?

&gt; than the next...
&gt; 
&gt; My clutch never behaved itself since I bought my bus. The cable
&gt; was on max, but it felt like it wasn't disengaging fully. So I put a
&gt; new cable in there, but still had to wind it up to max adjustment. It
&gt; was a big improvement, but I still had to floor the pedal for a smooth
&gt; shift.
&gt; 
&gt; Since I had the engine out last weekend I decided to put a new
&gt; clutch plate (friction plate) in there, see if that improved things.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, this evening after getting the brake lights to work (a frayed
&gt; wire up front), I tried moving the bus out of the garage. With the
&gt; engine was running, I could only shift into reverse, and then with
&gt; a horrible noise. I lifted my clutch-foot and rolled back. When I
&gt; pushed the pedal down it disengaged OK (i.e. I stopped moving).
&gt; Equally, if I put it in gear *before* starting the engine, everything
&gt; was OK, although it's not too happy about coming out of gear
&gt; with the engine running.
&gt; 
&gt; My guess: either
&gt; a) I've got the wrong cable
&gt; b) The pressure plate is worn (I don't fully understand the latter -
&gt; this is a hypothesis of my boyfriend's)
&gt; 
&gt; BUT  I am mystified and stupified at why everything is *worse* with the
&gt; new clutch plate than with the old (which, incidentally, wasn't worn
&gt; much).
&gt; 
&gt; AAAGGHHH. Help?
