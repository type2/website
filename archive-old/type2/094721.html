Subject: Re: [T2] Timing


Jim,

You might get a lot of replies to this, but when you turn the engine to the
place where the points OPEN, then the light goes ON.

This is because with points closed, there is a complete circuit through the
12V (primary) part of the coil through the points, as you mentioned and in
that webpage.  This path is a much lower resistance than the static test
light, i.e. a short-er path. So the light does not come on with the points
closed.  The high current through the coil primary and the points is the
reason your coil will fry (overheat and melt wires) if the points are closed
and key on without the engine running.

Then when the points open, the primary current has nowhere else to go but
through the test light. So it goes ON.

You are right about everything else, but to clarify, the spark happens
because, after the points are closed for a bit (enough dwell), magnetic
field caused by current through the primary coil winding is also induced in
the secondary coil.
The magnetic field is like electrical momentum.  When the points open,
breaking the field and momentum, that 12V difference in the points gap is
transformed to something like 60,000 Volts across the secondary and spark
plug gap.  That field energy wants to go somewhere!

Anybody know a possible source?

&gt;Wrong!!!!  The light goes off.  The spark is induced in the high tension
&gt;side of the coil by the collapse of the magnetic field created by the
&gt;12v current flowing into it when the points are closed. OPen the points,
&gt;the field collapses and the ignition spark happens. Read all about it here.
