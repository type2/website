Subject: [T2]  Warning stay away from Fox Trail Family Campground, Fancy Gap, VA

Over Christmas I decided to take a couple weeks to tool around the Blue Ridge
Mountains and the parkway.  Well the parkway was snowed over so just camped
whenever and wherever I could on back roads.  Well I brought the AAA camp
guide and one night it was getting dark so I decided to go to FOX TRAIL FAMILY
CAMPGROUND.  It is in Fancy Gap, VA.  Well it is about 5:30 PM and the gate is
half open when I pull up.  So I drive in and go to the office. Other people
are camping. Well the office is dark and no sign about late check ins like
most camp grounds so I turn around and start to head back out.  As I am
pulling away the host comes down from the house and asks what I am doing, I
tell him I was just looking for a place to camp, saw the office was closed and
was just leaving.  Well he pulls a gun and aims it at the under side of my bus
and says I thought you were leaving. And I did.

I reported this event to AAA, they are sending a copy of my report to the
field inspector  for review during the property's upcoming evaluation.  They
go on to say should this be a recurring pattern it would be grounds for
withdrawal of the AAA endorsement.  So from what I get from the letter, they
are doing nothing, so.....

OBC If you are driving a bus I would think twice about camping at this camp
ground.
