David, Bob,

The gasket for the stock dual carb engines is a single sheet of stamped
aluminum. 

The gasket for stock FI is a sandwich affair with a hard plastic core
and some sort of fibrous (impregnated paper/carboard?) facing.

The gasket for an aftermarket conversion can be *anything*!  

Melissa seemed to be describing gaskets that more closely resembled the FI
gaskets than the dual carb gaskets, so I talked of the FI gaskets, not the
dual carb gaskets.  Either gasket is available from any reliable parts
source.  Which of these gaskets will work with/is correct for &quot;Joe
Goefast's patent carb conversion&quot;? That I cannot answer.

In retrospect, since the gaskets I have seen for FI all have a *hard*
plastic core and what looks to me like an impregnated paper/cardboard
facing, what Melissa describes, 

    &quot;2 metal gaskets on each intake.  these were mucked with a 
    black rubber like gasket material between them&quot;

could very well be two of the dual-carb aluminum sheet gaskets glued
together and with the gap filled with some sort of RTV. This may be
because the original installer of her &quot;conversion&quot; did not have the proper
gasket or did not recognize the difference between the dual carb and FI
gaskets.  It may also be that the manifold was so uneven that this was all
that would achieve an adequate seal between the manifold and the head.
