Subject: Re: [T2] tow bar opinons

Now that we have gotten the educational part out of the way.
 
I have used Jeremy tow bar for about 4 years using it to tow Bay window  
buses, Split window buses, also Golfs and Jettas. I have never not one time had  a 
problem of any sort. I have towed with it many many times and loaned it  out  
about 10 times. I haven't used Jamie Rivers stuff but, I have Jeremys  and 
it's great quality and he bends over backwards to make sure your happy. It  pays 
for itself the first time you use it.
