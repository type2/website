Subject: RE: Rust removal

Hello Scott.......I agree with your use of the heavier equipment at the 
present stage of your project. I was using your same equipment about two 
years ago on my Westy when I was dealing with the rust accumulations of 
about 25 years. Originally, I either cut out the area and replaced the 
metal, or ground the stuff away until I had smooth bare metal. Then I 
treated it with phosphoric acid and followed that with epoxy primer, or 
POR-15 in situations where I couldn't get to bare metal....like under the 
rear side windows where the two foot long screw-on panels go.

The stage my Westy is in right now calls for addressing small rust 
break-outs about the size of a house fly or smaller, where for some reason 
the original rust repair didn't hold after two years. The Dremel with an 
engraving burr gives me precise control over how wide and deep I go to 
prepare for the touch-up. I have about 5 such repairs on my list of things 
to do before taking the vehicle to a paint shop. The suggestions that Terry 
made when he replied to your post sound like even a better approach. I'm 
trying to get all the prep work done and then just contract for the final 
washing/degreasing, masking, sealing and shooting of the color coats...also 
one of Terry's suggestions.
