Subject: Key buzzer?

Today while troubleshooting the dome light switch on my drivers door, I
found an extra wire connected at one end to a contact on the dome light
switch and the other connected to a socket under the fuse panel. No
buzzer or relay in the socket. I'm famous for locking my keys in the bus
so I'm wondering if this is really a socket for a buzzer of some sort
and if so is the part still available? Part Number? Could I wire in a
Piezo buzzer or some other noise maker?
Thanks,
Tom
