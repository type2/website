Subject: Where to mount the fuel pump. Picture please?

Hello List,

Well I have searched the archives and have not found a
decent pic of an electric F.I. Fuel Pump mounted on a
bus. I have a 1974 bus and I am installing a  914 2L
engine with with a 79 Federal bus F.I. Can someone
take a picture of their electric fuel pump on their
bus so I know where to mount it? I am tempted to mount
it using plastic wire ties and pieces of old door seal
to damper vibrations but I have the origional ruber
mounts on their way in the mail. I just need to know
where is the best place to mount it. Thanks and have a
great day!                                            
                                                      
      Regards,

David Kelly
