Subject: San Diego listees?

All,
     just found out that my family and I will be transferring to San Diego in Aug/Sep.  Have never been there before and was wondering about the area / VW shops/junkyards etc. and a good area to look for a house to rent for a kind hippie family with kids/dogs/and a couple of busses.

please e-mail me off list ;)
