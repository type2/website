&gt; are the extractors much better? give better performance, more
&gt; power, better fuel economy? or is that just a salesman pitch?


A true &quot;header&quot; system can slightly improve performance and fuel economy.
But the extractor systems typcally sold are not true header systems.  The
additional performance and economy that they will provide (partcularly on a
stock engine) is negligable, and, in my opinion, more than offset by the
fact that they are typically louder and rust out _much_ sooner than a good
European stock exhaust system.  One possible exception is the '75-79 bus
system, which originally used a convoluted system of elbows and pipes and
may benefit somewhat from the simpler path of an extractor system.
