Subject: Re: [T2] Oil cooler lines

With an air conditioner v-belt pulley behind the engine fan on a type 4
it would be easy enough to just use a VW Vanagon  (83.5 to 91) power
steering pump to circulate the oil through a cooler on an air cooled
engine, probably just a task of eliminating the actuator valve action on
the pump so it would run constant.
This could be an avenue I take as a last resort.

Stan Wilder

&gt; &quot;The best oil cooling setup would simply take oil from the sump, run 
&gt; it
&gt; through a cooler, and return it to the sump.  This would entail 
&gt; another
&gt; oil pump or perhaps a dual pump as installed in the autostick bug.
