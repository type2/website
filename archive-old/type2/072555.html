Hello, 
As most of you know, my brother (who attended Everybus) was in the hospital with a very serious illness.  He was admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care in Chapel Hill on Tuesday April 24th.  He struggled with this virus for 9 days, and I am completely heartbroken to tell you all that he passed away on May 3rd _at_  7:15pm.  He fought with total bravery, but it was not meant to be.  I would like to send a special thank you to all of the kind people who made an effort to welcome him to Everybus, since that was the last couple of days that he was aware of what was going on. (Rob, Jon, Snoopy, Dave &amp; Sherry)  He had a blast!!!  Jonathan was a very sweet, kind, and extremely talented 17 year old.  If you would like to know more about this, please pmail me.

I am not posting the details of his illness or death on here, b/c in no way am I turning this into a spectacle for those who were not close to him.
Thanks,
