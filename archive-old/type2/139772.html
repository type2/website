&gt; 2.  Now here's the weird one - when I make a left turn and step on the

&gt; Never happens when I make a right turn.  And it's intermitant as well.
&gt; Sometimes the left turn signal works just fine.

been there done that, somewhere along the run there is a place where a
bare wire from the left turn signal and the brake lights are touching, it
is intermittent because of normal vehicle vibration.  I would suspect
somewhere near or in the left rear turn signal housing but that is a guess
these kinds of intermittent electrical problems can be really hard to
find.   good luck

&gt; Hopefully, all these problems are connected and will require only one
&gt; fix.  Knowing my luck, however, these are three different problems....

doubt it,  although if the brake light is shorting out it could be causing
the engine to stall because of the electrical drain on a weak ignition
system.  does the engine stall if you do not have your foot on the brake??

it restarts usually because you have to put it in park and you don't have
your foot on the brake... just a thought,  give it a try in some big empty
parking lot or something, drive along and put you foot on brake, if it
starts to stall let off the brake and see if it runs normally....??

just a shot in the dark but sounds like you have checked just about
everything else.

the hard starting is very unlikely to be linked

good luck
Bob
