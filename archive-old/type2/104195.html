Subject: half shaft bolt and washer question

I was reading that I should not use my old lock washers that they will 
come loose - is this true??
They actually look like waffle washers, not split lock washers.
Also each CV had two plates with holes for two bolts this sits on top 
of the plate of the boot. Do these just need to go opposite each other 
or are they positioned on particular holes? TIA
New transmission is here!!
exhaust is coming off this weekend and off to powder and ceramic 
coating!!
new motor mounts
and clamps on every hose - no vacuum leaks!!!!!!!!
