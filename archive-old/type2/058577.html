Subject: What causes backfiring???

Hey all,
In reply to the &quot;how fast&quot; post I was thinking about my last trip, and
remembering traveling downhill on Monteagle TN. It was the only time the
entire trip that my bus backfired, a few times. 

I don't really know what causes backfiring, my old engine would really
backfire badly when traveling down hill in the Great Smokeys, this new
engine just had a couple. If someone could fill me in on what causes
this and if it is an indication of something needing attention (like
timing???) I would be most appreaciative.
Thanks,
scoob
