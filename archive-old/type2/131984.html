Subject: Killed my T2 vanagon...

Last week my van ran like a top.  Now it doesn9t start.  All I did was seal
the engine compartment with the genuine VW seal, and I degreased the engine
itself.  Herin lie the problem methinks.  I used a spray-on degreaser.  I
tried to keep it away from delicate parts.  Now it doesn9t turn over, though
the engine is sparkling clean.  I liked it better dirty and running!  Smells
rich now.  Did I short something out (starter rolls and engages)? The fumes
from the degreaser may be screwing with fresh air intake? (It stinks).
