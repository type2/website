Subject: A TIREsome thread

Thanks to all who responded to my tire question.  I am going to go with the 
Yokohama Y356 D load range.  Feedback on them has been good and I like the 
higher load range for when my Westy is fully loaded.  The price seems good 
too.  The only drawback seems to be that they are not all season. This 
really won`t be an issue for me since I don`t ever plan to drive my bus in 
the winter.  As much as the look and versatility of all terrain tires appeal 
to me, they don`t match my driving habits and requirements as well as the 
Yoko.  I`ll report back on how they work out for me once I get them on.  
Unfortunately the crummy weather in the northeast means my bus will stay in 
winter storage a little longer. I am counting the days.  Thanks again for 
your help everybody,

James.
