Subject: Really loud bus- need advise before proceeding!

Hey Everyone,
So I was helping a friend fix his 1978 bus and get it up and running.  I 
believe he had pulled the engine and put new lifters in and I think he 
also pulled the heads.  He said that upon reinstallation he torqued the 
heads properly and stuck everything back together.  We installed the 
Megasquirt because he fried his wiring harness due to an electrical fire 
(battery moved and hit charcoal canister and sparked into the harness).

When we went to start it, the bus was REALLY loud.  So I asked him if he 
put the exhaust gaskets in, and he said no.  So we pulled the exhaust 
off, installed the copper gaskets, fired it up, and it was still just as 
horribly loud again.  There are no apparent exhaust leaks as all the 
seals look really good.  I *think* it has good compression, but my next 
idea is to check compression on each cylinder to see if maybe one of the 
heads isn't installed correctly?

Does anyone have any suggestions on what we should check next before we 
pull the engine out.  Like anything obvious.  Btw, it is a 1978 westy.

Thanks!
Mike
