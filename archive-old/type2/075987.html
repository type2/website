Subject: Re: [T2] solid/hydraulic swap?

Some people have better &quot;LUCK&quot; with junk engines than others. Mechanical
things are all about luck, there is always something that will break, the
question of when and how is alwasy tough to think about.

Before I started this as a profession I played for years, I can honestly say
that I have built good engine from junk, old parts. For years I never had
cam problems, mismatched lifters and etc were just fine, then all of a
sudden it all changed. for 13 months straight we were absolutely plagued
with cam failures, from every suplier except web cam.

Old cams, with old lifters sometimes will work, I'm not a gambling man,
especially on customers engines, being shipped all over the world.

Try the swap, drive for 100 miles and remove the oil filter, cut it open and
see what you find.if it is magnetic particles, then hold on you are in for a
ride!

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; No doubt.  But then if it runs long enough to brag about, it's not a
&quot;junk
&gt; &gt; engine&quot;, is it?  And congratulations to those who can take a perfectly
&gt; &gt; matched and professionally rebuilt pay-through-the-nose engine and trash
it
&gt; &gt; in 30k miles.  They should get an award for their ignorance.

&gt;
&gt; Well said.
&gt; As an additional FYI:
&gt; Only the pushrods/lifters were choice used. I only mentioned those since
that
&gt; was the topic.
&gt; The bus itself had at least 192,000 miles on it. The reason I say 'at
least' is
&gt; because that is what the odometer showed when I bought the Westy. However,
the
&gt; bus lost 1/10th of a mile for each mile I drove it because of a cracked
gear in
&gt; the speedo. I did not know how long it was that way before I bought it.
&gt; It used a quart of oil every 100 miles. So I pulled the engine and
disassembled
&gt; it. I found no damage to the bottom end. The main and rod journals were
still
&gt; standard, the cam lobes were still like new. I only needed all new
bearings. The
&gt; pistons and cylinders were junk, so I replaced them. I questioned the list
about
&gt; NPR P &amp; C's.... just about everyone pooh-poohed those. Well, I am VERY
happy
&gt; with them also. The heads were fine. No guide wear. All I had to do was
remove
&gt; carbon. The valve seats and valve faces were fine. After lapping them with
fine
&gt; compound, nothing else was needed.
