Subject: Help finding parts

Just joined the list...

I moved from Vancouver, BC to Austin, TX a few years ago and I drove my '78
Camper the whole way.  When I arrived I found I couldn't register my vehicle
because the Canadian model wasn't up to US spec (duh) in 1978.  Since then
it's largely sat in my driveway and with only 58,000km on the clock it's
breaking my heart so I've decided to get it &quot;roadworthy&quot;.

Anyway after dealing with VW America and US customs I finally determined
that I need the following done before I can register my bus:

- brake failure warning lamp too small (I guess the red dot with the B on
the dash)

Sounds ridiculous but I've got the letter to prove it.  Anyone know what I
can do about this one.  What's the one like on the US '78?  Was it simply
susposed to spell BRAKE?
 
- speedo in miles not kilometers

Where are good places to get one of these?  Has any had an experience
swapping out a speedo?  I mean, what do you do about the odometer reading
legally?

I would like to get a new canvas for the pop-tent and I'm also looking for a
new gas tank because there is too much rust in the old one and clogs the
fuel line occasionally.  This happened because my father (previous owner),
let it still with half a tank of gas (no stabilizer) from 1982-1989.
