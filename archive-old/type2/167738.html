&gt;&gt; Speaking of VW places being auctioned: Does anyone know anything about the
&gt;&gt; VW place just outside of Morgantown, WV on Route 119 (just before you hit
&gt;&gt; Point Marion, PA)?
&gt;
&gt; also wasn't there a place near Uniontown PA on the old route to
&gt; Pittsburgh??  I bought some cables from the guy, said he had several
&gt; construction trailers full of cables for VW....??

This place is about ~15-20 miles south of Uniontown right on 119, but I 
have heard of another place on route 51 (in Elizabeth, maybe?) right on 
the route from Uniontown to Pittsburgh.  Never been there though, and the 
person I talked to hadn't been there in ... 4-5 years, so I don't know the 
status of it.

(I've google'd for the place on route 51, but not been able to find any 
info on it...)
