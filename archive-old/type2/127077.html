&gt; 68 doors are one-year-only. The lock knob is on top of the sill like 75? and up. But the doors do not have

&gt; 68 door handles are push button like 64-67 but the paddles are a different length. Lever action handles

69 deluxes had door vents. and I think the old 68 deluxe i scrapped had
them too.
