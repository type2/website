Message-ID: &lt;373B5260.B2540DDA_at_swbell_dot_net&gt;

Ran into a couple with a '71 Westy at a local convenience store tonight.
the lady that owns the bus looked at me and asked if I had the upper
bunk in my'69 Westy, I replied; &quot;no.&quot; to which she replied: &quot;I'm not
gonna use mine, make me an offer.&quot;  This cot has no canvas, but does
have all the hardware.  I've got no idea how much something like this
should go for and have no idea even what to offer her.  What are these
things going for  at   recycle yards or at flea markets, swap meets?
etc.   I can make the canvas (I have canvas leftover from making the
poptop tent and access to a sewing machine and heavy guage needles and
thread)

Thanks for the info,

Steve
'69 Westy
(hand built by me and my wife - every nut, bolt, and rivet)
