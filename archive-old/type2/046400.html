Subject: [T2] Parts disappearing?

I went to a VW show and swap meet this weekend and have been to several in
the last 6 months or so. I am finding very few Split Window buses in the
shows, or attending, and even fewer body parts in the swap areas. I was
talking to some of the swappers and they were saying that there are just
hardly any stuff out there anymore.

Maybe we can have a survey here: Are Split Window buses and parts getting
that rare? Does anybody know a single large source for Split Window stuff?
