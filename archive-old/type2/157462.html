Subject: Re: [T2] Horn decided to start honking at the police today. :-)

A lot of possibilities, but I have seen several in the
wrecking yards that were breaking apart in the
mechanism for the turn signal arm / high/low beam. As
I recall, there is also the possibility that the left
side forward screw is loose. What I am referring to is
what you see after you remove the steering wheel.
There were thin copper slivers one time - IIRC they
were peeling off the underside of the steering wheel -
but I would have to disassemble again to trigger the
memory! Coulda been a different vehicle... Anyway,
once you get the steering wheel off (Loosen the nut a
bit, then rock the wheel hard until it pops loose) it
will then become quite clear. I think I've been
running without that forward screw for the last 10
years or so to &quot;solve&quot; the problem. Lemme know what
you find. -BaH

&gt; So I'm driving down the hill near by house with an
&gt; RCMP officer behind me, when all of a sudden my horn
&gt; starts intermittently honking all by itself. It had
&gt; previously not been honking half the time when I
&gt; pushed on the horn button, so I was surprised when
&gt; it decided to alert the police by honking. I pulled
&gt; over, as did the mountie and he laughed when I told
&gt; him the story.
