Subject: RE: [T2] 78 westy...auto tranny...stumped!

I'll second Bob's comments.  You'll need to yank the trans (not an easy job
I'm sorry to say) and replace the seal after flushing her out.  I imagine
you got water in the valve body and who knows what happened when it finally
vaporized.  Vapor lock?  Also, I imagine your clutches/bands should be
inspected as water is not a good lubricator.

Finally, there is an internal seal between the gear box and the final drive.
It's easy to blow that seal too if internal pressures go too high.

While it's out you might as well rebuild it if you are not funding
constrained.

Ask me how I know all this.  I drive a 1978 auto, too.  (It's normally a
real workhorse but you can't abuse it as you would a manual tranny that can
be punished until it explodes!)

&gt; can help I have a automatic 78 westy with a weber progressive

&gt; accidentally got water in the transmission fluid (aaahhh!!!) I've had

how did you get water in the tranny fluid????

&gt; the fluid changed out twice now and I'm still having major problems,

&gt; Reverse....help! When I put the bus in reverse it makes a &quot;clunk&quot; sound
&gt; and if I put my foot on the gas it will go backwards, but feels as

&gt; itself...it does the same thing in &quot;D1&quot;. Like I said, it works in drive,

whenever you do something to the auto tranny you need to put handbrake on
start engine in neutral.
shift slowly  N, D, 2, 1, 2, D, N, R, P, R, N.  shut engine down.

then check fluid and correct if problem.

&gt; smelled tranny fluid and when I parked her, tranny fluid was coming out
&gt; in a stream from what appeared to be where the torque converter
&gt; is...tranny
&gt;  fluid was basically sprayed everywhere and dripping from a lot of

sounds like you blew a torque converter seal.. gotta drop engine to change
under $20 for the seal.

&gt; places...not good Could this all be caused by water in the fluid??? Is
&gt; there any way to fix this or am I looking at swapping out my
&gt; transmission? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks!

if you staarted the engine with water in the tranny it has gotten into the
Torque converter and it is pretty dern hard to clean, you have to take
engine out to put in new tranny seal, so folloow the drain instructions in
Bentley and refill.

you may have damaged the tranny but no real way to know until you get it
cleaned out real good and try it.   sounds like maybe your reverse/1st
gear plates may be burned.  this is a major rebuild or new tranny

good luck
