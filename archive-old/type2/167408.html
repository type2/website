&gt;The Information Highway has a lot of neat stuff going

I did a lot of tire research about a year ago to take a survey of what was available at the time. I dropped into local stores, called manufaturers, called dealers in other cities/states. What I experienced was:

Most dealers can't locate tires in their computer systems for basic reasions (can't locate by vehicle, can't locate by metric size, etc)

I'm forced to search the websites of the manufacturers (often those based in other countries) to locate the product code for a particular tire and give it to them. Most times, with my printout (be sure to take one with photo and product #) they are able to locate it in the computer. 

After proving the tire is made, they often can't order them from their distributors requiring you to mail order them and pay them $15/tire for mount and balance. When they can find them, you often have to pay for the shipping on top of their price anyway.

The old guys in the tire shops may know what a bus needs, but any kid who depends on the tire company database will be clueless. Sometimes the old guys think they know but select the wrong tire anyway and there's no convincing them which is even worse. It's like the VW shop that's been around for 30 years and the owner still doesn't know that 91RON isn't the same as 91 at the gas pump.

The 185R14 tire just isn't a popular enough size to be able to find it on the shelf. I wish it were otherwise but buying and mounting them costs a premium these days.

Thank goodness for Bus Depot.
