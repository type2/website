Subject: Re: End of the road

&gt; &gt; Well, it would seem I've hit the end of the road with Kevin... The 
&gt; Devcon
&gt; &gt; didn't work (tried to seal a crack in the block), and the engine is 
&gt; now
&gt; &gt; kaput.. (technically speaking)
================================&gt;
I just gave away my Buick Park Avenue Ultra to my Dad.
Just did not feel good in it any more.
All I use now for personal driving is one of two 1970 VW Campers.

What I'm getting at is................ Fix it again !
Forget the Devcon type fix, and use proper components all way around.
You'll feel good in your bus when you've fixed it with proper components.
All other fixes and all other wheels just will not give you that 
righteous glide down the road.
