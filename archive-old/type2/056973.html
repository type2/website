Hello all,

Well, things turned out for the good after all. After a week of haggling
and phone calls, the 76 is finally here and parts ready to be transplanted.
When I'm done transfering the items from one to the other, I'll be selling
the 76. So if you would be interested, let me know. The bus will still be
running and driveable when I'm done.

Off to a camping trip before the transplants begin!!!!
