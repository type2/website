Subject: Procedure for putting OEM stripping on 1975 Campmobile?

At the Bug Out last weekend I purchased an original stripping kit for a
breadloaf.  After reviewing the contents all pieces seem to be there and
only one piece looks as though ther is a gap beteen the sicker and the
paper. It is very small.   Has anyone ever applied a VW stripping kit to
their bus.  This kit was for a 68-71 but appears to be able to fit my 75,
doesn't conflict with the turn signals up front.  It is white and I feel that
the combination with my White tire cover and beautiful blue/green interior
and yellow exterior will screem &quot;cool funky 70's bus&quot;  or maybe &quot;nice
stripes Dumb ___!&quot;  Let me know what you all think
