Tire salespeople are just that. They will sell you whatever they have  
on sale
and can make the biggest commision on. You bus REQUIRES a MINIMUM
load rating of 1540 lbs per tire. You CANNOT get this on a P rated  
passenger tire.
You need either a reinforced sidewall tire or a commercial tire. The  
CORRECT size tire
for your bus is 185R14 w/reinforced sidewalls or 185R14C. The C means  
commercial.
Notice there is NO middle aspect number. That is correct. Most  
salesman think you are
stupid and you left the 75 out. Wrong! Most salesman will tell you  
there is no such size as
185R14. Wrong!
