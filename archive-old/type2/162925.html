&gt;     Actually the Tig is the way to go for body work. Not fast but much more
&gt;control, and far less distortion. But the fact is you need all three plus a
&gt;stick welder and Plasma Cutter to do complete auto work. Save up the bucks
and get the best machines you can afford the first time.

	This could be a good moment to mention again the amazing 
Henrob oxy-acetylene torch.  In my original plug I forgot to mention 
it's also v good on thin tin.
