Subject: [T2] Fuel Hoses for 2.0 FI '78 Westy

Hello everyone!

I've been consulting the www.type2_dot_com site lately while working on my poptop.  I've gotten the message about replacing the fuel hoses for my fuel injection.

I'm not an experienced mechanic, but I got under the bus today to trace the fuel line and see what it would take to do the job.  It looks like I have a metal line from the gas tank that attaches to a 7mm hose to the fuel filter, then 12mm (?) hose from the opposite side of the filter back to metal line.  The metal line continues into the engine compartment, then to a junction near the manifold.  The outlet of the junction also appears to be a metal line.  Does this sound correct?

If this is correct, it looks like I only need about 4 inches of 7mm hose and maybe 8 inches of the larger hose.  I can't imagine that almost all of it is metal, but could this be correct on the '78 Westies???

Thanks mucho for any help!!

P.S.  I just finished working on my poptop and luggage rack.  A friend backed my van out of my garage WAY too fast (before the new shocks, unfortunately) and the lip at the garage floor caused the van to lift and collide with the top of the garage door.  Garage door:1, luggage rack:0.  Result was that huge sections of fiberglass were torn completely off of the luggage rack and also around the seal area of the top of the poptop.  I used a fiberglass product called SolarEz to recreate the missing fiberglass sections, then sanded and painted the luggage rack and poptop.  New seals followed.  Quite a job, but the top looks beautiful!  If anyone has any question about the SolarEz, I swear by it.  VERY easy to use and does a great job!  (And no, I don't own stock in the company or get a commission.....)
