&gt; I don't know if you can use them. Anyone?

i would say no, you need to use solid lifter pushrods with solid lifters.

solid pushrods are longer than hydraulic ones. the size difference comes
about because the effective length of a solid lifter is shorter than that of
a hydro lifter. i don't have the size handy, but i believe it is about 15mm
difference. if you changed lifters and cam to solid and kept the hydro
pushrods, you would have the adjusting screws very far into the rocker arms
in order to open the valves. the valve geometry would be adversely affected
by this. the motor would work, but the valve geometry would not be ideal.

good used solid lifter pushrods are relatively easy to find.
