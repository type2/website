Subject: removing distributor question

Im taking some pieces off my parts bus to put on my westy.

The heater boxes are already off.. i hate it when you have to loosen
a screw which was put on when the motor was out. Heads are up rather
than down and I can't get at them.. ah well

Anyway the question is this : when removing the distributor (complete)
out of my old 2 liter fi do i have to move the motor to the timing mark.. 
cylinder
1 or whatever? Or can i simply loosen that one 13mm bolt facing straight
up to the ceiling and the distrib should pull out? right?

I wish the books would have a picture of the bolt im needing to loosen.
I was thinking maybe the timing mark was simply referred to so you could
stick the distributor back on easy.

please and thanks :)

James
