Michael, etal.,

This is because the search engine has been moved.  The search engine that
the busted bus page (a relic page, BTW) points to does not work.  It never
did.  Which is why Steve Gutknecht wrote a new and really spiffie search
engine for us that allows all sorts of complex searches.  If you have
bookmarks from the old type2 page, delete them and go visit the page anew!
Ken and Steve Gutknecht have invested a lot of effort in overhauling the
page and it deserves a re-visit. 

The type2 page is at:  http://www.type2_dot_com/

The search engine is at: http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/
