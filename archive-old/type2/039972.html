First of all, I'd like to say thanks to everyone on the list who responded
with a ton of helpfull suggestions.

Second, I'm happy to report that the broken off stud has been removed, the
exhaust is back on, the bus is back up and running just as well as before!
Success!!!

And finally, to tell you what finally worked.   I was finally able to remove
the stud (thanks to a hepfull hint from an older gentleman that use to be a
race-car mechanic) by putting on a nut and tightening it up the stud.  Then,
take a cheap socket just slightly smaller than the stud, heat the stud up
with a torch, then hammer the socket onto the stud.  Re-heat and pound it
again.  Then, slowly turn the stud out.  One of the studs came out with just
the socket.  The socket broke off on the second one, but had burred up the
threads so badly that when I attempted to take the nut off it could no
longer pass over the burred threads and took the stud out.    Breathe a
heavy sigh of relief.

Seriously, thanks to everyone.  I love this list.

&gt; &gt;Hello,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks in advance for your much-needed assistance.  I have a 1974 VW
Westy
&gt; &gt;with a 2.0L, Carb, Pancake Engine.  If you went to Everybus, its the
orange
&gt; &gt;one with the University of Florida Tags and Gator Sticker.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Decided to clean the heat exchangers.
&gt; &gt;Drove Bus onto ramps to get room underneath.
&gt; &gt;Taking off heat exchanger and 2 nuts came off with 1/2 the bolt leaving
&gt; &gt;other 1/2 in heads
&gt; &gt;  Tried WD-40, Liquid Wrench, Propane Torch, Vice Grips, etc... no luck.
&gt; &gt;Cleaned and painted heat exchangers (used Rust-O-Leum High Heat Paint)
&gt; &gt;Put it all back together (minus 1/2 of two bolts).
&gt; &gt;Drove off ramps and cranked bus.
&gt; &gt;  LOUD!  LOUD!  LOUD!  Oh yeah, and it backfired a lot.  Especially after
&gt; &gt;hold throttle, let off, backfire.
&gt; &gt;  Puffing exhaust out from the cylinder where the bolts sheered off.
Also,
&gt; &gt;seems to be cooking my paint.
&gt; &gt;Feeling pretty bad and typing letter to Type2 friends for help.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;QUESTIONS!
&gt; &gt;1)  How do I get the bolts out?
&gt;
&gt; If there is enough of a nub sticking above the case, a stud removal tool
&gt; will do it. A set of them in Chinese Cheese costs $30. Real ones cost real
&gt; money. They are not designed for removing broken studs, just for removal
&gt; and replacement of whole studs without damage to the threads. They look
&gt; like a deep socket with a cam action mechanism inside.
&gt;
&gt; Try welding a nut to the nub, then turn it out with a socket.
&gt;
&gt; If no nub, it's 50/50 for me to get it out with an ez-out. It requires
&gt; drilling precisely down through the center, nothing like easy to do
without
&gt; pulling the head, and even then it takes a very serious attitude.
&gt;
&gt; Pull the head and take it to a machinist before you break off the ez-out.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;2)  Where do I get new ones (threaded on both sides, plain in the middle)
&gt;
&gt; Any good stocked hardware store, except in Montana where metrics are
&gt; forbidden by the militia.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;3)  Why is it backfiring?
&gt; Air getting sucked into the exhaust and mixing with unburned fuel.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;4)  What kind of paint should I have used?
&gt; &gt;5)  Is the Bus safe to drive like this?
&gt;
&gt; Valve damage is possable but not too likely. Answer=maybe yes, maybe no.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;6)  Is there any easier way to learn how to work on your own VW? (Can I
get
&gt; &gt;a tutor?)
&gt;
&gt; For $62 per hour plus expenses you could hire me. But I'm sure that's not
&gt; what you had in mind. Many Community Colleges have auto shop classes.
Could
&gt; be a good value for getting basic knowledge quickly. Don't expect to be
&gt; using T-II's as project examples, though.
&gt;
&gt; The list is the easiest way to go. It ain't no cakewalk.
