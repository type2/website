Subject: Re: [T2] Junk oil filters was Re: [T2] *Long distance drivers

When I am changing oil, I fill the new filter with fresh oil which takes
care of getting oil on the seal and the threads! The filter usually takes
about .5 quart which I deduct from the 3.7 quarts that goes into the
crankcase. This is how I was taught to do it many years ago and I have
always done it since. Supposed to be better for the engine when you start up
after the oil change. Any opinions?

Regards,

&gt; Sorry to pop your balloon, but the Bosch oil filters are designed to
&gt; compete with the crap market and are crap. Get the Mahle filters, or
&gt; genuine VW, which are made by Mahle. Everything else is risky. And if you
&gt; change your oil BEFORE is gets filthy, you can reuse the filter a second
&gt; time and your cost is no more than using the cheap junk.
&gt;
&gt; Look at the threads. If they have burrs and sharp edges they are junk
&gt; production. If they are smooth and nicely formed like the Mahle, Kneckt,
&gt; Mann or Hengst you have at least some empirical evidence of quality
&gt; production. Always smear some clean oil on the seal and a few drops on the
&gt; threads for installation and wipe the mount clean then turn them down
&gt; tightly by hand. Note that ALL European production comes off the showroom
&gt; with these quality brand filters only.
