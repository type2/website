Subject: Re: [T2] Twisted frame??

He should have been able to see your doors wouldn't close anymore.
Legally your only option is probably going to be to accept them paying
for professional repair, unless they offer you to total it, and you
agree with their offer. Otherwise, get three estimates from trusted
shops and don't accept anything less than the best repair. Even when
done right, a vehicle is never the same after frame damage.

 I had a flat today. It was a construction nail. Itook the flat to Big O
 Tire - where I have warranties - for service. This they did fine. But,
 now I've a problem. As they raised the 77 VW High Roof, the left set of
 floor hoist arms lifted and slipped. They caused my van to shift
 horizontally to the right and bounce before they right arms balanced the
 van. Now, the rear cargo door over the engine won't shut without
 pressing on the left bottom part of the door. And, the engine door is
 also twisted out of true. Both doors are now angled out of true. I'm
 concerned that my frame may be twisted. I'm going to a frame and body
 shop tomorrow for this. But, I wanted your thoughts. I got it documented
 as an incident at the shop, and they were very nice about it.
 
 The manager was in a bit of denial about the frame being damaged, but
 your thoughts are welcomed!
