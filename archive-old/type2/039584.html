Subject: Re: sway away kits/offroad

    I've logged tons of offroad miles over all kinds of stuff in both my old 
stock '71, and my current Sway-away equipped '77 Westy.  The '77 really is 
stiff as a board, but I haven't had any offroad problems as yet.  Ground 
clearance loss is negligible, plus when rocks hit them, they make an 
interesting thung! sound. (There is also an added bonus---when I put on my 
offroad tires, I only have to jack up the bus once per side.  It's so rigid, 
both wheels come off the ground!).  After two years with it, my impression of 
the kit is that it's great for better cornering, but has little effect in 
windy conditions.  Highly recommended for Westy owners, IMO.  

Matt Q.  (and what I REALLY want for offroad is one of those limited-slip 
thangs.  Whatever happened to the listee that was looking into some NOS units 
in Europe?)
