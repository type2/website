Subject: Re: [T2] HELP!! engine wireing questions!! trying to hook up
  replacement engine

Richard,
firt of all, I want to thank you for all your help. I
borrowed a friends haynes manual and it's useless!!!  ;-(
still looking for a replacement bently..but is there a
westfalia specific wiring diagram available anywhere?
maybe I should cc teh list?  ;-)...ok done...guys???


but..I have a few more questions  see below amongst prior
coments.

&gt; &gt; the wires do not completely match up....in particular
&gt; from
&gt; &gt; the alternator!(I am using the harness that had come
&gt; from
&gt; &gt; the bus, so it will match with the ECU, but there is
&gt; one
&gt; &gt; wire I can't figure where it connects, and can't find
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; lead that goes to teh temp? sensor by the distributor?
&gt; 
&gt; The oil pressure sender is behind the dizzy. The cylinder
&gt; temp sensor is by
&gt; the end bolt of the intake manifold where #3 cylinder is
&gt; located.
&gt; 
&gt; That wires goes up towards the heater booster fan, then
&gt; detours into the
&gt; wiring harness that goes through the firewall.
hmmmm! the oil pressure? but there are two wires coming
down from the heater fan??? which is it and what is teh
second one?




&gt; &gt; the alternator that came on the engine has a cable from
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; with two sub-cables...one tthe expected thick red
&gt; &gt; one....but the other one comfuses me....it has four
&gt; wires
&gt; &gt; brown, black, red, and green.
&gt; 
&gt; They go to the voltage regulator and meet where they plug
&gt; into the bottom of
&gt; it.
aha! I managed to determine which burned wires were what
colour, and found the voltage regulator in the cabinets.
I made a replacement harness and have installed, but forgot
to add the pig-tale wire to the blue wire in right
chassis-harness so will do today..


&gt; &gt; somehow I managed to LOSE my bently I got for it, and
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; vanagon one really doesn't help huh?  ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; Borrow one from the local library (except the cupertino
&gt; branch,
&gt; fists-a-waving!)
will see if the fremont one has one...not sure if they will
be of much use...last time they wouldn't let you check them
out...in closed stacks!  ;-(

I understand teh long wire from teh inj harness goes to the
#1 terminal on coil, and the green from dist goes on the 15
terminal, but there are other wires that appear from the
left side, than appear to go to coil, but not sure which
goes to what terminal, both black...one thick, one
thin.....and any others that go to coil?

There is a black wire from right side that appears to
probably go to teh black wire from teh alternator? this is
ffrom the westy harness, right?

than there is the whole vacuum-line fiasco...the '80 had a
sticker in the bay that showed what went where...but this
one...  ;-(

more questions later...
