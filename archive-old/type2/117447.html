&gt; &gt; New York City has just placed orders for 230+ Orion VII hybrid buses, these

&gt; &gt; NJ transit also has some MCI hybrids which are the big over the road coaches
&gt; &gt; (Greyhound type) that have a really large battery pack but operates similar
&gt; &gt; to the NYC buses.

&gt; Chattanooga has been using hybrids for a number of years. We even have our own
&gt; manufacturer:

they also are not 45 ft long, carry 100 passengers and go 65MPH
