Jan,

I have fixed up the sealing areas of an old splitty using my mig
welder.  There are a few of tricks in doing this.
1. clean the area of all traces of rust that you can down to bare metal,
it is possible that you may enlarge the holes a bit in the process.  A
wire brush on a drill motor worked good for me here.
2. practice on another piece of old bus tin with similar sized holes
3. use a low heat setting, too high and you'll blow a bigger hole

I started around the edges of the hole slowly building up the metal, one
little bit at a time and the hole would start to fill up with metal.
Don't stay too long as the surrounding metal may start to warp. (a wet
rag helps to keep the metal cool).  Before you know it the hole will be
filled.  I then used a 4&quot; electric grinder and slowly ground the metal
flush with the surrounding area.  Curves are tricky to get flat but
patience wins.

I repaired about 8 holes varying in size from 1mm to 7mm in a splitty
windshield using this method.

Good Luck,

Scott

&gt;The bad news is that (as is to be expected) there was some rust
&gt;under the seal. ... I want to take care of the rust. It's not too bad.
&gt;Just three spots (left, middle and right side) of the lower frame. I
&gt;think one needs welding, there's hardly any metal left.. The other two
&gt;can be preserved. Does anyone have any recommendations
