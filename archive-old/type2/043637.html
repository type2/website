Subject: Re: Overheating or not?

There is a gauge from VDO the sensor gets installed in the sump plate,and
the gauge gets installed under or in the dash. It's not hard to install.
Seems like more cooling is better with a bus.  I've installed a remote fan
along with a remote full flow filter.  It's not stock but Stella seems to
like it.
