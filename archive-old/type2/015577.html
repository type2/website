The easiest test is the tried and true. Pull a plug. Hook it up and ground
the electrode. Have someone crank the engine and watch for a blue/white
spark that goes SNAP. If it does, you may have a timing problem. Use a
timing light while cranking the motor. You can only very roughly static
time them. The reference is deceiving.

If, however, the spark at the gap is yellow and goes fuutt, it could be the
Pertronics or the coil or the condenser or the HT wire or the plug or the
cap or the rotor. A cracked rotor can leak some or all of your spark to
ground in the shaft no less so than a shorted coil or cracked cap.

The problem with the donar dizzy could be as simple as dirty points. A
finger print sometimes is all it takes. 

Verify spark intensity, then timing dynamically. If you can't turn the body
of the dizzy to the proper timing because the condenser hits something,
you'll have to rearrange the plug wires on the cap to try another 90°'s of
position. Or do the right thing and turn the drive gear to get the timing
of No. 1 to line up with the notch at TDC. Remember, the 009 is not stock,
and any of a dozen different condensers can be mounted. It's the same old
story. Go non-stock and get to finaggling to make it work.

That isn't Nikki Elko, is it?? Couldn't be. She's in California showing H.
Steve Dolan the sites.

&gt;Hello list,
&gt;
&gt;I got a call this evening from a young lady (Nicky) that's having some
&gt;problems with her 71 hardtop Westy. I wasn't sure of a a way to
&gt;test the dizzy with the Pertronix, so I put on my spare 009 (known good) and
&gt;static timed it first . It appears that the dizzy drive is off by a few
&gt;degrees, Also, is
&gt;there a way to test the Pertronix other than doing a parts swap? TIA
