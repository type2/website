&gt; Yep--back in the 60's when I deliverd pizza's in my 58 DelRay
&gt; couple--235 three on the tree--oil belching beater---this is all I used.
&gt; Re-refined oil.
&gt; 
&gt; I think it was $3.00 bucks a two gallon can--a bargain.
&gt; 
   We used Foxhead re-refined (1.99 for the two gallon
can at Two Guys from Harrison...) in my buddy's '58
Poncho (a &quot;gift&quot; from his uncle... ;-)
   We regularly changed the &quot;oil firing plugs&quot; from Pep
Boys (Manny, Moe, and Jack...remember the dirty trick
with the match book...?-)
