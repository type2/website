hi, my 72 westy (1700)  makes a loud knock/tapping sound when i start it
sometimes. it doesnt do it all the time but when it does do it it will not go
away unless i let the engine idle, then itll slowly go away completely. local
shop says maybe gudgeon pin sticking or rod bearings. if you put your hand on
the motor you can feel it. any ideas? im planning a cross country trip in
september and dont want to get stuck.
