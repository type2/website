&gt;When I read the archives on installing an Aux. battery I didn't see anything

&gt;Do I need one? or more?
&gt;If so, do I install it between the batteries and the connections on the

&gt;or does it go between the aux. battery and the outlet I will plugging

It's always a good idea to use a circuit breaker, but if you are careful
with your wiring you can probably get by without it.  Keep a fire
extinguisher handy though.  :)  If you want to buy a nice circuit breaker,
West Marine has them.  Up to 125 amps, I think.  Maybe 150.  Should be okay
as long as you don't let the aux battery drain all the way down.  I would
just go with fuses after the aux battery, unless your inverter is really huge.
