Subject: RE:  larger tires

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
if you have 165s on your bus it sounds like you have 15&quot; bug rims.   If
you
find a set of 15' bus ims you can use a wider tire, and have better
handling.
  I have 205  75 15s on my 61- any wider and I'd have problems changing
the
tires.   The tires are tall- which gives me more distance per RPM (or
would
if the thing was still on the road) The 15&quot; bus rims have 4 wide slots
in
them.  
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Now there's a useful piece of info.  So I do indeed have legit bus rims
on my 58 single cab (although the spare must be a bug rim cause it don't
have any slots at all).  Am I correct in assuming these are 4.5 inch
wide rims?

Thanks.
