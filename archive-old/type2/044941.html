I'm confused.  Why does it say &quot;sighnoff&quot; for subscribing to this H2O
mailing list?  And any ideas how many members to the list?  I'm sure
the list has a web page...
TIA

Here you go. There isn't much traffic on it. Sometimes not for weeks,
unless
someone asks a question. This is how to sign off. I don't remember how
I
signed on. But common sense tells me if you send a subscribe H2O-VW to
the
following address that should work.

To sign off from the list, email to listproc_at_listproc.sjsu_dot_edu with
the
following
request:

signoff H2O-VW
or
unsubscribe H2O-VW

Let me know if it doesn't work.

&gt;Just a though but I'd like to know what's involved in the restoration
&gt;of a VW Rabbit.  Are parts hard to find?  &lt;BG&gt;  I happen to like the
&gt;first Generation of the Golf :^), the second generation is good too.
&gt;That latest versions are terribly heavy but look wonderful.  Are
there
&gt;any Mailing lists or Newgroups for any Watercooled VW?
&gt;TIA!  TTSYNT!!!  :^)
