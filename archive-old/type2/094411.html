Subject: Thermal Electric Bus????

The 'fridge went out in my Scamp and I've been looking at these thermal
electric coolers and wondering how they work?  I'm sure someone on this list
can explain it in terms even I can understand.

Next question, I know these new 12volt coolers don't take as much energy to
cool as a 'fridge with compressor and coolant, so would it be possible to
put together a large enough unit so that with a solar panel, the bus could
be kept cool during the day with the sun shinning?

I'm sure the windows would have to be blocked to keep out as much heat as
possible, but it sure would be nice to keep the bus cool with the power of
the sun.

Just thinking outloud, tell me I'm crazy, everyone else does!!

Thanks for any info.
