George,
   Thanks for the heads up.  Maybe I'll try a string of white lights on a 
green wreath mounted on the nose.

&gt;George replied: Cops sometimes don't show much christmas spirit if you 
&gt;display red lights to the front or white lights to the rear.  They don't 
&gt;like blue lights at all, and green is somewhat iffy.  Flashing lights are 
&gt;also somewhat suspect.
