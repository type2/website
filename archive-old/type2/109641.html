Subject: Re: [T2] Still on about the Oil Pump

I bought the busdepot Melling pump a couple years ago for use on my 2.0L
rebuild. Here is why I did NOT use it.

1) The Melling pump was less than 2mm away from the BOLTS on my
'Torque-Special Cam'. Now, I could of found smaller bolts or machined the cam
gear or I could of just bolted it on and hoped for the best. I didn't feel
comfortable doing so.

2) The oil intake and exhaust ports on the Melling pump were extremely larger
than the oil gallery holes in the case. I just kept thinking of the funnel
affect as ALL this oil was being forced into a little tiny hole. I could of
machined the case to larger holes or I could of just bolted it on and hoped
for the best.  I didn't feel comfortable doing so.

So, what did I do? I got out my measuring tools and checked my original pump
for wear. I cleaned it extremely well and bolted it back up to the NEW motor.

I have had ZERO problems. I have hooked it up to an oil pressure gauge for
about 100 miles and my pressure is well within spec.

FWIW, YMMV

&gt; with the type I pump.  With a type IV pump, I don't see why the cam
&gt; gear would make any difference, since the only part that interfaces
&gt; with the pump is the slot in the side.  It's been a while since I
&gt; looked at it though, so I can't claim absolute knowledge.
