&gt; I am going to purchase a head temp and oil pressure first. Later on I'll

&gt; on provisions for three. I am not really sure where I want to mount them
&gt; yet. Where are yours mounted and how do you like them there?

I plan to mount three of my gauges in a trim bezel sold by Bus Boys (about
$18), installed in the radio hole in the dash (minor trimming of radio hole
will be needed to accommodate the gauge bodies), the other three will be in
another trim bezel in the dash under the radio hole.
