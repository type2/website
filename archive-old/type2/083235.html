Subject: windshield replacement

ok guys, i have ordered my windshield here locally and
they are delivering it 150 bucks with factory uv and
tinted at the top, sounded like a good price to me.  i
have installed a flat bug windshield before and don't
think the bus will be that much different if it is
then tell me.  my question is that i will be taking it
back out in about a month, hopefull 2 weeks and i
wanted to know what was the best way to take it out
without ruining the seal?
