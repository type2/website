TAC: Thermostatic Air Cleaner.

What is the VIN number for your bus? As Karl pointed out to me, if the chassis part of your VIN (last 6 digits) is 077584 or less then the cross over pipe on your exhaust system will allow for the attachment of two hoses, one of which will go to the air cleaner in order to pre-heat the air when the car is cold.

http://www.bug-bits.freeserve.co_dot_uk/ramva/fiche/t202310.gif

In that diagram, item 24 has the preheat pipe, item 24a doesn't (later VIN).

If you have a later VIN, and don't have that pipe, or have that pipe from a donor bus you'll need to fight the smog system because as Karl has pointed out many times, they don't seen to know when FI busses stopped using thermostatic air cleaners.  The smog referee who did my bus didn't insisit I have it although the sticker he put on my bus indicated I need it. Go figure.

The same VIN range determines which EGR system you are supposed to have (electrically or mechanically activated).  It sounds like you have the 077583 and earlier kind.

&gt;1st  EGR valve:  What I have done with this is first I noticed the
&gt;vacuum hose itself was clogged, so I unclogged it.  Then I began
&gt;following the instructions for testing the EGR valve that my manual
&gt;suggests.  I tested the throttle valve switch and determined it is
&gt;functioning as the manual suggests it should.  I could not find the
&gt;double relay so I didn't check that. 

See the 3 boxes on the firewall? The double relay is the one on the bottom left:

&gt;Failed Emissions:  The co part of the emissions test passed. The HC part
&gt;of the emissions was way high.  The catalytic converter that was on my
&gt;VW was totally broken.  I bought a new one and installed it.  

These are possible reasons the HC level can go too high:

* Incomplete combustion due to fouled spark plugs.
* Improper timing or dwell
* Damaged ignition wires
* Poor compression
* Vacuum leak
* Too rich, faulty AFM/ECU

If everything else checked out then an inoperative cat and the lower HC limits for cat equiped vehicles seems a valid reason.

&gt;The mechanic also told me he needed to adjust the air flow meter and
&gt;that it could possibly need to be replaced.  This is another problem
&gt;that I have not been able to find referenced in my shop manuals.  

Did he give another other reason? Your %CO levels were ok so I'm confused.
