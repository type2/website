Subject: Re: [T2]oil filler cap seal

&gt;From: Faster-Laster

&gt;hey chris, the fact that the filler piece turns might be your problem.
&gt;Look at the metal piece. notice that notch (there might be 2 I don't
&gt;remember). There is a matching piece on the inside of the plastic
&gt;fillter part. it has to be rotated correctly before it will slide down
&gt;all the way. Your problem might simply be it's not pushed down all the
&gt;way.


So no seal? I did not remember ever seeing one.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
