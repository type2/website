Paul:

Hmmmm...  I like that hypothesis, and I suppose that could be one way it
would happen.  They are constructed out of brass to minimize that kind
of thing.  It's a bellows-like thing, I'm told there is some type of
alcohol inside that is liquid at room temps, boiling point at the temp
stamped on it, so the vapor expands the bellows, which then pushes the
vane device open on a T1, or relaxes the cable and allows the impeller
housing flap on a T4 to go into &quot;hot mode operation&quot;.  I &quot;believe&quot; the
failure mode (fully expanded) is due to fatigue somewhere in the
bellows, the fluid exits and voila - it's a deader in the failed open
position!

Corroded shut from some nasty beach exposure?  Salt water immersion?  I
only got through O-Chem in college - not a materials guy, so I'm
wondering myself...

Having not even seen a picture of said thermostat my best guess would be
corrosion would be the cause of a VW thermostat failing shut.
