Subject: Re: [T2] point gap - who is right???

George,

Yep, on Points, dwell never lies and I generally get great 
performance and mileage when running stock points....however...back to the 
pertronix argument that the dwell on an electronic unit doesn't make 
much difference.

Mine runs about 44 degrees, and I don't like it there....seems like the 
bus is a little slugish....and *no* amount of adjusting anything will 
change it.

My mental processes area little slow this morning as I am still on
German time from my trip(more on that later...with pics!)....so, if I have 
forgotten where that discussion on dewll and electronic points went, pleas 
forgive me.

Cheers, dave

&gt; What matters isn't the correct gap, but the correct dwell angle, which is
&gt; what the coil requires to work properly.  Due to the variance in point
&gt; rubbing block material and contact shape the actual gap can vary widely,
&gt; but dwell never lies.  Any of the gaps abover are sufficient to get the
&gt; engine running, and often to have it run well, but for best results you
&gt; need to put a dwell meter on the coil and adjust to the optimum dwell
&gt; spec.
