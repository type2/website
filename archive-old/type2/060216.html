Subject: dead bus reply

Hi Volks!
    In response to Jeff Brock's dead bus problem, you might want to check for any short circuits too. I had a similar experience while going to a Woodstock reunion in NY. My dad and I were driving on the NY Thruway when the engine just stopped. We tried shifting it,but nothing.We pulled over to try and change batteries(always carry a spare)when my dad noticed a wire sparking.He grabbed it(burnt thumb)and luckily could fix it with a wire nut. It has happened one other time since with another wire. Someone did not know how to wire it properly,but she's o.k. now. I'm lucky that my dad is both an electrician and mechanic.Good luck!
