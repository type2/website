well they never get &quot;good&quot; gas mileage, figure with that engine if you get

can think of a number of reasons.... most do not require an engine rebuild

could be someone doesn't know how to adjust hyd valves and did it wrong
and they aren't opening.

&gt; this would be great. 

where in Baltimore, I'm on the NE side of town

mine took about $2,500 two years ago, did most of the grunt work myself.

&gt; baltimore took me from 9:00pm Saturday to about 6:00 today(sunday)

that's actually not bad time, but I would have taken the train
