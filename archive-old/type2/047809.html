Subject: [T2] Electrical problem won't start

Hi,
My generator light has been coming on for the past few weeks when I turn the 
bus off.  I replaced the regulator and it still did it.  I have been 
disconnecting the battery everytime I parked. I finally decided to hope it 
was an electrical problem and disconnected the worst of my unneccesary 
electrics, well I found the problem I think when I disconnected the stereo, 
light went out.  However when I was screwing the fuse block back up, I 
noticed two black wires (factory) connected to one spade but the one side of 
the spade was bent back and had come loose from the fuse block.

Well to speed this up the bus doesn't start now just click, and I don't know 
where the  spade is supposed to go.  I replaced the end but does any one 
have any idea which terminal it is supposed to go in.  1, 7 , and 12 each 
have one terminal open.  I looked thru the Bentley and at the diagram of the 
fuse block but can not find any thing relating to starting on it.  Any 
ideas.

This is on the 73 SnoopyBus.

I was doing this in the parking lot before work. So I got to fix it to get 
home.  Any ideas would be appreciated.

TIA

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
