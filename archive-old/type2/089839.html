&lt;&lt; Get a copy of Tom Wilsons book, How To Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Cooled
Engine.
Don't get the shaft on E-bay they are only about 14$ on Amazon and
sometimes they pay delivery.
Full retail is only $17.95 &gt;&gt;

Try my favorite book site:

&lt;&lt; www.addall_dot_com &gt;&gt;

For new and used books...Listed by price including shipping. Even if the
book isn't available, they'll notify you when one of their hundreds of
book stores gets a copy...:-)
