I assume you will going along the electric pump route to feed these?  Not
high pressure though.
Interesting idea as long as one can fabricate a proper inlet manifold
adaptor to accomodate side draught.
They can be inclined to a fair angle (a la' Daimler V8)
as long as the float chambers are level.  Heat should not be a problem.
I used to work on E types many years ago and we never had too many problems
with vapour locks.  I am sure I have seen race equipment or kit car
catalogues with 'universal' linkages.  One I recall was converting a single
cable into twin cables at a
pivot point, the cables then going to their respective carburettor.
SU's are a doddle to tune with the right gear.  Usually a piece of 12 mm
hose is as good a start
point as any with a twin set up.  Hear the roar!!  Need a long bit in a VW
though!
Some later models were allegedly tamper proof but they can be worked around.
Best of luck.  BobW
