Subject: My dilema: Buy a '78 bus or a truck

Hey everybody. I need some advice. I'm a 17 year old in Seattle. I own a 
'72 campmobile with dual carbs, which is for sale and a '79 rabbit.
I don't know much about cars. It has been difficult working on my bus 
but the idiot book has helped alot.I love buses and am looking for a new 
car. My uncle says I should buy an older truck which would be easy to 
work on and I could put a camper on it. I don't know what to do. I am 
interested in a '78 bus in good condition. Its got 80,000 mi., a 
new clutch and and the interior is in good shape. It also has hydraulic 
valve lifters. Is this bus easy enough for me to maintain or should I go 
eith the truck. Has anybody had any experience with campers on the back 
of trucks. Is this as nice as a bus? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!
                  Simon
