I have a &quot;brand new&quot; combustable heater for sale.  This unit is brand new and complete. 
Details: This is a Southwind 978M.  It has all fuel lines, exhaust parts, all fittings, control box that mounts under the dash.  This is a 20,000BTU unit.  Has wiring harness, the only catch is, it is a 24V unit, but the only thing required to convert it to a 12V would be to change the blower fan.
If you are at all interested in this unit please respond to this e-mail.  We are asking $1000.00 or, will consider a trade for a running VW bus/camper.
