&gt; At BBBX, there were a few guys with Bays that they had painted with pickup

&gt; Wow.  I can't imagine that would improve our already 'less than stellar'
&gt; aerodynamics.

I don't know.  The texture was only about 1/8&quot; tall, and the boundary
layer on a bus is considerably thicker than that.  In fact, textures are
often used for drag reduction, IIRC.
