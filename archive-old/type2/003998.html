sounds like a major vacuum leak to me!

even if you can just about spin a wheel by hand, this is insignificant as
far at the motor is concerned...so I think maybe you'r on a red herring
there....


could be other power-lossy things, like ignition leads the wrong way round,
dizzy cap on wrong way, valve probs or timing...


I dunno just some ideas

&gt; Volks:
&gt;
&gt; While trying to take the maiden voyage today I had some trouble.   I
&gt; could never get over 20mph.  Severe drag somewhere.  I had to feather
&gt; the clutch just to get that fast.  I thought stuck brake.  All the
&gt; wheels spin by hand.  Not well, but spin.  No noticeable play in the
&gt; wheel bearings.  She has been sitting for some time now.  I tried to
&gt; adjust the stars, but can't get 'em to budge.  Gonna remove the drums
&gt; tomorrow after I find a 46mm socket.  Any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt; thanks
