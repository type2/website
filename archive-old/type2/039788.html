Subject: Free AC Parts 

Time to clean out the garage - the landlady is giving us the boot cuz she
wants to move in!  D'oh!

Anyway, I've got some air conditioning parts that I removed from my '79
Westy.  There is a dashboard unit and some sort of fan assembly that
mounts under the bus.  Not sure how it all works, if it works, or what
other parts are needed, but these two items are available for free if
somebody would like to pick em up.  I live in Berkeley, CA, just email for
more info.  Sorry, won't ship these, they be heavy!
