had the engine rebuilt by a perfectionist, (bottom end, I did the top
end) only thing special he did was hone in a new Melling oil pump I got
&gt;from RMMW to spec.


oh I use (after the first 3,300 mile breakin) 5-50 weight synthetic but I
don't think this has much effect.  I did a test right when I changed from
dino to synth to see if there was a difference and in a long day on the
road there was no measurable difference in either the oil temp or presure.

I'm up to over 15,000 now on this rebuild and the oil presure remains the
same.  (this BTW is a daily driver in the mid atlantic area)
