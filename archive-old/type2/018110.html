   I installed one today, on my 68. It took about 6 hrs, 1 to strip all
the old canvas and the hardware, 5 to put on the new one. Ordered mine
&gt;from PLF, very pleased,  looks good quality-wise. We got a custom color,
only a little more for that. A cordless screwdriver worked great for all
those little screws, but I did need a regular screw driver in the
corners, and also used one of those ratcheting palm thingies. Also used
stainless staples, those things cost almost 4 times the regular ones,
but shouldn't rust. I'll post some pics on my site when I get 'em.
