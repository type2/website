Subject: Re: Idle problem

ahh yes...I forgot to mention the vacuum assist brakes.  Ted, you have a 71
also, correct?  (NICE bus by the way :)  this could be part of your problem.
I've gone through mine already and no vacuum leaks are present...its just some
odd thing with my fuel filter and maybe the pressure the pump puts out to the
carb....I don't know....odd... but if i change my fuel filter, the problem goes
away...  no harm in changing a $1 part is there?

&gt; Since you have a 71 you have power assisted brakes and they are vacuum
&gt; operated. You might check your vacuum line for any leaks since this can
&gt; cause the problem you described also. Hope this helps.

&gt; &gt; Hi there Ted,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have this happen to me every once in a while also with my '71 bus.  I
&gt; run a
&gt; &gt; fuel filter between my fuel pump and carb, and after about 2000 miles it
&gt; will
&gt; &gt; start giving me trouble.  When i put on the brakes to come to a stop, my
&gt; idle
&gt; &gt; will drop considerably and the engine will even want to quit sometimes.
&gt; Try
&gt; &gt; replacing your fuel filter.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I seem to remember you were fiddling around with your idle cutoff solenoid
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; Detroit?  Are the threads stripped out on the carb?  Mine are, and i had
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; problem from about Chicago to Detroit and i finally figured it out the day
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; left to come back to WI.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hope this helps...
