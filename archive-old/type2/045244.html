Subject: Re: [T2] Problem with dual 34's

Does not the proceedure for sycronizing the carbs call for it to be done at a
steady RPM of between 2000 and 3000 RPM, rather than at idle?  This is how I've
done it on a 54 Hudson with twin carbs, various 2 - 4 carbed motorcycles, a few
E-type Jags I was the tuner for, 356 Porsches, 912 Porsches, Type 3 VWs, several
type 4 carbed busses, and I don't remember all of the others.  Works easy and
gives steady reading that way.  All with a Uni-syn.  The mercury filled
manometer, and a set of vacuum guages will work at idle.  Just do not &quot;Blip&quot; the
throttle or the mercury will pass through the engine and render the manometer
useless.  The problem with a set of vacuum guages is calibrating the two.

Keep smiling,

Mike
