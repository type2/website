&gt; I have a 73 Westy with a bad motor.  I have access to a 79 motor,

&gt; 
&gt; Q1:  Will the 79 motor bolt into a 73 van w/o any mods?
 
    Pretty much -- some tin might be different.
 
&gt; Q2:  Should I install the 79 FI equipment in the 73?

    Yes, definitely!
 
&gt; Q3:  Will the 73 dual carbs bolt onto the 79 motor?
&gt; 
    Probably, but the FI is better. I believe the FI engines have a
different cam than the carb engines and carbs run too rich at low speed
and too lean at high speed.

 To do the FI swap I know I'll have to put in the new fuel pump, new
fuel
&gt; tank, the brain and the rest of the FI equipment. Am I missing
&gt; anything???

    Some wiring differences, but it's not hard to adapt. Just look very
hard at the wiring schematics in Bentley for both buses. Cut off the
wires that go to the bus side of the double relay from the donor vehicle
if you can to get the right plug and then just splice in the wires.
