&gt; I can't believe how rare VW busses are
&gt; around here!  I could have had my pick of several for under $75 each in San
&gt; Diego...

Bus trannys are real popular with the buggy building crowd here in the 
Midwest.  I've sold/traded three Bus trannys in the past couple of years 
(two were to get Busses back on the road), but they are getting more 
difficult to locate.  Prices seem to run from $100 - 200 on average.  Of 
all the salvage yards in the area, I know of only a half-dozen Bays.  
This of course excludes the big VW only yards in Freeburg, MO and 
Kingston, AR.  Now, finding a Vanagon tranny is a whole 'nuther story ...

Best of Luck in your search David. :-)
