Subject: Re: [T2] Auxiliary batteries

&gt;I was thinking about replacing it with a deepcycle battery that would let
&gt;me run some health equipment while camping ALL NIGHT long....

I do. I run a deep cycle marine battery. I camped for 3 nights at Zumwalt 
Campground in Oregon. Oregon Country Fair! ALways the best time I have every 
year......

Anyway: Over the three days I ran lights at night inside the camper, I  used 
a 12 volt cooler to keep things cold periodically, I charged 4 d-cells using 
an inverter, and also charged 4 AA bateriies as well. I played the stereo a 
little bit, and ran the electric pump to push water out of the sink (I 
installed a electric pump cause hand pumping seems silly) and I recharged my 
cell phone.

After 3 days of this, the bus started right up.
