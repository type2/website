Subject: Re: [T2] Bus spotting: hulkamania

&gt; &lt;&lt; Can anyone confirm or deny what I think I've been seeing: in the ads for
&gt; the
&gt; Hulk movie, you see part of a yellow &amp; white bus behind and uphill of Hulk
&gt; as he smashes the street. I've seen it a few times, and my wife saw it too
&gt; and said: look at the yellow bus!  Mine's yellow &amp; white, and has hulk

I just saw the movie and a white-over-yellow Bay plays a prominent role in the
set of one scene. I can't quite remember, but I think it was 'squeeking' as it
approached the Hulk. I'll have to get the DVD when it comes out to really see
what was going on in that scene.

-Eric
