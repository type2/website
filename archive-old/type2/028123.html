&gt;&gt; Remember, in a correctly adjusted bus, you cannot see the horizon in the

Because you sit pretty high in these vehicles and your line of sight is
naturally a little toward the ground. They did not bother trying to overcome
this. They figured that seeing cars on the ground behind you was adequate
and surveying incoming air traffic was unnecessary.  :)
