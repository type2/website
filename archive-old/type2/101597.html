Subject: deluxe from Berkeley, broken on bay bridge last night?

Hello,

Sorry for the list-wide email...

If the owner of a perfect Deluxe model transporter that broke down last 
night on the bay bridge is on this list, email me back.

For others, I was driving home across the Bay Bridge, because I live on 
Treasure Island, and saw a deluxe model stalled in the far right lane prior 
to the TI exit. I waited at the exit (it was too late to stop to help) for 
Cal-Trans to push it to the exit.

When they did, there was a cop car there as well. I approached the bus 
owner, mentioned that I lived right here on the island and have all kinds of 
spare parts/tools to get him going again..

Well, before I could say another word, I had a flashlight in my face and 
this tiny woman (barely over 5 ft, no wonder she became a cop!) said &quot;get 
your hands out of your pockets&quot; and &quot;what are you doing here&quot;

What a clueless tawt, this guy is in his 25YO car, and there is my exact 
same model 25YO car, what the hell do you think? sheesh.

I explained I lived here on the island, have the same car, and have any 
parts he may possibly need, when I was told &quot;this is a free service, get 
lost.&quot;

I drove home and got the wife's GTI instead, and circled back when they 
finally left, but he had already placed it up into the towtruck, and they 
were getting ready to pull away.

I said I was sorry but the police made me leave, and he started to talk 
about them warning him about not talking to anyone wanting to offer help.

I mean, if I didnt have my same exact car right there, or was offering to 
help for money or something, thats one thing, but I explained rather well 
that I had parts, and the same car and just wanted to help.

I was pissed, so I went home and started the call rolling on an official 
complaint against this officer. I would be willing to guess if I had a 
little honda and offered to help because I have some Honda parts, she would 
have been a little less agro towards me.

In either case, telling someone who wants to help a fellow bus owner out to 
&quot;get lost&quot; is uncalled for, and ill be sure that this little agro woman 
finds out from one of her higher ups.

grumble grumble...
