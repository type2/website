Subject: re: [T2] Lifetime warranty rant (was RMMW)
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have spent enough time on the phone trying to get
warranty related information and missing parts (such
as bolts and gaskets for muffler installation) from
RMMW, that it would have been cheaper to go downtown
and have the local FLAPS order the stuff, than to have
had the cost of the phone bill to deal with.  It has
taken 10 minutes or more on hold before getting to
talk to a person, and then they can't help, so another
10+ minutes, etc.  Not worth it.  Forget the &quot;Lifetime
Warranty&quot;.  Deal with one of the companies who are on
the list (Busdepot, OldVolks, Aircooled_dot_net, etc., or
some of the others. I've also had good luck with
Wolfsburg West, Vintage Parts, etc.)  I often think
that a free glossy catalog means high prices and poor
service.
