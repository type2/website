Subject: Re: [T2] Filtering fuel

In the long run, your fighting a loosing battle. Pull the tank, and
clean/de-rust or replace it. You may have 20 pounds of junk in there! (or
more) And your getting less than an ounce out at a time.

Subject: [T2] Filtering fuel


&gt; I've been suffering from crud in the fuel tank for the last couple of
&gt; months. Fuel filters are lasting about 50 miles if I'm lucky.
