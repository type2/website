Subject: Re: [T2] Help finding parts


&gt;Another thing I'd like to do is paint it.  It's the original white and if
&gt;you wipe your finger on it some of the paint comes off on your finger as
&gt;powder.
&gt;
&gt;I've never had to paint a vehicle before.  Does anyone has any advice on
&gt;what's best to do for these old VWs?  I want to strike a balance between
&gt;cost and returning it to it's original lustre.

I repainted mine just this summer... what you'll need most is patience, it 
can be a real pain. I didn't bother sanding it down to bare metal, but you 
want to rough up the smooth finish so that new paint will stick. Do that 
with wet-and-dry sandpaper. Don't quote me on this, because I'm fuzzy with 
numbers, but I went over it three times, first with 110 grain, then 220, 
then 440(?). That should be rough enough to hold paint but smooth enough to 
come out nice and glossy.

Then, the painting itself, which isn't so bad. Paint about like you'd paint 
anything else, spraying smoothyly and evenly. Too little will show through 
to the old paint (only a problem if you change colors, I suppose) and too 
much will run, so you may want to experiment with the spray on a block of 
wood first. And for the love of Pete, mask off your handles and windows and 
so forth /carefully./ I did the bottom half myself and had the top done 
&quot;professionally,&quot; and I use the word loosely. The shop masked horribly, and 
got the top half's white on the door handles, spots on the windows, and even 
missed a spot. Professionalism isn't just a string of random noises, it's a 
word, with meaning! Be careful, and your bus'll look like a million bucks.

And, this may be obvious to everybody, but buy the right color paint if 
you're trying to match. My bus is without the paint code, and the shop 
couldn't match it perfectly. Looked pretty bad with '78 Chrome Yellow on the 
side panels and the original yellowish on the top.
