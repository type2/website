You forgot the part about wipe an inch off the stick before you show it to
your customer then pinch them for a quart of oil.

Phil,

Back in the days that I worked at a &quot;service&quot; station when the &quot;attendant&quot;
did all of that for you, here is how it worked.

Grip handle, pull stick out while at the same time holding your &quot;red rag&quot;
around it tightly down as you pulled it out.

Reinsert, wait  1/2 second and pull and read.

Always read VW's with flat side down cause you are at an angle...you will
get false reading with the flat side up.

Cheers, dave

&gt; This question is almost too stupid to ask...but ow do you read your

&gt; 
&gt; BUT, if I take a reading with the flat edge of the stick facing up (you
&gt; know) I don't seem to get the same reading as with the stick facing
&gt; down. Maybe as much as a pint's difference.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know which is the most correct reading, up or down...or am
&gt; I just imagining that there's a difference?
