Mark your calendars!

The Dutch VW Bus Club will celebrate it's 5th anniversary in June 1999.  So
if you happen to be in the vicinity of Holland (the real one in Europe) you
are cordially invited to join us for the weekend of June 4-6 for our club
get together in the small village of Borculo (quite close to the German
border). We expect about 150 busses and there will be a special activities
for the younger children.

It's still early days but I thought it would be good let you know so you can
work it in to your holiday schedules and book accommodation on planes, boats
and trains (don't forget to check in your bus!)

You're all invited, but realistically we expect more German, Belgian and
possibly UK bus owners than say New Zealand or Aussie visitors! BTW most
people in Holland speak at least some English so you won't be at a loss.

If you're interested let me know but there's no hurry. We'll have plenty of
space to accommodate you all.
BTW. There will be a charge of approx. $30 dollars for the 2 nights (covers
campground, water/showers, electricity).
