&gt; I am having trouble tracking down a lighting bug on my 78. 

ah the fun

&gt; When the headlights are turned on the left front turn filament is on full.
&gt; The left blinker does not work when the lights are on. When I looked closer
&gt; night I found that the problem is back. The obvious area is the flasher
&gt; relay but it tests out OK. 

had the same problem for dern near 3 years before I finally solved it.
turned out to be a leak between two wires and the panel behind the fuse
block.... try reaching under and pulling the turn sig relay toward the
steering column a little bit.  have someone keep a hand on a loose battery
terminal to pull the plug if anything goes pop.

if the pulling has an effect you have found your problem.
