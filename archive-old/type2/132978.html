Subject: Re: [T2] Painting wheels with POR

Phil,

I've had good luck with brushing it on, never used air yet as it scares 
the ever living daylights out of me just thinking of it in aerosol form.

I've generally put it on too thick and let it drip off of the piece
I was working on.  I have generally been very pleased with the results.

I have used spray on silver paint from the local hardware store with what 
I consider excellent results.  5-10 years before it looked bad.
Got comments from fellow vdubers about &quot;how did you do that so well?&quot;

Make sure they wheels are really clean, sand them down a little  and then 
wipe them down with mek or something do make sure&quot;all grease and tar is 
gone.  I use masking tape and newspaper to mask off the tires and then 
paint away!

*Do* check around for powder coating, I can't imagine it not being 
available somewhere close.  I did 5 bus wheels last year for $25 each...it 
was worth that just to get them all sandblasted!

Cheers, dave

&gt; This is such a basic question it doesn't look like anyone has ever asked it
&gt; before...
&gt; 
&gt; How well does POR apply with a brush ? Is it a nightmare for brushmarks ?
&gt; Is the colour UV resistant ?
&gt; 
&gt; We don't have POR readily available in the UK but a catalogue offering it
&gt; dropped through the letterbox last night. Having read how marvellous it is
&gt; here so many times, I wondered if it might be the solution to my wheel
&gt; problem. I don't want to take the tyres off, don't own a suitable spraygun
&gt; so if I use it, it will have to be by brush. I'm pretty good with the brush
&gt; though so it doesn't worry me.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, and I can't get anything powdercoated locally either so this isn't an
&gt; option.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the help. Any other wheel painting suggestions appreciated. No
&gt; chrome though, I'm not kewel enough for this :-)
&gt;
