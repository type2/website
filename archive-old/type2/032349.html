Subject: Aux. heater blower...anyone need one?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SUN.3.96.990707002206.15589A-100000_at_grex.cyberspace_dot_org&gt;

I have an auxiliary heater blower, the kind that hangs from the roof of
the engine bay on late-model loafs.  I'm never going to use it, so I
thought I'd see if anyone else can.  It's complete, even has the little
plastic flapper doors in the outlets, but it doesn't run.  An ohmmeter
check shows no continuity, so either the motor has an open winding, or the
brushes are bad.  I'm willing to give it for nothing to anyone who can use
it, though I could use any of the following items in trade, all for a '75 
van: 

	- a good set of engine door hinges
	- a front door lock cylinder
	- a headlight switch with a good dimmer (the dimmer wire on
		mine broke, shorted, and tried to catch fire)
	- a rear window defogger pull-switch
