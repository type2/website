Subject: BBBIV Thanks


  I would like to thank everyone who posted pics of
BBBIV so quickly this year. Unfortunately, I was not
able to make the event this year due to Back Surgery
last Tuesday. Man, what a bummer that was. The surgeon
said that when I had my 'accident' last August, I had
broken a vertebrae and had several bone chips floating
around causing the problem.
I had planned on driving my 79Westy this year instead
of my 67 Sundial as in years past. Big bummer.
Sorry to have missed so many of my friends. Oh
well..maybe next year...or maybe Jerome!! I've almost
made it to Jerome the last couple of years, maybe this
is the year.
Thanks again guys for the pics, especially the quick
posts as it was actually happening.
