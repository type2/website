Hello again list,

   I am in the process of replacing my 71 bus starter. The new rebuilt one 
came with a bushing and said that it must be installed or it will result in 
a no start. This being said I am trying to get the bushing out and not 
having any luck. Any Ideas? Does it need to be replaced?

Cheers,

Joe
71 Bus
