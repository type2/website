Subject: Starter Bolt is WAY MESSED UP

Dear List Members,

HELP!  I have done all the tests and it is time to replace my starter 
solenoid.  Got the new one home and got under the bus bottom bolt comes loose 
fairly easily.  I snug it back on and start for the top bolt.

After create a new joint in my forearm I find and it feels really funny. Only 
one flat edge.  So I get a mirror and sure enough this thing is screwed out of 
shape like I've never seen.  (I worked two summers in a fastener supply house, 
I've seen a lot.)  :-)

Anyway, I tried to take a picture with the digital camera but couldn't get 
enough good light. So I drew a picture for you all at the following link:

If after looking at my admittedly crude drawing, you have any suggestions on 
how to remove it, please let me know.  I really don't want to have to pay the 
garage to do this.

Thanks,

--kevin--
