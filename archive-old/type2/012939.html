&gt; The center consoles just set on the floors.
&gt; No need ever found to attach it to anything.

 I can anticipate a need for you to secure it.  If you were to ever be
hit or your brakes failed or whatever...if you should end up tipping over
(it's possible) that console and it's contents wll chase you or your
passenger around the cab of your bus like a rabid pit bull and bonk your
noggin.
