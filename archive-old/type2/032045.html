This is something I am posting as a favor to a friend.
That means... don't try to ask me about it--I don't know anything about
these buses!

Port Orchard, WA (near Bremerton)
Ken Franklin--16? year old kid I met on the street.
(360) 871-8493--This would be the place to direct your questions.

'79 Bus --no engine --good manual? transaxle  --decent body (I hear)
--good seats sounds like a good parts bus --$100 for the whole thing.

'71 Bus Complete--runs possibly--said it turns over and has driven in the
past? or something like that. good tires starter and some other stuff he
named that I forgot.  This sounds like one of those spend an hour or
twoand take a couple trips to the parts store kind of things and you could
probably drive it home. --$200

No I have not even seen either of these buses.
Thats all I know but it sounds good if you are in the area.  Call the
kid--whose # is listed above--for details.

Hope somebody can take advantage of this.
Dan Sweet
'79 Kombi 2.0
