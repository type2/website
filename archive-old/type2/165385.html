Subject: Re: [T2] Metal wall behind front seats

I was afraid the answer would be that they aren't easily removable/ 
installable.

Someday perhaps I'll get around to fashioning a pair of my own,  
although those rotating chairs would be nice...

Andy, How are your walls installed?  I wonder how you got walls while  
the rest of us post 76' owners got none.  Perhaps it was an option  
somewhere in the world.

Thanks for all the response,

Zack
