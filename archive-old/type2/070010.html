I pulled out a nice roof and luggage rack from the junkyard today for my '71
Westy.  Any tips on how to work these?  For instance, to smooth it out and
paint it should I send it to a shop that specializes in fiberglass camper
shells or boats?  I'm going to get my Westy body straightened and painted
soon.  Should I just wait until then and have the body shop work on it at the
same time as my bus body?  I've seen someone post to the list you should use
only a special fiberglass paint.  What about the fibers that have worn
through?  Will paint smooth this over?  

Anyone who has gone through this exercise please let me know your
experience...good and bad.  Thanks.
