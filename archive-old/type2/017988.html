Subject: how many plies in a yoko 356 tire?
Message-ID: &lt;373A1477.3336_at_ibm_dot_net&gt;

Hey all,
I suggested to a friend who owns a vw shop to get a set of the yoko
356.  I gave him some of the info from the list and the fact that the
356 is a 6 ply or an 8 ply dependant on the one you get.
He purchased the 195/75R14
The side wall says: Plies: Sidewall polyester 2, Tread: polyester 2 +
steel 2
just like the section of archived message below (for the 370)

My question is: Is the number of plies the TOTAL (ie- 2 poly sidewall +
2 poly tread + 2 steel tread = 6 plies)
I was under the impression that when we spoke about the number of plies,
it was the sidewall plies.
This tire only has 2 sidewall plies.

My friend is real happy w/ the tire, and says his vanagon is handling
great.
now i'm next in line to get a set of yoko 356 but i'm confused on the
sidewall reinforcement 

How about the 8 plies - sidewall 3 poly, tread 3 poly &amp; 2 steel ??

BTW, Hope to get a trip report from Ocracoke out soon.
thanks
michael
