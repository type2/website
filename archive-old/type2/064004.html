Subject: Re: More on gas leaks

All gas leaks are dangerous! It sounds like the gasket between the fill line
and the tank is loose/corroded whatever. I have had this problem, and the
only way I know to fix it is to remove the engine, cursing Germen engineers
the whole time, remove the access panel behind it (no small feat, the
difference between the opening and the tank is on the order of centimeters,
like say two  centimeters) and replace the gasket (I made my own). Thinking
back I wonder now if I could have replaced the gasket with the tank in car,
as I preformed this procedure 6 or 7 years ago, once. Get it fixed: gas fumes
are toxic and explosive!!!!
Dont forget to drain the tank and carefully disconnect the sending unit. this
is also a good time to clean any electrical connection (ie, to the sending
unit) that you cant get to anyother way. I also know folx who choose thsi
time to cout holes through car around the tank and rerout there heat through
the car, but I have never done this.
