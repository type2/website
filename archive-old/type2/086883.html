Subject: Re: [T2] Front axle beam - inserting unwelded leaves

&gt; As Bob says, this was more fun (NOT!) than should be legal.  What finally
&gt; worked:

and just to add to the fun,  the torsion arms not only have to be lined up
to the leaves to go on they have to be preloaded.   the trick that I used
to get the torsion arms on was to remove the rubber stop, and drove em on
with the rubber hammer while using a jack to get some preload on as I
went, then jacked the van up by the torsion arm to get it to compress
enough to get the rubber stop back in....wheeeeeeee!

&gt; The set looks like this -
&gt;                       Leaf names (for shorthand)
&gt;        _____            small
&gt;      _________          outer middle
&gt;      _________          inner middle
&gt;    _____________        outer central
&gt;    _____________        inner central
&gt;    _____________
&gt;      _________
&gt;      _________
&gt;        _____
&gt; 
&gt; What I wound up doing was inserting the two outer central leaves, then the
&gt; inner central leaf between them.  Then the outer middle leaf then the
&gt; inner middle leaf behind it.  Last, the small leaf.  The three central
&gt; leaves have very definite orientations because the set screw indentations
&gt; are in them.  The small and middle leaves do not, but I did my best to
&gt; preserve their orientation, because reversing the direction of twist on a
&gt; 20+ year old torsion member is probably not a good idea :-)
