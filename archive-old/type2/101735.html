Subject: RE: [T2] Nosecone removal

No, you have to pull the tranny to get the nose cone out.  The easiest way
is to take the engine with it.  Take the two out together without detaching
them the from each other.  Simply disconnect all the wires and stuff, take
the bolts out of the rear engine mounts where they bolt to the frame, unbolt
the tranny nose cone from the frame with the two bolts in the center (these
are obvious),  and take the two bolts loose that attach the tranny to the
frame located on the top of the tranny above the bell housing (these are
17mm, not 15 like the bolts that hold the motor and tranny together). Then
lower the two to the ground in one piece, fix the nose cone and put back.  I
think that this is the easiest way because you don't have to line the engine
back up with the tranny when you put it back in. Good Luck! And don't sell
it over a few hours of labor.  If everyone did that, no one would own
VW's!!!  Open up a cool beverage and turn on the radio and have some fun.
