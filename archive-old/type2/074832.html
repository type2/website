I have been trying to find a piece of fuel line for my 78 bus. It's the
line between the pump and the filter. I think it's 10mm but I am not
sure. I called the local VW dealer and they don't know the size or have
it.(usual thing they always say to me). Could someone tell me what size
this is? I tried going to all local stores with the filter and no one
had anything that fit. I want to call some shops further away and see if
they have it. Thanks.
