Subject: Re: Parts from a '71?

I've owned a couple '71s over the years. Here's a list of oddball parts 
to look for: front engine tin (the one behind the fan housing), left 
side intake manifold (the one with the nipple for the brake booster), 
upper master cylinder reservoir and hose (especially if you find the 
little rubber seals that go between the reservoir nipple and the hose), 
light switch (the repro unit doesn't have the right spades on it), stub 
axle (maybe not one year only but I know they changed a couple times in 
the first few years of the IRS Busses), belly pan (the one that goes 
over the mechanicals at the front of the Bus), wing windows (the back 
ones have a tendency to rust out), seat belt retractors (the ones that 
go in the middle of the front seatbelts so you don't have to deal with 
all that extra seat belt material every time you get in and out), 
original hubcaps (the repros are crap), rare options (clock, side step, 
jalousie windows, sunroof [cables, etc.], jailbars).

&gt; Subject: Parts from a '71?
&gt;
&gt; There's a 71 deluxe at a? junkyard near me that I just came across.? The belt chrome is gone and the front and back lights/lenses and the center mat is gone, and there is not a center seat.? Otherwise it's pretty complete. 
&gt;
&gt; They told me that they are crushing a bunch of cars before winter so I have about 2 weeks to get anything off of it that I might want.
&gt;
&gt; As a late bay owner, I am not sure of any parts that are hard to find or are one year only from the 71 that I should think about pulling.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have any suggestions/recomendations?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
