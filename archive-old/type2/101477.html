Subject: Re: [T2] external oil cooler

&gt; &gt; I am looking to install an external oil cooler on my 82 Westfalia.  Any
&gt; &gt; advice as to product selection or installation methods?
&gt;
&gt;Oil filter andwich plate adapter, finned plate-style cooler,
&gt;SS braided hoses with flared tubing -AN fittings,
&gt;inline thermostat, optional sensor / switch remote
&gt;cooler fan and relay, all for less than $1000.
&gt;Hose barb installations require diligent inspection.
&gt;Check that cheapo hose clamp pressure rating !
&gt;( Here in the northeast,we preheat the oil overnight:)

Spend some $$$ on an oil temp gauge and then see if you really need an 
external cooler. I'll bet if the engine is right and cooling system 
complete you won't need one.

If you do need the cooler I discovered several years back that Pep Boys was 
selling the same fan, same fan thermostat, and same cooler as CB 
Performance. You'll still need the oil stat and the sandwich cooler. Was 
effective on my Type IV powered Beetle which did not have the OEM engine 
oil cooler due to space restrictions.
