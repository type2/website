&gt;Now to get this back to some real Bus content, did Easterwood or
&gt;anyone else ever actually get one of those electric panel van bays
&gt;running

I can't speak to those vehicles, but Topher Waring runs his all electric bus
in VT,
mechanic-ed by his middle school kids.  No kidding.

Check out http://www.ocsu_dot_org/science/waring/helios.html

I'd run one in a minute.  At least until the compressed air vehicle makes
the rounds.
