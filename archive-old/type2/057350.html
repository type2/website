Subject: Bob Hoover Book

I know the sermons have been mentioned a lot lately, and that the CD idea
has been mentioned a lot also, but no one has suggested a &quot;book&quot;.

I don't know which would be cheaper to create (CD or book) but perhaps that
would be a possibility.  Since the pages are already typed, I would settle
for a printed copy of every page held together with a gem clip. :-)

St. Hoover certainly deserves the $$$ for all of his work and advise to
novices like myself.

What about sticking them back up for say one day and letting those who
truly enjoyed them print them out ourselves?
