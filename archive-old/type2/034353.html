Subject: Pumping the brakes!

Hello all, hope you all had a wonderful holiday season!

I have yet another technical question.

My bus has been very considerate about presenting me with only one
problem at a time.  It was waiting patiently while I diagnosed and
replaced a faulty starter.  Now that I have that finished, the brakes
are giving me trouble.  It started with very little pressure in the
brake pedal (very spongy).  I could usually get good pressure and a
resultant comfortable stop by pumping/cycling the brake pedal once.  I
started by checking the vacuum assist and found a major leak.  Fixed the
leak back by the one way check valve and thought that would remedy the
situation.  Not so!  A few days later I noticed a pool of brake fluid
back by my right rear wheel!!!!  Pulled the wheel and drum and sure
enough the entire inside of the drum is soaked!!!  It's not leaking as
much now but I'm sure the leak didn't just go away.  (if only it were
that easy)  It's now bad enough that I have to pump the brake pedal four
or five times before it builds up enough pressure to activate the
brakes.  If I don't pump the pedal it goes all the way to the floor.  At
the very bottom of the stroke it gets stiff and if I apply pressure the
bus stops but the brake light also comes on.  I am assuming this is not
good and try to avoid this situation by doing the pumping to build up
some pressure.  I've ordered a new wheel cylinder to replace the leaky
one and will then bleed the brakes.  I hope this is all that is wrong.
Do you think my symptoms could all be a result of the leaky wheel
cylinder?  Could some air have made it's way in through the leaky area
and be contributing to the problems?  Or does it sound like I'm going to
be looking at the servo and or master cylinder after I replace the wheel
cylinder and do the bleeding?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

P.S. I am of course limiting driving with this potentially dangerous
situation to a bare minimum.  :-)
