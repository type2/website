I haven't heard of removable thread lock.  Teflon tape I've heard of, but I
think if that dissolved, it would make an unholy mess of the head.

If there was a more permanent insert, I would definitely be inclined to do
that.  The insert kits I've seen are over $100 though, which is about the
cost of a rebuilt head...

We'll see.  It doesn't happen enough to worry that much about it.  I'll keep
an eye on it until I rebuild later this year or next.  I was more curious
about how it actually happens.

Cheers,

Tom

Tom,

Actually, a thought occurred to me....what about using
&quot;removable&quot; thread lock? This *may* be an option, but
I would certainly get more advice before doing it, as
the head temps may make it &quot;non-removable&quot;....

You might also try some teflon-tape and wrap a few
layers around the plug before installing it (again,
get more advice).

These are both temporary fixes, but might get you by
for a while.

&gt;
&gt; If it was loose on the head, it would be another

&gt; really trying to figure out what forces (vibration,

&gt; it's seat.
