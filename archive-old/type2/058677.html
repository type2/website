I had heard that someone in the UK was importing Brazilian busses.  That's
probably what these are. Unfortunately they cannot legally be imported into
the US because they don't meet DOT standards.

&gt; From the October 1998 issue of Classic Cars
&gt; page 179 quarter page ad....

&gt; NEW 1998 &quot;TYPE 2'S&quot;
&gt; 1.6 Fuel injection
&gt; Air cooled Vans, Campers, and Seven Seat Buses
&gt; from 9495 pounds ($15,467.36 in USA dollars as best I can figure) + VAT
&gt; 2 pictures: All white van and all white seven seater.... newer
&gt; vanagonish
&gt; hubcaps, otherwise you'd bet the images were taken straight out
&gt; of a mid 70's
