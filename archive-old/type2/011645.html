Hi Volks!

&gt; Which diesel does your friend install?  Is it the new

Nope, it's the old-style, non-DI Diesel.  There are
several versions around: 1.5/50 bhp, 1.6/54 bhp, 1.9/65 bhp,
1.6 turbo/70 bhp, 1.9 turbo/70 bhp (I think).  All of these
work with the Loaf conversion.  TDIs don't because,
according to him, the hydraulic lifters fail if the engine
isn't mounted standing up (it leans heavily in the Vanagon,
and hence in the converted Loaf too).

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
