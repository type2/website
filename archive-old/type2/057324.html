Subject: VW Mechanics in Oregon/Calif

I have been on the road for three months in my 1976 green Westfalia.  I hail from Tucson.  I am currently in Portland.  My bus has been running pretty well, except that with time and miles (about 1,000 miles) the points close down and get pitted, and the idle becomes very rough and it's reluctant to excelerate from 1st gear without a lot of encouragement.

Any ideas what may be causing this?  Any recommendations for a really good VW mechanic who can solve this problem for me, someone in western Oregon or northern California?

Also, I would like to find a kind soul somewhere in western Oregon or California who loves working on VW buses who could teach me how to replace points and condenser, set the dwell, set the timing,  gap points, and adjust valves.  I would like to be able to do this basic maintainance myself.  I am a pretty quick learner, but grew up basically without a father, and, as a girl, I did not have much opportunity to learn such stuff.   

I've not been working for some time so am a bit short on cash, but I could probably spring for dinner at a modest resturant for the kind soul who can spend 4 hours or so with me teaching me those basic maintainance items.

Please reply to my email address rather than to the list.

Thank you for your kind indulgence, list folks.

Jeannie
