Subject: Fix for Winshield wiper hitting Seal

hey now,

i saw a question awhile back about a windshield wiper hitting the window seal.
well, on my '74 it's been doing that a good bit recently. i was replacing
the wipers on the '77 westy today and noticed that it would hit the seal also.
then i noticed the wiper arm itself was loose. so i pried the little plastic
cap off which reveals a nut. tightened that up and guess what? it doesn't hit
the seal no more. gonna see if that helps on the '74 as well.
