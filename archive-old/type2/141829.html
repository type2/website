Subject: RE:update on my bus coming home

Sam said...&quot;I am thinking  of putting a wreath on the front of my bus has
anyone done this and how do i put it on&quot;

Well Sam, on our 71 westy we hang it on the spare tire on the nose.  I guess
you don't have that option so you'll need other ideas.
