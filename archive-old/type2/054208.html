Radar detector?   i might have use for one in my bus
so if it goes off, i need to speed up to the minimum
highway speed:)   i can see it now:&quot;Do you know why i
pulled you over?&quot;...&quot;no sir&quot;....&quot;Well, we have a speed
limit in this state, and we would like you to at least
maintain it!!&quot; 
just kiddin Blake, it is friday;v)
shelby 
73 riviera &quot;Lizzy&quot; (speeding ticket phree, and sans
cigarette lighter)
68 westy &quot;?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; It's really handy for me to have it there in case of
&gt; needing to plug in a radar detector
&gt; Otherwise its use is primarily
&gt; as a dash decoration.
