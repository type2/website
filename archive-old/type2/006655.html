FWIW,

we now carry a FI system that is superb, but pretty pricey.

There is an option for &quot;self tuning&quot;, where you simply tell the computer
what A/F ratios you want to run, under what conditions (usually TPS
(throttle position) or MAP (manifold pressure, up to 30 psi boost!), and
then you drive it for an hour. It automatically adjusts it's fuel map to
what you specified! The fact that it has a fully tunable ignition is icing
on the cake.

You can tie into head temp or oil temp, and there are a couple other
details.

It's about $1400 for the computer and &quot;self tuning&quot; option, and you have to
get a fuel pump and a few other items, but if you want the best, this is it
in our opinion!

Just know there is NOTHING WRONG with the stock FI system. Most &quot;failures&quot;
are bad double relay, bad fuel pump, clogged filter (check the one in the
tank too), and most commonly, leaky air hoses.
