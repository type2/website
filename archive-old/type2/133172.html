Subject: Re: [T2] No new Type II

Mike,

What is actually interesting on this one to me is that I have two friends 
with buses(and one in the VW business) and the both bought Honda 
&quot;Elements&quot;.

They claim that it is what VW should be doing(bus wise).

The price is definitely right.  A 78 Champagne edition bus listed at about 
$6900 and if you run that thru the inflation calculator, you come out a 
slightly less than $20,000 in current dollars(2002).

Would you buy a new baywindow for $20,000????  with the current
2.0l engine and add about $1500 for A/C?

The real question is, would anyone else?


Probably should have been a Friday topic, but I couldn't resist!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Oh well, it is nice to have the yet to be named original in the
&gt; driveway.  I came home from the grocery store earlier and a guy driving
&gt; another bay window waved at me, and I waved back.  I see the same from
&gt; the old Beetle drivers also - but I suspect the new Bus owners would be
&gt; moritified by this the same way the rice cannon exhaust equipped New
&gt; Bettle owners seem to.
