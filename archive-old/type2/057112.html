Hi there

I am a list neophyte and confirmed wannabusser. I've been looking for about 2 months and have currently narrowed the field down to two: a 72 westy and 78 deluxe westy. I need some expert advice at this point! Here are the details:

72 -- ~`190K major engine rebuild (2L) 45K ago - owner did rebuild and went to single solex. Needs new muffler and clutch. Comes with reconditioned heater boxes. Interior and paint in excellent shape, small rust spot over battery case. yellow/orange -- my favorite type2 color. Owner asking $2400.

78 0-- 204K -- taken to bare metal and repainted by owner this spring. dark blue. Interior worn but working. has sink/fridge/stove and aux propane heater under the dash (?)
HAd compression checked: 105/100/110/105 which is good for 204K miles with no rebuild but (I think) means I'd need a rebuild asap. It also needs: lower ball joints, CV joints, master brake cylinder. Owner was asking $4000 but after buyer's inspection I think I could get it for $2500. With rebuild I am still looking at $6000 invested.

The 72 is my sentimental favorite because I like the bright interior and paint but that's the kid in me. I also like the fact it still has all the little westy touches. I am worried about the carbueration (vs. FI) and valve adjustments (vs Hydraulic). I can do the wrenching but am busier than I used to be :) I am worried about a money pit in the 72. The price is right -- I can afford 3K to get it on the road and I like the vibe this little bus has.

The 78 is much more functional -- I like the bigger top area to sleep in and it has a rack on top of it for surfboards, kayaks, etc. The owner has come way down on the price and I don't want to pass up a good deal. The overall investment (~`6K) would be a much bigger stretch for me.

So -- what am I missing? What other issues are there around these two model years? Both are high miles. The 78 has spent more time on the west coast and presumably has less undercarriage rust (?. 

I need help from someone that knows more about buses than I do -- any advice/wisdom/comments/ etc. are appreciated. Maybe I need to just keep looking..

thanks. Jamie

ps. another silly point - -the driver's seat in the 78 seems to be &quot;higher&quot; than the '72 -- when I turn my heard I feel like I am looking at the top of the door instead of out the window -- why? is there anything I can do about it? I like the ergs of the 72 better mostly on that basis :)
