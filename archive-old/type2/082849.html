&gt; HP is is a (loosely) calculated figure based on Torque _at_ RPM, the formula
&gt; being:
&gt;
&gt; HP = Torque * RPM / 5252
&gt;
&gt; A dyno will measure torque and RPM, the rest is math. You will notice that
&gt; on any Torque/HP chart, the two will meet at... 5252 RPM (HP = Torque * 5252
&gt; / 5252)!
&gt;
&gt; There are some ambient factors such as temperature and humidity, etc.. that
&gt; will factor in, but not to a great degree.

These are corrections that attempt to make all tests comparable dispite
the fact that conditions did change while the engines were being swapped,
etc.

Ronnie's dyno has a big dial that measures in HP/1000RPM.  This dial
really measures torque, but the scale is calibrated to make it easy to
find power.

Ronnie will have to bring it out to BBBVII instead of the engine stand for
the raffle engine.  It'll be fun to see some real numbers!
