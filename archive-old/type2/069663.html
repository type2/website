Subject: Re: breadloaf with discs

To my knowledge, its a little more than that. The front beam from a 68
to 71 is required to get to the ball joint suspension from link pin.
Then you get the 72 ^ spindles.;&gt;)

I've gotten as far as the 68 beam on my 61; not sure about the rest.

&gt; Hey, everybody!  I just signed on to the list, and I have a few tech
&gt; questions that I know somebody will be able to answer (you Volkswagen
&gt; smarty-pantses you):
&gt; 
&gt; Putting discs up front on my '59 Panel is pretty straightforward from what I
&gt; understand: post-'73 spindles and whatnot.  Are there any 'secrets' I should
&gt; know when buying or fitting the parts?  Should I fit a servo too (which
&gt; means the whole later front beam I guess) or are unassisted disc brakes good
&gt; enough for a work truck in a hilly part of the country? (I generally carry
&gt; 500-700 lbs of mussels in the back, and I don't want them to be 'endangered'
&gt; by duff brakes. har har) Does a disc conversion automatically mean changing
&gt; the system to dual-circuit?  How much should I expect to pay for this stuff?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance.  This list makes for great reading!
