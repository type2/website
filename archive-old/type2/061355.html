Subject: RE: Idiot adjusts his valves

&gt;So the question: since it's a 4-stroke engine, shouldn't the 
&gt;valves on cylinders #1 and 3 be in the same position at TDC 
&gt;for #1?  Couldn't one feasibly open both valve covers, and reset 
&gt;valves on each side in tandem rather than hand-cranking the 
&gt;engine all the way round (i.e, #1 and #3 at #1 or #3 TDC, and 
&gt;then #s 2 and 4 in the same fashion)?

NO!  This is very wrong!  

If you look at the valves for #3 when #1 is at TDC and have a friend
rotate the engine back and forth, you'll see one of the valves (or at
least the pushrod if you've already got the valve too loose) moving
slightly (the exhaust I think, but I'm not sure).  If you look at the
same valves when you're at #3 TDC, you discover that the engine can be
rotated about 8 degrees either way without moving either the intake or
exhaust.

So if you adjusted your valves as you described, you now have 2 loose
(exhaust?) valves - 1 on the 2/4 cycle and 1 on the 1/3 cycle depending
on which TDC you used (1or3 and 2or4.)

Rotating the engine in a bus is simple.  I have always used and highly
recommend the method described in Muir's book of doing #1, rotate engine
BACKWARD 180 degrees, do #2, rotate BACKWARD 180 degrees, do #3, rotate
BACKWARD 180 degrees and do #4.  Simple.  100% accurate.

Oh yeah, and if you didn't already know, do your valves stone-cold.
Like as in overnight cold.
