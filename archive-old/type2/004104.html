&gt;a GM product with a Chilton's manual, basic hand tools and no training.


WHAAAT?  You mean say you don't like clutch installation instructions that
go.

1. Clutch Overhaul.

     1.1 Remove engine.
     1.2 Remove clutch.
     1.3 Installation is opposite of removal.

OK now for some obligatory VW content, I've only ever read my '70 vintage
printing of Muir, did it for entertainment value, I already know enough
about working on VW's, I feel the book is basically hillarious, but like
people say, it does empower a novice.  Secondly some of the pre-purchase
words ring true regardless of how old they may be, so do easy procedures
like valve adjustments, etc for a first time owner.  But do realize folks,
it only marginally applies, even in newer editions I warrent, to a late bay
window bus, and by the time you've read the book and owned a bus for a few
months, chances are YOU AREN'T AN IDIOT.  So get something else as a
supplement like for wiring diagrams and the like.  The bus Bentley is
exceptional compared to later Bentleys, but my hands down rec, buy the darn
$10 Haynes at your local Autozone, Trak, Pep Boys, whoever anbeatable for
the $$$.  The late bay and early vanagon Haynes are exceptional manuals,
lots of pictures, and ideal second reading after you feel empowered enough
from Muir.  Don't sell yourselves short, keep the learning processes going,
and as a basic rule, if you want it to run right, particularly the newer
your Bus/Van is, keep on it what came out of Hannover.
