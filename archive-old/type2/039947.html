&gt;Hi All, I am thinking of installing an electronic ignition for my 1972 bus,
&gt;it has a new 1600cc engine and runs on unleaded, can anyone recomend the

Update the whole ignition system with an early production VW electronic
ignition system. If it has a Fairchild or Telephunken module, toss it and
get the Bosch unit for much better reliability. The advance curve will need
to be verified as not greatly dissimilar than the stock motor calls for.
Some consideration as well must be given to selection of the correct spark
plugs and gap to match the higher energy provided by better combustion with
the earlier chamber design. With a little study, you can make a good guess
and be close. Then monitor for evidence of a bit too cold or abit too hot,
and adjust as indicated. Know that improved flame propogation can require
backing off the initial timing point. This best insures reliability. 

Know also that if a set of points go phuuut from lack of maintenance, you
can replace them at the side of the road and get on. If the
module/switch/coil of the electronic system goes phuuuut, well, a lesson in
synergy commences and the cost in time/money will pay for a helava big box
of points. Change something on the most successful design model ever
produced? Hate to change points? I suggest the points are not the problem,
hate is. Hate of that which is proven reliable.

If pulling a used system for upgrade, use common sence. If the terminals
are hard, cracked or heavily tarnished, or show signs of heat stress, the
protective boots are hard, split or missing, that is not the one to pull.
If it is functional now, it won't be for long. It could be the reason the
chassis is in the bone yard. The PO may have balked at the cost of repair
and said, &quot;To h_at_#$ with this, I'm goin' back to points.&quot;, and spent his
money restoring the more reliable mechanical, foolproof if maintained, low
cost, replacable switch of a more agricultural character.
