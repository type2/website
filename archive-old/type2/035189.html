Subject: 72' Bus for sale $300.00 Northern IL

I have a 72 bus for sale no engine or trans. Body is pretty soild but shows 
signs of being fixed before. Body is painted blue bottom and white top. Was 
repainted awhile back. Not sure when though.Selling bus to raise money so i 
can get my 71's nose fixed up and bus repainted. 

My 71 can be seen at

this bus. 

Thanks
