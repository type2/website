&gt; 2) Is it legal to buy a fairly new Bay window Bus from Mexico, swap the vin
&gt; tags and frame pieces and call it an American 1973 Bus?

No, that would be too easy!  The problem is that the frame of a bus is a
welded part of the body, not a separate replaceable part like the bug.
You could probably do some less-than-kosher things to accomplish the same
thing, but be very careful!  The customs people don't fool around.

 &gt; &gt; 3) Did they ever produce the Vanagon in
Mexico? &gt;

No.

&gt; 4) How about the Thing, and all the Type3 VWs like hte squareback,
&gt; notchback, etc.

Thing, yes.  the others, no.
