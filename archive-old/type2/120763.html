Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Publications?

I hate waiting once every other month for the darn thing--

Not a lot of bang for the buck--

It does have a bunch of good stuff in it---
I never have got a bad--uninteresting issue---

It's always got a pile of stuff in it that makes me drool--:&gt;)

If it arrived once a month I'd be happier--
 
E-mail message   
 
I just used the $ I didn't spend on trends or hot vws, as I really could
care less about modifying and customizing bugs or water cooled jettas. 
Vw Camper and Custom shows real people that drive real buses. The
enjoyment I get out of the magazine more than makes up for the price. 
If the US actually had a BUS ONLY mag that showed buses that actually
were daily drivers, I would subscribe, unfortunately they do not. 
Peace,
Snoopy
