Subject: Driving my bus to King Biscuit

I'm getting ready to drive my bus from Austin TX to Helena Arkansas next week 
for the King Biscuit Blues Festival October 9-11... is anyone else from the 
group going?  I'll be camping in the field behind the levee in a green '76 
Westy with Texas Classic Auto plates and Austin Air Coolers and Deadhead stickers 
in the rear window... drop on by, I'd be happy to meet you!
