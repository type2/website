Subject: Re: Women Are Fragile?

&gt;I asked him about possibly installing an oil temp gauge so I could
&gt;monitor, etc. He laughed &amp; told me I shouldn't bother, that it would 
only
&gt;&quot;scare me&quot; if I constantly monitored  the temp. I laughed at the time,
&gt;but as I was driving home the remark was sounding more &amp; more sexist &amp; 
I
&gt;got angry.
&gt;
Lori,
I can see how this could be interpreted as sexist, but don't jump to 
that conclusion yet.  He may have said the same thing to a man at the 
shop.  He may have just been making the point that when you put a gauge 
in, you all of a sudden get gauge anxiety, and you are always looking at 
the damn thing and worrying, trying to make sure the temp doesn't go 
over a certain number, etc.  I know, because I have experienced this 
myself with the oil temp gauge in my van.  So he may have been referring 
to that feeling and may not have meant anything sexist by it, especially 
since he didn't appear to say anything specifically directed at you as a 
woman or at women in general.


 I guess the stereotypes about women &amp; car
&gt;engines is still going strong........
&gt;
Unfortunately, this is true -- but you have the power to help shatter 
that stereotype :-)



&gt;PS. Re: Karl, I, too am benefitting from his generosity! (he's sending 
me
&gt;a copy of his 75 westy manual.) The list is great!
&gt;
Hear hear, Karl has helped me out a bit too!  Even offered to scout 
junkyards for rear bumpers after some idiot rear-ended me.  He's a good 
guy, and knowledgeable too.
