I know this might be hard to take but I recently became a Bay window
owner too.  I put a page together to show the condition i got it in.  I
will update as I go, link in my sig file (to main page).  I still have
the Tinkertoy, but I broke down and bought this because I fancied a
camper too.  Please forgive me O ye patrons of the vintage list.  And
for my friends on the Bay list, be assured I've many questions.
The first are:
What is the thickness of the plywood used for the floor?
Anyone make repro vent covers for a Dormobile or are they still
available?
What exactly is an SO69 interior?
