Subject: More alternator/voltage trouble

Ok I picked up a new voltage regulator today put it in and I still have a
constant light on the dash.

With the old voltage regulator I would see voltages from about 13.5 to
16.8 across the battery with the engine running.
With the new one I am seeing from about 12.6 to about 13.4

Whats next?
