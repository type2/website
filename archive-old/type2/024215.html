Subject: Source for Tranny and Axles?
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

I need to replace the tranny on my 71 Westy. The CVs are pretty bad so a 
friend suggested rather than buy separate CVs that I just look for the 
complete axles w/good CVs or redone CVs. Or the whole enchilada--tranny 
complete w/axles. Does anyone know who might sell them? Of course I'm on the 
rust coast--NJ.
