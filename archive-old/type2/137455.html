Subject: Thermostat and bracket for sale

I have a new in box thermostat part number 021 119 159 A
 and excellent no rust used bracket,correct rectangle spacer,
washer,nut and barrel nut. Only thing needed to complete the set
up would be the cable. Last time I got a cable from the local bike
shop that was stronger and cheaper than a cable from parts store.
Yes,it is the correct thermostat for a 72-79 bus!!! I purchased a couple from the dealer several years ago and this has been on the shelf since.
I will ship it priority to the 48 states for $60.00 for the complete set up. Canadians it will go regular parcel post. Paypal preferred. I also still have the egr filter for a 78 in perfect shape for $30.00 including shipping.
