Subject: [T2] Cylinder Head Paint 

Paint is paint!
I'm in the ceramic coatings business and I coat lots of Harley, Yamaha and
other Air Cooled cylinders with heat dissipating ceramic coatings.
The color is black and it prevents rust, makes the cylinders run cooler and
with the internal Ceramic coatings on the cylinder walls it breaks the
engine in faster and gives better long term compression readings because it
makes the rings fit better.
The same cylinder external coating is used on the bottom sides of intake
manifolds, pistons, rods, rocker arms, engine and transmission cases.
Yes it helps!
Cost is about $50.00 for cylinder external surfaces and $20.00 for inside
surfaces (different material).
