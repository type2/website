Charlie, I think you are grateful for all the help you received from the 
list while you were out on the road, and you want to repay the list a 
hundred times over. While there may be no right way to do the wrong 
thing, there are lots of good ways to do the right thing. You just want 
to do the right thing.

But I agree with those who have pointed out that the list is already the 
right way. If someone is out on the road and posts that they think they 
may be running hot, Al Brase will reply that he's worried they're running 
too lean a mixture. David Schwarze will remind us all for the 127th time 
that we need guages. Sean Bartnik will explain what flaps do. Even if 
that doesn't get the poster out of his or her jam, it is a constant 
reminder to the rest of us that our busses are temperamental machines and 
need care in rebuilding and in maintenance.

But there is one reason that the BRPS may be the wrong way. You aren't 
going to like what I am about to say, but ask yourself if it isn't true. 

When you posted about Steven, a lot of people pledged money to get Steven 
an engine, if needed. When John Anderson raffled a bus to help you out, 
people on the West coast bought chances, even though they wouldn't in 
their right minds go to West Virginia or wherever to was to pick it up if 
they won. 

There isn't anything wrong with that. But I suspect that sympathy and 
cash increase in proportion to how well the person in trouble is known to 
the list. And also, in proportion to how much we on the list know about 
their struggle to get their bus running right.

Lets say Joe Fournier finally gets his '77 on the road. And after a good 
long break-in period he takes a road trip. 1000 miles from home he breaks 
down. Say. We are all going to be very sympathetic and offer to help.

But lets say that Jack Lugbutt, who has been on the list for three years 
and has never said a peep to anyone, suddenly posts to the list:

&quot;Please help. My brand new GEX engine seized up and I am 1500 miles from 
home.&quot;

How much help are we going to offer Lugbutt?

Well this is a soft-hearted list. So the answer will be: more than he 
deserves. Should we take up a collection to get him a new engine?

My point is that every offer of help -- be it advice or monetary help -- 
is a judgment call. And judgment required is already well-handled by the 
list.

When H. Steven broke down in Albuquerque, you (Charlie) made the argument 
for bailing him out. You made it forcefully -- you appealed to our sense 
of honor and our guilt. You made rational arguments and you pulled a few 
emotional chains. And it worked. The money was pledged. If I weren't 
saving up for new exhaust valves, I would have pledged some myself.

The list is it, Charlie. It's up to date. It's democratic (small d). I 
doubt that it can be improved upon.
