Subject: RE: [T2] steerin gearbox

If you get a rebuild kit, you have to be certain the shop has the
special tools required to rebuild it correctly.
If they were an aircooled shop in the 60's-70's, or bought the dealer
tools, then you would be ok.
If not, you are far better off with a properly rebuilt box.

Volks, let me clarify, I've tried Bus Depot, Bus boys, BFY Obsolete, 
Automotive Machine, GO Westy, Aircooled_dot_net, BustedBus, some other 
websites that I can't remember, and a bunch of local shops and I've 
emailed a few shops in Brazil and the UK but haven't heard from them
yet... and ideally I want to find a rebuild kit.  I do know where to buy
a 
rebuilt box
thanks again,
Karen
