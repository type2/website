Rick,
    In an earlier post you asked...&quot;Usually it will restart but often it =
will=20
just click, and then I grab a screwdriver and flashlight, crawl under =
and=20
cross the starter and vroom.  What gives??&quot;

   This is the infamous Hot Start problem.  I've found that by doing a =
little starter maintenance this can be prevented.  Once a year I remove =
the starter, disassemble it, and give it a good going over.  All the =
mechanical parts are cleaned inspected and lubricated, brushes are =
checked for wear, the commutator is polished, and all electrical =
connections are cleaned.  At the same time I remove the battery and =
clean its terminal posts, clean the outside of the battery case, and =
service the water.  All the battery and starter wire terminals are =
cleaned and repaired as necessary.
    I do this once a year, and that way I get to deal with it when and =
where I want to.  You know, at home in the driveway, during daylight =
hours on a day with no rain or snow, while I'm wearing old work cloths.  =
Check your Bentley manual for specific details.
