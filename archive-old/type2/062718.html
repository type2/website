This is of course sound advice for nearly any frozen nut, and
particularly good advice for brake bleeding screws, though there
it is better to say squarely tap them 50 times with a smallish hammer.

Here's a real tough nut for you, a '74 parts bus I bought had ok front
calipers even though the bus was mostly iron oxide (beutiful interior
too and the whole thing was $200) so I tried to get off front wheels.

No go, rusted, sitting 5 years, overtorqued, who knows.  I banged, I
heated with acetylene, I tried regular breaker bar, broke a 6 pt
Craftsman socket.  In the end it took, and I don't exagerate, my
Harbor Freight 3/4&quot; drive 19mm, its 18&quot; breaker, with an 8 FOOT piece
of iron pipe, and my 230 lb frame giving it all I had, can we say
1500+ ft-lbs.  The amazing thing, they all broke free, nary a stud
sheared off (some were easier than others though).  Too make matters
worse, the calipers ended up being worse than they appeared like most
of the bus, 1 was OK the other rusted solid.
