Subject: Air Cooled Push Rod Tube Install

my method is to take the big end of the push rod tube (the 'head' end) and 
jam my thumb into it, then I feed it into the head PR tube hole with the seam 
facing up, crouch down and guide the small end into the case with my other 
hand, once I've got the small end entering the case, I push my thumb deeper 
into the tube, at about 15 thumb pounds the tube travels the extra inch or so 
home, then I reach under the motor and hold the tube in so it doesn't pop out 
when I extract my thumb. It's slightly painful after 8 times but I don't like 
using tools because of potential for leaks.
