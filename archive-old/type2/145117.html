&gt; I think that VW's market segment included a lot of upwardly mobile,
&gt; well-educated professionals who appreciated the design factors. Today this
&gt; market segment still appreciates design, but more in the sense of style than
&gt; in the sense of function. Hence the VW brand is about style and luxury and
&gt; not about cargo space.

&gt; Unfortunately there is a big gap in simple, practical, affordable and
&gt; user-hackable automotive tech. At the moment the Honda Element looks to me
&gt; most like the VW bus of the 1960-1970s. Some of Honda's concept cars include
&gt; mesh seats, laminate flooring and integral pet carriers. And it wouldn't be
&gt; much of a stretch to envision a Dormobile camper conversion on an Element
&gt; platform.

Actually, that would be a big stretch.  The Element has a fraction of the
interior volume of a bus in a much larger footprint.  You gotta pay for
those crush zones!

You're right about the &quot;practical car fans&quot; though.  Several people on the
list have acquired Scion xBs, a Freidolin built by Toyota.  It isn't a
bus, but it has the combination of huge interior room on a small footprint
that appeals to a lot of us.
