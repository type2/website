Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield washer

How would one remove the sprayer jets?? I would like to replace the whole
system this summer and the jets aren't very expensive. Should I just trash em
getting them out, or is there a more civilized way to do it. I haven't had
washers for the 8 years I've had my bus, but now I can't stop thinking it
would be sort of nice.
