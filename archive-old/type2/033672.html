Subject: Rebuild, trip report, thanks all around

Hey, gang. Two nights ago I arrived in Bethel,
Connecticut after a 2500-mile journey from Houston,
Texas that started with my first rebuild. The 1800 in
my 1974 was starting to go, and, lucky enough to be
the roommate of fellow listee and local guru Brian
Lanahan, we yanked the engine, pulled the parts up
three flights of stairs to our kitchen, and began to
work. Some brief rebuld notes:

1. Greasy engines suck. After struggling with a steel
brush in the bathtub, I gave up in disgust and instead
went with trisodium phosphate. It's a water treatment
chemical, but in thick concentrations it's a fine
degreaser. I was lucky enough to have a friend in the
chemical business, so he scarfed a fifty-pound bag for
me, and I had a big cajun cooker (the shrimp-boilin'
variety) with a fifteen-gallon washtub, so I spent
several days boiling the daylights out of all the
engine parts. Worked like a charm, save for a thin
gray film which came off easily with solvent and green
kitchen scrubbies. I'd recommend the
cajun-cooker-and-TSP method to anyone.

2. We were able to sneak an oil pressure sender into
where the oil pressure idiot light sensor usually
goes. Sneak it down in there (Lano noted sometimesy
you need to tap it a little bit farther) and cut a
pretty hole in the tin, and it looks all professional.
On the subject of senders, Lano also gave me his pride
and joy, an oil sump plate from a 914 that had the
sender installed already. Truly, a momentous occasion.
Knees knocking from fear of messing it up, I drilled
holes in the dash and installed the gauges.

3. We went up from 1.8 to 2.0. Many thanks to AVP for
properly weighted pistons and a beautiful cam. Jeff's
Bug Shop in Houston rebuilt my heads, which didn't
need flycutting but instead got ground a little bit
with the end of the cylinders and valve grinding
compound to seat properly. Jeff also offered
ridiculous amounts of advice.

4. Replace the oil pump. Another piece of Jeff-derived
advice contradicted Wilson, i.e., if the oil pump
basically has any wear on it, pitch it. After running
the rebuild and noting really low oil pressure, I
freaked out, and then replaced the oil pump, which
fixed the problem. I bought a high-volume Melling
pump, like Mike Gensler told me not to, because it was
the only one available in the area and I was leaving
real soon. It hasn't acted up .. yet.

5. I dislike the exhaust. Fortunately, turns out if
you put the engine jig for the stand on the flywheel
upside down, you can put the [completely built!] case
on the stand, and gently guide it around so it's
entirely upside down. That way, the exhaust just drops
right in. Neat! Of course, it had to come out again to
put the damn oil pump on. And then I stripped an
exhaust stud on the head, which meant it had to come
off again. Super kudos to Jeff Kitterman, who arrived
at my house in ten minutes after the stripping with
the last exhaust stud in town in his right hand. He's
my hero. Now I notice that I didn't put the stovepipe
for the heater box in, which means the exhaust gets to
come off again to install it, or maybe I can sneak by
with just the oil cooler. Damn.

6. We installed one of those electrical fuel pumps
that everyone seems all worked up about, but bolted it
somewhere under the rear bench. It clicks when the
ignition's turned. I haven't checked the pressure, but
a fuel pressure regulator sounds like a good idea.

7. Early on the engine leaked a lot, but turns out the
end of the crank where the fan bolts on was plenty
scarred and rough, and it looks like oil was sneaking
out there. After a good polishing, it's now bone-dry.
We went through an entire bottle of gasgacinch during
the rebuild.

8. The morning the leaking problem was resolved
(sunday before thanksgiving) I started driving, bits
at a time, through Louisiana, Missippi, Alabama,
Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Maryland,
Pennsylvania, New York, and wound up in Connecticut.
Crossed paths with, but never actually encountered,
Clark Gordon. Sorry! Maybe on the way back down! The
engine had been in the car for three or four weeks
before the drive, and had gone on one 300-mile jaunt
the weekend prior. Oil pressure and temp have been
gentle the whole way, I've been occasionally breaking
20 mpg on the highway, and all has been comparatively
good. I found a lone piece of fuel line that hadn't
been replaced (the driver's side gas tank venting
line) when it spurted gas all over while tanking up in
Colinsville, Alabama, and I did a tune-up in a
Wal-Mart parking lot in eastern Maryland.

Super thanks to Jeff Kitterman, Mike Gensler, Jeff's
Bug Shop, Clark Gordon and fellow listees for getting
me this far, and not much less than total worship goes
to Brian Lanahan, who spent months with me, patiently
holding my hand and throwing ungodly amounts of spare
type 4 parts at me to make everything work. May I one
day teach him something as useful and fun.

Cheers,

Ian
