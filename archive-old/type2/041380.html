Subject: Re: Loose fan belt conundrum.

the belt you need is 11.3 X 912mm, and that's the primary source of your
problem.

Catalog readers (and many others) think the generator and alternator
equipped engines use the same belt; WRONG!

The wider belt will give you adjustment, and ride closer to the center of
the pulley, speeding up your fan (and helping your cooling problem).

I'm assuming you have no other issues (wrong fan, missing tin or gaps in
sheetmetal, missing seals, etc)
