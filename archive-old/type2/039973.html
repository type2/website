Subject: The repair shop nightmare: formerly bus oil leak

Hello,

    Today I spent close to 6 hours waiting on my van (remeber? the one that was
leaking oil after a tune up).

I had my 1979 VW Type 2 AC, EFI bus tuned up at the shop about a week ago. Then
it started to leak a large puddle of oil. So I took it back to the shop and
much to my dismay they infomed me that I needed more service! AHHH! okay
alright its old and everything what's a new ring? So i got a vauge estimate
simply stating replace front ring. So I show up today, and initially I read the
full work order heres what it says:

Cdn funds
----------------------
Pulley Seal   7.95
Oring, for seal  5.85
Service material 2.78
Labour 92.80 about two hours!!!! YEESH! 

stupidly I paid for it (Im new to repair shops in general just hought maybe a
specialist would kind of know what they're doing).

So I drive away and go to the bank.. everything seems cool so i get out do my
banking and come back.... 

THERES OIL ON THE GROUND!!!! NOOOOO!

So getting angry I drive back to the auto haus and demand a redo so my car
actually works!!! I was pissed! I pull out the stupid dipstick and realize ..
they didnt put enough oil in. and then the smoke starts coming out of the
dipstick hole ( a universal sign that your oil is vaporizing (getting wayyy too
hot))  just for the book I was on LEVEL ground and the engine wasnt that hot ..
it was not a hot day out or anything. 

I storm into the office and demand that they fix this engine or give me my money
back and Ill go elsewhere. The guy started balming ME for wear and tear and 
claimed I hadn't had enough experience with a type two. WTF? SO I told him to
fix it, like now. with no other form of transport I decide to go to DQ and have
a burger to soothe the nerves. 

Then I realize maybe its time to have a little chat with the owner of the shop.
SO afetr lunch I walk back and sit down in the repair place.  I ind out the
owner is on lunch.. okay fiar enough Ill wait... two hours later the manager
comes back. The guy walks in and I tell him that Im really not satisfied with
any of the work done and that a simple tune up seems to have led to my engine
ultimately breaking down (though he denied it). So he makes me a promise to
power wash the engine and see if the leaks continue. 

twenty minutes later he comes out and tells us that there seem to be no more
leak but the left heating unit has a tonneo of oil in it and it needs to just
burn off. 
He drives it out for me and parks it on the side of the road and tells me &quot;just
dont operate the heaters until everything is burned off. I agree hoping this is
the end of my dealings with this company... I get about 4 blocks away and HUGE
amount of smoke started coming through the air vents!!! WHAT THE F****?!?!?!  I
was really pissed but realized maybe the oil was just burning off. I got my
drycleaning from the cleaners and picked up my brother to go and get slurpees.
About half way to seven eleven, there is a giant hill .. my vee dub always used
to roar up it. but now it farts and sputters and can barely do it. like there
is no compression in the enine or the tuning is totally screwed up.  totally
frustrated, I return the van to the garage AGAIN just before they closed. The
owner was there and promised to fix it. 

I am seriously worried the repair shop has botched my engine totally. :(((( It
worked so well before I brought it in and now it doesn't. What are my legal
recourses here? Should I take them to court? should I keep giving them chances
and risk ruining my prized bus?  Somebody help me, Im at my wits end. Just
explain any and all reasons for this and cite and experience you may have had.
the people at the garage are so hard to deal with because they think they can
buy me off just by listing off engine parts! Please Help.  :((

Sincere thanks :(((

Richard (aka mr. POSTAL)

I'd only go here again if my van weren't nice
they only want to overhaul your engine.
