Subject: Re: GAS

&gt; 
&gt;     Hello list,
&gt; 
&gt; The issue of oil has been covered pretty well lately but what about gas?
&gt; 
&gt; Haynes says 91 octane for the '72 bus. Here in North Carolina 87,89 and 93
&gt; are the only choices. I usually run 89 because I am a tightwad. The other
&gt; day I put about 7 gallons of 93 on tap of a half tank of 89 (avg of 91?) but
&gt; didn't notice a difference.

Uh-oh, not again.  Short and sweet, the only reason you need high-octane
gas is if you have a high-compression engine.  VWs don't (not stock,
anyway).  Haynes says 91 RON octane (which VW also said).  Trouble is,
we don't use the RON method in the US.  We use the CLC method, which is
(RON+MON)/2 (check the sticker on the gas pump and you will be forced to
agree).

91 RON = 87 CLC.  So VW says &quot;use the cheap gas.&quot;  

For more proof, see

&gt; 
&gt; There is also the question of lack of lead. This is the second oldest
&gt; vehicle I owned (runner up was a 76 Vega) Are there any special
&gt; considerations when putting unleaded fuel into an engine that was designed
&gt; when lead was legal?
&gt; 
Not after about '71(?) on a VW, that's when VW started putting in the
&quot;unleaded-friendly&quot; heads with harder valve seats (from what I've
heard).
