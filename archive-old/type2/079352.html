Subject: Re: [T2] speedo adjustment? 

&gt; Whoa!!!   Do not use the hairspring to try to make any type of
'calibration
&gt; adjustment'. You only set the needle on at the correct position once to
set the
&gt; preload of the spring. Look at the face of any VDO speedo. At about -20
mph you
&gt; will see a short white line [at the bottom of the face, to the right of
the 10
&gt; mph pin]. It will be visable just to the left of the V in VDO. That is the
&gt; calibration point of the needle. When you put the needle back on the
shaft, it
&gt; must point to that line. Then you push the needle on the shaft. Move the
needle
&gt; to the pin and gently lift it over the pin. That's all you do to set the
preload
&gt; on the spring.
&gt;

Thanks for the info Karl.  Note everybody that's why I said I don't know how
to adjust it.
:-)

The speedometer I sent off to Speedometer Plus read about 5 mph fast when I
sent it and it was dead accurate when I got it back.
I suspect that the spring weakens over time and perhaps they are putting new
springs in (I didn't ask at the time) when they recondition them.
