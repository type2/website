Subject: Sprinter James Cook 

Another manufacturer to bring van campers to the
US according to reports.  
&lt;snip&gt;
The Sprinter will be equipped for camping and
sold in a James Cook edition as early as 2003.

For those who aren't aware, Westfalia currently
converts Vito Marco Polo and, I think, Sprinter
James Cook for MB.  Here's a link:

Hopefully, the smaller Vito, and Westphalia Vito
Marco Polo follow as replacements for current
Dodge Carryasparetrannyvan minivan.  

Unlike VW's EV, FL and soon to be Dodge Sprinter
will have a diesel option in the states.  
Maybe I'll be able to replace my busses in the
future with a well built camper based on a fuel
efficient diesel van after all.
