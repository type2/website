Subject: Re: Fan housing/Engine progress

I listened to the voice of list reason and found a bus fan housing instead
of trying to adapt the 914 which I had.  Thanks for your replies.  It is
sometimes hard to see the forest for the trees.

For the record, a 914 fan housing is identical to a bus fan housing with the
exception of the that nefarious dipstick tube, and a couple of bolts which
are on top the bus fan housing.  I'm not sure what they're for, but they
appear to be there to mount something to the housing.  But all ductwork,
including connections to the heat exchangers, is exactly the same.

The new engine is just about ready to be installed.  I've got a few things
to clean up in the engine compartment and then... we'll see.  Tomorrow she
goes in, Sunday she starts.  And if all goes well, Wednesday sees me driving
out of this swamp.

Thanks again,

Jarrett
