Sign shop - they can cut for custom vinyl graphics for a price.

Spring for the fancy vinyl - it lasts longer.

&gt;All this talk about paint jobs.....
&gt;
&gt;I got a quote on my 78 Champagen edition this weekend and am thinking
&gt;seriously about doing it.  The quote is from a local guy who has painted
&gt;about half the cars that are in the local club.
&gt;
&gt;The only problem he has though, are the 3 stripes around the bottom of the
&gt;bus.  He says that finding some that are as wide(about 2&quot;) as what the
&gt;stock ones are is going to be difficult.
