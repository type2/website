Subject: The Wheels On The Bus Go Round and Thump

Greetings all listmembers....
I'm back.. after a while away.. been reading the list on the web... and
working on my 79 7 passenger bus....    Here's the deal...

Bought it about a year ago, have fixed many items... including new brakes,
pads, rotors, front disks...  new shocks... original equipment type... my
VW guru told me that the tires were causing the wheels to feel as though I
was riding over a speed bump at low speeds....   I just came back from
Sears with  4 new 185 R 14 C Load Yokohamas balanced and installed... and
was expecting a smooth ride...  No such luck...

I've narrowed the &quot;speed bump effect&quot; to the front drivers side wheel.  The
steering still feels tight, and the bus drives straight, even with both
hands off the steering wheel... but as soon as I apply the brakes, (which
are all new) I can feel the speed bump effect on that front wheel.  The
bumpity bump is noticable without the brakes applied, even when the bus is
rolling without the tranny engaged (4 speed.)  It is hardly noticeable at
high speeds (40 and over.) I suspect it is some kind of front end problem,
but without having a clue as to what it could be, I'm hesitant to bring it
to a regular alignment place.. fearing that they will take me for all I'm
worth.. which isn't much... hehehehe...    Any ideas?  Similar experiences?
  I checked the archives and couldn't find anything pertaining to this
particular problem...   Thanks in advance for your responses...
