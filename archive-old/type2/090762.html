&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Need to know which fuel pump to use for a (single) 
carb'd 2.0 - I'm assuming
&gt; &gt;you can't use the FI pump (correct?). What are those 
of you running carbs
&gt; &gt;using on 2.0s?
&gt; 
&gt; Assuming you do not have the hookup for the mechanical 
fuel pump, you can 
&gt; use just about any electric pump that is designed for 
carbs and 12V.  I 
&gt; have one of the Facet pumps which are by far the most 
common and very 
&gt; inexpensive.  Buy two in case the first one dies.  :)  
You can probably use 
&gt; it without a regulator, but you should check the 
pressure and make sure 
&gt; it's not over about 3psi.  The Facet pump is rather 
noisy so you will have 
&gt; to live with that or come up with some kind of 
isolated mount.

CB performance (www.cbperformance_dot_com) sells a rotary 
electric fuel pump that they claim is much quieter than 
the little square ones and is internally regulated to 
3.5 psi. The price is $42.95, less than you'd pay for a 
pump and a quality pressure regulator. I bought one and 
plan to use it when I swap the engine from the &quot;old&quot; bus 
to the &quot;new&quot; one. The part # is 3193.
