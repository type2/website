Subject: oiltemp gauge

Hi all - in relation to my earlier post: my new oiltemp gauge has sender
for the idiot light (tee on oil pressure idiotlight sender). I recall mr.
Hoover stating that this was pretty inaccurate. Any suggestions for a
better spot? Also, how does one test these things? The gauge and sender, I
mean. I assume I can hook up a multimeter or something, but I'm cluless as
to what to read and where.
