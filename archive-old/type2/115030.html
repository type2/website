&gt; My '78 2.0L FI has the same hole. Makes a perfect spot to route the wire thru

Thanks for the tip Robb!  I will make a note for when I do that job.

I have a carbed engine and the hole isn't used for anything on mine either.
It's hard to be sure though as the engine has been in pieces for a couple of
months.  You would think there would at least be some sort of rubber plug in
there.
