Subject: Re: '69 doors need help!

Nick,

Hey, no offense intended, but... Are you closing the
slider properly??? Hey, I've had 3 busses and only
recently learned the &quot;proper&quot; way to close it ;-)

Instead of &quot;slamming&quot; the door, you slide it just hard
enough to engage the front latch, then pull the outer
handle up. This locks the back latch and prevents
unecessary stress-damage from &quot;slamming&quot; it shut.

If your handle will not pull &quot;up&quot; after the front
latch is engaged, try checking the little lock-switch
inside the door. It should be white and tear-drop
shaped. Make sure it's perfectly level (try lifting it
&quot;up&quot;) and try again. This should work.

As far as the rear latch not opening properly....LUBE,
LUBE, LUBE, BABY! Make sure that all
channels/mechanisms are free of loose crud/debris
first, then.... LUBE! I use wheel-bearing grease,
combined with a liberal dose of WD-40. 

I found the wheel-bearing grease alone was too thick,
causing it to stick on colder days. Likewise, the
WD-40 was too thin and didn't last long enough. You
might also try white-lithium grease, but I'm dubious
about it lasting very long. 

Also, visualy inspect the doors bearings while sliding
the door back and forth....make sure they are  all
(there are 4 of them)turning as they are supposed to.
If not, try freeing them with WD-40 (or other
penetrant) and see if this works. If not, replace
them; the door will not slide properly otherwise. If
you gotta replace, call a bearing-supply house...you'd
be surprised what they have and much cheaper/less
frustrating than trying to find the O.E.M. stuff, too
(you'll need the I.D., O.D. and width specs before
calling, so dig out the old micrometer;-).


Good luck!
