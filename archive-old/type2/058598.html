    Well, my recall of &quot;pedal to the metal&quot; might not have been
full-time, but nevertheless, 65-68 was top speed, which is what we ran
it at full-time on the highway, and running a vehicle as fast as it will
go all the time certainly is not good for it, IMHO. 
    Are you saying that you could actually go much faster, but are
holding back to half throttle to run at 62? What then would your top
speed be on the flats, with no wind? Is there a significant gearing
difference between '68 and '71?? Because mine was a brand-spanking new,
VW dealer maintained machine and didn't go any faster -- ever, on the
flats -- than 68mph. Even small hills or headwinds brought it down
sharply. 
    Just simply not enough power, as far as I'm concerned, when you have
to be constantly maxing it out. Especially when you load it down for a
long trip. My wife and I and two kids, a dog, cat, 17' Grumman square
stern canoe, and mucho gear lived in that bus for an entire three
months, went coast to coast and back, and it was just too hard on it.
