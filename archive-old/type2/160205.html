Subject: Massively rich or ...?

A friend just bought an '82 Vanagon.  Took it in to get emissions test.  It
pegged the meter on HC in both low and high RPM, and failed CO at idle.  I
am not sure where the adjustment screw is on the AFM, am currently searching
the archives for that, and am not sure what could cause such a massive rich
condition?  Ideas and hints?
