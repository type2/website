Subject: Re: [T2] Your opinion please.....

Ted,

Gene Berg sez...isolate the intake manifolds as much as possible...that
means to me, the bakelite gaskets.

I am currently running metal ones on a bug with no problem, but have read
the berg tech articles that &quot;say&quot;  isolate as much as possible...

Your mileage may vary&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I have a 1600 DP in a '71 Westy. Engine is basically stock with Kadrons and

&gt; 1)bakelite gaskets, 2)metal gaskets, and 3) fiber gaskets. Checked the
&gt; archives and got mixed reviews. Which one is best at preventing leaks? Which
&gt; one would be best for this application? As always, TIA.TBear
