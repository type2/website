Subject: Re: [T2] replacing Solex 30 PICT with 34 PICT

&gt; Hello all-
&gt;
&gt; I am new to the list here.  I have a question that I haven't been able to
&gt; find a clear answer to.
&gt;
&gt; I suspect that the Solex 30 PICT-3 carb on my single port 1600 needs to be
&gt; rebuilt.  I have a spare rebuilt 34 PICT-3 but I don't know if the two are
&gt; interchangable without any significant modifications.  Can anyone clear
&gt; this up for me?  Thanks in advance.

different bolt pattern.  You either need a adapter or to modify your
manifold.

Personally, I'd go with a new 31PICT-3 carb over trying to adapt the 34.
Yes, it's more money, but it's a bolt-on and the carb works great.  Mine
ran great right out of the box (bought from Ronnie) and still does two
years later.
