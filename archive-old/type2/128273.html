Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Just found out something really cool about my
  bus...

&gt; When I had a '71 Westy I was able to fit several sheets in diagonally.

hell on the interior though. its just almost impossible to get it in and
out without scratching or scuffing the cabinet or bed.


&gt;
&gt;  Full sheets of plywood fit nicely through the rear hatch.
