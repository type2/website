Subject: many threads come together

I personally can't stand the Dead (no flaming, now!), but having loooong
hair and driving a Bus tends to make folks have some assumptions about you!
One cop hassle (tried to tell me my reg was expired tho it had been renewed
the month before), but most cops I've encountered  have been friendly -
maybe my Dept of Public Safety Officers' Booster sticker?
 On a related note, when I blew plug#3 out after coming down from Mt
Navajo, the cop held the flashlight while I checked the threads! No
problems; just remember, when traveling on a washboard road, *stop* every
so often and TIGHTEN things - plug #3, most of the engine tin, and 8 lug
nuts came undone on the trip up the mountain...Yikes! It also turns out
that I went up 10,000 ft with only three cylinders w/o even noticing!
 One last sticker note. I  currently have a Negativland *CAR BOMB* sticker
in the back window of the loaf... now THAT seems to offend people. I had
new tires put on  late last june. If THAT rings a bell for anyone. Mechanic
came up and said &quot;I bet you think yer *REEEEL* f'ing funny.&quot; I drove around
the block and rechecked the torque on all my lugnuts, brake lines etc. Some
people take things too seriously  I guess.
