Subject: wiring problem

I have a 1974 westy.  The vehicle has a VDO tach, VDO oil pressure gauge, 
VDO voltmeter, radio, air conditioner switch (AC is non -operable). 
  Anyway, during daytime driving, no lights, etc., the volt meter stays at 
about 13.5 to 14.  Never have had a problem with the battery not charging. 
 But at night, with the lights on, and brakes, and turn signals, I'm steady 
losing ground on the volt meter 12, 11, 10 etc.  I never drive more than 10 
-20 minutes at night, so no problem.  While I was driving last night, I 
started messing with a wire under the dash and all the sudden the lights 
got real bright, the horn worked, the dash lights were brilliant, even the 
alt. light had that nice glow, but the needle on the volt meter was up past 
16, as far as it would go on the gauge.    If I dig in and fix whatever 
short I found while messing around with that wire, will that much extra 
juice fry something?  Thank you.  Joel Lambert, Atmore, Alabama
