well it is world war two time in high school so that means old movies and
lots of them.  so far we have watched &quot;Assisi underground&quot; &quot;the scarlet and
the black&quot; and one movie on mother teresa which didn't involve world war
two.  well anyway these are catholic films becaus ei attend a catholic high
school(regrettably). but the first two movie had some nice kubelwagens and
some old bugs.  the mother teresa movie showed her in south america ridining
in a beautiful bay window double cab. and teachers do ontn appreciate it
when you yell out in class that mother teresa is a volks folks. also some
old world war two films show the assembly line and old split bugs rolling
out. just thought i would metion my sightings. everyone have anice weekend.
