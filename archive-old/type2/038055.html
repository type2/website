Subject: How one thing just leads to another...

Hi all,

I decided to get my ' 72 bus ready for the summer camping season this
weekend and went to work installing my recently purchased Pertronix and a
new engine seal. The idea was to do these two small jobs and then find and
fix the source of an oil leak I have. I started with the ignition and it
looked like an easy job except for the fact that I needed to do some extra
removals to get at the screws (on the distributor) for the condenser and the
one holding the points wire bracket in. So I was forced to pull the stock
oil bath air cleaner and attachments to the dual carbs. (we're talking 1700
dual carb stock setup here). 

Once I got all that off, I started looking around in there and noticed how
good my access was to the other stuff in there so I decided make the best of
it and take the opportunity to inspect/change my fuel lines as needed. Keep
in mind that this is a ' 72 without the over engine hatch that you other
guys have to make things easy... ;-)

While this was going on I started thinking (Bad Sign) about that gas smell I
was getting last year during turns and stuff, so I decided I had to pull the
fuel tank access panel off (with the engine still installed) and check it
out. This was a tricky pain in the backside job but do-able (as previously
noted on the list). To make this happen, off came the aux. blower for the
heater and my BN 4 setup on the LH side of the engine bay. I won´t mention
all the wires and lines that also needed removing.... Well, since that was
now out I was able to inspect that area and noticed some small rust spots
that needed some treatment. After that was taken care of I was able to go
back to the gas tank job.

Once I got the back panel off I found the the source of the gas smell: A 90
degree rubber connection from the gas tank to the vent line was cracked and
allowing gas to slosh out. Not a good thing. I noted old gas stains on the
side of the tank from previous &quot;sloshings&quot;. This seems to me to be as
serious as a fuel line failure as the location is also near the exhaust. So
if you have the smell, do what you need to do to fix it.

So where am I now? Well, I'm temporarily screwed until I can find a
replacement for the fuel fitting because (of course) VW doesn't carry it
anymore.... Part No: 211 201 157 A in case you are interested/have an extra.
Maybe I can rig something.... I got eberspacher, heater fan and various
fittings and hoses strewn around the garage (I'll probably never get those
darn vacuum lines back on right). The back panel is out and it'll most
likely be hell getting in back in. With luck I'll have it all back together
by the beginning of June. But I guess I can look on the bright side: The
engine seal replacement is now a piece of cake. Oh yeah, my back is killing
me and I never made it to fixing the oil leak...

Anyway sorry for rambling on, I just had to get this off my chest.
