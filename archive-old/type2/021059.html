First off, thanks to Jerry and all who replied.  Also, thanks to Isaiah 
for replying.  Thats a very cool name ;-)  (I just had to say *something*)
Anyways...

I run a single port engine in my 71.  Any 68-70 tin will work for this, 
but if you were to run a doghouse setup, you would need the 71 only tin, 
or take a beetle piece of doghouse tin, and an early bay piece of single 
port tin and blend them into one.  The top piece of the early bay tin is 
only spot welded on I think.  Its actually 2 pieces of tin welded 
together.  So take the top piece off of the single port early bay tin, 
and spot weld, or tack weld it to the doghouse beetle tin, and voila! 
You have doghouse early bay tin.

Ahh, the wonders of a 71 bus.  Ya gotta love those disc brakes!  I know 
I do!

&gt; Went thru this a couple of weeks ago - seems the 71s used a differently
&gt; shaped tin for that year only. Still available, someone on the list probably
&gt; has one.
