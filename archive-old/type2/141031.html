Subject: Re: [T2] VPC Air Conditioner for Station Wagon

Yes, I have a stock 1969 Kombi, 1600 single port, and yes, drum brakes. My
only consolation is that the ZVW 203 270 is the &quot;correct&quot; period accessory
option for my model, or so I was told. Can you confirm this, Dave? You're
the one who worked for VPC. Although, what good will it do if me to have an
antiquated set up but for a museum and shows? Given this scenario, will
installing a York compressor have any additional load on my engine even if
the aircon is not turned on?

But since I'm planning to use my Kombi as a daily driver after I've fully
restored it into stock, I really am considering the rotary compressor for
practical reasons. So please, keep your inputs coming. And maybe someone out
there who has had experience with air conditioning a bus with a type-1
engine, share their knowledge.

&gt; looking?...or do you really care?  &lt;grin&gt;
