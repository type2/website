&gt; &gt; I had my engine rebuilt in July because it threw a rod (3 days after
&gt; I bought
&gt; &gt; my doublecab, that's another story, but it makes me wonder about
&gt; &gt; coincidences).
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; How many
&gt; folks out
&gt; &gt; there smell their dipsticks?
&gt; 
&gt; He's full of it!  Sure, a small amount of gas can get into the
&gt; crankcase via a float valve leak, particularly if the vehicle was left
&gt; in a nose-up position.  It's happened to our bug.  _HOWEVER_ it only
&gt; happened when the bug was left on an uphill incline with a near-full
&gt; fuel tank and it sat for more than a month!  The crankcase pretty much
&gt; filled with oil in this time and promptly blew out the front seal with
&gt; no damage to bearings.
&gt; 
&gt; Normally, a small amount of gas gets into the oil via blowby, and it
&gt; is evaporated by the heat of the oil and then burned via the crankcase
&gt; breather tube.  If you drive the bus regularly then there is no way
&gt; for the gasoline to build up to a level that reduces the lubricating
&gt; properties of the oil appreciably.  If you did screw up the oil, the
&gt; likely result would be a siezed or spun main bearing, not a broken rod.
George and David:
Two ways more that seem more likely to me are:
1. Choke stuck on.
2. Failed fuel pump diaphragm.
Having said that, however, I tend to agree with George. To affect lube
quality of the oil, you'd have to be thinned with 1.5-2 Quarts of
gasoline! If, however, your oil level is going UP instead of down, this
is something you should suspect. Oil dilution is a good reason to change
oil more often in winter- the choke's on more and the oil isn't as hot.
Even at 125-150F, though, gasoline evaporates rather quickly.
I'd rate the odds of this causing bearing failure at about 10-15%
likelihood.
