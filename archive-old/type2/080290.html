Subject: GL4, GL5, Synthetics, Porsche


I recall something about GL4 and GL5, one of the 
differences is a certain detergent/dope. I think 
it was GL5 that had a much higher sulphur content. 
This would eat away certain bronze bearings, 
bushings, and maybe synchro rings. That is why it 
is important to use only GL4 where the manufacturer 
recommends it. 

The question to explain why Porsche used synthetics 
in their aircooled cars if it supposedly is bad for 
them. Pretty good one! ..  I could've thought of 
that myself, or shoulda :) ..  anyways, the Porsches 
do have about 1500 liters per second going through 
the fan, as opposed to our 5 or 600 Lps at around 4000RPM 
or so. (approximate figures off the top of my head). 
Further more, they have about 10-11 liters of oil in their 
dry sump systems and have a -big- oil cooler, or at least 
the 911s which came from the factory with synthetics. 

I have an early 90s factory Porsche tech bulletin somewhere 
which states that the 356/912 should not use synthetics 
because it is incompatible with the gasket materials used 
in those engines. 

I use Valvoline SynPower 5W50. It meets the API SJ/CF. 
After reading up a little bit on the subject here I am 
kinda dissapointed, I thought I'd have a somewhat 
superior oil here. It cost me about $5 a liter in Holland, 
I'm about to find our what it costs over here. I expect 
less. I don't know how often I change it, but less than 
5000 Km. I changed it about ten times during the first 
10K-Km. I use this oil all year round. It starts up fine 
(911 starter helps too), and has the Berg relief valve 
built into the oil pump cover. The first few fills were 
Shell Helix Ultra 5W40, but this oil still gave me the 
occasional oil light flicker after highway driving, though 
I have to note I was still breaking it in and it may have run 
a little hotter because of it, and the OP switch comes on 
between 11 and 15 PSI. Still I wanted the oillight to stay 
out all the time, and going to the thicker 5W50 did it.
