I don't think you are getting screwed per-say...I lived in Phoenix for six
months and was surprised at how cheap gas was in the &quot;winter&quot; months. I
guess they lower the price for all the snowbirds in the RV's....don't the
snowbirds realize how much money they could save if they drove a Westy? ;-)

Thank You,

Should have mentioned that I'm in Lake Havasu, AZ. Last week in California I
was paying $1.79 to $1.98 for regular. Sounds like we are really getting
screwed on the west coast (right coast) or is it left?
