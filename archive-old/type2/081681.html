Subject: Re: [T2] bus stereos / how much power??

Aaah another topic I can answer. A lot of people run no stereo so they can
listen to the engine..a good point. However if you want some good sound here
is what I did and it sounds darn good to me.

First thing is a nice stereo. I run a really nice Sony Xplode deck now (as a
rule the speakers should cost more than the deck for good sound). I put 6&quot;
Pioneer full range speakers with seperate nice tweeters in the front doors.
To keep the vibration, etc down I put in new wooden door panels too:

In the z-bed I have a Jensen 300 watt amp which runs 2 big Pioneer truck
boxes, my bass for the most part. (admitidly I need to figure a way to
expose the speakers. It sounds good anyway, but if I were to cut holes in
the z-bed they would sound a lot crisper. I lean towards not cutting it up).

The niftiest thing I did was add some nice Sony Xplod 6&quot; speakers in the
back deck lid. The amp pushes these too. I replaced the thin birch trim with
1/2&quot; plywood, using the birch as a template. They were tricky and there are
things to keep in mind like clearing the back cushion. The speakers were so
heavy that I had to install a catch (a Westy table leg) for the back lid.

All together the stereo sounds pretty good, front or back and your friends
can get a thrill from sitting in the back seat!! So far I haven't ruined my
original Westy material.

I also recomend a stronger alternator (yes its available) and running off
the auxilery battery. I run my stereo all the time off my single battery and
have never drained the battery (unless I just leave the key on, and the bus
is not running). You may have something set up wrong?

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; so I have been trying, and trying, and trying to come up with a stereo
&gt; configuration that doesn't sound like shite and have not had much luck.
