Subject: Re: [T2] Buying Clutch Overhaul Parts Ahead of Time?

&gt; &gt; certain which type of parts will be needed. TO bearing and, I guess, 
&gt; &gt; some of the other parts, too. Is there some way to determine the the

&gt; &gt; handy number stamped on the side or something, maybe?
&gt; 
&gt; if the clutch is questionable, or making noise. and you have the extra
&gt; $100 to spend. just get the clutch kit. comes w/ clutch TO bearing,
&gt; and pressure plate. someone can correct me, but as long as it's a 1600
&gt; 12v engine the flywheel should be the same spacing on the clutch
&gt; bolts.

the problem is the TO bearing changed.

I pulled the engine on my '71 to find that I had a pre-71 TO bearing (and 
bellhousing, I guess, although not necessarily tranny).

short answer: i don't think there's any way to tell what year your tranny 
is based on the numbers stamped on it, and, if there were, it's 
always possible that you have a bellhousing from a different year on that 
tranny anyway.  

So I think you might be SOL, but I'm sure I'll be corrected if anyone 
knows better.  :)
