Subject: [T2] Runs a while then quits (Fri)

I believe the coil is inside the distributor, as well as the ignition
module. This is classic high mileage Honda problem, and he's lucky he got
that far; IME usually you get this problem at about 225,000 K. Usually it's
the ignition module that goes, and should be replaceable, sometimes it's the
coil. A lot of guys will replace both coil and module at the same time,
because one is usually not far behind the other. If I remember right these
cars use a blink code to show if there's a problem in the computer
system/sensors, the CPU box  (might) be under the dash, on the firewall of
the passenger seat, under the carpet. You put a jumper on the test harness
and watch the blinking led to see if the CPU has found a problem. The number
of blinks tells you where the problem is. Important to check this first
before replacing any parts. Time for a manual.

At best he'll be looking at replacing the coil and module; quite a bit
cheaper than a new dizzy. There are TDC and other sensors in the dizzy that
can screw up the computer, but then a blink code will tell you. These
sensors are not replaceable, you have to get a new dizzy.

Hope that helps.

Nathaniel

&gt; Since it's Friday.... my buddy's son Michael has an early 90s Honda with
&gt; around 
&gt; 300,000 miles on the odo.  Runs OK then quits.... and Michael has not found
&gt; the 
&gt; cause.  
&gt; 
&gt; a) Anyone know why a distributor for early 90s Honda would cost 300-400 bucks?
&gt; Is it somehow integrated with the ignition coil, or the computer system??
&gt; 
&gt; b) We all know there are any number of ways a 300,000 mile car can fail.  The
&gt; distributor was the guess of one tech.  Anyone on this list with aging-Honda
&gt; experience?
