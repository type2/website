Listees,

Here I am. reading about the bitches and praising of the Bus Depot and 
decided since I have recent experience, I should add my comments.  I think 
people who have a less than perfect experience are the most prone to speak 
up.   Those who have had reasonable to excellent experiences tend to sit back 
quietly.

My recent order was received this past Monday.  It was received in the as 
advertised 7-10 working days.  Out of ten different items, one item was back 
ordered and another will likely be returned as defective.  I was a little 
disappointed about the item that will be returned, but it's not a big deal.  
I have used mail order for a long time and this is par to good.  I think Ron 
does a good job of selecting the best parts for our busses.  I would rather 
pay a little more for the better parts than buy cheap sh*t and have to 
replace it later.  I do not know of another supplier that does this.  Ron 
seems somewhat to be a victim of his own success.  Give him some slack.  If 
you have a problem, tell him and give him a chance to correct it before 
complaining to the world.  I'd hate to see him driven out of a business that 
we really need because of an unfair evaluation.   You can do yourself a favor 
by not waiting until the last minute when you really need that brake cylinder 
or whatever to make it to the weekend campout or show.  Things can and do go 
wrong even with the best intentions.  Murphy is not a stranger to VWs.

Have a great bus weekend!
