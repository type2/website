Just a thought. Is your thermo time switch working right? It's supposed to
run for a max of about 8 seconds on cold startup, activating the cold
start injector. Then the bi-metallic strip warms and cuts the current,
killing the injector. I'm not sure how it would fail, but that injector
starting up all the sudden would probably overfuel and kill your engine.

Anyone else have any ideas?

Please, what ever you do, don't carb it! ;)
