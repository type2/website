&gt; It wasn't bad, until I got to the bleeding part. Am I doing something 
&gt; wrong? I've got a Mity Power Bleeder attached, go to RR, bleed it  first,
comes
&gt; out nice &amp; bubble free, as I would expect, not having  messed with the
rears.
&gt; LR, same deal. RF, got a lot of air out, but  eventually bubble-free. Same
on
&gt; LF. Get in, pump brakes, all the way to  floor!!! No pressure! For cryin'
&gt; out loud, how difficult can this be??
&gt;  
&gt;   Hep me, pleeez!
&gt;
   FWIW, I had the same prtoblem and bled the brakes a few times in that
sequence with
the same results (even with a bench-bled master cylinder). What worked for me
was
the sequence left front, right front, left rear, right rear...I know, I
know...opposite of
what it &quot;should&quot; be...;-(
   Give it a shot, it's only another pint or so of brake fluid...
