Ken Hooper sed:

&gt;Put the negative cable back on the battery, about ready to cruise around
&gt;the block and make one last check for the smell of gasoline--and the hot
&gt;wire to the alternator immediately LIT. I don't mean the insulation melted,
&gt;I mean the wire is vaporized. By the time I got the ground strap back off
&gt;the battery there was nothing left of the wire but the ends, and clouds of
&gt;smoke.

Ken,

You may have a different problem, but when a similar thing happened to me,
it was caused by an internal short in the alternator: I was driving along
when the car went dead and the charge light came on. I stopped and checked
in the engine compartment to see the main power lead to(from?) the
alternator had done the same thing as yours. After towing the car home and
removing the brush holder from  the alternator and looking inside it, I
found a small piece of brush that had broken off at some time in the past
and had been lurking there ever since. A bump in the road or something must
have moved it to where it could short the armature to the alternator body.
The alternator was cooked after that.

It is possible that in pulling/refitting the engine you dislodged
seomething that caused a similar short. If that is the explanation, then
your alt is prolly cooked as well, so I hope it was something more obvious
and less damaging. Anyway, hope this helps solve your prob.
