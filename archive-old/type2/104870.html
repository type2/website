Alan,

All of the details in your post above add up.

Measure the new pushrod and make sure it is the same length. If the length
is the same, you should be fine.

That said, IMO you would be better off with a good used stock pushrod than a
mismatched aftermarket one, but this is a bit of a nit-pick.

No-one has asked why the old pushrod failed, but that would be more
important to me at the moment than the fix.
