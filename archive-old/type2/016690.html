&gt; Hi Volks
&gt; Got a simple one thats making me feel stupid. When I rescued my 70 westy it
&gt; came complete with the infamous front spare carrier but no spare. When I tried
&gt; to mount a spare it became obvious that the stud pattern was right (wide 5)
&gt; but no way would the studs reach the wheel! Is there another piece that makes
&gt; this work or am I just a fry short of a happy meal ; )
&gt; Chuck
Did you try turning it over?  They generally only fit when the _inside_
is out, then the studs reach.

HTH.  :&lt;)
