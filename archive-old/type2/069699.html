Subject: Engine Dismantling, stripped screw?

        I trust this is a stripped screw HEAD, otherwise removal
wouldn't be a problem :)

        Soak the offending screw in Liquid Wrench or other penetrating
oil starting now...

        I've successfully Easy-Out'ed more screws than I care to
remember, but not all were successful. I recently broke down and
bought a set of left handed drill bits from Griot's Garrage, and
the one I've used so far worked great! Griot's sells 'em in sets
with the matching easy-out for about $30.

        The Eastwood Company sells just leftie drills. Page 77 in the
&quot;Summer Fun&quot; catalog they just sent me. 1-800-345-1178 $12.99 for the
set of 1/8, 3/16/ 1/4 inch sizes, Basicly 3, 4.5 &amp; 6mm for the inch-challenged.
Item # 1519.

        (Actually, I'm 'inch oversupplied :) )

        An Easy Out is a very coarse (like 2-5 turn/inch) left handed
screw, hardened very hard, with a nice square tail on it. You drill a
hole in the snapped-off or stripped-head stud/bolt/screw, POUND the
Easy-Out in with a hammer, then clamp on a tap handle or vice grips
and turn in the 'remove' direction. Since the Easy-Out's 'threads' are
left handed, turning left (anti-clockwise) TIGHTENS it's grip on what you're
trying to remove while loosening it from whatever it used to be screwed into.

        Of course, what you don't want is to break the Easy Out, since
they're 10 times harder than any drill :( so you want to try to drill the
biggest hole you can AND use the biggest Easy Out you can get to fit,
to minimize the chance of breakage.

        A normal, right handed, drill will be tightening the offending
object while you drill, the leftie-loosie drill might even back-out the
offending object while you drill.

        This is a good time to remind people to put a little tiny dab of 
antiseize on steel screw threads that go into the case or head and hold
tinware on...dissimiar metal corrosion can basicly weld the steel screw
into the aluminim. That happened to the alternator bracket bolt on my
Rabbit- 8mm, snapped off, never could get the remains out of the hole
in an 'ear' cast into the head... finally drilled it out and tapped it for
1/4-20 inch bolt &amp; reassembled. I inspected and replaced that bolt
regularly aftet that...
