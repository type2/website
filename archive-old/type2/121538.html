Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [BSKA] Update on the BBB burned bus

&gt;I will add to this check the d*mn thing for a charge too.  had put an
&gt;engine in that had sat for a while and a mouse had built a nest in the
&gt;heat duct of the engine.  well a little oil and muffler heat ignited this
&gt;mess.  new gas lines but it was smokey.
&gt;   grabbed the ext from behind my seat, pulled pin,  nothing, nada, zip.
&gt;
&gt;ooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ssssshhhhhh*ttttttttt
&gt;my bus was saved by a nearby person who used thier own ext on my fire,
&gt;wouldn't take dime for replacing it either......I also keep a 2 liter
&gt;bottle of water nearby, won't work on the gas but will help knock down any
&gt;leftover smouldering materiels, also will cool things down so they don't
&gt;reignite

Saw a fellow stopped on the Autostrada near Rome back in 1993. His nice 
little Fiat 500 was on fire. I was passing by in my Beetle and swerved over 
and stopped handing him my fire extinguisher that I always kept in the car. 
I stayed long enough to see that the fire was out and he was calmed down 
and then left. He tried to pay me and take me home for dinner (the usual 
response - and quite valuable to a single guy living on a diet high in 
Ramine Noodles) but I hoped by in the Beetle and headed back to Naples with 
a BIG grin on my face. Felt good to help him out even if it did cost me a 
$12 extinguisher.
