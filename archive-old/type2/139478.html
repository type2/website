Subject: FW: [T2] Starting problem - Update

OK  Small update - if you can call it that..... Bought a new battery (Group
size 41). It cranks a heck of a lot faster, but still wont turn over all the
way.
On to checking the starter I guess..

&gt;  I turned the key to see what happens today, it turned over very
&gt; slowly, then
&gt;  stopped turning altogether. I turned the ignition off, waited a
&gt; minute, then
&gt;  tried again. This time I got maybe half a turn, then nothing.
