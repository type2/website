well,

I believe that the 40 horse actually started in the 60 model year with the
&quot;bastard&quot; 40. That was an engine that had a poorly designed crankshaft
that usually broke after 30k miles... wierd heads, thrust on #2 instead 
of # 1 main, all kind of odd stuff.

Technically the 60 model year started around august of 59, but if they
have a 59 model year bus (splitcase transaxle) then it would have been a
36 er... the 40 started with the tunnel case tranny in 60. (a one year
only tunnel case tranny i've been told... strange 1/2 gear that is quite
weak.)

As always i could be wrong, but we have a guy in our club that has 2 or 3
early 60 busses and he is all into the early 40 horse engines. Dave
easterwood is into this stuff too, im sure he has an exact answer.

take care,

Steve
