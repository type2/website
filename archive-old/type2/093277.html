Subject: Re: [T2] sticky steering wheel

It is simply flexible paint for vinyl and plastic. The stuff is the exact 
stuff you need to recolor either vinyl or plastic and not some JC Whitney 
miracle in a can or some other miracle hype. The professional guys/gals use 
it. All the local FLAPS carry about 3-4 colors but none seem to be the same 
quality as the stuff I used. The brand name is SEM.

Our local auto body supply store carries about 2 dozen colors in stock and 
can get any color you want.

$6-$7 a can. Easy prep, easy spray, dries VERY fast.

Even survives my grandfather's death grip on his steering wheel which I 
recently resprayed. He had rubbed the OEM color off. He does this to every 
car - presses so hard that all the switches have no markings - windows, 
turnsignal levers, etc. I've begun wondering if it isn't my grandmother's 
lotions too.

I have recolored the dash and plastic trim inside my bus as I am moving 
away from the Champagne Edition brown everything (Cow Poop Edition) to 
something different. The good thing is that I can recolor it again when 
Champagne Edition Westfalias reach $25K for stock condition... The paint is 
very thin, durable, and does not hide the texture of the vinyl or plastic.



&gt; &gt;Clean the wheel with mineral spirits very well, quick wipe of lacquer
&gt; &gt;thinner to clean away the mineral spirits, and then a coat of vinyl dye
&gt; &gt;will cure your sticky wheel.
&gt;
&gt;I can get the mineral spirits and laquer thinner at Home Depot.  Where can 
&gt;I get the vinyl dye? What exactly is it?
