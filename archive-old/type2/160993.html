Subject: Re: [T2] upgrading brake system

I have done this, not because I wanted to.  Long story.

You will not get better braking, you will get a longer period of time between changing the pads, and it will be easier to find replacement calipers,rotors, pads.   The caliper piston count and diameter is the same, so the caliper will apply the same force to the rotors, and the stopping power is the same.  The calipers are deeper, and the '73-'79 use a  significantly thicker pad that will laser longer.

If you look in the archives, I listed all that was done to make this switch.  It was pretty extensive.  Trying to remember, you need to replace the steering knuckles, dust shields, calipers, rotors.  The spindels are the same, I am pretty sure.  Brake booster is also the same.
