It starts totally mellow with the Burger Meet.
Starting at 5:00 pm we meet at the University Burgermaster
3042 NE 45th Street, Seattle. A show and shine for all VWs.
If you have a really cool old one, park near the front!
To get there from I-5, exit onto 45th Street and go east towards the
University of Washington. Go past the University, then down a steep
hill. The Burgermaster is on the left past the University Village
shopping mall. For more information go to kenm_at_thebusco_dot_com There is
also talk of a rally that would finnish at the burger meet. Check back
for more information.
