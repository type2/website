Subject: tips for installing fuel sender on 69 single cab

hello all.

my fuel sender i ordered from BD just arrived yesterday.
thanks Ron for a good price on a hard to find item &amp; good
service on my order.

while i did find an article in the type2_dot_com library that 
covers installing a sender in a 74 &amp; up bus, i need advice/tip
on installing one in my 69 Single Cab.

the firewall is already removed, so i have fairly easy
access to the tank. the tank was cleaned/treated by the
PO, so i would rather not remove it unless absolutely
necessary.

of course i know i need to disconnect the battery, but
are there any other safety precautions that i need to take?

also, on the sender it says &quot;warning: remove pin before
installing&quot; or something like that. i didn't see a &quot;pin&quot;
on it anywhere, but there is this little funky looking
thing  secured with a bolt on the bottom of it.

is this thing going to go off like a grenade when i take the pin out?
just kidding.

thanks in advance for any advice/tips!
