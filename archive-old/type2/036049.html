As for putting the engine up on a workbench, or whatever, I'm not sure 
why you're doing that either. Don, an Oceanside listee, sent me plans for 
a nice engine stand made of 3&quot; casters and 4&quot;X4&quot; Douglas fir. I emulate 
the sturdy Japanese craftsman and sit on the floor. It takes zero effort 
to move the engine through 360 degrees. I'm thinking of getting a tatami 
mat just for engine work.
