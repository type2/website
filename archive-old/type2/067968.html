How's the supply of the limited edition Johnny Lightning Busses in your 
neck of the woods?  (Limited to 4800, avaiable at Venture stores)

There are 14 on the shelf here and I might be *persuaded* to pick up one 
for someone.  These are all black/red.

Usually I don't buy toys in this price range ($15), but my wife gave me 
the go-ahead.  Yay!
