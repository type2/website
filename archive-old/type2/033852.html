you wrote:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The pushrod for the alternator style fuel pump is longer than 
&gt;&gt;the generator style. That may be why your fuel pump is damaged.&lt;&lt;

&gt;Er?...Am i missin sumpin ere?  Why would a fuel pump be different for an
&gt;alternator than a generator.  Would the Mexican case be cast differently
&gt;for the alternator requiring a different length fuel pump pushrod??   

THe problem is that the alternator has a much larger diameter
than the generator. So, it impacts the regular fuel pump.
So, VW tilted the fuel pump and changed the pushrod length.

VW should have left the fuel pump the same and just changed the
phenolic block that sits under the pump. After all, they were
already changing the length of the rod and it is easier
to make sure you have the right riser and pushrod (items
that are only ever changed when the engine is built) than
having two different pumps, which are replaced much more
frequently.

OK, A list question: Who has GOOD pumps? Most of what I see is
in the $15 range, and that is a cheapo 'Hecho in Mexico' pump.
