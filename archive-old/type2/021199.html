Subject: Re: [T2] Shifting problems 


Add pilot bearing to the list.  When I first got my bus it was always
hard to shift into first and when downshifting into 2nd.  Pilot bearing
ended up going south (lots of squealing when clutching, and when I was
on vacation far far far from home), and after putting in a new one
shifting is just peachy.
