Subject: tires/speedo

Hey, guys.  I went over a hill the other day to find several cops standing around one of those radar signs that show you your speed.  It said 28.  I noticed that the speedo was pretty close to that.  So I speeded up until the radar said 30 and held it there.  It was dead center of the line at 30 MPH on the speedo.  Moral of the story, if you run stock tires 185/R14, the speedo is accurate.  I'm running Hancook RA-08's on the front and Bridgestone RD-603's on the back.  Couldn't be happier.  I was probably the only guy those cops saw all day speed UP when I saw them .  :) Cheers...KR
