The COSTCO version of this garage/shelter is the same price.  It's overall
construction is of a higher quality, and it comes with sides at no
additional cost.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  KMART sells a 20 ft by 10 foot frame with awning top that purports to be
an outdoor garage for $149.  I helped set one up at  Westies in the
Woods, not difficult, looks strong, tall enough, has steel tubes,
connectors, bungee style clips, and feet that can be pinned to the
ground or screwed to a substrate.  You could add tarp sides or ends
based on how you orient it to the sun.  &lt;&lt;
