Subject: Head Count!  BBTA next week!

With an impending trip to St. Louis next weekend, I was curious 
how many list members are planning to attend BBTA this fall?  I 
will be going in my '59 single cab.  If anyone is passing through 
Atlanta on their way or is somewhere between Atlanta and St. Louis 
and wants to caravan, let me know.

Next week will be busy for me because I will be swapping another 
tranny into the single cab before the trip.  The early '59 split-
case tranny is not great for highway driving (plus mine leaks).  
I will be putting in one from my '62 deluxe with 46k original 
miles (it has been parked since 1970).  I also have new Boge 
shocks to install.

I look forward to seeing everyone there (especially Sami, who came 
to my rescue during &quot;the ride from hell&quot; from Kansas a few days 
before last Christmas).

Dave
