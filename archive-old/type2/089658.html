Subject: Re: [T2] horn button removal

&lt;&lt; is this true in a 71 as well? of all the things that actually work on
this bus after it has been parked for almost 20 years, the horn,
unfortunately, does not. haven't gotten around to chasing down the wires
for it yet, but when i do, i will be removing the horn button as part of
the process.
 &gt;&gt;

Looking at the horn button, then at the silver ring underneath it.
Don't try to pry the silver ring up; slip a blunt knife or whatever
between the ring and the button. Slide the knife around the per-
imeter of the button to loosen it, then gently pry it up. Too much
pressure might chip it instead of releasing it.
