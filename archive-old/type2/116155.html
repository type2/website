Subject: clutch cable again II

Old cable came out and was totally broken (all strands) right where it would exit the bowden tube. 

There were NO adjusting washers on my bowden tube at all. I assume this lack of tension is my problem with cables as I'm always adjusting down to the end of the threaded rod and sawing cables in two.

I remember that picture in the bentley showing the proper deflection dimension.

Was there an actual spec for that deflection?
No need to look it up, I have the bentley at home,
I'm just curious.

Billy
