Jon, 
Thanks for the reply.
I am almost positive that my test port is threaded.  It has been a little while (last Fall), but I've had it out before and I remember it being a very small threaded plug. I am 99% positive!
I am meaning the plug on the driver's side fuel rail a short distance from the firewall.  I am assuming that this is the test port?  Is there another place to test the pressure?  Did some have threaded plugs and others not?
What holds the non threaded plug in the rail against the fuel pressure?
Thanks again,
Greg


Greg,

I just bought an actron from Checker yesterday. It works fine with the
universal adapter. You just have to block off one end of the tee fitting.

Your Westy doesn't have a screw-in pressure fitting (but it looks like it),
only a plug. There is just a regular press-on nipple like at both sides of
the rail. You use a regular piece of FI hose to the pressure tester.

The Actron unit registered exactly what the Bently describes, 35psi so it is
an adequate unit for the occasional test, IMO.

Jon
