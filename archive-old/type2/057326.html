Subject: Jerome Jamboree VIII Caravan (North/Central Cal)

Well, it's seems I've given myself the task of doing some sort of caravan
from Northern and Central California to the Jerome Jamboree this year.
Last year, it was Rex Eastman, Bradley and myself, but this year I've had a
number of people wanting to tag along, so I figured I'd better get this
posted to the Lists now in case any others wanna come along.

I live in Redding at the northern part of California and will be departing
at 8am on Thursday, September 10th.  My route will take me south on I-5 to
Sacramento, then to Stockton, where I will take CA-4 (Crosstown Freeway) to
go south on CA-99 to Bakersfield.  This route will take me through Manteca,
Modesto, Turlock, Merced, Madera, Fresno and Tulare.

One meeting place already in place is the Flying J Auto/Truck Stop at the
Merced Ave exit just north of Bakersfield.  This is where Rex Eastman and
Marc Edwards have indicated they will join up with me.  Final departure
time from this stop is 3PM and will travel over the mountains on CA-58 east
to Barstow, then on I-40 east to Needles, Kingman and then into Flagstaff.
Between Kingman and Flagstaff, we'll pull over for the night for some
shut-eye at an exit I can't remember the name (or number) right off, but
it's well off the highway and in a large enough space to accomodate several
vehicles without our disturbing anyone or being disturbed ourselves (at
least we weren't last time we were there).

South from Flagstaff, we'll either go I-17 or AZ-89 (89A?) down into
Cottonwood and then into Jerome.  Camping is allowed the Friday before the
actual event takes place.

IF YOU WANT TO CARAVAN
Please Pmail to jim_at_oldvolkshome_dot_com with the subject: NORCAL CARAVAN.
Please indicate where you wanna hook-up with me or the group throughout the
route I've listed above and at what particular time.  Send your phone
number too.  Dependable, well-kept/maintained VW's are preferred of course,
but then we'll be heading through a lot of desert and mountain passes, so
be prepared for any situation.  CB Radios would be be nice - Rex may have a
couple of extra radios with lighter plugs for power.  Official Caravan CB
Channel is 2, although I may be monitoring on and off the truck channels as
well (Ch 17 on 5 &amp; 99, Ch 19 on 58 &amp; 40)

I haven't been in a position to read the List(s) mail lately, so the
following Jerome Info may have already been posted (my apologies).  This is
taken from the flyer I received recently in the mail.

JEROME JAMBOREE VIII

Put on by the Arizona Bus Club, held at the Gold King Mine, Jerome,
Arizona, Saturday &amp; Sunday, September 12-13th

Caravan out of Phoenix leaves at 7AM Saturday morning - recommended that
drivers be there at the Home Depot parking lot on I-17 and Thunderbird Road
by 6AM, this sounds like a monster caravan this year.

RAFFLE
Grand Prize - 1966 Custom Walk Thru Camper
(Plug - I've donated most of the rubber and weatherstrip for this camper -
End Plug)
2nd Prize - 1600 Longblock
Other Prizes - Safari Windows, Roof Rack, Heads, CB Radio and a whole
buncha other stuff too.

CHARITY AUCTION
This is a staple of past Jerome Jamborees - Proceeds to go to the Arizona
Children's Burn Camp.  In addition all fees paid by attendees over and
above actual event costs go to this and other charity organizations that
the ABC helps to support from their other events.

CAMPING
Due to the HUGE attendance last year, space is getting REAL TIGHT (which is
why I like going in Friday afternoon).  The owner of the mine can only cut
so far into the mountain (as he has done in years past) to make more room.
So, spaces will be marked off in advance to get as many people in as
possible (no &quot;circling the wagens&quot;).  Only Volkswagens will be allowed in
the camping area - non VW vehicles will have to park elsewhere.  This is
partially for photo purposes, but then again this IS a VW event.  Leave
your SUV at home, please (Tri-Stars &amp; Syncros are welcome of course!)

PARTS VENDORS
The past few years have not been exactly &quot;Vendor Friendly&quot;, due to fears of
&quot;over-commercializing&quot; the event.  However, this year they will be having a
&quot;Vendor Row&quot;.  This is for people like Rex and myself selling NEW items and
the cost is $25.00 per space (doesn't say how big or small, but I'm sure it
will be flexible).

There will be the usual number of used parts swappers from other camping
attendees as well.

COSTS:
Camping per vehicle is $10.00 for Saturday night.  If you can show you
belong to any VW club (bring an addressed newletter as an example), the
cost is reduced to $5.00 per vehicle.  Reminder, for those camping on
Friday night there is an additional $10 (or $5) charge.
