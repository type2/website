I must agree with Thom, all other hearsay aside, the first guy to paper my
hand with the cash gets the ride.
I do say that up front when dealing with folks, nothing worse than trying to
sell a car, agree on a price, then you don't hear from him again.  In the
mean time you've told three or four callers it's already sold.
First come first served is the best policy with used cars.
