Subject: Free bus in MA (trade for work on 1600cc)

Hello List,

I met this gentleman through craigslist. He is trying to get his '71 buggy
running. He is willing to trade a '78
bus with a  good 1700cc motor for some work on his 1600cc buggy.

Please respond to
John Healey johnhealey1776_at_hotmail_dot_com

not me, I'm just passing the info on.

Looks like a good opportunity to get a complete parts bus.

Hes in Middleborough, MA

Eddie

========================================

Thanks for all the helpful information! Its a bit more than i expected.... I
have a question for you. Would you be interested in a 78 bus with a 1700cc
fuel infected bus thats got a bit of rot, but tons of good parts: the engine
worked awesome 2 years ago until the starter went and i decided my buggy was
worth my time more:  for a set of carbs and a day of troubleshooting on my
71 to get the 1600 cc engine thats in there working?it turns by hand, but i
cant get it going.  just a thought. ive spent time troubleshooting, but with
engines i am just not any good. If your not interested, thats fine... thank
you so much for all the info.

[...] would you have a working 1600 that i could
bolt in? for cash or trade...

 Im located in middleborough, and two towns over in plympton there is
a guy named mike banner. He is highly eccentric, but really cool and has
tons and tons of parts. I could put you in touch with him if you like.


its actually not a camper. its a 78 or 9, but i think 78 with a probably
non-original 1700cc ( i think they came with a 2 liter that year mostly).
the engine is strong as hell, last time i drove it i took it to maine. While
there, i lost both the starter and interest in it. Its sat for a couple
years, which it has from time to time in its life, but im sure the engine is
good. it still turns by hand. The body is starting to go, but its still got
good parts, and maybe even some life to it. It belonged to a good friend of
mine who passed away. he was the guy i always asked tech questions to when i
couldnt figure things out. SInce he passed, i havent had someone to help me,
so ive lost interest in my vw's. the 78 has got to go, so if you want to
just trade some time for it, you could have it. THanks so much for all the
info though! If your not interested, Im going to try and find just a running
1600 and buy that mount. then id be all set! i can fix anything on a vw as
long as it doesnt involve engines. i cant wrap my mind around em for some
reason. THanks for your time!

John
