&gt; I've seen so many buses with caved-in rear bumpers that I decided to do

&gt; enough, one day a friend who was following me a little too close,
&gt; slammed into me at 30 mph at a stop sign, and only made a couple of
&gt; small dents in the stock bumper, which was protected by the real (and
&gt; very ugly) steel bumper that was underneath that. (which weighs an
&gt; additional 50 lbs)

The hazard is that, if you make the bumper too strong, it will damage the
bumper mounts on the bus chassis.  I'm currently fixing my rear bumper
after an encounter with a pole.  The bumper got dented, but the bus is OK.

I can bang out bumper dents easily, but I don't want to untweak the
chassis!
