Sounds like a winner!   Yeee Hawwwwwww!    

It's great to see what can happen.    Poor Ken, after working under merciless
conditions to host the type2 list,  as a thank you gets inflicted with a 30
year old mechanically a bit more than marginal bus with a high cheese factor,
So cool.

Observations:

--The thing scats. Chip says it was built pretty carefully and dynamically
balanced and all that, you'd think from looking at it that it was a mother
(chrome 009, chrome power pulley, neener neener neener), but the proof is
on the highway and my it do go. Runs cool. Nice.

--Tracks like it's on rails. I still don't know why VW abandoned the link
pin suspension. This is the second splitty I've driven with a fresh front
end and 4000 lbs just cannot handle like this but they do. Although after
400 miles all this firmness takes it out of my skinny redneck butt.

--It sure is loud and the deplorable Monza exhaust don't help. That thing
has to go.

--JOSH: I am convinced this is an American conversion. The sink says
Campmobile but it doesn't match the rest of the bus. It's a converted
panel, crank-out windows w/separate individual gutters. Westyish coat
cabinet with a mirror on the door. Woodwork is not Baltic birch, appears to
be 1/8&quot; ash ply. Cab interior is painted white but aft is grey primer where
paint is exposed. Z-bed. Conversion upholstery is in a ghastly embossed red
vinyl, you have to see it to believe it. Overall the cheese factor is
around 8.5, it is not low. 8) Attached step does not fit into the jack

--Photos coming, more later.
