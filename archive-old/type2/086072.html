Subject: RE: [VB] NEW engine cases

Here is answers to all the questions I've been asked about the cases.

1. NO they are not full flowed

2. Yes they do have the mounting holes for late buses

3. They are TYPE 1 1600 AS41 style cases

4. It appeared that they were already clearanced for small strokers, not
confirmed.

5. Auto Linia (the manufacturer) also makes CB 044 head castings, EMPI's and
other various companies heads.

6. Aluminum alloy cases

7. If I remember correctly they are universal with the type 3 oil fill.

8. They will be in my possession on Wednesday, for those that want to call
and have me talk through the complete description.

9. The deal is THIS WEEK only at this price including shipping (lower 48)

Thanks to all that have shown interest, I have upped my order

Subject: [VB] NEW engine cases


  My supplier just got in a supply of NEW ALUMINUM engine cases, These are
made by Auto Linia in Brazil.
  For those of you that were at VW Drag Days and/or Pomona you saw these
there. I will do a list special and offer these for $300.00 dollars and
include SHIPPING in the lower 49 states. This will be THIS WEEK only if they
last that long. I have not built an engine using these yet, but am going to
build a stroker this week (as soon as I'm done with the one I'm building
now). The test engine built using this case has performed flawlessly.
  The materials used in this case as supposedly the same as a type 4 case
and should last forever. I will post pics this week


ronnie   just passing it on.
