Subject: A/T, knowing what you need

&gt;We are looking for a GOOD tranny to replace our old one.  We need an
&gt;automatic 74, 75 or 76 please if you can help we would much appreciate
&gt;it.   Thanks, Willow And Frankie.

It would help to know where you are and it would help to know what you need.
74 and 75 have a different tranny than 76. I presume it matters.
Here where I am at (AL) I would buy a tranny in unknown condition from a junkyard ($50 - $150), get a rebuild kit ($90 - $130) and have it rebuilt buy the local VW tranny guru ($150 - $250).
