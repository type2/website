Subject: Brake Warning Light Wierdness Fixed!

  Thanks to all who replyed with thoughtful suggestions on how to stop my
brake warning light from flashing.
As most suggested it was a bad ground. Not in the tail light assembly but
the welded on fixed ground tabs for the
tail light. I removed the gas heater duct for access and brass brushed the
contacts clean.
Previously i had pulled the bulbs and cleaned them and their sockets then
noticed while testing with the lens removed that the bulbs filaments were
glowing. After the contact cleaning all is well.
   When i went to fix the carb icing prob i touched the auto chock wire and
it fell off.
This wire from the coil also powers a plunger on the right hand carb. Is
this a fuel cut-off?
Seems to run fine after the minor repairs.

Thanks Again Listees!!
