The 72 1700 came with 137.5 main jets. The last carbed 74 1800 engine had 130s
and heating problems.  Running these carbs (and jets) on the 2.0L is a good
thing.  The increase in air flow due to the displacement increase tends to
enrichen the mixture for the given jet size.  Look at VW's history.  As
displacement increased, jet size was reduced in the same size venturies.
For smog purposes, a leaner mixture means less unburned hydrocarbons, and a
lower CO level.  Along with an increase in engine operating heat.
