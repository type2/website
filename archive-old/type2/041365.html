Subject: newbie again

Listers,
	Thanks to all who replied to my weak tranny problem. Especially to Kirk
Decker, who suggested double-clutching. I drove home without gear grinding
last night for the first time in weeks. I wonder why I didn't think of
it...I guess that's why we need a list like this.
	Thanks to the list, I've also nixed the idea of using ATF, and will
search for the appropriate GL-4 trans oil. Once again, I appreciate all the
sage (w/parsley, rosemary &amp; thyme) advice.
