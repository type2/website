hmmmmmmmmmmm.....the firsat thoughts that come to mind are lack of intense
maintenance..(like when you first owned it)....and its getting old....when
have you rebuilt the carbs??  changed the gear lube??  repacked the front
wheel bearings??  adjust all cables and linkages??  checked all vacuum lines
??  ....most people say &quot; ya i keep up on it and change the oil
regularly...but honestly how many keep up on all the maintence required to
keep your bus running SMOOOTHHHH??  everyone i m sure could use to take a day
or two and go from stem to stern and give your pride and joy a good &quot; going
over&quot;...........fwiw, thats my humble opinion
