Per the seller's request, here's the whole thread (not too long, and very
useful).

Sounds like we made it some discussion group. You are about the 5th person
in a week that wants to do the same thing with our product.

Our product Delta T Industrial Coating will work to relect most radiant heat
gain back to the atmoshere. However, our product requires a heavy duty
industrial sprayer for application. If you are familar with airless spray
systems, a gas powered sprayer can be rented at large rental centers for
around $100 per day.

The minimum amount of product that we sell is 5 gallons. I would recommend
two 20 mil applications for your bus. You should have enough product to coat
the floor and rooftop with 5 gallons. You willsee about a 5 db loss with
this application.

Total cost of the product would be $235.00 with about $30.00 shipping for
UPS ground. With $100 rental charge you will have around $350 installed
price. It will take approx 1-2 days with decent weather.

I hope this answers your question and if you wouldn't mind, please pass it
to your friends discussion board.

    If you have more questions, ask him.  I'd like to hear from someone
who's used it.
