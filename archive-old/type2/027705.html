In Phoenix yesterday I saw a 1980 Weekender Vanagon bought by Affordable 
German on Broadway St (local salvage yard, www.affordablegerman_dot_com). I was 
to receive the engine for a decent price. However when they attempted to 
start the engine it did (after some tinkering). It was assumed that a 
knocking sound was a bad rod, however after some severe reving of the engine 
the tappet filled with oil and stopped making the knocking sound. The 
salvage yard owner told me that he was not gonna part it out (bummer, but 
good too). He would have sold it to me for $1000 on the spot. I delined 
knowing that if my wife saw another VW in the carport I would be in divorce 
court ;-).

So here it is:
1980 (California version vanagon) Weekender.
Unknown miles, I think speedo said 60,000 miles, but cannot remember.
interior fair shape, needs GOOD cleaning and some upholstery work.
Body had some bondo work on rear and had some spots of rust here and there, 
one spot under the front windshield might need new steel welded in.
Engine dirty but running, exhaust leak on drivers side and loose head on 
right (this was to be fixed by Affordable German). Had AC but was missing 
compressor.

My impressions, the body needs alot of work (TLC hours) to make it look 
&quot;great&quot; (less if you can get by with &quot;good&quot;). Needs some work in the engine 
compartment (i.e. new engine tin seal, replace fuel lines). Tranny unknown 
(it drives)? Interior was intact (non-westy fridge, sink, cabinet) and had a 
fold-down full width rear seat. No pop-top. Needs new tires, and some AFM 
adjustment.

So for (he was gonna stick it out front for $1500) $1000-1200 (offer him, I 
bet he takes it) plus putting $1000 into it to make it reliable and look 
good, you could have a decent non-westy camper.

This is a steal for $1000-1200, it runs just needs someone to love it!
