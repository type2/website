Subject: RE: [T2] Type 2 in France and Switzerland

&lt;Would work well in this town too. Prob is how to stay warm in the winter and
what the cold does to the batteries. &gt;

The heat can be solved with several alternative electric heaters, but they cut
into your range. The cold issue is a problem if you get below freezing for a
long time. From my reading, I think the cold is not an issue in VA, except for
the decrease range. I do 40 mile round trip with hills and 4 red lights. All
highway driving. Talking to the guys at electro automotive a rabbit designed
to do 80 miles flat will cover me on my trip since it is all highway.

But in the end, I don't have the money to build one or buy one.

I am with you, I have 183,000 on my Blazer and 125,000 on my small truck. Not
sure if the truck will make it to 200,000, but the Blazer will. The bus will
be with me until one of us passes on to another world.....

$2.49 here, went that high last Friday.
