Hey Sean....

I would be quite skeptical of the need for a new engine.  Did you see where
the oil was dripping from?  Was it from the front (front is front) of the
engine or from a different place in the engine?  It could be as simple as
the front main seal (a $5 part)...

And fyi, $2400 is a helluva lot of money for a new engine and install.

I'll wait to hear from some of the other late bus owners (I've got a 71 with
a different engine, that has much cheaper parts) to see about that estimate,
but it sounds pretty steep.

Give us some more info, but don't run out and buy that new engine yet.

Well fifty miles into the 143 mile dirve the little red oil can lit up.  I
pulled over immedatly and than watched all the oil drip out of the
engine..  I just got the
call that I need a new motor.  The whole shabang is gonna cost us $2400
with a 12mo/12K mile warrenty.
