Subject: free 1970 tranny

List, 

Anyone in need of a '70 type 2 tranny? If you come get it you can have it! 
I don't know the working condition of it. I got it in a lot of stuff I bought 
a few years ago and need to get stuff out of my garage. The guy said it ran 
fine and I know the bus it came out of had about 88k miles on it when it, 
along with the motor and all else was pulled. 
I'm in Southern Maryland, about 25 miles south of DC. (Waldorf- Zip 20601)
BTW, I also have some glass from the same bus, you want it let me know, but 
you have to take all the glass I have. (Mostly side panels and vents. No 
jalousies or windshield)
