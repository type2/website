Subject: Re: sandblaster recommendation

Hey Bryant,  do not get a cup feed model, the capacity is way too small.
Make sure you get a tank type.

Also, be sure to get a water separator for the out line on your compressor,
otherwise your compressor will fill the sandblast tank with water and cuase
your media to stick.

And last but not least, don't use regular sand unless you use a breathing
filter, otherwise you could contribute to a disease called silicosis, very
nasty, similar to abestosis as the concept is the same, small fibers, or
particulates embedding themselves into your respiratory system.

Kindest Regards,

Mark

Subject: sandblaster recommendation

Does anyone have a sandblaster recommendation?
My brother and I are looking to get something that we can blast frames,
floors, nooks and crannies with. Something we can use a variety of media
with.
