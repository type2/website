Subject: road swaying

Hi all, 

I am new to the list and have enjoyed listening to the posts.  Now I need 
some help for the experts.  I have a '72 bus and I am wondering what to do 
about the swaying that happens at high speeds, such as over 55 MPH?  The bus 
runs great and has new 8 ply 185R14 tires on it with a recent alignment.  It 
just seems that when I am on the freeway, the bus feels like it is moving all 
over the road.  Is this normal?  I went to a mechanic whom has a good 
reputation and he did a bunch of work and said that I still needed the new 
tires and four ball joint boots for the front end four ball joint boots, drag 
link and steering box.  When I got the new tires, they didn't say anything 
about this and we all know that going to a service center for one thing 
always leads to others.  

Thanks for the advice,
Rob Garretson
