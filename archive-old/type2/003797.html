expense I dont need to spend. So, I have to get rid of a whole bunch of
Westfalia parts. I am offering these on a first come - first serve basis and
I am taking offers on the parts. If you see somethig you may be interested
in, please pmail me and we can talk. If the following parts arent sold
within 30 days, I will be forced to throw them out or let them sit outside.
Please, those who need them, come and get them...
