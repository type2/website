Joe Fournier sez:

&gt; Come on, guys! Waving has way more to do with the culture in which you're
&gt; traveling than with the type of vehicle you drive.

Yep, I agree with that.  And it can depend on what you wear too!  Back in
school, when I used to drive back and forth between Carlsbad NM and Socorro,
NM, (in a Ford Torino, sorry) I would occasionally wear a Stetson &quot;cowboy&quot;
hat while I was driving.  When I did, an entirely new group of people would
wave at me, usually other people in cowboy hats, often driving pick-em-up
trucks.  (some of them had baseball caps on, but these invariably said either
&quot;John Deere&quot; or &quot;CAT: Diesel power&quot; on 'em.)

Now if I was to wear that hat (now long gone) in San Francisco, there might
well be fewer cowboy-hat-wavers there.

Hmm, I'll hafta' put some peace signs 'n stuff on my '66 and drive around
rural Texas wearing a cowboy hat to see what sort of reaction I get. :-)

Saint Pon forgive me for the huge lack of VW content in this post!
