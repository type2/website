Hi Volks,

The Tromper (tromper_at_connectexpress_dot_com) wrote to the List:
&gt; Here's a curiosity..  Everyone talks about how gutless the upright motor
&gt; is.  I will make no claims to huge power, but mine with a Brazillian 009,
&gt; and an otherwise stock 71 setup does 70 in the flats pretty handily, does
&gt; lose speed up hills if my rpms are wrong, and gets me about 22 mpg + or -
&gt; my mood. My mileage gets better if I keep it under 60.  I will admit to
&gt; having an unknown year later (pancake) transmission.  Is all of this due to
&gt; the 009, the tranny or what????

My '72 stock (Euro) panel van with stock 1600 DP upright easily
reaches its rev limiter at 4,500 rpm in top gear at three-quarters
throttle.  At full throttle it even reaches it on an ever-so-slight
incline.  Rev limiter in top gear matches an indicated 120 kph
on both the stock speedo and the aftermarket trip recorder.

Normally I go 90-100 kph at half throttle or less, and will hold
that speed on most hills with more throttle.

I use between 8 and 11 litres of regular gas to 100 kilometres.
Average I'd say 9.

Conversions (I hope they're correct, 1 gallon = 3.74 litres, 
1 mile = 1.6 kilometres):
top speed _at_ 4,500 rpm: 75 mph.
travel speed: 56-62 mph.
mileage: 27.5-20 mpg, avg. 24.4 mpg.

So, they're not as mindboggingly sluggish as they're often 
said to be.  As always, YMMV.

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
