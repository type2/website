Subject: Re: [T2] Spare Tire Cover

From: &quot;Casting Fool&quot; &lt;jester_at_cfnson_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know of an inexpensive tire cover for the spare when it's on
the
&gt; front of the bus?  I tried Wally Mart, but they don't carry them.

We have spare tire covers.

210-85803/BK  Black  $15.45
210-85803/WH  White  $15.45
