&gt; Has anyone used a ceramic coated or powder coated exhaust system?  And does
&gt; anyone have any input on its advantages/disadvantages?  I've just rusted out
&gt; mine (lasted 4 years) and am looking for options.

i think it works. i have ceramic coating on my exhaust and heater boxes
(72-74 style). i went with the black finish, which is not as pretty as the
silver, and actually has developed some very very slight surface rust in a
few spots, but on the whole has held up beautifully in 2 seasons. someone in
my local club has the silver and it looks new after one season.

if you are spending the extra on ceramic, i would make sure you also have a
good quality muffler. the cheaper mufflers are very rust prone, due i think
to thin material and inferior steel alloy used in the construction of these
bargain units.

the muffler i have on my bus is a decent german (liestritz) unit, nice heavy
wall construction and quality welds. the ernst are even better of you can
find one.
