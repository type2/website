Joel, seems logical but it ain't
You want the air flow going in one direction only, that is coming in thru 
your vents and being forced over the engine. That way all the heat is 
directed down away from the engine. If you leave it open it allows the hot 
air to be recirculated thru your engine. Ever notice how there's positive 
pressure in your engine compartment?
