&gt; The fuel injectors for some reason do not like this gas.  After =
&gt; complaining to Chevy, they gave us a 5 year/100k extended warranty for =
&gt; our troubles.  We wanted them to replace the vehicle,  but we were told =
&gt; we would probably have the same hassles with the replacement.  Has =
&gt; anyone had this problem?
&gt; 
&gt; As for my 67 bus,  I've got to put it back together first. :)

My wife, Penny, just bought an almost new GMC Safari (same as an Astro
Van) at the suggestion of someone on this list.  So far (two weeks
now), no trouble with gas. What are your symptoms?  We too have the
100K warranty.

Penny bought the Safari because it is a lot like a breadloaf VW Bus:
   Back bench seats that fold down and can also be removed.
   Lots of space behind the back bench.
   Front seats are not cramped.
   Seats 8 or more in a pinch (we have 6 kids).
   A 4x8 sheet of plywood will fit in the back.
   Has a sliding door.
   It's big inside.

The new Eurovans cost a lot more than the Safari and only seat 7,
and they are just too small. What I really want is a NEW '71 VW bus!
