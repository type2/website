A quick perusal of the &quot;Old Car Price Guide&quot; has the most valuable Van of all
time as the 62 thru 67 splitty stationwagons...in best condition $20,500.
Interestingly, in later model vans '68 +  they put a slightly higher value on
the stationwagon models than on the campers.  John Jensen in Annapolis
