Hi Volks,

&gt; Hope i don't start a FART or off-topic thread but,
&gt; I wanna get one that says &quot;Caution: OIL LEAK WILL BLACKEN YOUR WINDSHIELD&quot;

ROTFL...

Reminds me... (and I did wait until Friday, so there):

When I bought my caravan trailer from a pal, it was quite
soiled with oil that his '77 deluxe had spit out.  Two
months later, he examined the trailer and said, &quot;well
your bus is spitting oil too a bit isn't it?&quot;  I humbly
pointed out to him that *my* bus' 1600 engine has its 
exhaust on the left, where the trailer was clean, and that 
the goo on the right side of the trailer indeed still was
out of *his* bus.

Still chuckling.  Sorry, I had to share.

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
