Hi All
	I've just put a set of heater boxes in my '73. The old ones where so rusted
out, not even my ultra frugal VW Guru thought they were patchable. The PO
RIPPED out everything from the front of the boxes to the cross member in front
of the dash-floor junction, so I've searched the Archive regarding duct work,
I'm leaning toward metal because the rear Y was sawzalled at it's widest point
and I'll need to make a metal cone then perhaps switch to PVC. I'm planning on
bypassing the floor vents even though it irks my sense of ... well you know.
	The problem I'm having is with the flapper cables. They appear to be intact,
but they are about 2 inches to short. I thought maybe I had the flapper boxes
in wrong. They do go at the top of the risers behind (fif) the bellows, don't
they? The ferrule on the end of the cable is about 3/4 in long, enough to fit
in the fastener. Has this been cut? Could the cable be kinked? This seems
unlikely as they move freely. Is there a way to adjust the length? Under the
dash? Should I plan on wiring them open and get a life?

Thanks, Rob   '73 Westy
