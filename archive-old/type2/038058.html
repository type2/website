Jeff.

So it pops out of gear when after shifting..


I remember when I alomost bought a 72/73 bus and it did the same thing on a test drive. I called a garage and asked aout it. They told me it was the SHIFTING FORK(s) and could be fixed with no problem. 

I have an automatic 73 bus and only remember what the guy said long ago when I almost bought that bus.

Peace
Andrew
