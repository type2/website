Subject: Re: [T2] Reply from promotors about last weekend's Bug-out in
	Manassas, VA

There was 1 split and the oldest bus was a '61 westy.  There were only about
5 busses there.  I was also surprised how small this event was.  However, It
did not seem to me that the venue could have supported that many more
vehicles.

&gt; I emailed after the show to tell them I had a good time, But was surprised at
&gt; the lack of vintage cars...1 oval window bug, no split windows...No 50's
&gt; busses, ets.....a lot of water-cooled, and great parts and swap meet, but
&gt; serious lack of vintage cars.  Here is their reply...........if someone could
&gt; forward this to the vintage bus and vintage vw list that would be great.
