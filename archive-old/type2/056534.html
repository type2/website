Subject: 77 camper for sale $300

Volks, I'm posting this for a net impaired friend.

Located in Newark Delaware.
Orange 77 camper, no motor, rusty outside, floors and front axle ok,
interior dirty but functional.  Asking $300

call Steve Z. at 302-454-8362

I've never seen this bus so I can't really comment on it's condition.
