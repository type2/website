Subject: Michelin tires

&gt; last time I needed tires I was told the MX was no longer avaliable, and
&gt; they wanted to sell me the MX4, ran and searched....finally found a dealer
&gt; who was willing to do a real search, and found the Michelin MXT truck
&gt; tire. (not light truck either)

Michelin have introduced an entirely new line of tires for light trucks.
These are called the Agilis series. On my '81 Vanagon I now have 4 of those
(195/75R14 on the VW Alloy rims). Big sturdy threads. They have a high load
rating and will take a very high tire pressure.

All the specs are on the Michelin website. Don't have the url ready (it's a
bit hard to find but keep looking).
