Jack,

Yes, this would be a concern if you hooked the power line of the cd
player to both the ignition line and the aux switch, it would only power
things on it's side of the ignition switch, but the effect is the same,
you would end up with an energized and possibly dead coil after this
event. The solution I would go for would be go get you a double pole,
double throw switch from Radio Shack or somewhere of the type, and hook
the radio's power line to the middle two connectors, the ignition line
to one end, and the aux battery line to the other. That way when the
switch is one direction the radio will only work with the ignition
switch, and in the other direction it would end up working all the time
off of your aux battery. And, as an added benefit to this, if you get a
switch with a middle position you can claim that the radio is broken to
those pesky people who insist on listening to radio stations not of your
liking.

Jonathan

 Thanks all, for the great ideas on how to power the 
gymnastic CD player.          
I think the solution for me is to put an extra interior  
light switch on the left of the dash next to the stock  
one, I'll wire this between the aux. battery and the 
ignition lead.

 HEY, WAIT A MINUET!.... won't this send power 
back thru the fuse block and power-up anything on
that circuit?
