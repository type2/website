Being a new guy here I hope I don't  start a fight too early, but your
question has brought up a major problem I have been wrestling with. I have a
'63 Sundial that I have taken down to bare steel, no rubber, glass,
interior, nothing. By this weekend I am going to put on some cheap color to
test what will probably be several test combinations before the final big
buck paintjob. What I do know is that it will not be one of the original
colors or combinations.

The thing, for me, is a work of art, I want the bus to reflect what I want
it to be. It will be lowered, but won't be a hot rod, will probably have a
wood interior and may have a mohogony dash, like on old boats.. The wheels
may be EMPI, but if I can trust lugbolt adapters I may use them so that I
have a choice of the wide array of wheel styles out in the market. The turn
signals may return to stock, but may not, I like some treatments I have seen
at recent hot rod shows.

My point is that while I have great respect for the bone stock resto, I have
niether the money or the patience to accquire all the original goodies to
return the vehicle to the showroom status, as well as I want this bus ( I
owned a '60 for 8 years in the early seventies) to be fun and different.

There was a scorching column in last month's Hot VW mag slamming anyone who
wanted to modify their bus in any way, and I've had my ear bent at several
VW events about keeping the bus &quot;pure&quot;. Aside from cutting out the rear
wheel metal (yuk) I plan to personalize it any way I desire. It was a rusty,
bondo covered piece of crud when I found it, so no one can say I've &quot;ruined&quot;
it.

And as far as it's resale value, I might reclaim some of the parts cost, but
I'll never get the money for the countless hours spent already. This thing
is an act of love and art, not even close to an investment.

So I say, paint it any way that will make you happy to own it, stock or
custom. It's still a split window VW bus, one of the coolest rides around.

&gt; Hi folks.
&gt;
&gt; Just bought a 67 deluxe 21-window in a lovely shade of
&gt; tar black with a nifty red beltline and nose.
&gt; I have 2 options:
&gt; 1) Get the vanity plate &quot;DARTHVW&quot;
&gt; or
&gt; 2) Paint it.
&gt;
&gt; Obviosly, option 2 is the desireable choice. Now comes
&gt; my question(s). The original paint was sea blue/white.
&gt;  My favorite old bus color is Sealing Wax Red/Beige
&gt; grey. They didin't offer this combo after 64 or 65. In
&gt; 67 the red was Titan Red with white.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have PICTURES of actual busses with Titan
&gt; red/white paint? The Wolfsburg West chart is tough to
&gt; go by. Also, was it a metallic red?
&gt;
&gt; Then, if I go the Sealing wax red/ Beige grey route,
&gt; would that make my bus less desireable? Since that's
&gt; not a stock color for 67 (either way, I'll do the
&gt; proper interior color for the exterior choice)
&gt;
&gt; So, is &quot;original color paint&quot; better then
&gt; &quot;non-original color from same year&quot; better then &quot;stock
&gt; bus color from earlier year&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Or, do most people really care, so long as it's not
&gt; tar black with a nifty red belt line.
&gt;
&gt; I will be sinking considerable $$ into a full
&gt; back-to-stock resto (except for engine/suspension to
&gt; be more safe&amp;reliable (see &quot;Jerome&quot;). And if I ever
&gt; sell it, it would be nice to know I could get
&gt; some/most of that back.
&gt; BUT...since I'm doing the 1600cc or better engine, is
&gt; the non-stock color going to be a moot point (i.e. bus
&gt; OEM status already altered, done deal)
&gt;
&gt; Experiences and case studies appreciated.
