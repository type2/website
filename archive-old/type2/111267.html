&gt; Hi Volks- Can anyone suggest a way to keep my radio settings when I

&gt; town..... Ted (financial report coming- fund drive was a great success)

You can use a 9V battery to keep the radio alive, but you have to put a
series diode in the circuit so you can hook the little battery up to the
cables (alligator clips are good for this) without blowing it up.
