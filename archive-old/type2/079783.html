Subject: Re: [T2] Does the grim reaper drive a bus?

TJ, list:
I agree. I've waxed poetic about this before.  I think there is some
Darwinism going on here in that it is a safer type of person that BUYS a VW
type 2 in the first place.
This makes the occurrance rate for accidents much lower.  I'm not a slow
driver or a cautious driver by any means. But I try to be a smooth driver
and often take the bus to the limits just to learn where those limits are.
Once I managed to thread our 87 Vanagon through a narrow gap between two
suicidal deer at a high rate of speed (70-75 maybe). I DID slow down after
that.
I've taken some pretty tight corners, making the tires squeal, almost always
by myself.
I've driven in some pretty bad crosswinds, that might have been a lot worse
with the wrong tires.
But, all in all, I've had a pretty good record in type 2's. Had my first
COLLISION in 19 years (and probably 400,000 miles) of driving type 2's last
September in my 1st day out in the 80 westy.
Some unlicensed 18 year old in his uncle's Buick ran a light and hit my
front corner.
I drove away, put in a new headlite. Must polish up my metal bumping skills
soon on this.
The Buick got towed; 18-year-old went to JAIL!

&gt; Put your seatbelt on and pay attention to what you are doing.
