Well, I have made a deal on the Riviera camper I posted about the other day--'72; nice body...lots of unknowns...kindof a gamble, but *really straight*. Problem is, I have to go get it soon, like Friday...other problem, engine's out of the bus. I know if I tow with the pilot shaft hanging out the back, I'll probably cause it to shear off and I'll damage the tranny. I remember advice about securing this shaft, but I don't remember specifics and can't find them in the archives.

Other option, I guess is to remove the CVs and let the bus freewheel all the way back. Anyone have any experience or advice on doing this? I'm looking at about a 150-mile trip on Interstate, probably the day after a light rain. I'm already figuring if I take the CVs off that I'll wrap and tape everything as well as possible.

All input appreciated! Thanks! Joe
