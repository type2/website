Hi Volks....I have the A/C that was in my 79 westy boxed and ready to
ship to the first person who wants it ($150 plus shipping).  It's the
dealer installed unit that has the blower that is installed under the
dash.  It's all there (blower unit, compressor, condensor, coils, and
the owner's manual insert) sans the second pulley.
