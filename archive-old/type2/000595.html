On my visits to the USA I have made the following observations:

- Approx.  98 % percent of their cars are automatics. I don't think at
matters as far as the drivers license goes.
- taking a driving test seems to be a very simple procedure compared to the
very rigorous testing in Europe.
- The 'hand-brake' on an automatic is often a foot-pedal. That makes it a
bit awkward in hill-starts.

This explains why some of our American listees have problems driving their
manual buses.

BTW - I once went on a rafting trip in the Sierra  foothills near Sacramento
(Placerville actually). An old rickety bus took us to the set-out point.
There were some very steep roads and ravines. The driver was a substitute
who had never driven a manual and had nu clue as to what he was supposed to
do with the clutch! That was a hairy experience. I bet you the gearbox was
ready for an overhaul after that trip (if it was not already).
