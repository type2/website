I just pulled the top off my AW. Does yours have a skylight/vent? The hole cut
for mine seemed very crudely done...
Watch for rust on the roof towards the back of the bus. There had been (for
some reason) a piece of particle board left in there that had gathered water
and rusted about a 6&quot; long hole in the roof down by the drip rail just after
the hole on the driver's side.

I have thought about other tops - maybe recondition a dormobile top or
something.
At present my plans are to recondition the top as well as the roof of the bus,
put it back on (sealed very well) and rebuild all the paneling inside with
nice, strong stuff.

kep us posted.

I have a 1970 Adventure Van. Excellent rust free California van with only
44000 miles on it. However, I have mixed feelings about the high roof, due
to wind resistance, poor gas mileage, and the funky look.  I have been
thinking about removing the high top roof, filling in the screw holes around
the roof perimeter, and getting a custom tonneau cover made (got a price
today-$400) to cover up the hole. Has anyone on the list done this before?
Any question of structural integrity? The opening appears factory, with a
steel strip border, not just cut out roughly or anything. It's about 6&quot;
longer than a Westy opening.

I stripped out 90% of the interior and replaced it with Westy camper gear
due to its' very poor condition. The Adventurer stuff wasn't nearly as good
as Westy, in my opinion.

Any advice pro or con would be appreciated.
