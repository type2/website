&gt; &gt; mail order?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pricy but don't need much.  (I think my fuel line is rated at something
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like 5,000psi or so)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uhhhh.. bob, I don't think that's enough.. You really should have gone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the 6,000 psi hose...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hahah :) :)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How much did it cost?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; well they gave me a discount because I bought some roll ends,
&gt; &gt; &gt; if I recall it was about $2 a foot or so.  or about $20 to do all the
&gt; &gt; &gt; hoses
