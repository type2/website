Subject: Re: Fuel Pressure Gauge?

Harmon

Any fuel pressure gauge that is to be read in the cab would have to be 
remote as you do not want pressurized fuel inside the cab. I didn't see a need 
for constant FP readings in the cab but it is very helpful in troubleshooting 
engine problems.  I installed a cheap ($6 _at_ sears) mechanical water gauge on the 
engine. It is connected to the fuel pressure test outlet on the left fuel 
manifold and attached to the air manifold with a large tie wrap which eliminates 
vibration. with the gauge installed on the engine, I have checked the fuel 
pump and pressure, fuel pressure relief valve,  and injector leak down time. 
Works for me!

&gt; Awhile back I saw mention of someone installing a VDO fuel pressure
&gt; gauge -- I've looked all over in catalogs, magazines, etc. for a listing
&gt; of such, but don't see any. Does anyone know who sells them? Tried VDO's
&gt; website (http://www.vdo_dot_com) but that's pretty useless.
