Subject: RE: [T2] Leaking pushrod tube

DAvid,

&gt; Now I've been told that they all leak!

 I filled mine up with Oil in Adelaide (Australia) a tiny bit over the line.
I drove to Byron Bay (a V.long way) It was still there when I arrived. I am
stoked. 74 1800 pancake motor.
	I gave it Synthetic for summer and it still doesnt leak. You have to put
them together carefully with right gaskets, right torque and gasket tak
where necessary. Then they dont leak oil. Which is V. nice.
	Barry Wright
PS Dont listen to rumours.
