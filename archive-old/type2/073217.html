&gt;1970  Functionally same as 1969's.  Aesthetic changes were the rectangular
&gt;      side reflectors.
&gt;
&gt;1971  Dual port and disk brakes, so 1 yr only intake manifold with booster
&gt;      port (although '71-74 autostick beetles &amp; ghias may have used the same
&gt;      intake manifold).  More emisions equipment added.  Aesthetically, went
&gt;      to the uglier big flares on the wheel wells.  Also the small 5 lug
&gt;      wheels with the flatter hubcaps that don't use hubcap clips.

I'm pretty sure the rear wheels got the bigger flares in 70, not 71?
