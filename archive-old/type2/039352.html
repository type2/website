I think you have this backwards.  The typical deep-cycle/marine battery
that you find in Wal Mart and auto parts stores is NOT designed to be
discharged completely.  Doing so will shorten it's life just like it will a
starting battery.  They are supposed to tolerate &quot;deep discharging&quot; better
than a starting battery but I have not found that to be the case.

I ran an RV/Marine battery as an auxiliary battery for a couple of years in
my bus.  When it could no longer handle deep discharging well (about two
years, as mentioned by others on this list) I used it as my starting
battery for a couple more years, where it worked just fine.

RV/Marine batteries are really not much different than starting batteries.
The only differences are that they have slightly less capacity and are
slightly more resistant to deep discharging (because of thicker plates).
They can pretty much be used interchangeably.
