Subject: Re: [T2] Those insulation panels?

I did that in my 75, plus added a few more rivets, where possible. My 80
doesn't have the fiber boards, just the rag felt covered with plastic sheet
held in place with springy wire. Doubled the quantity of spring wires to be
sure every thing stays in place. This would help on the bay windowed buses
