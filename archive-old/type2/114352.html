Subject: FREE! 70 Westy Pop-Top in NH

Bussers,

I need room in my barn, so I'd like to give away my 1970 camper parts 
bus.  The catch is you must take the WHOLE bus, no picking off parts.  
Rusty body, missing windshield, slider door included but fell off.  Pop 
top in great shape, complete with good canvas.  Transmission in, worked 
when parked.  Engine out but included, ran when parked (about 5 years 
ago).  Bumpers and seat/bed but no front seats.  5 wheels and tires that 
roll.  P-mail for any further details.

Mark Ryan
