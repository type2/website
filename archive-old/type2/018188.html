       I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;shimiming&quot; it. Where most dizzy's
need help as they age is the bushing that keeps the upright shaft
centered. When it wears, the cam lobes then wobble, making it impossible
to keep exact dwell and timing. I'd think a new bushing would be in
order here, or a custom made one if you had the original specs, which
I'd think you could get from Bosch.
        The Pertronix setup helps a good bit to compensate for wear in
the bushing, up to a point.
