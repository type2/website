Jim:
I agree and that brings to mind something I should share with the list. While at a
Porsche swap meet recently, I met a guy, Rick Stecker, who sells German tools. He
sells the neatest spark plug sockets with built in torque wrench. Can't remember
if it was a Hazet or a Stahlwille. Nice stuff. His email is:
