&gt;For this reason, I'm thinking of moving the battery to underneath the
&gt;rear bench seat.  I guess the major concern about this is venting.
&gt;Would this be a major health concern.. it puts off hydrogen when
&gt;charging, right???

I believe it only puts out significant amounts if it is overcharged.  I 
have had two batteries inside the bus for years (inside battery boxes) with 
no problems, health or otherwise, but the only reason I did it was because 
they wouldn't fit in the 2nd battery tray.  I still don't consider a 
battery inside the bus to be an acceptable long-term solution unless the 
battery box is sealed and vented to the outside, or unless the battery 
itself is sealed.

Sealed batteries are great, but can be expensive.  Probably your best bet 
would be to pick up an Optima at Costco for $99.  Great price for a quality 
battery and you can safely keep it inside your bus.  You will still have to 
cut a hole in the body for the positive cable though (don't forget to use a 
grommet).

&gt;Or, I guess the other option I'm thinking of is to leave it on the side
&gt;and put a marine cover over the battery so the rain water doesn't drip
&gt;on the battery and also so battery acid can't get on the metal... but
&gt;still, I just HATE the location of the battery.  It's such a hassle to
&gt;get in and out and dealing with the cables, etc...
&gt;
&gt;Any thoughts on this?

Yeah, my thoughts are that it is much more hassle to deal with *inside* the 
bus.  Are you sure you really want to attempt this?
