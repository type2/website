 You youngsters may not remember the Charlie Ford saga of ten years ago. Charlie wanted to do something before
he left the magic age of 40 in January 1997, ten years ago or so.  The story starts in about August 1995 and
includes a full one year odyssey of the USA.

 His story and experiences show that VW Karma, and what VW Karma does.  There is, somewhere, a better
replication of Charlie's postings.  Perhaps the files were lost during the most recent server outage.

 On this ten year anniversary, perhaps someone could point us in the right direction.  And let us old timers
remember and send Charlie Ford our best wishes and thanks for some interesting stories (I went to that trailer
park in Nags Head North Carolina and stayed a few nites during a Christmas season, just to share a few moments
of what it would have been like to travel the USA alone.)

 To read these stories below, I suggest that you do a 'select all'  'copy' and 'paste' into a word processor
of sorts.
