Subject: Piston stuck in caliper

HELP!

I'm in the process of rebuilding my calipers.  I rebuilt the right one 
already, and now I have the skillset to rebuild the left one.  I have 
R&amp;Rd one piston (the outboard one) on the left caliper, but now I can't 
get the other piston out.  I hooked the caliper back up to the bus and 
pumped the pedal mightily, but the piston won't budge.  Do I need a new 
caliper?

The bus has been pulling to the right for months.  The pads on the left 
side are worn all the way down, but the pads on the right side still 
have a lot of miles on them.  I'm replacing them anyway.

Please p-mail me as I am in digest mode.

Chris

P.S.   This is my daily driver so I'm stranded in the meantime.
