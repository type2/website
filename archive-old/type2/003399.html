&gt; Hi list
&gt;      Wondering if anyone has come across this before.
&gt;      Recently I purchased a parts bus (rusted out underside) that had been
a
&gt; transporter passenger bus, converted to a homemade weekender. The original
&gt; rear seats had been out of the bus for apparently many years, as they are
in
&gt; very, very good condition and appear to have never been recovered.
&gt;      Howevere, this bus had been sitting still for the last 2 years. PO
had
&gt; put the rear seats inside the bus for storage during this time.  The
window
&gt; seals leaked water down onto the shag carpeting, creating a wonderful
musty,
&gt; wet carpet smell in an otherwise enclosed bus.
&gt;      So, now these VG condition seats stink like musty carpet. Of course
&gt; tried scrubbing them, etc.  Smell is still there.
&gt;      It would seem a crime to take apart seats that have factory covers on
&gt; them, that have no rips or tears anywhere.
&gt;      Is there anything besides hanging air fresheners in the bus that a
&gt; fellow could do to eliminate, or at least reduce, this awful &quot;Grandma's
&gt; basement&quot; smell?
&gt;
&gt;   TIA
