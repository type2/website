Subject: Rebuild bottom--or not

Jeff and the list,

I'll pass along my experiences with a decision to do a top end only rebuild.
Engine in question is a 1600dp with an unknown past.  What caused the
original engine pull from my new-to-me 1970 was gas leaking out of the neck
of the intake manifold.  Compression was 125-115-100-115.  With this
imbalance and my desire for a reliable motor, I did the heads, P&amp;C, new
carb, etc.  I checked the crank with the case intact, Muir method, it
passed.  So I replaced the rod bearings, copper color but not burnt or
gouged, carefully shaved the rods to balance, and remounted to the crank.
For a couple hundred miles it ran great but then came the ticking noise when
warm, and its getting louder.  I have a spare motor in the Turtle, this
partial rebuild hasn't been broken down yet.  What I expect to find is
looseness of a new wrist pin in the worn rod bushing.  I am going to do a
bottom end rebuild now or get an AVP shortblock.  The lesson I learned is
beware of the point where new parts meet old.  Good luck.
