Subject: Re: [T2] After you get the CV's and axles off:



&gt; After you get the axles and CV's off the bus, there is another tool 
you
&gt; might want to buy called an external snap ring plier that will help 
you
&gt; remove the snap ring on the end of the axle next to the CV in order to
&gt; replace a brocken axle boot and clean the CV.

Excellent idea.  I've removed the snap ring without this tool, but not 
voluntarily.  another trick that I use is to use a small file to put a 
concave surface on the inner aspect of the split of the snapring to 
allow the snap ring pliars to push on them without slipping.  I stick a 
phillips screwdriver in the hole in the end of the axle to prevent the 
snapring from flying away if it slips.

&gt; ***BEFORE you remove the CV, take some very thin wire, carefully 
remove all
&gt; the cap screws and washers keeping the CV straight on the axle, slid 
the
&gt; metal plate back that is on the rubber boot away from the CV and run a
&gt; couple pieces of wire through the inner most part of the CV (not the 
axle
&gt; hole as the axle is still in place) and then out through one of the 
cap
&gt; screw holes.  Put a couple pieces of wire 180 degrees apart from each 
other
&gt; and twist lock the wire tightly.***
&gt; 
&gt; This will keep the CV from twisting when you take it off the axle.  

I've found that the boot keeps the joints in line if you don't release 
the flange from the CV.  You have to turn the CV quite a ways to 
release the balls.  Putting a CV back together is not too difficult, 
but is probably not a puzzle one wants to attempt while trying to get a 
bus back on the road!

&gt; Clean the CV's completely in NON FLAMMABLE engine solvent (another 
cheap
&gt; insurance), let dry (better yet, blow dry with pressure, using 
safety), then
&gt; repack with CV grease only.  CV grease is the only type of grease 
that will
&gt; work in this application as it does not migrate like other greases 
and will
&gt; not get thin under the heat and pressures that are generated.  Force 
the
&gt; grease all the way throught the CV by hand.

I don't do a complete cleaning unless the boot has a big tear in it.  
If I catch the boot failure when it is just weeping grease, I just wipe 
the grease out of the CV with a lot of clean paper towels and repack.  
I feel that I introduce more grunge with a complete cleaning than would 
remain without cleaning.

The best way I've found of doing a complete cleaning is to wipe 
everything clean with paper towels and then wash them with dish soap 
and warm water.  Rinse with hot water and dry right away.  Coat with a 
thin layer of CV grease before reassembling.  Surgical cleanliness is 
important during reassembly.


&gt; It will not hurt to mix up CV's and axles as long as they are wire 
tyed.  It
&gt; WILL hurt if you drop the balls out of a CV and do not get them back 
into
&gt; their same grove as each ball will wear a bit differently.

I've never had a problem with this, but I usually don't take them 
apart.  The manuals say that you shouldn't mix balls from CV to CV, but 
it may not be good to even move a ball from one groove to another.  One 
can keep track of the proper indexing of the outer race, hub, and 
balls, but it can get tricky.

Best advice before starting one's CV adventure:  Wear surgical gloves, 
and have several extra pair available.  You'll find this to be a 
greasy, greasy, job!
