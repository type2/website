Would anyone in the SF bay area consider letting me park my '76 Westy at
their place for 12 days while I fly to Bulgaria? I fear leaving it in
the long term parking at the airport. It's a clean rig. Departing Nov
7th Return Nov 18.

On another note, does any of our British listees happen to know if hitch
hiking is legal in London? I have to get from Heathrow Airport to the
Gatwick Airport both ways, and I have 5 hours to do it in. And the dang
bus costs $30.

Reply P-Mail please
