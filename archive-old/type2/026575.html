Subject: RE:  reverse light mod..

&gt;Is there a way to inroduce a Reverse light indicator to the dash? Would
&gt;this just involve running a wire from dash light to the reverse light so
&gt;when it is engaged the light on the dash will go on? Reverse is a tricky 
&gt;one most will agree( i hope, or im a fool) and Im constantly in 2nd 
&gt;instead. Its a little embarassing lurching slowly forward until I find
reverse.
&gt;Sometimes, mostly, Ill find it by blind luck. But I thought If a light on
&gt;the dash would show me I am in reverse I would idiot proof my self from
&gt;myself. :)

Sure you could do it.  Just splice into the wire that runs through the
reverse light switch on the tranny and run a wire up to the front of the bus
to hook to a light.  

But reverse should not be difficult to find.  If you're really having
trouble with it, I think your shift linkage needs to be adjusted.  

When you push down on your shift lever, you should be able feel when the
ball on the bottom end of the lever clear the lockout plate.  If you don't
feel this, it is possible that the lockout plate (that's the plate that
holds the shift lever to the floor of the bus via two 13mm bolts) was
installed backwards - ask me how I know.  If that's the case, it makes
reverse VERY hard to do.  

If installed properly, the lockout plate should be installed with the
lockout slide to the RIGHT side.  If that doesn't sound right to you, make a
small circle with your forefinger (that represents the lockout plate) and
stick a pen through it (the pen is your shift lever).  Now move the pen to
the &quot;reverse&quot; position and watch the part of the pen that sticks through the
bottom of your finger.  That's why the lockout side of the plate goes to the
right.

You might also want to take a quick peek at your rear shift rod coupling
where the shift rod attaches to the selector rod on the tranny - they're
prone to wearing and breaking which makes shifting very vague if not
impossible.
