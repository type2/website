Subject: GL 4

Here are a couple of sites that talk about gear oil:

If you look at the 1st thing listed for GL 4, it says 'manual
transmissions'.
This tells me that this is the 1st choice for a tranmission.
If you look at the last thing listed for GL 5, it says 'may also be used in
manual transmissions'.
Hmmm, sounds like last resort.....

The second paragraph is very informative:
&quot;Gear oil is acidic, motor oil is alkaline. Gear oil needs very high wear
protection- Extreme Pressure
(marked as EP). Therefor, it has a very high sulfur and phospor content.
Sulpur and phosphate reactions
start at a lower temperature, and gear oil has much more additives than
motor oil. This additive is corrosive
to copper bearings and bronze synchro rings.&quot;
Scroll down, GL 5 is &quot; high sulfur content&quot;.

Is GL 5 a modern day replacement for GL 4??  I don't think so!
Read the back label of a bottle of GL 5. It says &quot;can be used in manual
transmissions IF the transmission
requires GL 5&quot;. VW transaxles require GL 4. Only the final drive of the auto
trans requires GL 5.
