Subject: Re: [T2] sub-cultures

I think it might be the area.  When I drive my Bus around (I'm 30
minutes -south- of Atlanta) I get strange looks, a couple waves, always
waves from other AC VW owners.  When I drove a Bus up in the Chicago area,
no one ever gave it a second look.  I also remember seeing more of them up
there, which is funny, due to the cold weather and rust.  Go figure.

&gt;I know that we're all a bunch of bus-nuts who eat, drink, and sleep these
&gt;things; but there seems to be a group of people out there who have never
&gt;seen a camper bus, nevermind ride in one.
&gt;
&gt;I just took five people to lunch in my bus, three of which are well old
&gt;enough to remember when air-cooled VWs reigned supreme. Based on the sheer
&gt;awe, and silly (to me) questions - you would think they were riding in a
&gt;space ship. It was as if I had created this thing in the garage, and it was
&gt;the only one of it's kind. The biggest suprise to them all was that I had a
&gt;closet in my van.
&gt;
&gt;They spent the entire ride (20 minutes each way) opening all the doors,
&gt;playing with the sink, and asking where the bathroom is.
&gt;
&gt;This is not the first time I've had this reaction to people seeing the
&gt;camper. When I drove my bug, everyone stopped me with a &quot;I used to have one
&gt;of these&quot; stories. With this, people just seem amazed. Is it my location,
30
&gt;miles East of Atlanta, or are we just the lucky ones?
