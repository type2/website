Art,
Now you know the SUV'ers curse! Seriously, could you tell the list what all 
the suggestions have been, which you have done, and a bit of history of the 
malady that might prove relevant to the diagnosis? Off the tip of my head, I 
thought of excess friction in the drive train (dragging brakes), and 
possibly that the wire between the Temp II sensor and the &quot;brain&quot; is broken. 
But if we all had a better idea of the answers to the above questions, we 
might do better. A last thought is that if you can get an exhaust emissions 
reading from a smog tester then at least we'd know where the mixture stands. 
Here in California you can get an &quot;off-line&quot; measurement for about $15.
