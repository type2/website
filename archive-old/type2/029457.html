&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; The subject line tells all.  I have read all the archives and gotten
&gt; some great info but...
&gt; I am stumped.  The red light in my '70 westy used to glow all the time
&gt; at night with the lights on. I replaced the generator with a Super 75
&gt; by Kymco and deleted the possibilities of a faulty generator and
&gt; regulator.  Now the light only glows when the turn signals, and brakes
&gt; are applied.  My guess is a bad ground, but I am a clueless math
&gt; teacher.  What do you all think?  Thanks

I've found that the light glows dimly most of the time, due to the length
of the wires.  What the wire does is compare the voltage at the voltage
regulator with the voltage at the fuse block.  If the generator is
working, the voltages will be the same and the light will remain off.  If
the generator isn't working, the voltage at the regulator will drop and
current will flow from the fuse block (supplied by the battery) to the
regulator, lighting the bulb in the circuit.

Unfortunately, there is a bit of a flaw in the system.  Resistance in the
wires from the battery to the fuse block causes a voltage drop when
current flows to the fuse block.  This causes a voltage difference which
causes current to flow from the voltage regulator through the bulb to the
fuse block.  This current can cause the bulb to glow dimly.  

If you draw more current from the fuse block by using the turn signals,
brakes, etc., which share the same circuit as teh warning liights, you
will increase the voltage difference and the brightness
of the bulb's glow.

This is really a minor problem.  Unless your wiring is really bad, the
glow will be minimal and only visible at night.

If the generator light comes on for real you will know it.  It burns as
brightly as the fires of hell, especially if you are way out in the
boonies at night!

particularly when there is a calculus problem to be conquered.
