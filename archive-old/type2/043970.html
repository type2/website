&gt; I have a defective auto mechanic gene and could use some help.  I just
&gt; bought a '70 Westfalia because it was rust free and the engine was
&gt; supposed to have been rebuilt.  I would like to fix the interior and
&gt; keep this running for as long as I can (10 years+).  Now I find that
&gt; this was the year before the doghouse oil cooler (my usual great
&gt; hindsight).  I read conflicting opinions on how to most effectively keep
&gt; the engine cool.  What are the thoughts of the experts out there on the
&gt; following ideas?

&gt; 1. adding a full flow oil filter.

Not a bad idea, but be aware that you are also adding complexity.  The
hoses have to be plumbed and you will get a loss of oil pressure in the
hoses and filter.  This system can work well if it is designed well, but
be sure you know what you are doing.

&gt; 2. adding a 1 1/2 qt. oil sump.

Not a good idea.  Carrying more oil around doesn't make your engine run
any cooler.  It's a good idea if you are experiencing rough terrain or
high side loads, but neither of these apply to a bus.  The worst thing
about these sumps are the loss of ground clearance.

&gt; 3. adding a doghouse oil cooler (is this possible?).

An excellent idea.  You will have to scrounge up a few parts, but most of
them are readily available.  Since VW did this themselves, you are assured
of a well-engineered design.  The only tough part is the front tin, which
was only made in '71.  Other tin can be modified without too much trouble
to do the job.

&gt; 4. ?

How's your tin?  Be sure that all the tin is present, installed correctly,
and in good condition.  This can be time-consuming, but the result is a
cooling system you can depend upon.
