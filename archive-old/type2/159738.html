&gt; In my experience it is that it worth the extra cost to run high octane

Really?  My Mustang has 10.2 to 1 compression and it runs on regular. 
My Mercedes has 22 to 1... well okay, it's a diesel.  :-)

But seriously, I can't think of a single car/truck built in the past 40 
years that has lower compression than a bus.

I am a firm believer that regular gas is a better buy than premium, even 
with a minute MPG increase factored in (if it even exists).  If your 7.6 
engine is pinging on regular, there is something wrong with it.  Too 
much timing, damage to the piston or combustion chamber, overheating, 
bad gas, etc..
