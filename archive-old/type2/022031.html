Subject: tool for 12-point bolts on tranny
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Getting ready to drop the engine/tranny in China Cat. She's the new family 
member, and our first VW. I've read somewhere about the tool used to get at 
these special bolts...either what to use as a makeshift or where to buy it. 
Is this something available at the NWFLAPS? If so, what it the size 
nomenclature?

I know I've read this somewhere, but I've looked all through the library and 
the one relevant article only mentions the tool, not giving any 
specifications.

I think I must have read about it in a long-ago Bob Hoover post somewhere :-)

TIA/Don Carron
Rockford TN

going out to the 'Cat now.
