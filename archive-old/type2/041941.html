Subject: saggy rear end-NOT

Looking at my saggy rear end on my '78 this weekend, I was contemplating a
rear torsion adjustment vs. air shocks. After closer inspection I realized
that I only have maybe an inch of adjustment up before the arm (spring
plate?) hits the stop - or - one more inch and its fully extended.  Air
shocks or an adjustment as I understand it can't raise it anymore, right? So
instead of a saggy rear end, I have an extra springy front. None the less,
it still looks like its taking a pee.
Is this a common problem? I suppose I could carry a few cinder blocks in
front with me or get a really fat girl friend.....sorry
