Hey, appropriate heat output is relative: 5000 BTU is sufficient down to 
about 20 degrees F, assuming you have a standard pop-top camper.

My 5000 BTU heater was not sufficient at 10,000 ft elevation and sub-zero 
temperatures, even though I took pains to insulate the pop-top. (I've just 
recently installed a 12,000 BTU propane heater to remedy the matter...)
