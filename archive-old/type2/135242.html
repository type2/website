Subject: [T2] Baywindow Popout Glass &amp; Fiamma Rack

Tony,
       I think the odds are you would win your bet.  Some ~20 years ago I had a 
Dodgy van in which the PO had installed a pop-up hatch, maybe 12&quot; square, on 
the roof toward the rear of the van.  When I would open this hatch, I would get 
a distinct smell of exhaust at speed.  Never checked it with a smoke bomb... I 
was convinced when I got dizzy after an hour's driving time.  On another van, 
the PO had installed Jalousie windows in the rear side locations.  Same result, 
only more so.

I still have an aftermarket sunroof, guessing 15&quot; x 30&quot;, that I never got 
around to installing.  Maybe someday I will cut the roof and put it in; but you 
can bet your virtual bucks it will go up toward the front of the van.  

Friday content: if anyone is interested in the sunroof, the price would be 
verrrry reasonable.  Glenn

&lt;&lt; (1) Back when I was still brain-storming my resto, I recall coming across
custom popout glass and frame for the rear hatch of a Baywindow.  Anyone
know the vendor or have a link?
&gt;&gt;
Just for the empirical evidence, I used a plumber's smoke bomb wired
underneath the bus and had a buddy follow me as I drove...The smoke
came out from the bottom of the bus and went straight up the back
to the roof...Anybody with severe oil leaks will note the same effect...
The oil comes out  from under the back of the bus and is deposited
on the engine hatch and the rear hatch and window...Now, I can't say
for sure that a pop out hatch window will suck exhaust fumes back
into the bus, but I might bet a virtual buck that it does... ;-(
