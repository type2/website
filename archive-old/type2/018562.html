There are enough newbies on the list that this hint need repeating.

Don't back up into a curb.

The curb may be high enough that it will catch your muffler, and
possibly damage it or may bend/break/tear your exhaust pipe.

It is worth the effort to step out of your vehicle and see how things
fit in the back.

And it is always worth the extra effort to be careful with your type 2,
in driving, parking and repair.
