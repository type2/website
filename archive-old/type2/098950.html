Subject: Re: [T2] pop top cracks.

Fiberglass matting and polyester resin--the same stuff it is made of
will repair it permanently--

Forget about &quot;cavin and pavin&quot; the top with bondo--it won't last a
week---

 With a little time and effort with the right stuff--it will be as good
as new---

Later,

Terry

type2_at_type2_dot_com Subject: [T2] pop top cracks. 
On the front of my 78 pop top there are two cracks about 2 inches long.
They are on either side of the latch. How would I fix them? Bondo? or do
I need a new top? 
Thanks.
Brennan.
