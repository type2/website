&gt; I have 3 wires.  brown, red, and black...all appear to be stock.

&gt; On the button there are 3 connections. 15, K, and the connector for
&gt; the light plug in the switch.

Adam,

The connections for the dual circuit warning light are as follows:

Terminal      Wire         From

K             Red          brake switches
15            Black        fuse block
31            Brown        ground

On '78/9 buses there is a fourth wire:

61            White/Green  Switch behind parking brake handle
