Subject: RE: [T2] 77 Gas cap NLA

Thanks for the cap suggestions. I have found a stock one locally, but will
keep after market suggestions in mind when I loose this one . . .

Hopefully someone will pick up to stock cap lines again.

You guys are the greatest,
Chris

Chris-
         Stant has one for your bus, but its not listed in the catalog. I
found one
by measuring an existing one and taking a tape measure into the local Pep
Boys
and going through the racks...Not the prettiest, but at least it fit and
keeps
the gas in and the riff raff out ;-)
