&gt;
&gt;&gt;1.  The stock master cylinder was of a single design.  Can I purchase an
&gt;&gt;aftermarket dual cylinder design which will fit?  The official VW repair
&gt;&gt;guide for the 63 to 67 busses shows one and how to repair it.  This must
&gt;&gt;have been on option.  Was it?
&gt;
&gt;The dual was '67-only.  You might be able to do some clever engineering to
make a dual work on an earlier bus.  I'm sure of it.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;2.  I have heard talk about a vaccuum assist reservoir to aid in braking.
&gt;&gt;Does my 1966 bus have one or is this only on 68-on busses?
&gt;
&gt;68 and later...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;3.  Seriously, what must be done to convert from 6 volt to 12 volt?  Can
&gt;&gt;I buy a kit with instructions on how to do this?
&gt;
&gt;To do it _right_ you need gen/alt, battery, flywheel, starter, wiper motor,
lights, relays, light switch/wiper switch...  I prolly even missed a few.
Too many people only do the gen/alt, battery and lights, 'cause thats the
path of least resistance.  Ha!  Resistance!  Get it?  Ohm watt a good one!
&gt;
&gt;&gt;4.  I have been told that there is a bracket that attatched to the rear
&gt;&gt;of the engine to act as some kind of support.  When I go to put an engine
&gt;
&gt;You would not have had the rear mount on this year of bus.
