Jack-a-Roe,

The arms are not specific to which cylinder they are over, but they are
specific to which valve they are over - exhaust or intake. 

I believe the one with more 'meat' between the arm and the bearing part goes
over the intake, but i could be wrong - no visual reference available now.  
If you install them wrong, the adjuster screw will not line up correctly over
the valve stem.  It is fairly obvious when you have the wrong arm over the
wrong valve.  Compare the rocker amrs and notice the differences.

Does this make sense to you?  Look at your arms - check your bentley.

I'd say you have them wrong. - i almost did it wrong till my local VW guru
said &quot;No! They ARE different!&quot;  You probably haven't damaged anything but
maybe an adjuster screw or two...

&gt; Hi listers---
&gt; 
&gt; I finally got my poor old 74 Westfalia to run (I rebuilt the engine, got
&gt; it in, it was backfiring a lot--got enough advise from the group to get
&gt; it sputtering). But it's not really running good enough to drive (or
&gt; even idle, or, well even speed up).
&gt; 
&gt; So I know I have some carb adjustment to do. But before going there, I'm
&gt; concerned about my rocker arms. It seems that on some cylinders, the
&gt; rocker arm itself easily clears the valve spring, but on others, it the
&gt; curved part of the arm is touching the spring. I'm afraid this is not
&gt; letting the valve close completely.
&gt; 
&gt; It's a 1.8 L.  Are the rocker arm assembly specific to the cylinders? I
&gt; had seperated them out carefully, but my neighbors dog ran though the
&gt; shop and scattered them across the floor while I was putting it back
&gt; together.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help (and quick help if possible since I'm going out to work on it
&gt; in about an hour) would be very appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
