Now I'm all messed up. My question was what do you do if you measure your
saggy butt bus and find that your instruments tell you it is level. One or
two of the answers I got back made reference to leveling the bus on jack
stands BEFORE measuring the spring plate angle. Doesn't that defeat the
purpose? Aren't we trying to tell how much the bus deviates from level as it
sits attached to Mother Earth on its own four wheels? Or am I totally
missing the point here?
