Also, if you don't want to use bleach, use vinegar!
Same drill as below, , , , , , , ,

&gt; I would go with a bleach-and-water solution to clean the water tank.
&gt; Mine's not aluminum (it's plastic), but I use this method on it and it
&gt; works great.  I use a ration of about a 2 or 3 ounces bleach per 5 gallons
&gt; water (same ratio that I use for sanitizing my homebrew equipment).  I fill
&gt; the tank up with the bleach/water combo, drive her around the block a few
&gt; times to slosh the solution around in there a bit, then come home and
&gt; fill/drain/fill her with warm water several times to rinse and clean the
&gt; bleach out of there.  Once I feel that the tank is clean and free of
&gt; bleachiness (that is, when the smell of bleach is no longer apparent), I
&gt; fill it with clean cold water and that is it.  I was advised early on NOT
&gt; to use any kind of soap or sudsy cleaner in the tank, as it would be nearly
&gt; impossible to remove the suds (ever try to rinse out a dishsoap bottle?) --
&gt; and I extend the same advice to you.  The bleach/H2O route works well.
