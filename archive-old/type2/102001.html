Subject: Re: [T2] Just got a no seatbelt ticket... has there been a
  study done  saying that belts in a bus would do nothing to prevent
  injury?

&gt; no where to go in the event of a collision. I may be
&gt; wrong. 

there is another good reason for seatbelts, I was once bumped by a truck
at 55mph and except for the seatbelt would probably have been on the floor
between the seats, not spinning that steering wheel like banshee keeping
the bus headed in the right direction,  some body damage to bus, but no
body damage to Bob
