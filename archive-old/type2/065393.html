Subject: Anyone in Orange County - split bus look?

*sigh*

Here we go again......is there anyone in/near Orange County who would enjoy
checking out a split bus for me?

I'm not sure its the buy of the century  - the guy says it is a lo rust
running bus (but I've heard that from the owner of just about every bus
I've looked at) and said he would send a video to me (this is like 3-4
weeks ago now).

No video and he is advertising it again which makes me think that there's
gotta be something wrong somewhere or it would have sold by now.....but if
you're close and it's no hassle please contact me via email......

Thanks

Rob K.
