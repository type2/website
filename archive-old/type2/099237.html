Subject: Re: The reason it's called E-BAY is.......it's not TYPE2!

 &gt;And to address the issue of &quot;how come vendors and not me&quot; - here's my
 &gt;thought: Ron Salmon sells parts day in and day out, but he doesn't post &gt;his
 &gt;entire catalog on the list every day. Maybe once in a while we get &gt;postings
 &gt;about new parts. He doesn't spam the list every day with postings. But if
 &gt;everyone posting an e-bay item decides to send a note to the list, you're
 &gt;going to have a lot of clutter.

the last Digest I got contained 24 messages.

2 were from the Bus Depot, suggesting that they carry a specific part, and 
included the part # and the price.

1 was from another vendor.

You all can read, so I needed rehash the details. I offer this:

If a post contains a price posted by a vendor, referring to itself, that 
is a commercial advertisement.  Everyone knows how to work e-mail, and can 
quite easily e-mail someone off the list that has asked about a part.

If a vendor wants to provide helpful information, that is wonderful. 
Sometimes a vendor will know what exists and what doesn't, and that is 
good information.

It doesn't take rocket science for a person that needs to buy that part to 
followup, in private, with that vendor to find out about pricing and 
availability.


I have no beef with any of the parts vendors. This list shouldn't amount 
to a form of targeted advertising, though.  The guys that are online could 
easily set up their own mailing lists for people that are interested in 
receiving periodic e-mail about parts and specials.

oh how I pine for the days of the 5 line .sig file....
