Subject: New to list

Greetings from the Great White North!

Since I have no desire to be classified as one of
&quot;78 Sniveling Unknown Lurkers :)&quot; I thought I would introduce myself.
I hail from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and am an avowed 
VW lover.  Unfortunately, the only VW I own currently is an 89
Jetta GTX.  I am searching the prairies for a restorable splittie 
and not having much luck. To that end, if anyone knows of some 
contacts in Alberta, I would greatly appreciate learning of them.
(I'm not holding my breath though)

I have been monitoring this list for a couple of days and I am 
really enjoying the discussion and the helpful tips!  Hopefully I'll
remember the pertinent stuff when I finally get my ultimate VW!  
(If not, I guess I can always ask again eh?)
