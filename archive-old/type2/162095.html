Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Ceramic Coating Exhaust

Hi Doyt,

The purpose of the coating is to prevent rust.

The extra cost for ceramic coating is more than offset by the gain in  
longevity of the exhaust components. With a typical complete exhaust  
system now costing approx. $700-$1000 to get from the engine to the  
tailpipe, you want that investment to last as long as possible.


Happy trails,

&gt; Advantages of doing the ceramic coating in the first place elude  
&gt; me.  I considered wrapping my headers to retain the heat in the  
&gt; exhaust gas so that it would arrive in the heat exchangers at a  
&gt; higher temperature. I figured it would help heat the inside of the  
&gt; bus. Anybody know why ceramic coating the headers seems to be  
&gt; &quot;popular&quot; ?
