Subject: free shipping on all engine and clutch  parts from BUStedVW_dot_com

Hello folks,

Here is our latest contribution to the list.

We have just completed adding all engine part illustrations to the catalog.
Now you can see every part for every engine. Not all parts are available yet
but, you can at least request a part by number. To celebrate we are offering
free shipping on all new or used engine and clutch parts, for a limited
time. If you need a part added to an illustration please click on the link
at the top of the illustration (most parts are available but, just haven't
been added). As usual if you have any questions please feel free to contact
us via phone or e-mail. Thanks for helping us build our catalog. It is our
goal to become the source by offering every part for your 1968-1979 bus.

To order with free shipping, select &quot;type 2&quot; as shipping method on the check
out page or call to place an order. All items will be sent ups ground. A
$3.00 handling fee is added to each order.

Always friendly,
Joe Mitchell
