&gt; I have new replacement seat stand mats made by WCM I think. Problem is that
&gt; they don't fit.  They are not the right shape. They are cut too low in the
&gt; back (vertical surface) behind the seat stand above the large oval
&gt; indentation. Furthermore, the overall design is different than original. The
&gt; repo set is two peices of rubber whereas the original had three I think.
&gt; Missing and somewhat combined in the two peices is the skinny peice that
&gt; totally covers the rear of the top behind the seat (horizontal surface).

According to GoWesty! the reproductions they sell (WW or WCM most likely)
only fit 68-76. We know there were mid years changes in 76 to the seats and
you've got a 78/79 bus...
