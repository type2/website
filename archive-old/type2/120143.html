Subject: Axle swaps for 70 bus?

I'm looking at a 70 bus.  It's pretty nice but
I'm not big on the drum brakes.  The guy at the
shop has several late buses and mentioned that
he'd swap the front end out of a late bus to give
me discs.  He didn't specify whether it would be
the 71-72 style or 73+.  I think for the 73+
style the entire steering box and all would have
to be changed.  How difficult is would these
swaps be?  Are there options other than swapping
the entire front axle?   Just the hubs etc.  

How about the rear end so that I'd have the same
wheel bolt pattern.  What has to be changed?   

TIA,
Ray
