Subject: re: Tools

Here's my 2 cents:

My SO bought me a full Craftsman set, including the tool chest, last
Christmas.  Before that I was using a mixed bunch of cheap tools.  I was
always frustrated by the cheap crap. I'm sure that there are better tools
than Craftsman, but compared to what I was using, they are MAGNIFICENT!  I
actually feel like a better mechanic.  There is something very satisfying
about carefully wiping down your tools after completing a project, something
I never did with the other junk.

I can't believe that I'm the first one to recommend this, but I think Muir
has a pretty complete tool list.  I used his stage approach when I first
started accumulating the cheap stuff and it worked well. If you don't have
his book, you really should.  I know that some of the procedure don't work
for every bus (I've got a '79 and a lot of it doesn't apply) but it's
excellent reading and you really learn a lot about your bus.

I do think that a 1/4&quot; set is very useful for little stuff, I find that I
use it quite often, but that's just me.

Get a telescoping magnetic pickup tool.  Saved my *** many times!
