Subject: Exhaust-like noise coming from an engine with brand new heads

Nick, 
       I haven't done an aircooled Veedub engine for 2 or 3 decades; but I do 
remember being advised always to grind-in a new head.... i.e., pull the jug, 
rotate it in the head with some valve grinding compound, clean like crazy, and 
then replace the jug, install the head, etc.  This may or may not be the best 
of current thinking, but it worked for me on a few dozen engine rebuilds.  
Good luck in resolving your problem....  Glenn

------- REF ----------

Immediately upon starting the Bus the very first time after reinserting the
engine, it was clear that I now had an exhaust leak-like sound coming, I
believe, from the right side.  My first guess was that I didn't mate the
heater boxes or the muffler to the heads correctly but as far as I can see,
they look fine and the few accessible nuts seem tight.  The second guess, and
far more serious (and costly and embarrassing), is that I had exceeded the
22#-23# torque...
