Scott,
I've never tackled this job or known anyone who has, but I happen to have a
transmission out of a '71 that I thought I would use in my '68 . I bought it
at the advice of my friend who told me it would be a good deal even if I
didn't use it as it only cost me 150$ . Seeing as how my transmission is
fine, I will pass it on to you at the same price if you are interested.

&gt;Hey all!
&gt;
&gt;I've noticed that my transaxle is leaking at the side-covers. A local
&gt;mechanic is quoting $85 per side to replace the seals. Have any of you
&gt;tackled this job and if so how tough a job is it?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
