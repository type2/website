If the hubcap can be here by Aug  I will make sure that it gets to Denver by
for the Bandimere show and then I know that some one from Bus Heaven
(arizona)can get it further West or we could get it here by the fall and
have NQ and I take it west.  But the rate it is moving it will probably rust
away before getting to the land of no rust

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; If DaveE hauls it  up to EveryBus on Friday the will be lots of
oppurtunity
&gt; to send the package( It was a package when it last rolled through
Greensboro
&gt; several months ago and by now it should need a hand truck just to  move it
&gt; from bus to bus) West or even to THE GREAT WHITE NORTH:) Ted could bring
it
&gt; back to Ohio or Jamie could turn this into an international incident.
&gt;
&gt; We have to be careful though. DaveJ will be at E-bus and he might wanna
&gt; polish the hubcap again if he is not too busy convincing the rangers that
&gt; burning a case would be fun for everyone :)
&gt;
&gt; See ya Friday at E-bus!
