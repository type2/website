Thread-Topic: [T2] gear oil can be red or black - GL-6?

Subject: RE: [T2] gear oil can be red or black - GL-6?

Can we use GL-6 in our GL-4 trannies? I know that GL-5 is corrosive to
our synchronizer rings. Is there a website that describes the
differences between GL- 4, 5 , and 6?

That red colored gear oil meets and exceeds all VW specifications
 It is GL-6, and EP
(I don't know what the GL-6 means, but the EP
stands for Extreme Pressure lubricating abilities)
