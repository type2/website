Suggest if you don't have the tools and skills to confirm running
clearances, you should hire the machinist to assemble the bottom end
including mounting the flywheel with spec end play. Make them responsible
for the assembly complete. You can check if it turns freely and has proper
end play BEFORE you pay the invoice.

Find a machinist skilled with euro engines. If they do mostly Fords and
Chevys or Asian, do your self a favor and find better. In the NW US, you
can't beat NW ConRod for spec or better VW assemblies, day in and day out.

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;Have a question for y'all....
&gt;
&gt;Here is the scoop.
&gt;
&gt;I took my block in to be line bored by a local shop, it was a 73 AK case
&gt;from a high mileage motor, the thrust didnt need to be cut, and the
&gt;bearing saddles were in good enough shape that I almost decided not to
&gt;have it line bored... in hindsight I wish I hadnt had it done.
&gt;
&gt;So anyway, I tried to put a *new* Bugpack cast counterweighted 69 MM crank
&gt;in it. The counterweights hit the #2 bearing saddle,

Such is the norm for aftermarket parts. Custom massage to fit spec in not
unusual with non-spec parts.

&gt;
&gt;When I bolted it together and turned it it would stick,

 I took it in to get assembled to a
&gt;shortblock by the local place that line bored it. They used another new
&gt;set of mains. and did have to clearance the saddle some more for the
&gt;crank, so I figured that was the deal.

Did they mount the flywheel or did you?? What was the endplay?? Did it turn
freely by hand 2 full revolutions or more??

&gt;
&gt;After 2-3 days of runing, the bottom end locked up solid. here are some
&gt;guesses as to cause, what do you think?

Don't waste your time with guesses. Pull the drain plate and check for
chunks and slivers. Then pull it out, tear it down and inspect the parts.
The cause of the failure may well be obvious, but sometimes the root of the
problem may require calibrated micrometers and skill to determine. 

Lots of things can cause a motor to seize. Lots of things can cause
overheating: clearance problems (ring end gaps or bearings too close) poor
lubrication (oil pump setup, crud in oil galleys, sunken carb float or
loose jet), the wrong lubricants for breakin, heavy foot or loads during
breakin, sporty spark advance, wizbang plugs or auxillary oil coolers. Just
a few guesses which have little meaning compared to teardown and inspection.
