Subject: Cut &amp; Buff

Hiya All,

I'm going to get the Duck painted here pretty soon and I was wondering about 
something the painter mentioned to me.  He said that it was common to NOT 
polish (cut and buff) a truck (or van) as much as one would do when finishing 
off a car.  All of you with painting experience, what do you think about that?

I really don't know that much about the technical end of auto painting.  I do 
know that &quot;cut and buff&quot; refers to dressing down the surface after the 
paintjob to bring out the lustre in the paint.  Is the painter's statement 
true?  Is cutting and buffing usually not done to the same degree on a truck 
or van?
