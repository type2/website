Subject: Thermodynamics Question

Ok, it's obvious that denser air = better air cooling in our busses.

BUT: What about density caused by high humidity? 

While humidity causes people to sweat more due to saturation of the
air (sweat can't evaporate), it seems to me that it would have
superior cooling capabilities for our engines compared to the same
temperature dry air.

Just curious. =D
