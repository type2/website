&gt;Just a note that I have obtained a shipment of NEW, not rebuilt, Bosch SR87X

&gt;sell for about $140 plus a $40 core deposit (so you have to ship your old
&gt;one back).
&gt;
&gt;While they last, they are $99.95, brand new, with no core deposit. They are
&gt;already on the website (still using the SR87X part number), or of course you
&gt;can order by part number toll-free at 1-888-819-DEPOT.

I say jump, jump on it with a passion, if you want to guarantee the lowest
possible cost to replace that 20 year old original at any time between now
and when the original begins to show the symptoms of having served in
upstanding manner a full functional life. Put one on the shelf 'cause you
know you will keep the DM machine longer than it's gonna take to use up
what's left of the original.

If you wait till failure of the orginal a few years from now, you may only
be able to get a reman from the New Bosch reman factory in MEXICO, and pay
much more than this no brainer price for junk.

I will be contacting my clients with this opportunity so they may chose to
act or be dumb as they will.

Opportunity be-a-knocking real hard here. Value up the ying-yang. If youze
an ape, take a branch, strip off the leaves, break it to suitable length,
and poke yer stick at this termite. Pure protein with a measure of fat
throwed in fer nothin', yum.
