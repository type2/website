Subject: Re: [T2] Syn oil to regular oil- Dangerous?

Joel,

Yes, it's expensive, but I believe it is worth it.

I don't change oil every 3,000 if I use synthetic....that is sure to get a
few flames&lt;grin&gt;.

Some of my cars use syn and some I use the reular stuff.

In my opinion....the synthetic lasts longer than dino.

I have some water cooled vehicles that I use only synthetic...go 10,000
miles between changes.  I *never* use any oil between changes in them and 
I drive them hard.  The last one I treated that way had 127,000 on it and
still used *no* oil between changes...

As always....Your mileage may vary.  :-)

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Volks,
&gt; 	I'm looking at a vanagon that all it's life has had a diet of Mobil 1 
&gt; Synthetic oil. Being on the  verge of owning this van, and seeing how 
&gt; EXPENSIVE synthetic motor oils are, I'm wondering if it really is necessary 
&gt; to continue using the synthetic stuff. The van already has 130K on it and 
&gt; I'm looking for another 75K or so from it (without a rebuild (yes, it is 
&gt; totally possible)). Does anyone out there have any experience with switching?
&gt; I guess I've just never been convinced of the advantages of the synthetic 
&gt; stuff; at least not convinced enough to go from about a buck a quart to 
&gt; almost 4 bucks a quart.
&gt; My &quot;head smarts&quot; are telling me to just bite the bullet and keep going with 
&gt; the synthetic, but my wife (and our one income and two children) are making 
&gt; me look into the possibility of doing it cheaper.
&gt; I always get ADVICE when I post to the lists, but what I really want is 
&gt; actual, real world, experiences. Of course, all responses, experience or 
&gt; otherwise, will be greatly appreciated.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Joel
