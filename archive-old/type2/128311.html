Subject: [T2] dual solex carb defective?

ok i bought a set of 34mm carbs(solex) from cbperformance a month or more back and have had nothing but problems from them cant seem to get the adjusted right and keep having problems from one of the two carbs....
 
the flap (choke)on one of them will not close unless i hit the accelerator and then the flap will come loose but still is tight and will not close....
so taking a closer look i seen a small piece of looked like copper sticking out of one of the ends of the flap looked to me like  a piece of somehting that had fell in there...?
well i grabbed a pair of small needle nose and without any force it came out and there was two pieces there.... together they looked like a small circle or copper ring...? the ring together looks no bigger than a very small washer of some sort but copper looking...?
 
i need to know can i rebuild this or not..?course shouldnt have to buttttttttttt someone throwed it together it looks careless.......or in a hurrry or maybe accidents happen...?
i was told this morning that that little piece may or may not come with a rebuild kit...?
cant remember what he called it but will find out later,...from him tonight possibly or when he sees this post since he is a list member..
 
this really sucs... cbperformance has a no return policy and no garuntee thing going on which sucks even worse... 
i just need it fixed.. is there anyone out there that can help me with this that is experienced with duals...or carbs in general maybe...?
 
if all this looks foreign or cant understand what i am talking about feel free to ask questions...please.. this is a must ... i gave back the weber i was using and have about given up on these carbs.and ready to trash them even though one of the two seems to function very well..... i kept thinking it was all my fault till this morning when i realized that the carb has something wrong with it from whoever the person/s was that built it from cbperformance....
slack on there part but no blame i just got to get this thing fixed...
i can later on this evening try to take a picture of the piece that came out of it and post it up for viewing...
thanks for any or all help on this subject..
peace and love
chris
