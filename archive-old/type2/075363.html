And he even cut me a set of keys to code for a 62 DKW!!

&gt; I think this is the fellow that was up at BNNTA last year. He was from
&gt; Texas. Sure did nice looking work.
 
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;FWIW, Steve Sandlin over on the Vanagon list is a
&gt; &gt; locksmith well versed in VW keying.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And his prices were wonderful, as I recall.  All
&gt; &gt; around good chap who's hobby is helping us with ours.
