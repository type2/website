Subject: Front Seats

Two `77 bay front seat questions.

1. I've been offered a chance at a set of (westy?) seats that swivel, but
will still fit right into the mounting slides in my bay.  Does anyone have
an experienced opinion on these?  I'm trying for decent seats that will not
be hard on my back.

2. Looking down on the front seat mounts, me facing forward in the bus,
there are a pair of little plastic doodads, one on each mount.  They're
placed facing each other.  The right side one is mounted in what would be
the lower left-hand corner of the top of the upper seat mount area, and the
left side one is in the same corresponding spot on the other side.

It almost looks as if you could fit a small diameter rod between the two
seat mounts; though I'm not sure why one would want a rod just where you
would trip and break you neck on it trying to get into the back of the bus
from the front, or vise versa.
