Subject: re: upright engine in a '74?

&gt;Can a 1600 DP from a '71 Westy be easily installed in a '74?
&gt; What mods to either engine or bus are needed?

In Europe VW continued to supply buses with upright engines until end of
production in '79 (and even in some Vanagons!).

So you may have to get yourself some European tinware and contend with some
other bits and pieces but it is entirely feasible. However being the
(European) owner of a '77 1600 cc Westy I can tell you that the pancake
engines are very much to be preferred. More power and longer lasting. So my
advice would be to fix a broken engine or get another one rather than switch
to an upright.
