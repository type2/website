Subject: friday ramble

hey, it's friday - i get to ramble

well - the snow is here in central canada in a big way - got my bus
parked but i did see a 70's  westy driving into a doughnut shop this
morning - i was a little surprised as we are in the middle of a blizzard
- haha

i read a post recently  and the poster had a line like - 'if driving a
bus in winter makes a man out of me then what a man i am' - or something
like that - cool hey - so i figured this storing my bus for the winter
may not be the best idea - i figure i just have to dress warm - keep the
underneath clean of salt and sand - and park it on those all too common
minus 40 days

so that means i need to raise money to finish off a few repairs - the SO
tends to give me a hard time when i pump money in Ulysses (great name
hey, travel, travel, travel with lots of great adventures - but always
makes it back to ithaca - or im my case manitoba :)

so im on a fund raising quest im cleaning up stuff to haul to auction -
so far ive reupholstered the seat of a circa 1880's rocker, ive stripped
and am about to finish a 20's cherry wood table, then ill tackle this 6'
high (pine)  jam cupboard - ive still got tons of other stuff, maybe ill
redo a blanket chest or two - well see - one thing though - i can never
bring my self to auction my best prairie ethnic stuff - my desk is a
circa 1900 yellow and white  ukrainian farm house table - with a single
board top and cabriol legs - very primitive - with not one piece of wood
less than 1 1/4&quot; thick - god i love this stuff

anyway - on a sadder note - i wish josh's family all the best - i cant
imagine really how very hard this is for them - as well, i read recently
how most of us have at least two things im common - it seems to me that
most of us have a lot more than two things in common - it takes a
certain type of character and personality to go out and buy a 40 year
old vehicle  - spend tons of time and money on it - and still have
something that requires lots of maintenance, is cold, and is slow - if
id have bought a toyota van - id have a much warmer, faster and more
maintenance free form of transportation -  but really - there is no
question - i wouldnt even consider it - im a bus guy - as was josh and
all others on the list - seems to me that if you scratch a little below
the surface of most of us - you'll find people who have tons of things
in common - from politics to musical tastes to buses etc..  - anyway - i
my mind josh isnt like me - in many ways he is me - make sense?

well thanks for listening - and good luck to ya josh -
