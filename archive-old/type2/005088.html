FWIW, we have done a lot of testing using different oils, and have found
that Quaker State FULL (not blend) Synthetic 5-50 is outstanding. Oil temps
drop 15 degrees, and other engine temps stay the same or lower slightly.
It's tough to find though, and only recommended if you have a real filter on
your engine (unless you have $ to burn).

It's the best oil we have found; I love Kendall too if you like dino oils
(another tough one to fine some places)
