I had another conversation w/the owner of the '70 Dormobile and I continue to 
be intereste. A couple of people have responed to my posting yesterday. 
Thanks. I'm wondering now just how rare these are in the U.S.? This bus was 
shipped over by a previous owner who had bought it in Europe and toured there 
with it before shipping it home.
