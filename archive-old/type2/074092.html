&gt; if anyone is really interested you can buy a &quot;rising pressure
&gt; regulator&quot; from several sources...adjustable too.$$$$

the datsun/nissan regulator i posted about earlier is a rising rate type,
and swaps in with no other mods. it is also available at wrecking yards for
cheap. i am waiting for a reply from ray greenwood about the exact specs of
this unit. will post. i haven't read the book you refer to, but have
considered buying it several times. so many great things to blow money on!
