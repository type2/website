Subject: RE: Mystery Noise and my solution

This definately sounds like the axle nut to me too. Same thing happened
except all bearings were in good shape and the CV joints were new. Basically
the shop I had do the brakes for me tightened the axle nut like a US car
would be done. This nut should be put on with about 250 lbs torque so if you
can spin it (the one with the problem) without a cheeter bar and standin on
it then you probably found your problem.

I use a 3/4&quot; drive breaker bar with a six foot pipe over it on a 1 13/16
socket to get the job done.

Mine wouldn't quit this blasted noise no matter how tight I got it and it
burnished the mating surfaces. So I ground the nut and the hub mating
surface flat so I wouldn't have to buy parts. Did this about a year ago and
not a problem since. It, like you said was VERY LOUD too.

If you search the archives for this, a little over a year ago I wrote a
detailed how to on the repair.

BTW FWIW YMMV and yada yada yada...

it sounds like something metal scraping everytime the wheel goes around
(very loud).  However, when I pull away from the traffic light, it doesn't
make a sound.  I've also tried driving slowly without having my brakes on
and it still makes this awfull noise.  Then, I jacked up the back of the Bus
(another question here) and spun the tire. Not a sound.
