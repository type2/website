&gt;&gt; Greetings all,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I'm looking at having a stereo system installed in my '74 Westy.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; There doesn't seem to be much to support the radio inside the dash.  I'm
&gt;&gt; almost positive that I'll be putting some 6x9's under the couch, but not
&gt;&gt; sure of where to put speakers in the front.  I'm not looking for super
&gt;&gt; volume or crazy bass, just pleasant quality sound that will overcome engine
&gt;&gt; and wind noise.
&gt; 
&gt; I installed a shelf under the dash (similar to the splitty shelf).  Two
&gt; small Radio Shack Minimus box speakers sit on the ends of the shelf.  Good
&gt; sound, but if you're a Golden Ear (tm) you may want something better.
&gt; 
&gt; You can get similar results with surface-mount auto speakers, but I had
&gt; the others sitting around.
&gt; 
&gt; I supported the stereo at the dash opening (mine came pre-hacked).  the
&gt; rear of the stereo is supported by a strap attached to one of the holes in
&gt; the dash for the original speaker.

Hi,
I found these speakers that are coaxial inside a kidney shaped hard plastic
enclosure. On the bottom there is a screw hole. I placed them upside down,
facing forward on the ceiling just above and slightly forward of the z-bed
seat. They are mounted on the ridge of the opening where the small cot
attaches. (I have a 71). They are lower profile, but are only meant to be
for used for treble. I was thinking of hooking up a set of those computer
speakers that come with the subwoofer, from Cambridge Sound works. They are
only around $100.00 and sound great. I would put the subwoofer under the
z-bed. We shall see.
