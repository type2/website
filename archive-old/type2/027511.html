Well.  I think that was quite a response to my questions.  Sorry if I asked 
the wrong question.  I didn't know busses weigh so much and I didn't know 
that 75mph was a scary speed for them.  I much rather take Jeff Thurlow's 
response which was nice and simple.  &quot;If You want to go 80 - 90 mphs you 
better stay with the jetta....70 is about max for a bus.&quot;  Well.  With that 
out of the way.  It is a 1973 bus with the bug motor mounts.  With that in 
mind and the fact that I am willing to spend up to 1,000 on a rebuilt or new 
motor what motor should I get to get the most optimum driveability on the 
highway WITHOUT going 60mph.  I now understand a little more about busses.  
Sorry to be asking such a stupid question.  I am really new to busses and 
air cooled VWs in general.  I am also looking for a place that has good 
motors with a cheap or low cost price.  Thanx people.
