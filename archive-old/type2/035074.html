Subject: Lawrence, KS engine problems/Riviera

Hey guys, I've talked to Jay via e-mail a number of times and he's really
in need of some help here. This is a true bus lover without enough
experience to do his own rebuild, but he's been a real diehard. Even
against pressure from his old lady now, you can hear him grasping, trying
to hang onto this sweet bus.

I think Jay's in the Lawrence, KS area.

Given that he drove the bus about 30,000 miles already, we know Jay can
live with the speed issue (slower *is* better, Jay), but is there anyone
out in his area that could lend a hand assessing the options. Maybe he
really just needs some head-torquing or maybe a head replacement.

Problem is, here's a guy who's getting burned by greedy mechanics and at
this point there's something really wrong with his bus and he's stuck. If
we're really all about keeping buses on the road and helping each other
out, here's a chance for someone out near Lawrence.

If someone can help him get a real diagnosis, I'll offer up some parts to
help him get on the road. I can even scare up an 1800 head, if that's
what's needed.

If not, one of your volks who want to own a Riviera, drop Jay a line. His
sounds like a great bus that should be on the road.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;I recently rebuilt a 2.0L type IV engine for my '75 camper van.  After
only about 30,000 
&gt;miles, I had a fire in the engine compartment (yes, it is fuel injected).
 The mechanic 
&gt;suggested installing a webber progressive carb because it was cheaper than
fixing the fuel 
&gt;injection. Two months and $1000 later I got it back, but it ran like sh*t.
  I then took it to 
&gt;another mechanic (wasn't at all happy with the &quot;VW Specialist&quot;) to have
the carb adjusted 
&gt;only to find out that I now have a major compression leak around the heads. 
&gt;
&gt;It seems no matter how much money or time I put into this thing, I can't
keep it going.   It 
&gt;has always seemed terribly underpowered also, even with a fresh rebuild.
The old lady says 
&gt;get rid of it so we can get a Vanagon camper because it will be more
reliable, get better gas 
&gt;mileage (we travel a lot), and has a real heater.
&gt;
&gt;Here are some of my questions:
&gt;	How many miles should I expect from a 2L Type IV?
&gt;	Could I retrofit a Vanagon engine in my Type 2?
&gt;	Would the Vanagon engine be an improvement?
&gt;	How about installing an american V6 (or similar)?
&gt;	Can I get an engine that can maintain the speed limit going uphill?
&gt;	How reliable is the Vanagon compared to a Type 2?
&gt;	What is going to be the most cost effective solution?
&gt;	Does anyone want to buy an ASI camper van with a very clean (99% rust
free) body? 
&gt;
&gt;I don't have a lot of money to sink into this thing.  I've already spent
over $4,000 and it still 
&gt;doesn't run.   Maintenance and break-downs are killing me.  I love the VW
camper style, but 
&gt;it doesn't do me any good if it won't go anywhere.
&gt;
&gt;Any advice or comments are appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Burned by VW love,
&gt;j. wade
