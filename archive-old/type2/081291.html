Subject: Re: [T2] '73 vs. '71

I am a relatively new bus owner, 1 year, but I have to chime in on this one.
The 71 has a powerbrake assist, called a servo (ask me how I know)  If you
felt unsafe, and the braking was hard, the servo is blown.  Period.  You can
get these remanufactured,(new over $400 if I remember correctly) and the
best source I found was out of Texas that actually rebuilds your core.
Just my $.02

Subject: [T2] '73 vs. '71


&gt; Hello Everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I own and drive daily a 73 bus that I purchased last July.  This is my
first
&gt; bus although I've driven bugs for the last 10 years.  On Saturday, I test
&gt; drove a 71 camper as I want to do some camping this summer.  I was
extremely
&gt; disappointed with the performance of the 71.  The steering felt loose, the
&gt; brakes had a hard time stopping the vehicle despite a recent adjustment,
and
&gt; we generally just felt unsafe.  The 71 has been maintained regularly by a
&gt; good VW mechanic.
&gt;
&gt; According to a longtime bus-driving acquaintence, my 73 drives as a stock
&gt; vehicle of that year should.
&gt;
&gt; So, I'm wondering about the performance differences between a 71 and a 73.
&gt; Are the larger disc brakes in the '73 the first brakes able to stop the
&gt; vehicle safely on their own?  The 71 needed the clutch to assist in the
&gt; slowing the vehicle if I was traveling in excess of 25mph.
&gt;
&gt; I guess I'm really just curious as to how a 73 should compare to a 71 when
&gt; both are running properly.  The obvious differences to me (at least on
&gt; paper) should be a stronger engine and slightly better stopping ability.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any feedback,
&gt;
&gt; Brian
