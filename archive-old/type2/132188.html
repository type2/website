&gt; What?  If I read this correctly, Gonzo recommends that you twist the wires

Yeah, the advice started out great then missed a critical step.

I've noticed you can get butt connectors that are heatshrinkable with a
inner middle section of solder. Doesn't seem like a huge time saver or
improvement but I thought I'd mention it anyway.

If the goal is to have the original look you can't beat non-insulated
terminals and a roll over crimper. I redid all the electrics in my engine
compartment that way while the engine was out to chase away any future
electrical gremlins.

BTW, does anyone know where to locate the insulated plug that connects D+,
D- and DF at the Bosch 70A alternator? It goes here:
