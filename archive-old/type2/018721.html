More or less.  I have a late bus servo on my '71.  I had to grind down a
bump on the inside of the longitudinal frame member to get it up in
there -- it's larger.

&quot;4. Can the installed servo be rebuilt?&quot;

Yes, check the archives for this.

&quot;The actual problem with the bus is: When I step on the brakes the pedal
stays down with brakes applied. Had this once before and it was a rusted
out servo that was the problem.&quot;

Make sure everything is adjusted correctly, a indicated in the Bentley.
Check and see if your master cylinder is leaking into the servo.
Sometimes you can just replace the m.c. and empty the servo of the fluid
that's collected there.
