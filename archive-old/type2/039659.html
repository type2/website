hey volks,
just a little friday commentary about karma, fate,
etc. that I came up with yesterday driving the bus to
work.   My alarm clock didn't go off yesterday morning
so my wife and I both got up late.   I hurried to get
ready and flew out the door about 15 minutes after I
was supposed to be at work.   About 3 miles down my
normal route, I come upon flashing lights...an
accident.   It was a head on crash that killed both
parties unfortuneately.   Driving past this horrible
scene got me to thinking, maybe the alarm didn't go
off for a reason.   That accident happened on the road
I take everyday, at the same time I would normally be
driving through.   Who knows for sure, but maybe next
time our busses wont start or break down at an
inopportune time, there are helping us out instead of
being a PITA.   Just a idea to think about the next
time your lovely bus doesn't go:)   It just might save
your life.   sorry for the rambling.
