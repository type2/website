Previous Owner

&gt; Are you saying the engine is crummy...or just all the extraneous
&gt; crap  on it. Steve from Volks Tech said it was a strong engine as

All the extraneous crap. The tin attached to the engine and the
location of the external oil cooler.
&gt; its a GEX engine.

If it hasn't sucked a valve yet then you probably got one of GEX's
good rebuilds. They're famous for horrible heads but the reports you
see on the net vary from &quot;replaced under warranty 3 times in the
first year&quot; to &quot;been running this GEX for 5 years with no problems&quot;.
