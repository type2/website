Subject: something's gone

So I drive my 79 bus to and from work on Friday, 40 miles. Everything's
fine, it's
running sweet. On Saturday I check the oil, it's on low so I add about a
pint, nothing unusual. I start it up, knock-knock-knock-knock... something
is
very wrong. The noise is coming from the drivers side of the engine, nothing
is visibly loose, it's something 'internal' (I'm a low tech user if you
haven't already
guessed!). It's quite a deep clacking noise. I turn the engine off and worry
for a
while, then start tinkering around.

To cut a long story short, I figured out (by pulling off spark plug cables
one by
one) that the engine is running on three cylinders. The cylinder that isn't
working
is the one on the drivers side, towards the back. Also, I noticed that the
spark
plug next to it, on the drivers side, has engine oil on it. I didn't remove
any of the
plugs, I'm just looking at the friendly non-sparking end! So now I'm really
worried. It's obviously got to go into the shop.

A few questions before I take it in:
1. Do you think it's wise to drive it in (2 miles)?
2. Is it odd that this happened when I started the engine cold, rather than
during
a long journey?
3. Could the knocking noise be caused by the cylinder failing to fire (i.e.
is it worth
me changing the spark plugs and wires before taking it in?).
4. The oil on the good plug and cable, it's bad isn't it? You can tell me,
I'm
ready for the truth! *sniff*

Thankyou, thankyou, thankyou in advance for your thoughts. I'm hoping your
input will help me avoid getting ripped off by my mechanic.

Sara.
