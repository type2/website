Subject: RE: Valve Adjusting Screw

I had the same problem after replacing all of my screws with aftermarket
screws - two different ones broke off while adjusting! The local VW dealer
was able to order a new set. When they arrived, the package said &quot;made in
Germany&quot; so I hope that this will solve the problem.

Good Luck,
Bill Moon

| I was out adjusting my valves today on my 1600 singleport and while
| tightening the bolt after setting on the screw on the feeler gauge at .006
| the whole screw and bolt cracked off.
|
| so, it seems the stud of the screw is still in the hole.  I'm assuming I
| cannot drive it.  any advice on how to fix it so I don't have to pull it
| into the mechanic.  Not sure how to get the stud out....I've never really
| worked on the engine parts except to set the valves.  Its number 3.
