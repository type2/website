Mladen, Zoran sends:

&gt; Won't work...hatch is too small for engine to through...

He's not trying to get the engine out through the hatch. He's wanting to
stick the end of an engine crane (like you use to get the engine out of any
other car besides an aircooled VW) into the hatch and use it to lower the
engine.

I don't think it will work on a Bus to 1973, but only because there's not
enough distance between the engine and the top of the engine compartment. On
a 74-up, where the Bus has both a rear hatch and a top lid, now that's a
different story. You'd need enough chain on the crane that the crane's boom
has to touch, or come real close to, the ceiling of the Bus. By the time the
engine's on the floor, the crane boom would still be above the rim of the
cargo door.

Bonus here: once you get the engine skidded out from under the Bus, you can
retract the crane boom, pick the engine back up and move it anywhere you
want.
