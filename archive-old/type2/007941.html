Bus Folks,

Thanks to all who responded to my brake query. The problem was indeed
improper rear adjustment. I found myself chasing the wrong problem because
I forgot Brother Ray's first rule of troubleshooting (look at the last
thing ya screwed with). Mr. Bus and I are again motoring and feeling fine.

Still raining, still dreaming,

Ray Carter
Portland, OR
