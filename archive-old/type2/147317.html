Hi Volks!

&gt;     I see tons of VW's in commercials and movies. I have a theory that
&gt; there is a bus or beetle in every movie made set in a time period when they
&gt; could have one. 

I think there aren't any in &quot;Driving Miss Daisy,&quot; just many
other gorgeous old cars.  The movie spans thirty-five years or
so, starting in 1950.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
