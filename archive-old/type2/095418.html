&gt;  Hey Seth,
&gt;   I bought an old 70 camper. It runs good, but the
&gt;gas pedal is messed up. I tied a string to the cable and pull throttled it
&gt;home. Are the pedal assemblies  the same for most years? If you are on a
&gt;board with folks here in the SF Bay Area, tell them I'll sell this for 
&gt;$500. Tent
&gt;has a rip. Straight body. Motor sounds good, but does leak oil out of most
&gt;major seals. New carb and axles.
&gt;
&gt;This gas pedal is really messed up, so let me know
&gt;how to fix it.
