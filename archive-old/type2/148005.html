Subject: Re: [T2] Wow...bus for sale

&lt;Folks,  isn't this the one that Don or Cris or someone drooled over and 
couldn't figure out how it looked so good on the showroom floor?&gt;

Well, I'm really a more late-bay kind of guy but this bus is really nice. I was ready to pick up the phone and buy it &lt;not!&gt; until he described it as &quot;bad ass&quot;. Seems sort of wrong... &lt;grin!&gt; He better not be driving it at 95 mph all day long. If he is the engine isn't going to be a very lived one... And he might be the first person to crash it. 

&quot;THE&quot; bus that I drooled over was the one that was in Nashville with very, very low miles. Was a late-Bay too. Pea soup green. Had I $20K I'd prob go buy a nice Eurovan Weekender and have it share bus duty with our '78 Westy.

Chris
