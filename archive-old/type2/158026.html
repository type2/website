&gt; i quit giving them my number cause it seems i started getting odd sales
&gt; phone calls....
&gt;   even though the clerk told me we WONT GiVE OUT YOUR INFO ITS FOR OUR
&gt; PERSONAL records only./.. yeah BS is what it is..
&gt;
BTW, NEVER answer any unsolicited emails... Even if the message says
something
about being removed from our mailing list...Answering just proves that
there's
someone at the address who reads the email and you could get even more... ;-(
