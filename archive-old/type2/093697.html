Subject: Thermostat- to fit or not to fit?

Hello

I was wondering if anyone out there could help me.  I have brought a new
recon engine from Dutch company VEGE.  I have come to dress the engine and
found that all the thermostat controls i.e the flaps, rod, spring and
thermostat itself had been removed from the old engine.   In order to try
and source some parts I called some local scrap yards and restoration
companies, they all said that they could get the parts for me but that they
wouldn't recommend I fit a thermostat.  They advised that if the flaps stick
closed which they have a tendency to do, then the engine will overheat and
this is not covered on my engine warranty.

My concern is that if I do not fit the thermostat then the engine will never
warm up the petrol will not burn correctly and both the performance and the
life of the engine (due to increased wear while running cold) will be
effected.  I live in the UK and as such we get some cold winters.  If I
lived in sunnier climes I may not worry as much.

I called VEGE who advised me to fit the thermostat for all of the above
reasons and that if I check the stat and that the flaps are clean and not
covered in dirt and grime from the roads then they should always work and
not cause any great problems.  The cynic in me says that VEGE would tell me
this as they know they will have to cover me on the warranty if the engine
wears quickly but that if I fit the thermostat like they say and it
overheats they will not have to cover me.

Can anyone give me some independent advise?

Thanks
