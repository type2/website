I am new and what does it mean when people say 'YOU?' Is that to 
everyone?

I drive 60-65 even though I know I should drive 55-60.  Even when its 
really cold and I just can't stand going even 65 and I go 75 everyone 
passes me.  I think its just on principle though, you can't be behind a  VW
Bus and be respected interstate driving-wise.

Well out here in Michigan where we now have our 65 mph speed limits
back, I continuously take my stock 1600 DP 71 bus around 75mph for
cruising... The top I've ever hit was around 82 mph per my Speedo...
82 isn't very healthy for it, but it runs great at 75, it doesn't even whine..
