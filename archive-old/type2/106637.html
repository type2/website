Subject: Re: [T2] bay tail light gaskets

&gt; &gt; As you can see it's neither half the length or full length. 411 941 123 is
 the part number.

&gt; The part number I'm looking for (73-79) is:
 411 845 235.  From what I can find out, it's NLA. If RTV is what everyone's using, I'll follow suit.  The
rope stuff, between the housing and the lens, is no big deal...you can get something close at the hardware
store.

Alan, you have numbers switched.
For 72-79, the seal between the body and the housing is 411 941 123.
And EKTA says it takes 4, 2 per side.
The seal between the housing and the lens is 411 945 235. EKTA says one per side.
