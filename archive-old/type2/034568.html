&gt; Hello all, while sorting through and throwing out a bunch of stuff ( due in
&gt; no small part to an impending divorce) I managed to toss the upper and lower
&gt; mounts for my ' 78 westys table( the two brackets that the &quot;L&quot; shaped table
&gt; support slides into) in the dumpster.

Your message just made me remember this.

    On my way to Woodstock 99 this summer, my bus did some weird stuff, and I had
to pull over on the side of NY I-90, just past a rest stop (I forget the name).
Anyway, I had that table in the back like it says in the manual, because it gets
in the way.  I wanted to look at the engine through the top hatch, so I threw the
table on the ground, and put the mattress on top of it.  Of course, when I got it
running again, I threw in the mattress and left the table there.  I realized this
quite a bit down the road.  It was the second &quot;Doh&quot; heard round the world in vw
experience.

    Anyway, I have these random mounts in my camper, with no table.
Unfortunately, the bus is in storage until march.  I hope you find some before
then, but if not, give a yell.

    Alternatively, if anyone happens to have a table and L shaped mount they
would like to part with (maybe it was found on NY I-90 west), I would be most
interested.

    Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
