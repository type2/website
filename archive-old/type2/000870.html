I wouold cehck out the Thermo-time switch &amp; the cold start valve.  The
thermo switch tells the cold start valve when to inject gas based on temp &amp;
time &amp; only when the starter is cranking.  It may be injecting too long or
the cold start valve may be leaking even when not injecting fuel.  Follow
the Bentley for testing the 2 components.  Hope this helps.

&gt; I am having a cold start problem as well in my 79 Westy 2.0L with auto
tranny. It cranks in the morning for about  5-10 seconds but won't start. I
turn off the ignition and crank again, but again no start. I go back to the
engine and lift the lid and can smell gas fairly strongly. In the time it
takes to go back to the front and sit down and start it again(aroound 15-20
seconds), it will at last fire on one cylinder, but still not start. I wait
about 10 seconds, and crank again, and it will finally fire up raggedly then
run fine. It's good for the rest of the day then. Any suggestions on this?
Seems like it floods in the morning on those first few fire-up attempts? Why
the gas smell?
&gt; Dazed and confused,
&gt; Courtney
