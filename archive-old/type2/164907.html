Subject: RE: [T2] Flux Core Welding Problems

All I know is that when you weld galvanized, it feels like you are a 70
year-old chain smoker with a hang-over trying to run down a cab. Besides, it
welds like crap. The intense zinc burn-off contaminates your &quot;inert&quot; gas
area thus rendering the weld poor at best. It also has a tendancy to kick up
so much spatter that it can clog your nozzle and pit your welding surface.
Flux-core welding on regular steel is crappy at best; welding galvanized
with a flux-core is almost impossible.

 

Zinc burn-off may be &quot;inert&quot;, but if it costs you a weekend in bed away from
your family, then that is as toxic as a getting the flu.

Jason,

DO NOT WELD GALVANIZED! It produces toxic burn off that can damage your
lungs and poison you. It also welds poorly and weakens at the weld area.

I am confused now. This link that Karl sent says that there is nothing toxic
about welding galvanized steel since the zinc vaporizes and then becomes
zinc-oxide.
