&lt;&lt; .the wiper moter is
 still making noise as if it is still working and the blades are trying to
 move, but only manage to make spastic little motions......any idea of what
 happened here??
 A small 2ndquestion while Im at it....any idea where I may be able to score
 an owners manual (Online or hardcopy)?
 
 Thanks,
 Scott Thompson &gt;&gt;
Scott,

I think your wiper arms have loosened up from the shafts.  Pop off the black
caps on the arms and tighten the nuts down.  If neither the arms OR shafts
move then the linkage has most likely fallen apart. I'm betting on the loose
nuts.  Happens all the time.  The owners manual should be obtainable from your
local VW dealer for less than $20.00.
