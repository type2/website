Subject: What the heck is this engine?!

Here comes some newbie stuff...

I'm getting ready to do my first tune-up on my Westy - had the first one
done by a professional when I first bought the thing, ready to do the
second one myself. So I open the engine compartment and get out the
Idiot Book, and start to look at the thing...

I was led by the PO to think that I had a 1600 DP in here. Seemed likely
- - it's a '71 Westy. And the engine certainly looked just like the
Mexican replacement I had in my ol' '75 Super. Never had a problem with
that vehicle - first one was the original, and after my sister reduced
it to a lump of molten metal, the second one came with a set of
instructions from the folks I bought it from...

So I'm trying to figure out what the timing for the Westy should be, and
I check the engine number. Guess what? My engine's number is &quot;H&quot;. Just
H, nothing following. Muir gives &quot;H&quot; numbers for 1500 engines, circa
1967... So what do I have here - a rebuilt case from a 1500? Is that why
the thing is working so danged hard? Man, I feel like an idjut, but why
the heck would you put a 1500 in a '71 bus?!

Question #2 is, of course - how should I time this thing? I'm going to
do it static; just can't figure out what the best timing for the thing
would be.

#3 - Whaddya think - should I replace the dist. with the 009 from my '64
wreck? The Westy has a Weber carb and a stock distributor. 

Sheesh. Nothing's easy. Good thing it started raining here and I can sit
and drink coffee and think about all this for a while... :)
