Subject: Adequate Paint Job?

First, let me say thanks to all of the helpful comments I received 
earlier on setting the timing - bus runs great now (even better than 
before!).

Now, on to the question...
There's been extensive discussions on how much a new paint job should 
cost.  My '65 still has the original paint, but is weathered in a few 
places and has some small patches of rust.  I'm not looking to 
restore this to showroom condition, but would like a paint job that 
looks ok but will protect the bus.  Nothing fancy, but maybe 2-tone.  
What's the going rate for something like this?  Is 3-5K for a show 
car?

Also, in a few words or less, what is involved in getting a bus ready 
to paint (or is there a faq or web site on this?)?

Thanks,

Greg
