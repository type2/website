Everything from the fuel filter onward is 7mm high pressure line. Use ONLY 
special high pressure line or you are asking for a fire.  I sell it for about 
$7 a meter as I recall, on my website. 

Ron, 

With all this talk about fires, I am planning to replace all the lines in my 
new '75 Westy next month, including if available, the fuel filler and vent 
lines.  I know that Ken Wilford at VanAgain sells a complete kit to replace 
all the fuel lines in a Vanagon.  Does the Bus Depot sell a complete kit 
versus just the 7mm line?  If you have a kit, what do I ask for when I call?  
If you don't, I for one think it would be a great idea if you could put 
together a kit for the bays so we could buy everything we need to replace the 
lines at once.

for sale)

sale also)
