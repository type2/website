Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Boo Thank You!

No, Thank you Buses by the Beach! We had a great time as usual. I'll keep it
short and sweet here but The Buses, Chili, Costumes, Conversation, Homebrew,
Campground, and seeing old and making new friends was all wonderful.

Our only regret is that the '78 wasn't able to make the trip. Hopefully next
time we'll be double busing it :)

Really we always always have a great time with our Buses by the Beach bus
family. We are still considering Bus Brrr - if we wimp out we'll see you all
in the Spring (if not before).

P.S. - I would ask that everyone take a look at the P.S. on the original
posting for this - it really is important to many people and you won't find
better campground owners than Tom and Joan Briggs.

Thanks,

Jeff &amp; Patty
