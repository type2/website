&gt;Rob asked:
&gt;Also has anybody else thought or gone through with 
&gt;installing the heater
&gt;somewhere else besides the engine compartment? 

Years ago I installed one in the front of a 1972 bus.
Part was inside under the passenger's feed and the
rest was under the floor, covered by the cover that is
over the pedals, etc. under the front of the bus.  No
longer have the bus, and I haven't found the pictures
that I took of the installation, but it worked well. 
The gas line from the rear was kind of long (I used
steel brake line) and I may have used a longer piece
of pipe for the exhaust from the heater. Don't recall
which model of heater it was either, but I could check
that if I get time to look around in the shed, as it
is in a box with all the other odds and ends that I've
accumulated.
Sure was nice to go out and start up the heater in the
midst of a -30 degree (F) winter and within minutes
have the ice and snow melting off the windows of the
bus.  Of course, back then I wasn't too concerned
about driving on salty roads.  Wouldn't drive the ones
I have now in those conditions.
