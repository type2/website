&gt; How to avoid this:  Clean off the brush on the inside of the paintcup

&gt; mess around, mush the bristles so that they go 90 degree angle to the
&gt; ferrule)  then just load up like the tips of the bristles (maybe last 1/2
correction to above:

by mush i mean this:
hold brush so handle is paralell to side of cup. Bristles in cup, handle
above. lever handle but keep bristles against side of cup until brush and
side of cup make close to a 90 degree angle.  All the bristles should more
or less be pointing the same way, but a bit splayed out.  Push handle
toward edge of cup, like shoving a knife into a pumpkin. the harder you
push the more paint will come out...

i hope i explained this well...

peas,

Steve
