Subject: Re: [T2] Heating with water - seeking what-if-ideas


hmmmmm.

heat is on my mind right now, I just put in a new front beam and had to
remove my entire BA4 heating system including most of the duct work to do
the job.   
 for a number of reasons the stock heating system no longer exists in any
form.  don't even have ducts or heater boxes.

  so thought

   design a replacable section of tailpipe,  one for summer one for
winter, the winter one being wrapped with copper tubing.  anti freeze mix
circulated through it to a heater core from (something) and circulation
pump,  easy expansion tube and emergency blow off valve.

  just doing some imagineering here...don't see any technical problems,
just a pain in the wazoo putting the system together,  probably just as
easy to just put the BA4 back in, at least I knew it worked and how to
make it work....it's getting cold don't have time to redesign the system,
the recycled BA4 heat system took over a year to get working right
