Michael,

You don't need a 6mm allen *wrench*, you need a 6mm allen *socket*!  Alas,
I have not seen one in 1/2&quot; drive or i'd'a bought it, but I do have a
1/2&quot;&gt;3/8&quot; adapter and the allen socket plus adapter on the Sears 24&quot; long
1/2&quot; drive flex bar will take the RIGHT off! :-)  Make sure the heads are
scrupulously clean before you start, becuase drilling out a stripped one
is a metric PITA.
