Hi -

I took my '73 bus on a small roadtrip this weekend to Wisconsin, which for 
the most part went ok.  The problem: my speedometer said I was doing around 
70 m.p.h. when I was really doing about 50m.p.h.  What the heck does that 
mean!?  I guess it's always been that way, but I had NO clue it was so far 
off.  Please help.

Thanks -
Michelle
