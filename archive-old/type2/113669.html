Subject: Re: [T2] 80 MPH Type 2

&gt;Sorry but I just gotta brag about my baby. Yesterday, I did a 2.5 hour
&gt;run at 75 to 80 MPH. My secret? (VW purists look away) I have a 2.7
&gt;liter aircooled Corvair engine and tranny transplanted in it. The engine
&gt;has been slightly modified and should produce about 150 hp. Anyone who
&gt;is planning on sinking a couple thousand on a high performance type II
&gt;or IV engine (and won't have heartburn putting American hp in their VW)
&gt;should seriously consider a Corvair engine / tranny swap. The stock
&gt;Corvair engine puts out about 110 hp (1960s defined hp, I don't know
&gt;what the difference is). Its so nice to keep up with traffic.

About another 100 years and I'll have my conversion done too. Everything is 
powdercoated, just requires assembly.

I'll be adding 15&quot; tires, swaybars, and eventually brakes. My goal isn't 
speed but accel power and stability.

Congrats Steven. I envy your bus!!!!

I had my bus up to 80-85 mph for about 50 miles one time (winter), empty 
(relatively) highways, daytime. VERY noisy and very thirsty. No harm done. 
We really needed hearing protection! &lt;grin&gt;
