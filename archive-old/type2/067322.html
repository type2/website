Subject: re: Drag coefficient &amp; buses

Bob Hoover pointed out that
&quot;The drag of the flat-plate area -- at a given speed -- becomes one factor in 
our equation.&quot; and that &quot;while .28 is pretty good it reflects only the 
coefficient of drag -- the actual drag itself is quite large.&quot;

my .02
I am currently using a vehicle operating cost model at work which is based on 
one developed by the World Bank. It estimates vehicle operating costs for 10 
different vehicle types. The VW part comes now - The utility class is based on 
a VW Kombi, which am assuming is either a single cab or double cab.It lists 
the drag coefficient as 0.46, and the frontal area as 2.72 metres squared. I 
can only guess that the drag coeff is higher because it is a ute, but one 
would expect the frontal area to be same.

So with both drag coefficient and frontal area, can we work out actual drag 
(holding air density etc etc constant) ? and what would the unit of 
measurement be?

Also in an unrelated matter, thanks to all those who replied regarding the 
accuracy of torque wrenches.
