Joe here.

Mid-repair of my 71 bus that the PO sold me as non-running 
(&quot;engine lost compression&quot;).  Been doing a lot of work on the rear 
end, and finally got to the point where I could look more closely at 
the engine.

No numbers, single port with a 28 PICT carb. (!)  I've since 
determined that the bore is 85.5mm, meaning this is probably a 
1600.  Yes?

Compression test was 0, 0, 95, and 80 lbs.  Checked this again 
after adjusting the valves and retorquing the right head - still zero.

Pulled the heads (my first time) and the only real obvious damage 
to this neophyte was that #1 exhaust valve was burned.  A clear 
gap along one segment of the outer circumference of the valve.

Pulled the cylinders, which looked good - shiny bores, no pitting.  
(This was when I determined the bore size.)

Pulled the pistons - WHOA!  #3 had one skirt broken clean off, with 
big thumbnail sized flakes of metal sitting under it in the 
crankcase.  Also found that the #3 rod has about 5mm of slop 
where it fits around the crank -- I guess this is from the unbalanced 
piston pounding out the bearing??

The other pistons looked good.  I checked the ring end gap and 
side play.  Results suggested the pistons are OK but marginal in 
the ring lands.  A couple of the rods had &gt;.016&quot; side play where 
they fit around the crank.  New rods, I guess.

No sign of any radial play in the crank bearings, but I'm assuming I 
should go ahead and split the case, at least to clean out any 
further metal shavings.  The case is apparently a universal dual-
relief case.

I want to make sure the cam, crank, and case are usable.  Local 
resources can verify the measurements for me as needed.

I have Haynes, St. Muir, and a few other references, as well as 
some been-there buddies &amp; a good repair shop locally -- plus y'all --
 so I'm going to try to do this whole thing myself.   If nothing else, it 
will be a learning experience.  I want to KNOW this engine, 
because eventually I want to do some serious cross-state camping 
(1000+ mile range) and I also want to get the AC working again, 
maybe not until next summer.

Questions:

What else should I look for on the heads?  Can I just bolt on dual 
port heads?  That would get me closer to the stock motor.

With a broken piston skirt, should I go ahead and replace all 4 
pistons and cylinders?  Mahle graphite-coated P&amp;Cs seem to be 
the preferred item.

How about the rods?

As always, thanks for the advice.  My Christmas on-the-road 
deadline may have to be pushed back now, but I'm learning a LOT! 
:-)

Joe
