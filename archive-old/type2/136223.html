Subject: Re: [T2] Solex 34mm Dual Carbs instructions wanted

joe you poor poor fellow...
i dont invy you at all . i bought the 34 mm dual solex carbs for my bus and they sent them to me with the left having a broken choke plate bushing in the top hanging out of it.
the fuel T was missing and there was no instructions for me either...
when i emailed them and ask about the missing part and missing instructions they pointed me to this link.
http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/catalog.asp?ProductID=1214
 
and this one as well
http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/images/T4-dual-solex-instructions.jpg
and that was what they sent me back out in the mail was that same sheet.
now looking at the sheet doesnt tell you much at all so good luck with that.
 
anything i can help with let me know ... everyone on here probadly remembers my awful stories of dealing with those bitches..&amp;^%*^%*^%*^%*%*&amp;^%.
 
end story cb performance doesnt take them back no refunds no exchanges of any kinds at all.
so i have a friend that wanted them that i traded them to him for a used weber 32/36 along with a rebuild kit for it.
i havent at all used the weber yet and gave the duals to him in warning and hopes that he got better luck than i out of them..
 
never again wil i do business with cbperformance though...
THEY Stink to high heaven
 
good luck bro.
i wish you better luck than i with them.
 
i have a friend jason that has them on his upright bus engine though and loves them./..
also have another friend wes that has just put some on his wifes upright beetle engine but hasnt yet installed the engine.
 
peace and love
chris

I just purchased some Solex 34mm Dual Carbs from CBPerformance and they 
provided a poor couple of paragraphs designed for a carb expert. Is there
an official instruction booklet or something similar that comes with this
product. If so, could it be found on the internet?
Cheers,
joe
