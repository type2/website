Subject: '79 ca spec timing

Jason:

I also have a '79 california spec westy with GE series engine.  Hall effect
ignition, strange driver's side heater box and with the cat mounted front
to back (instead of side to side).  My emissions engine lid sticker says 5
degrees ATDC, and that is where I have timed it for the 11 years that I
have owned it.  Are you sure you are using the right 7.5 BTDC) timing spec?

Karl?
