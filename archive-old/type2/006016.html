David-

Welcome to our lil' neighborhood. You may want to explore a membership on 
the type 2 list; the info is on the Vanagon site www.Vanagon_dot_com, as the 
folks there will know a heap more about the 1978, and will certainly know 
the motor on the 1980.

As for your window rust, yes, the windows on both come out relatively 
easily by cutting the old seals to shreds, and carefully lifting out the 
glass. On our list we have a half-dozen vendors who deal specifically in 
these bulli's, and the hungriest among them will probably have e-mailed you 
to tell you of his window seal prices. The procedure for curing the rust is 
as you can imagine, pretty straight-forward, remove all signs of rust by 
cutting/sandblasting. Weld in new metal...protect it thoroughly, paint 
it...etc.

 &lt;&lt; File: ATT00005.htm &gt;&gt; Good afternoon from a new subscriber...

We own two Westy's a 1978 and a 1980.  Both are automatics both are
air-conditioned and both have rust around parts of the window opening.
We want to semi restore them to use as daily drivers.  Before painting
them I want to remove and treat all of the rust spots...

Couple of questions;

   * are the windows difficult to remove?  Without removing them I won't
     be able to reach all of the problem areas.
   * Once the rust problem is treated and the vans are painted, will I
     be able to buy replacement window moulding ?
   * Where?
   * Will I be able to get them back in without prior experience or
     special tools?

Thank you very much...
