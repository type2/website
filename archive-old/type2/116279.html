Subject: Motor diesels when I shut it off...

Ok, well, here are some things that I noticed. I've been driving the Bus
more and more lately to get it back to full running condition. The more I
drive it, the better it runs.. BUT... I've discovered that after driving the
Bus in hot weather (like during the day), the motor will diesel when I shut
it off. It's usually no more than one turn over, but occasionally it can be
up to 5 engine rotations. What causes this, and how can I prevent it.

On the other hand though, when I drove it at night when it's cool out (the
weather is about 70 degrees outside), it runs perfect, and when I shut off
the motor, it shuts off perfectly without any dieseling. I actually just
bought a house, so the VW now has a place in the garage where it won't be
subjected to the outside elements... I'll really have some time to work on
it now.


Thanks!
