to provide the needed airflow for continuous running, the electric fans
would have to draw a lot of amps.  these amps would come from the
alternator/generator and therefore from the crankshaft.  You'd use the
same power as you would if you simply left the standard fan in place.

Now, for racing use, where you just take a blast down the strip, the
electric fans work well.  You have plenty of time to replenish the
battery between runs and there's no generator to slow the engine down.

Watercooled cars get away with using electric fans because they have
large heat exchangers (radiators) that are exposed to stagnation air
pressure at the front of the car.  The electric fans only come on when
the car is moving slowly.  OTOH, if the car is moving slowly and under
heavy load, the electric fan cannot provide enough airflow and the
engine will overheat.  I see this a lot on the infamous &quot;grapevine&quot; in
the summer months when the traffic backs up.  Lots of modern cars
steaming at the side of the road while my aircooled wonder keeps on
rolling up the hill.  I try not to feel too superior.
