Subject: Re: found leaded gas-works great!

&gt;Howdy. Out of curiosity, I went to one of the local gas stations that still
&gt;carries 87 octane leaded gas. I'm not sure why they are still allowed to
&gt;sell it, but it is the same price as 87 unleaded, so who's complaining?
&gt;What a difference! Performance was better with leaded than with 89 octane
&gt;unleaded, and it seemed to even run quieter. The dipstick was warm to the
&gt;touch after a 15 minute freeway run (it's usually hot, but not too hot to
&gt;touch). BTW, I have a 1600 dp engine from a '72 beetle. I know that these
&gt;observations are from only one day of driving, but I hope that they
&gt;continue. Is this all in my head, or could changing from unleaded to leaded
&gt;gas make such a dramatic difference? My hair seems more full and shiny, too
&gt;(just kidding).
&gt;Thanks,

Lead poisoning doesn't affect the hair so much as what's underneath it.
Mental impairment followed by insanity, and eventual death can result.
Really, lead is bad stuff to inhale.  Of course MMT, which is used here in
CANADA as a gas additive, also has certain negative effects on health. :-(

As far as I know 87 octane with lead is functionally the same as 87 octane
without lead, but less expensive to make.  If someone could shed some light
here, I would love to know for sure.

All in all we would be better off using flywheel power...
Watch for a conversion before 2010.  It might just be possible to have a
zero emissions '71 Westy, and NO BATTERIES! Imagine...:-)

Meanwhile run 'em as clean as you can and be nice to your brains.
