Subject: 34 PDSIT carb - idle mixture enrichment
Date: Sat, 10 Oct 1998 22:20:12 +1000
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

The manuals tell me that the 2&quot; x 1&quot; x 1/2&quot; box attached to the top
left of the left carb in a '76 2 litre dual carb Kombi, is an idle mixture
enricher.  Does anyone know how it works?  The manuals &amp; type2_dot_com/library
don't say.  It
has a spade connector which hasn't had a connection for as long as I have
had it.  Is it a
heater like the choke heater, operating a bimetallic strip?
If so, I guess I should attach a wire from the choke power supply or it will
idle rich.

Also there are two screws on the carby side of the idle mixture enricher,
one of which had fallen
out.  Would this have allowed air into the idle circuit?  It certainly
idles better now that I have replaced it :-)

thanks for your info...


Gavin
