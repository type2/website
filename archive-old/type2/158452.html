Subject: Re: [T2] potentiometer

 &lt;The potentiometer? How's about placing us somewhere
&gt; near to where you're thinking! Are you referring to
&gt; the airflow meter on a stock L-Jetronic FI?&gt;


is there any other on a 75 acvw?

&lt;If so, I've heard of people &quot;fiddling&quot; with the spring
&gt; adjustments and looked into that myself a few weeks
&gt; before replacing both heads and the airflow meter.
&gt; It's been a quite few years ago. I figured out that
&gt; wasn't really the way to go - about $2000 later!
&gt;
&gt; Did I guess right? -BaH&gt;



yes, you guessed right.  i'm going to get the bus from the shop tonight.  so
i guess i'll find out if they were able to adjust it back to stock.
hopefully i won't need the heads and new afm.
