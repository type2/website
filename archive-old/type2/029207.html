&gt;Air conditioning a little VW bus is about the silliest excess-baggage idea
I've seen cross
&gt;this list since I subscribed. There. I said it and I'm glad.

This is approaching a Friday subject but I want to weigh in w my 2 cents.
We just took our 78 Camper from NH to NC to camp with my folks (they have a
small Winnebago Warrior on a Toyota chassis). 2 adults, 2 kids and a dog
and lots o gear, packed solid inside and a bunch on top too. I used to
think people that needed to tow trailers behind their VW Campers were some
kind of packaholics, but I'm thinking now that would be a good idea. Used
our new side tent from eurocampers for the first time, what a GREAT
UPGRADE!!!! We actually ate dinner in our side tent w my parents every
night since their RV is fairly tight inside, but cooked in their RV (4
burner stove, double sink, exhaust fan, microwave, real oven, real fridge).

While we were at the campground a Winnebago Rialta (Class C motorhome built
on a Eurovan chassis) came in, driven by former VW Camper owners. We
admired their RV they admired our side tent. My wife and I said, boy,
someday we would like to own a Rialta. They get 16MPG in their Rialta,
while I get 19MPG in my bus (and my parents get 13MPG in their V6 Toyota
chassis).

So what IS my point anyway?

I don't drive my bus as an exercise in self-flagellation and I'm sure no
one else on this list does. It offers the best combination of economy,
utility and that special ACVW vibe that I can find. Some where out there is
a purist that would never put a non-VW side tent on their baby, rip out the
fridge guts for more room, add Pertronix ignition, put in an upgraded
stereo etc etc etc. If I could afford a $25K used Rialta I'd buy it, but I
would probably keep my VW camper too. Recently some one posted they were
getting rid of their bus because mechanical difficulties were making
driving it an exercise in self-flagellation, other people mention trying to
justify to themselves and their SOs having multiple ACVWs.

OK here's the dang conclusion... different strokes for different folks. If
someone finds the heat makes it too uncomfortable to enjoy driving in or
camping in their bus, it's better to add AC then to ditch the bus right? If
not then where do you draw the line? Nobody has flamed the corvair
conversion or Porsche 6 folks, so I think adding AC doesn't deserve being
called &quot;silliest excess-baggage idea&quot;.

And since I'm wandering a bit here check out the Corvair based UltraVan,
here is a rear engined air cooled camper that weighs about the same as a VW
Camper, but is a full motor-home.
