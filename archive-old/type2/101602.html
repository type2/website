Subject: Re: [T2] Starts and Stall then starts fine

&gt;I have a 76 with a 2.0 FI and I was wondering if any
&gt;one has had the problem:  When I first start the van
&gt;it starts for a second and then stalls.  When I start
&gt;it the second time it runs fine.  This problem started
&gt;after I had the engine out to change the clutch so I
&gt;think I might have hooked something wrong or missed
&gt;something.

Vacuum leak (injector seals, hoses, intake - search with quick shots of 
WD-40), EGR valve not right, Air flapper meter not plugged in well, the 
cold engine fast idle thingy (TM) not right (leaking vacuum).
