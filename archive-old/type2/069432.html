Double check that your thermostat pulley mounting bolt is there.  If it
isn't, a very fine mist of oil will be sprayed out of it when the motor is
revved.  Yes, the freaking bolt hole goes directly into the crankcase!  I
admit it's more likely that it is your valve cover, but I thought it was
worth mentioning.
