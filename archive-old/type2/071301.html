Subject: Re: end float and rocker troubles, Thanks all
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Thanks all for the help with these two &quot;problems&quot;. Both turned out to be 
minor, though it didn't seem that way to bryce and me after our engine 
assembly session yesterday :-)

It turns out that I didn't wait until the flywheel was on to worry about end 
float. I'll check it today, but I feel that it will be good after the 
flywheel is on.

As for the rocker problem; again, no problem, really. The pushrods on that 
sylinder have a tendency to get caught on the edge of the lifter &quot;cups&quot;. 
Pulling the rocker shafts to have a close look, and a careful reassembly put 
it in order.

We are on our way again.

Thanks again/Don Carron and Bryce
