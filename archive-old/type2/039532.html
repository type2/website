Subject: FOR SALE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE- 1973 WESTY

Hey Folks-
    I didn't get the response I expected, so I'm selling the bus for
$1,100.00 firm. This bus is NOT a daily driver, it needs loose ends tied
up before she can travel. It has a very fresh 1800 cc engine &amp; re-man
(supposed) transmission. I just rebuilt the engine over the winter &amp;
haven't driven it more than 5 miles. The bus runs excellent. Please
contact me off list for further info. Thanks.
Carl
