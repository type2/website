Subject: Re: [T2] Just got a no seatbelt ticket... has there been a
  study done saying that belts in a bus would do nothing to prevent
  injury?

&gt; Hey folks,
&gt; Yep, just got pulled over. The anti Bush jokes on the
&gt; bumper musta rubbed a raw nerve in someone.

Don't forget your VW says that you're anti-Nader which greatly increases
your chance of getting pulled over by &quot;that&quot; cop. ;-)

&gt; I was ticketed for going 44 in a 35 and for not
&gt; wearing a seatbelt. Speeding I can go along with but
&gt; the seatbelt is a joke to me. For one I have Nissan
&gt; seats in my bus which are higher than the stock ones
&gt; and make it hard to shift. Adding a seatbelt to that
&gt; would restrict my shoulder movement and make shifting
&gt; all but impossible. Just wondering if there is any
&gt; hard evidence out there showing the value of wearing a
&gt; seatbelt in a '78 T2.

Get a shifter extension or swap the old seat back, please.

&gt; It seems logical to me that if
&gt; your already, as Muir put it, strapped like an Aztec
&gt; sacrifice to the front of the bus, that you would have
&gt; no where to go in the event of a collision. I may be
&gt; wrong. 

Here's some food for thought, you are the crumple zone:

I recall reading a VW history book that stated that VW took offense to
Nader's comments toward VWs in the last 60's and early 70's and crash tested
the bay window. VW reported that there were no incursions into the cabin up
to 30mph.  Saying it was safer than the split wasn't saying much.

Safety standards have gone way beyond the design of these vehicles and I
think it's difficult to rationalize safety decisions.
