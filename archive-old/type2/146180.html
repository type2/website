Subject: 82 Torque Converter Scraping Noise

When I purchased my 82 Vanagon last july every so often I would hear an 
intermittent  scraping noise coming from the engine area and tightened the muffler 
bracket and would only hear the noise when it was cold and then every so often 
when the engine torqued or was at idle while in gear.   Yesterday I replaced 
the left exhaust header that had a crack in it and the Wrench said that the 
noise was coming from the Torque Converter in the auto tranny.  Now have 160k 
miles on her and it has been 5k since tranny servicing.  All seems fine except 
the intermittent little tiny scraping noise now and then.

At 122k miles the previous owners had the tranny rebuilt will $800 in parts 
including a new Torque converter.  2k later the torque converter and front 
seals were replaced and at 150k the flywheel was replaced.  

Wondering how long before failure and if I need to just find a different 
tranny...This one seems so smooth but obviously she is going to self destruct at 
some point.

Chuck
