Hi everyone. I've been a VW owner for over 15 years. My first VW was a 1962
Beetle.  I now own a 1972 Camp-mobile.  This &quot;new&quot; VW is in need of repair
but it runs, is licensed for the road (not only marking it's spot, it marks
everything), and is almost complete interior.

My request is finding a good air-cooled VW mechanic in the Durham/Raleigh
area of NC.  It would also help for a good supplier of new and rebuilt parts
in the area.  I'm new to the area so I haven't found a mechanic yet.  Need
to find someone soon to help correct the bad oil leak. Thanks

Dave
