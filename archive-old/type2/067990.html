&gt;Don't let oil, degreasers, etc go down the storm drain or on the ground.
&gt;In most places in the US, it will go, completely untreated, into the
&gt;nearest river, lake, or bay. 

Not to mention contaminating your own ground. A fellow about a mile away 
from me lives in a very nice house built where an auto junkyard used to be 
from the 1950's through 70's.  He has well water, because in this area 
there is no public sewer hookup. Water testing or no water testing, I don't 
think I'd want to be drinking untreated water from the ground beneath a 
former junkyard.  Oil, antifreeze, and the like can contaminate your 
groundwater for a very long time.

A local German VW mechanic I know uses a waste oil heater to heat his 
garage.  It works out great.  My used motor oil becomes his free heating 
oil.
