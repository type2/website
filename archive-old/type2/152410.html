Subject: Re: [T2] Timing light

Jerry,
Without advance : light comes on when spark happens. To time you need
a mark on the pulley at the timing required (e.g. around 30deg BTDC
for a 009 at full advance).
With advance : user dials in advance or retard on the timing light. To
time you align TDC with the case split at the specified rpm with the
advance/retard you dialed.

If you are able to cut a piece of cardboard with a X degree angle and
apply it properly on the pulley to mark the timing point or compute
which fraction of the circumference of the pulley you need to achieve
X degrees then you do not need advance timing light. For sure a pro
who times 12 engines a day wants a light with advance. The pro does
not want to spend the time marking those 12 pulleys every day.

I had bought a kit with timing light + remote starter + compression
gauge + fuel pressure gauge + multimeter for 40$
