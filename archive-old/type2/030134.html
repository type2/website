&gt; First time in my life, I am setting my points.
&gt; 
&gt; They were reading 61.5 at 950 rpm on a digital dwell/tach meter.
&gt; 
&gt; I opened them up.
&gt; 
&gt; Now they are reading 26.5 at 1320 rpm.
&gt; 
&gt; The Westy sound better then it ever did, running faster with just a new 
&gt; point setting.
&gt; 
&gt; Question:  should I leave them at 21.5 or will I have problems as soon as I 
&gt; take it on the road. (Now in the garage, waiting to hear the bad things that 
&gt; will happen at the low dwell reading....)

What has happend is that adjusting your points also changed your timing so
the engine idles faster.  This doesn't mean that what you did to the
points is good though!

Think of it this way:  A dwell of 45-50 degrees is good for the health of
your ignition system.  If the dwell is too large or too small the ignition
system will have a hard time producing a healthy spark.

After you set the dwell, you have to go back and set the timing, as it
will now be different due to the change in the points.

BTW, the only accurate way I've found to adjust the points is by dwell.
Even with brand new points, I've never been able to adjust the gap with a
feeler guage and have the dwell be right.  I always end up readjusting the
points to correct the dwell.  Bosch doesn't make  it easy to adjust the
points either, since you have to open the distributor and remove the dust
cover and rotor just to get at the things.  Then you have to move them
just a leetle bit, button up, start engine, take reading, repeat.

Compare this to my Ch*vy where I start engine, put allen wrench through
hole to points, turn allen wrench until dwell is right, and that's it!

Once set, the VW points seem to hold their settings very well.  They just
aren't the most convenient to set!

I'm aware of the &quot;pointless&quot; alternative, but I'd rather work with a devil
I know.  I tried the Pertronix modules on a motorcycle once and I wasn't
impressed.
