Hey Y'all,
  I had a major brain dump, I forgot to include the location. I am in
Graham near Tacoma. I am very motivated to sell it I need the room and
if my wife finds out I got another bus before I sell this one I will
need it to live in. My # is (253)-846-2004 call in the evenings if your
interested.
