Hot Tip #1: Most tach/dwell meters have scales that are set for either 6
cylinder or 8 cylinder cars. It is VERY, VERY important to remember that
a Volkswagen bus only has FOUR CYLINDERS.

Only an anacephalic dilettante would try timing his FOUR CYLINDER engine
using the eight cylinder scale. He might have set his dwell properly,
dividing the eight cylinder scale in half for a dwell angle of 25
degrees, plus or minus two.

But then this stoneware-for-brains shadetree mechanic goes ahead and
tries setting the spark at 975 RPM (actually 1,950 RPM).  He might think
to himself &quot;my that sounds mighty fast for 1000 RPM.&quot; He might wonder
why he can't adjust the idle speed screw to maintain this setting. He
might panic and send memos to the Type 2 list, puzzled by the fact that
his EGR valve is opening at low (actually 2000 RPM) idle.

*****

On another note, my bus is running much smoother now. I set the spark at
5* BTDC for the time being (dizzy # 022 905 205S on a 74 1800 MT), will
try 7.5* if I get ambitious. Oh yes, that's at 975 RPM which, on an 8
cylinder scale, is just under the 500 mark.
