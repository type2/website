Subject: Re: [T2] popping, and repair shop

Various diagnostics:

a) pull a spark plug, what story does it tell?  Rich/Lean?

b) while the bus is running, pull off each spark plug wire 
	(one at a time) and listen to see if the engine runs
	different?  Yes?  Good.  No?  Then you may have a spark
	plug gap or wire problem.  Reconnect that wire and move 
	to the next one...

c) Recheck dwell/point-gap.  Points move and/or get oxidized and
	it can happen after just a few miles.

d) Fuel filters: 
	i) are they plastic or the glass, cleanable ones?
	   in my opinion, the plastic, disposable ones are better
	   and stop more junk.  They are also lighter and don't
	   drag on your fuel line.
	ii) are the filters zip-tied in place or just freely moving?
	    i've had issues where a fuel filter would bob up and down,
	    cutting off my fuel flow enough to stall me out while running
	    down the highway at speed.  Get 'em held into place.

e) fuel pressure (as jason mentioned)

f) float valve in your carb
	i) this can get clogged and stuck in the &quot;open&quot; position and
		you'll run rich, stall out, etc.
	ii) pull the top off the carb and manually check if the float
		valve works as per Muir/Bentley (I think they have a 
		proceedure)

g) idle cut-off valve
	i) when the key is turned to the &quot;on&quot; position, do you hear a 
		click?
	ii) if you can, unscrew the idle cut-off solenoid and connect
		it to 12V to see if it acutates properly.  I've had ones 
		that would &quot;stick&quot; and cause my bus not to idle.

h) vacuum:  how much vacuum do you have off the manifold?  Should be at 
	least 15+ (cm3, IIRC (probably not))

Etc.  

It could also be a coil going, but it sounds fuel related.
