Subject: CV boot clamps

Executive summary:

     I suck

Condition:

     While repacking the CVs (for the first time), I
cleverly left off the boot clamps before reassembly
and greasing, thus utilizing my God given gift of
screwing myself over.

Is there a type of clamp I can get that can be installed
post facto? Can I use a heavy duty cable tie?
