&gt;I let the engine run today and everything is normal.

Yay.

&gt;My clutch cable seems long. The wing nut is maxed out (new cluch). Can they 
&gt;strech this much? I've had this issue on other busses in the past. I am 
&gt;going to get a new one and see what happens.

I think a new cable leaves about 1/2&quot; of adjustment which I think is a lot to run out of without any visible signs of cable fatigue...

&gt;I do plan on adjusting the valves (1 turn) soon and resetting the timing. So 
&gt;far I think I got all the oil leaks except one valve cover gasket that I 
&gt;will get when I do the valves.

I've been using Hylomar (Permatex #25249) that George Lyle recommended to me. Bone dry (with old valve covers and cork gaskets) after thousands of miles up until I stopped driving it a few weeks ago for unrelated issues.
