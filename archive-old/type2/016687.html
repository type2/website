I have finally entered the type 2 list today with a purchase of a 72'
camper.  I is owned by a friend of mine here in Atlanta.  She was
thinking about selling it and finally decided upon it.  It is in really
nice shape, she says that it is running almost perfect.  I am going to
pick it up from her friday.  Now my vw thing will have someone else to
talk to while I work. 

Very excited,
