  You can't beat this deal. I cannot buy them wholesale this cheap. All the new single port heads come from tha same 
factory as only one place makes them. I do not know how the quality is of these heads but do know that the class 1/2 
1600 racers won't use them. SCORE has changed the rules for next year allowing the use of duel port heads due to 
the lack of GOOD single port heads now.

&gt;I know that they are no longer being made, but does anyone have a line 
&gt;on rebuilt or new SP heads?  
&gt;
&gt;Or know of a reputable rebuilder in the Baltimore/Washington/Philly area?
&gt;
&gt;I just determined that my &quot;good&quot; heads need quite a bit more work than I'm 
&gt;ready for at the moment (and one of them might be cracked) and I'm looking 
&gt;at my options.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
