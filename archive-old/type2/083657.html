&gt; My question is, Kurt and the guys at vintage
&gt; performance say that the suggested specs for
&gt; the distributor is way to hot for my new AVP
&gt; type IV engine.  Aircooled_dot_net said to time the
&gt; engine to 7.5 before at idle, 32 degrees
&gt; advance with vaccum disconnected and 42-45
&gt; connected.  Is this right?

Ronnie at aircooled_dot_net is right.  Your mechanics
are thinking of a type 1 engine, which I'm told,
shouldn't have more than 30 degrees total
advance.  The type IV comes stock with much more,
like around 40-45 degrees.  

Here's the link:

Here are the stats for your stock dizzy:
Bus &amp; Pickup 1972 * 1700 
Distributor: VW 021-905-205E, Bosch 0231 173 005
Timing Set At:: 5deg ATDC _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe,
vacuum hose(s) connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8-12deg Adv,
11-15deg Ret; Centrifugal: 13-16deg _at_ 2000rpm,
23-26deg _at_ 3600 rpm 

And here is the stat for the &quot;SVDA&quot;:
Bus &amp; Pickup Late 1976-1978 All States, 1979
Federal * 2000 
Distributor: VW 021-905-205P, Bosch 0231 168 005
022-905-205S, 0231 170 093
Timing Set At:: 7.5deg BTDC _at_ 850-950 rpm (Man
Trans), 900-1000 rpm (Auto Trans) w/strobe,
vacumm hose connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 8.5-11deg Adv _at_ 7.9
In. Hg; Centrifugal: 8-13deg _at_ 1600 rpm,
20.5-24.5 _at_ 3400 rpm 

I got the years wrong on the SVDA.  It is 76-79.

Let me see if I can compare these and make it
make sense to you.  (It is really easy to
understand once you have the timing chart, a
strobe, and a vacuum guage.)  

Your stock dizzy was set at 5 ATDC.  When you hit
the throttle, you instantly lose the retard
(11-15 degrees).  This puts you at 6-10 BTDC. 
Look familiar?  If you capped the retard on a
dual vac dual advance dizzy, 6-10 BTDC should be
your timing at idle.  This should look alot like
a single vac dual advance dizzy, right?  See that
the 76 is timed at around 8 BTDC.  

As you rev your engine and hold vacuum on it,
either of the dual action dizzies (a 72 DVDA or a
76 SVDA) will give you 8-12 vacuum advance and
around 25 centrifugal (the 72 DVDA a little more
than the 76 SVDA), for a total of around 43
degrees advance (8 BTDC + 10 vac advance + 25
cent advance).  

I hope this makes sense.
