Subject: Re: [T2] Valve questions.........

Hey Chris, I would love it if that was the case!  I did just a major  
engine/tranny swap between 3 buses, 2 of them good, one a donor.  Anyway I  did have 
to remove the carbs to get the engine out, and the sound did start  after I 
had gotten the engine back in and running.
 
I will check that out on Sunday and let you know.
 
THANK YOU for the suggestion!  I really hope that is what it is!!! 
 
&quot;&quot;fingers crossed!&quot;&quot;
 
~Jeremy
