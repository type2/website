&gt; It got me thinking... If more people drove Volkswagen transporters,

&gt; learn
&gt; to deal with it, and relax. You know you probably won't make that stop

Heh, your post is timely.  Just last night, while walking home from 
seeing a movie with some friends, my wife and I passed by a '71 Beetle 
parked on 4th Ave.  It was in great shape from a distance, so I said 
&quot;hey, let's go take a look at it...&quot;

We peered over it, and all the fond memories of the '72 Super Beetle I 
had when I was in high school passed through my mind... and as we 
continued on towards our house, I said &quot;Y'know, the world would be a 
better place if everyone drove an old Volkswagen... besides how 
absolutely adorable they are, they would give everyone a greater sense 
of patience, at the very least...&quot; :-)
