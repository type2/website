Subject: Wonderlust!!!!!   Or My Story:

Say Jim, do you want some company? Just wishing, really sounds like a good
idea today.

    I agree with Bob, except on year models. I would keep it to the 1968 to
1971 models, the 71 being the most appealing, IMHO because of the front disk
brakes. There are several other reasons for chousing the 68 thru 71 years.
I'll list a few, again IMHO:

Disk brakes, stronger, straighter fade free stops.

1600 engine, cheap, reliable, ease to work on, parts availability almost any
where, &quot;enough power&quot;, but not a race winner in a bus of course. Leave early,
drive slow, and enjoy the ride! A New Mexican engine is available with HYD
lifter, and oil filter in the $1200.00 range. This will extend your
maintenance range somewhat, and eliminate valve adjustments. Sold out right is
a plus also (no exchange needed). If you intend to build your own, start with
a new case, rebuilt crankshaft, have your heads rebuilt by a good shop using
new exhaust valves and guides. When the dust settles, you wont save much money
building your own, but you will have the satisfaction!

Transmission: Bull Dog Tough, you just cant kill one with out abusing it (lack
of oil, running it in water, etc)

&quot;NO&quot; gear reduction boxes, last made in 1967. Personally I like the look of
the &quot;Splittys&quot; better, but I just don't care for the way they drive compared
to the 68 thru 71's.

Front end: Ball joints much softer ride, more precise &quot;Feel of the road&quot;,
easier to work on. There is a tendency for rust damage on the tubes, but if
there isn't any at the time you buy, its easy to prevent with paint, rust
proofing, etc.

    Now this is where I differ from Bob. I would go with the most simple
design I could get. Excluding the afore mentioned 1967 and earlier models. Why
take a chance with expensive thirty year old fuel injection components, plus
the 1700 thru 2000 cc engines are very expensive, and can be trouble some.
Plus they don't lend them selves to road side repair compared to a non fuel
injection 1600.

Cost: You can expect to pay some where between $500.00 for a re-builder, to
$5000.00 for a slick bus. I would try and find a bus that is running and in
use. This will eliminate a lot of potential ills, compared to one that has
been sitting for a long time.Check it out for rust damage, make sure the
transmission is in good shape.
    You may want to figure on a brake rebuild, including on new flex hoses,
master cylinder, etc.
    You can see a lot of the wiring harness on a bus. Check for burnt wires,
corrosion in the fuse box, water damage from leaking windshield, wiper area.

    Buy as you would any used car, have it looked at by an experienced
Volkswagen shop, and remember:

NEVER BUY AT NIGHT........NEVER BUY IN THE RAIN........... NEVER BUY (OR SELL
FOR THAT MATTER) FROM FAMILY.............REMEMBER YOU CAN WALK AWAY, ITS NOT
THE ONLY ONE LEFT.........and the main
one......................................................
...............................LET THE BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    Good luck, keep us posted on the bus. And for all us Lesser men, Wife
bound Yes Dear types, bills up the Kazoo, a running account of the trip would
be fun!

Have fun,
