Subject: Re: [T2] Upright Alternator Endplay

Faster,

never heard of that one...might check the rear nut to make sure it is 
not coming loose.

Sure it's the shaft rather than the pulley?

I recently had a &quot;new&quot; rebuilt one on a T1 engine that started making a 
lot of noise...turns out the keyway for the pulley was shot...didn't hurt 
the pulley, but sure did make the keyway look bad.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Just recently the 1600 in my 66 seems a bit louder. I tracked down the
&gt; sound to the alternator shaft moving in/out a bit. This engine has an
&gt; alternator conversion kit on it w/ a Bosch alt. Does anyone know of a
&gt; way of adjustment, or if the unit is simply shot?
