&gt; or maybe you didn't set your endplay correctly the first time :p

...that's how it's starting to appear  :)


&gt; When you rebuilt the engine, did you use
&gt; assembly lube when you put it together?

yes.


&gt; did you put in new bearings?

yes.


&gt; Did you have the crank ground and/or checked before reassembly w/
&gt; properly sized oversized bearings?

The crank was in great shape...just polished it so it only needed std bearings 
(my dad works as a machinist and grinds cranks for a living).
