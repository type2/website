Subject: Re: [T2] read side marker light source?

EMPI does not make them.  They are manufactured in India by the same company
that makes the lenses and supplies to just about everyone in the aftermarket
these days.  I've installed several of these bulbholders (last ones on a
friend's 76 Bay a year ago) and have had similar problems Andy &amp;
Jon describes, but didn't have to resort to bolting them in. But like they
say YMMV.  The snap in clips could be better.  VWG looked into tooling
better ones, but almost $30K in tooling + 10,000 piece minimum
order scrapped that idea - you'd never see a return on it (or it would
take 10 years to recoup in the best case scenario).  Can't make everything
:-(

Hella discontinued these many years ago and at last report, trashed the
tooling.  Every rumor I've followed up on regarding the re-intro of new
Hella production has been a dead end so far.  The plastic on the Hella units
IMHO was a bit more pliable and did clip in the holes better.

&gt; EMPI makes them out of Asia somewhere.
&gt; I just did this on my '70 Deluxe and ended up drilling out the crappy tabs
&gt; and using some stainless bolts. They don't fit right, but it was my only
&gt; choice since the originals were beyond help. I am on the lookout for some
&gt; quality replacement units.
&gt; I heard somewhere that Hella is making them again. Anybody got info on
&gt; that?
