Subject: RE: [T2] 2.0L in a '70???

I used =B472 as an example because over here in Europe it could be had =
with
either the 1600 or an optional dual carbed 1700. Having had 2 =
different=B472
busses with both versions (originally installed as stock) and looking =
at the
mounting setup/rear apron and what not, I didn't see any major show =
stopping
differences.

And I still don't see why you'd need to reconfigure a stock 2.0 T4 to =
an
upright to install it. (But on the other hand, I sure wish I could pull =
my
motor without jacking the bus!)

Regards,

John B.

&gt; A 1970 used a different tranny mounting and a 1600=20
&gt; engine.......the mounting
&gt; setup is completely different.  Rear apron of bus is removed,=20
&gt; and you do not
&gt; need to jack up the bus to pull the motor!  Moustache bar=20
&gt; with motor mounts
&gt; on the end that goes to the frame.
&gt;=20
&gt; In your case the mounting between a 2liter and your 1700 is=20
&gt; exactly the
&gt; same........Longer moustache bars with mounts attached near center.

&gt; &gt; Saw this one and have to ask:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Why? What is the major difference(s) between the '70 and=20
&gt; say '72 setups?
&gt; My
&gt; &gt; previous '72 had the 1700 T4 installed and it looked like a=20
&gt; 2.0 would
&gt; &gt; shoehorn in there O.K..... Why convert to an upright? I can=20
&gt; imagine there
&gt; &gt; may be some frame clearance related issues on the sides but???
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Enquiring minds want to know....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks and take care,

&gt; &gt; &gt;The engine will not fit without converting it to upright,=20
&gt; and fabricating
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt;new type of Mustache bar for the application..Of all the=20
&gt; vehicles A T IV
&gt; &gt; can
&gt; &gt; &gt;be installed into, this one is the roughest.
