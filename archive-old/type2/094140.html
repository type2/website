&gt; It would be nice to find a set of fittings that would screw directly on
&gt; the output nipple, have a valve and metric diameter output.

I had one of these on my bus for many years and it was very handy when my
tank was all rusted out because there were days I had to stop twice to clean
the filter.

However, the plumbing variety does not hold up over time: the seal in the
middle won't last against gasoline/air and eventually you'll need something
to cut-off the &quot;cut-off&quot;.

Frankly, with the tank almost empty and a large low profile bucket
underneath like a tray for bussing ;-) dishes and wearing rubber gloves,
changing the fuel filter without a cut off isn't that messy.  In fact, I've
done it without any lingering gasoline smell many times.

To the original poster: if rust is your problem, know that the rust will
form a thin sheath on the inside of the fuel lines over time which builds up
and breaks off in chunks on its way to your new filter.

I think it's a good idea to give your fuel lines from the filter to the tank
a little squeeze along the entire length of it where it's not metal line and
run the engine for a little while to let the old filter catch these flakes
first this since you are throwing it out anyway.
