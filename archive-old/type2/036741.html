Subject: Oh, happy day!

Today I got the check from the insurance company for the damage done to
Wendelin's nose by the deer back in October -- $1819.73. (The delay was
my fault -- months of phone tag, low priority with my dad's illness).

Now I just have to decide whether to get a donor nose or order a new
nose skin. Oh, decisions, decisions....

Question for anyone who's had a new nose skin installed: how did the
ductwork under the dash get handled? Welded back on or just left off?
That's a big concern in the decision of donor vs. new.
