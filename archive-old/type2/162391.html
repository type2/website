&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I have a 2L '77 bus. There is some one wrecking a '82 (T3) high top camper not far
&gt; from me.
&gt;
&gt; I was wondering whether the motor and transmission (manual) are interchangable?
&gt; I have never had a T3, so don't know how different thay are, especially the trans.
&gt; I am aware the T3 motor will have different EFI and exhaust (square exhaust
&gt; ports), and tinware, but is the rest the same?

nothing similar, the 2liter bus engine tranny is based on the T4 engine. I
have swapped a T4 engine into a bus.   also the Porsche 914/4 is basically
the same engine turned around.

the T3 engine is a fancied up T1 engine
