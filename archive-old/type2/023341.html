If the clock was standard on Champagne Editions then I got ripped off 
somewhere along the way because I have the brown dash Champagne Edition 
(Cow Poop Edition) and no clock.

Wonder if I can complain to the dealer about this? &lt;grin&gt;

I can complain but maybe the real question is whether they would give a damn!

So my question is - did ALL Champagne Editions get clocks? I've got a '78 
Westy.



&gt;The clock in the dash was optional.
&gt;It was standard on Champagne Editions.
