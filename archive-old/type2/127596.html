&gt; Ahh, now THAT'S the type of golden nugget of info I've been waiting
&gt; for. I didn't realize they were adjustable! 

they aren't :( But if installed incorrectly it causes some problems in
the orientation of the distributor. 

&gt; The Dist. Drive Gear is the the little one on the bottom of the
&gt; Dist. Shaft right? Yay, off to the Archives to see what I can find
&gt; on Dist. Drive Gears. :)

phil already mentioned this. unfortunately it's not that easy. Plus
make sure you have the correct TDC for #1. It's the point where the #1
cyl (yes the one you described is correct) is at it's highest point on
the stroke the spark plug files. If you roll it to #1 TDC and roll the
crank back/forth the valves should not even attempt to move, if to
just rotate the crank another 360 and you will be a happy person.
