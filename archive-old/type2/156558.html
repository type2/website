Subject: RE: [T2] CHT gauge testing

&gt; mount my CHT at plug #3--and it tells me a
&gt; LOT--about the temp at plug #3.
&gt; 
&gt; if the engine is running smooth and even and the
&gt; valves are set right, I 
&gt; can tell how hard to charge up a mountain by
&gt; monitoring the head temp at 
&gt; #3, if it goes much above 450F I back off the
&gt; throttle.

Very well put. That is EXACTLY what to use a single
CHT gauge for. Ask most people what they buy one for
or what they buy an oil temp gauge for and they'll
reply that they bought it so they can catch a problem
as it develops and before it turns major.

My agenda is to inform people that a single CHT won't
do that for them - it will do precisely what you use
it for - as long as you adhere &quot;loosely&quot; to the 450
deg rule because it can read 350 and be 450 if the
engine compartment is hot enough.

I have always bad-talked oil temp gauges for T4
motors, also, saying that all it is good for on a T4
is to tell you that you toasted your engine ten miles
ago. Few people know that my last T-4 motor failed due
to a badly damaged bottom end and the oil temp gauge
might have saved me - but the QUAD CHT gauge told me
nothing! As it was, the engine was tough enough to
make it another 1000 miles after spinning the center
main bearing.

Thank you for replying. Few people have climbed
onboard this discussion but everyone who does helps us
all with another point of view. -BaH
