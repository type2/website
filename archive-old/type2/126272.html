&gt;1: My brake lights don't come on without they key in the Run position.
&gt;Is that normal? 

Yes.

&gt;2: On the bottom of the fuse box their are three boxes. They look like
&gt;relay boxes. What are these to? Is one the blinker thingie? 

Headlight dimmer relay, emergency flasher relay and door buzzer.

&gt;3: What all lights are supposed to be ON on the dash when the key is in
&gt;the run position but while it's not running? 

I hope I remember this right...everything should be on. When the headlight switch is pulled fully out and you move the key from on to off the headlights go off but everything else stays on (same as first position of headlight switch).

&gt;4: Why does stuff take SOOOooo long coming from the East Coat,

Lewis and Clark figured that out already.

&gt;and on
&gt;that note, why doesn't BusDepot have a west coat branch? :) 

Now that would be cool.

&gt;5: Why am I finding myself NOT wanting to go and get the gas gauge
&gt;working in my bus?

You are a free spirit and running out of gas makes the trip more enjoyable that driving by the gauge. :)
