Subject: new job, 50 MILE commute to work, NEED ADVICE!!!!!

mornin dubers,

    ok here's the deal, I just got an AWESOME new job but its 50 miles away
(40 highway, 10 city)
My '78 bus, is loven the high way miles, not to mention all the attention
she gets... ;)
I've picked up some gauges to help me &quot;keep my fingers on her pulse&quot; but now
that I have them I realize that I have no bases for what the numbers
mean.....
the gauges I have are:

autometer oil temp / using a VDO dipstick sender
VDO volt meter
Stewart Warner amps gauge
VDO oil pressure (not in yet, waiting on sender)
Sun Super Tach II Mini - Model #CP7908 8k RPM (not  in yet)
biding on an autometer cylinder head temp gauge

so the question is:
what are Ideal readings
and what are the oh S*%$ readings????

Thanks in advance

Mike LaBarge
