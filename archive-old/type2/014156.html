Subject: Engine races when brakes applied

Hello and Happy Monday:

I finally got my new engine installed into my 71 bus, and everything is going OK, but the one big problem I'd like to solve is that my engine races when I apply the brakes.  Some details:  1600DP with dual Kadrons, vacuum assist disc brakes.  I synched the carbs, but maybe they're not set at the right mixture level???  The problem gets worse when the engine is fully warmed up.  Also, I have a VDO tach, and it doesn't seem to be reading correctly at low RPM, like at idle.  The engine sounds about right, but the tach is reading between 2000-3000 RPM.  Anyone have any clues?

Thanks!

Jim Hood
