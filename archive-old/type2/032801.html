Yeah, its a heat vent for the cargo area.  There used to be a big black scoop
looking thing sticking out of it to direct the air under the middle seat when
the bus was a Kombi.

I'll be camperizing my Kombi as well and will cutting holes in the flooring to
accomodate the vent.  I will be manufacturing either an aluminum or steel
'grate' or 'screen' to go over it so large objects do not drop in and clog the
heat tube.  

I have thought of a small 'dome' - similar to the little local water inlet
cover on the outside of westfalias - you know - the one that has the 'westy
horse' molded into the plastic?
I'd like to make a model of that dome in steel and maybe use it to cover the
vent.

If you close the little flap that should be over it, it shouldn't be a big
deal with the flooring over it - your passengers will just be colder -MAYBE
you'll get a little more pressure/heat flow up front.  

If the little flap isn't there - use something made of steel to cover it so if
your heat ever works, you won't (as if!) cook your flooring or cause a fire
hazard. With VW heat?   Right - but just in case...
