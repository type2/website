Subject: Re: [T2] engine install questions

You have to get really creative when installing them.  I think I used a jack 
to increase the clearance then lowered it once they were tightened(the 
clamps).

&gt;Well, just finished installing the motor in my bus.  It is a 69.  In 
&gt;installing the mustache bar, I noticed that my muffler clamps sit right on 
&gt;it.  There is no clearance to take the clamps off or tighten them.  Never 
&gt;noticed this before, course I had a 67.  Is this normal?  Get more from the 
&gt;Web.  FREE MSN Explorer download : http://explorer.msn_dot_com
