Subject: Antique Tags, Vacuum Leak?

Hello Everyone,
        Still working on the motor in my bus, I think I have a vacuum
leak. When I start the motor the first time it will not pull out without
dying (automatic). Once you get it to move then it is good for the rest
of the day. Any suggestions would be appreciated, I don't have a vacuum
meter. Also has anyone used antique tags and what are the pros and cons.
Thanks

 Ralph 78 Westy
