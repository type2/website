Subject: Re: [T2] OTP - Century welders homepage??

In a message dated 1/11/04 3:13:10 PM, courtneyhook_at_shaw_dot_ca writes:

&lt;&lt; OK I've surfed all over the *(*%&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;!!! internet and I cannot find a

homepage for Century welders or battery chargers. Does anyone know of a

1-800 no. or a homepage for these guys? I would appreciate it, as I have

purchased a Century quick-fix mig welder but have no manual.


Many thanks,


Courtney &gt;&gt;
