Subject: Re: [T2] Annapolis MD Mechanic/Body Work Needed

&gt; After 2 years of doing just enough to keep the bus &quot;running&quot; (and I

&gt;
&gt; So, here I am, recently relocated to Annapolis MD looking for leads
&gt; on mechanics and body repair shops.   I have 2 young kids and a ton
&gt; of other things going on so although I would like to do some of the
&gt; work myself I'm going to take advantage of the budget appropriation
&gt; and let someone else actually complete the work.
&gt;
&gt; All leads in Anne Arundel or surrounding counties welcome.  I'm
&gt; comfortable taking it 30-45 miles if needed.

Peek Automotive in Lanham is pretty good and a tad pricy but they do good
work..
also in Baltimore there is a guy at Old Harford and Taylor ave that works
on all but auto trannys he has a good reputation but his name escapes me
at the moment.

there is a guy in Glen Burnie/and on Fort Smallwood rd (Same guy) stay as
far away as possible, he is a rip off and can't fix anything newer than a
1960.

on the other side is Rick's in Dundalk and a place that is good but
expensive down on the Eastern Shore will give you more info on those if
you want to go that far.

welcome to the neighborhood.
