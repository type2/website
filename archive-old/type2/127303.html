&gt; The instructions that John (aircooled_dot_net) e-mailed me about the SVDA

&gt; &quot;To verify the correct operation of the SVDA, the timing should be
&gt; 
&gt; A) 7.5 at idle
&gt; B) 32 Total Advance (hose disconnected)_at_ 3500 RPM.
&gt; C) 42-45 Total Advance (hose connected)_at_ 3500 RPM.
&gt; 
&gt; If the A and B timing settings vary, go with the B setting (at 3500 RPM) 
&gt; to set your timing. Full centrifugal advance is more important then the 
&gt; idle timing.&quot;

wow I never got anything written when I got mine (feeling left out
now).  You mentioned in the past post that you set it to 38 was that
w/ vacuum or w/out, cause that doesn't fit inside any of the number
given.

&gt; By &quot;AFM&quot; I meant air-fuel mixture -- tweaking the mixture screws on the 
&gt; carbs. Sorry -- did I use &quot;AFM&quot; incorrectly?

no. just poking at you, althoug AFM is usually used to indicate a
Air Flow Meter in FI systems.
 
&gt; I could use a pointer to a bunch of pictures of what spark plugs should 
&gt; look like when the mixture is correct. Is there such a thing on the web?

I have found one somewhere, but if it's running rich the plugs will be
black w/ soot. Do a google search for plug color or something like
that
