&gt; I am starting to get my new project going (78 westy 2.0) and I need a gas tank

&gt; so if anyone out there has a tank for me or knows where i can get one please
&gt; let me know.

The local wrecking yard has several late bay tanks still in the busses
behind the firewalls:

Busted Bus once gave me the name of a place in Arizona or Kansas (I forget)
that has gas tanks but I can't find the information.  Ask them...
