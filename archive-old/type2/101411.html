Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Flow/MPG Meter?

Mike,

You can probably really do it, but you are going to need a small
computer and some hardware and software skills.

Just my idea....hook in to one of the injectors(sensing only) and
start recording injector opening times.  Multiply by 4 based
on how much the injector flows at the standard fuel pressure(when not 
idling) and it's all math from there.

Sounds like a lot of work just for mpg though!

The problem with the delivery sensors is that they are generally 
expensive.....but....have one on the delivery side and one on the
return tank side and just subtract return from delivered.

http://www.measureanything_dot_com/catalogs/flow/catalog_flow_fuel.asp

just for fun....at $$$$$400 for a pair, and they call these &quot;low-cost&quot;!

James can have anything cause he doesn't have to pay for it!

Your mileage may vary!!!&lt;grin&gt;   LOL

Cheers, dave

&gt; Anyone ever worked out a way to measure fuel flow and convert it into
&gt; real-time MPG?  Some of the luxury cars dating back into the late 70's and
&gt; early 80's had them built into their computers and you could watch the MPG
&gt; on the digital readout on the dash.  Seems like you could put some sort of
&gt; flow monitor between the filter and the carb that you could interperet
&gt; (based on your road speed) into MPG.  Any idea how one would rig it on a
&gt; fuel injection setup to take into account the rate of return flow to the
&gt; tank?  Hey, if James Bond can have an invisible car, why can't I have a MPG
&gt; meter!
