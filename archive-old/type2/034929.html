I recently got a Midland CB radio with weather channels for 49.95 from 
Amazon_dot_com. I cannot attest to the quality of the CB radio part, as I 
have yet to receive anything over it. But the weather radio part is 
great. I managed to pull in a NOAA channel while at Organ Pipe National 
Monument, which is more than 40 miles away from *everything*. 

Here in the west, as Fred can tell you, knowing in advance of high winds 
is more important than CB chit-chat.
