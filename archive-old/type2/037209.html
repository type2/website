Subject: rebuilding: flush oil cooler..?(how?)

I'm doing a top end rebuild ('78 case). I've got the
cylinders off. should I remove the oil cooler and
flush it (how best?). I've owned the bus a year; as
far as I know, there hasn't been any excessive
material in the system.  I understand it's a good idea
to replace it anyway (Muir), but for $100, I'm not
ready to be that cautious.  I don't have any type of
pump, so I'm thinking along the lines of immersion, or
gunk spray.
