&gt;Anyone have a really good &quot;color&quot; scan of a 71West Wiring Diagram that they
&gt;can send me? I down loaded one off the internet but it's really grainy when
&gt;I plot it out. I think it came from vintage bus......

I had the same experience. I printed out the vintage bus scans for my bus and pasted 18 sheets of paper together. It's pretty large but useful. The jpeg compression ruins the readable at that scale.

Can someone tell me more about the Orange Bentley with the color diagrams. What year do the wiring diagrams go up to?
