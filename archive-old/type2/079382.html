&gt; hi  to everyone
&gt;
&gt; I have a 73 2 litre kombi camper, over the last few months the engine
&gt; has been losing power and backfiring causing the vacuum hose elbows to
&gt; detach from the metal hoses, when i checked the valve clearances number
&gt; 1 exhaust didn't have any clearance so I adusted to 6 mm then after a
&gt; monthe it happened again and I adjusted again two weeks past and it
&gt; happened again so i adjusted again.
&gt; The adustments have caused the end of the valve to extend out toward me
&gt; much more than the other valves.
&gt; I wonder what is happening, is the valve stretching?
&gt; what can be done about it?.
&gt;
&gt; please help
