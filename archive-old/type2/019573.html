Subject: Swappin ECUs and stuff

PRELIM INFO:
In my neverending quest to fix my milage on my bus, I have made some
drastic changes.  To begin, here's what I've got:

'76 2000 FI Post Feb (non-california)
'76 2000 FI pre Feb (california model)

Ok, here's the deal.  I've been driving the california model around for
the past few months messin with the AFM.  My milage was horrible and I
just managed to make it worse.  I did check the fuel pressure and it was
good.

So, I thought, I'll take the entire electrical system from the non-cal
model and put it in my Cal model(I junked the non-cal bus and kept the
engine).  Here's what I swapped/changed:

ECU
AFM
Throttle housing (because of full-load enrichment switch)
disconnected EGR valve
plugged case vacuum to EGR valve
put all new vacuum hoses

I think that's everything.  The problem is, the MILAGE IS WORSE!?  I
don't get it.  I was wondering if the california ECU is different from
the non-cal ECU and they have different load settings?  Still though, it
is at about 10 mpg probably now.  Before I had it up to about 13-14.

QUESTION:
So, I guess here's my question:  Are there any major differences between
the pre feb cal model and the post feb non-cal model that I missed?  Are
the cases different besides the case vacuum on the cal model?  Also,
should I use the dizzy from the non-cal with the non-cal setup?(the cal
has the retard hose)

I appreciate any info on this one.  I will soon be geting my extra
injectors cleaned and tested and put those in.  Until then, if anyone's
got some suggestions, I'd appreciate it!

Later,
Mike
