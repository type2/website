I feel lucky to have actually been able to take somewhat of a dream trip last
summer. For those who missed my posts, I have a pretty good account of it on my
web page, the address of which is at the bottom of my .sig.
 Anyway, I, and 5 friends took my bus, a '67 camper, and a '70 camper, and did
about 6000 miles in around 6 weeks. We went from NC to Alabama, New MExico,
Colorado, Indiana, and all over the place. I had a great time, and met some
great folks from on and off the list.
  I enjoy traveling in groups moreso than I think I would traveling in 1 bus
with 1 partner. I think it makes things more interesting, and besides if one
bus has a problem the other can go get help.
  Although I pretty much used up all my favors in getting that much time off
from work last summer, I'm already plotting how I can do something again this
year. It's really a great thing.
  I missed the list trips for the last 2 years, but I'm sure someone will put
something together this year, which hopefully I can make. We've been talking
about doing something here on the east coast, for all of us over here.
  Anyway, I love bus travel, and the only thing that makes it better is
traveling with more busses and their people!
 Happy Friday; hope to see you on the road!
