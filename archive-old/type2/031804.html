Subject: Re: [T2] Sudden Loud Clatter, and then a Dead Engine...

&gt; I bought my 75 bus (1.8L FI) at the beginning of the summer and have put 
&gt; about 2500 miles on it so far with not more than a few hiccups as I've been 
&gt; learning the ropes.  The PO said that a &quot;re-built&quot; engine went in 25,000 

re-built by whom,  for say GEX that is fairly high mileage

did you see the paperwork for that rebuild?? could have just been a top
end rebuild, which may or may not have been done right

&gt; miles ago but other than that I know nothing about this bus's history 

that's the problem with not knowing the history, and why I tend to keep
mine a long time, takes that long to know the history because you did
it yourself

&gt; with no engine noises to signal what was coming, a loud clatter from the 
&gt; engine suddenly came on and the engine cut out.  I immediately put the 
&gt; clutch in and went to neutral and the clatter stopped, but that was it for 
&gt; my beach trip; now if I try to turn the engine over I get only the sound of 
&gt; the starter solenoid ??(the click) but no turnover.  I'm towing it home 

you got some good advice from DW so I'll not repeat what he said.  however
turning it by hand can sometimes tell you a lot. but don't force it.

&gt; anyone venture a guess as to what my problem is, tests I might try to locate 
&gt; it, or other friendly advice??  I have tools and manuals, but not a lot of 

I would highly suspect a valve, they sound like that. but it could be a
dozen or more cheap or $$$$ things

first thing I would do is remove the valve covers.  does one valve spring
stick way up??  if you pull the rocker arms does it fall out???  good sign
it is a valve

&gt; I couldn't see anything obviously wrong from the outside, though something 
&gt; that is probably unrelated did catch my eye: the thermostat ? (spring gizmo 

highly unlikely

good luck
