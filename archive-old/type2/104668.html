Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Weight

You can tow anything with anything if you can stop it.

I've pulled Beetles with my bus with no problem and I've pulled my bus with 
CR-V. Heck I've pulled a Hyundai from VA to TN with my Beetle. I pulled a 
Westy and a car dolly across town with my Bus and with a 4 cylinder Nissian 
2WD pickup. I've towed a late 80's 4WD Ford Bronco 30 miles on a rope with 
a 1200cc Supper Beetle (Italy) in July! I gave up rope towing a long time 
ago though. I've got a tow dolly and a pair of towbars now. None had 
problems going, all would be in trouble stopping. 50 mph was not difficult 
on flat ground. My tow speeds are usually 55 mph tops with a vehicle towing 
a vehicle.

However - with the exception of the VA to TN tow mine have been less than a 
hundred miles and we drove quite conservatively to be easy on the tow 
vehicle and b/c I didn't want to test the (lack of) brakes. My Bus towing a 
Beetle did involve a couple 2000 foot TN mountains and 90 miles each way 
(my barn is 90 miles south of here).

The only way I'd go any LONG distances would be a heavy van or SUV.

Be safe.
