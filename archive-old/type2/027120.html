List,
  HELP! I am the proud owner fo a 78 transporter...My WarHorse...and am 
trying to get her in shape before the rainy season hit us here in Oregon 
(I'm a recent transplant from So. Cal.).
I'm having MAJOR problems finding the sliding metal panel for my sunroof, I 
have tried several parts locator, but so far no luck.
If anyone knows of a source where I might find one, all I need is the panel, 
My mounting hardware and cables are still in good cond., I would greatly 
appreciate it!

                Thanx....

              Michael
78 Transporter....&quot;WarHorse&quot;
