You got that right, Casey.  But, with those constraints you may have to 
become a Gene Berg yourself.

Bottom line: (Two steps)  #1......Have your engine rebuilt by an 
experienced and qualified shop that does type 4 engines all the time, like 
Boston Bob, or Bill at Der WagonWerks in Elyria, Ohio (440-322-9459.) You 
didn't say where you are located.  Tell the guy who will do the work what 
quality and what characteristics you need and ask him what it will cost, 
then modify your demands to fit your budget. And have a reserve fund to 
deal with problems that can't be predicted until the engine is torn 
down.   #2.....Take the engine out, label every connection, wire, bolt, 
hose, duct,etc so you can personally get it back the way it was, and then 
when it comes back _you_ put it together yourself correctly. Take lots of 
photos as you do the tear down. Save all the stuff that comes off in clean 
plastic bags with labels.

The other alternative is to do the _entire_ project yourself, and find a 
way to get the skills to do that.  You save lots of money, and get a vastly 
enlarged set of skills and understandings.

I'm going to take the time and space to say why I make the above 
suggestions: I had my engine rebuilt a different way and got into several 
kinds of problems, mainly by having the work done by three different people 
(who were good mechanics but not VW type 4 engine specialists), and each 
one made one or two mistakes and then passed the engine to the next guy, 
who omitted something or did something wrong, etc.

I ended up with a rebuilt engine that nobody could make run and for which 
no one would take responsibility.

Endless details, if you are still reading: The rebuilt (non-running) engine 
had to come out of the chassis and get an air duct panel installed behind 
the alternator, and it had to have the AMF replaced, and the &quot;S&quot; duct 
between the AFM and the intake was split and had to be replaced, and the 
wiring to the starter was in doubt (as was the majority of the other 
wiring), and all the vacuum lines were confused, then when it ran the first 
time, a rocker arm fractured and the head had to come off and the broken 
rocker arm had to be replaced. Finally, the exhaust headers had to be taken 
off and hand-modified to get a good seal, which required dismantling most 
of the heater boxes and their ducts.

Every system had to be taken apart to some degree and put back together 
about 3 or 4 times.

So, if I could have done it by hiring all the work out to Boston Bob, or 
Bill, or somebody like them, I'd have saved a ton of money. He/they would 
have rebuilt it correctly the first time, and I would have put it back 
together correctly ONCE, and it would not have gone in and out of the 
chassis three different times to get to the place where it was going to run 
at all.

I ended up with a great engine, and I am very happy to have it that 
way.  Getting there took _three years_ from the time it came 
out.........yes, ...3 years.

Saying it another way.....get as few people to do the job as possible, and 
be sure they are very experienced and responsible and will do it right the 
first time. And personally check every part, wire, hose, and connection 
before and during the process of taking it out and putting it back in. 
Don't take any short cuts or make any compromises. Make labels and take 
pictures.  Use new parts when in doubt and when available, and 
examine/test/measure any used parts  before they go into the system.

There aren't nearly enough mechanics in our country who are experienced and 
who understand type 4 air cooled engines.    Find one, pay him what he 
asks, and rejoice when you get what you need. OR, become one 
yourself.  Otherwise, expect and live with some combination of the problems 
that I described above.

Glad to have a 1976 Westfalia with a running engine in Ohio    USA

I would

 &gt;having me send my engine to them. Also what did the rebuild cost? I want to
 &gt;make sure I get it done right the first time. I can't afford a gene berg so
 &gt;don't even suggest it.
