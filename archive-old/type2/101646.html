Subject: Re: [T2] Engine degreasing

	Hi George,
	Gojo is playing both sides of the street... the container
I have is labeled &quot;Gojo Natural Petroleum Free Citrus Formula&quot;

Its ingredients list starts, &quot;Water, D-Limonene, Linear Alcohol, Alkoxylate,
Aloe Extract,...&quot; 

no &quot;Petroleum&quot; but plenty of stuff besides rain water.

	Conclusion: read the fine print. I stand by my recomendation
of this version as both a good degreaser and fair to rinse off over
your lawn. Parafin and mineral oil I would not rinse over the lawn.

	Happy motoring!
	Bill

&gt; &gt; runoff isn't good for anyone. So I switched years ago to using
&gt; &gt; good old  Orange Hand Cleaner, non-abrasive. Gojo or whatever.

George Lyle replied:

&gt; Bad news. Gojo's first three ingredients are water (OK) paraffin (the
&gt; solvent, not the wax) and mineral oil.  Both paraffin and mineral oil are
&gt; petro-chemicals.  The rest of the ingredient list doesn't look like
&gt; something I'd like to eat either!
