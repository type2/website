Subject: planning projects

Hi all,

I'm wondering how people working on old VW busses plan and
prioritize the various projects they need/want to do.  This
is really a question about &quot;how to do life&quot; on a small scale I guess.

Myself, I often make lists of things that need to be done but
sometimes I get to the point where it is hard to decide what
to do first.  My worst problem is finding the time to do everything.
I don't have a garage but I do have a carport and the evenings are
dark and cool now.  (In summer, they are light and HOT!)
(on weekends I often find myself out &quot;doing life&quot; rather than working
 on vehicles :-)

So, last night, I figgured I'd best prioritize the things I want
to do to the old bus.  I was surprised that, after thinking about
some of this on paper, the order of the tasks changed quite a bit.
I also divided the list into &quot;things that need to be done to prevent
the old bus from deteriorating any further&quot; and &quot;things that need to be
done to make the vehicle more fun or more comfortable or better looking&quot;.

As an example, here is the current, near term, list:

What do other people do?

Of course there are other lists associated with traveling in the bus, ie.,

      things to take on camping trips
      things to take on long road trips
      places to go / camp / great hikes / great mountain bike rides
      people who want to go with us
      etc.

Can you say anal-retentive? I knew you could! (works for me tho...)

Cheers,

 -Dyer
