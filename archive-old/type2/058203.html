Subject: RE: 79 Cal Exhaust Parts
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt; In the middle of a rebuild on a '79 (square exhaust ports) with california
&gt; emissions setup, and I found out that I've got a major crack in
&gt; the exhaust manifold between #3 and #4.  I've heard that this part is not
available
&gt; new.  Anyone out there got a good used one?
&gt;
&gt; I need a good new or used passenger side heater box for this van.  I would
&gt; prefer original, as long as it is in good shape.

Tim,
If you don't find good used ones call me.  I have new '79-only heat
exchangers.  Also I can now get the '79 California-only left side manifold
and heat exchanger new, although they're expensive :-(
