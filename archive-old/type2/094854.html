Subject: Poor man's ammeter.



Hi All,

I was interested in current in and out of the car battery so I installed a 
battery ground cable approximate 0.001 ohms resistance and used a Harbor 
Freight $4.99 (now on sale)CEN-TECH digital voltmeter to measure the voltage 
drop across it. The 4GA ground cable is 2' long. The cable resistance is 
approximately 0.0005 ohm and the connectors add another 0.0005 ohm for the 
0.0001 ohm total. To avoid contact pressure variation problems I used 
plastic wire ties to hold the 22GA meter wire terminals to the metal barrel 
part of the 4GA cable connectors. One wire at the negative battery terminal 
end and the other 2' away at the chassis ground end

The nice features of this set up is that the long meter wires can be thin 
(22GA) and the system voltage regulator shouldn't be confused with the low 
voltage drops as is the case with some auto ammeters.

On the meter 200 mV range, 1 mV is equivalent to approximately 1 amp. I 
hooked it up so that &quot;-&quot; negative sign shows up in the battery discharge 
mode.

During start up I read -130 mV(amps). The nominal running voltage drop is so 
low (less than 50 mV) that the system voltage regulator handles it with 
ease.

The meter is high enough impedance that 10 or so feet of 22 GA twisted pair 
didn't cause a noticeable error.

The meter runs off a 9 volt battery but should run off a 12 volt system with 
a 5.1 volt series zener or a dropping resistor. The same meter with a LCD 
back light is on sale for $6.49 at Harbor.

I prototyped this ammeter on my old Datsun and will test it for a while and 
then install the same thing on my VWs.




Chuck
