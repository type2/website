I pulled the motor on the 81 specifically to do the torque converter seal
since I was leaking ATF badly. While I had the motor out, I replaced my piston
rings which seemed to have worked well but the trans leaks as badly as ever.
Since it's nice and clean now I can see the fine red spray from the torque
converter and of course the larger drips when I shut it off.

What could be the problem here? The new seal went in under finger pressure, no
force necesssary. I pushed it as far as it would go. Would it make any
difference if it were flush with the rim instead of being pushed back? Anyone?

Thanks,

Weston
