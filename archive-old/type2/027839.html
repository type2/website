Russell I haven't seen an expert reply yet.  i had the same problem.  I 
suspect your steering wheel spokes no longer point left-right.  I don't know 
the technical term but there is a section of the lower ring of the wheel 
that extends into the switch and it contacts the cancel cam.  If the wheel 
is mis aligned it prevents the switch from staying on.  You can remove and 
realign your steering wheel (what I did) or rotate your switch parallel with 
the spokes.  It might also suggest that your alignment up front is off.

&gt;&gt;1971 Westy:  Turn signal switch is at best &quot;iffy&quot; as far as staying on 
&gt;&gt;when you switch on the turn signals.  Most of the time it snaps right back 
&gt;&gt;after you let go of it. I took it out of the housing yesterday and 
&gt;&gt;inspected it, but this thing is a serious excercise in mechanical 
&gt;&gt;complexity.  I could not determine what was worn and what might be done to 
&gt;&gt;make it work better. Electrically, the switch works fine.  Any 
&gt;&gt;suggestions?&lt;&lt;
