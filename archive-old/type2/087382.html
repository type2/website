Subject: engine won't go in

This Spring, I pulled a 1600DP from my '71 Westy to rebuild it. 
While doing the rebuild, I bought another 1600DP  from a fellow in 
another state. I did a quick top end rebuild but used the flywheel 
and clutch assembly that came with the second one.

Today was to have been the big day to put this one into the bus. It 
won't go.   It goes to within say 3/4&quot; of full mating with the bell 
housing, but no further. No amount of wiggling the engine or rotating 
the pulley would make it go.

I rolled the engine back into the garage and compared the 
flywheel/clutch assembly with the one from the original engine.  The 
only difference I can see is that the original pressure plate is the 
type that has  many fingers that contact the release bearing. The new 
plate has a solid ring that evidently makes this contact.

Can anyone suggest why I can't get the engine to mate?
Is the difference in pressure plates significant?

Thanks, Jack
