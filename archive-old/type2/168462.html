Subject: Re: [WetWesties] Re: [T2] Can we weld new exhaust manifold
  flanges on our hea...

Actually I was bouncing this question off the list to see if the metal was weldable on the exhaust and if anyone has done it before. I'll just ignore the negativity. Scott answered my question, stating the flanges are just mild steel, and that is why they corrode. I was wondering if they were cast iron or not, as I've had trouble welding cast iron. I have a mig welder, but am def. not a good welder. Still learning. These are the kind of projects that I like to try. 
I ask questions on this list to learn. I am sure most others do too. Lectures I don't need, had enough of them in university and the military. :-/

&gt; You  shoulda been on the job already, had it all done, and 
&gt; then ranted
&gt; about how  you cured the problem rather than waiting on the 
&gt; computer for
&gt; an answer of  approval.

&gt; 
&gt; Well, maybe he's 90% sure that he can do it but by asking around 
&gt; to see if  
&gt; others have done it, he could be 100% sure? What's wrong with 
&gt; asking questions? 
&gt;  I think this forum lends itself to questions and I don't 
&gt; think they should 
&gt; be  discouraged. Just my 2 cents worth on a cool and misty 
&gt; Seattle afternoon. 
&gt; Fall  is here for sure. Cheers,
