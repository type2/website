Tom,

I am not certain about this, but I think you are right. The locking cap for
the thing 181 definitely works on late split window busses, which are
similar to early bay if I recall correctly.

There is a VW locking cap, which is very dear, I just got one an ebay_dot_de and
it was a steal at 48 euro, I have seen this cap on thesamba for nearly 200
bucks, one of those crazy prices that makes no sense, really.
