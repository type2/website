Subject: RE: [T2] Is this happening to you?

Listers,
	My perspective on this thread is one who has come back to VW after
about 15 years away. A chance encounter with a guy restoring an old Karmann
Ghia re-awakened my air-coooled interest. Now I have a 67 Bug and a 78 Bus.
	What has changed in the interim is the sense of community that now
exists among old VW drivers (and drivers of old VW's). It used to be that
driving a VW was more a matter of necessity, due to financial reasons. Now
its a choice made by people who love the simple genius of the design and
the uniqueness of the vehicle. So we all have something in common. We could
be driving the proverbial Honda Civic, but we want to feel connected to our
vehicle and its well-being.
	I work at a large university and gave a ride to a couple of
students yesterday. On the way I passed another Bus and the driver waved.
The students said &quot;do you know that guy&quot;, I said no, but in a way I do,
because he's driving an air-cooled VW. &quot;That's so cool&quot; they said and spent
the rest of the drive looking for old Volkswagens to wave to.
	I think people envy the connection we have to each other and our
cars, which accounts for the increase in spontaneous contact on the road.
In know it can be annoying, but take it as a compliment and smile.

&gt;Well, we choose to drive around in an archetypal symbol of kinder analog
&gt;times. I do it because it makes me feel like that. Other people like to be
&gt;reminded too. I reckon that it indicates the removal of a nice comfort zone
&gt;from our culture and all these people want it back. Lucky us.
&gt;	Be like your van, nice. Who else can do it?

&gt;Driving my split around town gets me the slack-jawed
&gt;&gt; gapers and the
&gt;&gt; occasional compliments, last week some guy in a &quot;Trans-Am&quot; gave
&gt;&gt; me the peace
&gt;&gt; sign....&quot;oh ick&quot;. I suppose they mean well, on the other hand
&gt;&gt; maybe they're
&gt;&gt; just being smart asses.
&gt;&gt; Sometimes I enjoy the &quot;when I was a kid, I drove across the rockies in one
&gt;&gt; of those...&quot; when I'm buying gas, and sometimes I've got other
&gt;&gt; things on my
&gt;&gt; mind; I always try to be nice and personable; I'm always hoping
&gt;&gt; for the one
&gt;&gt; time someone will come up and say &quot;You know, I've got a couple of those
&gt;
