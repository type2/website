&lt;&lt;I found a 70 Westy at a wrecking yard here in Fresno, Calif. It is 
mostly all there interior wise. It still has the upper cot frame but no 
canvas material. It has the strangest Westfalia deluxe set-up I've seen. 
It is not a walk-thru. The sink/stove/cooler unit is almost the full 
width. The top of it lifts up and tilts forward like a 76-79 Deluxe 
stove top. It has the wardrobe unit as part of the sink/stove/cooler 
unit and it stands up behind the drivers seat. The drivers side middle 
window is one solid piece of glass. Has a jump seat along the driver 
wall between the wardrobe and bench seat/bed. On this jump seat is the 
support rings for the table leg. The table pivots like a 76-79. The leg 
was gone but the table was there. It's a little rough on one corner and 
has the whiteish top. All the cabinet doors have the white vinyl trim on 
the edges. The inside of the sink/stove top is white laminate [76-79 is 
wood grain].   Anybody want anything from it?&gt;&gt;

All I want is the part you do not have, the table leg. The table would be nice
but I think I can find one. :-(  Any help? I think some of the the pre 68's
had the same table setup.

What you have there is the 1969/70 &quot;Stockholm&quot; or &quot;Brussels&quot; German model. Not
available in the USA. Depends on the rear pad. Am assumeing there is a blind
spot cabinet. Other models had a full rear bed ( 1970 should, I think). I have
the &quot;Rome&quot; model that is similar but walkthrough. 

Might be interested in the rear pad if it does cover the spare tire hole and
is in great condition.
