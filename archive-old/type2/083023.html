Subject: RE: [T2] Paint &amp; Primers

whereas it has been established that &quot;diff'rent strokes for diff'rent
volks&quot; as to the level of desired paint cost/effect... ie. ranging
from an application of tar to a $10k+ showroom restoration, and a
variety of degrees therein,

Here's my situation:

78 Bus, for which I paid a fair price.  I've stripped the interior
and sanded down the little rust nubs and ground the larger rust areas
(mostly located in the vicinity of a window sill).  I've ordered an
AVP engine and a bus-load of parts from Ron (including all new rubber
everywhere, VDO gauges, and other things needed for the new engine). 
All glass has been removed.  All interior panels and seats have been
removed.  even the dashboard is out.  Cost of engine and bus-load of
parts:  $3000+.  I don't care for a $5000-6000+ paint job, as I
intend to drive my bus regularly and park it where I go.

My plan (way in progress) is to prep the bejeezus out of this thing
and tow it to a Maaco or other local paint/body shop.  I'd do it
myself if I had a paint booth and equipment.  Whoever paints it will
do so with a urethane based product.

Now.  Lately the list has seen mention of various primer products and
rust converters etc, which has confused me more than helped.  I have
three different rattle can primer products from NAPA (Martin Senour):
 Self Etching Primer, Primer-Sealer, and Primer-Surfacer.  The Sealer
is a &quot;non-sanding&quot; product, whatever that means.

THE QUESTION

What exactly (using specific product names) should I do to the bare
metal spots and pitted rust areas, keeping in mind that it could be
another week or so before I can get the rig to a painter?

Thanks for your interest and experience.
