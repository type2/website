Subject: Thanks to all who replied about foam seal (help me get to HCBF)!

Thanks guys!  I get the point!  I hereby promise to *NEVER* drive my bus 
without that seal!  I'll not be cheap about that one, I'll buy the right 
part.  Seriously though, this is not to make light, you all saved me a very 
expensive engine rebuild.  I am so glad I found this list, and I have 
recommended it to everybody I've seen with a bus.

Lesson learned the easy way,
Jay Ollom
