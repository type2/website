Since we are on this topic, what size drill/tap should be used to do this 
procedure. Also what size bolts should be used? Im looking at installing an 
AE bug motor into my '71 single cab.

&gt;A 1974 case may have the bosses... does it have the place for the three
&gt;bolts?  If so, you can tap (drill holes) them pretty easily and that would
&gt;be the BEST solution.
