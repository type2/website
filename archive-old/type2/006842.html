I recently switched due to the arrogance of my former supplier - now use
Allstate. I have 20/40/15K liability, and 20/40/15k uninsured driver
coverage. I pay $401.00; I am 31, drive it less than once a week (tho I
have no milage restrictions on my policy... I just hate driving w/ these
Austin MORONS!), and just noticed that they have me listed as a 1970 VW
Vanagon! I got a pretty good rate, considering I must have a test model!
Seriously, it pays to shop around...
