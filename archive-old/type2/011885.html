Hi Volks!

&gt; I'm going on a trip for at least a month, but
&gt; maybe as long as 6 months and am wondering about some basic outdoor winter
&gt; (Trail, B.C., Canada) storage info - battery, carb, oil, cover, dessicants,
&gt; tires etc. What to do?

My opinion (for what it's worth) in short words:

Battery: Remove, keep indoors.  Maybe put on one of those smart
  chargers that keep the battery alive.
Carb: Nothing.
Engine: A bit of oil into each cylinder (through the spark plug
  hole, and reinsert plug) would be good against rust.  On
  return do a full tune-up before long.
Oil: Change before and after.  Oil's cheap.
Tank: Fill it up before you leave.
Cover: Don't do it, wind might result in paint scratching.
Chrome and paint: Wash and wax before and after.  Apply wax
  liberally to the chrome.
Interior: Put some bowls of cat litter into the bus, it
  helps keep the interior dry.  That makes mold stains less
  likely.  Keep the fridge open.  Remove the cooking gas
  bottles and the batteries for the heater, if any.
Dessicant: There's no such word in my dictionary, sorry.
Tires: If possible, put it on jack stands.  Else increase pressure.
  Don't forget to decrease it again when you get back.
Brakes: Do *NOT* put the hand brake on, it'd possibly rust
  locked.
Other: Make sure the place is going to be there still when
  you get back, i.e., don't park it where roadwork might occur.
  They'd tow it, and you'd be broke for storage cost.  And
  if possible, pick a dry day to park it, and have it run
  warm before you do, in order to trap in as little
  moisture as possible.

That's what I'd consider optimal.  It'd probably work just
fine if you merely parked it (mine always do), but hey,
a little tender loving care can't be bad can it?  :-)

Hope this helps.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
