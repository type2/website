Subject: Shavings in oil
Date: Sat, 14 Apr 2001 12:09:30 +0100

Thanks for all the replies about my shavings.  Looks like the general
consensus is that they are bearings.  I will keep a close eye on the oil to
check if any more appears.  To answer Mick's comment about the oil light,
no it doesn't flicker but I will be keeping a close eye on that as well
from now on.
I think this would be a good time to start collecting parts for a rebuild
so it doesn't bite me later on.  I have the original engine (145k miles)
and I don't know if it's been rebuilt before.  Compression is a bit low on
one cylinder but not excessive, fuel consumption is OK and she still pulls
well, so I'm not *too* worried.  I only do about 5000 miles a year anyway.
