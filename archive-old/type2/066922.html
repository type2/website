Subject: LiMBO/NEATO TTT Directory - anyone use?

Hey
Im planning on driving cross country from Ma this winter or next spring.  
Being a Limbo member I have access to the TTT directory.  Ive used it 
before, just to get some info on mechanics in my area, but every time 
I've called someone, they are shocked and it takes me a while to explain 
how I got their number.  For the most part they don't seem too friendly 
as I expected/hoped. :(  I would hope to use it as I travel, but don't 
want to impose on these people.  has anyone used it to greater success?
