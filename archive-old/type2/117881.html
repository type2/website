Subject: RE: [T2] Oil temp sender/sump plate

Yes I use one on my typeI engine.  Cheap insurance.  Its pretty darn
simple, but works.  Watch out though, the first one I got was calibrated
to some temp much higher than 227 F (what it should be).  Good idea to
test in boiling water before installing.  Also a good idea to wire it to
another light besides your oil light (like you did) so you don't have to
wonder when that light comes on!

&gt; Has anyone else used the Gene Berg dipstick sender for oil temp.  I wired it
&gt; to an unused warning light on the dash (CAT, I believe)  I think it switches
&gt; on around 220-230.
