The reason that the fan isn't working is that the motor has to be RUNNING.
It runs off the alternator, and if the alternator isn't spinning that
neither will the fan.  Start the motor, then go back and look at the fan.
it should work then.

BTW, most heat will be pushed by the cooling fan on the back of the motor,
the little electric fan is pretty worthless, as far as I can tell.  I
never use mine.
