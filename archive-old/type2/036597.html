Subject: camper purchase question

Hello All,
  I asked Thom to post this for me as I am no
longer a listee of the Baywindow list (I am on
other VW lists). 
 I have the opertunity to get a 74 Bus for a real
good price and would like to find out a litte
more about it. The biggest thing I found strange
about it is that the vin# starts 234, meaning
that of course its a Bus(2), and a 74(4), but it
is a Kombi,camper, etc.(3). However it is setup
like a cargo van with windows. It has no
headliner behind the driver, the door panels in
front are just like Westies(no armrest/air tube)
and the rear of the bus is very striped. There
are plain door panels, no coverings. No heat
vents under the seat, just all painted a light
tan color. It does have both rear seats though.
The windows are all solid exept one, behind the
driver. There was never a sunroof, and no signs
of ever being converted to a camper. 
  It looks like the basic Bus that was used to
make a Westy/Safare/Riviara camper, but never
was. Someone may have added the rear seats, they
do match the very plain front seats, but are just
black. 
  I guess what seems strange to me is that I have
never seen one this new set up like this that was
not a camper. Why would they sell them like this,
what were they used for? Cargo? Why the seats? I
bet this thing is very loud. Were many like this
made? 
  I would love to get a camper for my son and I
to go out in, this could be made into a real nice
camper. The body is O.K. and it runs, best of all
the price is right, Free! It needs paint and a
little body work, and the clutch fixed.
  Anyway any info that you may know about this
type of Bus would be great. Any idea of how many
might there be out there that were never
converted like this one?
 Because I am not on the list as of yet(will join
if I get it) please send responces to me at
solomon_scott_at_yahoo_dot_com Thanks!
