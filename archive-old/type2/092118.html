Subject: Re: Looking for fuel system parts, 81 Vanagon

Thanks all for the technical information (parts list/assembly
information). I
was able to get the vent tank grommets at VW (as no one else seems to
have
them), only four left in their stock by the way. But I am still on the
lookout
for the &quot;fuel filler neck with restriction for leadfree gasoline&quot;. VW
part
number 251-201-119A. The current ETKA images show part numbers
251-201-119 (B
or D), but none are available either at VW. Anyone know who else may
carry
this? I have checked  Bus Depot, Vanagain and Bus Boys current catalogs
but
will email them.
Regards
--Jeff Strickrott
