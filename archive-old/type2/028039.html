Subject: RE: [T2] starter problems

&gt; To make a very long story short, we have replaced it 4 times in
&gt; as many weeks.  The first one only lasted 5 starts, the next was
&gt; about 12 starts, the next ;asted 3 days, and the last one only 1
&gt; start.


I would be extremely surprised if this were a case of 4 defective starters
in a row. Unless their starters are absolute crap, the odds of getting four
bad in a row are extremely low.  I can't think of a single instance where
any rebuilder I've ever dealt with delivered four consecutive defective
units, or even two for that matter.  It's more likely that there is another
problem.

Have you first installed a Bosch WR1 starter relay kit (under $8), which
often tends to solve many alleged &quot;starter problems&quot; on busses?  Have you
thoroughly checked for corroded, loose, or incorrect connections, at both
ends of the wires? Have you checked your battery condition, and preferably
load-tested it? And, of course, have you acertained that the original Bosch
and/or VW part number on the ones they're giving you is correct for your
year (or more accurately, the yearl of the engine/trans/bellhousing in your
bus, which may or may not be &quot;correct&quot; for your bus)?  (Remember, too, that
stick and auto are different.)

If you have not done all of the above, you could replace your starter a
hundred times and still never solve the problem, because there is a
reasonable chance that the starter is not at fault to begin with.
