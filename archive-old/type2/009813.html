&gt; well, long story short: i drove my 1971 for 4 days with the oil light
&gt; on. she always did leak oil (incredible amounts!), and so she died.
she
&gt; started to shudder and slow down, losing power til she died. shaking
and
&gt; making knocking sound. got some oil in her later that day, she drove
til
&gt; that night, same thing happened. please, im sorry, no judgements, i
know
&gt; what i did was wrong. i havent touched the van in a couple of
months. i
&gt; can give more details...anyone who might be able to help?

Sounds like it's complete rebuild time.  Time to either take the
engine to a competent rebuilder, equip yourself with Muir, Bentley,
and Wilson and rebuild it yourself, or get a new engine from
Beetlemex, et al.  Which path you follow depends upon the amount of
time and money you possess.

_Don't_ buy a &quot;crate engine&quot; from GEX and similar rebuilders.  The
parts for a good rebuild cost more than they charge for an exchange
engine, which should give you an idea of their quality.  If a part is
95% worn out, it is still &quot;in spec&quot; and will be reused in the engine
they sell to you.  Learn from my mistake!

At $1050, the Beetlemex brand new engine is pretty darned attractive. 
It is a few hundred more than the rebuild parts would cost, but you
get a brand new case.  The existing cases are getting pretty long in
the tooth and the chances of yours being good is questionable.
