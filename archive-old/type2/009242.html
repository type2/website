&gt;       I've been driving diesel VW since my first 1984 Diesel Rabbit. Now I

&gt;   air-cooled engine. The original engine of my westy was a 1700cc
&gt;   dual-carb, but I hate this engine so I've installed a single-port 1600cc
&gt;   (47 hp DIN) and it's great because I don't need to drive my westy at top
&gt;   speed.   And one of these days, Iwould like to install a diesel engine a
&gt;   my 1972 type II.
&gt;
&gt;       Do you have an idea where I could find informations for my project
&gt;   ??

This is doable. Mexican loafs use I4 gas engines which are bolt-
equivalent with the diesels. Conversion would involve getting 
parts (engine mounts, bell housing, flywheel, cooling
system etc.) from a crashed Mexican loaf. Install engine mounts
and engine, run coolant hoses and cut out the nose for a
radiator and grill.
