Subject: Re: [T2] ok to drive w/o &quot;r&quot;

I'm not sure what the failure mode is on the bus transmissions, but I
had a spectacular crash in a '58 Beetle when the transmission
completely failed going down the highway.  It also wouldn't stay in
reverse, even if you held it there, and it popped out of first.

Luckily, I was on a divided highway, it was 3am and the road was
quiet.  I was going about 65 mph (maximum and cruising speed).  Must
have been on a slight downhill.  Both rear wheels locked up, then it
spun around a few times and finally rolled a few times.  Of course, no
seatbelts in a '58, so I ended up thrown out of the car on one of the
roll overs (it lost a fair bit of speed by then) and in the grass on
the side of the road.  The car never left the pavement.  A family
traveling the other way stopped to see if anyone survived the spinning
headlights and found me cursing the car and looking for my glasses in
the grass.  They were kind enough to give me a ride to a friend's
place.  I was lucky enough to come out of it with only a few scratches
and bruises.  I even found my glasses.

&gt; while my &quot;new&quot; transmission for Maude (72 riviera) is
&gt; in transit for the right side of the country, is it
&gt; safe to be driving her even though reverse is totally
&gt; non-existant? other than around town stuff, i need to
&gt; get a friend's place tomorrow, about 150 miles round
&gt; trip.
