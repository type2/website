Subject: Prayers for Jerry Jess

This afternoon, Jerry had a severe stroke which paralyzed him and took away
his speech.  He is doing a bit better this evening.  He can speak with
difficulty and move most of the left side of his body. His right leg is
still paralyzed and he only has partial use of his right arm.  He is in
intensive care at the Mayo Clinic Hospital.  

 

Prayers and good thoughts are desperately needed.

Thank you, Melissa Jess
