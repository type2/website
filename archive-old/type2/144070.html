Subject: Re: [T2] It just wont run

Same thing happened to me when I replaced the fuel lines on my '79 CAL
engine.

Karl discovered with his multimeter a disconnected ground to the ECU located
underneath the intake manifold which killed power to something.  I had
inadvertantly bumped it off while working.

I mention the '79 CAL specifically because I seem to remember Karl mentioning
that this ground is located somewhere else on other engines or something like
that.

Check all your engine grounds, and other silly disconnections, ECU? Battery?
Distributor?

&gt; I replaced all the fuel lines from the filler neck to the injectors
&gt; and now she wont run.  I took out the ECU, and the injectors, as well
&gt; as the firewall.  It all went back into place (some with a little
&gt; coaxing) with out too much trouble.   But now, the bus just wont run.
