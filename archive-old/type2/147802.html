&gt;My Agenda?  (1) PDX area T2 members meet one another
&gt;face-to-face.  (2) T2 members discuss maintenance
&gt;issues.  (3) Improve my understanding of maintenance
&gt;of my T2. 
&gt;   
&gt;What are your thoughts, PDX T2 members?

Have you thought about further cross-pollenating this to thesamba_dot_com?  
There's a bunch of &quot;us Portlanders&quot; who hang out over there in the Bay 
Bus Forum that I never see here .. and vice-versa of course.  

After Colin/Amskeptic's whirlwind pass through Portland last year, some
of the Samba-haunting Bus owners were gathering at the SE Hawthorne
Lucky Lab brewpub on &quot;Miser Mondays&quot; .. utterly informal, whoever felt
like showing up.  I need to get that restarted now that the weather is 
turning decent.  

&gt;I suggest calling this thread [T2] Champoeg PDX Mech
&gt;Maint Roundtable....

Suggestion duly noted in the subject line. :-)
