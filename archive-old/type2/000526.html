Hi all,
    I just got a shipment from west coast metric and my new 72-79 parcel
trays were in it. At first glance, I'm a little disappointed. They look
sorta homemade. I think they used scrap rubber poptop seals on them or
something.  NOT a real nicely crafted product. Also, the mesh looks like it
will dryrot very quickly. I'm wondering if I shouldn't have left my a/c in.
Has anyone had these for a while?  Should I send em back and try to find
some origies? To my knowledge, WCM is the only maker of these currently.
Bye
Jay
