Subject: Re: [T2] Modern day CD player into our Bay windows??

Ok, so I'm curious now...

Can somebody whose dash has NOT been cut, but is a nearly DIN sized hole,
and never had a DIN stereo in it take a pic of the edge of the metal?

Ideally, someone who's owned the bus from day one. I'm thinking that *if*
the dash hole is nearly DIN sized, maybe that bus was sold stereo-less and
used a blockoff? And the ones that did come with a radio had the
circle-rectangle-circle opening. Doesn't make a lot of sense but it may be a
German thing. &quot;Zis vun haz no Blaupunkt, zo needz NO
zircle-rectangle-zircle!&quot;
