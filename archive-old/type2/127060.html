Subject: Re: [T2] Share your original paperwork...

&gt; So my bus has driven around Europe? Cool! =D

&gt; At least they drove it to some port to have it shipped back. Tourist
Delivery was popular with servicemen stationed in Germany.

&gt; Check the lower left corner of the m-plate for UT. That indicates tourist
delivery. Normally the code describes which wrold shipping port the vehicle
was destined for.

****Got any idea about &quot;UX&quot; as the destination on the m-plate?  I found tourist guides to Brussels under my jump seat so I have kinda wondered where this bus came from......
