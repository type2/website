1600 motors were meant for Buses until 1971. 1973 buses take a 1700-2000 
motor. They're different motors. I don't recommend putting the 1600 motor in 
the late bus, especially one that's been modified for higher performance. 
Here's why:
A 1600 motor is designed to perform at a certain level. Say 50-53 
horsepower.  When people modify it and bore out the cylinders and increase 
the displacement above stock, They thin the tolerance and stretch and ask 
more out of components that were engineered to only handle stock 
applications. That's why you see so many people out there wondering why their 
motors are running hot, their oil pressure is off, the car is backfiring, has 
deadspots, won't start in the morning, etc. So a 1600 motor with a displacem
ent larger than stock is already suspect, just going into a pre-71 bus or 
bug. Now  the 72 and up buses had a new larger higher displacement engine 
engineered for them, and when it's well maintained is more reliable and 
stronger, running between 65 - 88 horsepower, depending on the it's 
compression ratio, bore and all that good stuff, and it runs cooler and holds 
a bit more oil, I wouldn't fool with putting a 1600 in there. For one thing 
you have to custom make the sheet metal, and figure out how to make the rear 
mount compatable, and all that work will be for a questionable at best 
overworked 1600, which will undoubtably start running too hot on the #3 
valve. 

If you want more power in your 73, I'd suggest two options:    

1) a new rebuilt 1700. I've just rebuilt a 411 motor for my 1700 and the 
power is all there. 
2) Rebuild an 1800 or 2000  motor for your 73 bus. This will increase the 
power while keeping a stock VW motor in the van it was meant to go in.
