Hi Dan,
I called their tech support number, and yes, they do have a dual 
function meter.
A nominal 2 1/16 &quot; mounting diameter. LED indication.
Made by SPA in the U.K.
That guy costs around $300.OO USD +, so it ain't cheap, but it would 
sure do the job.

I'll keep the list posted as to what I find out, after I get the 
catalogue, and after I (perhaps) buy one.
