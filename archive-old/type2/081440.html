Subject: Re: [T2] Timing questions

From: &quot;Blake Haralson&quot;
&gt;I hate to drive this thing into the ground, but I am
becoming a bit concerned. The VW number for my
distributer was wrong as I reported it. the correct
number is 311 905 205T. The number that apparently
doesn't exist: 0 231 167 014 is the correct number
that is stamped into the body of my distributer. I
tried to look it up myself and I agree: it doesn't
exist. Karl, I will email you a photo of this thing
that may help identify it as I do not know how to set
up a link for everyone. (This photo, showing the
numbers, will also hopefully prove that I am not
insain or dyslexic) If this is not the right
distributer for my bus, am I in danger of toasting my
valves or something? Also, what distributer (that is
compatible with my bus) do most recommend?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No, you are not nuts or insane.....you do have a 014 on your dist. The 311
number leads me to believe it is a type3 dist. But the T does not show up. If
it is a type3 it would have to be pre-FI because FI distributors have trigger
points in the base. You do not have a cover on the other side, do you?
A 1500S with twin carbs before Aug 65 has a 311 905 205D.
A 1500S with twin carbs from Aug 65 has a 311 905 205F.

Here is the correct dist. for your bus:

Bus &amp; Pickup 1975-Early 1976 * 1800 (75), 2000 (76) Manual Trans

Distributor: VW 021-905-205AB, 0231 176 048, 022-905-205AB, 0231 181 012

(5400rpm)
Cap: 03 010

Ignition Wires: 09 171

&gt; &gt;Oh yes, I didn't mention the distributer. To be
&gt; honest
&gt; with you, I cannot tell you what kind it is, but the
&gt; numbers on it's body are exactly as follows:
&gt; JFUR 4
&gt; 0 231167014
&gt; 31905 205T
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; A couple of problems with your distributor
&gt; numbers.....
&gt; 0 231 167 014  comes up as unknown. 014 is wrong.
&gt;
&gt; You are missing something in the beginning of the
&gt; last number.
&gt; The 905 205 part is correct. But the 31 in front is
&gt; wrong. Should be a 3 digit
&gt; number. The T at the end only shows up on a 113 905
&gt; 205T but that is a 69-70
&gt; bug or bus dist. Totally wrong for your 1800 type4
&gt; engine. The 113T is for a
&gt; 1500-1600 upright fan type1 engine.
&gt;
&gt; Please look again.
