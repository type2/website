Subject: Re: [T2] Re: auxiliary battery

David,

I have three or four of the horrible freight ones and they seem to work 
well on everything from my riding lawn mower to 3 vw's.

Did you actually take one apart in the store? and look at the circuits?

Picked mine up on sale for $5.00 each.

Bottom line for me is that they were relatively cheap...it appears that 
the rest of them tend to run about $50+.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Unfortunately, the Harbor Freight one is garbage.  I took a close

&gt; This charger does nothing more than pump a constant 500ma through 
&gt; the battery.  It does not appear to have a voltage regulator and 
&gt; probably relies on the relatively low amperage to keep from 
&gt; overcharging a typical automotive-sized battery.  It has no 
&gt; business being called a float charger.  Save your money for 
&gt; something with a bit more sophistication, IMO.

&gt; &gt; Horrible Freight sells this one. Works very well and is 
&gt; reasonable when it is on sale:
