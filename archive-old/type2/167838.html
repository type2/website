Subject: TGiFGram: chopped splittie

	The other day in Auckland I happened to notice rolling into a 
petrol station a dark blue '64 splitty with no windows except front 
seat &amp; windscreen, big chrome VW emblem on front, no air scoops on 
the intake louvres, and extremely lowered suspension  -  altogether a 
downright groovy appearance.
	The owner had just brought it from Nelson, a lower-rust 
region in the S. Is.  He told me he'd merely &quot;inverted the spindles&quot; 
to achieve the lowest ground-clearance as seen in 
http://www.busselecta_dot_com/bus/.
	I sooled him onto air scoops for the intake louvres  -  a new 
idea on him.  Also - and I know T2 listees will find this difficult 
to believe  -  I told him how to slap water-injection into his 1500 
SP.
