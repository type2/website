Subject: Re: [T2] Tail Light Installation - Help!!!

What year bus?

&gt;Ok, I've got some brand new tail light assemblies (housing, seal, &amp; lens) 
&gt;and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get these 
&gt;installed.  There must be some kind of trick that I'm missing but I can't 
&gt;seem to keep the housing installed in the groove in the rubber seal and at 
&gt;the same time install the seal into the hole in the body (or vice versa, 
&gt;install seal into body and then try to install housing into its groove).
