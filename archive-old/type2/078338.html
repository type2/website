Subject: Re: [T2] possible purchase of bus -- first post

After reading the great replies on this thread, I thought I'd put my 2cents 
worth in...
If this is your first bus, buy a well maintained bus, prefferably by a PO 
that knows the buses history...get all the papperwork he has on any work, 
parts,brochures,or resources, and ask him about the perculularities of the 
bus...the things that are irritable or what he was planning in the near and 
far future as a good maintenance planning...because you will become familiar 
with your bus...then, as you enjoy owning and mainaining a VWVAN...after you 
have created a solid base of &quot;good feelings&quot; for your bus...and after you 
have named your bus, THEN do a creative VWVAN resoration or fixerupper
''project&quot;...it is also good the have a  Sympathetic Significant Other  who 
has a similar solid base of positive bus experiance. 
Nuffsaid,
Jeff Raven
