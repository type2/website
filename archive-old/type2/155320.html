Subject: RE: [T2] Strange engine

&quot;some other carburetor induced trouble. Do you have a spare
carb to swap in?&quot;

Yeah, I would suspect carb issues since this carb hasn't been really that
&quot;kind&quot; to me. I don't have another carb. But, there is no sputter, no power
let-down or poor idle. It stops just like a light switch, click, Off. No
amount of pedal thumping or choke adjusting makes any difference. As soon as
I cycle the ignition, try again, it fires, teases me, and then Shuts Off
again.

&quot;I'd suppose a vacuum leak could cause this, if you have any places where
one could develop.&quot;

Vacuum leak would also have some sort of sputter, power-loss, black smoke or
rough idle. I checked all the usual Type 1 places. Both intake manifolds are
tight, the manifold boots are tight and brand-new, All the carb bolts are
tight with new seals and the vacuum line to the Dizzy is tight and new.

But, I'm not going to rule any of those things out until I give her a good
once over tomorrow (sniffles permitting).

guess the idle jet got clogged
somehow, or some other carburetor induced trouble. Do you have a spare

I'd suppose a vacuum leak could cause this, if you have any places where

(I can tell you stories about the carb on our '65 icing up)
