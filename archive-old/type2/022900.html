Made a long road trip to NC this past Thursday and bought an a/c system 
from a great guy named Kirk.

It's for one of those 'future' improvements.

Got a couple of questions I hope somebody can answer.

The unit is made by &quot;Cool Inc.&quot; It has 4 places where it looks like duct 
work might attach but there wasn't any duct work there - I even got a 
chance to take a look under Kirk's dash to look for missing parts.

Were these extra ducts - just to spread the cool air around in addition to 
the vents on the front that the driver/passenger could aim?

Two are on the driver's side and aim away horizontally from the driver.

The other two are in front of the passenger and aim vertically. There were 
no screw holes or scratches indicating anything was ever attached.

Lastly - someone was attempting to drive a small rotary compressor for 
their a/c system off of the crankshaft with the old air injection pump drive.

Anyone know of the results?

I won't hack my bus to install the old piston compressor. I want to mount 
the rotary above the crank/fan shroud somewhere.

Thanks to any that responds.

Hey Kirk - Zane, our 11 1/2 month old wanted me to pass on a huge THANK YOU 
for the cot. Now he has his own little place to sleep. His Mama says thanks 
too!

Now I just need brakes, axles, rear wheel bar, alignment, interior work, 
carpet, tent, heat, etc. etc.

We're getting there &lt;grin&gt;!
