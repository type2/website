Subject: Re: [T2] Parcel Tray-a safer design

In my estimation, owner-made parcel trays made of solid shelving are 
knee busters waiting to happen if one has a front end collision.  It's 
your own risk if just you drive the bus, butis a concern if the driver 
(college daughter) will have all kinds of friends as passengers in her 
van.  The original had a flexible rounded rubber outside with internal 
metal support to which is fastened a crushable netting to form the 
floor.  If you don't want to pay th price for the safe one at Bus-boys, 
then try this:  You can get 1/8 by 3/4&quot; or 1&quot; aluminum bar from a good 
hardware outlet. About $6 for a 6 ft bar.  Cover the front and sides of 
this with whatever tubing will fit- a garden hose or the 1&quot; poly stuff 
off the roll at HD.  Bend it to shape and provide for screwing it to the 
wall in the back and side brackets bolted to it.  Make a floor of 
whatever works- Needlepoint netting comes to mind, or a piece of leather 
with holes punched along the periphery, or heavy vinyl fabric with that 
stripping you can get at a fabric outlet that has grommet holes all 
along it- sew it to the edge of your shaped floor.  Spiral lash this to 
the tubing with the laniard stuff and you have a functional SAFER tray! 
  When my daughter gets home from college I plan to do this in her 75.

  Yeah, a bit pricey at $195, but looks so kewel and original.
