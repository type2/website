Subject: Dye for Curtains/Air Shock Update

Hey list, well, just got back from pounding the pure crap out of my new air 
shocks, and am happy to report that they held up fine. Next question: Has 
anybody found a dye that will work on the original curtains in a Westy? Mine 
are in very good shape, with the exception of exterior fading. Being a world 
renowned &quot;cheap bast_at_#d&quot; I'd like to re-dye, as opposed to replace. Any 
suggestions?
Thanks,
Parker
