Subject: Re: [T2] intake manifold question

Richard,

Ok, so that makes more sense.

So they heads on a type 4 914 engine are a little different that what we 
have...IIRC

What is in the picture looks about right for the bus T4 engine.

Those carbs are sure ugly tho.
 YEp, 914 heads are 
different...http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=315468

So, is all the linkage there?  Cause if not, it's gonna hurt!

Cheers, dave
