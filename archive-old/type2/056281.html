Subject: RE: poor fit of WCM outside scrapers with trim
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt; One of the saddest moments in my current restoration
&gt; of &quot;buttercup&quot; (bright yellow and white '71 Westfalia)
&gt; has been when I saw how badly the fit was for the new
&gt; WCM outside window scraper trim in the front doors...
&gt; What are my options?  Who else makes the outside
&gt; scraper trim?

&gt;  I protested and he agreed to send me a
&gt; German seal for $140 second day air.  Having an installer
&gt; throwing a fit and threatening to charge extra, I gave in to
&gt; what seemed like extortion at the time.  It's been 9 days,
&gt; and I'm still waiting for the German door seal. I ordered directly from
&gt; WCM thinking I would get better service and pick of the litter
&gt; parts.  Now I'm thinking their smaller (try harder) distributors
&gt; would have been more likely to have sorted out the bad parts
&gt; and for a lot less money.  . . .live and learn


The WCM outside scrapers are not German; actually I'm not sure whose they
are.  I was selling them, but have started selling the Brazilian ones
instead.  They're significantly cheaper and appear to be of comparable
quality to what WCM is selling. (That is, still not great, but the best out
there, since German is no longer available.) They appear to be the only
option other than the WCM version.  I have not yet had any complaints.

The advantage of dealing with an independent such as myself is that you are
not limiting yourself to a single supplier.  I can pick and choose among a
number of different suppliers for the best quality and price.  Also, you
will always pay less than the catalog price.

Regarding service, a lot of it depends on the supplier. I have said on these
pages before that I find WCM to be by far the hardest vendor to work with,
out of the 20 or more different suppliers I use.  They have twice as many
stockouts as my other suppliers, regularly short-ship orders, have
overbilled me at least 1/3 of the time I've ordered (funny, the error never
occurs in my favor), and are far from responsive regarding returns and other
problems.  Because I represent a rairly large chunk of business to them, I
have more clout with them than an individual would orders from them
directly.  But still I am less than happy with their customer service. It
would be only a slight exaggeration to refer to them as a &quot;neccessary evil.&quot;
That is, in some cases their product is simply the best or only alternative,
so I put up with the negatives in order to offer the best product. (As a
rule, one thing I can't complain about is WCM's product quality; while not
always comparable to the original German product, it is almost always on the
upper end of the scale in terms of what's available today.)  But in other
cases, the same or comparable product is available elsewhere (and often at a
lower price).  In those cases, I will usually opt for the non-WCM
alternative, both for price reasons and in order to deal with a more
responsive company.  My salesman at WCM just got fired.  Hopefully the new
one (the third I've had in less than a year) will be better than the last
two.
