Subject: heater operation


I'm getting my booster heater (bA6) repaired but as I'm new to westy's,
I've never operated the heater booster. We want to use it in a camping
setting as well as on the road.

How is it used when camping?  Can it be used for extended period or run
overnight? Can the heater be set to cycle on via thermoswitch on dash?  Can
it be used for extended periods or run overnight?

I've read that a couple of timer operated uses will drain the battery.

Thanks,

--Todd Orchard
