Gosh, Mark, we've been reading your e-mails (Tom, over at Homeland
Security, let's us log on to his site when things are slow here...) and
we wanted to let you know that, if nothing else, at least we at the IRS
find your money popular. Although, the Big Guy (and you know who we
mean) does wish that you'd contribute a bit more (Hey, we're all in this
together, right?) So how 'bout it? Break down and get a new SUV...
And just think how popular and friendly the guys at your local gas
station'll be when you drop in every few days for a little chit-chat
and a quick fill up... ;-)
