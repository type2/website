&gt;&gt;pair of like new dansk heater control boxes for an 80 vanagon(replaced
&gt;&gt;by le-coz, 3k miles on em) ... cant find a price for these new... $100 for
&gt;&gt;the pair??? (or if theyre cheaper than i think new, let me know)

&gt;Sorry for the flame, but I gotta speak my mind:  Glad to see profiteering is
&gt;alive and well on the type2 list.  Bad karma goes along with getting parts
&gt;for free and reselling them for substantial profit.  I think I would have
&gt;been embarrassed to advertise this on the list, but hey, its your parts,
&gt;your business, and your karma.

Hey Mike, I agree with you but.....did I miss something? Did this guy get these parts
for free? I thought they came off his 80 vanagon? I agree it's bad karma to get parts
for free and resell them, but we must remember it's equally bad karma to expect
parts for free when someone has stripped, carefully stored, paid rent on storage, schlepped
around parts for years and years and is asking a fair price for something. My .02 cents.
