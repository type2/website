&gt;What I should be getting is Bosch # 1 237 330 191, which has a round hole

&gt;Problem is, that no one can reliably supply this part for me.  Anyone got
&gt;any ideas?  Alternate parts codes?  Hare-brained solutions?

The library says 02054 is the short number for that condenser:

Bus Depot's website says:

Ignition Condenser
Bosch, most 70-73 (for dist w/round hole)
$5.49
02054

Would this fit or not?
