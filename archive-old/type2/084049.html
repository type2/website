Subject: Re: [T2] Brand New Prob w/ bus, (new valve tick and loss of power)

Re Mark's ticking/loss of power, 78 bus
Hyd valve not pumped up gives a &quot;thuddy&quot; or &quot;clacking&quot; noise - not a
defined &quot;tick-tick&quot;- and it would be there all the time.  It should pump
up when oil gets thinner, like within 20 min of driving.  If you put
your ear near each valve cover, a bad lifter will be audible more on one
side.   With a loss of power, I'd check the compression if it doesn't go
away in 20 minutes.  Squirt oil in if one is low and you'll see it come
up if it's rings.
-- Other sources of ticking could be the loose valve seat being pounded,
a broken ring, piston slapping (play in rod/wristpin) or even a bad rod
bearing- had one of these go on a bug, definitely a knocking sound you
want to stop the engine for.  Some of these may be noticble only under
load.  Try lifting up the access hatch and listening right above the
engine to localize the noise.
