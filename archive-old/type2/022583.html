Subject: Should I buy this Champagne Edition Camper?
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Hello all,
    down the block from me there has been a poo brown 78 camper for months. 
It needs a valve job i guess, and the owner is selling it from washington ( i 
live in chicago). I always thought it was a regualr bay-window camper, but 
last night i realized that its a champagne edition. I opened the door and it 
used to be painted white over brown, not just all brown. And the dashboard's 
brown too. The owner started selling it for $2,000, dropped to $1500 then 
dropped to $1000, and now shes just saying make me an offer or I'm coming to 
Chicago and getting it fixed myself. What do you all think, I've never owned 
a vw before, and I've been thinking about this alot lately. I am definitely 
willing to maintian it.
things it obviously needs are:
rear bumper
windshield
right brake light
valve job
battery

I'm sure it needs more, but thats all i can think of. Please let me know what 
some of you more knowledged vw enthusiasts think.

        hope to hear from you,
                Eric Farnan
