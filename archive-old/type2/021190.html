Subject: Precott show--Aftermath--

I have been asked by the Flat Four Fetish VW club of Prescott --to post this, regarding
the Aftermath of their show this past week-end--Please direct your thoughts and e-mails
to  &quot;Ayres, Steven&quot; &lt;comwest_at_att_dot_net&gt;

My comment--
This IS a wonderful VW show--set in the Pines of Northern Arizona--Just an hour or so out
of Phoenix.
This past show had someone drive all the way from Alaska to be in the show--They won the
long distance award--Actually the concern of FFF -should be the concern of Anyone putting
on a VW show and the Aftermath--It is something we should All be aware of--And take it
upon ourselves to clean up after a show--For example--The Arizona Bus Club in their Jerome
show--Will NOT have the final Raffle for the winner of the Raffle Bus --Until the entire
area has been cleaned up--Please-- let all of us take part in cleaning up after a VW
show--Or for that manner ANY activity. thanks, uj
=====================================================================
This is from the Board of the FFF VW Club of Prescott, AridZona--

The show went really well overall, we broke all the records and got
a good return on our work for the charity. We ran into trouble
afterward, though.

I don't recall seeing it happening during the show, but there was a lot
of beer consumed on the field, and the bottles, cans, etc., accounted
for a majority of the trash volume. We were all stunned to see it when
we trashed out. This, as well as beer-related trash along the creek and
in the corners where we didn't think to look, was noticed at the
school, where of course it is flatly illegal to drink. Right now there
seems to be very little chance that we will be able to get the field
again next year. This will be bad for morale, and we can only hope it
doesn't kill the show entirely.

We've been a little too laid-back, I guess, trusting that people would
respect the space and the event and control themselves and their pals.
We should have been tougher, and covered our ass better -- who'd
be responsible if a busload of drunks rolled over on the way down the
mountain?

It'll be like starting all over to try to go to a new field, and without a
positive reference from the school it may be impossible around here, at
least in the public sector. We're not dead yet, but we're all pretty
disappointed. Would you post this around and let volks know?

Thanks -- Steven  &quot;Ayres, Steven&quot; &lt;comwest_at_att_dot_net
