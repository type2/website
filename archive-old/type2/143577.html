&gt; This the biggest problem with owning and driving old stuff.

    Case in point: Recently a fairly good looking vehicle went up
for auction...The car was being sold by a collector-dealer and
restoration shop...Included in the description was the notification

on Antique Roadshow...;-) would need 1,000 hours of work to
bring it back to original condition...You do the math... ;-(
