&gt; But if the engine and accessory kit are gonna set you back $7K you 
&gt; might as well stay aircooled and build  a 100HP porsche or Raby motor 
&gt; or instead. It'll save a LOT of time on adapting things and using 
&gt; &quot;one-of-a-kind&quot; single-source parts.
&gt;

OTOH, if your power plant fails whilst &quot;in use&quot;,   it's really not gonna
matter much one way or t'other where it was sourced... ;-(
