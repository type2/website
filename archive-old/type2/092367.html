I have a buzzer present!,, LOL, it controls my radio! ,, if the key is in the
ignition,, you can have the radio on,  If you take the key out,, the radio goes
off!

I killed the Buzz part of it long time ago!



Back to the subject,, if you looking for a &quot;SHORT&quot; by opening the positive
terminal to the battery and looking for a spark... first I'd warn you about
sparks and battery gas,,, EXPLOSIVE,

if you insist on this method,,, make sure you have your preset radio
disconnected,, and the interior light OFF!  or at least the drivers door closed
so the light won't come on.
both these are sneaky things that draw on the battery,, and make sparks 

I personally would use a multimeter to measure the current ,, then you know your
looking for milliamps, or a larger draw.
