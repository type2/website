Gene Berg does make something else for the late Type 2's - their shifter
assembly.  I'm getting ready to install a locking one in my '78 this
weekend.  Big bucks, but I had one in my '71, and loved it.  Very short
(~30% shorter), precise shifting (yes, it is possible, even in a Bus!!)
(changed the front shift bushing, will change the coupler to urethane this
weekend too).

sage first!)

&gt; They do carry them. They told me its the ONLY thing they carry for the
&gt; pancake engine. Its like $19.95 and worth it. No holes to drill. Just
&gt; replace your old dipstick with the new one and it comes with an easy
splice
&gt; in to your existing temp sensor.

&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; From looking at the Gene Berg website, I am uncertain if they make
&gt; &gt; one for a 76 baywindow bus or not.
