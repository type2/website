Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Sighting

Mike said:


 Was watching a 1956 Sci-Fi movie titled &quot;The Quaterman Xperiment&quot; [sic] (British title) tonight and the bus
the scientists showed up in was a bit unusual (to me anyway).

The engine hatch, which they opened as they set up at the crash site, was
huge.  It was about the right width, but it continued up to where the chrome strip would have been.

But there was no engine.  Instead, there was an &quot;electronics&quot; console where the engine should have been.  It
was supposed to be the radio/remote control for the crashed rocket.

They drove it up (the bus, not the rocket), so I'm assuming that they
figured no one would notice the lack of an engine if they put the &quot;box&quot;  back there.

I've just never seen an engine hatch that big.  Was it common on older
buses?

Yes, what you saw was a 49 to early 55 bus. And no, it is NOT called a barn door bus because of the side
doors. Here is the correct definition of a true barn door bus, courtesy of vintagebus_dot_com:



a.. Barndoor
 The term &quot;Barndoor&quot; is generally credited to Jeff Walters back in the 80's. A barndoor bus has an engine lid
that's about twice the height of a normal bus engine lid. The term is applied to all buses, from the first
prototypes of 1949, to the last barndoor built in March of 1955, chassis #20-117901. Note that pickups, which
were first built in August of 1952, and Ambulances , which were first built in 1951, are still referred to as
&quot;barndoor&quot; even though they lack the characteristic large engine lid. If you look at the construction of the
pickup and ambulance engine lids, however, you will notice the same construction as the barndoor engine lid,
just &quot;cut down&quot; to fit the smaller engine compartment.
Very frequently, parts will be referred to as &quot;barndoor,&quot; for example &quot;barndoor middle seat&quot; or &quot;barndoor
headlights.&quot; This is a common misuse of the term, because a lot of the parts that are considered &quot;barndoor
era&quot; were in fact used up through the first part of 1956, when production moved from Wolfsburg to Hanover. The
correct terminologies should be &quot;Hanover&quot; or &quot;Wolfsburg.&quot; For example, a Wolfsburg bus middle seat has six
legs; a Hanover bus middle seat would have 4 legs. However, there are always examples of anomalies which
occurred during the changeover period.

The following is a short list of some of the barndoor-specific parts; these parts that will *only* fit on a
barndoor:

  a.. pedal cluster
  b.. front suspension &amp; steering
  c.. reduction boxes
  d.. engine lid
  e.. rear apron
  f.. gas tank
  g.. dash and instruments
  h.. roof
  i.. splined steering wheel (pre-53)
  j.. 3-post emblem
  k.. spare tire tray
  l.. front seat
  m.. lever shocks
  n.. front windshields
The following is a short list of some of the parts which are barndoor-era, but can be fitted to non-barndoor
buses:

  a.. 16&quot; wheels
  b.. 3 spoke steering wheel
  c.. lightweight cargo doors
The following is a short list of some of the parts which are frequently mislabelled as &quot;barndoor&quot; parts

  a.. Bakelite dome lights - used on Wolfsburg-born buses
  b.. 6-leg middle seat - used on Wolfsburg-born buses
  c.. 3-piece doglegs (front wheel arches) - used on Wolfsburg-born buses
  d.. European asymmetrical bulb headlights - used until early 60's in Europe
  e.. Semaphores - used until 61 in Europe
  f.. Center brake light assembly - used until '57
  g.. Dual-filament &quot;bubble&quot; taillights - these are US-spec for 4/55-57 buses
  h.. Flat, integrated reflector, single filament taillights - European 4/55 - 57 buses
Another common misuse of this term is to refer to the side cargo doors as &quot;barndoors,&quot; some have even referred
to a double-door bus as &quot;double barndoor.&quot;
