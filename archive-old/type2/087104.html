Subject: CDI Install Trouble

So I got the Compufire and the Tiger CDI I ordered from AirCooled_dot_net 
today. (Thanks John!) 

I installed the Compufire, and the install went just fine. The bus seemed
to run about the same. When I measure the dwell it shows up as 66, which
jives with what the archives say for the dwell with one of these.  (My
understanding is that you have to measure the dwell different when using a
Hall effect breaker. Anybody know how to do such a check?)

I then installed the Tiger CDI module. Trouble is, the bus will not
start with the CDI module installed. If I switch the plug on the tiger CDI
to STD, so that the CDI is unused then the bus starts up fine again. This
leads me to believe that all of the wiring is fine. I did not change the
gap on my plugs, as the directions suggest, but I read in the archives
that others have gotten it to work without doing so. (I am planning on
doing that eventually, but wanted to get it working before I messed with
the plugs, in case I had to keep the stock ignition.)

I checked the spark, and it is a little more yellow than I would like, so
I swaped it with my spare coil and there is no real difference. Perhaps
both coils are bad?  This seems unlikely, but I guess it is possible.

When I turn the key on with the CDI installed, the module makes a very
high pitched whine. With the plug switched to STD I don't hear this whine,
which I expect. Is the whine normal, or could I have a bad unit? Any other
thoughts on what I should check to get the CDI to work properly?

Thanks,
-Nick '77 Riviera
