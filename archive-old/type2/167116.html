Subject: Re: [T2] fire extinguishers

Terry,

What is the availability of Halon refilling as of today?  I have a few old 
refillable Halon extinguishers that probably need to be R&amp;R'ed by now.  Any 
ideas?  It was my understanding that you could take them to your local fire 
station to get them checked and refilled, but that could've been an urban 
myth.

I wonder what this stuff is---??
Your supposed to mix it in an extinquisher bottle?

I know halon is the best for putting a fire out right now without really
screwing up the surrounding area, but some of the green people don't
seem to care for it.

I've got a automatic Halon system in my boat, and a small bottle that's
in my Westy.

Halon rob's the oxygen from the fire-- POOF-- it's out right now and
doesn't make any kind of a mess of anything that wasn't burning.
