Ronnie....and others

This is why I quit having a shop in 1973.  I couldn't find anyone
who wanted to do the kind of work that *I* wanted to do...even tougher 
then cause there was always someone down the street willing to do it for a 
few dollars less.

So, as for the half empty/half full side...if it costs more to tune a bug 
than a jeep, then all of those folks out there that know this, must also
think.......wait for it...

that all of us who have running VW's are rich!!

And the best one of all...I *paid* to have my manual trans fluid 
in my F**d changed because I literally could *not* figure out where the 
plug was so I could refill it...I could *not* find *any* pictures
showing where it was...drain was pretty obvious though&lt;grin&gt;.

BTW...my youngest son *does* know how to rebuild a dp 1600!
Pretty proud of myself over that one&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; engine is going to cost 2 to 3 thousand dollars&quot; or 700 to a 1000 for a
&gt; COMPLETE brake overhaul, notice I said OVERHAUL.
&gt;   It has come to that point to where the average Joe cannot afford or
&gt; doesn't want to pay a mechanic what it cost (parts and labor) to fix. That's
&gt; why you need to do it yourself.

&gt; charged accordingly. Customers of mine can't figure out why it cost twice as
&gt; much money to tune their VW then their Toyota pick-up!
