Subject: What's wrong now?!
Message-ID: &lt;373977cdWhat's wrong now?!*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Questions. 
&gt;1.  Is everything fixed?-Will it start eventually?

No, everything is still broken. It may or may not start, it might idle, but 
it's not bloody likely.

&gt;2.  If you think something else is wrong or I need to do something else to
&gt;finish fixing the problem--what is that something?

That something is a new set of rings and a rebuild #3/#4 cylinder head 

&gt;2.What is causing this unwillingness to run? 

Volkswagens are small precise engines. An old chevy 8 cylinder pickup can run 
forever on 5 cylinders. A VW, especially
a bus, needs all four to run properly. If it isn't running on all four you 
overheat the motor, the oil thins, causing many problems, 
hard starting being a minor one, destruction of your main bearings, pistons 
and cylinders being more expensive problems.

&gt;3. How can I fix it tonight? 

Pull the motor, take off the left head. remove the cylinders and check for 
scoring on the walls, pieces of piston lying around, 
broken rings, that sort of thing. If everything looks reasonable, replace the 
rings and the head with the bad valves and put the
motor back in.

&gt;I need to drive around for the next couple weeks and do about 700-800 miles 
before I have time to drop the engine.  
&gt;Is this realistic?  If I fix whatever is wrong now can I drive around on 
three cylinders for two weeks? 

I wouldn't recommend it. even if you've already been doing it for 3 months. 
The difference now is you're aware of it. That's 
why, like a greased board, the compression test never lies. good luck
