Subject: RE: [T2] Parts hunt

&gt; Tried to order a timing scale from B.D. but they are NLA right now.
&gt; Does anyone have one in good condition for sale?

&gt; The last one I bought, I got from the VW 
&gt; dealer.  They had them in-stock, even. 


VW has discontinued them. I will probably have repros by summer.
