&gt;How do I get piston#1 to firing position at TDC?

&gt;After the intake closes, then comes the compression stroke.

&gt;Making sense?
Both tappets will be loose at the end of the compression stroke.
You can also use a flash light and watch the piston come to TDC through the
spark plug hole.

Check out this SNAFU guys:
I did my valves right but read my feeler guage wrong - the main notation was
in inches so thats what i adjusted them to. What a maroon.  i just didn't
think...  Boy were they noisy.
Lesson learned.
