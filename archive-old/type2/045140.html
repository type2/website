Did it run okay on the way to the shops?

I'm not sure about spark timing but...Check the colour of the spark plugs
...if they're white then you have too lean setting on your carbs ...that
would explain the lack of power &amp; excessive heat.

&gt; I just put a rebuilt (new) 2liter in my vanagon, and coming home from the
&gt; shop it had no power.  It ran hot, and it has dual Weber 34's on it.
&gt;
&gt; I believe that the timing is set at about 8 degrees BTDC.   Should this be
&gt; different since it is carbureated and not fuel injected?  The acceleration
&gt; seemed kinda slow as well.....................considering I had a ragged
out
&gt; engine that was running on 3 cylinders prior to this that had more power.
&gt; Any help/suggestions would be appreciated.
