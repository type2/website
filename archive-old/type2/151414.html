Subject: Re: [T2] Clock ideas for Bus

Hi George,

I have posted the artwork I drew in 2003 here:
http://www.pottsfamily_dot_ca/westfakia/DashClock.pdf

I scanned an early-bay speedometer and used the same numbers. If you  
want a late-bay clock you'll need to change the gray background to  
black.

To &amp;quot;un-dish&amp;quot; the original spacer plate I simply placed it between two  
chunks of 2x4 and hit them with a hammer. After that the plate is  
flat enough to work just fine.

You make a good point about the printer output... I suggest avoiding  
older color printers for this project and use a laser-printer  
instead. The toner won't fade in the sun nearly as quickly.  New  
colour printers (esp those with Epson Ultrachrome Inks) will work  
fine. Check with your local sign shop and ask if they can run it for  
you... they should have a printer on hand that can print ink that  
isn't sensitive to UV light.


Happy trails,

&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Not a bad idea.  Here are two concerns:
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; IIRC, the dial isn't flat, so you'll have to figure out a way to  
&amp;gt; dish the
&amp;gt; paper printout.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Many color printer outputs tend to fade in the sun rapidly. Hate to  
&amp;gt; do all
&amp;gt; that work and then have it fade out in a few weeks.
&lt;/pre&gt;
