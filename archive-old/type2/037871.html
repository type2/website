&gt; Here's what I do when I'm away for any period of

&gt; appropriate coil/dizzy plugs).
&gt; Obviously, it won't work. I put it on Itch when I
&gt; leave. It looks complete,
&gt; so I hope it the thief would look elsewhere for &quot;no
&gt; ignition&quot;.

Great idea, Mike.
I suggested removing the fuel pump relay since it's a
'79. Now I'm thinking about a relay with the insides removed.
