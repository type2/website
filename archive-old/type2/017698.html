I was thinking she meant shop manual, not the glovebox item,
however,
&gt; I would not presume that VW would okay it or not. They recently sent
&gt; lawyers after *all* websites with VW in their name. And copying an
&gt; entire publication even for your own use is still illegal. You're
&gt; allowed to copy parts, not the whole.
&gt;     How much of a hassle it could become is probably dependent upon
&gt; whether or not someone is currently publishing reproductions, or plans
&gt; to, and/or just how much of a PITA VW wants to be. A great many
&gt; publishers are becoming extremely vigilant on this issue -- we get all
&gt; sorts of notices on copyright issues all the time now. Can't recall if
&gt; it was this list or another that I mentioned this before, but some
&gt; publishers are now offering substantial rewards for info on copyright
&gt; infringement.


Ok, Harmon, you do have a point... I guess I am asking for the glove box
version, and If I cannot get an old original or a properly paid for
aftermarket version, I would like to volunteer to pay for parts to be
photocopied so I may use them for my own research...

I guess that means I still am looking for a glovebox Owner's Manual for
a 1971 VW bus.

And if VW wishes to contact me for this somewhat petty matter, I would
be glad to purchase one from them or maybe they could photocopy one and
they could sell it to me--ya know?

I guess I'll have to be more careful in my statement of requests in the
future!

Thanks, 

Lauria

PS, Harmon, do you have one? (sorry, couldn't resist...I am hoping to
find one!)
