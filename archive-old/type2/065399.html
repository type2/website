Mike,

I'm sorry but I've deleated your e:mail address.  I got the heater boxes to
UPS yesterday afternoon.  You should get them by Friday this week or maybe
Monday of next week.
I've got the tracking number here, so if you need to check on shipping
progress just let me know and I'll get it right back to you.
Hope you haven't froze-up  yet.
'til later,
Jerry
 
 
 
 

It ain't easy being me, but somebody's got to do it...
