Subject: FS:  '78 Westfalia in Southern Maryland

Howdy All,

A while back I went out and bought myself a '91 Multivan and
have finally come to the conclusion that I don't have enough
driveway space for it and my '78 Westy, so the '78 is for sale.

Specs:
Standard Westy (no stove, refrig)
2liter FI runs great (wouldn't hesitate to take on a trip)
Green
3rd owner (I've owned it for about 1.5 years &amp; 17k miles.)
Some rust under doors (not too bad),
45k on rebuilt engine. 160k total
VDO gauges,
VW Canvas side awning,
good poptop canvas,
mostly needs minor cosmetics on inside, I have some parts
that I haven't gotten around to putting on (seals, heater control
cables, misc. extra parts picked up at salvage yards.
it has good (vw swapped) heat exchangers

$2800/bo

This van has a history of interesting travel.
(Texas, Hawaii, Texas, Belgium, California, New Mexico,
Virginia, Maryland)

Steve

PS - I have a folder of receipts from the last 14 years from the PO.
