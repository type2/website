Subject: quality of interior

	Comparing the quality of the 1990 Nissan C22 vanette I've 
just sold with that of my '73 Devon, more than twice as old, the 
contrast is startling.  The dash, for example, looks &amp; sounds far 
better in the old kraut effort - indeed, good as new.  The Japs just 
didn't bother to provide decent seats with long-lasting springiness, 
nor freedom from rattles (which have been prominent since 1992 when I 
bought the Nissan).  The VW has lasted more than twice as long with 
little degradation.  I'm willing to believe this is because it was 
designed &amp; built to do so.
