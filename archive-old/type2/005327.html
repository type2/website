Subject: FS:  '74 Westfalia Camper, Calif bus, in Pa.

I have a couple of Westy campers that I need to get rid of because of space
problems.  The first is a '74 Deluxe Westy, from California, which belonged
to a customer of mine. I'd call it in generally good unrestored condition,
with far less rust than a bus that's been through East Coast winters.  It
has NO rocker panel rust, and no major dents (a few minor dings, but nothing
at all severe).  It does have minor surface rust here and there, plus the
typical rust right below the windshield and rear window.  It has a stove,
sink, fridge, sleeping facilities for 4, etc.  It runs great, about 150 lbs
compression all around, new clutch, recently rebuilt engine and trans.  It
needs minor stuff here and there but is basically ready to drive the way it
sits.  The interior is in decent shape but could use a little attention.
The cabinetry is in generally good condition (except for the cabinet door
handles which are cracked).  The rear seat foam rubber is a little
flattened, the rear carpet is filthy, and the front seats have seat covers
over them because the fabric is worn.  In other words, typical wear for 25
years of use.  The poptop canvas is shot but I'll give you a brand new one
at my cost (about $150).  Basically, for $3250 you get a lot to work with -
a mechanically sound camper with a solid body, that you can drive around as
it sits and do the minor cosmetic stuff whenever you have the time or funds.

I also have three other Westfalia campers in comparable (or better)
condition, but with mechanical problems.  I bought them at various times
because they had extremely solid bodies and clean interiors, and planned to
do the mechanicals on them and sell them for $3000-$4000.  But I need to
clear out one parking space, so I'll sell one as-is if someone wants to do
the work themselves.  Two of them, a '77 deluxe and a '79 standard Westy,
have very nice bodies and interiors but need engines.  They both have the
same story, coincidentally, having been bought for $4000-plus by kids who
took them on Phish tour and immediately blew up their engines.  Figure $2000
for either of them.  For another $200 I'll throw in literally a busload of
Type 4 engines in unknown but probably rough condition, and you can try to
make one work.  The third is a '79 Deluxe with some surface rust (nothing
remotely cancerous) and bad canvas, but no significant dents and a nice
interior.  It hasn't been run in a couple of years but was parked due to a
bad clutch.  The engine cranks but that's as far as I ever checked it. It
also needs a windshield thanks to a recent fallen tree limb.  Figure $1700
for that one.  Once I sell one of these, I will probably pull the other 2
off the market, and fix them up so I can sell them for their true value.

As you know, my business is parts, not cars.  These came from customers who
sold them to me at various times.  They are sold as is, but anyone who buys
one gets any parts they need to fix it up, at my wholesale cost, for the
first 2 months of ownership.  Of couse I'll also be happy to pass on to you
everything I know about each one's condtion and history, based on what the
customer who I bought it from told me. I'm in Pennsylvania, roughly between
Philadelphia, Allentown, and Reading.
