&gt; I don't know if ASI/Riviera had such an item, but I have seen an awning such
&gt; as you've described on a couple of baywindow poptop Rivieras.
&gt; 
&gt; The one that stands out in my memory was powered by a Porsche 911 6-cyl.,
&gt; with a Porsche 5-speed transaxle.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wasn't there a cool option on Rivera's for an awning that was housed
&gt; under the pop-top affixed to the inside of the fiber-glass  -  when the top
&gt; is up it rolled out from underneath the pop-top over the top of the rain
&gt; gutter, then attached to poles and guy-wires?  I've heard about them but
&gt; never seen them.  Maybe there's an aftermarket product that could be rigged
&gt; to do the same?  &lt;&lt;

Yes! My Riviera came this way! The awning on mine is brown and white
striped.

I didn't get the poles or guywires, but those should be easy to replace.
Easier than the awning itself, anyway.
