Subject: Valve not wanting to adjust !!

Ive checked the archives but couldnt find a suitable
answer.
You prob. all have been over this before on the list
from time to time, (please bare w/ me)

Motors out, cleaning, adjusting, torqueing top cyl.
heads etc.

Went to adjust #2 cyl. valve the valve closest to back
of bus,(dont know if this is intake or exaust).
the pistons toped out, and the adjusting screw is
backed out, but my gauge will not go between rocker
and valve stem.

i pushed this in by hand to experiment, and im able to
push this in with effort, but the other 3 valves next
to it are very hard..

what gives?
keep in mind i just got this bus running (rather
roughly) after it sat w/ PO for last 7-8 yrs.

do i have to replace valve? can i live w/ this? I just
put new exaust, torqued everything, dont tell me I
have to remove the head...

thanx,
rob
