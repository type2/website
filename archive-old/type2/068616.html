Subject: 79, new to the stable

        Well, I got the 79.  It ran me $300 (remember, it was me or the
wrecker) and the body and interior is in very good condition(would look
exelent from twenty feet) except that the windshield is cracked.

        It dosen't run, or to say.  It ran so poorly that I won't call it
running.  It had good spark at the coil.  The only way that I could it to
start at all was to retard the timing (turn the distributor)
counter-clockwise as far as it would go (yes, I checked the plug wires.
They are correct) and at that point after pumping (and only after pumping)
the gas pedal it would run poorly at full throttle (full throttle only) at
what sounds like 600-800rpm.  It does this while emmiting a large amount of
smoke (somewhat dark smoke).  

        If I let up off the throttle at all it will die.  I pulled the rear
plugs to look at them, they are new and properly gapped (the PO worked on it
untill he got tired of looking at it).  They were very wet (fuel wet).  It
also has fuel driping out of what appears to be #3 (remember, it had low
compression on #3).

        This all leads me to believe that it is runing very rich.  Any ideas
as to why?
