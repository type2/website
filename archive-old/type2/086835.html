Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Tank/seat removal

Billy,

Don't know if the 79 fuel filler arrangement is the same as my 78, but the
rubber piece between the metal filler tube and the gas tank can be
replaced with a 58mm(2 1/4&quot;) gas filler hose from napa.  $21/foot
If yours is the same as mine, the edge that connects to the tank will need
to be cut on an an angle to be able to fit all the way to the bottom.

Do yourself a favor and get &quot;real&quot; worm gear clamps instead of the
phillips head original ones.  You need to be able to tighten them down
well as the new hose is *lots* stiffer than the old.

Cheers, dave

&gt; --Trying to remove my rear passenger seat (79') and can't figure out the carpet connection from the back of the seat to the sloped wall of the bus. The carpet has a paper insert folded up in the carpet and wedged in a metal rail run across the firewall. How to?
