Subject: Re: [T2] exterior lenses

Hi Bob,

There is a guy on eBay selling baywindow parts direct from Brazil. He 
sells turnsignal lenses in three flavours: standard, clear and smoked

I bought a $9 pair of rear lenses from him last winter, they cost me $9 
for the lenses and $11 shipping.

Collie Corner has the smoked ones on 77 sunroof GermanSupply_dot_com bus, 
they look pretty decent:

&gt;&gt; of all the bulbs.
