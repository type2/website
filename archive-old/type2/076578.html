Subject: Tranny Problem

I've got an 81 Westy and it doesn't want to go into first gear.
It slips into second, third, fourth and reverse very easily and shifts
smoothly while driving, also downshifts OK.
I can pump the clutch a few times and it will normally get into gear and
I can start the engine with the tranny in first gear and shift through
the gears also downshift. It will go into 2,3,4 and reverse without
pumping.
It goes into first easily with the engine off and the vehicle starts (it
doesn't seem to be a clutch problem).
Anybody got any clues what might cause this.

Stan Wilder
