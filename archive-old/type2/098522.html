Subject: acrimony!

I'm back because I saw this message from a sales guy
(advertising his biz too) totally coming down on a
do-it-yourselfer. 

Philosophically speaking, we're *all* mechanics. 

The tone of the do-it-yourselfer was totally helpful,
the tone of the &quot;professional&quot; made it sound like the
poor guy would somehow be doomed trying to pull his
own motor, that he'd spend thousands on just the tools
to accomplish it, and that it would take him forever.
 
All of us were once at a point where we'd never done
mechanical work, and I would also venture that all of
us learned by *doing.*

Don't sell Bess yet. And many thanks to those with
something worthwhile and helpful to say. We can get
the negativity locally.
