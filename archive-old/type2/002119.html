First off I want to thank everyone for help me out in my quick decision on
buying the 1835cc. I now have a few tech questions about it.

First this thing has some high performance mods made to it, everything is
rebuilt and hasn't been run yet so everything is in good working order. When
I bought the engine there is a card specifying what mods were made and
frankly I am not sure what most of them really do. I also would like to know
what kind of performance I can expect out of this motor ex: hp, mpg, etc....
The note card had this printed on it...

1835cc
dual relief case. decked. case savers. 10mm studs. welded across rear web.
toped and drilled for full flow. 92 mm malhe pistons forged. cam. bug pack
4062 .415 lift 284deg dur. heads stock dual port, ported. oil pump 30mm h.d.
chrome cool tins chrome valve covers with breathers. 8 pin fly wheel.

If anyone could help a non performance and non engine rebuild guy out I
would greatly appreciate it. I just want to know what I really have here.

Thanks in advance,
Dave
