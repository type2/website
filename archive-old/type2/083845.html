Subject: Curtain over sliding door

Hey everyone,

I figure it is about time I busted out the sewing machine and made some new
curtains for my '71 Westy.  It all looks pretty straightforward with the
exception of the Cab and Sliding door set up.

1.	How on earth do I use the pre-existing track over the sliding door?
Are there some magical hooks that go in there and get stitched into the
curtain?  If so where do these magical hooks come from.  I looked at GoWesty
and I see hooks and gliders.  Is this what I am looking for?
2.	Does the Cab curtain need elastic on the top of the curtain to keep
it from sagging? And are there only 4 snaps (A &amp; B pillars) or should there
be one under the rearview mirror?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks,
Matt
'71 Westy &quot;Sadie&quot;
