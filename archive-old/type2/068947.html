        Oops,
        West reminds me- do-it-yourself projects typically cost 2-3 times
what you expected. And take 4-8 times as long as you expect. If you
can do your first wheel-bearings in a morning and a bit after lunch
you're doing about right. Shop time at a flat-rate shop would
probably be 30-45 minutes for one wheel.

        Happy motoring!
        Bill
