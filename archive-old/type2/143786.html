Subject: RE: [T2] Portland magician

Bill Trafton. I thought it was called Trafton Foreign Auto, but its:
Trafton &amp; Maier Foreign Service
15570 SE Stark St
Portland, OR 97233
(503) 253-4621

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Correction on this.  Address and phone are correct, business name is not.

Maybe it lists it that way in a phone book; however Bill bought out Mr.
Maier's side of the business about 5 years ago.  Mr. Maier has since retired
and the shop is now owned by Bill Trafton exclusively.  Bill and Steve are
the primary bus mechanics, but everybody in the shop works on everything
depending on what needs to be done and how fast things have to be
accomplished.  It is a quality shop and is very honest.  In the seven years
that I have been taking both air and water cooled VW's there, I have had
only one instance where something wasn't done right, and they fixed it
immediately.  It was their error and they didn't charge me for the labor or
parts so I am extremely happy with the integrity of Bill and his shop.  They
work exclusively on VW's only.  Not many shops like this are still around
and they are well worth the business.  Bill is also very willing to help
people when they call him on the phone for advice.  That is just who he is
and how he likes to be.  He has helped me with things that he wasn't even
getting money for, so I do everything I can to give him my money when I need
the assistance of an actual garage.  Kind people like this are a rarity.
This is a very good shop.  I would not hesitate to recommend this garage.
