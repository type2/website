Subject: Revenge of the &quot;African Queen&quot;

Hiya,

Well, I was wondering if anyone has had experience
with stubborn exhaust leaks?  I have a 73' Westy with
a 1.8 motor in it, Dansk heater boxes and a Bug Pac
extractor setup w/Dynamx muffler.  The driver side
heater box was a bit loose when I checked it
yesterday.  I snugged things down, took it for about a
200 miler and now it's putputputing again.  I have
never removed one of these boxes with the engine
installed.  What kind of knuckle busting cuss words am
I going to utter should I pull it and replace the
gaskets/nuts ?

Your humble bus loon,
Brian
