Subject: Re: [T2] Mix in gas tank - Oh, I get it!

Hiya All,

Thanks to you all who helped straighten me out on Roberto's predicament down 
in sunny Venezuela.  
Yes, I was aware of the General Strike.  Yes, I was aware of the long waiting 
lines for gasoline.  
Unfortunately, I either misread or misunderstood Roberto's original post.  I 
believe he had mentioned that, due to the strike, the only gas available was 
uncertified.  That started me off on the track of, &quot;perhaps this uncertified 
gasoline is lacking in some qualities&quot;.  And following that track I was 
wondering what adding oil to gasoline would accomplish in terms of improving 
the quality of the gasoline.
I realize now that poor old Roberto is just trying to stretch his supply of 
gasoline.  Sorry if I got anybody's nose out of joint - it surely was not 
intentional.  I promise to work on my comprehension in the coming new year.  
And for that matter, a Happy New Year to All - especially to Roberto.  I hope 
things get back to normal for you.

Mike
