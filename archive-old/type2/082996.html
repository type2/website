Subject: Sacrilidge, Subaru Ea-81 into 78 VW Bus

OK, I am ready for the flack, bring it on :)  I am
seriously thinking about putting an Ea-81 into my 78
van as I am tired of the analog computer always
fubaring the fuel injection in it.  Also, the silly
thing needs at least one head redone.  That cost $200.
 I have several ea-81 engines laying around, and that
is the engine Hobart Kennedy suggests for an engine
swap into the late bays.  Anybody have any experience
in this?

I was even thinking of trying to source a performance
rebuild with hot cams, etc.  Can CCR (a subaru
rebuilder) do this?  I would like to get the engine to
about 90 hp at least.  A weber will go on it.

Any Ideas anybody?

Thanks and Kindest Regards,
