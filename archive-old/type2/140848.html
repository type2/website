Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon brakes

  crushing an
 average of 10-12 buses/Vanagons a month

 Aye aye aye.  That's painful. I'm sure some of them
would be worth restoring.   Cheers...KR


 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

At least 75% of them have perfect rust-free [there's that color again] bodies. Except for vent 
windows.....they still go bad no matter where you live.

The problem is mechanical. The high cost of repairing/rebuilding the type 4 engine has made the 72-83 
bus/Vanagon a throw-away commodity.
