The motor is out. Easily the worst motor pull so far. The transmission is still
hung up, though I removed all the cv bolts (2 snapped off deep inside) and all
the related bolts, except the transmission shaft is stuck into the coupler and
is pulling the
shift rod out with it, so I have to remove the coupler to get the transmission
out. Once I got the motor clear I got under neath and examined the rear tube and
spring plates. There is a fine silty rust in patches over most of the underneath
of the bus, but it doesn't look thick. I found a spot on the rear tube and began
sanding with some 200 grit paper. after a couple of minutes I was down to shiny
metal with some light pitting.  I rapped on it with my knuckles and it sounded
solid. The spring plates look better and don't seem to be that bad. The tube
will need to be thoroughly sanded and treated. It looks borderline, but on this
side of the border. I think my 66 bus rear tube and spring plate were worse and
I drove that for years like that. That's not to say it's clear sailing. the
cargo floor is beginning to rust, it will also need treatment. though I'm
probably a little biased, I think its salvageable, but will require some care
and attention.

I think I'm going to go ahead and order parts today. Namely  a muffler, starter,
clutch cable, TO bearing, clevis pin, coupler
and maybe some brake shoes. I'm hoping to save the heater boxes from this motor
at least for the time being. I'll know when I try to disassemble the motor
tonight. Just in case I'm going to order a set of those square exhaust port
gaskets, in case I have to use my only of pair of heater boxes which would
necessitate changing the heads on this case to the vanagon heads
I really hope I don't have to get into mix and match, but I also don't think I'm
prepared to throw down an extra 350 for a new set of 72-74 boxes.
