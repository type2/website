Re mysterious cutting out of all the electrics:
Doubt you have a short if you can wait an hour- your battery would be dead
and wires fried by then!  More likely a void in the ignition switch
contacts.  I'd be prepared to do a bypass in case it happens again:
     FI is trickier to bypass, but let's see.....You need ignition
current to the (+) terminal on the coil (jumper from there to either the
battery or terminal 88y or 88z on the double relay- always carry a 4ft
piece of insulated wire and a razor blade and tape- alligator clips on the
ends is nice also).   The starter should turn the engine merrily with a
wire run from the upper terminal 50 on the solenoid to the giant bolt
holding the 12v battery wire.   It can be done with a pair of pliers also.
That should take care of running the fuel pump, cold start valve, and aux.
air valve because terminal 50 also feeds the double relay term. 86a.  If
you don't want to lie under the bus and push start and it hasn't been run a
while, then I'd build up pressure in the fuel ring by running the pump
first (get juice to it- jump (+) current to 88d on double relay or get the
ignition to coil jumped on and open the air vane in the Air Flow Meter to
turn on the pump relay).
