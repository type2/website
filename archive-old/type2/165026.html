Subject: '79 work to be done

I picked up a 1979 Westy on Friday, had to tow it home. I did a 
compression check, 125, 0, 110, 110. Yep it looks like it has valve 
problems. It came with a 1.8 engine for spare parts.
The transmission linkage is screwed up (I hope). I can't find reverse 
and can usually find a fwd gear.

I plan to pull the engine and see about fixing or changing the heads 
(the 1.8 as parts), then mess with the linkage and then the brakes.
I have tools and know how to turn wrenches but it's been some years 
since I worked on an air cooled engine and I've never messed with 
transmission linkage.

If anyone can offer advice or a web site on checking/fixing the 
linkage I'd appreciate it. At this point I'm going to use Muir's book 
for changing the heads (I saw www.ratwell_dot_com 's write up on pulling 
the engine) and could use any other sources for the head change job.

Advice or web sites are appreciated.
