Subject: Re: [T2] Is there a power inverter FAQ?

Don said:

&gt;Also, some things are sensitive to the funky waveform

&gt;of an inverter. There
&gt;are inverters called &quot;modified sine wave&quot; converters 
&gt;that supposedly resolve
&gt;this issue, but that's open for debate.

Actually, the better ones (with a closer approximation
of a real sine wave) are called &quot;true sine wave&quot;
inverters.  The &quot;modified sine wave&quot; inverters are
usually only a liitle better than the old &quot;square
wave&quot; inverters and would be better termed &quot;modified
square wave&quot; inverters.  Exceltech makes very good
&quot;true sign wave&quot; inverters.

They are not cheap ones like you will find at discount
stores or truck stops.  Then again, you probably don't
need a good quality inverter in a bus. My
Trace/Xantrex inverter cost over $2000, but runs my
whole home using a battery that weighs over a ton, and
usually provides a better quality power than the
utility can furnish.

&gt;In your case, since the only thing you want to power 
&gt;is a laptop, you might
&gt;be better off buying a 12v power supply for it. 
&gt;They're available for all models of laptops, and if
you buy off &gt;that bay place it'll be reasonably
priced.

Very good point.  You are much better off running
everything possible directly on 12v DC and using an
inverter only for things that can't be run off of
12vDC and require 110v AC,and I can't think of
anything that I would need in a bus that falls in that
catagory, unless it is for the convenience of using a
small appliance from home.
