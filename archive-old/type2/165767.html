Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [WetWesties] Re: [T2] Can we weld new exhaust
  manifold flanges on our head...

And I agree that farmer's have their hands into a bunch, and do some
things that I've never seen or heard of---


Like chopping 3 ft. outa semi frame rails and butt welding them back
together, with a Forney buzz box.

I myself would back the splice up with a inside frame rail section.

Nupe---

I know plenty of them hauling real heavy right now ( 96, 94, 93 k pounds
) grossly overweight to the elevator,&amp; gettin' away with it. 
The frames of the trucks just creak a little.

But out of self preservation they taught themselves early on, and became
proficiant.

They didn't ask anybody prior to----they just did it.
