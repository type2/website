Subject: Need entire cooling air system..

...for 68-71 (going in 68 DC with generic 71 case)..1600 DP. Need all the
parts..including thermostat system. Got all kinds of spare shrouds with the
cheap DC...nary a one had cooling. One does have large oil cooler and
filter... I intend to use it..so think I'll drop the now running engine and
fix it up as a keeper...not ultimate engine, of course...but cheezz..at
least a cooling system, painted up tin, clean engine room, etc.

Cash..or, better yet, maybe I have something you need to trade :).  Thanks,

Marv Krupp...going backwards in the work on this truck.
