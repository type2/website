Subject: Re: newbie quesions-78 Westy

First, never forget to tell what year, and what model.

    Check all the joints in the steering.  Replace any with excessive play.
Don't forget to look under the front pan (if it's still there)

The accessory battery, if wired correctly, through the relay, should charge
when the engine is on, and be separate when the engine is off.

    That little silver receptacle is cool, huh?  Don't stick a screwdriver in
there.  I did that.  Then comes the replacing of fuses.  It's some kind of
outlet.  I forget for what.

    If you have a westy with a sink, the cigarette lighter is located on the
side panel, in front of the sink.  If you don't have a westy, there's
probably not a lighter.  Go to the store, buy the little kit, take the wires
off the silver thingy, and then you have one.

    Have fun!

&gt;
&gt; There seems to be a lot of play in the steering.
&gt;
&gt; Does the accessory battery charge while driving
&gt;
&gt; What is the small silver receptacle under the glove box?
&gt;
&gt; Is there a cigarette lighter receptacle?  Where?
