Subject: driving on snow/ice?

Greetings, all: 

I've been following the list enough to appreciate that some of the
topics return seasonally, like getting the heaters to work, wiring the
relay around the starter, etc.  I imagine this is another one. 

I'm fairly confident in my ability to drive on ice/snow.  I grew up on a
farm in Indiana, so I got to experiment in comparative safety from an
early age, and being a bus owner/driver has made me a gentler driver
anyway.  But there are two buts:  1. This is my first winter driving a
bus; and 2. I live in Portland OR [the latter is relevant because:  lots
of hills, virtually no snow removal equipment, and many *other* drivers
are really unpracticed at winter driving since snow and ice are
comparatively rare in PDX]. 

[I have plain radials on the bus, nothing fancy.  My 1970 bus has drum 
brakes. I live at the top of a long hill--I've got two inches of snow 
right now and downtown, 20 blocks and 500 feet in elevation below, has 
only rain.  Those are about the only special features of my situation.]  

I'm sure I'm not the only rookie who would benefit from the list's general
advice about driving a bus on snow/ice--technique, best tires, other
considerations?  [I couldn't get through on the net to the Hoover sermons
before I sent this note; is there one on this?  Other net resources? 

best
