Subject: Tune-ups and emissions

To All:

On air-cooled engines, the valves are the weakest link.  This is especially
true of Type-I's.  In several of my articles I've mentioned replacing the
heads -- in effect, doing a top-end overhaul -- at fifty or sixty thousand
miles, a period some consider ridiculously short.  Actually, even fifty thou
is pushing it... if you drive like I do.

If you're only interested in seeing how long your engine will run before
catastrophic failure, doing your valves every two or three years may seem a
waste of time and effort.  But if you're interested in keeping your engine in
top shape for as long as possible, you'll have to focus on the valves.

A point I may not have stressed sufficiently is that as your valve guides
wear, the hydrocarbon reading on your smog-check will go up.  The reason is
that worn guides cause oil to be sucked into the combustion chamber.  No
tune-up in the world is going to heal a worn valve guide.  Indeed, keeping
accurate records of your engine's emissions and plotting the steady rise of
HC, is one way of measuring valve guide wear.

Any effort to improve the performance of the Type I engine usually involves
increasing its horsepower by increasing its rpm and displacement.  This
usually calls for extensive modification to the heads including the use use
of larger valves, a different cam and so forth.  But for bus owners, who
typically need more torque rather than more horsepower, a more pragmatic
approach is to stick with the stock cam, increase displacement but take no
special pains with the heads other than to open them up for the larger
diameter cylinders.  The benefit here is that the stock valves will serve as
a rev limiter on the larger engine.  You'll have the torque you need at the
lower end but your top speed -- and engine rpms --  stay about the same.
 Using stock valves and unported heads keeps the price down,  makeing it
practical to keep a spare set of freshly overhauled heads on hand for easy
replacement.

As with any increase in displacement there will be an increase in waste heat
you'll have to deal with, but the modest 11% increase to 1776cc that comes
from using 90.5mm jugs is within the engine's cooling capacity, assuming it
is properly assembled and fitted with a dog-house oil cooler, although an
external oil cooler is good insurance if you live in a hot climate -- or
can't keep your foot out of it going up a grade.

The allowed emissions for early bugs and buses is so large that a properly
built 1776cc engine has no problem passing its bi-annual smog check.  Of
course, you must never mention the engine size or you'll be automatically
failed.
