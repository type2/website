Subject: Re: [T2] burned valve 2.0L/quandry

I can't tell from your post, but is that 2k to 4k for an engine
rebuild? If you have a burnt valve you can very likely just get a
rebuild head, put it on &amp; run with it. These are in the 2-3 hundred
range for good ones.

&gt; burned valve (i think) no compression in one cylinder
&gt;  i pulled the engine followed muirs instrucions of
&gt; tearing down to have the heads redone or replaced. now
&gt; i'm calling around San franisco bay area to get
&gt; rebuild prices and hearing prices like 2k to 4k.
&gt; can't do that in this bus   not worth it
