Hi,

I have not tried this option but I am intrigued. My friend had the bed of his 
pickup sprayed with this stuff called SprayBad or something like that. It is a 
dense rubbery material that you spray on your pickup bed instead of buying a 
bed liner. It is a apparently as durable as the bed liners you slide in with 
the added advantages that it prevents rust and reduces sound vibration. He 
says it is way quieter. It is also cheap. It costs around 200 USD to have it 
done. If we empty the inside of our busses and mask off from the windows 
upward this may be a good alternative. Better still, strip the inside bare get 
rid of any surface rust and spray all the corners with POR15 first.

A warning though, you would probably have to scrape some of it off in places 
where it causes interior parts not to fit where they once did.

Just a suggestion for anyone looking into soundproofing and willing to remove 
the interior.

Bob

PS: I am convinced this stuff would help a lot in the insulation department.
