Stephen,

When you say that you have installed 4-5 sets of the EMPI plug wires
in the last 18 months with no complaint, I hope you are saying that
you are a mechanic! 

I can't imagine changing plug wires 4-5 times in 18 months!!!!!!!!!!

Personally, I'll stick with the Bosch Lifetime Warranty.

Jaime
