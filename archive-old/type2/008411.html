I got a '72 VW Type II that is driving me crazy.

About a year ago, she suddenly would just decided to not turn the
starter.  It would not happen every time.  It was just on a rare
occasion.  Then it started becoming more frequent.

I cleaned all the connections for the positive and negative battery
cables and the problem went away for a spell.  Then, it crept back into
my life.  I have since changed the starter, ignition switch, battery
cables and battery.   Each with a grin from the local parts store!!!  I'm
beginning to despise his pimpled face!!!

This morning, I jumped in the beast and &quot;YOU GUESSED IT&quot;  the starter
would not engage.

I have lights, guages and all electrical components but the starter
soilonid will not kick in.  Not even a feeble click or clack!!!

Any suggestions would be appreciated.  

&lt; Feel free to write me direct to prevent overloading the list with
suggestions for my lame problem.&gt;
