Subject: safaris/ vw weekend

i like safari windows as it makes it really easy to steer while pushing the
bus backwards.

no, i haven't done anything more to the rat (65) westy, except buy 3 new
brake hoses.   I went to Vintage Meet sat and the bug nationals at S.I.R.
sun, and am burnt out. (no, not ANOTHER volkswagen!   ARGH!)   they had a
burn out contest at sir, which felt very appropriate.    The cat woke me up
at 4:30 sun morning with a dead mouse, and i couldn't get back to sleep,
  thanks kitty.

met some neat people, though, and borrowed an original copy of the 58 parts
list, the pictures are great!    there were some nice split window bugs
there, but no kubels or schwimmers.   the Crandalls brought their 55 barndoor
firewagen again, with the trailer that holds the 36hp water pumping motor.
  i didn't win the raffle for the vw dealer dienst sign :&lt;,    and Steve
Woods won the big wooden Mr. Bubblehead.  i want a tracing of that.          

i lent my friend and her boyfriend my bug Bugster to drive up, and while he
was trying to take a nap,  he was stopped by people taking pictures and being
amazed by it.  I have a full flow oil filter wired between the bumper and the
fender on the left, and a bumper sticker that says &quot;Honk if anything falls
off&quot;.  people like that  :&gt;
