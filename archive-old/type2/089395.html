Subject: Re: [T2] brake servo (booster) rebuild kit?


...It is very difficult to do this.  You have to bend apart the two halves
and
replace the diaphragm and seals...

That was the answer I was looking for.  I will give H&amp;R a call.

As a side thought.  Since the PO told me that my booster has a hole in it.
The brakes still function, a bit on the stiff side, but they still work.  Is
this pretty normal?
