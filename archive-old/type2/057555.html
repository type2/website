&gt; &gt; Yes, VW engineering can be improved upon, but not by stripping off the

&gt;
&gt; Well, useful, maybe, but not necessarily essential. My original
&gt; objection was to comments to the effect that removing the flaps, or even
&gt; the thermostat would lead to ruination of the engine, and that just
&gt; isn't true at all...

It won't ruin the engine immediately, but it will affect its life-span.

Nobody would drive a water-cooled car without a thermostat.  The car
would run too cold, resulting in excessive wear and poor running.  The
same thing applies to VWs too!

The thermostat isn't there only to warm the engine quicker.  It is also
there to throttle the cooling air to maintain engine temperature when
the ambient temperature is low.  If the air exiting the engine drops
below 70C, the flaps close a little.  If the air goes over 70C, they
open a bit.  This maintains the cylinders at a relatively constant
temperature.

I've tested this myself, by putting a pointer on one of the flap pivots.
On level highway driving, the flaps don't open fully until the ambient
temperature is around 60-70F.  At an ambient temperature of 30F, the
flaps are only about a quarter open on the same highway run.

This throttling effect also assists the heater.  If less air goes to the
cylinders, then more is available to go through the heat exchangers and
into the cabin.  When driving a flap-equipped VW, there is a noticable
increase in heated air volume when going from an uphill to a downhill.
The engine makes less heat, the flaps close, and more air goes to the
exchangers.

I learned my lesson on this right after I bought my flapless '71.  I
took a trip to northern NV during a cold snap.  The bus ran poorly,
belched smoke, and had a hard time idling.  The heater was anemic at
best.  I installed flaps and thermostat and now the bus runs as good in
cold conditions as it does when the weather is warm, and the heater
works better (though it could use some help!).

&lt;planned obsolescence stuff snipped&gt;

&gt; Now, you sell a car to Joe Lunchbox, the quintessential American
&gt; shade-tree mechanic -- and that's who was buying VW, lower class workers
&gt; and students and the like. They knew damn well how to take care of a
&gt; car, been doing it for years, right? Those old Fords and Chevys, heck,
&gt; why take it to the dealer for service? Change the oil every Fall and
&gt; Spring, or every 10,000 miles or so, put in new plugs every couple of
&gt; years -- no need for anything else, right?

Your memory of the American cars of the '40s is a bit different than my
father's. He changed oil, greased the chassis, and cleaned plugs and
points every 2000 miles.  All cars of that era required regular
maintainance.

&gt; So maybe those crafty German engineers figured -- hey, no oil
&gt; filter. Snicker. Hey, design this thing so the valves burn if you don't
&gt; adjust them often. Ever heard a vW called &quot;Hitler's Revenge&quot;? Every
&gt; think about how angry a lot of those people were back then about being
&gt; defeated? So lets design this thing so it works -- IF the owner takes it
&gt; to the dealer all the time.

This might be true if the VW was designed for the US market.  In fact,
the VW was designed to be maintained by its planned owner, a
middle-class German (yep, it was designed for the domestic German
market!).  It was designed to be maintained with as few tools and parts
as possible.  No filter meant that there was no need to stock spares.
The penalty for this was frequent oil changes, but at 2 liters per
change this was a good trade-off.  Not many cars of this era had
hydraulic lifters, so regular valve adjustment was a way of life.  When
hydraulic lifters became common, then the oil had to be cleaner, so
filters were added.

The conspiracy/revenge theory has about the same credibility as the
Black Helicopters!

 How about some design like that thermostat
&gt; cable that always breaks, and the flaps that are *supposed* to stay open
&gt; if it fails, but then, of course, if that little spring gets unhooked or
&gt; breaks, they flop back closed while you're cruising the highways.

Both of these occurances are usually the result of some shadetree
re-engineering.  I could be as simple as someone bending the spring the
wrong way when removing itl, which causes it to break later on.  I've
_never_ seen a stock setup fail in the closed position.

&gt; Well -- that's the kind of stuff I think about when people talk
&gt; about &quot;the VW engineers designed it right and ...&quot;  Every worked in a
&gt; car factory? I have.  I spent a year working in the American Motors plant
&gt; in Kenosha, WI as an apprentice electrician. I spent the nights up on a
&gt; ladder and crawling around above the assembly lines fixing lights. While
&gt; the line was in full operation -- quite an educational experience. Just
&gt; an incredible amount of sabatoge going on, pop bottles welded inside
&gt; frames, doors, etc. Valve grinding compound in engines and trannys. And
&gt; liquor bottle everywhere you looked.

Actually, I've worked at the GM Desert Proving Ground.  As a test
driver.  Didn't see any booze at all.  I really don't see what the
irresponsible acts of AM workers have to do with the engineering of VWs.

&gt; Now, American Motors is a far cry from a German autoplant.

I'm sure it is.  In Germany, they probably serve beer (_good_ beer) in
the cafeteria!

But I
&gt; just don't have any illusions about engineers or workers. It's obvious
&gt; that a lot of engineering in this world is done not just to save a penny
&gt; here and there, but to actually shorten the life of a unit -- otherwise
&gt; who would buy more? And workmanship -- well.

No, they're designed to a set level of durability.  The VW was
originally designed to go 100,000km.  Within this guideline, they made
the car as inexpensively as possible.  No conspiracy here, just ordinary
economic principles.  Everything is designed to a certain lifespan, from
children's toys to C-5A Galaxies.

The workmanship on VWs is amazing when you consider the price.  Vws use
a 1/4 inch thick weatherstrip in the doors for sealing while US cars use
1 inch thick seals to fill their greater tolerance.

I have yet to find any design feature in a VW that was incorporated to
reduce its durability.  There are things that could have been designed
to be longer lasting, but the added expense wasn't justified as long as
the part met its design life.

&gt; I started buying VW's not too long after working at AM, and one of
&gt; the reasons was that I felt the Germans (and Japanese as well) clearly
&gt; had a lot more pride and craftsmanship than Americans. And probably
&gt; that's still true, but I'll never accept the idea that &quot;the engineers
&gt; know better than you&quot;. There are a lot of reasons things get designed or
&gt; built the way they do, and not necessarily good ones.

Well, I'm a mechanical engineer by training.  I truly admire the
elegant, simple engineering inherant in aircooled VWs.  I have a lot of
respect for engineers who can design a part to be just strong enough to
do the job without being unreliable.  Anyone can design a 6000 pound
pickup that will carry a ton, but to design a 3000 pound vehicle that
can carry a ton of payload is an engineering feat!  The engineers
certainly knew what they were doing, and it would take a heck of a
shadetree mechanic to improve on their design.

&gt; But I really do like German stuff, just the same. VW's, Walthers,
&gt; and my current lust is for a '60 BMW bike.

I like my R100RT as well, for the same reasons I like my VWs!
