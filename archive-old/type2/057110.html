Subject: PH8A balloon and sliding door uide roller

Hi folks,

Here are a couple FYIs for listmembers in similar situations.

On a recent road trip, the lower guide roller  on the sliding door finally
died.  The roller itself was a bit pitted and had some flat spots which
contributed to stressing the bearings/cage until they finally broke.  It's
one of those parts that, when it breaks, you have to say &quot;Guide roller,
you've served this bus faithfully for 27 years and fell in the line of
duty, rest in peace old friend!&quot;  The used rollers I've come across at
swap meets had working, though loose, bearings, but they all showed signs
of pitting as well.  So I decided to buy a new one from VW.  They aren't
cheap (they list for the princely sum of $39.15, my local dealer cuts our
VW club a discount so I paid $33.28).  Expensive, but if you don't have a
lathe to make one and you don't want to hunt around for the right bearing,
it's worth the price.  For anyone else interested in getting one, they are
made in Germany and have a nice shiny plating on the roller.  The ID is
larger, so your stock rubber plug (to keep the grease in) won't work on
the new roller.  I didn't check on the availability of a replacement plug,
just made one out of scrap rubber.  Before you go to VW for this part
(211-843-419) check with our list vendors for a better price.

This past weekend during a routine oil change on my '71 with full flow, I
noticed that my PH8A had ballooned and was actually loose enough at the
crimped seam for the canister to spin freely.  I previously used the HP1
because I had heard horror stories of ballooning/exploding oil filters,
but I thought I would be spared this fate since I am using the Berg
pressure relief pump cover.  Apparently, the pressure generated by the oil
pump is enough to affect the filter before the pressure relief valve has a
chance to kick in.  This filter failed (didn't explode, but looks like the
scheduled oil change came just in time to prevent that) within the past
3500 miles in starting/running temp range between 50-95 deg F, using both
10w40 and 20w50 oil.  What could easily have contributed to the problem is
the second oil cooler I installed after the filter (stock doghouse style)
that likely provides too much restriction on cold summer (50-55 deg F)
startups without an aftermarket oil thermostat installed (it's going in
tomorrow).  I won't use my engine as a guinea pig to determine if adding
the oil thermostat eliminates this problem--I'm returning to using the
Fram HP1 at the same time.

I'm mentioning this FYI, to anyone else thinking they might get away with
the PH8A during summer months.  I might have a unique situation because of
my auxilliary oil cooler setup, but maybe not.
