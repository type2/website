Subject: Re: [T2] Egg on my bus

Man,  change neighborhood !!, there is nothing worth than republican 
kids riding their scooters.  ;-)
Give my best to your bus !

I don't want to start a polemic but I am wondering how many VW bus got 
anti-Democrat  stickers  on  it !!  ;-)

By the way I've been told by a friend about a very nice sticker on a 
westy I'd like to find. This sticker was about some guys in a Westy with 
a long line of  angry honking drivers waiting to pass the way too slow 
Westy ! At some point , one of the passenger asked : &quot; can we go any 
faster ? &quot; the driver replied  &quot; Yes , but  what  are we going to do 
with the Westy !!!??&quot;

Chris

vanagon 83 , no sticker yet  !!!

&gt;My bus was egged last night or the night before.  I'm angry about it and don't have anyone else to tell right now.  Is it because I live in a very republican neighborhood and have anti-bush stickers on my van?  Perhaps it's because it doesn't move every day like it used to, although it is parked right in front of my house.  Maybe it's because the neighborhood kids have nothing to do but ride their scooters and bikes up and down the street all night long.
