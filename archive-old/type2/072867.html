well, after i so-suavely replaced my steering box, coupler and horn wire
(read all about it in the tech pages on t2_dot_com!), i drove
the dang thing one block and it began to beep on it's own!  we were going
up a slight incline; turn signals were on, beeped in rhythm sorta w/ the
flashers.
did it again later - slight incline, a turn, but no flashers.. just randumb
beeps.

my personal hunch is that the steering lock / ignition assembly is buggered
electrically  and that JUST after i got the thing back on the road, off all
that dastardly ignition crap has to go. and on a 70, that AIN'T fun.

so.  any less UNPLEASANT fixes i can eliminate first?
