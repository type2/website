Subject: Re: [T2] Which is right or left?

&gt;&gt;I love these questions, spatial definition is really the essence of what 
&gt;&gt;it means to be human.

Now I will give my attempt at spatial definition, to establish my essence as 
human.


&gt;&gt;There are many reasons I feel this way but, defining the space we occupy 
&gt;&gt;is an on going process.

... on going process??? Thanks, then I guess I'm not too late..

&gt;&gt;Right and left are human spatial attributes that we use to associate with 
&gt;&gt;the things we interact with

OK, if the passenger sits on the right side, is the driver sitting on the 
wrong side??  Maybe the blokes (RHD) have something there.

If I put two candy bars on the table, and I take on off, then the candy bar 
that is still on the table is left.  So the candy bar I took off is the 
right one.  By definition, I can never select select the wrong candy bar.

Saying 'Front Is Front' is as silly as saying 'right is right', or is it 
'might is right'??

&gt;&gt;What do you have control over, and if there isn't anyone else in your bus 
&gt;&gt;with you, is there a right side anyway?

D_at_^n, this is getting too metaphysical for me.  I'm right, and you're wrong, 
so if I'm the driver, my side is the right side.  Of course....
