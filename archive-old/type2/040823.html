&gt; Greetings,
&gt; 
&gt; Last year I replaced my AFM with a rebuilt unit from Bus Depot.  I've
&gt; noticed that my Bosch Platinum plugs foul very quickly.  I've read the
&gt; threads in the Archive about these plugs fouling, but was wondering if I
&gt; might be running rich.

The Platinum plugs might not be the best choice for a bus with points
ignition.  The smaller tip encourages spark discharge, but discharge
occurs before voltage builds to an optimum level.  This is fine with
&quot;modern&quot; CD ignitions, but our Kettering ignitions don't have as much
energy to deliver.

Anyway, that's my theory.  I found that my bus ran better on standard 
plugs.
