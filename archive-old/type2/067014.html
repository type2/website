Steve,

You wrote:

Having said that, does anyone know about any kind of hitch that will
mount to my bus without replacing the stock '72 bumper?

I write:

I have one on my 74 and it seem to bolt the the engine support bar that  
is just in front of the bumper.  The tow bar tongue extends under the  
bumber and does not require any mods.

Unfortunately for you I would like to keep it, hope this helps you though.

Contact me directly if you have any other questions.

Good luck.

David &quot;da 74 bus man&quot;
