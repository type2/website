George,

Ummmm....2 feet???  Ya looked at many U.S. cars lately?

My wife's old Saturn 4 cyl had an o2 sensor about 6&quot; from all the exhaust 
ports.

The folks on the megasquirt list at one time recomended to get it as close 
to the exhaust port as was comfortable.

I'll admit that on a VW it might be harder to do, but the idea is that you 
want a non-heated O2 sensor to get warmed up as rapidly as possible to get 
correct readings.  A heated sensor can go further from the exhaust port if 
necessary.

Yes, on a stock VW T1, if you get it very close to the exhaust port, 
you've done something interesting although thinking over the ones I have 
seen, I think it might be done without trying to get it in the actual 
muffler itself.  Sure, you are going to only be measuring one cylinder
but with one carb feeding them all, well, you have a good chance at 
getting close to the proper AFR.


Might be able to cut and weld a bung on either the #2 or #4 muffler 
tubes...or there might be enough room to put one in on one ofthe heater
boxes where they mate with the muffler...especially if you use the 
&quot;modern&quot; flange bolt up method instead of the push to fit/clamp method.




But 2 feet????...

Cheers, dave

 Well, it can't be closer than two feet to the exhaust port and also can't
 be close to the tip of the exhaust.  I'd say that the best place for the
 sensor is right in the middle of the muffler, but it might be a bear to
 weld a proper bung to the thin sheet metal.
