&gt; Hello all!
&gt;
&gt; As you may already know, the restoration on my '70
&gt; Westy is nearing completion and I have a few odds and
&gt; ends to attend to.
&gt;
&gt; One such thing is the engine tin.  I just got it all
&gt; out of the box so I could prep it for paint and I
&gt; noticed that some of it isn't in the best of shape.
&gt; My main concern is what I believe to be the rear cover
&gt; plate; though I'm not too sure about that.  It doesn't
&gt; look like any of the cover plates I see in my
&gt; cataloges at all (doesn't have round holes cut cut for
&gt; the fresh air ducts, though it does have a rather
&gt; ratty, rectangular hole cut out on one side).  I know
&gt; there were holes for the fresh air ducts, though there
&gt; doesn't seen to be any provisions for such on one side
&gt; and the only hole on the other is the rather ratty
&gt; looking one mentioned earlier.
 this is the front engine cover plate that fits over the front of the engine
( i call it the fire wall tin) it should have two or three little clips,
that clip, over the engine case just above the flywheel.  the vent tin that
attaches to the back of the oil cooler goes through that rectangular hole.
it should also have raised  edges on the shoulders of it for a tight fit
against the engine seal.  If yours dosen't have the raised edges, you have
the one that is for a bug engine.
&gt; Is this indeed the rear cover plate? (rear means back
&gt; of the bus closest to the engine door).  Is there some
&gt; other piece that is shaped similar to the rear cover
&gt; plate on a bus?
no, and yes, -- the rear cover plate is the one that has the round holes for
the fresh air hoses,  and the cut outs for the heat risers with two thredded
holes on each side of the heat riser heat shields to screw into. You do have
the two little heat riser heat shields?don't you?

&gt; I plan on replacing this one part becase it's in the
&gt; worst shape.  The cataloges sell them with the fresh
&gt; air duct cutouts, but without cutouts for the pre-heat
&gt; tubes.  Do I need to get one with the pre-heat cutouts
&gt; as well, and if so, is there anyplace that has one?
&gt; This is on a '70 Westy with a dual port engine.
there are many suppliers you can get them from.  After you get it sorted
out, let me know what you have and exactly what you need I may have it for
you.
