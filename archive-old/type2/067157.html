Subject: '66 trip, mountains and blizzards

I'd been planning to do this trip earlier in the season, mebbe late September
or early October but work stuff kept getting in the way, meetings, etc.
Finally this last weekend I had the chance so I took vacation Friday and
Monday and headed out Friday morning.

The weather forecast said &quot;rain and cold&quot; for Tucson.  My plan was to drive
my '66 bus to my brother's house in Grants, New Mexico.  A few years ago I'd
been at my brother's house when Tucson had &quot;rain and cold&quot; and the low
temperature one night in Grants was -33F.  I didn't like the forecast.

Until I left the weather had been beautiful for a couple weeks, the heat
had gone away, we had sunny days, highs in the 70s-80s.  I'd spent the
last couple weekends preparing the vehicle.  This would be my first long
trip in this bus (about 750 miles, round trip) and I wanted it to be as
ship-shape as possible.  Fortunately, one of the things I did was to hook
up the heat (I needed to replace the heater cables).  I believe that the
heat in this bus works as well as possible because the heat-exchangers
are in excellent shape and all the ducting is complete.  Unfortunately,
I have yet to replace many of the rubber seals around the doors and windows
so I still have air leaks and the bus is mostly uninsulated (something
I plan to change in the near future).

My main concern about the bus for an extended trip was the windshield
(windscreen) wipers.  Although I have converted my bus to 12-volt, the
wipers still have the original 6-volt motor.  With this setup I seem to
have three settings for my wiper switch (stock, 2-speed wipers):

    fuse-blow   (fully counter-clockwise)
    almost-off  (middle position)
    high-speed  (fully clockwise)

I call it the &quot;almost-off&quot; position because the wipers almost go off when
the switch is in this position, but not quite, I have to move the switch
so that it is between any two positions to get the wipers to stop, then I
can switch to &quot;almost-off&quot; and they will stay off.  The &quot;fuse-blow&quot; position
moves the wipers across the glass about as fast as the &quot;almost-off&quot; position
but seems to have a very hard time moving the wipers when they are near the
&quot;park&quot; position at the right end of their travel.  The wipers move slowly and
I can tell this draws a lot of current because the headlights dim and it
often blows the wiper/turn-signal fuse.  So, I only use the &quot;almost-off&quot;
and &quot;high-speed&quot; settings because they never blow the fuse and seem to work
normally.  That said, I also never use the &quot;high-speed&quot; setting except to
get the wipers started so that I can immediately switch to &quot;almost-off&quot;.
If I leave the wipers on &quot;high-speed&quot; the motor spins with a high pitched
whine and the wipers beat back and forth with such vigor that I imagine
various parts of the wiper system would soon come flying out from under
the dash if left in that state for any length of time.

So, Friday morning I wake to clouds and Janice says the forecast is for
&quot;rain and cold&quot; (oh, and &quot;wind&quot;) and do I really think it's a good idea
to go?  I say sure, what the heck, a good test of the trip worthiness
of the old bus.

This was also a good time to learn about the hill-climbing ability of
an early bus with a semi-stock 1600 dual-port engine (Solex 34 PICT-3 carb,
stock exhaust, dog-house oil cooler).  The route I take to Grants has
a lot of hills, the section between Globe, AZ and Show Low, AZ has
14,000 feet of climbing, round trip, although no single hill is more than
about 2,000 feet of continuous uphill.

The bus was running well and I cruised at between 55 and 60 mph up through
Catalina and over the hill through Oracle and down to Mammoth, then flat
to Winkleman.  The clouds seemed to be thickening and there was a bit of
wind but nothing serious.  The first and one of the steepest hills I hit
on the way up was between Winkleman and Globe, the signs say its a 7-8%
grade and there are various &quot;runaway truck escape ramps&quot; along that part
of state route 77 (these escape ramps *always* inspire my confidence in
the safety of the route :-)  I ended up in 2nd gear for about 2 miles
with much of the rest of the hill done in third.  I tried various speeds
in 2nd and 3rd and decided I like to go about 25 in 2nd and 40 in 3rd
but do, on occasion, drive almost 30 in 2nd and 45 in 3rd.  The engine
certainly ran well but it is obvious that the power/weight is considerably
less for this bus than for my '87 jetta.

I didn't stop when I got to Globe (100 miles), for gas, because I had my
gas can in the back with 5 extra gallons (I have a stock 10.5 gallon tank)
so I headed on up 60 toward the Salt River canyon.  The gorge of the salt
river is about 1500 feet deep where route 60 crosses it and is a very
scenic spot, not quite the Grand Canyon but then you can't drive your bus
through the Grand Canyon either.  60 goes right to the bottom, across a
bridge and up the others side making many turns and twists along the way.
Turns out, I had a tail wind climbing out of the gorge and this helped
considerably.  I stopped at the rest stop at the bottom to dump my
extra gas in and then breezed up the other side in 3rd, no problem.

It was about this time that I saw one of the only two other air-cooled busses
I saw on this trip and we both waved with feelin'.

On up to Show-Low, up and down hills, light traffic, climbing lanes helped,
nothing much different than the 40 or so other times I've made this trip.
The weather outside was probably in the 40s and 50s, I was comfortable in
the bus with sweats, adjusting the heater and vents along the way.  I haven't
put a working radio in this bus yet but I had Janice's &quot;boom-box&quot; seat-belted
into the passenger seat and was listening to some native-american flute music.
Had to have the volume most of the way to full to hear it clearly over the
engine noise/wind noise/front tire noise and various rattles.

At Show-Low (188 miles) I filled up my tank and gas can at Shell (getting
about 20 mpg) and pulled into McDonald's for a chicken sandwich.  I had 
planned to sit inside and relax for lunch but the weather was taking a
turn for the worse.  The wind had picked up, the radio said it was gusting
to 45 mph and dark clouds were approaching from the south-west.  Sleet
was falling and the temperature had dropped into the 30s so I used the
drive-through and headed for Springerville.  (I noted that the employees
at the at the Shell station were watching the weather and grinning from
ear to ear, the winter tourist season was beginning!)

The drive to Springerville was an experience with wind.  This is normally a
windy area and there are signs that say &quot;severe cross winds, next seven miles&quot;
about every seven miles or so, but today was exceptional.  I generally look
at the trees and grass at the edge of the road to see how far they are bent
as a rough wind guage and today the grass was stretched out straight at about
a 45 degree angle whipping around in the gusts.  Most of the time the wind
was coming from my right although at times it was also a bit in front of me.
One long hill was almost straight into the wind, it wasn't very steep but
I ended up in 2nd gear nevertheless.  (later that night when I was going
to sleep there was a bit of a dull ache in my upper arms and I believe
it came from holding a steady course through this wind.)  My steering is
good because I've recently replaced the drag link and all the tie-rod ends
and I have very little steering play, but I was still buffeted quite a bit
and had to concentrate on position with respect to the road.  Somewhere
past Vernon the road tops out at 7750 feet and then rolls on down into
Springerville.

At Springerville (~230 miles) I had apparently outrun the storm and the sleet
had stopped but the black clouds were looming in my rearview mirror.
Surprisingly, I was still comfortably warm in the bus, the heater was pumping
out a constant stream of warm air, specially on some of the long hill climbs.
(at various points on this trip, when I stopped, I always checked the engine
temperature by feeling the oil dipstick and it was always warm, never at all
hot.)

I stayed on 60 as far as Quemado (300 miles) only stopping at the rest area
near Red Hill for a few minutes along the way.  When I walked into the general
store in Quemado for a cup of coffee, the storm was right on my heels so I
didn't stop long. (There is a fairly rust-free splitty bus (64-67) at a guy's
house there in Quemado.  I've been keeping my eye on it whenever I pass through
for the past 3 years or so.  The one time I talked to him about 2 years
ago he said he was getting it ready for a trip to Texas and had it running.
I guess they never went to Texas because the bus is still there, sitting in
the yard, getting older.)

The route from Quemado to Grants follows 36 north to a junction with 117
and then on up for a short jaunt on old route 66 into Grants, about 70
miles.  Looking north I could see that the storm had progressed further
east in that direction and the road ran right towards blackness.  Since
I wanted to get to my brother's house before dark and there wasn't much
choice of routes, I headed into it.

The wind was still blowing but now it was coming from my left and was 
carrying some rain with it.  I had Rain-Xed my windshield, rearview
mirrors, door windows and rear window in hopes of avoiding the use of
my questionable wiper setup but I hadn't bargained on snow.  About the
time I turned onto 117 the rain was turning to snow.  I stopped here to
dump my 5 gallon can of gas into the tank, it was cold!  At first the snow
was a wet and sloppy but it got progressively more snow-like as I went
and started falling faster.  It was dark, the Rain-X seemed to help a
little with rain, causing it to form tight little blobs of water on the
glass rather than smearing out as it usually would but the soggy snow just
splatted and stayed there.  I turned my wiper on, to &quot;almost-off&quot;, and forged
ahead.

The road is bumpy along this route and now there was quite a lot of
water in puddles in the road.  I'd slowed down to about 50 mph but
it was still a rough ride, I slowed to 45 mph.  It was snowing sideways
about 30 miles south of Grants and I-40.  I began collecting snow/ice
on the front surface of the bus and the windshield became completely
packed with snow except for the areas swept by the wipers.  I was concerned
that the headlights might be covered but since the traffic was nil I
didn't stop to check.  I worried that the wipers would fail completely
from overheating and periodically reached under the dash and put my hand
on the motor, it was warm but never got hot.  And the wipers kept working,
at 12 volts, loaded up with snow, for about an hour until I got to there.
(370 miles)

Next day I pried an ice sheet about 1/2 inch thick off the front of the
bus, took a picture first tho, mebbe I'll post it when I can.

Generally, I'm happy with the performance of the bus on this trip.
Traveling this way is slower than in most other vehicles.  Although I
was able to travel at the speed limit (55) on many roads I still found
myself one of the slowest vehicles and going up hills I felt like a
semi-truck.  I figure, on the highway, my current heater setup is good
down to about 35F and I think when I get the bus sealed up better and
insulated, I might be able to push that down by 10 degrees or so.  But
still, those early morning drives from the motel to the ski lifts
(on ski trips) are gonna be cold ones unless I get a propane heater or
some such.  Fortunately, in Tucson, the weather is rarely cold.

I also noticed that in Grants, at 6500 feet my idle was slow and I had to
open the bypass screw on the carb thus increasing the idle.  When I got back
to Tucson, the idle was too fast.  Anyone know why this happens?  Seems to
be an altitude thing.

This engine was worked hard on this trip an performed flawlessly.  My
gratitude goes to Mark Stephen's shop where the long block was built
and to Bob Hoover for much useful advice (in the sermons an by e-mail)
while I was building it up.

After much visiting with my brother and his family, playing Mario Brothers 64 
for many hours with my two nieces (an amazing little video game), and helping
stage a church Halloween party Saturday, I headed home Monday morning.  The
trip back to Tucson was in similarly bad weather but was mostly a driving rain
rather than snow.  I found the rain easier to handle than snow and the weather
south of the Salt River canyon was positively pleasant.

Oh my, 209 lines already, better end it now....
