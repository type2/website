Subject: Re: How Hot is too Hot for Oil Temperature 

I'll chime in on this one.

There is so much variability among VDO gauges/senders (not to mention 
VW engines), that there is really no steadfast number to go by.

Driving a VW is a seatofthepants proposition anyway, but it sure helps 
to know the numbers that the gauges give you.

Oil temperature seems to fluctuate according to RPM (it seems that it 
more readily increases, but it takes a while for it to decrease).  If 
you're going 4,000 RPM and the temp is 250, then you're probably 
pushing it.  Slow down, but don't expect the oil temp to drop for 
another 10 or 15 minutes.

Cylinder head temp (CHT) seems to fluctuate according to load on the 
engine (and fluctuates more readily than oil temp).  If you're pulling 
a long grade and it gets above 400-450, then it may be a good time to 
pull over and give it a rest,  I've tried resting at idle and with the 
engine off, and it seems to do better with the engine off (both oil 
temp and CHT).  Take your time.

I have noticed that after a while of highway driving, when I pull up to 
a stop light, the CHT will go up very quickly, but when I get the fan 
RPMs back up, the CHT will go down.

Those explosions going on in your cylinders generate a lot of heat, and 
there is a point where the fan's/oil's ability to take that heat away 
from the cylinders is not sufficient.  After driving around for a good 
little while under different conditions (and weather), you will get a 
feel for that &quot;sweet spot.&quot;

Don't forget, however, the seatofthepants aspect of driving.  Believe 
it or not, your bus tells you a lot about how its doing by the way it 
feels through your butt, feet, and hands.
