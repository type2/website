It is commonly done for removal.  Don't worry about low setting, just
crank it up, make _sure_ it is set to loosen, and have at it.

Do not use the impact gun to reinstall the nut!

I don't have fancy air tools, so I use a 1-7/16&quot; - 3/4&quot; drive socket, a
slide bar, and a 3 foot piece of pipe for a cheater.  To hold the flywheel
in place I use a 4 foot piece of 1-1/4&quot; angle iron drilled for two of the
pressure plate bolts.  This works well and I don't have to apply excessive
force to anything.
