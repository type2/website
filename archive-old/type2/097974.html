Subject: Re: [T2] 914 engine vs. bus f.i.  f.i. question

Hello List,

Well, I seemed to have answered my own question. I
went outside to put all my tools away and get ready
for bed when I stumbled across this old, tattered
intake manifold gasket. Oddly enough it was made to
fit both a bus and a 914. I simply placed it on one of
the runners and used a magic marker to mark the holes.
Now all I have to do is drill them and I can use the
runners! This time, it wasn't my blonde hair that
caused me to answer my own question, it was just good
luck. Thanks anyway. If any one else has the same
problem, just email me and I will mail you the gasket
to use as a templet for drilling new intake manifold
stud holes on your runners.

I hope I haven't wasted too many people's time with
these posts. Have a great night!

&gt; The outer holes do not match up either. I could
&gt; fudge
&gt; it and drill 3 new holes in each runner, but knowing
&gt; me, that would take all day and they would never
&gt; line
&gt; up correctly much less seal down on the heads....
