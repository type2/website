Sami,

Thanks for the pointer to the wiring diagrams...and THANKS for hosting
them. Those will help a lot. 

I'm also looking for the BA6 manual with tune-up instructinos and such, if
anyone has one.

I had one years ago, but gave it over to someone who could  use it more
than I (who at the time did not have a BA6). If I could remember who I gave
it to, I'd write and ask for a copy. ;) Joe
