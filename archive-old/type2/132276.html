Subject: Factory engine tools

I recently picked up a couple of factory engine tools from a VW dealer that
are depicted in Bentley.

The first is the spacer used to remove the fan hub from the Type 4 crank.
You could probably eyeball it but here are some measurements anyway for
those who need to fabricate their own spacer.

The next two tools are the oil seal arbors for the crank. They are somewhat
harder to duplicate but I'm entertaining the idea of making some out of
billet aluminum on a friend's milling machine. They are expensive tools
considering the Euro and the cost to ship them from germany (they are very
heavy) given the usage they get.

Here's how they work:

Here are the Bentley photos showing them in use:

I really did not enjoy putting in the last flywheel seal with a dead blow
hammer.

Alex, where are you photos of your homemade flywheel seal installer?
