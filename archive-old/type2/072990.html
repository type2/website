Subject: And so it begins....

Saturday evening, I took delivery of Chuck's bus -- actually, Blake's bus.
I promised Blake (who is 4) that I would take very good care of his bus,
and he gave me permission to take it and made me &quot;pinky swear&quot; not to sell
it. He also approved the name: &quot;Gooma-gabba.&quot;

So now I have a second bus -- a 69 bench-seat sunroof pop-top Euro Westy
(sans camping gear). I already have a gas heater lined up to replace the
one that was there as original equipment. (Thanks, Steve!) :-) It was
originally maroon (and still is on the inside), but it has been painted
dark blue with crudely but charmingly drawn green images of the continents
on both sides. Hawaii is huge, towards the back on the passenger side. It
also has green handprints on the cargo hatch (&quot;push here&quot;).

I was about half surprised when I went out to the alley this afternoon to
clean it up, and it was GONE! &lt;big sigh&gt; Call the LAPD, get the number of
the towing company, make arrangements to pick it up, bail it out, go to the
other tow yard which was right across the street from a &quot;Truck and Van
Salvage&quot; yard (oh, the horror!). When they towed it out to the street so
AAA could tow it home for me, I found the slider vent wing had been punched
in so that whoever thought my locked van was &quot;junk&quot; and a &quot;public hazard&quot;
could unlock it to tow it away (the cop thinks). Duh.

Get it home. File a report about the breakage with LAPD. Start cleaning it up.

I have a coterie of neighborhood girls, about 8 to 12 years of age, who
think it's very cool that I have a bunch of cats and work on cars. They
swarmed over this afternoon and declared the bus wonderful and helped me
wash and wax it. They tried to sneak into the frame on the evidenciary
photos the cop was taking of the knocked out window. They get to help fix
it up. They're quite amusing! Kids and buses....

Hopefully, it'll still be out there Monday morning when I go to the DMV
first thing. The neighborhood girls are going to yell in my window at 7:30
a.m. on their way to school. (I'm *so* NOT a morning person.)

I'm going to appeal the tow and try to get a refund. They didn't put a
sticker on it, they didn't put a ticket on it -- they just towed it! I
think I've got a pretty good case, as I got it Saturday night and DMV's not
open until Monday morning, and it's not like I was being irresponsible. The
cops were pretty cool about it. It was the Department of Transportation who
called it a &quot;public hazard&quot; and said there'd been &quot;complaints&quot; -- after
only 12 hours? most of them at night? -- that had it towed at 8:43 this
morning.

Some of my neighbors here in San Pedro are more of a public hazard. At
least I have a hobby. One of our friendly neighborhood tweakers came out
and wanted to know what I was on, after I'd been out there about five hours
straight cleaning. Ever heard of enthusiasm?
