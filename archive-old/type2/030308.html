&gt; Hello All,
&gt; Really hate sounding ignorant here, but ya'll have me cornfused!!  185
&gt; or 195, r14 or strait 14??
&gt; I understand the load rating d is better.
&gt; So my question?  71 westy, load d, but what size.  I believe I am
&gt; running 195R14 now.

185R14 Load Range D best
185R14 Load Range C fine
195R14 OK as long as the load rating is above 1540 pounds.
195/75R14 Load Range D will work in a pinch but the OD is a bit small.
     Your engine will run about 4% faster at a given speed.
195/75R14 Load Range C isn't strong enough.

HTH, George Lyle
