&gt;Now they all seem to have one notch, but depending on year it
&gt;can be at 7.5 before, 0 or 5 ATDC.  

Not to worry.  Just remove #1 spark plug and use the old
pencil-in-the-hole trick to find 0 TDC and paint a mark on the pulley.
Then if you need it, use a $1.29 school-supply protractor to get a mark
at 5 or 7.5 or 27 or whatever you like.
