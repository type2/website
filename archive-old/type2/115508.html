Subject: Re: [T2] cold start injector

Doubtful that it is the cold start injector.  It pulses for a brief period
of time, depending on the ambient temperature at its sensor that is located
under the air distributor.  Believe it or not, unless the motor is hot from
running, it pulses a second or two in the summer.  In the winter a little
longer.  I have watched it with my own eyes, as well as seen the data chart
in my VW FI book.........


I have had motors with bad ecu's.........the cold start would give the motor
gas, then it would just die.  Not what you describe at all.


I would suspect a vacuum leak or timing.............those would give the
symptoms you describe.  Start with a valve adjustment........you may see
that you are losing a valve seat.
