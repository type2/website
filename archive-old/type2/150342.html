Yesterday I took out my battery and replaced the battery tray (tricky job).
Today I put the battery back in, hook everything back up, and no start.

My lights come on as they should. I turn the key and it sounds like it
starts but then it dies. If I get it to turn over and then hit the
accelerator, it stalls.

It has to be related to something yesterday, since it had been starting on
the 1st try before that.

Thoughts?
Thanks,
Eric
