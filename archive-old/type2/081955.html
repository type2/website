Subject: [T2] NPT

&gt;Having worked as a fire sprinkler designer, I always saw it written as &quot;nominal pipe thread&quot;,
&gt;meaning pipe that had a I.D. of 1.038&quot; say, was called 1 1/4&quot; NPT?

&gt;1/8&quot; NPT (National Pipe Taper) thread.

&gt;NPT = National Pipe Thread

Maybe should be Normal Plumber's Measurement, insofar as it
appears they don't use rulers. And 1.038 &quot; is not 1 1/4 &quot;.
(But maybe close enough for plumbing work :)
Even more curious why there is no DIN for the oil sender hole.
So, OK, then- just how close is the interchange between  senders
that are 10X1.0 straight thread and those that are 1/8 i.p.NPT tapered ?
