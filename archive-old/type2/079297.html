Subject: Re: [T2] Paint question

The problem sounds lke the primer is shrinking below the top
coat---causing the paint to look like spider webs, crows feet,
whatever----
And--here's another burr in the saddle---
Rust-O-leum, is not compatible with allot of other paints----it's the
fish oil in it that causes the problem.

Awful lot of work, to straighten this out---

You stuck now with that fish oil paint---

Let it set up and run over it with 600, then try again-----

Later,


Terry

Hi all, 
So I'm having some painting frustrations. Never done body work before so
be gentle with me. The top coat is acting funny. It's sorta making
spider web-like patterns in some areas. These webs are slightly raised
above the rest of the paint, almost as if the paint is wrinkling; a
funny looking bubble. A friend told me it's due to oils from my (or
anyone's) hands under the primer. But that doesn't seem correct. 
Some background on what I did. Sanded the rusty spots down to bare
metal. Not all spots were rusty so I didn't go down to bare metal. Some
spots got POR-15 but most did not. Primed, 2-3 light coats. Sanded with
400 grit. Top coated. First top coat &quot;spider-webbed&quot; or wrinkled or
whatever. 
The real odd thing is this has only happened on the top half of the bus.
The white half. This isn't happening on the bottom half. The only
difference is I'm using a white top color on top and a yellow on bottom.
Yes, I'm using cheap rattle can Rust-o-leum (no flames, please) but that
wouldn't explain why it's only happening in some places. 
So I'm a bit frustrated. Makes me want to grab a paint brush and just
start slapping it on. All helpful comments appreciated. 
Thanks,
-PM
