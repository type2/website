Subject: Wiring for relay of second battery for 79 Westy 

Hi:

The other day I had to remove the spare battery of my 79 Westy (Fed version )
and I accidentally disconnected all the wires that go to 
the relay on the inside of the engine compartment (close to the upper
left hand corner of the engine door) 

Anybody would know how to reconnect the wires or can the contacts be
interchanged ?

Thanks.

Frank
