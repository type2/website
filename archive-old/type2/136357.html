Subject: Re: [T2] upper bunk for a 73 westy?

NO WAY NO HOW did that come out of a FACTORY 73 Westy.

73 was one-year-only gold cloth. The 73 upper cot was
one-year-only also, mounted on the passenger side and
is longer. The 73 was the 1st year the Westy was NOT
built on a sun-roof bus body. 73 was the last year of
the front hinge pop top.

74 was the 1st year of the plaids. 1st year of the
rear hinge pop top. 1st year of the upper BED.

That outfit does not have a clue about what they are
smoking!

 I have though about switching my upper bunk from a
 cot to a padded bed several
 times over the years, but never tried it. I know
 that one of the list members
 has done this, so I know it can be done. As I was
 surfing the samba last month
 I ran across this ad.

 I emailed the
 seller and they said that it was indeed for a 73. I
 thought I was pretty sure
 that the 73 never came out with a foam bed for the
 upper bunk, but maybe I am
 wrong. Can anyone verify if this is an option on a
 73 or if this setup would
 work in my 73? They also said that they have all the
 brackets needed to mount
 it.
