Subject: Hi-Output Ignition Coil

Ok, so lemme get this straight. If my Bosch distributor is NOT a points
distributor (I don't think it is), then I can use my Accel High Energy
ignition coil in place of the standard one? I realize it won't exactly give
me any increase in power, but it might help my motor run just that much more
efficiently. Plus, I have one that's almost brand new from a car that I used
to own that I ended up switching to a different system. So I've got it
sitting around, and right now the Bus is the only car I have (other than the
Volvo) that uses the standard 12volt ignition coil like this one does.

It won't cause my Bus to run hotter will it?

Thanks,
