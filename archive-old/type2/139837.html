&gt; &gt; port == four letters, left == four letters.  Therefore, port == left.

&gt; &gt; .. but this doesn't really relate to Busses unless you haul a canoe or
&gt; &gt; a sailboat with your T2 .. :-)
&gt;
&gt; Unless using a canoe as a wind resistance reduction device. In this case
&gt; the &quot;port and starboard&quot; of the canoe are reversed due to inversion.
&gt;
&gt; Right Bob?

one way as wind resistance reduction device.
opposite way when used as
water resistance floatation device

don't know about left/right etc. I sailed for a number of years and never
really had any problems with port/starboard...

dah stuff over yonder is starboard, and da other stuff right der is port.
