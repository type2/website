Subject: [T2] fuel injectors cleaning

Does anyone know where I can bring my injectors to get them cleaned? 
I'm in Long Beach, CA.  I went to some auto shop and Pep Boys and
neither of them do it.  I understand that they would also need a test
setup to hook up the injectors...  I know I can do it while the
injectors are in the engine, but that's kinda tedious.  I have four
extra injectors that I'd like to get tested and cleaned and then swap
them in.


Thanks,
mike
