Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel tank return fuel nipple (converting to FI)

Ben,

Get the tank...it will be easier and better.  Can't imagine the t working 
well at all.

Only thing on going to FI would be that you will want the front top engine 
cover plate as it already has a hole in the right place for the pressure
regulator return.

Do you have a cutout where the ecu connects to the wiring harness and 
hides behind a panel?

1.7 heads may have different valve sizes than the 2.0l heads that were 
designed for FI.

Probably a few other gotchas, bu probably not too bad.

Cheers and good luck, dave

&gt; Hi guys,
&gt; Would the pressure be to much and overflow at the end of that line 
&gt; (going into the air filter) instead of going into the tank?
&gt; 
&gt; drilled&quot; for the head temp sender.
&gt; Is it a problem if the FI was design for a 2.0L, i have a 1.7L
