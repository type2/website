Subject: Re: Need Brake Booster

Christian,
I just had my second one in two months go out.  I figure that 30 years is a 
long enough life for the rubber diaphram in the booster.  You could replace 
it with a junk yard find but you could be in the same boat again shortly.  My 
advice is spend once, cry once.  A rebuilt one will run you about $200.00 
with about a $50.00 core charge on top of that.  After doing lots of shopping 
I found a great deal with Carparts_dot_com.  $129.00 and no sales tax for you 
since you live out of state.  The core charge is $40.00 and they say shipping 
is about 10% but I got them to reduce that to about $7.00.  I say since 
brakes are &quot;kinda&quot; important spend the bucks.

Don
