Subject: Re: [T2] Annapolis MD Mechanic/Body Work Needed

She's good, and practical.  We have 3 drivers in the house, and 3  
cars counting the bus.  She really does not want another car around,  
so this is the best option.  And the bus has some sentimental value  
in the family, it was my Uncle's and he bought it new in '68.

Oh, and she tried to run it out of water, but it didn't work :-)
