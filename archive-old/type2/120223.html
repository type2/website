very true. only problem is it won't indicate that the 2nd battery is
not charging, unless it completely kills any/all accessories that are
on that battery. Now that I have thought all about it again, and since
I have several things running off my 2nd battery I'm gonna bite the
bullet and get an isolator.

&gt; It's probably useful to stick an ammeter in the circuit if you're doing 
&gt; any sort of repair (or fresh installation) work on your battery 
&gt; isolator set-up, because then you can see *exactly* what is going on.

just fyi. unless it's a very good ammeter it will burn out any of the
vom style. these only will accept small current flow. not 90 amps.
