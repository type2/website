Subject: Can't Handle the Project! '77 Westy for Sale

Project Bus for Sale!

After going though a rebuild for the '79 Westy, I have decided I don't
have the time or resources to rejuvenate the '77.  I guess I learned a
lesson about buying two buses at once! The '77 has potential for some
who does, so I have decided to offer it to the list first.

This bus is a project for someone with the time and resources to
rescue a '77 Westy.  I want to point out here and now it has some
significant problems, but nothing that can't be overcome.

Some problems:

2.0 Fuel Injected Engine has no compression.  I got it to turn over,
but not start.  Body has rust issues, but the interior is in fairly
good shape.  Has original curtains, back bench with cushions.  Has
sink and and fridge, don't know if they work.  Back bench works fine
and has original plaid.  Upper bunk is in good shape as is pop-top
Fiberglas.  Canvas is shot.  Pop Top mechanism functions well. Slider
Door is off the track at the bottom and the bottom slider bracket is
cracked.  I think it has Beetle front seats.  This was a party bus at
some point.

I'm am not trying to suger-coat anything, but this could be a nice bus
for someone who knows what they are doing.  Original color was Merino
Yellow.  Would be great to see it back on the road.   $1500.  Clean
Title and vehicle located in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

I have some good pictures.  Pmail me at pnocean_at_earthlink_dot_net.

I also just replaced the original seatbelts in the '79 with the
GoWesty 3-point retractables. (Sweet.)  If anyone wants a set of
original '79 belts, shoot me a pmail and we can work soemthing if you
pay shipping.  I am in South Bend, IN.
