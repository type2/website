&gt; Has anyone ever tried to rig a second battery to operate say...radio,

Hi, I had the same idea just recently, and found the Westfalia Owners Web Site
offering a detailed discussion. Go to &lt;http://www.westfalia_dot_org&gt; and go to the
message board page, find the Special Westy Wiring topic under the Electrical
section, open it and you shall find a flaming folder, named 'Second Battery'.
Enjoy it w/ a cup of coffee/tea!

Another great reading is at &lt;http://www.type2_dot_com/library/library.htm&gt; under
Batteries regarding auxiliary battery.

I have since then purchased a 2nd battery hook-up kit from JC Whitney's website.
Being a not so deligent restorer, I havn't dealt into the batteries hookup yet,
and just opened the package only after reading your post!

More power to ya....
Ricky
