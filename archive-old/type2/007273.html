Subject: A weekly 'ignorance is not bliss&quot; reminder
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

The response to my offer to post a weekly list of maintenance items, 
aimed primarily at newbies but also useful as a kick in the knee for the 
rest of us, was not overwhelming but it was enthusiastic. So I am going 
to go ahead and start it. Steve, our list administrator, gave his 
blessing, especially if there is some seasonal content to it.

So, I will begin posting this message every week, probably on Wednesdays 
as a reminder to plan work for the weekend. It will have a subject 
heading in the same form that George Lyle uses: all caps. If you have 
done everything that needs to be done to make your bus safe and reliable, 
by all means delete the message each week without reading it. Curse me 
between your teeth. I can take it.

The list will take the same form every week: preventative maintenance in 
three categories, plus an maintenance item that is keyed to the season.

First level maintenance: those items that, left untended, can and 
probably will lead to catastrophic failure (such as fuel hoses).

Second level maintenance: items that are cheap to maintain but become 
expensive to deal with if maintenance is ignored (such as CV boots and CV 
joints).

Third level maintenance: Items that type2 owners wished they had replaced 
before being stranded in the desert, in a parking lot, on the interestate 
at 3 am, etc. (accelerator cables)

Seasonal maintenance: Changing oil weights with the seasons, tires, 
heater parts, etc. etc.

Let me make clear right now: I am no Bob Hoover. I am not doing this 
because I have extensive knowledge of type2s, but because I have very 
little. I will be organizing my ongoing experience, and those of others. 
To that end, I need to hear from you with suggestions for the list. Send 
them to me via p-mail. 

Unlike the &quot;busted bus&quot; approach, I will succeed in this if you never 
have reason to thank me -- because your bus doesn't break down and you won't 
need help.

Of course, the busted bus approach will always be needed.
