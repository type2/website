[...] I don't think the screen/seal is available (if it is, let me 
know).  I went to a craft supply store and bought some black plastic 
needlepoint mesh.  Cut it to shape.  Since the peices of mesh available 
to me were too small to do the whole thing in one piece, I &quot;sewed&quot; them 
together with monofilament fishing line.  It's been in there for years, 
and has worked well.

&gt; Anybody have any luck finding a front grill and screen for a '68-'72 Bus?
&gt; Does anybody know if a 73-79 grill will fit??? I could maybe make do with
&gt; the grill but the screen and seal is FUBAR.
