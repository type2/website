&gt;Anyway~She's got a double carb engine but I was wanting to ask 
&gt;how to tell if it's a 1700 or an 1800??

Locate the engine code on the fan housing.  The first 2 characters can be
looked up in the manuals (or answered on the list) to tell you what
year/size your engine WAS.  But there is no way short of removing the heads
to tell what size it truly is.  

I thought I had a 1700 because it was a 73 and had the engine code for a
1700.  So when I rebuilt it, I ordered heads for a 1700 and was quite
surprised when I discovered they would not fit on the cylinders!  Had to
spend another $50 to have a local machine shop cut them to fit.  Bummer.

&gt;One other thing, she is needing her engine compartment seal
&gt;replaced......this is going to require me dropping the entire engine 
&gt;to get the seal 'round right?

That one's a snap.  The seal goes in after the engine is in place.  So if
the old one is still there (sorta), just pull it out and install the new one
(from the top side).  If you look at a cross section of the seal, it looks
like a sideways &quot;H&quot;.  One side gets stuffed in through the gap between the
engine sheetmetal and the engine compartment metal and the other side stays
on top so it sandwiches the metal between it.  Takes about 10 minutes to
install one.
