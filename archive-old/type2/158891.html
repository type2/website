Subject: Re: [T2] Are the Asian CV joints any good?

My employer, while

&gt;touring the factory also saw evidence that companies like Lobro are now
&gt;contracting with them for their replacement inventories for other vehicle
&gt;makes that Lobro originally supplied to.  Get with it folks, more and more
&gt;&quot;OE&quot; stuff is beginning to be funneled through Germany/Europe from sources
&gt;such as China and will increase as time goes on.
&gt;

All sorts of &quot;OEM parts&quot; are made by 3rd party suppliers. A local
company Fleetguard makes big diesel oil filters for about 6-7 OEMs...
Weird but true.
