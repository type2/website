Subject: FS: NOS Type 4 GERMAN heads

Well I'm in need of cash for the syncro so some of my long hoarded stuff needs to go, subject says it all basically.  In pricing these I did a quick scan of the all new and pretty cool Bus Depot website and was amazed that it lists new heads, and equally amazed at the cost, I've priced these lower than new ??? accordingly.  These are my set of NOS 1700 heads, cut to fit 1.8 or 2.0 applications.  Valve sizes are 39 x 33 a bit of an upgrade for a 2.0 8-) downgrade for a 1.8 :-(  These are all new, and all German with the exception of the exhaust valves (sorry keeping my sodium exausts.)  That is NEW, NEW, NEW, GERMAN, GERMAN, GERMAN.  Heads, guides, seats, intakes, springs, retainers, all as they left the fatherland so long ago.  Good quality exhausts, but not sodium.  One head is drilled and tapped for the FI head sensor.  These were non air injection, non breather 1700 heads so nothing to plug up, as cut will bolt on any stock 2.0 application for full GERMAN service life.  Yeah you
 can buy remanufactured or new ??? but I personally warrant you'll get no more than 75k from either, these are 200k mile heads if treated well in a properly built cool running T4.
 
$350 each, assembled and ready to bolt on.
 
If you like I will also sell a set of 96mm real NPR pistons and cylinders, for the 2.0 crank.  These I used back in '89 (no kidding) for about 1500 miles in my 914 before putting it into a tree.  They are basically as new, I mean the barrels didn't even get a chance to surface rust (in WV BTW so that is amazing.)  Unfortunately over the years one of the pistons strayed from it's barrel and the 2nd ring got chipped.  So I'd like $225 for set with a set of new Total seal 2nds, or $175 as is and you find your own ring or rings.  With the new 2nds this set will be no different than new.  Much better than the current Asian junk being tossed about.  Although I'd like to sell this stuff I'm certainly not in a rush to do so, reasonable offers will be considered but dreamers need not apply.
