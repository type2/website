 Hi Rick,
You shouldn't have any trouble fitting a 1600 to your 2.0l box but there will be some other changes as well as the engine.
You will need a 1600 bell housing &amp; a 1600 starter motor, although both are easy to find because every model up until the 2.0l buses ran these 2 items &amp; the 70's Beetles also ran that starter motor &amp; possibly even the bell housing as well(correct me if I'm wrong).
The bell housing &amp; starter motor  changed for the 2.0l.
As far as the vacuum assist goes, there should be a small pipe leading off the carb that you connect your vaccum assist to.
Remember, even after '72 Single &amp; Dual Cab pick ups still were available, paradoxically, with 1600s.
Anyone would think you'd need the extra horses from the 2.0l for a work vehicle but obviously fuel efficiency was more important than power or speed.

Cheers

change out the 2l dual carb motor to a 1600 what will change? I know its a 
small motor but thats the way they came over here in Germany and they 
lasted....
Peace Out
Rick
