Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Shore Power&quot; to charge 2nd Battery or power 12v stuff

I use a 50 amp 120 to 12v converter I found at a yard sale.  Nice clean
filtering to give straight DC even to a TV.  I installed a single pole
double throw switch (also known as a 2-way switch at the Home Depot
electrical dept) which connects all the 12v stuff I use to either the
converter or the spare battery.  With a 14v output, it can be used to
charge a battery.  You could use a $50 10 AMP charger hooked in
parallel, and the battery will act as a capacitor to minimize any
effects of interference on TV's or sound- A charger (in manual mode)
will power a fridge, fl. light, a fan, the radio, and a TV, but by
itself the power is not filtered and will cause patterns on a TV.  In
our 78, the original 4 Amp fridge power supply also powered my fan and
fl. light.
