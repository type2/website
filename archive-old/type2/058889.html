Volks,

One more message on this topic and then we'll take it to pmail except 
for maybe a weekly reminder until the show.

Our private campground option fell through (thanks to Dennis Farr 
for offering to check) so it's definitely Hillsborough River State 
Park for those who would prefer something further from I-75.  The 
park is on US 301 south of Zephyrhills and north of Thonotosassa.

(You think I'm making those names up, don't you?)

Please make your own reservations and we'll try to congregate in some 
fashion as we arrive.  Bloc camping has its moments, but then you'll 
be wanting to sleep, so it's often more fun and more diverse if there 
are little pockets of Dubdom scattered through the woods like 
campfires.  Besides, I snore.

I plan to drive down Friday &amp; hopefully arrive midafternoon for some 
relaxing.  Both the Bulli Brigade and the Bug Jam are 20-30 minutes 
tent flap to front gate.

For more info, check out http://tampa.info-access_dot_com/hills.htm.  The 
official park page has rates and phone numbers:

html.

I sure hope to see you there.

PS: For those whose drive allows it, detour off I-75 east on US 98 
towards Brooksville, then south on State Road 41 all the way through 
to Dade City.  Maybe an hour's drive.  Pretty country.
