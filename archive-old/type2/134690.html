&gt; Don't know if it is true or not.  But supposedly if you change the design
&gt; (ever so slightly) you should be safe :)
&gt; Any one know if this is true?

There's no &quot;10% change&quot; rule in US copyright law.  There's a misconception
that you can change something a little and it's not a violation of the
copyright.  The law is written so that it's pretty much up to the perception
of the copyright owner whether or not you've violated their property right
to the copyrighted item.

If they think you've violated their copyright, you have until otherwise
proven in court.  And since most jealously guarded copyrights have wealthy
owners behind them (along with well-paid lawyers), you stand very little
chance of winning a case against them.

I've got a small piece on it at my website, as well as links to the US
Copyright site:

I just got carried away by the prospect of an item that's so much in demand.
My bad.
