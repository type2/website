Hey everyone!
This is the Greatest Place in the world for &quot;HELP&quot; &amp; wouldnt you know it, I
need your help again!?!
       I have a 77 Transporter, automatic.  Every evening when I go home &amp;
turn on my headlights I melt (not blow) a fuse, red 3rd from the right on
the fuse box under the dash!
10 Amp I presume, Oh yeah besides that short, my Hazerd switch is shorted,
to the point I have to fiddle with it to get my Turn Signals to
work,,,Hmmmm,, any affiliation??
Thanks a bunch!!!
