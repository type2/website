&gt; ok, so I check my pertronix points again and see that they are about 42

Pertronix dwell is around 54 degrees.
 
&gt; Narrower gap means more dwell and a wider gap means less dwell.

True.

&gt; 44 is the lower limit according to bentley...so I check the gap on the
&gt; pertronix and it is pretty close to the specified .030...I narrow it to
&gt; almost nothing and the dwell doesn't change....I widen it to the max and
&gt; the dwell doesn't change...but! the timing changes a lot...go figure...

The air gap is a source of misinformation on the web. It only has to be
large enough not to rub.

&gt; The question is, on regular points, do the points wear to a larger or
&gt; smaller dwell number?

As the rubbing block wears, the gap gets smaller. The page you referenced
explains:

Taking it to extremes, excessive dwell means that the points close too soon
after opening, cutting off the magnetic field collapse before it delivers
all its energy. Too little dwell gives the magnetic flux insufficient time
to build up to the maximum. Both conditions give a a weak spark which gets
even weaker as the engine RPM rises and produces misfiring at normal
operating speeds.
