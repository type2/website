&gt;Dunno about NOS. Never tried it. Too many safety concerns about carrying a

&gt;Wait - I carry propane everywhere under my Westy....

Yeah, and a gas tank too!  How many BTUs are in there??

&gt;Anywho - I guess it would work. I don't know how long your engine would 
&gt;work though...

Compared to the other poweradders (turbo, blower) I think nitrous is 
well-suited to an aircooled vw since it cools the intake charge rather than 
heats it and is only used in short bursts.  It's something I would like to 
try someday when I have time to do frivolous things (well, substantial 
frivolous things).
