Subject: FS: Custom 2L T4 engine in a 73 W/ lots of spare part - Moving
  Sale - $2600 OBO

I am selling my 73 Bus. It has a modified 79 2L T4 engine with low miles. 
(I used mostly German parts when building the engine)

- Dual 40 Dells with update kit.
- 009 with Electronic Ignition 
- Allison Red coil
- Custom 914 Bursch racing exhaust with turbo muffler
- Porsche windage tray
- Full balance
- Custom cam
- I installed a Vanagon oil dip stick tube to eliminate the problematic 
rubber boot on the T4 engines.
- Head temp gauge head: temps in the 220 to 250
- All tin in place and thermostat works correctly
- Engine has about 47,000 miles
- It has a 5 rib 79 091 transmission.
- It has 78 sliding windows in the middle
- eliminated the wing vents on the drivers side rear window.
- Wired with an amp under the rear seat and speakers in the panel in front of 
the rear seat.

Plus:
- Spare 2L short block 
- Spare set of square port heads
- Spare special 914 cam
- Spare set of valve springs
- 2 spare 091 gearboxes (One good and the other one has a bad reverse shaft 
bearing)

- It has a larger capacity '79 fuel tank
- All window and body rubber (except front doors) have lifetime transferable 
warranty from Westcoast Metric.
- The engine door has a lock with key.
- Tires are in good shape with lots of tread.
- Brakes are good.
- Runs good.


The bad:
- The sliding door and side has a dent.
- There is rust on the roof and other places.
- Paint is faded on roof and sides.
- The rear bumper is bent on one edge.

**I would not hesitate to hop in and drive the van across country.

I am moving and cannot drive three vehicles across country, so this van needs 
to go.
