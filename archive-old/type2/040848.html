Subject: oil light circuit Q update

Thanks to George, Scott, Andy and Mike I cobbled the beeper as follows:
wrapped the RED lead around the wire that puts power in to the warning
light/turnsignal bulb assembly (this makes sense if you look under your
dash :)  ), black one wrapped around the wire that leads to the oil light
BULB. This works, but is ugly and not permanammanennt &lt;---bugs bunny voice.
At least I know how it goes now.

Originally, I REALLY wanted to be elegant, and use my door buzzer; no extra
bits, and using an unused existing part. Seemed easy, but....

the door buzzer gets its power straight from the fuse box, goes to the
switch in the jamb and then apparently to ground when the door opens.
However, it looks like there is a wire from the ignition switch that also
goes to the doorjamb switch. I am guessing this is some sort of weird
three-pole circuit?
Any ideas on how I might be able to adapt the door buzzer circuit to do my
bidding?  Buzzer is 12v .15A, so it may simply draw too much
current..........
