Subject: *Zappppppp* 


Oh god, my eyes are still rolling....

So i went to visit the bus and my curiosity got the best of me, again. For
some reason, I never noticed that little silver thingy under neither the
glove box on the passenger side.... no mention of it in the manual...
hrmm, lemme get a screw driver and see what it'll do when I poke it....

*ZAPPPPPPPPPPPPPP*

so, yeah, I discovered the silly little 12 volt accessory socket, and not
in the most pleasant of methods... damn curiosity... gonna get me killed
one day...

so, here is my question. after doing some research (after letting the
fillings in my teeth reharden from the nice electric shock) it *looks*
like one of the BMW/Hella sockets should fit this? Anyone know? I was
thinking about using some of the BMW motorcycle gear for *really* cold
driving....
