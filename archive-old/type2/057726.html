Subject: NEEDED: crossover pipe and EGR Filter
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

My 79 bus is running GREAT after I installed my new engine.  Problem:  I
cannot pass the emissions inspection here in Virginia, because I have a
large hole in my &quot;cross-over&quot; pipe (the 'U' shaped pipe that leads to the
muffler.  Also has mounting for the EGR filter).  The VW shop around here
said it was discontinued.  they can get it, but it will cost $400.  FOR AN
8&quot; 'U' SHAPED PIPE!!!

Does anyone have a new/used one I could have/buy?  Additionally, the EGR
filter was missing from my bus. I was told that this is a checklist item on
the emissions inspection.  It is also discontinued, and to get a used one,
the shop said it would be ~$250.

I have looked at junk yards in the area with no avail.

My next step is to take the pipe to see if I can get it weilded.

Your help is GREATLY appreciated!
