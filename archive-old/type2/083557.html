Subject: Tire Thread FAQ page

Rather than doing what I should be doing, trying
to get my small business matters in order.  I've
been fooling around with my ezbake webpage.  A
few more folks asked about the tires and of
course there has been the usual tire thread
traffic so I posted my little spin here:

http://www.geocities_dot_com/nemobuscaptain/tires.html

I'm going to search the archives soon and try to
put together the usual arguments and debate and
post it on a linked page as well.  I'll try to
keep it updated with recent experiences etc, so
that newbies have a place to go to answer their
questions.  Check it out and send comments
offlist please.

Peace and blessings,
