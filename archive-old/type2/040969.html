Subject: Aux Battery Connections

   Hi All.

I just installed and aux battery under the rear seat of the Westy. There was
already a solinoid mounted there as well as a ground strap and battery hold
down.(I have a BN4 in the engine compartment).
I ran a wire to the + side of the coil to &quot;:Pic&quot; the solinoid for power when
the ignition is on. Since this causes my driving battery and aux to connect
together for charging i'm afraid it'll drain down the main upon starting?
Also is my altornator strong enogh to charge 2 Batteries together? Not sure
of the output has the round rubber air boot.
   I haven;t hooked up anything to the aux battery yet as i want to know if
the charging side is right first.

Any hints on where to pic for solinoid power?
Any suggestions?

Thanks
