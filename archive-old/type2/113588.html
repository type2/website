Subject: Re: [T2] ordered tires...interesting

&gt; &gt; Sleepers - now those I REALLY like the best. Quiet and normal looking until
&gt; &gt; the hammer is put down... GOODBYE!
&gt;
&gt;That's it!  Ridin' tall in the saddle with a Porsche or Subaru 6 in the
&gt;rear for giddy-up!

Or a Corvair... (I hope this project turns out as good as the folks I have 
talked to that have done it before).

Worry not folks - no VW bus will be harmed in this project. All bolt in and 
modified Corvair stuff. Everything VW will be bagged, marked and saved for 
later when VW busses are worth $60K with a stock drivetrain and $2500 for a 
Trans-Vair powered one... &lt;grin&gt;

Let's see - my estimated completion date is 2013...
