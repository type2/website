&lt;&lt; so I jiggle it around a little and a strange 
 piece fell out.  The piece looks like two opposing hooks with a spring 
 attatched that are connected in the middle so they open and close I 
 think.  After it fell out, the door closed just fine.  &gt;&gt;

Months ago a similar thing happened on the Pumpkin - cargo door had gotten
progressively harder to close.  Then one day I shouldered it shut REAL hard,
and a little white plastic widget fell out.  Not able to see where it came
from or any damage done, and in a hurry anyway, I tried the door and it
closed up tight!  I guess some widgets are dispensible...

Then just today, the door refused to seal completely at the back edge :(  &quot;oh
no, this must be the price I pay&quot; methinks.  Inspection showed that one of
the screws holding the closing mechanism had fallen out and the other was
loose!  47 cents bought two new bolts, door closes with a flick of the wrist
again!  So the two incidents are likely unrelated, and I say, &quot;If it works,
don't fix it.&quot;

Don't worry, be happy!
