Subject: Re: [T2] Help!!!!!!

Troy,

Two choices....get the bently manual and start rewiring, or I can take a
picture(probably several) of mine(78 also) and put them out where you can
see them on the net.

You were not explicit, though, do you *have* the fuse box and other parts?

It just so happens that I was going thru the electrical on mine today and
have the fuse box loose.  I can shoot a couple of pics and upload them to
my site by Sunday or so.

Would that work?

Cheers ,dave

&gt; 	Hello all....I have a '78 type2 with 2.0FI......The problem is that the
&gt; dashboard is not in place and none of the wiring up front is connected.
&gt; Nothing to the fuse box, steering column, or anything.  The wiring at the
&gt; back of the bus is connected correctly, just the front connections need to
&gt; be made.  Its a mess and I don't know where to start to get the wiring
&gt; sorted and connected.  Can anyone help??????  Thanks everyone.
