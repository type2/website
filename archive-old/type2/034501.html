Subject: Value estimate...

Hello,

I'm looking at a '79 transporter and was wondering about the approximate
value. I realize it's tough to gauge without actually seeing the vehicle but
a rough guess would be helpful.

As I said, it's a '79......89,000 miles on the vehicle itself.

Fuel injected and seems to run very smooth and strong. (the engine was
rebuilt a couple thousand miles ago)

It has a few body dings but nothing major and only a minor rust.

One of the seats is missing, the bench seat right behind the driver.

It needs some attention and there is some work to be done but all in all it
seems to be pretty sound.

What would be a fair price to pay for this?

Thanks,
Bill
