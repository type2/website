Stephen,
    Years ago, when we had a 77 bus,  I had a similar problem.  In the
end it turned out to be the  hinge at the bottom of the gas pedal.
Dirt and debris collects there and causes rust in the hinge.  I'd say
remove the front floor mat, vacuum out around the gas pedal hinge,
inspect for general condition as well as for rust, lubricate it good
and see if that helps the problem.  Don't forget to look at the front
side, under the pedal, too.  If not, work your way through the
accelerator system until you find the cause for your problem.  There
aren't that many parts, it won't take long.
