Just wanted to remind everyone that we are having our monthly bus club
meeting this Saturday, March 11 at Denny's on Wade Hampton Blvd at
1pm... 

This past weekend, the Hippy Daze VW Road Rally stopped at Vintage Auto,
where I work. Several people asked me about the new bus club, so I'm
expecting a big turnout this weekend...

The weather is getting warm, and lotsa VW's are coming out of
hibernation!
