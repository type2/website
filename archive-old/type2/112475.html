Subject: Re: [T2] Dead coil?  Weird coincidence!

Borrowed coil installed, good spark from it.  Still doesn't start.

I guess at this point, I need to check that the cylinders are actually 
getting fuel, so this is where I get to learn about the Bosch FI, I 
guess.  I went hunting for loose/disconnected wires and came up empty, 
so I guess it's time to go through the FI diagnostic procedures in the 
Bentley manual.

Sigh, and I just had the fuel lines replaced by my mechanic when it was 
there having exhaust work done.

Does anyone have suggestions of &quot;usual suspects&quot; for fuel system 
problems?

Also, I'm having trouble spotting the fuel pump/filter... I thought it 
was underneath the Bus logically in front of the #1 cylinder... could 
be the angle I'm looking up due to the Bus being parked next to a curb. 
  Can someone describe the precise location to give me a better chance 
of finding it (I have a '76)?

Thanks!
