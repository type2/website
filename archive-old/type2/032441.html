Howdy Folks,
Tonight I attempt painting my new '66 camper.  I have NEVER painted a car before, but then again there are lots of things I had previously never done before owning 3 air-cooled VW's.  Plus I am an adventurous soul.  Anyway I have all the tools, respirator, paint gun, compressor, etc.  I am looking for a good resource with information about car painting.  Either someone who has done it themselves that can give me some tips or can direct me to a good web site with some helpful tips for the first-timer.  Wish me luck, if all goes well, this time tomorrow I will have a two-tone Mouse Gray\Pearl White decent-looking bus, instead of the flat gray primer color it now is!



Peace, John Baker
