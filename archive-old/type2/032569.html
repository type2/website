Hi Chris;

We currently run a 1970 Campmobile, and previously had a 1968, plus have 
experience with friends' '68 through '72 Westfalia Campmobiles.

The apparently &quot;standard&quot; setup inside the iceboxes is the wire rack you 
mention, plus a very lightly made and flimsy tray to catch meltwater from the 
ice.  

This tray has a nipple at the right rear corner, where a plastic drain hose 
attaches.  This drain hose ultimately exits through a hole in the floor of the 
bus.  That hose, by the way, needs to be reamed out from time to time to clear 
out mold and crud that blocks it and prevents proper meltwater drainage.

I've never seen one of these trays, except in a brand new camper back in the 
60s and 70s, that wasn't cracked.  Apparently most folks try to use it to hold 
the ice, and it's just not strong enough to support the weight.  The 
Campmobile manual we have that came with our '70 makes no reference to the 
interior fittings in the ice box, so there's no guidance from Westfalia on the 
matter.

Early on we tried packing canned goods and hard packaged stuff under the tray 
so it's weight would be supported by the goods underneath and also support the 
ice's weight.  That worked for a day or two, but then became a hassle to 
maintain.  Since then we've used the wire rack to hold 1 or 2 bags of ice, 
with durably packaged food on top of the ice.  Most of the meltwater drains 
into the tray and out under the bus.  The tray is too shallow to prevent 
meltwater from sloshing over the sides on windy roads, so some moisture gets 
into the area under the tray.  It's not an entirely satisfactory solution, but 
seems to make the best of the stock icebox installation.

If you're referring to a manual pump, which would have been original to your 
'71, there's 3 possible &quot;leaks&quot;.  

Water often leaks at the base of the spout.  This is readily fixed with 
renewal of the O-ring seal(s).  These pumps vary in internal details, so you 
have to do some creative thinking, but it's not difficult.  Take the offending 
parts with you to the hardware store to get 
O-ring sizes that fit your particular pump.

Another &quot;leak&quot; is in the check valve in the base of the pump.  This is just a 
ball that rests in a seat cast into the pump base.  If it gets gummed up with 
residue from hard water, etc., it won't seal and the pump loses it's prime.  
All that's usually needed is a good cleaning to restore it's seal.

A 3rd &quot;leak&quot; would be from a cracked pump body.  These can be patched up with 
a sealant appropriate for use with potable water, but the design of these 
pumps is such that a crack repair is doomed to fail again.

I've replaced several of these pumps with new units from marine supply stores 
and RV supply outlets.  The quality varies widely, even though they all seem 
to cost between $15.00 and $20.00.  I've found pumps that looked identical to 
each other, but one was a chromed metal casting and the other was a &quot;chrome&quot; 
plastic molding.  The internal linkage and piston design and construction also 
varies widely, which probably explains why repair kits are not available.  
Unfortunately, short of dis-assembling a new pump in the store there's no way 
to check the quality of the internal bits.

A few years ago I installed a new pump in our Campmobile and was pleased that 
it fit and looked like a new Westfalia pump though I'd bought it at an RV 
supply for $15.00.  The 3rd night of a 2-week journey it failed.  The internal 
link between the handle and piston was very flimsy plastic and snapped in two. 
 I repaired it with a new link fabricated from coat hanger wire, and it worked 
fine for the rest of the trip. When we got home I took it back, and they 
exchanged it for a new pump.  Ironically, the new pump looks identical to the 
pump that failed, and was packaged and priced identically.  Yet the internal 
linkage is metal, the piston is nylon rather than plastic, and it still 
functions OK.

Hope this helps.....

----------
I am trying to find the ice tray (that holds the block of ice to keep things 
&quot;cool&quot; in there) for my 1971 Campmobile icebox.  I have the rack (with the 
&quot;guardrails&quot; all around it) and I am wondering if there's any other hardware 
that goes inside the icebox.  I contacted the folks at Euro American RV (at 
deltasix_at_earthlink_dot_net) and they couldn't help me.  They did have a new pump 
to replace my leaky one, but I had requested a repair kit (no such luck).  

Any of you guys have any tips on repairing a leaky faucet pump?  

Thanks.
