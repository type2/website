&gt; I speculate that the &quot;remanufactured&quot; units were just as new (perhaps up to

Could also have nothing to do with the US...

Another HUGE market for VW parts is central and south america.  A lot of
these countries have EXTREMELY high tariffs on imported cars and car parts
to encourage local production/fill the governments pockets.  In Costa rica
i priced a new 34 pict 3. With taxes it was $228.00.  Here they can be
found from $130-150 depending on where you look.

I know many other countries in this area have a) similar rules b) a lot of
VW's on the road. (we saw so many in costa-rica that a bus sighting became
nothing special, and they had a ban on VW imports for many years...)
perhaps the reman. parts get around the high new parts tariffs in these
countries... and it is economically unfeasable for Bosch to make 2
different products for latin american and US distribution, so they
standardize on &quot;remanufactured.&quot;
