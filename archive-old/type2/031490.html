&gt;  I have a question for the list.  I have a chance to purchase a '72

in theory it is the 1700cc typeIV engine, real odd ball 72-73 only 

&gt; would be a good asking price?  The condition is pretty bad..... the
&gt; is completely rusty, not eaten through, but bad rusty..... and there are
&gt; spots of rust all over the body, but the body is straight and feels
&gt; fairly solid, it is sitting on 4 flat tires so could not get underneath
&gt; to see the condition there.. I can only imagine from the rest.  Insides

I wouldn't even consider it until I saw underneath, check the front tubes
real well,  get the Dr Tim checklist from the archives on how to check out
a potential buy

&gt; licensed since '86, but did start and run last year.  any ideas would be

so they say, it ran, did you hear it??

$200 would be too much, what are they asking for??

sounds like this Westy needs a lot of TLC, you have time or money to make
it happen???  more likely it is a &quot;parts&quot; bus for a good one you haven't
found yet

lets run some numbers

tires   250-400
engine  $1200+
battery  50
fuel line, brakes  150
roof canvas  ??
rust repair, 50-100 hours at ?? per hour
and that is only what you see
