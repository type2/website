Subject: Re: [T2] Pop out rear window


&gt; Kevin,
&gt;
&gt; For some reason the T2 server is rejecting responses from my e-mail
server, even though I'm getting stuff from the list. Could you possibly post
this response.
&gt;
&gt; California Import parts has these pop-outs, already here in the states, in
white or chrome. Here's the link to the white ones:

&gt;
&gt; I do, however, agree with Kevin - you may want to check to see what
shipping costs are, because £165 approximately equals $234.
