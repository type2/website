I think the hype over noxious and, or deadly fumes with halon type units is 
myth.
I've been in the fire ext. ind. for well over 6yrs now and highly recommend  
these type units for people trying to protect their investments.  Halon type 
units one do not leave a residue like dry- chemical.  Halon 1211 and 1301 
were some of the best chemicals ever made to fight fire, unfortunately they 
eat our ozone.  I now recommend the use of a new chemical  called Halotron 
which is the new replacement for these two chemicals.  It is approved by the 
military and the FAA for use in airplanes and navy vessels.  It is only sold 
though thru Fire Equip. dealers like me. Any type chemical when used in 
confined spaces will cause respiratory problems.  Most likely though none of 
us will be fighting a fire on our bus in closed quarters. I carry Halotron on 
my bus along with a drychem ext. too.  Any of you that are interested in info 
on Halotron or purchasing a unit can contact me.
