Subject: Re: [T2] Trip South, through Florida, back to Washington DC

If you are traveling south, Orlando and Tampa have
several them parks. If you are headed down to Miami, I
strongly suggest taking the Turnpike from Orlando or
I-95 south (a bit more traffic). You can also take
1-75, the problem with that is that it becomes a
isolated road (ALligator Alley) stretching across
Florida, if your bus breaks down there, you would be
in bad shape.

If you want to head down to Miami/Ft. Lauderdale, I
can send you a separate email with places in so. fla
so that we dont clog up the list.
