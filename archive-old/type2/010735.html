1979 (Converted to Westy) Bus. This was a standard sunroof 2.0L 4sp. bus
that has had the sunroof removed and a 1973 Westy pop-top added. (hinges at
the front and fold out cot.)From what Ive been told, It was a limited edition
California model with a tan upper, Dark brown lower and 3 colored stripes that
wrap around the front and down the sides. It had been a CA. van much of its
life before meand has very little rust.  It has a front mounted spare,
vanagon velour front seats, Denon AM/FM Cassette.  It's well maintained, runs
and drives great and is my family's weekend driver from April to October. (its
off the road now)
When I bought it I installed a low mileage rebuilt motor from a
rusty 1978 (with custom made stainless steel heater elbows)  I was going to
do a full westy upgrade this spring so included with the purchase of this
van are the following uninstalled parts I've collected so far: ( all 1976
Westy and good shape) Swivel seat bottom for passenger seat,  sink and water
tank entire cabinet assembly (dont know if the electric pump works or not,)
icebox and
storage cabinet assembly, swivel dining table, vertical cabinet with
mirrored door assembly, overhead pckage shelf assembly,  Fold out back seat
bed and cushion (that orange and green plaid color....sorry) Full set of
orange curtains and rods and snap straps, all snaps for around windshield,
childs cot and mounting brackets, rear screen,  AC power outlet cord and
hardware, The only thing I hadnt purchased yet were the crank-out side
windows so it still has the original sliders in the back. also included in
this amazing array of stuff is( If you want it.) a  1978 standard bus for
parts rusty slider and wheel wells  bad trans, engine out but inside,  Working
FI system, 2 Brains, flapper boxes etc. hubcaps, color coded brown rims, good
glass, front doors,
rear hatch, engine covers, also has under dash AC set-up and the hoses and
radiators underneath,  (the compressor was gone when I got it so I have no
idea if it works) Bumpers, headlights, etc, etc.  This parts bus will be
sent to the local picking yard if it is not sold.
Although the 1979 bus is in drive-away condition, it will probably need a
few minor things soon:
windshield has a crack (the one in the 78 is good)
gas guage re-calibrated (works for 1st half of tank only)
Rear shocks (getting soft)
the top canvas is a bit ratty (a few taped holes)
the fold out cot canvas is shot (looks like someone fell thru!)
and the muffler is probably on the last part of its lifespan.
It passed inspection this year with it though.
Also have a Stewart Warner Complete Gas heater For Sale.  I believe its for a
pre-72 bus though. Bought it off the net last year for $200 Make Offer
I'm only selling this stuff because I just got a 87 vanagon wolfsburg and I
need
the driveway space for this and my diesels
$2,500.00
please e-mail for details or offers may separate goodies for fair prices
Located 15 mi. north of the George Washington Bridge
