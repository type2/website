&gt;I plan on doing a subaru engine conversion in the future. Since I have
&gt;an '81 air-cooled model, I will need to install a radiator and the
&gt;associated plumbing.

This is a popular topic on the Vanagon list, I'm sure a search of their
archives (while dreadfully slow) would be productive:

Also I understand that Bob Hoover is hip-deep in a Subaru conversion right
now and last I heard he was stuck at the radiator, it would be groovy if he
could give us a taste if he sees this message on which I blind copied him.
