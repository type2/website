Subject: Parting out a mostly complete 78 bus

The story goes like this, this guy sold it to me for $500, swore up and 
down it would turn over and that he had been driving it just last fall. 
I thought he was a bit full of it, but figured for the price it would be 
a good parts bus at the very least since I had been looking at another 
'78. Then a sweet blue '74, in great shape, only needed a few minor 
repairs landed in my lap for $400, no way I could pass it up.  I have 
done most of the repairs on the '74 and she is about ready to become a 
daily driver.  Since at the moment I don't have the time or space to 
work on the '78 and after some closer inspection, most of the 
electricals on it where shot, some just turned to dust in my hand, not 
to mention I have scavanged a few parts off it for my self.

The rims on it are already spoken for, but other than that its up for 
grabs. most of the inside is in reasonable shape.. headliner is shot, as 
are some of the pannels, the seats are good, altho its missing the 
middle one, the body is fairly rusted in the normal spots.  The engine 
is almost complete,  I may be stealing the starter off it, but its all 
there save that. WIth a lot of body work and a new set of wiring it 
could be put back on the road. Or at least I haven't seen any thing that 
would sugest that it couldn't be. If soem one wants the whole thing, 
bring a set of wheels and we will send it along for you. if you need a 
part your more than welcome to come and pull it, you want to cut off the 
roof, bring a saw.

I would like to make back what I paid for it and put in to it in moving 
it and what not, but all told thats only about $700.  But more over I 
want to get it gone, its on the street in Brooklyn NY, and has my VT 
tags on it which is letting it sit where she is for a while, but its 
time to move it on. If I had the space I would keep it and do some thing 
with it,  but on the streets with winter just around the corner, and a 
three week trip coming up on the 5th of Aug, just don't have the time or 
space.
 
If any one is interested e-mail me off the list and we will see what we 
can work out for it.

Dave
