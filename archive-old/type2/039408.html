What we have here is a failure to communicate!

OK, in a Nutshell:

Ronnie F (who signs himself &quot;ronnie&quot;) runs a shop called &quot;Old Volks Home&quot;
in Lake Havasu City, AZ and has a site at http://www.oldvolks_dot_com.

Ron T (who signs himself &quot;Ron&quot;) runs a shop called &quot;The Bus Depot&quot; in
Perkiomenville, PA and has a site at http://www.busdepot_dot_com

An obvious case of too many Ronalds!  I've done business with both and
have no complaints.

Jim Thompson ran a business called Old Volks Home and had a web site at
http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/.  Despite the similarities in the name it has
no connection to Ronnie F's business, AFAIK.  There were several VW places
around that use that name.  It's kind of a natural!
