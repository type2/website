Subject:1974 bus for sale, bay area


1974 VOLKSWAGEN CAMPER VAN FOR SALE    $2,800
35 000 miles on a rebuilt engine. Dual carbuerrators. 
Pop-up camper roof, bed, ice box and sink. gorgeous airbrushed paintjob, 
multicolored. This is the rainbow bus some people may even recognise from 
its years of touring! 
I've owned the bus since nov. 97 only, and since then have put: new tires,
 rebuilt transmission, new gas and clutch cable, battery, and an assortment of
 air filter/smog parts.
The exterior has a tiny bit of rust/paint bubbles around the wheel wells but 
otherwise in great shape.
The interior is in nice shape and its a beauty to sleep in, although it is 
missing the little table and spicket. You may want to add a new rug, and I 
have a remnant you can fit in there.
Mechanically,there are no foreseeable problems with this bus, and the engine 
runs remarkably STRONG. It is a jewel with one obstacle yet to overcome- 
the smog test which narrowly failed recently, but may be passed by the time 
it is sold. I bought the bus without the smog and have invested in the 
original parts (they were searched out). So regisrtation is paid but without 
CA plates. There are a few ways to solve this, but I've decided that my 
journeys this year will now take me overseas, therefore the rainbow bus 
deserves a new home. If interested in driving her, please call Garrett 
at 415- 642 3435 or you can mail to garrett_at_hunab-ku_dot_com
