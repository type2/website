&gt;      Thanks for the advise.  Since my goal is the most reliable &amp; breakdown
&gt; free car possible, I bought new CV's.  I may have been able to make those
&gt; last but with my luck they would have failed catastrophically.  Probably in
&gt; the middle of nowhere in the lovely Oregon rain.  No thank you.  My garage
&gt; is dry &amp; my other car is available for parts running.  Thanks again.  BTW,
&gt; the new joint kit had the new circle clips.
Put the used ones and some grease kits under your back seat for a rainy
day.

Even though they are a little funky, they work.  And if the new ones
should let go at some point (3 years, 3 weeks, who knows) you will be
proud of yourself for having the spare and the grease right when you
needem :)

take care,

Steve
