Subject: HELP! need dual 34 weber jetting #'s

HI all, 

I'm trying to help my mechanic dial-in the dual 34 ITC
Weber kit on my otherwise all-stock 1700cc type 4
egnine in my 72 Westy.

I live in Los Angeles, so it's basically warm climate,
sea level. 

They put them on out of the box and unless I have the
gas pedal 2/3 of the way to the floor, it's sluggish
and bogs off the line. It works great if I drive it
like my 1835cc cal-bug I had in high school
(lead-foot), but that's not too healthy for anyone!

Anybody got some jetting fig's for this set-up? I
couldn't find anything in the library or archive.

Thanks
Jason
