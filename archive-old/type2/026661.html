Subject: Isolator vs. Relay

Hi again,

Well the last message worked, so here's another one.

Regarding the recent isolator vs. relay discussion, you might want to check
out the site at the end of this message.

They have comparison data on which works better.  (Since they mainly sell
isolators, guess which one they say is best?)  (I also noticed that they
don't happen to mention the 1 volt drop you get using the isolator.)
Basically, they say that relays work just as well as isolators at first,
until the contacts on the relays get burned or corroded.  They argue that's
why auto manufacturers went with breakerless ignition.  That true, but
here's a thought:  I live near the ocean so I get salty air.  I have to
periodically clean all my electrical connections like the fuse box, and I've
found it's easy to maintain relays by opening them up and cleaning the
contacts-just like points.  I don't use any silicone grease, like I do on
the spade connectors and fuses, but I polish them with 600 grit sand paper.
Works great.

Anyway, this vendor sells &quot;smart relays&quot; which will not connect the primary
crank battery to the aux one if the crank battery voltage is below a certain
point, say 13 volts.  This prevents the aux battery from sucking the juice
out of the crank battery.  They also have low voltage disconnect switches
that will automatically disconnect a battery if the voltage drops too far,
and low voltage switches that will automatically disconnect specific loads,
like headlights, if the voltage drops to far.  Finally, they have an a
device which sounds an alarm when the voltage drops to low.  Although I have
dual batteries, I think a low voltage disconnect would be great for a Westy
with only one battery.  These devices sound cool, and I'm already trying to
see how I might use em.

I used an isolator for many years in my 71 Westy without any problems.  I
found I could easily raise the voltage output of my stock regulator by
bending the tab on the relay contact inside.  Raising it one volt
compensated for the volt drop using the isolator.  Now, I'm going to use one
of those Bosch 52 amp alternators.  Does anyone know how to raise the
voltage on these puppies???

In any case, the isolator people say that for any Bosch alternator, you must
use a special isolator that has a &quot;R&quot; (regulator) terminal on it.  You also
have to modify the regulator so that it's sensor (D+) is connected to the
&quot;R&quot; terminal rather than the alternator.  They didn't know how to do this on
my model alternator, but they insisted that if I didn't, and just used the
regular isolator commonly sold, that I would actually lose another one volt
for a total of two volts drop!  I wonder if anyone has done this and is now
wondering why they can't fully charge their batteries?  If anyone has any
experience with this situation, I'd sure appreciate some help.

Here's the site for the isolator folks:  http://www.surepower_dot_com
