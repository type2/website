Subject: Alternator and EGR Light on, 77 automatic.

List guru's; I'm looking for where and how to
troubleshoot the Alternator and the EGR light, both
on, in my 77 automatic.

Just finished putting in a rebuilt automatic
transmission, had motor out and replaced fule filler
neck and all associate lines.

Got motor back in, all working great, except for the
two lights on....

1.  Is it possible I &quot;crossed&quot; the two wires leading
to the thingy ((regulator?) on the firewall ?
2.  Battery sat for 9 months while I hunted for
transmission and time, I charged it for three days
before putting it in, could it be &quot;over charged&quot;.

What do I test ?  This is a fairly new alternator (4
months before tranny died ; so I don't really want to
have to replace it, what I can't figure out is why the
EGR light is on too !

Thanks from a list lurker, who never would have been
able to pull a motor, tranny and perform replacement
without this great list...
