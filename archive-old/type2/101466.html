&gt; We are going to put a used 2.0l out of a 1978 into our 72 but the engine
came
&gt; without the fI, my question is, we have a set of dellorto 36s or
&gt; proggressive weber carb, which should we run this engine with. thanks
Dylan

Dude, Do the Dell's !
Unless you want it to start in upstate NY winter.
Then use the Weber, it has a choke.
Unless you want it to run correctly as designed.
Then I don't know, ( maybe the original fool injection :)
