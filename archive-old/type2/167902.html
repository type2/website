Subject: bloody mice!!

Hi, has anyone ever had trouble  with mice in their van?  They're 
getting into mine and I can't find any openings.  They're chewing up the 
upholstery and even  the seals around the engine.  I drive it everyday  
so I don't know what they do, or where they go, during the day. I put a 
bunch of poison in there tonight.Maybe they'll chew on that instead of 
the bed!
Bernie,
Fort Langley, B.C.
