Hi Volks!

&gt; I recently purchased a 71' van which has [...] a brand

&gt; So I was wondering how hard it would be to put the
&gt; 1600 engine in place of my 1700 in my 72' camper.

You'll need the rear engine mount for the '72-'79
Euro models with the 1600 engine, and the matching
engine tin.  You'll also need to find a way to
mount the air cleaner, because the original mount
isn't there in Type 4 engined buses.  Probably you
could cut that one out of the '71.  Not sure about
the rear engine mount, but I think it's different
in '72-'79 from the one used until '71.  The engine
tin definitely is different.

If you have or can obtain the parts needed, it 
should be no problem.

They came from the Volkswagenwerk like that.  :-)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
