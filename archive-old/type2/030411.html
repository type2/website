Joe, (and all)

Thanks to much effort by John Anderson and Sean Bartnik (in alphabetic
order, they have both helped *a lot*), I am very close to having a running
1980 California-spec Vanagon Deluxe Westfalia with BA-6 heater and Mark
Stephens Stage II rebuilt 2.2L engine(the proverbial full-kit) on the
road preparatory to my cross-US trip (in less than a month!!!).

As part of this, since it is a modified engine (terrified?  YOU BET!), I
have installed all the sensors I can, including the oil pressure/idiot
light sender Joe is talking about.  What I did was take a Dremel moto-tool
(OK, the Sears generic knock-off [manufactured by Dremel]) and grind the
hole in the tin 3/16&quot; larger.  After you do that, the sender will fit in
(barely) and will sit under the distributor.  This does leave a 1/8&quot; gap
between the sender and tin, but I regard it as minor. Because I am going
for the totally perfect engine, I intend to install a piece-of-inner-tube
gasket to cover that gap, but considering that very few of us have the
seal for the oil pressure sender (did you *know* that there is a rubber
boot that is suppose to seal that hole in the tin to the switch???), I
figure even if I don't get to it, I am better off than I was (no seal and
a 3/4&quot; wide gap).  In marking prior to grinding...
 o block the tin so that it is parallel to the ground/engine bloc as
   installed;
 o hold a permanent marker at as close to 90 degrees as you can, using
   your finger as a guide;
 o run it around the circumference of the hole. Because the hole is not
cut thru the flat of the tin, the width of the grind is not constant!!!!!  
I could demonstrate this in a second, but have thought of no way to write
it in an e-mail :-( You need to get someone to demo the technique.  It is
the obverse of drawing a ellipse with a compass by placing the piece of
paper over a tube.  Draw a circle, so that it looks like a circle when you
look down on it!  If the pen is verticle and the radius stays constant,
then you will be fine.
