&lt;&lt; Wow!  Yep, mcmaster-carr has it!


They have some serious hoses in there including some that

can handle up to 500 degrees farenheit!


Unfortunately, most of the really nice stuff comes in 3&quot; and up

sizes.  Might be ok for the run from front to back though.

Just curious, has anyone come up with a really good replacement
for the &quot;Y&quot; that joins the heat exchanger tubes to the central
tube...? This seems (!) to be a weak point in the system and al-
most always rusted and held together by whatever's left of the
factory &quot;insulation&quot; on many/most of the vans I've seen.
