&gt; 2.  The front right bolt holding the engine and trans together (the top one

&gt; 17mm bolt, it seems the 18mm box-end fits much better on it, but still wont

&gt; the meantime...

This bolt can only be removed after you reach around &amp; undo the nut on
the engine side of the tranny. The &quot;d&quot; bolt is designed so that
hopefully it will stay in place for you to put the darn nut back on
upon reinstall. 

&gt; 3.  I also read in the archives something about taking the trans and engine 
&gt; together being easier - it sounds much more complicated to me.  Is this 
&gt; indeed easier?

Me &amp; Troy Wicals meant to test this theory one weekend when we were
both pulling our engines in my driveway one Memorial Day weekend.
Basically I was gonna pull both &amp; we were gonna time it. I got lazy &amp;
never found out :( but You can do it either way. both have pros/cons.
