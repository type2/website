Subject: Carb Jetting.

Hello All,
	I wrote last week about how excited I was to be finally driving my bus.  As
you can guess, that initial excitement soon wore off in the face of other
problems.  Although, i know I am getting closer and closer each time I work
on 'Nanook'.
	So, we had it running, but it was putting and backfiring at idle on the
right side, so it was on to the PDSIT 34 balancing routine.  Although it
wasn't really routine, as I have not the Bentley manual (I'm still hoping to
find a first edition with the color wiring diagrams).
	Well, after following several different methods of balancing (Haynes,
Chiltons ugh, and Muir), we thought we had solved the problem.  Timimg was
right, points and valves were right, and the idle purred like a contented
tiger.  I was happy when I hopped in to take it on its supposed first
completely healthy run.  THings were fine as I pulled around the barn and to
the street.  Then, as soon as I tried to put power to it, my bus turned into
a sick rhino with a temper!  It had no power, was jerking all over the
place, and just refused to run smoothly.  This was bad, as the bus doesn't
live in a neighborhood, but on the side of a 55 MPH highway.  Needless to
say, I had some tense moments as hurried travelers raced past my crippled
bus.
	Now, we are trying to find out what we did wrong.  The interesting thing
is, before we ballanced the carbs, we had it running smoothly, with lots of
power.  It would just putt and backfire at idle.  What am I doing wrong?
	After I posted my happy earlier story, someone wrote me asking me which
jets were installed in my carbeurators.  See, this is a 2.0 Litre engine
that now has PDSIT carbs installed on it.  I have decided that that is a
good question.  What size jets SHOULD be installed in those carbeurators?
	I know that on this list, there are great, wonderful, and helpful people
just dying to help me out, and I sure could use a healthy dose of their
wisdom right about now.

Thanks a LOT!
