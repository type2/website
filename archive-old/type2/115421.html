Subject: Re: [T2] 80 MPH Type 2

&quot;However, in my Scirocco i speed and accelerate like a bat out of
hell. It's the closest thing to a sportscar VW ever created. I
cruise the interstates at 85 plus, that's what it's for.&quot;

I take it you've never driven a VR6 Corrado... :^P

MBC: I am still working on converting my '70 to a waterpumper.  VR6 or bust!
