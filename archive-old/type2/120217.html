Subject: FS- Same keyed ignition switch, door handles, hatch lock for
  sale

Hey Y'all,
I have some stuff to offer for sale before I put it on
that auction site. Most notably, I have an ignition
switch (all parts), 2 front door handles (exterior &amp;
interior), and rear hatch lock that are all keyed the
same AND I HAVE 2 VW KEYS THAT WORK ALL THESE THINGS. 
The parts come from a 79 passenger bus but should work
for 74 &amp; up.  $50 gets you everything INCLUDING
SHIPPING.  Or I will trade for a good rear 67 bus apron.

=====
Peace, John Baker

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
