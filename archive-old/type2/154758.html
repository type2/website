Subject: Re: [T2] Foldable Spare

From: &quot;George Lyle&quot; &lt;glyle_at_pon.type2_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Some Japanese pickups had a nifty device...

My 1995 Chevy Astro has one of those.  I never thought to look how the 
mechanism was attached to the van.  The next time I have the spare off I'll 
take a look.
