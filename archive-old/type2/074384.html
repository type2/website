&gt; fire wall to the pump. (the leak is at the connection
&gt; between the tube and the hose.)
&gt; 
&gt; Can I replace the flexible line from underneath
&gt; without removing sheet metal, etc.?

sure
&gt; 
&gt; I don't have to pull the engine for this? (For the
&gt; love of god, say NO!)

ok, no.


one thing I would do is put a shut off valve in the line, makes it easier
to do some jobs later on, like changing fuel filters
