Subject: Re: [T2] re-establishing EGR in my FI

[...]

okay, i understand. the lock nut i am able to buy, but the rubber boot -
no? my FLAPS feller told me there was no rubber of any kind on the other
side; that it was tapered metal and that was enough. we couldn't find an
exploded view of the valve. no improvising on the rubber, huh.

also: yikes i had sent my heads to rimco, and had to return one head
because they hadn't tapped the temp sensor II. now i am fitting the gasket
and intake manifold on that side and see that the outter studs they put in
for me are off. can't even put the gasket on. can i bang them back center,
how - with what, or should i wait, be patient, and send them back again?
what is the risk of cracking the head, even if i'm gentle with it?

&gt;I have the linkage.
&gt;However, if that washer is loose, then you lost the lock nut. And more than
&gt;likely the rubber boot on the other end is history too. That valve is a paper
&gt;weight. It is now history.
&gt;When it is working correctly, the valve only lets exhaust flow thru it in the
&gt;middle of its travel. It is closed at each end of its stops.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; now i am ready to pile on the fuel injection onto the engine along with
&gt;&gt; clean EGR parts. however i have two questions as i go along: regarding the
&gt;&gt; EGR valve, when i found it encased with trapped carbon, i found what
&gt;&gt; appears to be something like a thick counter-sunk washer on the end of a
&gt;&gt; threaded item. not sure what it does or how it works, and i wonder since it
&gt;&gt; fits in loosly do i simply lay it on the threads and button it up...? any
&gt;&gt; explanation on how this works and correct installation is much appreciated.
&gt;&gt; second, i am missing the linkage fron the EGR to the throttle valve. i
&gt;&gt; suppose once the connector pipe was plugged with silicone the linkage was
&gt;&gt; tossed. does a listee have a spare.   - steve
