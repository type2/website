I doubt the route is going to go this far north, but I'm in if it does.

Another thought:  If the baton were running through MY neighborhood, you
couldn't stop me from joining the parade if you tied the bus to a tree.  I
think a bus escort/caravan, loose and informal, would be great, filling in
and falling away as people have time.
