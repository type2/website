Hi,
In my humble opinion, most rebuilt heads arrive ready to bolt to either side.
On the right, you don't need the sensor hole.  On the carburated engines with
Air Injection Reactor systems (Smog pump) Original heads were drilled with one
A.I.R. passage on the left head and two on the right.  Most aftermarket heads
are drilled for two passages.  VW sold long fat screw in plugs to block off
unused passages.  This made it possible to use either head on either side.  For
FI engines, if the right head is not drilled and tapped for the sensor, one
could simply drill and tap the hole for the sensors threads.  One could drill
the left head for a helicoil or timesert, but I prefer to stay with original
sensor to aluminum contact.

Keep smiling,

Mike

&gt; If you screwed a temp sensor in the 1-2 head, you have an engine with 2 left
&gt; heads! A correct 1-2 head does not have a 10 x 1.0 sensor hole. Both holes
&gt; are for tin screws....6 x 1.0.
