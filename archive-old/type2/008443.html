&gt; A guy I've been communicating with is selling a bus with a VIN
number: 2212271111. If memory serves me, this is '71--his title and
dash VINs match; I told him to check the one in the engine
compartment, but he hasn't gotten back to me on that. 
&gt; 
&gt; HOWEVER!!!, the picture doesn't even remotely resemble a '71. MANY
too many differences. See what you think:

&gt; 
&gt; I'm guessing '77 because of the high seats and the sink vent on the
driver's side. Ideas appreciated.

This is no '71, looks like someone sold a VIN plate and title and put
them on this bus. Posibly stolen at one time, but may have been &quot;other
circumstances&quot;. I have a VIN plate and title from a bus I parted and
then cut up, he may have made one out of two or something.
