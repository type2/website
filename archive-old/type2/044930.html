Subject: [T2] re: steering box recommendation

Thanks to everyone for the steering box info, especially Dockter Tim for the
lead on Averre's.  They have a used one reputed to be in very good condition
that we're going to put in.  Certainly fits my budget better than the 750.00
new one from wolfgang or the 270 - 395 rebuilds I was able to get from
several different sources, and I don't have to worry about the core charge.

I'll let you know how it turns out!
