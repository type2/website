John,
I was looking in the archives recently myself on this subject.

There were a number of posts regarding FI / CDI. They were refering to using
the CDI module from:

Universal Corportation
730 Independent Avenue
Grand Junction, CO 81505
(970) 242-5267
(Tiger 581 CDI module - 84.95 - shipping included if payment by check)
(This is the module that Bob Hoover used)

None of the posts had the specific circuit mod needed for FI triggering, but
a couple of posts stated that the 581 module came with instructions for such
a circuit and that it consisted of a Capacitor/Resistor combination.

I just ordered a Tiger 581 for my '77 and when I get it I'll relay any
information that comes with it.
