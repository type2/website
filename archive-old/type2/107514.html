Subject: rear seal removal and installation

So how do you remove the reseal and then replace it?  Where does the flywheel
O ring go?  I need some help here.    78 westy....

Looked around at the local discount import flaps and found a round disk that
is a rear seal installer?  what is that? and do I need it?

Thanks!
