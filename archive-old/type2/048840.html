Subject: [T2] oil pump sealant

Well things are going way too well. First I find not only the elusive 
bus/trlr combo, but also the 5pack with ugly camper.
    To make things worse, the bottom end on the engine I'm doing for a friend 
went together like 'butter'. I'm waiting for the other shoe to fall!
    Now having left my copy of wilson back home in BC and it having been 
awhile since my last bottom end, my question for the senior members is do you 
or do you not use any sealant on the oil pump body when putting it back in 
the case.
thanks all
