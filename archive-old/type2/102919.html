Subject: Dizzy Identification please Plus its stuck!

I sent a message last night that did not seem to get
through, so here goes again. I have a 1967 type3 1600
dual carb engine (engine code &quot;TO&quot;) in a 72 bus.
Please help me ID this dizzy, the numbers on it are: 
0 231 129 019 then JFR4. It is fully centrifigal, no
vac cans.  According to Oldvolkshome_dot_com this is for a
split window beetle?? Plus, The distributor is stuck!
All clamps are loosened but the dizzy won't budge. I
need to get it out to put in points and condensor (and
put on the correct dizzy if need be) I spent about an
hour and a half last night pulling, twisting, prying
and cussing at this thing and IT WILL NOT COME OUT!
Anyone know any good tricks for getting out a stuck
distributor??
