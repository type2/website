Subject: Re: [T2] A cc'ing the heads question

I ended up using rubbing alcohol colored with a few drops of food coloring.
Cheap ($.79 for a big bottle), safe, and worked like a charm, completely
eliminating my &quot;sticky&quot; bubbles problem.

I might mention that before cc'ing the heads I bought three carriage bolts,
7 inches long and 3/8th's inch in diameter, and six nuts.  Using the 3 bolts
and the outside rocker arm stud of the head that wasn't being measured as
the 4 &quot;legs&quot; touching the top of my workbench the head was completely stable
and could easily be manipulated (by screwing the bolts clockwise or
counter-clockwise) to get the air bubble directed at exactly the right spot.
This made for very repeatable measurements.

&gt; &gt;I like using the colored water because it's safe and easy to dispose of,
but
&gt; &gt;I'm thinking perhaps I should use a solvent of some sort - kerosene,
paint
&gt; &gt;thinner, etc. - if it will help eliminate my bubble problem.
&gt;
&gt; Marvel Mystery oil (thinner fluid)?
