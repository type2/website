Richard,
In the initial tune-up, did they do a valve adjust? If so, did they use new 
valve cover gaskets, and was the left one properly installed? The oil in the 
heat exchanger is likely associated with a valve cover leak big time, given 
the length of time you had operated it, and would thus explain why you then 
ran low on oil. Check the initial repair order to see what was done and 
whether the parts list included valve cover gaskets. Even then, the gasket 
might have been out of its flange when installed. The other possiblity is an 
overfilled crankcase; were you charged for more than 4 qts of oil? The 
refill amount is 3.7 with a new filter, in any case. Does BC have the 
equivalent of &quot;small claims court&quot; or a provincial &quot;bureau of auto repair&quot; 
at which to file a claim for damage to your engine? Good luck!
