&gt; here's a crazy idea... (only people with a sense of humor should read

&gt;
&gt; drill 10 holes in the dash and install 10 salvaged ignitions and wires
&gt; going to behind the kick panel, tied down so they feel like they go
&gt; somewhere... with only one of them leading to real wires. that should
&gt; confuse em!

&gt; i know, shut up and go back to your hole, chris...

I saw a similar approach to opening a garage door.  A fellow bought six
identical-looking switches, some normally-open, some normally closed.  He
mounted them all in a box and wired them all in series.  You had to push
all the normally-open switches to close the circuit and open the door, but
if you pushed one of the normally-closed switches at the same time the
circuit would be opened and the door wouldn't work.  With three of each
switch, there were quite a few combinations to try!

Most pro thieves don't bother with the ignition.  They just drive
up with a flat bed tow truck and load up.  Awful hard to fight that, short
of chaining the bus to something.
