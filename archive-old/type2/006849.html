&gt; Any word on your installation? I am interested in how much
&gt; grief I could have  saved by spending some $.

Well here's the story.  I had it installed at the friendly, not-so-local RV place on
Wednesday.  This is a 77 Westy for those of you who also have a loaf to install this
thing into.

They mounted it under the seat on the passenger side with the fresh air
intake/output pointing into the front (FIF) passenger side corner of the cabinet.
The fresh air output hose goes to the plastic thingy mounted beside the cabinet door
right on the bottom.  They didn't hook a hose to the fresh air input and just
installed the other plastic thingy on the drivers side of the cabinet beside the
110V socket (to make sure sufficient air would get into the cabinet).  They ran the
propane from the tank (I guess they didn't want to fiddle around in the stove/sink
cabinet) and up through the bottom of the seat cabinet.

The only thing I don't like about the way they did it was that they didn't run the
exhaust output right to the side of the vehicle and they didn't put the mushroom cap
on it.  So I think I'll do this myself the next dry day we get (should be sometime
in May).  I also had them mount a 12V CO detector right beside the 110V socket.

On the weekend I bought some 3/8&quot; plywood and built a little box to cover over the
heater (same kinda deal that covers the inverter on the drivers side of the cabinet)
so that I could still store stuff in there without worrying about damaging the hoses
or propane pipes.  I put a large vent on the top of the cabinet and drilled many
3/8&quot; holes in the sides.

Last night we drove up to Whistler and camped in the parking lot (they have one lot
where they actually allow you to do this).  The heater worked great although it was
on pretty much constantly.  We even left it on all day while we were snowboarding so
the water tank and porta-potti wouldn't freeze.
