The correct curtain rods are made out of alumininum, and are about 1/16&quot;
thick,x 1/8th wide, and are attatched by two tiny sheet metal screws on
each end.

The sliding door rod follows the contour of the inner track from behnd
the passenger seat to the post behind the door.
They are flimsey, so don't let your passenger's swing on them when
entering or riding in the rear of your Westy---

Later,

Terry

Hi All, 
So I'm making curtains for the '72 Westy, but I can't figure out the
sliding door curtain. What was the original setup? Where was the curtain
rod and how/where was it attached? And... 
Does anyone out there have some good pics of their sliding door
curtains? I'm not a purist, so they don't have to be original VW design,
I just want to get an idea of what others are doing. 
Thanks,
-PM
