Subject: Re: [T2] lightened flywheels for hill country

Blane Bourgeois sends:

&gt; say if a person with a type I- powered bus lived in a very hilly area like
&gt; the ozarks or cascades and did most of their driving there...wouldn't it be
&gt; a benefit to use a 12.5# flywheel with a counterweighted crank?  i realize
&gt; the stock flywheel would be better for long flat hauls....where i live,
&gt; there is like five 30 degree hills every mile....

I'd leave the flywheel the way it is and go for ratio rockers, 90.5mm
pistons, better carburetion and exhaust. Maybe a 76mm stroke for more
torque.
