Subject: No Title

I had this same problem. I had a 1980 Vanagon carcass. No one would touch it
without a title. No way... no how! I finally had to tow it to a night time
parking lot and let the city police deal with it. I'm sure they towed it to
a scrap yard somewhere. 

&gt;I'm not sure where you live but there are generally people who will come
&gt;and haul away scrap cars for free. Look in the phone book. I have gotten
&gt;rid of a few wrecked cars this way even busses without suspensions.
