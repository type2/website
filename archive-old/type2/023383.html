The only problem with the filter pumps from Beetlemex is that they are for
dished cams only, you can also get them from Small Car Specialtys (aka
Autobarne), they import those in directly from the factory, just remember
they are for DISHED cams only.

ps, I have had a CB one on my bus for 14,000 miles without a problem or
leak.

Well,

Many people like the filter pumps, but think the quality of the
aftermarket units stinks... (myself included) The CB one is decent, but I
don't like dealing with CB, and would rather have an original volkswagen
part.

I ran across this link at btlmex for the real deal volkswagen item...

Dunno how BTLmex is to deal with, kinda bugs me they dont have a telephone
number other than a fax, but regardless at least there is now a source for
quality filter pumps again.

take care,

Steve

P.S. i know, i know, the filter sticks into the hot air, but I figure if
VW does it on the beetles from the factory it cant be that big of a deal.
