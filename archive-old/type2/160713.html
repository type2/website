Subject: tip

Here's a tip for those who like myself are brain-cell-impaired from previous nefarious activity:

After nearly losing my $30 locking gas cap, I found something that works for me.   My old cap had little handles that I could use to hang the cap on the grill beside the gas inlet.  The locking one doesn't have those and a couple of times I've driven off with it laying on top of the pump.  Since then, I've started doing this:

When you unlock the cap, leave the keys in it and set it on top of the pump.  (Or put it in your pocket in a high-crime area and you have to go inside to pay.)  Now, unless you carry two sets of keys with you, you can't leave without replacing the cap.  Haven't had that problem ever since.  

Probably should have saved this for Friday but that would depend on my brain cells working properly that day.  THought it might save somebody $30.  Sorry, Ron.  Cheers...KR
