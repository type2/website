&gt; $5,500 a year??? You've got to be shitting us!!! Does that include free

$5,500 CDN a year......maybe $4,000 USA dollars....still high but they
have much higher minimum coverage standards if I'm not mistaken

&gt; unlimited towing, a bumber-to-bumper mechanical warranty, and all the 91
&gt; Octange gas you can burn? It had better...!

mine is over $3,000 USA with no tickets, married, over 25 (way over) and
no claims in many years....but live in a major metro area...have higher
than minimum coverage, assigned value, full coverage....(and wifes's
S*turn, with similar coverage except assigned value)


good coverage is $$$$
