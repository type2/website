No, the gas will simply accumulate upstream of the intake valve, as
the valve won't let it go anywhere until it opens.  Injection systems
of this type don't depend upon precise timing, as the fuel isn't
delivered to the cylinder, but to the intake manifold.  The mixture is
determined by the time that the injector is open, so it doesn't matter
if the valve is opened once, twice, or more times as long as the
&quot;open&quot; time adds up to the amount that determines the proper fuel
quantity.

OTOH, diesel injectors must be much more precise as they control not
only fuel quantity but also ignition timing.  The cylinder inhales air
only, and the fuel is only injected when burning is to commence, near
TDC on the compression stroke.  This is the reason that diesel
injectors and pumps are so terribly expensive.
