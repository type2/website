  sliding window on my 78

I've always gotton good seals from Bus Depot, just recently when putting a
new window in my sliding door and the &quot;new&quot; seal I got from somewhere else
was absolutely refusing to go I ordered one from BD &quot;Stat&quot; and got it the
next day and after the appropriate German profanities were offered it went
right in.


for Christmas my wife got from Bus Depot for me a set of the big elephant
ear black rearview mirrors for my 78 bus.  they were immediately put on
the next clear day and look really sharp on the bus.. but my wife asked me
to pass on one small complaint, you packed the box with newspaper coupons
but they were all out of date,  in the future could you please use current
coupons to pack your shipments (my wife is the ultimate coupon clipper)


in any case, those mirrors were on my wish list for a long time but I
never seemed to have the extra money when placing an order for more
critical components. glad she got em and who ever took the order for
helping my wife get it right (even if you used old coupons) They are
really nice looking and while I don't see any better to the rear, I look
more often now.

thanks again
Bob
