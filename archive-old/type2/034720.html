&gt;I have a question regarding the 091 transaxles.  Is it possible to install
&gt;the ring and pinion gearset out of a 1600 bus into this transaxle.  I
&gt;currently have a heavily modified Bus running an Alloy 270cid (4.4lt) V8
&gt;with a custom 091 transaxle.  Currently I run 29&quot; rear tires but am lifting
&gt;the Bus both front and rear and will run 33&quot;x12.5&quot;x15&quot; tires on the rear
&gt;with custom wheels and obviously cut guards, the 29&quot; tires will go on the
&gt;front after a 6&quot; lift.  What this means is I need to lower the gear ratios
&gt;in my tranny and I thought the 1600 ring and pinion would be the best
&gt;option, that's if it fits to my chromemolly carrier.  Or is the another ring
&gt;and pinion that has a lower ratio such as from a 1700 bus (mines from a
&gt;2.0lt) that fits straight in.

There is a 5.43 (38/7) ring and pinion that will give you the ratios you
want.  It is not available in the States but was used in Europe in the 1.6l
busses with 091 trans (assume 76 and up).

I was told by my never-again tranny rebuilder (Bug Stop in Arlington, TX)
that the ring and pinion sets are not interchangeable between the 002 and
091, and based on that I don't think the set from the 1700 bus will work,
but I'd get a second opinion.
