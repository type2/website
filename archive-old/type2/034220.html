&gt; For reference, my typical summer environment is 80-100 degrees F, and
&gt; typical winter environment is 30-50 degrees F.  I usually average about
&gt; 16mpg in the same driving conditions in the summer.

First off, 30-50F is *not* winter. -25 to - 35F... *that's* winter :)

I've had only a nominal change in gas consumption (20mpg in summer v.
18.5mpg now that winter is here), but I've been using my gas heater non-stop
since about the middle of November... I chalked it up to that.

&gt; Maybe it's something to do with the gas they sell in the winter?  I'm
&gt; getting tired of getting only 200 miles per $20 tank.

We put all kinds of gas line antifreezes and god knows what else here in
Canada in the winter. I've noticed no *significant* difference.
