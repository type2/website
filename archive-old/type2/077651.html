Subject: Re: Westy Tent Parts

&gt; Does anyone have, or know where I can get the two front door / flap
&gt; poles for a Westy Tent?

Which version of the tent?  If it's the driveaway/add-a-room, you're
basically looking for two c. 5-6' poles with a pin on top to slip through
the grommets.  I don't know of any new/repro source for these poles, but
it would be easy enough to rig something up from thin conduit or pipe.
