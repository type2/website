Subject: brakes make bus turn...

Listees...

Today I put in my rebuilt brake booster(servo). My brakes are 1000% better, 
if anyone is running brakes without the vacuum assist of the brake booster, 
I highly recommend repairin this; I feel so much safer driving my bus now. 
(if you can feel safe in a bus, har har har)

However, this is not a new problem, but when i brake the bus turns to the 
left. The faster i'm going, the harder I brake, the more it turns. I have 
been told that this is a faulty brake hose.

Which hose is it?

Can someone please explain this to me? How do the brake hoses work? They are 
not filled with brake fluid correct?  Why does it make the bus turn? What do 
I have to do to fix this problem.

Thanks in advance to whomever can shed some light on this,

Daniel
