Subject: muffler installation prolem

Howdy all,

I've found that many tears, knuckles, hours, and
countless obscenities can be spared if the heater
boxes are loosened on their front bolts, the muffler
mounted loosely, the two mated together, and then all
nuts tightened down in sequence, i.e. a little on this
one, a little on the next, etc.  I tried it with the
heater boxes tight for hours over many days, with no
success and much lost skin.  I ultimately loosened the
boxes, and got the two well connected in 20min.  Of
course, if helps if the engine's out.
