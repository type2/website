&gt;About 11.5-12V until the engine is brought up to 3000RPM the first time - then
&gt;13.3-13.5V.

My old mechanical regulator showed close to those voltages and I never had a problem with my starting battery staying charged, but I did have problems getting my aux batteries to charge.

I'm not sure what &quot;newer batteries&quot; was referring to, but if you use a standard flooded lead-acid battery to start your bus, 13.3-13.5 is on the low end of acceptability for charging.  By that I mean that it is acceptable***, but just barely.  Of course, you should measure the voltage at the battery to rule out the possibility that wiring is affecting the readings.

I put in a Wells solid-state regulator and immediately saw a 0.5-1.0V increase in voltage from my charging system, up to low 14's.  Not too long after that, my alternator died.  Coincidence?  Who knows.  The rebuilt Bosch alternator I installed has been fine ever since, but I do think the higher voltage resulted in a higher load on the alternator which caused it to run a little hotter than before.  On the plus side, my aux batteries now charge nicely.  I am careful to avoid taxing the alternator heavily on hot days, just in case.  My starting battery, as before, works fine.

*** Before any &quot;engineers&quot; flame me for this, let me include the fact that I have gone many years and many tens of thousands of miles under these conditions, without any battery trouble.
