Subject: Re:  [T2] Re: Vanagon engine into (79) Bay

But he has 79 tin, shroud and alternator mount doesn't he?


&gt;The tin is different, the shroud is different, the way the alternator
&gt;connects is different, the oil breather is different, way more of a pain in
&gt;the ass then it would be worth.
&gt;
&gt;I have a air cooled 73, and a 81, I have both engines in the garage (the 73
&gt;motor is from a 77) and I will tell you it is significantly different but
&gt;similar.  I am sure it could be done, but I would take an easier route.

Very minor case differences that shouldn't matter and the  79 
(071)heads are the same which is the big difference.  Swap out the 
heater boxes, tin, shroud,  alt mount, and which ever way you are 
going with the dip stick.  Drill out the 79 engine mounts to 12mm and 
it should fit just fine.


I just went the other direction.  Put a 78 case into a 83 Vanagon. 
Only difference is the engine carrier inserts in the case need to be 
enlarged to 12 mm and I needed to drill a hole for the dip stick.  No 
sweat!  I'm going to build a spare long block this way also so I can 
use it on my 77 also (with vanagon heater boxes)
