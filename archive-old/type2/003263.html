Subject: price reduced on 69 bus in S. Calif
Date: Mon, 25 Jun 2001 12:16:10 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I've lowered the price on my 69 bus to $1800.00 OBO.  It's a 7 passenger
with middle seat, 1600 single port, firewall mounted spin on oil filter,
body is in good condition and so is the paint, interior is complete but in
fair - poor condition.  I also have another 69 bus here for parts and if you
buy the running bus you can remove any parts you can have any parts you
might need from the parts bus.  Email me directly for more information and
photos.  The bus is in Hesperia CA.  If you are interested come take a look,
I need to sell it by the first of the month if possible because I'm getting
ready to move.

John
