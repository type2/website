Subject: Jerome trip - personal stats

Just got back from Jerome yesterday.  Great trip.  Great place to be.
Lots of really nice people.  Spectacular scenery.  More buses than I've
seen in the last 5 years combined!  Anyway, for anyone interested,
here's the stats from my bus and the drive:

Bus:  73 Westy
Engine:  1.8 p&amp;c with 1.7 heads (don't ask), 009 dist, 
      Pertronix, dual Weber IDF 40's, 50k miles on rebuild
Transmission:  stock, old, and getting noisier each day :-(
Tires:  Michelin 195/70/14

Total miles for trip:  2800
Avg mileage (mpg):  18.0
Oil consumed:  1.25 quarts
Altitudes driven:  1000 - 9500 ft. elevation (never knew there 
      were so many mountains in AZ!)

Typical highway speed:  67 mph / 3900 rpms
Bad-Ass hill climbing:   3rd gear, 50 mph / 4000 rpms
Top speed:    88 mph (yes, that's actual!) while running away from an 
     angry gravel truck (ever see the movie 'Duel' with Dennis Weaver?)

Mechanical problems:  
      1:  Odometer quit - fixed with superglue - 1 hr.
      2:  Spark plug wire came off - stuck the bastard back on.
