Just a quick question, anyone know where I could find a fuel gauge that will
properly fit in the instrument panel.  I don't think the one that bus depot
sells is the one I want.  I need the one that sits next to the speedometer
on the left above the warning lights, etc.  I think I cooked mine by
accidentally trying to fix the power connections while at a stop light. Any
help would be great.  Thanks
Dave
