Pete:

For an engine to run it needs 3 things:

1) Spark, at the proper time.
2) Fuel, in the correct amount
3) Sufficient compression

So, the first thing you need to determine is, which one of the 3 are
you lacking.

Randomly swapping out parts in the hopes that you hit on the problem
can be very time consuming (unless you just get lucky early on) and
*very* expensive (if you're buying new parts to swap with.)

If you were just driving along and all of a sudden it just died, and
you *didn't* hear any expensive (i.e., mechanical,
metal-meeting-metal) sounds, then it's probably an ignition or fuel
problem, though it wouldn't hurt to run a quick compression test
first.  Look at your points (I assume you have them, not electronic
ignition) and see that they're properly gapped and that the timing is
at least roughly correct.  Inspect for loose or cracked wires, hoses
that might have come off or have cracks in them, check that the Temp
II sensor is tight in the head, etc., etc.

If nothing obvious turns up here (and your compression's OK) then pull
a spark plug wire, hold it (with pliers) next to a metal portion of
the engine, and have somebody try to start it up.  No spark?  Then
you've got a fuel problem that you need to diagnose.  Good spark?
Then you've got a fuel problem to diagnose.

You might need to learn more about your ignition system or fuel system
then you know right now, but both systems are fairly simple (a lot
simpler than you might suppose) and not that hard to trouble shoot if
you have the knowledge and a few simple tools.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;     Haven't been following this list much in the past few months due
to
&gt; illness and being in the hospital. latest was over Christmas. Will
&gt; probably be back in next week but during this break from doctors I
got a
&gt; chance to drive my bus (75 9 passenger) and that felt good. However
my
&gt; joy was short lived :(  After about 30 miles and heading home it
just
&gt; died. Got it towed and checked out what I could ... thought it might
be
&gt; the coil (original) so swapped that and the wire. Still no go ...it
&gt; turns over .. I can smell gas and hear the click click when I push
on
&gt; the accelerator (ignitors?) but won't start :(  Any ideas on what I
&gt; should be checking?  It's a 1800 FI with auto.  Any suggestions
&gt; appreciated ... have lots of time but very little money :))
&gt;
&gt; Pete
&gt; 75 VW Bus ... sadly sitting.
