&gt;&gt; Has anyone heard of a mod. to the engine where an extra spark plug is
added to
&gt;&gt; each cylinder? I remember reading about this &quot;twin plugging&quot; of motorcycle
&gt;&gt; engines especially big twins such as BMW's and Moto Guzzi's years ago. The
&gt;&gt; benefits are supposedly increased efficiency in burning the gases with
&gt;&gt; improved power coupled with increased M.P.G.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Any thoughts?
&gt;
&gt;Nitro-burning drag racing cars in the US use this kind of setup. It tends to
&gt;shorten engine life quite a bit. Or is it the 50 gallons per mile fuel
&gt;economy you get out of one of those cars that's responsible?
&gt;
&gt;The reason they use dual plugs in those engines is to get the nearly-
&gt;unignitable nitromethane (you can throw a lit match into nitromethane and
&gt;watch the match fizzle out) they burn in those cars to light. On a VW engine
&gt;I'd just put an MSD ignition box on there and be done with it.
&gt;
===========================================================================
Another thought:

There used to be an experimental aircraft shop (Great Plains AC??) that
used to offer dual ignition heads for the Type 1 and maybe the type 2 heads.
The dual ignition (mag or CDI) is highly desirable when you can't pull
over the check things out very easily.  If my (increasingly dim) memory
serves me, there were reported efficiency, power and &quot;smoothness&quot; increases
with no reduction in service intervals or general longevity.

Good luck,
