Subject: Re: [T2] Jerky fuel injection

&gt;|&gt;My 2 litre accelerates in a tolerable but annoying &quot;jerky&quot; manner, but 
&gt;only for the first 5 or 10 minutes after starting from cold, or near cold.
&gt;
&gt;I would check the resistance values of the air and head temp sensors, as 
&gt;either of these being out of wack might result in this behavior.

This procedure doesn't seem to be in the Haynes manual.

Any chance someone can list the test points and specified resistance ranges 
for each of the two sensors. I have a digital meter.

Thanks for your reply.

BTW I have a steel tow bar and bull bar here in Northern NSW free for the 
taking.
