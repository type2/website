Subject: Kendall motor oil

Joel Walker wrote that his oil temp. dropped when he started using 
Kendall oil, I was dubious, but I am totally convinced now. It's GREEN, 
which prompted me to call up the FLAPS and ask &quot;This stuff is 
SUPPOSED to be green, right?!&quot;, but even if it's green, it DOES reduce 
oil temperature a SURPRISING amount!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
