Subject: Re: [T2] Re:  Replacement 205/70/14s

Beware Cooper is going through a lawsuit for tire failures. You might be 
eligible for replacement tires.

A simple web search will return info on this stuff.

&gt; &gt;&gt;No one seems to make a 205/70/14 with a load

&gt;
&gt;195's are only 1/2 cm narrower!  I run D rated
&gt;195 Cooper's (actually Mastercraft RD's).  You'll
&gt;thank yourself for having proper load rated tires
&gt;instead of some swishy passenger tire with
&gt;insufficient load rating.  I'm a cheapskate and I
&gt;resisted this.  But the difference between the
&gt;superior handling of a vanagon or bus with load
&gt;rated tires (even cheap ones) versus
&gt;non-reinforced passenger tires (even expensive
&gt;ones) is dramatic.
