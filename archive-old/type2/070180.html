Subject: what kind of gear oil in a Splitty tranny?

I am gonna replace the gear oil in my tranny and have been told that it is
good to drain out the old tranny oil and replace it w/ a semi-synthetic
that will quiet things down a bit and minimize wear on the tranny.

Any thoughts/advice/experience welcome.


BTW one thing learned on my recent 1,000 KM + road trip w/ the bus,
earplugs really help quiet things down a lot simplier than trying to
soundproof that tin can of a bus! :)
