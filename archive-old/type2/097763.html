Subject: clutch cable?

Hi, this morning I had trouble with my 72 bus.  I started the engine in 1st 
gear, and it jumped forward and stalled.  I then started in neutral and when 
I shifted into reverse, it jumped and stalled again.  The clutch pedal feels 
spongy and has less resistance than 2 days ago when everything worked fine.  
Does this sound like a clutch cable or something worse?  How do I know if the 
cable is bad?  I know that replacing a cable is supposed to be fairly easy 
and I think that I am ready to try it.  Can someone tell me the steps, or is 
this in the archives?  
Thanks in advance, Rob
72 Bus
