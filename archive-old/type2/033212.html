&gt;Hey Volks, My bus keeps backfiring. It seems like it

...which is pretty much the definition of not running great. Backfiring is
baaaaaad...baaaaad, I tell you!

If you have either a big exhaust leak or a big intake leak, either can
cause backfiring, I believe. I'm no expert on this one, but I'm certain
about intake doing it. An intake leak (extra air getting sucked into your
intake manifold not through the carb) will also burn valves if left to its
own devices. It happens when the rubber intake boots don't seal well,
develop cracks or otherwise...or through the seal between the heads and the
intake manifold--or lack thereof.

An exhaust leak can cause damage mainly through the backfiring
itself...otherwise, it's relatively benign this time of year. In the
summer, an exhaust leak will cause your bus to run hotter...unless you live
down under and then winter is summer and summer is winter and everything I
said only applies on Tuesday if you're wearing bus underwear and sporting a
list t-shirt.

This is what I have learned and some of it may be wrong...but list people
love to catch me being wrong (which I am good at), so I'm copying the list
for sanity check's sake.

Have fun! Joe
