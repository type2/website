I need to replace a broken wiper shaft on my 67 and can't angle it
enough behind the speedo to get it in.  So it appears the second easiest
way would be to remove the speedo pod.  How does it come off?

no, you don't remove the speedo pod.   Have you dropped the parcel tray?   if
you drop it on the passenger side the wiper assembly can be wiggled out from
up there.  If you have a stereo in the dash it would be in the way and should
be removed.

I dont know how deep you went in disassembly before you started, but you
should have the parcel shelf out (4 bolts) and can then get in to remove the
speedo cable from the back of the speedo.  The end will not fit through the
parcel shelf, so if you really NEED it all the way out, you will have to
remove the speedo cable from the left front wheel hub.  It is a press fit and
if you cant seem to pull it out, just remove the hubcap and push on the end
that is exposed in a square hole in the center of the hub cover while someone
pulls it from the other side.  You can remove the speedo from the pod and
should be able to get the shaft in to position.  I do not believe that the pod
itself can be removed.

neither do you have to remove the speedometer, and even if you did, I would
not recommend complete removal of the cable.  Disconnecting it from the speedo
should allow ( with removal of the screw holding the dash tray to the nose
frame, and the bolts holding the steering coloumn to the pod bracket) the tray
to drop to the floor.   The drivers side kick panel should be removed first,
if there is one.  You can then leave the tray on the floor of the cab while
you work under the dash.   But I generally just drop the tray on the passenger
side to get to the wiper stuff.    You do need to carefully wiggle it past the
wire up there.   For a complete dash rewire I would drop the tray, though.  It
is easier to get back there with it out of the way.
