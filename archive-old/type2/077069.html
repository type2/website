Subject: Re: [T2] temp sensor thread size

Dear John &amp; Bill

An M10 x 1.0mm bottom tap should be readily available through good tool 
suplliers, but it might cost more than a few pounds or dollars.

M10 x 1.0mm, is the standard thread size for metric brake pipe fittings, 
some domestic electrical fittings, the oil-pressure switch tapping on 
VW-Audis, VW 2000 Type 2 valve rocker screws, etc.

Regards.

        Nigel A. Skeet

&gt; &gt;Evening,
&gt; &gt;I  have another question I hope someone can answer. I have a 78 Westy
&gt; &gt;with a stock 2.0 and the threads for the temp
&gt; &gt;sensor on the head are buggered up. I can't get the sensor to sit flat.
&gt; &gt;What size is it so I can get a
&gt; &gt;tap and clean up the threads.
&gt;
&gt;M10 x 1.0, extra fine 10mm, sort of hard to find but a good Ace hardware
&gt;and I mean good or machine supply place should have it.  In a pinch you
&gt;can &quot;make&quot; a tap to chase the threads or even cut new out of an old worn
&gt;out T4 valve adjusting screw.  Just grind/file 2 or 3 cutting edges into 
&gt;the
&gt;screw and grind the end to a bit of a taper.  I used one of these for some
&gt;time till I finally broke down and bought one.
