Subject: Air dam/spoiler for camper.

Hi Volks,
           There's a company here in the UK that sells a chin-spoiler style air-dam for baywindow (and vanagon: they have three models) busses. It's about 4&quot; (110mm) deep and is advertised as improving stability by cutting down airflow under the bus.

 Anyone have any experience with these? Do they work? Are they more effective on a lowered bus?

 Any contributions welcome.

Cheers,
        W.
