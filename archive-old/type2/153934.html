Sorry about that George. I'm on several different lists and I know that a 
few allow that sort of thing, but most do not. I won't let it happen again.

&gt; As a matter of fact, it's pretty well known that promoting auctions is
&gt; not something welcomed on the list.  This is clearly stated in the charter
&gt; and gets discussed again every time someone decides to ignore the charter
&gt; &quot;just this once&quot; to promote their auction.  Since you seemed to think that
&gt; your action might not be proper, you should have checked before posting.
