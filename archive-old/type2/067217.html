Subject: a second west in front of my home...

Hi everybody,

There is a second west in front of my home.

My young brother (21), after trying my van, decide to buy him a westy 
too. It's a westfalia (with pop-top) '76, coming from colorado.

You can see it at http://www.microtec_dot_ca/~plp/west.html.

Bye
