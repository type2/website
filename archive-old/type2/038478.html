Subject: my AVP heads

listees,
well, i just installed my second AVP head onto lizzy
so she now has a matching pair.   Everything seems to
be going well(knock on wood) my only problem i have
had was that on each head the rocker arm studs were
not tightened down all the way so they kept coming
loose until they are lock tighted.   other than that i
give a thumbs up so far.   on another note could
someone send me the link to the indivuals web site
with the bus names.   and as a final note if there are
any computer literate types out there i could use some
pmail help.   im trying to put the type 2 webring
banner on the bottom of my page (geocities website)
and cant figure out how to do it.  if you could assist
drop me a line.
