Subject: Re: buying parts on net

&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions about buying parts f/people through
&gt; www.type2_dot_com ads?


&gt;     Just have them sent COD.

No, I disagree.  I could send you a box of bricks and tell you it was
gold, and you would have to pay the COD before you opened it.  In a more
realistic scenario, I could say the part was in good condition, and when
you opened it (after paying the COD) you might not agree.  Now a lot has
been spent on the shipping and someone has to pay it.  Best thing I know
is to talk to the person on the phone and then to decide to trust them or
not.  There is nothing else you can do.  I sent COD once and the jerk
refused to pay when it arrived, so it came back to me, and I ended up
losing about $40 on the shipping and also sold at a lower price then I had
gotten people to agree on before.  just my $0.02.
