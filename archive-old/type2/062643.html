Subject: Re: 78 Brakes: ATE? Girling?

I successfully changed the brake pads. Not too hard if you do it the right
way.:)

Thanks to Joel Walker, John Pertalion, and Jeff Carver for their advice.

Here's what I learned:
1. The problem I was having with the pins was that I was trying to hammer
them out from the wrong end (I was referring to Muir, who says to pound
toward the center). The pins are slightly tapered, so they had to be
pounded from the smaller end (d'uh). Also, the pins in the Girling brake
appear to be able to be installed only from one side. Once I was pounding
from the right end... It always amazes me how easy it is to do certain
things when I'm doing them the right way. :)

2. When I took off the wheel again after going to the FLAPS, there was the
big &quot;G,&quot; right there on the caliper. I guess the ATE calipers are marked as
clearly.

Thanks, all, as usual,
