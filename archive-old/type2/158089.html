Subject: RE: [T2] CHT gauge testing

I tried switching the leads, but got nothing. I just hooked it up to a
variable power supply and although it did not go below 1 volt, it did not move
the meter at all. I tried several different voltages and nothing. I would have
thought that 1 volt would have at least pegged the meter, but it never moved.
So I guess it is the gauge and not the sender or maybe both....

Corbett

If the gauge does absolutely nothing, try reversing the sender terminals on
the gauge.
