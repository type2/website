Hello everyone.  I am in the middle of adjusting my valves after replacing
the push rod tube seals   and I am following the bentley guide but it
doesn't tell which cylindar is what number.  Can someone please tell me
what cylinder is which?  Please uses references like closest to front of
car and closest to back of car.  Thanks
