&gt;Has anyone around here done their ball joints lately? I'm in the process and 
&gt;have a coupla questions:
&gt;

I did mine recently (1971 Westy) and I wrote up what I did and posted it on my 
site at:

        http://coyote.accessnv_dot_com/wayback/b_joint.html


&gt;1) Where did you get your ball joints, are they German, how much?
&gt;

I bought mine from Wolfgang already loaded in the control arms -- then 
returned 
the old ones.

&gt;2) Did you replace the torsion arm bushings and bearings? If so, where the 
&gt;flying heck did you find the parts? I've read Bob Hoover's sermon on this, 
&gt;and he says to use Whitney's urethane bushings. Fine, but my catalog doesn't 
&gt;list them for a bus. Nor can I find the stock parts anywhere.
&gt;

Bob's Sermon is for _bugs_ not busses. 

&gt;2a) If you didn't replace the torsion arm bushings, how does one tell how 
&gt;good/bad they are? What are the consequences of leaving the old ones in if I 
&gt;just can't find the part anywhere?
&gt;

Just cleaned up a re-greased 'em.

&gt;3) What did you use to pop the lower ball joint off? What do you use to pop 
&gt;the tie-rod off with?
&gt;

Torsion bar pressure -- 

&gt;OK, more than a couple questions, but I gotta know...
&gt;
