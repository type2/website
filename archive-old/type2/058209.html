Subject: engine dies in reverse

Changed the points and condensor, set the timing, went out for a spin.
Ended up at a nearby lake, played with my son for a while, went to back
it out of its parking space and it DIED when I put it in reverse.

My 4 year old son was saying &quot;we're never going to get home&quot; while I
slid under the bus and yanked one of the wires going to the reverse
light switch. Started it up, put it in reverse, backed out, drove home.

Weird error. Why would a short circuit cause the bus to die? With its
nice new points and condensor?
