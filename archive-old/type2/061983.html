Subject: Bumper Stickers and flapper doohickeys

Sorry if this thread has been played out (I'm three days behind in reading
my e-mail), but I heard about a t-shirt slogan that may make a good bumper
sticker:

        Role Hemp '96

On second thought, putting such a sticker on a VW Bus might not be such a
good idea, considering the search and seizure thread from last week :).

VW content: I want to hook up my carburetor pre-heat hose. I have the
standard air cleaner for a '66. Do I need anything besides that flapper
doohickey that sits at the air cleaner intake, the hose itself, and the
engine tin seal for the hose? Also, is a beetle flapper doohickey
interchangeable with a bus one?
Thanks in advance,
