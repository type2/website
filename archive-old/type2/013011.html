Just out of curiosity I went out to take a look at my CV's to see if they
were bolted tight.

Here's what I found.

On the 83 Aircooled Westfalia. The bolts are ALLEN head cap screws.

On the 82 Aircooled Vanagon the bolts are 12 Point scocket head screws.

Aparrently on the 83 the allen cap screws have been installed to replace
the OEM 12 point socket head screws.

The fact that your allen won't work or get enough grip may be because you
have the original 12 Point socket head screws.

Unless the sockets are clean they just look like rounded out Allen Head
screws.

If I mis-directed you, I am certainly sorry. I just hadn't ever seen the
12 point scoket screws before since my 83 has aparrently been modified
with the Allen type.
