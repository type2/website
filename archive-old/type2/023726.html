Hi,
     (from memory- havn't had to do this for a while...)
 
      You need to push the new cables through their tubes from the front of
the bus to the back. If I remember this correctly
you take off the underfloor pan from below the cab to get at the area where
the cables run between the cab 
and the chassis tubes. Clean up the ends at the heater flaps (probably just
cut the cables) and then pull them though the
 tubes from the front to take them out. Then disconnect them from the
control levers and drop them out through the floor
into this same area. That gets the old ones out (keep track of the circlips
on the levers, they are easy to lose).
 To get the new ones in you push them through the cab floor first, then hook
them up to the levers. then get back under
the bus and push them through the tubes (trying to avoid kinking them). When
they appear (pray!) out of the tube ends 
you can proceed to try and connect them to the control flaps again. There
should be a flexible boot thing to keep gunk
off the cable end once it's in place. You'll probably have to replace the
flap to cable fittings as they rust up pretty
quickly and then fall apart when you try to dismantle them. Again, the
easiest way to get the old ones off is to cut
them (big wirecutters will chop through the thin parts of the fitting and
let it drop away from the flap lever.
 
 The dashboard bits are fiddly (especially in poor light.. :-(   ) and the
underbus bits are the usual pain in the arse,
with bits of flaking rust falling in your face as you work.
 
Cheers,
            W.
