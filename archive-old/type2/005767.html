Walt this is a classic case of what has happened to me on two earlier
Westies. The starter is overheated by the engine after a good long run and
just won't operate. I used to get lucky and sometimes it would work after
cooling down to normal and a good whack with a hammer. Unfortunately the fix
I went through was to buy a new(rebuilt) starter and fashion a heatshield to
protect it from the engine heat. This seemed to cure the problem.
HTH,
Courtney

&gt; Hello Listers:
&gt;
&gt; I've checked the Type 2 archives, and I kinda know what to do next but
some
&gt; hand-holding and reassurance from the list would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; My wife and I took the '76 Campmobile camping at Ocean Shores, WA this
&gt; weekend and all was well until the trip home.  The bus started just fine
&gt; after packing up at our campsite.  We stopped for gasoline about 60 miles
&gt; into the return trip and, after fill-up, when I turned the key all we got
&gt; was a &quot;click&quot; from the starter.  A couple of dirt bikers gave us shove
away
&gt; from the pumps and we bump started the engine.
&gt;
&gt; When we got home I checked the Bentley manual and performed the &quot;lights
on&quot;
&gt; test.  The headlights go out when the starter switch is engaged.  I
cleaned
&gt; the battery terminals (even put in a new battery) and still no go.  The
&gt; lights still go out when the switch is engaged.  Where do I go from here?
&gt; Perform the jumper wire test?  Whack the stater with a hammer?  Could it
be
&gt; that the wires at the starter might be corroded?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any and all suggestions.
&gt;
&gt; Best regards,
&gt; Walt Fogle
&gt; '76 Campmobile
&gt; Woodinville, WA
