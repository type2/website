Marcus,

This is interesting, your compression test numbers are very high. They are
all fairly close together, which tells me your engine does not have a major
problem on any one cylinder, but there might be a problem with your
compression tester. If not, those numbers are puzzling. You would need to be
running very high CR to have compression values that high, and if your
numbers are accurate, I'd say you could have a problem right there.
