Hello Gang!

I started to take a closer look at my new '70 bus tonight. Nothing
mechanical yet, decided to do a little cleaning. Pulled out the rear
seat (no middle seat in it :-( ), decided to clean up the mess that was
under it - looked like a can of Fix-A-Flat exploded. I peeled it all
away, and found something interesting - two uncovered ducts where the
firewall meets the floor. The ducts were packed with this junk,
definitely blocking any air flow that was supposed to be happening - I
was able to get it all out however. 

It looks like there are supposed to be covers that form the top of these
ducts - any idea if these are available, and where to get them? 

How bad was it for these to be blocked? From what I could gather, fresh
air from the front of the bus was routed through these into the fan
shroud, right?

Anyway, I've got a ton of questions already, but I'll try to spread them
out (as well as seeing how many I can answer myself from the
archives...).

Thanks for all the help so far!
