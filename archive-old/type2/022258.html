Please don't take my word on the wraps. Please look into it before you 
discount this solution. I know what I know --- well I'm not sure where I 
got that info --- my head is full of all sorts of useless stuff.

&gt;leave well enough alone. The HC reduction must be fairly small as I've
&gt;been able to pass CA smog all along. And if wrapping the pipe would
&gt;stimulate its demise, that should be avoided quite clearly. The idea of
&gt;fabricating an over-pipe and spot welding it on is one to try if the HC
&gt;isn't within limits of the local smog authorities.
&gt;In the meantime, when in the bone yard, buy ahead!
