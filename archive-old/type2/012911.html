Well I bit the bullet $84.00 for the ATE clutch master, two quarts DOT 4
Castrol LMA at $ 4.95, $3.20 for 1.5 fee brake hose and lucky me I
already had two clanps. Holding one Quart of the Castrol Dot 4 in
reserve, didn't need it.

Flushed out the whole system with the Dot 4 Castrol.

Boy was it a mess under the steering wheel. I think I'll get the lemmon
scented brake fluid next time.

It's really going to be exciting along about November when we have our
first freeze to see if this cylinder starts to drip.

Well with my newly repaired engine, my fab clutch, all of the instruments
illuminated again, I'm ready to install my Bosch Driving lights through a
relay and dash switch I took off of the old 82 before she left.

Thanks for all the input.

I'm still trying to figure why these ATE and FAG cylinders are going bad.

The push pin from the clutch lever has about 3/8&quot; of free play up and
down in the cylinder reciever so the piston can't be bottoming out in the
cylinder.

Oh well another mystery unsolved but resolved. Just got to pour a couple
of quarts of rubbing alcohol on my carpets and hose them down and install
them after drying.

Thanks 
Stan Wilder
