Subject: Rear Hatch

...
Locking the rear hatch will not prevent in from being opened from the
inside.  All locking does, is rotate a lever on the push-button mechanism
that presses the latch, the same latch that the inside opener operates.  I
don't know of anyway, other that a slide bolt or clasp or something along
those lines, that will keep the hatch from opening with the inside opener
installed.

Lets keep the kids (and drunks) safe.

&gt;&gt;If you take a piece of wire and thread it thru a hole in the latch 
&gt; &gt;&gt;arm, then drill a hole in your new panel and feed the wire thru 
&gt; &gt;&gt;the hole in the panel, you have a way of escaping the van for 
&gt; &gt;&gt;whatever reason 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Just please be aware that if you carry small children (or drunks) in the
&gt; &gt;back of the bus that one little tug on that wire is all it takes to open
&gt; &gt;the rear door.  So either make it hard to get to (like tape it down with
&gt; &gt;duct tape) or else lock the rear hatch.
