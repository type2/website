Hi Alen 

I don't know where you live but I have two
foam pieces that are cut to the exact same size
as the top and bottom beds. I'm not having any 
trouble with my campers beds. These foam pieces
are about 4 inches thick and one side has the 
shape of an egg tray. They came from one of the
westfalias I've got that a fairly big guy whom 
also had back pains had. I don't want them. Not sure
on shipping but if you or whoever does want them thats
what the cost will be to have them.
