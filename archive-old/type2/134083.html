Subject: Re: [T2] Tire shop apes broke my bus (long)

One issue with tires seems to be that most tire shops think VW 
Transporters like modern MiniVans use passenger car tires. When one 
says load range C or D that should immediately tell the vendor the 
tire type the buyer is after - light truck. Tires in 14&quot; rim with 
high load ratings are uncommon in modern vehicles. Uncommon does not 
unpopular :) Indeed. 14&quot; high load rating tires are quite popular 
with VW bus drivers! If the look is blank or confused one should 
either educate the seller of walk away and find someone who knows 
tires and not just how to run a cash register.

I had similar issues getting spec high load rating tires for our 
Jetta wagon in the correct size. Everyplace I went insisted that 89 
would be just fine. I did not buy tires from those shops. I found a 
shop that understood what I wanted and why and sold the tires at a 
fair market price.
