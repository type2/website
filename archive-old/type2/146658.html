Hmm. Finding this mighty confusing -  grey brown plugs suggest good 
news. As Haynes puts is &quot;Grey brown deposits. Plugs ideally suited to 
engine, and engine in good condition&quot;. Black dry plugs mean too rich 
fuel mixture, black wet means worn engine. Assuming your 1,3 and 4 plugs 
are black and wet, that suggests wear requiring a top end rebuild 
(piston rings at the very least). What is confusing is that cylinder 2 
seems OK. Can't think of a logical reason why, unless a PO has done a 
partial rebuild (maybe just replacing valves on number 2? - can't 
imagine why).

On the other hand if 1,3 and 4 are black and dry, your carburettor/FI 
needs attention. Perhaps the leak on number 2 was letting in air and 
making the mixture weaker, and actually bringing it to something about 
normal giving a normal looking plug.
