Subject: Re: [T2] VPC Air Conditioner for Station Wagon

Dave Bolen has posted to the list as recently as 5/5/2005 and can probably
answer any general questions you have about the history of VPC units, you
might have to look elsewhere for detailed info though... as far as I know
all the A/C units were after market designs for the US market and installed
here in the US either at the entry port or by dealers...

back in January I asked a couple of questions about how many different A/C
units there were and below are the answers Dave came back with.

---- My question
Anyone really know how many different AC solutions VW (and others) have
offered for the type 2 over the years?

When browsing I have seen 5 types of AC units in the pics and VW brochures.

1) Front Overhead AC unit. (Overhead just behind driver / passenger seats.)

2) Rear Overhead AC unit (Overhead behind the rear passengers, near the rear
hatch.)

3) Westy A/C Unit, A half-height woodgrain box mounted behind the driver
seat with a large black plastic duct coming up out of it, the duct is
mounted at drivers seatback location, pointing rearwards.

4) Same as 3 (Westy unit behind drivers seat) except this time the duct is
positioned on the drivers side wall with the duct pointing towards the
passenger side / slider door.

5) Underdash AC Unit.

Anyone know how common or rare these variations are and are 1 &amp; 2 part of
the same A/C package or completely separate options?

I think the overhead units date back to the early models with upright engine
and the underdash was for the later type 4 engine?

---- Daves answer
If I remember correctly, while at VPC, we made a *very* few &quot;executive&quot;
A/C units for VW of Mexico which employed both the front and rear units at
the same time.

It was along time ago in a land far away....&lt;grin&gt;

I still keep up with my buddy and old roomate who was the engineer on all
the VW bus A/C units...but his memory is fading somewhat as well.

I don't know if DPD made the same variations or not.

Underdash or overhead didn't make any difference on engine type, just
where could you mount the unit in the bus.  IIRC, most dealers prefered
the overhead as it didn't complicate being able to get at things under
the dash.

Cheers, dave

----My reply
Dave, some interesting info, going on memory do you recall if the rear mount
system was offered as a stand alone option, or was a rear unit just used in
combo with a front one?

Anyone know if there are currently any websites devoted to bus A/C or a good
A/C section on one of the sites with pictures and what not of what AC was/
is available for the type 2?

I hate to take on a project but I never see info about Type 2 A/C in any one
place, I just come across bits and pieces of info and pics here and there.
Perhaps I could start to get some basic archival info together about the AC
systems and some pictures, put it up on a website, ask other to contribute
pictures and info they have see where it goes... just a place to archive AC
info, VW, after market, whatever...

I don't own a bus at the moment let alone one with a AC system in it to
tinker with, so I wouldnt be much help as far as first hand knowledge goes.

---- Daves reply

Ok,

As much as I remember right now.  When I started working for VPC sometime
in 73 or 74 as a Master R&amp;D Tech,, they still had the &quot;secret&quot; front 3
feet of a bay window body sitting in the R&amp;D shop.  It was shipped to them
from Germany before 1968 so they could work on fitting a very nice
underdash unit to it in preparation for the new models.

So, right away, you know that the first models were going to get an
underdash unit.

They also had T4 engine on an engine stand where they developed the
compressor mount as far as they could.  I actually bought that engine
a year later when it was time to &quot;clean shop&quot;...first last and only engine
that I ever tore down that I was sorry that I did....it was perfect
inside.

I really don't remember much development going on for the bus setup while
I was there as it was all pretty much set by that point...the only one I
do remember is the VW Mexico &quot;executive&quot; unit(both front and rear).

My buddy did tell me several weeks ago when we talked at Christmas that
he pleaded with the director of engineering to switch to a rotary
compressor on the bus....since price point considerations were a
primary concern, it didn't happen, but!.. the outcome of which was that
the late VPC mounts should be readily adaptable to a rotary compressor
setup of some sort as he *was* allowed to re-develop them with both the
York and rotary compressor in mind(don't know exactly when though).

I do remember several times, pulling in a bus with A/C from a local dealer
in order to try and improve the cooling.  My buddy also had a bay window
bus, so he was well aware of the problems with hot air recirculation in
the engine compartment and so on.  The bottom line though was that
condense was about as big and efficient as we could get it....the major
problem being how to improve airflow inside the evaporator in the bus with
limited room and trying to keep some sort of esthetically good look.

I left there sometime around 76 to go back to school and get a graduate
degree, so anything later than that time would have been hearsay from my
friend.

So, to answer your questions below.  I don't remember the *top* rear mount
unit ever being offered by itself...too far from the driver to make people
comfortable. Unfortunately, I didn't help much with the bus A/C unit as I
was mostly doing aftermarket/factory stuff for the Porsche, Mercedes and
BMW folks.

I will add that the Porsche folks almost seemed to go out of their way
to make things hard to install(needing special tools and so on).  The
BMW's that I worked on back then were a dream to work on....nice
fasteners, you could take almost everything on those cars apart with
normal hand tools...and get it back together easily.  Fit and finish were
absolutely superb..._dot_compare that to a new Chevette....it got to the
point that I would not work on it because none of the sheet metal parts
were &quot;broke&quot; at the edges...all of them had *razor* sharp edges...you
absolutely could not put your hand in the engine compartment with cutting
yourself badly.

Don't know of any sites except Richards that have A/C info...I don't even
have an instruction sheet for the &quot;new&quot; unit I picked up last April.

One more note...

*ALL* air cooled A/C units were installed either by the dealer or more
than likely at the port of entry.  That's why most units were not shipped
with instructions(cost savings).  To my knowledge *no* air cooled units
were *ever* shipped to Germany.

Rabbit/Golf/Audi  units were a different matter.

Cheers, dave
