Subject: Wendelin update

&gt;Shoot, Nikki, sorry to hear it. Anybody on the good side of The Big Muddy
&gt;would do themselves a favor and get their engine from NW Con Rod in
&gt;Seattle. You don't get ANY of this type of junk from them. Pay Jerry his
&gt;price. Get a By God spec motor with German bearings and Mahle pistons with
&gt;quality machine work and rote, proven, procedures. No flaws. No pulled
&gt;studs, always new. This guy is not your typical Californicated used part
&gt;assembler. Tell him I sent you.

Wull, dang! I wish I'd known that a year ago! :-)

&gt;Sorry also to hear your mechanic had to try 3 sets of manifolds before
&gt;discovering the bad ports. Man alive, get that guy a hand glass.

Nah, we tried three sets of manifolds because AVP insisted it wasn't the
ports. I just happened to have the manifolds (my stock) so we tried 'em
all. Even had a set ground down. No go because the metal's compromised too
far down by the previous exhaust leak. The ports were resurfaced but they
were beyond help, according to my mechanic (who I have a lot of faith in).

So we'll just have to see how it goes.
