&gt; &gt;&gt; But at the moment my wife wants me to tow a pop-up railer behind the
bus
&gt; so we will have the room. I told her no-way, it will kill the poor Bus.
&lt;&lt;
&gt;

   Exactly when are you short on room, when camping or while on the road? I, too, have felt cramped in a Westy with it loaded down with all the necessary gear you have to haul on a trip. My '77 has a trailer hitch, and I have a small utility trailer I built from a kit I got from Harbor Freight, about $200.00. I built a wooden box on the frame for about another $50.00 and I now have a very light weight trailer ( I can easily pick it up from the back when it's hitched up, maybe weighs around 200 lbs.) for hauling chairs,grill,bikes, etc., without having to try to cram all that stuff in the Westy. I also have a Ch*vy conversion van w/350 V8 (no flames,please) and a 1986 Coleman pop up trailer which weighs about 1800lbs. The Chevy tows the Coleman with ease, but on mountain roads you can feel the load, and the engine temp. climbs. I have no doubt the '77 Westy could NOT pull this trailer up some of the mountains the Chevy has, it would simply be asking too much from such a small engine, IMHO.   Jeff S.
