&gt; 1) 79-83 bus cali fuel injection - the O2 sensor does not control mixture, 
&gt; it only helps with emissions. There is still a head temp sensor greatly 
&gt; contributing to the emissions.

Hmm, how do you suppose the O2 sensor helps with emissions if it does not
control the mixture?  It is not the only thing that influences the
mixture, but it influences it in a BIG way.  By comparing the amount of
oxygen in the exhaust with the amount of oxygen in the ambient air, it
sends feedback to the ECU on how it's doing with mixture regulation, and
the ECU then adjusts the mixture to compensate, thus keeping the mixture
very close to stoich all the time.  Closed loop, it's called.  The
computer will make the mixture richer or leaner based on the signal it
receives from the O2 sensor.


&gt; 2) By adding the Air/fuel ratio guage and inline potentiometer to the head 
&gt; temp sensor, you trick the computer into thinking the engine is cold and it 
&gt; sends more fuel or pulses the injector longer. There is no need to mess with 
&gt; fuel pressure because fuel pressure has nothing to do with rich or lean, 
&gt; just maintaining the pulse pressure in the injector.

This is not true either.  If the fuel pressure is higher, clearly for any
given amount of time the injectors are open, more fuel will flow through
them.  The only way the ECU can adjust the mixture is by adjusting
injector pulse time.  If fuel pressure is higher, then the mixture will be
richer than if the pressure is lower, as the higher pressure will force
more fuel through the injector in that amount of time.

&gt; 3) to flow more air, get rid of the air box and strap a k&amp;n air filter to 
&gt; your AFM.

If you don't mind sandblasting the inside of your engine ;-)
The reason the K&amp;N flows more air is because it is a much less restrictive
filter than stock, i.e. more crap winds up inside your engine.
