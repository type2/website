Subject: Grease under the nails...

This isn't about a VW, but I feel it needs to be said...

Several weeks ago, I &quot;moved&quot; the Spitfire down the road, to a happy new owner who 
realized he was getting a great deal. I knew it was a great deal, because it was the 
same deal I made on it 3 years ago... a Spit &amp; and spare, needing work but running, for 
$650. It never inspired me, for some reason. I need the room for my next project, that 
&quot;perfect&quot; restorable VW van. 2 weeks of scrubbing, sorting tools, and preparation, 
followed by 4 weeks of empty &quot;echo&quot; in the garage.

I drove north, to Portland OR, a couple times, in search of my new rig, but it hasn't 
appeared yet. Eugene has become a desert, when searching for interesting cars. The big 
cities, and the Deadheads, have stripped all the old vans from our streets, and about 
the only time you see a classic is when the Deads show up for a concert... like the 
recent &quot;Further Festival&quot; (BTW, Keasey lives just a few miles away... with the original 
Further rusting away peacefully).

It's been nearly 10 years since I rebuilt my Brat, and I haven't owned a vehicle that 
has needed work since. When Tina &quot;died&quot;, I purchased the Hyundai, and that's been that. 
Oh sure, there are oil changes, installing radios, guages, the Weber carb and the 
like... but no real demanding work. The only time the car's been in the shop is for 
&quot;recall&quot; work. Hey, when you have bad luck with shops, you should just realize it and 
stay away!

I had forgotten how unbelievably pleasant it is to actually work in the garage! Imagine, 
a clean floor, roof overhead, a nice sunny day, clean tools neatly at hand in the 
roll-away, everything at hand. No putting blocks under the wheels to keep it from 
rolling down the drive, or having to lay in the gravel and weeds.  Absolute heaven!

Somewhere in the car is an interesting &quot;clunk&quot;, when I travel rough roads. I think it is 
something moving laterally, but I haven't quite figured it out yet. It seems to come 
from the rear end, so I tore the brakes off the car tonight. With 85K on the car, it was 
about time to repack the bearings again, and check out the brakes. As suspected, they 
were 80% worn. It seems the wheel cylinders have &quot;stuck&quot; on one side, wearing one 
shoe unevenly. I was pleased to see the drums are evenly worn, no gravel has found its 
way inside. There is so little wear, I probably wouldn't have them turned, if it wasn't 
for a major oversight on the part of the manufacturer... there is no adjustment hole in 
the backing plate. Imagine, having to rely on automatic adjusters to keep everything 
nice and snug. The right wheel had developed the slightest trace of fluid, so it's time 
to replace the lot.  In a previous life, I would rebuild the cylinders... but they only 
cost $20, so it looks like I'll spring for the new parts.

The backing plates needed cleaning, so naturally, they were pulled with the rest of the 
parts. While these were off, the rear shocks were bare... hey, why not do a job right?

Ok... I have to admit, most of my cars that &quot;needed&quot; work were showing 100K+ on the 
speedo, but I was surprised at how new parts have been improved. Ok... you can't 
necessarily count American cars of the 70's thru mid 90's, but has anyone else noticed 
that parts seem to last longer?  Take shocks, for example. My old Brat was 15 years old, 
and the shocks were like new. This car, with 85K &amp; 7 years, and I can't tell them from 
new. Maybe I'm just not used to working on &quot;low mileage&quot; cars, but I'm impressed. I 
expect a good life from good aftermarket parts, but original? I always thought they were 
designed to wear out. 

Any way, tomorrow it's off to the parts store and to have the brake drums turned. True 
to form, I don't expect to be back before 11... an hour or two, and the old girl should 
be back together. Next I get to pull the front wheels. The brakes aren't worn out, but 
maybe I can find something else worth replacing. &lt;grin&gt;

BTW, I don't know if I should ask for help from this group... but is there any cure for 
an addiction to having grease under the nails?
