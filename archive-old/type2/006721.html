Subject: Re: cold weather considerations

I was in the service station yesterday and saw a magnetic oil sump heater.
Anyone have any experience with these?  Do you remove it each morning?  I
think the manufacturer was Kats, not sure.   Cost was $32 so I didn't want
to buy one on spec and hope it worked!
