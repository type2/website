&gt; They sell both new and remanufactured Type IV heads for reasonable
&gt; prices. Does anyone have any experience with them?

where do they get &quot;new&quot; type IV heads ????   no such animal at resonable
price, and like hen's teeth since they all??? recently come from South
Africa or Spain?????

&gt; I'd appreciate any feedback, positive, negative, or neutral.

get one from Bus Depot (AVP), Boston Bob, or one or two others I'm sure
you will hear about from here
