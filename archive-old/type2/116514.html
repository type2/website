Subject: Re: [T2] head temp gauge

I installed the VDO gauge/sender a couple of years ago in my 71 westy w/1600
DP.  I really don't care whether or not the absolute accuracy of the gauge
is correct.  All that matters to me is that it gives repeatable readings, so
that when it deviates from the observed normal reading I know something is
wrong.  It proved itself on a trip this past summer.  Within a short
distance the gauge went from reading normally to reading high and the
temperature was fluctuating way more than normal in response to engine load.
Turned out the spark plug under which the sender was mounted had come loose,
to the point that combustion gases were leaking out and impinging on the
sender, and the sender was flopping around on the plug instead of being
tightly held between the plug and the head.  Once I tightened the plug all
is well again.
