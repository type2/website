Subject: Re: Running Diesel thru Dual Carbs..?????

The theory is that the diesel cleans excess carbon from the cylinders.
The drops of Diesel get whacked around by the pistons and mechanically
remove the carbon.

If this is so, then water will do as good a job as Diesel, and will stink
a heck of a lot less.  

I have tried this on a japanese high-mile engine
that was pinging a lot on regular gas.  I got it good and warm and then
slowly poured a quart of water down the carb.  If you pour too fast you
will stop the engine.  If you will pour really fast you will
hydraulic-lock the engine and that will be that.

While this procedure did cure the pinging for a couple of months, I
wouldn't recommend it as regular maintainance.  It is a band-aid fix at
best.

If you do this with either Diesel or water, be sure to change the oil
right away as some of the Diesel or water will get by the rings and into
the oil.
