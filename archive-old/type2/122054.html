Thanks for the feedback! I pulled off the tire, did a little banging
with the rubber mallet and viola! Even got to work on time this morning.
Thanks to all who responded!

&gt; they tightened up my emergency cables.........
&gt; went to leave this morning for work the drivers side rear wheel would
&gt; not let me leave.

Hi,
Was it raining or where the roads wet the day you drove the bus
and parked?  If so I could be that the brake shoes locked up on the
drums. My bus does this too... I'm not sure if it's do to an incorrect
adjustment or something else...? But when ever its raining I always
leave the parking brake 'off' and leave the bus in gear.

To unlock the frozen wheel.. remove the locked up tire,, then tap
around the drum with a rubber mallet, should come loose. If not pump
the brake once or twice and tap again, has worked for me.
