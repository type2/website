&gt;
&gt; OK, now I have to ask:  How do you measure decibels???
&gt;
&gt; I thought a decibels were a measure of the loudness of sound, and that sound
&gt; would be twice as loud with every  X___X  number of decibels increased??

Not just for sound. Decibels for sound are dbSPL sound pressure level.
you can aldo measure dbv (volts) dbm (power) dbu (unreferenced) on and
on...
db is a logarithmic scale which makes it more convenient for measuring
certain things like audio.
