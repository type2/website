Subject: Re: [T2] child's cot

I had a couple of nylon netting gear hammocks left over from our old boat.
Got them at West Marine for a few dollars each.

I needed some more storage up front for stuff while we slept in the back of
our camper.

I made some hooks out of steel rod so the gear hammocks can be hung from the
Westy child's cot hooks, and I can hang 1 or 2 hammocks as needed.  This
arrangement works very well, and stores in a compact package when not in
use.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  The child's cot was missing when I bought my '74 and I looked around
until I found one.  Now that I have it, I always leave it at home.  It is a
PITA to install and you will end up scratching your paint.  &lt;&lt;
