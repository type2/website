While in Panama (mid 70s), my boss had a mexi-beetle. It had the old 
type engine and interior, but the dash seemed taller than I recall. I 
wonder if they combine Super and Standard beetle parts... or if the 
seats were just lower to allow for more headroom.

BTW, was the beetle wearing Mexican tags, or was someone able to get it 
past customs?
