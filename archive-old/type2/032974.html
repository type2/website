Subject: Re: Rocker assembly nut torque?

	Mick,
	Did you find wavy washers under the nuts??? 10.0 foot-lb is the
listed torque in the Haynes 914 manual that went to work with me and hasn't
gone home yet... it specifically lists washers as going with the nuts
that hold on the rockers, and calls them 'spring plates' in the 
exploded view illustration. I remember them being standard VW wavy washers,
which fits both 'washer' and 'spring plate' pretty well.

	Good luck!
	Bill
