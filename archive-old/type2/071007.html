I picked mine up several years ago and I don't know what I've done without it 
before. It's great when you take the kids camping.  Parents in the bus, kids 
in tent.  I don't worry about theft in the campgrounds I go to, people are 
pretty liberal about leaving things out and about.
Paid $450 for mine and have been offered upwards of a grand to sell it.  
Thought about it for a second and said no.  Too hard to come by.

Just my two cents,
