what does *not swayed by public opinion* have to do with this discussion??
please folks lets separate the facts.  all that is in question is calling
something *original* while it is no where near *original*.  who cares if you
like cal look or bone stock.  would you be thrilled to go look at a bus,
bug, or whatever if the ad said original and it was not??

&gt; I give three cheers to Eric for having an open mind to all things that
&gt; interest him and the fact that he isn't swayed by public opinion and makes
&gt; his own choices.  Diversity is very cool....expands horizions...opens up a
&gt; wealth of opportunities more narrow minded folks won't see.
&gt; Not putting down Wades opinion for sure....just adding my own!

&gt; &gt; just curious Eric.....how can you stand to go from:
&gt; &gt; &quot;an *original* unrestored westy in very good condition&quot;
&gt; &gt; &quot;71 pan (for the irs), ghia disk brakes, set of Porsche alloys, full
velour
&gt; &gt; interior, filled dash with custom vdo gauge set&quot; ?
&gt; &gt; Besides the fact that its free or cheap, It seems like a very big change
&gt; &gt; that I wouldn't even wish on my worst enemy, even if he wasn't a vintage
&gt; &gt; nazi :)
