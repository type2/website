Subject: Bus wouldn't move

Jumped in my bus yesterday, cranked her up and went to back up.  She
wouldn't budge.  Tried forward gears as well.  No luck.  Checked to make
sure no one had blocked my wheels.  All clear.  So I cranked her back
up, ran through all the gears no problem.  (clutch is only 3k old and I
had driver her the previous day).  So, I just revved her up and dropped
the clutch.  A brief metal on metal sound and I was in motion.  I'm
pretty certain that it wasn't the clutch/pressure plate combination.  It
felt as if my wheels were locked.  Has anyone experienced this problem.
Do I have a potentially larger problem.  Any and all suggestions
accepted and gladly considered.
