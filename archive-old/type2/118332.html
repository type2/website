Subject: bumper guard!

Hello,
I am in the final stages of getting my '68 bus refurbished and I am
desperately looking for a single bumper guard for the front bumper of my bus
before the whole gets painted.
I am now realizing that having bought that bumper with a single guard-
although in very good shape and at a fair price- was not a good idea...
 Any idea where I can find one? I phoned all the junkyards in the Orange
County area and none it...I am willing to get both guards if one has them.
Thanks very much for your help.
