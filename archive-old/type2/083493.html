Subject: Re: [T2] Subject: Modern Brake Switch

I just drive my speed. Its legal. If someone has a problem, its their
problem for the few seconds it takes for them to go by.
I drove the interstates ~1800 mi on the trip to EB at 55-60. I may have
passed 1 or 2 people, everyone else passed me. I dont care.
I drive I95 every day and Miami is as busy as most places.
I mostly stay on the left and like the tortoise I get there eventually.
Chant with me people...
I WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED!

&gt; &gt;When I get a tailgaiter who refuses to pass me I simply slow down to
&gt; &gt;somewhere around 15 mph below speed limit. This really frustrates them a=
nd
&gt; &gt;they then figure out some creative way to pass me. Sometimes it is even =
by
&gt; &gt;moving left and =A0into the passing lane...
&gt; -------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt; Sadly, I must reply that this approach is no longer very effective out he=
re in the Greater Seattle/Puget Sound area.  It might even get you shot...
&gt; Around here, driving in the curb lane of a city arterial at _ONLY_ 5 MPH =
over the posted limit will get you deluged with &quot;negative feedback&quot;.
&gt; Comments in casual conversation along the lines of &quot;...and the SOB refuse=
d to drive more than [5, 10, any number will do] MPH over the limit, and he=
/she made me late for...&quot; are common in gatherings at any level of society,=
 polite or otherwise.
&gt; It's my experience that VW buses may receive a slightly higher level of t=
olerance in this regard from drivers of sedans, etc.  But drivers of SUVs, =
especially those newly transitioned from mini-vans, seem to operate in a co=
nstant state of irritation at other drivers/vehicles including VW buses.
