Subject: Re: [T2] Bay Window Westy interior into a split window?

From: &lt;VWTGS_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

 Hey John was that 3-4 inches shorter or longer.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The bay is narrower and longer.

If you put a 74/75 full width Westy bed in a 66 bus, you will have 1&quot; extra gap on each end. If you try to put
the 74/75 Westy mattress in the back, it hangs over the back end at least 3&quot; to 4&quot;.

To use a bay side wall cabinet in a split, you need to shorten it.
