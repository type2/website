Subject: north phoenix vw garage sale

for those of you in the north or east side of the valley in phoenix, 
i am having a garage sale and unloading all my  miscellaneous vw 
parts... mostly bay window, some early bug/bus, a few vanagon items. 
a near-complete 36 hp motor, disassembled.   i wouldn't run up from 
casa grande for it, but if you are in the area, its goin' cheap. 
saturday,  corner of 109th st and cholla st, 7am to noon.
