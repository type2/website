Clark,

remove the steering knuckles from the torsion arms - or at least take off the upper torsion arms.
Stick both upper torsion arms on the springs, push them in until they hit the beam extension that holds the rubber stop. Once both arms are half way in place you can start working them over the beam extension using a big hammer and a good sized pry bar.
Secure with hex bolts and counter nut.
Now stick on both lower arms (easy) and secure with hex bolt and nut.
Use a jack to lift steering knuckles and lower arm to mount the knuckles to the upper arms.
Reconnect steering, shocks, stabilizer bar, and brakes.
Get an alignment.
Done.

Even if your balljoints look OK, once you have the assembly apart take the torsion arms and ball joints to a VW place and have them press in new balljoints. You will not regret it. 
I took my arms and new balljoints first to a garage around the corner and they couldn't even get the old ball joints out with their regular shop press. My VW shop (Peek Performance in Lanham, just outside DC) charged $20 per ball joint. Ball joints are petty cheap at Busdepot.
Also, once all the tie rods are disconnected, get new tierod ends (really cheap at Busdepot) and replace the steering pin bushings (get the repair kit). And while you are at it, make sure you are not driving around with a OS (original stock) '75 steering coupler - it's $25 and really tightens up steering.

Subject: HELP! Torsion arms back in?

List,

i pulled the torsion bars out of the passenger side of my bus.  I was going to
switch the entire assemblies with the ones from my parts bus, but a closer
inspection revealed that mine are in better shape than my spares -so i need to
get them back in.

i have not removed the steering knuckle from the arms - do i have to?  I have
tried to reinstall the arms, but it seems they won't (or i can't get them to)
line up with the bushing up in the beam.

What do i have to do?  The bus is on jack stands all the way around - the
front ones are on the front beam.

please help,
clark in ky
