&gt; Subject: 12 point bolts &amp; heater boxes

&gt; Also, my heater boxes are thrashed, so I want some suggestions.  The
&gt; cheapest I have found them is for roughly $200 a piece, but I am not
&gt; really in a position to buy them right now.  If someone knows a cheaper
&gt; place to find them, that would be great, but I was wondering what
&gt; people's opinions were on replacing the boxes with extractors/headers,
&gt; and use a gas heater instead.  I will need heat for the bus, because I
&gt; live in Kansas and I do want to camp in the thing.

--&gt; John, if you find a source for an extractor/header system for the Type
4 engine (which I assume you have in your '74), I'd sure love to hear
about it.  My exhaust system is in sad shape -- lots of rotted-out flanges
-- and the only aftermarket systems I've seen only go from the heater
boxes back.  I have a gas heater and don't really need the boxes...they're
rusted out anyway. 

Also, if you camp in places that have electrical hookups, I highly
recommend buying a 1200 watt or so electric heater.  It's cheap and safe
and will keep a pop-top Westy toasty on chilly nights, though it'd
probably be too weak for serious winter camping.  Just make sure you don't
exceed the current rating of the Westy's wiring...I can't remember if mine
has a 10 or 15 amp circuit breaker, but that would be good for a 1200 watt
heater in the first case or up to 1800 watts in the second.
