X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

After solving the carb problems I decided new plugs were in order as 
well as an oil change. I had put 20-50w in after I rebuilt the carb 
and the motor was leaking quite a bit more than usual. The motor was 
also putting out a blue cloud when I started it up in the morning 
which for whatever reason coincided with the switch to 20-50w. When 
the plugs came out the ones form the right side head were brown and 
ones from the left side were grayish black. New Bosch plugs went in 
and a fresh batch of Castrol 30w.

AFAIK the motor has been in the bus since 1979 when Judy bought it. 
It has pushed the bus around for over 70,000 miles on it and who know 
what it had before since it came out of an early 70s b**tle.

Work on the bus went well and I even tightened up the new muffler and 
cured the slight exhaust leak. Tools went back in the bus, washed up 
and went for the customary victory lap. About a mile down the road I 
took a sharp left turn onto a side street and a HUGE blue cloud was 
left in my wake. UUUGGGHHHH. The smoke seemed to stop. A mile later I 
took and hard left into the neighborhood and again a another lengthy 
trail of blue smoke-this one worse! The blue cloud is intermittent 
and did not occur at idle. Oil light never came on.

Aside from the obvious burning of oil the motor sounded great and had 
good power. I coasted into the driveway as the motor was shut of just 
in case. I checked the motor and found nothing. Fired it back up and 
did a few runs through the neighborhood. The blue smoke appeared 
under load up a hill and around corners. Otherwise runs good. Motor 
is not overheating.

Another visual inspection. This time the tail pipe caught my eye. 
There is oil in the tailpipe and it seems to be a fair amount. I 
stuffed a rag in it and it came out black with oil. I checked the oil 
level and it was at the high mark on the dipstick. I may have put an 
extra cup in when  I filled it up.

A compression check is in order but I do not have a gauge handy. I am 
guessing a ring has gone bad. John suggested a cracked or holed 
piston. Any happy ideas? Is there any chance this is the result of 
putting a little too much oil in and hitting turns  hard or going up 
hills is sloshing oil around in the muffler?

UUUGGGHHHH!!!!!!
This has been a real Charlie Brown week :)
