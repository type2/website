Subject: RE: [T2] Differences from vw pancake to Porsche 914 pancake

Oooooohhh... Aaaaahhhh... I didn't realize you could use a powerglide with the
Corvair engine... Now I know what I'll do when my engine gives up the ghost
(probably not for another 50K-100K miles, knock on wood).

A big advantage to going to the Corvair engine for me is that my Father's
first new car was a Corvair. And since he helps me with major stuff like
engine rebuilds, keeping him happy is important!

&gt; If you've gone as far as looking at going watercooled, you may want to look
&gt; at installing a aircooled 2.7 liter flat 6 and transmission from the Chevy
&gt; Corvair. I have this setup in my bus and I'm very happy. The Chevy flat six
&gt; is what VW should have done in the progression of their engines. It easily

Considering that the flat-six was used in the 911, you are dead-on there. A
much more spendy option, in fact, is to put the Porsche flat-six in the bus.
Of course, a solid 911 engine will set you back $3K-$5K minimum.
