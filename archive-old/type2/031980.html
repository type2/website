&gt; *I am EGR-less, blocked off at throttle.
&gt; Is the Bentley spec. still the correct reading?

Should be.  The CO is adjusted at idle, when the EGR should be closed 
anyway, so having it permanently blocked off shouldn't make any difference.

&gt; *How much should i expect to pay someone to &quot;check/adjust&quot; mixture?

I would guess in the $40 range.

&gt; *When calling is there anything in particular that I should ask about?
&gt; or just ask if he can &quot;check my FI fuel mixture and adjust if necessary?&quot;
&gt; There is a local shop that has been in business for 25+ yrs and use to
&gt; work on VW's. Now he specializes in porsche only. I am hoping he will
&gt; be willing to do this. he was willing to replace a stud in a head, that
&gt; I had torqued to 33ft lbs when it was suppose to be 13ft lbs... but thats
&gt; another story....

I'd make sure I was watching the procedure.  Most shops want to shove the 
sniffer up the tailpipe instead of checking at the port upstream of the 
catalytic converter.  You might type out the procedure and take it with 
you, then ask the shop to follow it.

&gt; can someone define &quot;pinging&quot; for me? I read this in the archives/list
&gt; all the time.... and could possibly be hearing it.... if i knew what it
&gt; was...checked the muir sounds page, with no luck.

Pinging is pre-detonation of the air/fuel mixture, i.e., as the mixture 
is compressed it explodes on its own, without waiting for the sparkplug 
to fire.  On older cars with lots of internal carbon buildup the 
compression ratio is effectively raised to the point that your regular 
gas doesn't have a high enough octane rating to prevent this from happening.

If your car is pinging you'll typically hear it when the engine is 
working hard, e.g., accelerating rapidly, driving up a hill, etc.  Sounds 
vaguely like marbles being shaken up in a coffee can.
