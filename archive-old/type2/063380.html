Subject: busy fixin' weekend

Hi. This weekend I finally got some nagging problems fixed on the '66. Went
to Ecology Auto Wrecking with two friends from work. One guy was looking
for Hyundai parts; he found everything he needed. That place is Hyundai
heaven! I was surprised that there were only two beetles, two breadloafs,
and two vanagons in the whole yard. Last time I was there in May there were
lots of the above, some type III's, even a 411/412. I don't know if this
reflects a trend; I'm sure I'll have to go back in a couple of months to
find out. The biggest surprise was finding a '63 camper tucked way into the
back of the yard. It was last registered in '83, but the body wasn't very
rusty at all, although the rear end was somewhat damaged and the wheel
wells were cut. All I got from it was the speedo, for which they charged me
a whopping $10.50, with no warranty. I tested it by hooking the speedo
cable up to it and driving while holding it in my hand; it works! I also
got the frontmost engine tin that goes in front of the air shroud and over
the tranny from a superbeetle, an antenna from a '70 Deluxe, and some
stainless steel fuel line tubing.

I spent the rest of Saturday installing the front engine tin (thanks
Clara). It went in rather easily after I figured out how to remove the air
ducting associated with the doghouse oil cooler (I have a '72 beetle
engine). There are two screws that need to be removed: one holds on the
elbow-shaped piece, and after that piece is removed, the screw holding the
duct opening can be removed. I cut the tin where the accelerator cable tube
goes through because I couldn't figure out how to remove the tube. I got
the fuel line to go through the engine tin without TOO much excitement,
although it seems that my 4-year-old is inexorably drawn to gasoline leaks
while I am trying to fix them :O. I used the stainless steel line to go
through the tin, and insulated it with fuel line so it won't rub against
the tin. The tin seals the compartment well; I am pleased with it. I can
now hear air being sucked into the engine compartment while standing
outside the bus :).

Sunday I bled the brakes. Three of them were way out of adjustment; now I
know why my pedal was so spongy :). It went off without incident. Three of
the brakes were dry on the inside, but one was dirty and greasy. Would this
indicate leaking brake fluid, or something else? I have to add about 1
ounce of brake fluid a month to the reservoir. Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance,
