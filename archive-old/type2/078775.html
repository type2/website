Subject: Idle speed rises/increases while stopped (MTF)

Volks,

This is in the way of a memo to the file (MTF), just to get it in the
archives.

A week or two ago, someone posted that their idle speed was climbing while
they were sitting at a light.  I didn't respond, but was reading the (few)
responses with great interest, as I was having the same problem.  In
addition, I was having a mild bucking (backfire?) under heavy
acceleration.  I had hoped for confirmation of what I *thought* the
problem might be, but no one mentioned it, thus, now that I have solved my
problem, I want to enter it in the archives.

Symptoms:

  o Idle speed rises from ~800-1000 RPM to ~2500 RPM while you are
    sitting at a light.  Only occurs after engine is warm;

  o Bucking under heavy acceleration;

Cause:  Defective decel valve!

Solution: Replace.

I thought it might be the decel valve for a couple reasons.  First, as far
as I am concerned, the decel valve works by magic.  I have no idea what it
is *supposed* to do, but I do know what it does if you disconnect it...
it makes your engine idle at ~2500 RPM.  Altho my corrent symptoms were
not this constant high idle, that it was creeping toward that figure made
me suspect that the decel valve was involved.  Further, the problem did
not get worse when I disconnected the decel valve.  As I expected, the
idle went to 2500 RPM and stayed there.  I.E. no other factor was causing
the idle to go even higher.  Interestingly, a check of vacuum revealed no
irregularities as far as I could tell.

Last weekend, I went junkyarding with Barry Burneskis and we got a used
decel valve.  Condition unknown, but I have never had one go bad (before),
so I figured my odds were good.  Today, I went over to Pat Flynn's place
in Annapolis and we replaced it.  On a loaf replacement is a one-man job,
but on a Vanagon two are *required*!  On the way home, I had a low and
steady idle and no bucking at all, no matter how hard I punched the
throttle.  No real response to a &quot;punched&quot; throttle but as it is a Vanagon
Westy, I was hardly expecting one :-)

One last point is that currently, at least, new decel valves for vanagons
are still available, tho at a cost of near $100.  Don't know about bays,
but it's worth checking if you need one.
