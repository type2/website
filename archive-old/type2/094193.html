Subject: Time to rebuild my '79 Westi

Where is the best place to either to buy an engine or get the parts for a
complete rebuild . She now has 150,000 on the original motor and it's time .
She leaks oil and burns it , plus she is starting to knock ( very litely )
on the bottom end . Also , I hear they make heads that DO NOT have the
problematic dropout seats , where can I get those as well ? Thanks - proud
1979 2.0L camper .
