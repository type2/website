&gt; &gt; should use a brass washer of appropriate size, or try to fit the OEM
bushingin the hole?

&gt; The washer could work if it's thin enough. How are you going to attach it?
If the OEM bushing doesn't fit it will probably travel and tear.

Whoops, I meant brass bushing.  The hole may be too big for the OEM bushing.

BTW, do you have an index of the diagrams that you have at your website?  I
need to look up the turn signal breakdown and wondered if it's at your
website.
