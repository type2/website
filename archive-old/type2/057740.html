I've been trying to post ofr several days through Netscape and the messages
keep getting bounced back. I'm trying this through Eudora...



I have a '71 bus that I have owned and enjoyed for the last eight years or
so. It  is on its second engine rebuild since I have owned it - actually,
the engine in it now is a total replacement, as the old case was cracked
under the oil cooler. Which brings me to my point of puzzlement...

This thing eats generator pulleys. Tears them up where the shaft goes
through. I have a whole collection of trashed pulleys accumulated over the
years.  I have been through three different generators and have changed
fans, all to no avail.   I figured that the problem would go away with the
new engine, but NO! The darned thing went out again on a recent road trip,
causing the engine to severely overheat, as the generator light was not
functioning properly. AAAARRRGH!!!!

I keep the belt tension adjusted as recommended and do not have any extreme
driving habits. This is a stock 1600DP. Has anyone else encountered this
problem before? The VW heads that I have talked to are all puzzled by this
phenomenon. I have used german pulleys, brazilian, and whatever else was
available - it eats them all equally well.

Any thoughts?

Russell
