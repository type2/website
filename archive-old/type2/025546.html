Hi John,

Actually, U-haul Really shafts you on the one-way tow worse than on a local.

 When I went down to New Hampshire, it was cheaper to tow the dolly 700
miles than it was to rent it for a one-way haul. And the risk of getting
down there to find the dolly wasn't there was too grim to contemplate.

As I mentioned off-list, there are usually ways to get around what they
*want*, so you get what you need.

Let us know how you make out with your rig.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; 
&gt; Have you tried to do that local? Lots more expensive.
&gt; Also, they want you to have a class three hitch, which
&gt; I'm too cheap to put on my POS Isuzu P/U. (P/U in more
&gt; ways than one.) I've rigged up a system similar to one
&gt; that I read about in the archives of this list, gonna
&gt; test it on my bus tonight, and put it to use tomorrow.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for all your suggestions, folks.
&gt; 
&gt; -John Cloonan
