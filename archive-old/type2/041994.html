&gt; How rare is a 1958 panel with double door on both side? How many could have
&gt; been produce in the 50's, I understand that it's probably hard to have a
&gt; straight number, but what will be a good guess?

Double door on both sides? Hmmm...sounds like a Verkaufswagen (sales wagon--
ice cream trucks, sidewalk beer sales and the like) to me. Does this one
have a raised top?
