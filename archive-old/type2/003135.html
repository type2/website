    My question.... What does a weak cylinder do to a plug that would
require you to replace it at 5K intervals? I have a small prob on startup
when cold, the engine seems to run on 3 cylinders for about 30sec. then
fires on 4. Doesn't happen again till the engine is stone cold.  I'm
thinking just a bad plug.
