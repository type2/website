 Subject: Mexico Topes and Propane Tank Clearance


 &gt; I've been planning a 3 month trip to Mexico and I'm worried about the
stock
&gt; propane tank under my 79 Westy.  There is only about 8 inches of clearance
&gt; between the skid plate and terra firma and I'm afraid one of Mexico's
&gt; notorious topes (speed bumps) or a huge pot hole will sneak up me and
cause
&gt; a catastrophy.
&gt;
My wife and I took her westy down to Bahia de los Angeles in central Baja a
few years ago.  The road was better than we expected.  The worst was a
bridge washed out by a flash flood around a blind corner.  Suddenly the road
was gone.  The river bed was dry thank god, I just took my foot off the gas
and road through the gravel river bed.  Even with that, nothing hit the
bottom of the bus.  We did however have 3 tires blow during the trip.  Make
sure yours are very good before heading south.  We came home on used tires
&gt;from a llantara.  It cost $15, but they got us back to the border.  Sears
replaces the entire set of michlens, they had all delaminated.  The wire
birdsnest mounted where my spare tire belonged was enough to convince them.
    p.s.  When driving in Mexico, if you see a small roadside religious
statue with burning candles, drive very carefully.  The truckers light the
candles and say a prayer that their brakes will hold out on steep roads.  I
think some of the trucks are held together by prayer only.  You can tell the
severity of a bad corner by the number of burned out wrecks left from recent
crashes.  There are also crosses set up with flowers at sites of fatal
accidents.  If you see the statue, candles, the burned out cars, and the
flowers and crosses, drive really carefull.

Hasta la vista,
    David West
