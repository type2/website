Subject: Breather Line Replacement, Fuel Tank

I was pulling the breather lines and replacing all vacuum hoses. What are 
the pieces supposed to be made of that run the span over the tank, there is 
two of them. Mine were like a steel line possibly heavy copper. They fit 
very snug into the new vacuum line, but don't have that original aura to 
them. I thought they were supposed to be plastic.

I was also looking at htis piece that I though was an elbow turns out to be 
a Tee. I know that the vent lines form either side of the rear engine 
compartment tie in here. Where does the other port go to? Is this supposed 
to go to the air cleaner?
