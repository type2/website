Subject: push-rod retaining wires

Does anyone Know what purpose the push rod retaining wire serves? I've got a 
75 bus and I noticed that the wire is wearing a grove into the push-rods. 
One rod was worn dangerously deep (about an 1/8th&quot; all around). I'm assuming 
that I installed the wire incorrectly but I can't find anything that 
explains how it should sit in the head. Should this wire be in contact with 
the underside of the push-rods? Mine are.

Thanks,
Darin
