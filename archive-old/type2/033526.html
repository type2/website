only one I'm getting duplicate email from is you, so it may be in your
e-mail setup.  (is the &quot;echo&quot; off??)

&gt;    Sorry,  no to both questions, no relation. And no keyboard allthough I 

sorry can't help you with the relative, But

&gt; wish I had a simplified keyboard as I can barely operate this one. My wife 

no wonder you have trouble, the common keyboard was designed over 120
years ago by a gun maker to INTENTIONALLY SLOW YOU DOWN.  Proffesor Dvorak
under a contract to the Veteran Administration ergometerically designed
the DSK or Dvorak keyboard and made it public domain.  It is the second
most popular keyboard in the world.

I have been using the Dvorak keyboard for about 10 years and touch type at
about 65 words a minute with it..! (and no lessons).  the best part is you
probably already have the keyboard, it comes free or built into most
computers....if you are using Windows 95 or 98 follow these instructions

from the desktop
.  double click &quot;my computer&quot;
.  double click &quot;control panel&quot;
.  double click &quot;keyboard&quot;
.  select &quot;Language&quot; 
.  click &quot;properties&quot; button
.  select &quot;US Dvorak&quot; for keyboard layout (you may need your instalation
disk if it was not originally loaded)
.  click &quot;OK&quot;
.  click &quot;OK&quot;

for more information or for other computers and software visit the web
site

try it, you'll never go back to the archaic keyboard again
