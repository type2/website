I would love to touch base with anyone still running an HPBus

&gt; Any chance of getting the list administrator and members to submit
&gt; pictures of the different varieties of Westy type conversions that can be
&gt; put on a link so we can see what the various configurations look like?.
&gt; I'm sure I've seen a lot of Westy type units but it certainly is
&gt; confusing. I know some are very rare and  I see many list members with
&gt; nonstandard conversions that were special ordered or modified.
&gt; A picture gallery of side mount accessory tents would also be nice.
&gt; A home page link could accomplish this task nicely and serve to educate
&gt; us type confused list members.
