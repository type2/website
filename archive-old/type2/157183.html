Subject: vanagon seats in my 77 Bay

I'm looking for a set of Vanagon seats in the PNW, preferably on Vancouver Island or Lower Mainland due to shipping costs. My seat in my 77 Westy is broken on the drivers side, and it's pretty much impossible to fix, as it's the metal &quot;band&quot; around the seating area that holds the spring tops in place. After sitting in Vanagon seats I've decided if I have to replace the seats I might as well upgrade to Vanagon seats too. Are there any issues in using the Vanagon seats in a 77 Westy? Do all years fit? Any info would be helpful.
