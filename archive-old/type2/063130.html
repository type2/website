Subject: Waving

 I'll tell of another group who don't wave.

 Guy has a totally cherried out Splitty and I'm going by in Ole Spot

 He just sits up there and pretends he doesn't see me.

 Like I'm the poor relation and he's embarrassed.

 Snob.   :-)

 I've had this happen half dozen times.

 Other than that we have a great bunch of wavers up here.     west
