Subject: More 'Suddenly no power...'

List,

Thanks for all the ideas and tips on my suddenly weenie '78 2 liter.
Tried everything suggested thus far except for the clogged cat/con
idea (the guy at the muffle shop thought I was nuts when asked to
take a look at the rig.  He said &quot;...the little mice inside can't
run that fast if there's a clogged converter.&quot; Ha ha. . .).

Here's what hasn't worked:

1. Clean batt. and ground cables, charge battery
2. Conduct distributor wire pulling test with consistent rpm drop on all 4
3. Compression test a little low but all over 105 and even
4. Pulled temp sensor (II) and tested.  This is a neat little device
   that checked out perfectly when exposed to the low heat of a hair
   dryer.  Impedence went from 255 ohms at room temp to about 4 k-ohm
   when things got around 180 F.
5. Wiggled and cleaned most of the wires at least once-zip.
6. Pulled the gas line for a second time (good clear Amoco 91 Octane came
   out) and installed a new fuel filter 'cause I was there

# 6 is the only thing that made any difference.  The engine could rev.
a little higher but still had poor power.  A new symptom appeared--the
oil light now comes on a idle and must be adjusted quite a bit higher
to prevent it staying on.  This engine will start perfectly on one turn
at 10 below zero.  It now starts very hard when hot (reminds me of my
old 914 in the summer). Its now running a little more roughly at mid
to &quot;high&quot; rpm.

Next phase of inquiry:

1.  Cold start valve (it does seem to be running rich)???
2.  Failing fuel pump (that new filter did help some)??
3.  Fuel pressure regulator??

Any more advice appreciated and helpful.  It really sucks working on
the old girl laying in the snow at these temps!

TIA
