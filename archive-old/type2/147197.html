Subject: Free '73 Westy parts bus in Eastern Massachusetts

Hello List,
I will soon have in my possession a '73 Orange Westy that is sadly only 
good for parts. It's pretty rusty. The guy I'm getting it from said that 
the rear torsion arms are rusted through. I'll be taking the engine, 
transmission, and one inner door handle :) for sure, maybe some other 
misc. pieces when I get it to my house this weekend.

Most of the westy interior is there. I know the sink unit is missing. 
The front beam was replaced by the previous owner and looks good. All 
the glass is present and in tact. Body is very rough. Pop top is there. 
It is currently drivable, but with the condition of the frame I wouldn't 
consider it road worthy.

I don't have the space to keep this bus around very long. I'm having it 
towed to my house on Saturday, hopefully taking what I need out by the 
end of the weekend, and it will be hauled to the junk yard unless 
someone wants to come and get it. If you want it and can pick it up 
soon, its yours for free. It will be located in Yarmouth, Massachusetts. 
Please let me know if you are at all interested and I will hold off on 
making arrangements with the junk yard.

I can be reached at this email or at e_goodwin3_at_hotmail_dot_com
