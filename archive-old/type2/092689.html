Subject: Re:Fuel injection question about 76 two liter

Date: Tue, 04 Jun 2002 08:01:17 -0700

 &gt;With all this discussion, I guess the obvious question is:
 &gt;Is this part available new anywhere? Or does it now carry our favorite
 &gt;part number, NLA?

 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
VW parts department computer shows it as &quot;obsolete.&quot;   Which means there 
might be a few still on shelves at dealers somewhere. The part # is 022 129 
967 AC.
California Imports catalog offers an intake boot elbow for buses 78-79 and 
same item for Vanagons 80-83, cost $39.95,  without a listing for earlier 
model years. The diagram shows hose nipples at different locations than for 
my 76. But it might fit otherwise.

Fixing the old duct or finding a used one is the path I was forced into. 
And fixing the old one only took a few hours. It is presently doing its 
task and the engine is running again.

And a marvelous enthusiast in California is sending me a used one. Thanks 
all for your help.
