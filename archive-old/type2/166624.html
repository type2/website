Subject: 12 volt water pump died

Hiya:

Just ordered another pump from Bus Depot and am
wondering what to do with it when I get it?  I tried
the archives for installation instructions, couldn't
find.  I have the champaign edition with stove and
sink but holy cow, do I have to take the whole
shelving under the sink out?  the instructions
(Volkswagen Official Service Manual) I have are for
the non-champaign and seem to have a drawer in the
ice-box cabinet which I don't have.   

Muriel ('79 Westy) and I live with each other in
Victoria and travel Vancouver Island for work. Hate
not to have the water working on the road and would
love to fix it myself.  

Any help would be very much appreciated.  I read most
of the emails on this list whether I understand them
or not ;)  I know Muriel is impressed.  

Youse guys is great!,
Connie
