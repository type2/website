&gt; I am sure both of you mean the storage box/stool that sits between

&gt; is: 76-79
&gt; seats sit taller because the passenger seat swivels. The correct
&gt; box will be
&gt; the same level as the seats. Both boxes have the same side

&gt; Good luck finding one with the original yellow plastic covered

Hey there,

Karl is right when he says good luck finding one, I spent over six
months checking all the vw classifieds sites, everyday, for a stool
for my 79 westy deluxe. I got lucky and the one I found had the brown
plaid that matches my interior. [and no, it didn't come with the
yellow plastic trash can].

The stools were only available as part of the deluxe package, so look
for ads from people selling/parting out the westy deluxe interior
(stove and 'fridge).

If you find a stool whose fabric doesn't match the interior of your
bus, don't let that stop you from buying it, you can always recover
it using a piece cut from the underside of one of the cushions from
the top bunk. You only can see the top side of the cushion anyways.

I used the fact that the stool I bought didn't have the yellow
plastic trash can as a bargaining tool, to get a lower price. I've
yet to see a yellow trash can, so if someone has a picture of one I'd
be interested in seeing it.

The stools (like the rear tables), can get in the way, and they are
sometimes removed by PO's and stored away in garages and cellars,
never to be seen again.  Expect to pay about $40 and up for one in
decent condition.

Hope this helps,
