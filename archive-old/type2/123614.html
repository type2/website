Joel,

I am fairly sure that the tank was steam cleaned and sealed. Chad had 
it done at the same shop at the same time the one in A-wagon was done.

If you can see fuel flowing through the filter and it is clean then 
move on towards the electrical. Do you have a coil you can swap out? 
The dumb thinks can be flukey.

Check the electrical connections-
Hot to the coil
- wire to the dizzy
I do not recall if you have a 009 or 205 but if 205 then make sure 
the ground wire in the dizzy is firmly connected.
Check all the plug wires and the HT from the dizzy to the coil.
Check the wire to the cutoff solenoid and make sure the solenoid is in tightly.
Will you are checking the solenoid grad a 13mm and make sure the carb 
is tight to the manifold. Vac leaks there are troublesome.

The tach bouncing may simply be reflecting erratic RPMs of a rough 
running motor. Of course the wire to the tach is connected to the 
negative side of the coil. If that wire is grounding somewhere that 
it should not be it could be causing an ignition problem. If it 
continues to be flukey try disconnecting the tack from the coil and 
see if that cures the problem.

Please report back! I hope you get back on the road ASAP.
