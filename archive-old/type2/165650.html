&gt; Hey Gang,
&gt;
&gt; Here in Maryland (depending on the county anyway) we are using up to 10% ethanol in our gasoline.?
&gt;
&gt; I am aware of what this &quot;moonshine&quot; has done to my father's boat (not pretty, he had to replace all fuel lines and rebuild all three carbs).?
&gt; I was wondering if any one heard, seen, or experienced any problems with this stuff and what can we do to counter act the effects.
&gt;
&gt; I am guessing that engines are running leaner, due to the fact the water is soluble in ethanol, but not gasoline?? If so, should we be running richer than factory specs?

If your fuel lines are reasonably new (as they should be) you should have
no problem with incompatibility.

If the fuel is truly 10% ethanol (the number stated is a maximum), you
will be about 5% lean.  I've never noted any problem here in California
where we've been stuck with &quot;oxygenated&quot; fuel for years.
