Subject: Click...no start; Solved in an hour.

Hi Volks,

This afternoon I took a look at a local bus with a starter problem.  
Is this approaching an epidemic, or is it just me?

I got a call from the owner last night. He told me that when he  
turned the key the starter would click but would not turn over. The  
engine was recently rebuilt and the mechanic told the owner that the  
starter just needed a tap with a hammer to engage. I installed the  
starter brand new just last spring, the bus is a 1975 auto westy.

I agreed to have a look at it. I figured it would either need contact  
cleaning, a relay or a rebuild. In that order.

First step was to verify the connections. Everything was good.

Second step was to verify voltage. That required a trip to Canadian  
Tire to get a $9.99 voltmeter, as mine was left at my office in  
Mississauga. We also bought a relay kit and some connectors, and a  
24&amp;quot; ground cable to run from the engine to the battery.

When we got back I hot the starter with a hammer to light up the  
engine and we put the bus up on ramps to make for easier access  
underneath with a creeper.

Voltage measured a good solid 12V at the solenoid, and at the  
ignition. So I figured the starter needed a rebuild, and started to  
take it apart. First I put a socket onThe 13mm bolt on the  
solenoid... It was only finger tight. I tightened it up and told the  
owner to hit the starter, and it lit up immediately. Problem solved.

While I was there I cleaned up some wiring that the engine rebuilder  
left hanging, and re-connected the dual-battery relay and auxiliary  
heater fan. An afternoon well spent.

Happy trails,
