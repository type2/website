Ok so I have verified that the black box was removed and tossed by previous 
owner. Bently looks like the later models used a different method and some 
models just have a one piece speedo cable. Am I mistaken or could I just for 
forgo the EGR box on my 80 Westy and put in a single speedo cable.

The problem might be that I will not be able to find a replacement EGR black 
speedo box.
