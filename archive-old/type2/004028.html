Jeff, with the lists help, you might be able to set this thing back to it's
original condition. If you need a picture clarification on other part in the
AFM, i'm sure I can snap a macro shot of it.

But you might still consider a remaned AFM. I did that (this is my spare
now) and it cleared up a lot a hesitation and flat spots in acceleration. I
think my wiper track wore out. My resistance values were jumping all over
the place on troubleshooting.

&gt; Chris-
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the excellent picture! That's just what I needed to see. I'm
&gt; going to try this evening to bend that arm back and see if I can make it
run
&gt; correctly.

&gt; I Can't offer much advice as to HOW it should look inside, but I can offer
&gt; this picture of my spare. It looks like the metal arm in question is bent
&gt; WAY to far back. Sorry for the rather larger download, but Iwanted to make
&gt; sure you could see all you needed.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Hello list-
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm in need of a photo of the top inside of an air flow meter.. mine's
&gt; &gt; out of a '76 Westy. Daisy's been in the hands of strangers for the
&gt; &gt; last 2
&gt; months
&gt; &gt; and someone screwed with the airflow meter and bent up some of the
&gt; contacts
&gt; &gt; and &quot;whatnot&quot; inside.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; She runs with the air flow meter disconnected, but will not run with
&gt; &gt; it connected. I've put a picture up on my website with a circle around
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; part
&gt; &gt; in question... I think it's bent but I have nothing to compare it to..

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks!
&gt; &gt;
