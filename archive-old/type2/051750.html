Subject: [T2] heater help

okay,
i finally installed the new heater cables..lubed them up and in they went 
with no problem.  here's the problem....

when i originally opened the package...they were difficult to move.  i 
thought...no biggie, plus i didn't know how much force you would need in 
the first place, because the original cable were messed up and 
non-functional.  so, when completely installed, i can open the flappers by 
pulling down on the lever in the dash, but to pull it back up would bend 
the cable.  the bracket in the dash that holds the 4 cables (over the 
cables) tends to have too much force placed on it to make it not stay in place.

is there some sort of additive spring mechinism that i'm missing?  there 
was a spring dangling on the body by the flapper, but it wasn't connected 
to anything...note...the heat wasn't working in the first place.  the force 
of the spring in the flapper isn't enough to pull the cable back and close 
the box.

so, there is too much force on the cables to get them to work...are the new 
cables bad?  am i missing springs? if so, where and what do they do?  how 
hard should it be to move these levers in the dash?  the current force pops 
the black metal bracket off the &quot;4-cable holder&quot; which is part of the whole 
lever assembly.

i really need help with this...i'm beginning to get pissed at those who are 
trying to help me here.....and it isn't their fault!
