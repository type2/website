Subject: re physics of impact on front mounted tires

(yes there is bus content here)
Whoa- depends on what you hit and the area of the impact and your
assumption the tire is rigid....now tell me, George, about this common
sense approach:
   If you run into a pole with a radius of 4&quot;,  the bumper and mounting
&quot;tube&quot; of a later bus will deform in the area of impact and SOME of the
front may crumple in depending on the initial velocity.  I parted out a
74 bus that had such an impact; perfect mold of the pole, but the frame
behind was hardly affected....the welded on bumper &quot;tube&quot; took most of
the force.  Do this with a 72 or earlier bus and likely it will
push/crumple the unsupported bumper (mounted only with brackets) right
into the body and further deform the corner in front of your feet. There
is no welded tube to take the stress across the front of the bus.  Now
put a tire there- it will indeed push the skin in if you hit it dead
center with little help of the front bumper tube.  This may help in an
early bus, not in a later bus.  I still suspect the tire will
deform/absorb impact as it can act as an &quot;airbag&quot; if hit off center.
     Run into the front bumper or corner of an 18 wheeler, and I'd bet
the broad tire would allow less intrusion into the knee area than if it
pushed into the skin with no tire there!
   There are those who worry with a front mounted engine that it can end
up in the lap upon hitting an object, but remember it has forward
momentum as you impact, and actually helps by absorbing the impact over
a broad area as it crumples up; the mounts are designed to &quot;give&quot;.

&gt; The presence of a rigid and lightweight wheel on the front of a bus will
&gt; do little but ensure that an additional object will intrude into the
&gt; passenger compartment if you hit something.  It doesn't provide crush
&gt; space (it doesn't crusb before the sheet metal), so it is relatively
&gt; useless.
