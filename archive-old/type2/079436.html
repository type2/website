Subject: Re: Bus-Life, Literally

I just spent the night in Wally Worlds lot a few weeks ago.  I just pulled in
to a group of RV's and had no problems.  And if you know my bus, that is
saying a lot.  http://geocities_dot_com/snoopyvwbus/SnoopyBus.html Pan to the
bottom for a recent pic.

I have heard Wally Mart allows camping in some of their parking lots but maybe
that is just an urban legend.

On our way to Everybus this year, Wal Mart security freaked out when our
caravan of 11 buses rolled into their parking lot! One of our group overheard
security being told to order us off their property! When we informed them we
were there as customers they lightened up, but I sure wouldn't try to spend
the night in one of their parking lots-although I do see a lot of big motor
homes in the lot of the one in town.
