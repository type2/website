Subject: Re: [T2] mudflaps

From: &quot;Richard Atwell&quot; &lt;ratwell_at_mac_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Seems samba and eBay are the only online places left and they are bidding
over $100 for $25 mudflaps w/o mounting hardware. sigh...

If someone could send me the rough dimensions for the mud flaps, height,
width, and thickness, I could calculate the rough selling price for making
repro's of them.

BUT, and that's a BIG &quot;but&quot;, I won't be able to use the VW logo (for reasons
obvious to all).

Several ideas for replacing the logo:
  1. A &quot;V&quot; in a circle on the left flap, and a &quot;W&quot; in a circle on the left
(My favorite, and I think that it's legal to use).
  2. Left: &quot;Bus&quot;, right: &quot;Freak&quot;
  3. Left: &quot;Bus&quot;, right: &quot;Lover&quot;
  4. Left: &quot;Big&quot;, right: &quot;Bug&quot;
  5. Left: &quot;Loaf&quot;, right: &quot;Love&quot;
  6. Left: &quot;My&quot;, right: &quot;Bus&quot;
  7. Left: &quot;Her&quot;, right: &quot;Bus&quot;
  8. Left: &quot;His&quot;, right: &quot;Bus&quot;
  9. Combinations of the above, and/or suggestions welcome.

My casting supplier is coming out with a new resin that I believe will lend
itself quite well to the mud flap issue.  Whatever the &quot;logo&quot; is, it can be
cast in a contrasting color to the black of the flaps.  Not painted, and
quite permanent.

I'm not sure about mounting hardware, and I'd need access to at least one
decent condition pair to get the shape and dimensions correct (to borrow,
not keep).

Thoughts?
