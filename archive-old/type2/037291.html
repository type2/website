I wouldn't either.
As far as i have been able to deduce, wear in valve guides mill mainly affect
the cooling of the valve itself; the more distance between the guide and the
valve, the less heat transfer between the guide and the valve, hotter valve=
shorter valve life.

As the guide wears, you would probably start burning a little oil and
eventually the valve loses its head.

I really don't se a direct line of causation between p-rod seal leaking and
valve guide wear, nor do i see a relation between comoression and valve
guides.

&gt;      Would you pull the heads with only 29,700 miles on the engine?  I
&gt; rebuilt this engine for the PO in 1996.  I used all new or rebuilt parts. 
I
&gt; thought it had 35,000 on it but when I checked the reciepts it has only
&gt; 29,700.  As far as the heads go, I would not pull the tin to re-torque the
&gt; top bolts unless the bottoms were more then a couple of pounds out with a
&gt; clicker torque wrench.  The oil drip out of the pushrod tubes is less then
1
&gt; quart in 2000 miles.  It is a very tiny drip.
