Subject: New German Tents, Web Site Down, New Host Wanted
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hey Campers!

I have some new German side tents arriving this week, and as always, I offer
list discounts.  Here is the link for my web pages, which appear to be
currently down, as they seem to be almost every weekend.  
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://eurocampers_dot_com/&quot;&gt;EuroCampers Home Page&lt;/A&gt;
(www.EuroCampers_dot_com)

I will be looking for a new host this week, and I would like to hear
recommendations from anyone who has been with the same host for at least 1
year or more, and has had little or no problems.

For now, I'll work on reactivating my old AOL site, and post when it's back up
and running.

TIA
