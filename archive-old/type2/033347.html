Hi,
 
&gt; .. to apply the color I want. ...  I have not had a tire store mess
&gt; up a freshly painted rim.

&gt; &gt; The rims on my bus are fairly heavy with surface rust, I want to
sand
&gt; &gt; blast them and paint them. 

 Remember to clean the paint off the mounting holes before driving off.
If the mounting surfaces are painty then the wheel nuts can come loose
as the road vibration loosens the paint. 

 This is a bad thing.

Cheers,
	W.
