So per a request I got I made up a list of all the articles I have in the 
series from H*tVWs. That way if any of you have any magazines your hiding 
in your basement, and some of them are H*tVWs :), you might find you have 
them already...

March 89: Canvas and Seal replacement on the pop-top
May 89: Adding a gauge package (Tach, head temp, oil pressure, voltmeter)
June 89: Installing a 1907cc engine and Transform &quot;Freeway Flyer&quot; tranny
Sept 89: Drilling rotors and drums for better performance
Dec 89: Bodywork
Jan 90: Interior work, including recovering seats and carpet
Feb 90: Stereo install
March 90: Sagging rear end and rear sway bar install

I think I might have overlooked one or two because I remember a sliding 
door adjustment article I wanted to find for myself. While I was poking 
around I also came across some other articles...

July 90: Type4 engine rebuild
Dec 90: One of my personal fantasy's a 5-speed conversion to a bus tranny 
with a 2.75&quot; extension between the tranny and nosecone which gives enough 
room for a rabbit 5th gear as low as 0.71. Cost was $1500 (in 90) besides 
the customization necessary to mount a tranny that was now almost 3&quot; longer 
then before.
June 95: Type4 valve seat replacement
July-Aug 95: Building a 2813cc Type4 at FAT Performance

As I post articles I will post URLs to them. Look for the sagging rear 
article this weekend.
