Hey volks, I'm back after being off the list for a couple months.  I never
unsubscribed, anyone know what happened?

To try and make a long story short, I am now going on month 18 of not having
a bus under my backside.

This weekend, I embarked on a trip 2 hours north to the Lake Mille Lacs area
of Minnesota to hang out with some friends.  This is a perfect trip to take
in a bus.  However, I was forced to take my winter beater which, at the
moment, is a 1985 Buick Electra Estate Wagon.  Just the name by itself makes
me cringe.

The weather was raw and wet when I left Friday morning.  45 miles up Hwy 169
the Buick started running very rough and I lost power brakes at low speed.
Great I thought to myself.. just what I needed.  I got to the hotel and
missed the first entrance because I could not make the Buick slow down fast
enough without power breaks.  The brake pedal was rock hard.  Let me tell
you, driving a full-size American station wagon without brakes is scary.  I
finally slowed down enough to make it into the parking lot and park the car.
At idle the car sounded like it was only running on 4 of the 8 cylinders.
It was pouring rain so instead of looking at it then I pouted and checked
into the hotel and went to bed very depressed.  There is no feeling worse
than being stuck 120 miles from home especially when you are an anti-social
geek with limited friends like me.

The next day I popped the hood and started drying everything off and checked
for vacuum leaks and was getting frustrated.  After an hour I gave up and
called AAA for a tow to the closest garage.  Expecting the worse I waited
for the tow truck.  About an hour later this older gentleman shows up with
his wife in the passenger seat.  &quot;Garrison Service Center with 36 years
experience&quot; proudly written on the side of the truck.  He asks what is
wrong, tells me to start it and pop the hood, and starts playing with the
carburetor.  2 minutes later the engine is running nice and smooth and power
brakes have returned.  Somehow, the secondaries on the 4-barrel were staying
open causing more fuel to enter the engine than it could burn.  Time for an
oil change!

So, Sunday morning comes and I start heading back home.  Miserable weather
again and I am the only one on the road at 3am.  As I make my way down the
wet highway, I start to thinking about how cool this trip could have been if
I only still had a bus.  My bus never let me down and if something broke I
could fix it!  I thought back to the spring of 1996 when I took that 4300
mile/10 day road trip out to the North East and back in my 1972 Bus.
Whenever I have drove any of my VWs in the past it was as if I always had a
close friend with me.  Now, I am scared to drive and almost hate cars
altogether.

But, in the end I made it home with no problems.. only a headache from
thinking of so many things in such a short time period.

So there we have it, I am back.. I am still wannabuser trying to save up
cash for a '71 or earlier (split-screen Sundial or early deluxe preferred)
Bus or Single Cab with a solid body.  However, it looks like the prices for
decent busi keep rising each year.  Searching the classifieds I came across
TWO busi for over $19K.  That is obscene.  But, that is a different rant.

Thanks for allowing me to vent.

- JT
