Hi !!/

I personally agree with fact that probably 1cc will not affect the performance of
the engine, but,  it is also true that when you have the oportunuty of upgrading
it to a higher capacity and you'r putting all your efforts and money into it, you
have to be sure that everything is well done.    Go ahead and do it !!!!

Now,  my question:
===============
I'm sure most of you have noted in the &quot;Hot VW mag.&quot; of this month an add about
the MAHP   6 stud heads that don't leak.   I found  very interesting the
possibility of raising my original 1,679cc engine into a 2,242cc using this kit
with the 104 mm liner and pistong set.   David,  Paul, Jhon: Are this the heads
that you have been refering to ??.   I would really like to have your opinion.
Thanks.

Also if someone has something to say (good or bad) I would really like to know
their comments too.  Perhaps 104mm is to high ??.  I could also try something
smaller like a 96 mm and have less cooling problems.

Thanks once more and best regards,
Pedro/
