&gt; Subject: [T2] AFM Problems(long)
&gt; &gt; Hello All!
&gt; 
&gt;      Today my bus died( its been running great), with no warning, and
&gt; would not start, after messing with it for an hour in a parking lot,
&gt; with the temp. in the teens and snowing. I finally call the tow truck
&gt; had it towed to my friends shop. I knew it was the AFM, but we checked
&gt; everything else to be sure,(fuel pump_at_35psi, Relays, vacuum lines, spark
&gt; to the plugs) everything checks out.
&gt;      OK less then two years ago I replaced the AFM(with a rebuilt Bosch)
&gt; after my bus backfired and blew the AFM apart. This time my bus did not
&gt; backfire, It just died. The flapper is normal meaning its not flopping
&gt; around like the old one did. So what gives?? Any idea's or things to
&gt; check? Any help will be great! Oh Ya! Its a 79 2.0l stock FI, pertronix
&gt; ign.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

Shawn-

I had an AFM go that I never really figured out what happened. I've
resigned
myself to thinking the temperature sensor in it died. A bit of a pain,
but
not worth me worrying about.

If you have access to another AFM, just swap them. I've used units from
various
years with no real problems. My 77 probably has a computer from a 78 and
an AFM from
an 81 in it. Works fine (aside from below, which isn't related)
 
***
On another note, as of late, I seem to have to adjust the valves more
than normal. I don't
know if I'm not tightening the adjustment nut properly, or if there is
something more
insidious at work.
 
I've made 2 round trip tickets between Iowa and Steamboat Springs, CO
(which involves roughly 3 Divide crossings per leg) and each time I've
had one of my cylinders start to misfire. What causes a valve to tighten
up?
 
This last time, the engine will run rough and misfire on one cylinder
until it warms up a bit.
 
What's likely going on here?
 
I plan to readjust the valves, again, as soon as the weather permits.
The weather has turned seriously
bad in central Iowa and it's just going to have to wait a few days.
 
I'm nearing 50,000 miles on my ultra-GEX rebuild. I'm frankly surprised
that it's held together this long.
While I do take care of it, the engine does get a little abuse and some
neglect (never low on oil,though)
nearly 20,000 of those miles have come since this past August.  I've
driven a ton of other vehicles during
my short existence on planet earth.  I've never gotten nearly the amount
of friendly waves, smiles, and awed
looks from envious passerbys as I do in the my van. We traveled from
Iowa to British Columbia, Washington, Idaho,
Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Illinois, South Dakota, Nebraska, Indiana,
Michigan, West Virgina, Virgina, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky. Literally from sea to shining sea.
Amazing times we live in. The world looks
better from a van.....

time to return to hibernation
