Subject: Re: [T2] piston weights

&gt; &gt; So, I weighed a spare replacement piston that stan sent me (cuz my other
&gt; &gt; one's got a hole in it) and it was 1.2 ouces lighter than my others.  Is
&gt; &gt; that going to make a big difference?  and yes, they both had wrist pins,
&gt; &gt; c clips, and rings.

1.2 Oz!!!

1.2 oz X 28.35 grams/oz = 34.02 grams

Better re-weigh that one.  It sounds like a totally different piston.

Good Luck
