Subject: tires and heater insulation
Message-ID: &lt;372606C3.455EDE43_at_mail.ripon.k12.wi_dot_us&gt;

Ok.....I know a lot of you bus drivers out there are still &quot;hippies&quot; and
whatever people call us...but I was thinking this summer when everyone
is free there is a Phish concert at Oswego Co. Airport in New York....I
don't know if anyone else is going but I am taking my bus and my friend
is taking his bus.... a 71 and a 72 both orange...woo hoo!
If anyone is interested mail me and we could meet up...Its a 2 day show
with camping in between the 2 days so...150 bucks both days and
camping...WELL worth it...anyways...here goes.

ok...this will be the last message of this type...sorry..
but I do need to know what people are running for tires...I need new
ones...i live in wisconsin and will drive them on a 71 hardtop westy in
the winter and summer...I've heard 185R14 are pretty good....and I do
plan to get reinforced walls so...
and one more thing....on the busses there is the heating hose that comes
up to the front of the bus from the engine....to fix the notorious VW
heater problem....could I insulate this hose somehow?? or would that get
in the way and damage something?
I'm thinking a thicker hose possibly wrapped with something...or just a
thick hose...
thank you very much!
Isaiah
