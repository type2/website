Subject: Re: [T2] My new Hankook RA08s

You're gonna love them.  I was amazed when I got mine.   That's a pretty good price, too.  But you make me jealous when you  talk of camping in CO.  I need to make that trip sometime.   I've got a good friend in Dillon I've been promising to come and  see.  Have fun....KR

rated tires and my new Hankook RA08s is amazing.  I cannot describe how 
much better it is.  Unfortunately I was unable to support our familiar 
vendor with this one.  There was an authorized Hankook dealer about 20 
minutes away that ordered the tires from Hankook.  4 days later and $330 
lighter (after taxes)
