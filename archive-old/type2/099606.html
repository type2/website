Subject: Re: [T2] Hopefully last starter problem question

&gt;OK, so, I have now taken the starter out of the car,
&gt;and got it to work fully one time, but now it still
&gt;just plunges the solenoid without engaging the motor
&gt;at the same time.  I can't seem to find a solenoid to
&gt;purchase by itself, and am scared that that may not
&gt;solve whatever the problem is.  Pretty much, the more
&gt;I investigate the problem the more I get confused.  I
&gt;would like to replace a $10 part and have it work, but
&gt;can you buy parts for the solenoid?  I think I may
&gt;drop the cash and get a new one.  Do I really need a
&gt;bosch?, the checker down the street has an autolite
&gt;for about $40 cheaper than rebuilt bosch's.  Advice?

Two options: take it to a local rebuilder for an estimate or diagnosis for 
small $$$. Replace that solenoid and take a chance. I'll bet the solenoid 
is your problem. Can you power the starter by applying the cables directly 
to the starter terminals? If so that says the solenoid is bad.

Be sure to tear it down and clean + grease everything while you've got it 
out. Check shaft bushings for wear and brushes for wear.
