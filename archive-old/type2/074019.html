Subject: Re: [T2] seat mounting bolts


Thanks, that was where I saw them before. $65 for new huh? Guess I'll start
looking around at junkyards etc, find some used. Looks like only the clamps
themselves are the unique item, the bolts look like carriage bolts that
have been ground flat on the sides. Seems like I was able to use regular
carriage bolts when installing my camper interior, though I might be
remembering wrong.

It's possible then that what I have is a non-folding backseat. It does have
an armrest on the right side so it looks like a middle seat. I haven't
checked to see if it's legs line up with the mounting points for the middle
seat. The backseat that is there has the folding back. I have a set of
seats (with 2/3 middle) from a champagne edition that I can use instead,
though the cordorouy inserts are dirty. My wife really like the full width
middle seat. Was the right 1/3 flip an unusual option?

&gt; Someone recently posted to the list that they were now carrying middle
seat
&gt; mounting hardware. But I can't seem to find it at any of the vendors that
&gt; frequent the list. I tried searching the archives but the &quot;most recent
1000
&gt; posts&quot; search doesn't seem to work at all, and the older archives pulls
up
&gt; peoples requests for this hardware.

Here is a vendor on that auction site that has them:

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/aw-cgi/ebayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=596996964&amp;r=0&amp;

t=0


&gt; Also, what years were full width solid back middle seats available? I can
&gt; only seem to find the 1/3-2/3 folding back wide middle seat upholstery.

Solid back???  I have never seen solid back full middle seats. Either right
1/3
flip for right cargo doors or left 1/3 flip for left cargo doors or both
ends
flip for double doors.
