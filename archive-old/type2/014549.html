Subject: 12 months to a fine 2.0 L engine
Message-ID: &lt;23fa495f.252a3bea_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Mark Hineline gave a very good summary on this subject, but I would make a 
few warnings to a new engine builder:



&gt;Third month                Average cost: $300

&gt;Take or ship your crankshaft, fan and hub, flywheel, clutch and cover to 
&gt;a machine shop. Have them regrind the crankshaft and then balance the 
&gt;unit (fan, shaft, clutch and flywheel). Cost increases as you approach 
&gt;the demand for zero-balance.

&gt;Meanwhile, study Tom Wilson.

Tom Wilson's book is very informative and I've had a copy for years and used 
it to build both a 914 and a bus engine. Both times, I followed his 
directions on setting the crank and cam to TDC and his directions gives you a 
setting EXACTLY 180 DEGREES OFF and the new engine obviously won't start.

Another area of concern is installation of push rod tubes so they won't leak. 
He recommends RTV which lasted only a short time for me before new leaks 
sprung and I got to do them over with new tubes. A discussion of how to 
install the tubes and seals so they won't leak would be very helpful.
