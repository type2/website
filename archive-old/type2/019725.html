I've never used a flux core wire feed welder, but I've owned a 110V gas mig
welder for many years.  I use C25 as the shielding gas (25% CO2, 75% argon). C25
is much cheaper than pure argon, and works better on carbon steel than pure
argon.  C25 gas bottles use the same thread as argon bottles, so your argon
regulator will fit the C25 gas bottle without modification.  As long as you have
sufficient shielding gas present in the weld heat zone, you will get a nice
smooth weld.  The shielding gas isolates the weld from oxygen contamination and
also fluxes the parent metal.  I only get spatter when my shielding gas runs out
or I forget to turn it on.  So I would say your spatter problem is due to
insufficient fluxing/shielding of the weld, and it doesn't sound like you have
much control of that with flux core.

I keep the torch tip about 1/2  to 1 inch away from the work, but its not real
critical.  My welder only has two heat settings, which are just different
voltage taps on the transformer.  I use the low setting for light guage metal
like car bodies, and the high setting for heavier stuff.  Wire feed speed
determines how much daughter metal you will pile into the weld, and therfore the
amount of residual heat and parent metal distortion that will occur.  On light
gauge metal, best to start at the lowest setting and raise it as required.

Also, it can be very frustrating to try to butt weld two pieces of light guage
metal.  You usually end up burning back the edges, no matter how hard you try
not to.  Best results are obtained by overlapping.  There are panel flanging
tools sold (try eastwood_dot_com) that will form an offset lip on one of the metal
edges, so you can get a nice flush surface across the two joined metal pieces.
