Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure sender, 914 oil temp sender plate and vacuum port

I use alot of the 914 oil sender plates....Rarely do they interfere badly
with the dipsstick...In my bus I  slowly rotate the dipstick until it slides
by the sender, and completely into its location...

&gt; Dear Steven.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your e-mail regarding the oil-temperature gauge sender unit
&gt; thread size being M14 x 1.0mm and its part number.
&gt;
&gt; Which engine type (1972~79 VW 17/18/2000 Type 2 or 1980~83 VW 2000
Vanagon)
&gt; have you installed it on and what modification if any, had to be made to
the
&gt; oil dipstick, to prevent it fouling the sender?
&gt;
&gt; For the VW 411LE Variant engine, in my 1973 VW 1600 Type 2, I suspect that
&gt; some shortening of the dipstick would be necessary. I too might be
&gt; interested in obtaining one of these Porsche 914 engine plates, with
&gt; oil-temperature sender fitting boss.
&gt;
&gt; However, I am currently waiting to see whether I can obtain from an
&gt; acquaintance of mine in Great Britain, a 220V AC mains, oil sump heater,
&gt; which replaces the standard plate.
&gt;
&gt; Looking at your pictures of the oil-pressure gauge-sender installation,
&gt; without any spacer mast or adapters, I wondered how you screwed it into
the
&gt; crankcase, suffiently tightly, to get a leak-free seal and prevent the
&gt; sender unscrewing itself. Did you first have to remove the inlet manifold
&gt; pipes and the large cover-plate, which covers cylinders 3 &amp; 4?
&gt;
&gt; I tried out your method of installation, using some old junk cover plates,
&gt; requiring an enlarged hole of &gt;43mm diameter, but rejected this method in
&gt; favour of the spacer mast and banjo fittings.
&gt;
&gt; The problems I identified, were those of sealing around the hole in the
&gt; cover plate and the inconvenience of removing the inlet manifold and cover
&gt; plate, in order to remove or replace the sender.
&gt;
&gt; Regards.
&gt;          Nigel A. Skeet
