Subject: Re: [T2] AC Conversion to new &quot;Freon&quot;

If the system is currently working, just leave it alone.  If it is empty 
but hasn't been exposed to the atmosphere, just charge it with 
Freeze-12.  If the system has been opened up to the outside air, you should 
replace the drier, evacuate the system and then charge it with Freeze-12.

Can you tell I like Freeze-12?  The article I wrote that is in the library 
is a few years old - I have learned some things since then.  134a will 
work, but Freeze-12 will work better.

&gt;What has everyone done to convert to the new still Freon (will new what
&gt;10 years ago?).  I'm thinking of buying a Bay Window, until the Split is
&gt;done, and it has Air.  The system has never been converted over.
