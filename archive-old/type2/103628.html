Subject: Re: [T2] Rear wheel bearing re and re

&gt;&gt; Is it imperative to remove the rear bearing housing from the bus to replace
&gt;&gt; the rear bearings? This is on a '79.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The Bentley states that the bearing housing is to be removed to do the job,
&gt;&gt; but I wonder if this is absolutely the case.
&gt; 
&gt; No the inner circlip can be a real challenge though.&gt;

How difficult is it to remove the stub axle from the housing? I mean how
much pressure is required. I just did the bearings on my VW thing and the
axels were easy to drive out with a copper hammer.
