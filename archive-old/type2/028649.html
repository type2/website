I'd like to know more about a heat shield too.


Same here in Chicago.
hot and humid.

After a long 2 hour jaunt, I pulled into a gas
station and
couldn't start the bus. Thank God I didn't destroy
any of the
relays thinking that they were the cause.

Clicking sounds and fuel pump but no starter, I
knew
the trouble was the starter solenoid. Hammering it
wasn't my first
idea and luckily I had a 8 gauge wire, striped the
ends and crawled
under the bus... you'll need a friend to crank it
over and spit. spit.
bang. zap the leads on the starter and braoooom we
were on our way.

If it's the heat, and I think it is cause I've
never had this problem
in the winter, the only way to shield the starter
is by sewing a jacket
of automotive hood insulation around it.
I've seen them for sale like that in the VWtrends.

I think that's what I'd do. The stuff comes with a
shiny foil side and
that snowmobile boot insulation on the inside.
Take two pieces, cut out
a nice little jacket and sew them together so that
the foil is exposed on both
sides. You can even rivet some buttons to it.
It'll be like a starter burrito
or maybe more like a gordita. OK Andale!
