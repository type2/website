Subject: [T2] re: '76 FI Bus woes


Hello all listees, thanks for you past help with my thermostat &amp; other
difficulties.  I'm still searching for a cable attachment &amp; the housing if
anyone can help (or recommend a website?)
Right now, the issue I'm having is that my bus will start only when I apply
steady gas to it. After ten minutes of this, it will run on it's own
(somewhat).  The real issue however is that when I decelerate, the engine
will bog down &amp; stall.
Can anyone suggest what I should look for?

Thanks all,
Sean
