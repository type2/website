Subject: [T2] Brake Warning Light on while driving

Howdy All - The other day my brake warning light came on while driving and is
more or less on all of the time, except when I press on the brake pedal. Checked
brake fluid level - a little low, but nothing odd - topped off. Since braking
itself doesn't seem to have changed, I am suspecting one of the pressure
switches on the master cylinder. Also, the vacuum boost hose is properly
connected at the engine manifold end - haven't looked at the brake cylinder end
yet. Anyone familiar with this symptom? Is there any way to test the switches
without draining the system of brake fluid?

Many Thanks,
Ron Johnson
