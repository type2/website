&gt; Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; The short form:
&gt; 
&gt; I am planning to install a 1.7L egine in my '73 bus. Easy?  Stock?  Yes
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; camshaft is worn, and needs to be replaced :-(((
Gee, Steve, I've got a new stock hyd. camshaft in a box that I'd be
interested in selling(most of the projects I can see on the horizon
would probably use a one step above stock cam)
&gt; Should I use the 2L flywheel/clutch?
Yes, a better clutch for a couple of reasons, plus the starter is
different, too
&gt; Should I look for a used 002? (or at least an 002 bell housing?)
No, see above
&gt; 
&gt; What about the FI?  Will it work  (I can't think of why not, but...)
It worked for me one time when I fried the original 2.0 motor on my 78
due to faulty temp sensor in the afm. The motor I used was a 71 411
motor which has higher compression ratio than a 73 bus, has the same cam
as the 914 or m/t 73 bus. The cams differed in 73&amp; 74 between them/t and
a/t: there wasn't much difference, but the a/t cam is a little softer,
shorter duration, and therefore has more bottom end. Tis is the same
profile that was used by all 2.0 liter busses and ultimately redesigned
to be the hydraulic cam. My whole point in telling you this is that my
1.7 411 engine was a little hotter-I think 75 DIN hp as compared to 66
DIN for the 1.7 bus. Anyway it performed just fine, the gear ratios were
good and everything. It was a little more spirited, peaky motor- it
needed to be shifted more often than the 2.0 but it worked just fine. I
even tow-barred a 912 Porsche cross country with it!
&gt; Should I start looking for a set of dual carbs/stacks/linkage? (this
&gt; engine has a dual webber on it right now)
Nah, unless you need it to pass smog test. I think I might have a set
off a 74 in my attic someplace, but the FI works better.
&gt; 
&gt; What was the original smog stuff for this year?  do I need a smog pump?
74's did I'm sure, 72's did not, 73's might have been mid year change.
Some parts will be REALLY hard to find, I do have a pump drive assy (was
saving it to drive a housing mounted a/c compressor when I put a 2.0
type 4 engine into my 67 912, but after thinking about it for 12 years
or so, I think I'll just put in a 911 engine- they're so sweet and not
very expensive for the 2.0, 2.2, 2.4 motors and they bolt right in after
changing the mount brackets on the car).
&gt; (VA has gone to full visual on smog stuff back to '67 (Oh, you lucky
&gt; Californians!)
Makes it real easy to love Iowa: no inspections, no helmet laws, just
hot and cold and humid!
I'd be much more in favor of just taxing the pollutants at the pump,
(this is p-mail, not the list, mostly because of my offer to sell you
stuff)and not worry about creating hardship on 5000 or so motorheads
whose collective smog savings wouldn't be substantial even if you
confiscated all their cars and had them crushed. No, I'm not a ultra
right gun-totin anti-government type, just a liberal libertarian whose
bull is close to getting gored! :-)
Also, I was wondering is it proper to post things for sale to the list
like they do on the Vanagon list? I'm mostly thinking things like the 71
only intake manifold that was discussed recently- I've got one I'll
never need (I'll put in a type 4 motor first!:-)), things like that. I
don't recall seeing much stuff for sale on the list and thought it might
be verboten.
