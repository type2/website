Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temp Gauge Mounting

I have good luck sticking gauges in the glove box door. either you can cut
yours, or get one from a junk bus, and install it, then make the
cutouts.....this way your original is left  intact and the dash as well..

Subject: [T2] Oil Temp Gauge Mounting


I'm trying not to overheat another engine so I have bought a VDO Oil
Temperature Gauge for the 72 Weekender.

Up to this point I have been able to keep my dash original with no cuts, I
have a Sunpro tach in the clock position now.

Has any one else wanted to avoid cutting their dash and found the &quot;perfect&quot;
place to mount it without looking UGLY and having wires to exposed?

How about the mounting of the sending unit, it read to tap a hole in your
oil drain plate, any other suggestions? If I do end up taping the oil plate
any one have a suggestion for a block plate or something? I would hate to
break it off, the only concern is on campout where you might get into a rut
or something, haven't bottomed the engine out yet.

Thanks to all of you that can help and the best of bussin to the rest of us
:-)

This time next week I hope to be on my way to Picasso Moon, a Full Moon Bus
Club Camp Out! If you didn't make it last year I would suggest all the folks
close should come, it is an AWESOME camping spot!
