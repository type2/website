Hi Steve,

I remember very clearly meeting you and that bus in Opal VA, on the way 
to Everybus 2001. It was midway through the third day of my first long 
bus trip, and our carabus caught up with you and Sean Bartnik. 
Following your splitty through VA and into NC was a very memorable 
experience.

Hopefully I will see it at EveryBus 2005 with a better interior than it 
had in 2001:

Yes, that is daylight coming through the D/S door well.  Now that 
Kelly's done with it, it'll certainly be a lot less drafty!

Happy trails,

&gt; Those of you who have been here a *long* time may remember when I

&gt; an
&gt; old 1967 hardtop camper.  Well, that bus went down to Kelly's place in
&gt; North Caolina and Kelly did a whole lot of work to get it back into
&gt; rust-free condition.  He just brought it up to Mark Deering in Virginia
&gt; and Mark has about done the final body work and paint and is in the
&gt; process of putting it back together.  I went down there yesterday to
&gt; deliver the bumpers for painting and took a couple of pictures. They
