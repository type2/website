Message-ID: &lt;5a5b9f1b.2487e6d1_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

i am in dire need of a new engine in my 73.  i plan on taking it out to 
rebuild myself.  unfortunatly the bus is a work vehicle and time is money.  i 
would need to put a new one in, then do my rebuild over the next month or so 
as i have time.

so has anyone had any good experiences with avp engines??  did they come 
caked in rtv high temp sealer?? (am not real thrilled when a company uses a 
lot of rtv to *seal* things), do they come with a warranty??  do any of you 
have REAL stories of mileage, oil consumption???  

my second option is to buy a rebuilt or used running engine that one of you 
list members might have lying around.  i found one in california rebuild and 
balanced, and the guy wanted $700.  that was in my price range but i am in 
nebraska.  too long of a drive.  but i may have to if i find nothing else.

please help.  thanks,zac
