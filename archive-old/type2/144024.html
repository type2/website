Subject: Re: [T2] Ham Radio with a Westie

This field day, I finally inaugurated my Westfalia radio shack with 
spectacular results!  Five years in the making, the station features:

- a 1978 Westfalia Deluxe, currently under restoration
- an Icom IC-706MkIIg
- an SGC-231 w/interface http://www.ham-kits_dot_com/Tuner1.htm
- Andersen PowerPole

and the piece de resistance --

- a 16' Shakespeare M.120-60 HF antenna system with 4257 vehicular mount and 
custom fabricated, heavy gauge steel mounting bracket

http://shakespeare-military_dot_com/hvpds.htm 
http://shakespeare-military_dot_com/catalog/military_products-p03.pdf

So how did it do?

Our main HF station, an old Kenwood TS-520, failed and we had to press my 
rig into operation unexpectedly.  Actually, it was not completely assembled 
yet!  However, it was methodically planned over the previous five years and 
so it took only a few hours to finish the job.  Everything worked perfectly 
on the first go.  The PowerPole was wired to the auxiliary battery, the SGC 
coupler was mounted to the rear of the clothes closet, a special extremely 
high voltage rated insulated wire running from their, through a grommetted 
hole, through the engine compartment, through another hole cut near the 
mount on the driver's side to the antenna mount.  The rig itself was 
operated from the swivel table, although in the finished installation the 
control head will be mounted on the dash, and an IBM ThinkPad will control 
both rig and WinLink operations from the rear position.

Using CW, my preferred mode, I worked every station I heard with excellent 
results.  Hell, I was even able to make a CW contact on 160 METERS!!! 
Granted, he did have some trouble copying me, but I am amazed the darned 
thing loaded on 160 in the first place!

The QRN was low, the bands very quite, even with the engine running to 
recharge the auxiliary battery.  The only noise apparent was the occasional 
static of a thunderbolt somewhere.

Other observations:

The weather in Philly was OPPRESSIVE.  96* and 80% relative humidity. 
Sitting in the parking lot of our county EOC/911 center, the interior of the 
Westy was comfortable.  More than that, it was pleasant.  When I went 
outside to connect the power cables to the auxiliary battery, the full 
effect of the weather hit and I was drenched with sweat in the five minutes 
I was there.  Inside was cool as a cucumber!

The Westy table made a fine operating platform, although I have the Go Westy 
reproduction table which tends to wobble.  I really need to find an OE table 
with its sturdier base.  Also, I need to drill yet another hole for the 
heavy-duty power cables to the engine compartment.  While I have HD cables 
running to the rear-seat storage area, they are for a stereo amplifier, and 
the ground does not go to the battery, rather it connects with the 
refrigerator.  I want a separate circuit for the expensive again 706.

I don't have any photos yet, but maybe I  can get some this weekend and post 
them on our website, www_dot_delcoares_dot_org.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I just operated Field Day and am wondering what antenna solutions people
&gt; are coming up with for operating out of a westie?

Well, I have a deluxe, not a westie, but I have operated portable from it.

I have a lashed-up antenna support structure consisting of a 2-section
extension ladder and two pieces of PVC pipe nested one within the other.
The whole thing is assembled in an extended position on the ground and
tilted upright by two people.  The ladder is guyed by four ropes to stakes
in the ground.  This gets the antennas about 40 feet in the air.

I pull the dipoles up to the top of this setup with a cord and pulley
setup.  I use broadband coaxial dipoles (sometimes called &quot;Double
Bazookas&quot;)  These are good for an entire band without a tuner. I feen them
with an Icom 751A. I have one for each band 10-80m

I used this setup a couple of years ago for a special event station (W7V)
at BBB in Havasu.  Didn't have a lot of time to work, but made contacts
all over the US and as far away as Japan.

For field day operations, my club's specialty is a 1/4 wave vertical on
160m!  This is done with 135 feet of copper wire, some trash bags, and a
cylinder of hydrogen!  It works pretty well even though the top band is
not very active on field day.  We make a few contacts and then reel in
half the antenna to put it on 80m

For mobile use, I use an Icom 706mkIIG with an Icom AH-4 tuner driving a
stainless CB whip.  The tuner and whip are mounted on the luggage rack
with the whip canted back 45 degrees to keep it under the height limit.
This setup will tune the whip from 6m to 80m with the push of a button.
It isn't as efficient as a screwdriver or bugcatcher, but it gets out
pretty well.
