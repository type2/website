Subject:  * $199 *  Side Tents  - $69 Awnings!

For years, I and other people who use a side tent on our campers have been
singing their praises.  They double your available space, giving you a place
to spread out your stuff so you're not trying to fit both youselves and all
of your belongings inside your bus when you camp.  They're great for kids.
And they're a godsend if it rains.  My family uses our all the time.  But
it's expensive and bulky to carry around; mine takes up most of the space
above the engine compartment in my Westy when it's packed up, and at about
$600 it was a heck of an investment. Understandably, a lot of people feel
that they just don't need one badly enough to justify the cost and the loss
of storage space.

This tent is just $199, and INCLUDES a sleeping cabin (which normally sells
for $100 by itself).  This is literally half the price of the next cheapest
alternative.  And it hardly takes up any space at all when torn down.

It's big - 9 x 10 feet when assembled - yet it packs down to only 10 x 30
inches (and fits in its own bag).  Two sections can be raised to form
awnings.  There are zippered flaps with mosquito screens for ventilation.
Its domed roof prevents rain from collecting on the roof.   Like other side
tents, it attaches to your bus's rain gutter via a pole that sits in the
gutter and clamps that hold the pole in place.  So there's no need to mount
anything permanently to your bus.  There is a zippered door to enter the
tent, and another that allows you to access the sliding door of your bus. If
you drive away from the campsite, just zip that door shut and it becomes a
free-standing tent while you're gone.

Like most European tents, it doesn't have a floor. But a separate sleeping
cabin clips into the interior of the tent, turning part of the interior into
a fully enclosed &quot;tent within a tent&quot; (complete with a floor, for sleeping,
changing, etc.).  This, too, has mosquito netting, as well as sewn-in
pockets for stashing small items.  Whereas the sleeping cabin is a $100
option with most tents, it's INCLUDED with this one.

This tent was designed by Just Kampers in the UK specifically for VW Busses
and Vanagons; it's not a generic &quot;van tent.&quot;  We and Just Kampers went in on
it together, and the volume savings are what made this price possible. The
$199 price will probably go up at some point, but I'm starting the first
shipment at a cheap price in order to recop most of my initial costs.

Is this as good as a $500 or $600 tent?  No.  It's nylon, not cotton, and
frankly not as robust in construction as you would expect if you paid
several  times the price.  If you're going to use it heavily, spring for a
higher-end tent.  (We do have a nice step-up model, for $299, plus $99 more
for the sleeping cabin, and of course there are others out there for
hundreds more still.)  But if, like many people, you're likely to use it
just a few times each season, this is probably all you need, and a bargain
at the price.

You can see a picture at http://busdepot_dot_com/tent.JPG .  These are en route
from Europe and won't be here for about 3 weeks.  If you order in advance,
you won't be charged until it ships.  Part number A0097; you can order
online.

Also, I have (coming in the same shipment) a simple awning for your Bus.
Like the tent, it clamps to the rain gutter, so it's easily taken up and
down, with no need to install hardware on your bus.  It's about 9 x 7 feet,
and includes guide ropes, stakes, and poles. At just $69, it sure beats a
tarp and duct tape. :-)  There is also an optional side wall that you can
velcro to either side to shield against sun or rain, for an extra $49.  Part
numbers are A9032 for the awning, and A9033 for the side wall.

I'm really excited about these.  For this price, everyone should get one.
