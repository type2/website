Max,

Rods sound right, but $60 for heads sound really really cheap.

What are they doing to them for $60?

Not to screw up a good deal on the heads if it is good, but what *are* 
they doing to them?

Cheers, dave

&gt; BUS CONTENT: My case is headed out to the machine shop to be align-bored and
&gt; to have the end thrust cut. The crank will be polished, is that necessary? The
&gt; shop recommends I buy a set of refurbished rods for $50 rather than do the
&gt; work on my rods such as sizing, aligning, and putting one bushing in. Seems a
&gt; little crazy to me. My heads are being done at another place for a total of
&gt; $60. Does anything seem out of the ordinary or is a ok?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks all,
