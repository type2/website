Subject: heat exchanger support

&gt;re-attach all the hanging straps for the heat exchangers

Hmmm,   does anyone care to elaborate on these ?   I can't recall seeing
any 'Hanging straps' on my '71. A type2 search came up with one reference
to these.

Says Steve Dolan ( round of applause please everyone, for all list admins !)
&gt;Ideally, the heat exchangers are hung from the engine block by metal
braces.....

Is there a hidden graveyard somewhere for these along with 'the Hoover bit'
and thermostats and vanes, for I can only recall attaching mine to the
exhaust ports, muffler and ducting. I spent a lot of time and money getting
the things on so I would hope they don't jump off because I didn't notice
something that wasn't there. Where do the straps attach to the exchangers
and where on the block ?

Thanks,
Darrell
