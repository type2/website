Erik:

Diagnosing noises over the internet, relying only on the written word, is 
tough!  But two thoughts come to mind:

1) You're hearing detonation (pinging) typically caused by a
   too-advanced ignition timing.  If it sounds something like
   you'd imagine marbles would sound hitting the bottom of a
   coffee can, that's probably what you're hearing.  

2) You could have geneally worn lifters, that make noise when
   the engine is accelerating.  But worn lifters will usually
   leak down overnight, so I'd expect you'd hear this noise
   in the morning, while idling after start up, until they
   pumped up.

I'd start with number 1 and check the advance on the ignition.

&gt; To my dismay, it was covering up another noise - here are the specs -
&gt; 
&gt; - 1979 2.0, hyd. lifters, FI
&gt; - only upon acceleration, or revving up the engine
&gt; - never when deaccelerating
&gt; - it sounds like a freaking diesel engine - coulda coulda coulda coulda
&gt; (really fast and deep)
