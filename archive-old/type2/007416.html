Subject: mistake on carbs in 74 bus for sale
Date: Sat, 24 Oct 1998 01:26:15 PDT

Hey Y'all,
  I told everyone that I am selling a 74 Sunroof Bus with dual carbs and 
at one point thought that it had Webers. Then I said that they were 
Solex's. This is true. They are Solex's, stock Solex's. I didn't know 
that they made type IV Busses with dual carbs, but I have a manual that 
shows them and how to adjust them. So I didn't mean to mislead anyone, 
the Bus is completely stock. It is nice to have the big motor and not 
have to screw with the F.I. I will tell you how it runs tomorrow.
   What years did the type IV busses come with carbs? 72-74? And what 
was the first year for the disk brakes? It was the first year of the 
small 5 bolt pattern wheels, right?
