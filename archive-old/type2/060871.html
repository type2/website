Volks,

I have my 77 Westy insured as an RV:

250 deductible on comprehensive
$100K/300K liability
0 (Zero) decuctible on all glass!

Price? $223 per *year*. This is less of what I would normally pay for 6
months if it were not an RV.

In addition, it is *liscensed* as an RV and because of this, I don't
have to go thru emmisions crap.

It's worth looking into.
