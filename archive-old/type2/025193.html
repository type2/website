I use an impact siezmographer chronographic quartz watch. $14.59 at Radio Shack. You just set it to impact mode and it tells how many ft-lbs of hammering you're doing. Carpenters use them all the time to make workmen-compensation cases for carpal tunnel syndrome. Kinda hard to get 235 ft/lbs out of it, but I just imagine I'm hammering on the PO...really improves my strength AND stamina. ;)

Seriously, if you have to be precise, you have to use a torque wrench or a socket and longbar and math (see Muir)...but you can't get it exactly right and line it up with those holes anyway. I've always just gone as far as I could and then I back off enough to get a solid pin in it...then I check from time to time.

&gt;My question is, how do you know how to re-torque the sucker when you are 
&gt;putting it back on?  Hammering the h*ll out of it doesn't show up in any 
&gt;of my manuals as a torque setting.
