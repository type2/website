Subject: 1971 Crew cab wiring questions

Here's hoping somebody can answer these questions.

I'm still working on my crew cab an have some further wiring questions.  The 
truck is a 1971 but I just installed a 1970 gauge panel in the dash.  My 
question centers around the brake warning light.  My factory manual wiring 
diagram shows no more than three wires on this switch but I have at least 6 
on here.  Can anyone tell me how to hook this up?

Also, if you remove the steering wheel is there supposed to be a spring 
directly under it?  This seems really odd to me.
Please reply via e-mail if possible.

Thanks again.

Dave
