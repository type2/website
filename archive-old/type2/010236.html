two of the best busses I have seen seem to lack the bottom panels that

&gt; the side of the bus - above this is the corrugated metal &quot;floor&quot; - but the
&gt; thin metal panels are missing.

I'd say not since they probably were never there.  Could this be something
exclusively euro?

Never seen a bay that you couldn't grab the frame on - or a split for that
matter.  Maybe you're thinking it should look like the underside of a type1? 
The bug is a unibody = no frame whereas the bus is a more traditional
body-welded-to-frame-construction.

I'd like to know if you have *ever* seen a bus that was not 'exposed'
underneath and who/when/where manufactured that bus?

puzzled,
