Subject: Re: [T2] Solved:Can't get engine back into bus(1600DP in 71)

&gt; [...]

Problem solved.  Even though I had used a clutch alignment tool, I figured that
the only thing that could be wrong was the alignment even though the tool would
glide right in.  I separated the bus from the engine to give myself enough
working room, stuck the alignment tool in, loosened the pressure plate, spun
the disk around,  tightened the pressure plate and removed the tool.  I then
rolled the bus back into the engine and it all went right together.

Don't ask me why this worked because from all indications the clutch was
properly aligned to begin with.

Thanks for the responses.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I just had my 1600 DP rebuilt for my 71 bus.  Rebuilder installed
&gt; &gt; rebuilt flywheel which should be no problem.  I am using the same clutch
&gt; &gt; disk and pressure plate.  I installed them on the flywheel using a
&gt; &gt; centering tool and checked after tightning to make sure every thing was
&gt; &gt; OK.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Problem is I can't get the engine to mate with the transmission.  Get
&gt; &gt; everything together to within about one inch and then it's like hitting
&gt; &gt; a brick wall.  Everything is perfectly aligned.  I've installed engines
&gt; &gt; before and never had this kind of problem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any ideas are appreciated.
