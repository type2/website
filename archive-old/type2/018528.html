Karl von Salzen is the expert here.  But I remember him telling me the 020 and 018 are interchangeable...

&gt;The 018 subs to the 020. Either one will work. Both are 7 pin.
&gt;You are thinking of 75/early 76. This was the 016 AFM. It had 6 pins.
&gt;79 Calif is 022. It has 7 pins but also has a O2 sensor.

&gt; I discovered that my spare AFM is an 020; not an 018 as came with my '77 engine. I recall a recent post regarding the difference between these two, but I never saw an answer. Are these compatible?
