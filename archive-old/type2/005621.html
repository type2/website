Go to a outdoors/backpacking store, which would be the Backpacker where John
lives.  They sell thin elasticized cord by the foot and cheap.  Works
perfectly for this use.

Peace Brother,

&gt; On the left side of the early Westies, there should be an elasticized cord
&gt; running along the bottom edge of the windows to keep the curtains down. Look
&gt; for the screw holes in front of the jalousie and behind the rearmost
&gt; window.... If I had an extra, I'd send it to ya..
