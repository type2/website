Subject: More about brake swaps...

This weekend I will begin to pull off the master
cylinder and booster from a 79 bus to use on a 72 bus.
Obviously the brake fluid reservoirs are in different
locations on these 2 model years, SO should I drill a
hole through the floor and put the 79 resevoir into
the 72 at the same location as it was in the 79 (front
bottom of drivers seat) OR should I use the existing
72 resevoir behind the seat and run the hose to it??
Thanks All!
