Subject: exhaust smell
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello all, I was driving 70 bus last PM and used the heat on for the first 
time in a while and I noticed a strong smell of exhaust fumes in the &quot;warm&quot; 
air coming from the back.  Is this due to a bad engine compartment seal or 
just an exhaust leak back there some where?  Marcus

70 Bus
73 Bus Automatic with bad transmission
77 Bus Automatic (Donor Bus with good transmission, I hope)
