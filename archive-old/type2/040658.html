Subject: Need some bus pictures!

Can anyone provide me with some digital pictures of the underside of their 
68-71 bus?  I specifically need shots of the front shift linkage (back to the 
tranny), the tranny and engine mounts, and the routing of the cables.
I've decided to convert my corvair powered truck back to VW and need some 
reference points.
Thanks

Dave
