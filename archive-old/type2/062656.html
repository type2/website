&gt;I've been driving transporters (and the occasional beetle or Karman Ghia)
&gt; almost
&gt;every day for thirty years and I havn't gotten addicted yet!!  On the few
&gt; times
&gt;I've been vanless I've felt deeply homeless; and every van I passed on the
&gt;street felt like home.  A friend of mine says that his '79 westy is the
&gt; only
&gt;thing which he has which is truly his own.
&gt;
&gt;But despite all the wisdom, grace and reason of V W Van ownership, there 
&gt;is
&gt;still an element of madness to it.....  John Jensen in Annapolis

It's not about madness or addiction...  It's all about LOVE my phriends.
