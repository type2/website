Subject: how to raise the rear part of the sliding door

It seems like the rear part of my sliding door is slightly low.  The 
obvious thing to do would be to raise the catch, but I noticed (even 
when it's at its lowest point), the locking mechanism on the door still 
hits the catch, &quot;bounces&quot; over it, and then latches.  Does that make any 
sense?

So, if you look at my funky diagram before, the lines represent the 
latch on the door, and the OO's represent the round catch that the latch 
wraps around (screwed to the bus frame).  The thing is, the bottom of 
the latch (where the -- are), hits the catch, bumps over it, and then locks.

Is is supposed to work like that?  If you don't know, take a look at 
your door and see if the latch is hitting the catch before it actually 
wraps around it.  I'd be curious to see how it works on other people's 
doors.

Otherwise, I was wondering if there was a way to raise the back of the 
door at the U joint so the latch didn't hit the catch as it closes....

thanks,
mike
