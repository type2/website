Subject: Re: [T2] Restoring Interior

I fabricated panels from 1/8&quot; bendable birch plywood.  I bought two 4x8 sheets, $39 each, and made kick panels, door panels, sliding door panel, drivers side wall panel, both sides rear side panels and rear hatch panel.  The only panels I didn't make are the ones on either side of the cargo area above the engine.  Then I stained them to match my interior and used exterior grade polyurethane on both sides.  Looks great at a low low price!
