Subject: Re: Oil Pressure Too High??

Kyle, Steven, George &amp; Mr. Bubble Head &amp; Eric &amp; Barb,

Thanks to all of you for the quick responses.  All of your answers were
in agreement about the relief and regulation valves being stuck high
would cause the high pressure.

I removed the rear piston (relief) and it had a nice score in it. 
Polished it up with some 800 grit to a real smooth surface.  Did the
same with the cylinder.  Put the piston back up and it moved quite
freely without any hangups.

Repeated the process for the front piston (regulation).  Had to use a
tap to extract it (thanks guys).  Polished up the piston and cylinder. 
Put it back and fired the engine up with no change.  Not having a VDO
meter to mate with the gage/light sender, I used an digital ohm meter
and monitored the resistance.  At idle we had about 68ohms going up to
80 ohms at about 2500 RPM.  Exact same readings before and after the
cleaning/polishing job.  Also the oil drip rate was about the same.  We
lost about an 6&quot; diameter puddle in a 60 second run.

Anybody have a correlation of ohms to PSI for VDO oil pressure gauges?

Eric &amp; Barb mentioned about after market relief valve spring that is too
heavy duty for an engine in good shape.  Of the two springs, that is the
longer one and it seems quite stiff.  I just measured the spring out of
my type IV engine and it required 22 lbs of force to compress it about
an inch.  I'll check the spring in question tommorow.

Thanks
