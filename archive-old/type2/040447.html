Subject: addendum re my cc on valve clatter

Quoting myself yesterday:
  &quot; You can bleed a lifter (see Bentley) by taking it apart,
reassembling
under oil in a can.  I remember you can pump the assembled piston also
under oil, pushing a bike spoke into the center to open a little ball
valve as you watch air bubbles come up.&quot;
     Oops, in looking at my paperweight lifter, I realized that the
little ball valve is in a separate plunger under the top piston
contacting the pushrod.  The piston hole only allows oiling of the
piston sides to seal the lifter.  The side hole is what allows the oil
pressure to keep the lifter plunger up.  Pushing on the piston of an
assembled lifter (in a can of oil) can force air out of the side hole or
around the piston sides.  Personally if I went to the trouble of
removing it, I'd remove the snapring and bleed it completely.  BTW, I
seem to recall my trick to getting that _at_^$%$ snapring back is to push
down the piston and hold the lower plunger in place with  a nail through
the side hole; if you have a 3rd hand, they can hold down the piston via
the center hole while you work in the snapring.
