&gt;How important is it to know the head/oil temperature? I'm sure that
question will start many people's hearts pumpin, so respond directly if you
like. Which one is more important? I have an empty space where my clock
used to be (another e-mail) and wondered if I should consider eventually
installing a temp guage of some sort. 

In order of priority I'd get oil pressure, then oil temp, then CHT.  Oil
pressure gives you an idea of the oil temperature since the pressure drops
as the temp increases.
