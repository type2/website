&gt; ...stuff about blowing foamy oil out exhaust snipped...
&gt;
&gt; Had to get away for a few hours before writing this.  Any of
&gt; you ever had
&gt; that fifth or sixth consecutive problem that makes you
&gt; seriously consider
&gt; selling the Bus?  I think I'm over that, but now I'm trying
&gt; to realistically
&gt; assess how big of a problem I have and what it may take to fix this.

Just this week, in fact.  After driving up into the Sierras during an
incredible snowstorm, breaking two sets of tire chains, crawling over the
mountain passes at 35mph (full throttle), blowing a rear oil seal (I think)
and pushrod tube seals on a rebuilt engine with 8,000 miles, developing yet
another exhaust leak, poor gas mileage, broken heat, and CO poisoning, yes,
I'm considering selling the bus.

Someone talk me out of it.

Later,
Niall (Frances - '76 Westy)

P.S. But damn it's fun to work on and take camping, and will probably be
even better when my baby arrives in a month :-)
