Subject: Pop-top bug screen

Hello Listers:

The mesh bug screen on the front of the pop-top canvas on my '76 Campmobile 
is ripped and in need of replacement.

Should I just put duct tape over the hole or can this screen be replaced?  
Should I take it to an awning or RV shop?  The rest of the canvas is in good 
condition.

Please help.

Thanks and best regards,
Walt Fogle
'76 Campmobile
