Subject: Re: [T2] climbing on board or jumping off the deep end

Thanks for all the help everyone! I have yet to come to a decision, but I'm
pretty sure that I won't get a bus for my daily driver (at least for now
with 3 little ones). You all made very valid points and really got me
thinking about the level of commitment involved. Perhaps a Westy is the
thing for me, at some point when I've got more time and money. Still not
sure what to do about a bigger car (without a payment) for now -- possibly a
90 or 91 Vanagon or 93 Eurovan.

One thing, though, you all threw me off on the fuel injection issue. Sounds
like there are pretty strong opinions on both sides of the fence on this
one. Anyway, thanks again!

Meredith
