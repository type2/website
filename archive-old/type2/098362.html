Subject: Cal-spec fuel filler neck and SMOG

Hi,

I do have a California-spec van, so I need all the
stuff.  :-(

I don't know what the proper neck is supposed to look
like.  Here are pictures of my fuel-filler neck

http://63.161.223.55/~craigoda/77-bus/fuel-filler/

It only fits the unleaded gas pump, so I think I'm
okay.

I'm still deciding what to do - whether to repair or
ditch the van.  So, opinions still very welcome.

For those joining the story late, the full story is
here.  :-(

I have a 30 day permit and I drove the van to work
today.  I have to say that I like the way it drives. 
I think that the dual mufflers and possibly some other
tweaks makes it slightly more powerful.  It sure feels
more lively than my 1983 VW Vanagon waterboxer 1.9L. 
The air-cooled engine is more elemental and zippy. 
The waterboxer combined with the weight of the vanagon
makes it a dog.

You can't pass CAL smog with a &quot;tampered&quot; fuel filler
neck or a non sealing filler cap.

Now if you or the PO drive away from a pump without
removing the fuel 
nozzle 
the filler restrictor can be torn and fall under the
&quot;tampered&quot; 
category. 
This is a eyeball test.

The restrictor is to keep you from using leaded gas
and poisoning the 
CAT 
converter ( required for my 77 bus but not required
for FED 49 state 77 
models). My restrictor was torn and only the FED
version was available 
at a 
reasonable price ~$20. I was quoted $150 if they could
find one at SMOG 
HELP 
(1-800-544-4357 Darron I believe was his name).

I put in the FED version 211 201 199 I think the CAL
version is 211 201
199B. Replacing this part CAL or FED is not fun. The
smog tech looked 
into 
my filler and marked me down for a tampered fuel
restrictor (FED 
version).

To pass I cut the hood off the damaged CAL filler
neck, closed the torn 
restrictor hole by tightening a wire tie around it (it
looked good). I 
left 
the opening lip attached to the trimmed and closed
restrictor. I 
removed the 
metal flange from the fuel opening, applied a coat of
Vas to the 
trimmed CAL 
neck and shoved it into the FED neck and replaced the
flange (4 
screws).
