Subject: distributor pictures

I have been helping someone off-list with a distributor rebuild.  I had
taken a bunch of pictures of a 205E mechanical/vacuum advance/retard dist
that I took apart, cleaned lubed and re-assembled with the intent of
writing up a procedure.  Unfortunately it has been awhile and there are
pics, but no proc :-(  In case the raw pics might be helpful to someone,
tho...  http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/distributor is the link.  And who
knows... someday there may be lemon-scented serviettes.
