Subject: Re: split-window trans ('67 w/3.88)

Ellis sez,
I used a '67 rear end with a Super Beetle 3.88 R&amp;P. Assuming stock reduction
boxes. SP1600 w/Steel Kadrons.
Tends to make the single cab fly. Can easily go 70 but prefer to not burn it
up. I occasionally see splitties in the Grandma lane going really pokey.
Combined with the vehicle age and the desert heat I try to cruise it at 62
and stay out of the way. I think the lack of body weight helps the single.
We need to consider the power vs weight distribution. Now if I could only
get some air flow into the cab!
BTW: Rusty really disagrees with the notion that splitties are not a daily
driver. I also disagree with having to go 0-90 in between in city lights.
Everyone in Phoenix has changed their names to &quot;Andretti&quot; Phoenicians dont
shoot each other (very often) they just run you off the road! &lt;Serious!!&gt; Whew~!
