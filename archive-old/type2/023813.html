i'm using a typical generator in a 71 weekender.  there are two standard
terminals and the D- screw.  at this time theres no wire to this screw
and i know one should be there.  this may be causing an electrical
problem i'm having.  this being a hot fuse where the wire to coil is
connected.  i had an ignition meltdown sometime ago when the choke
grounded to the generator.  after replacing the main wire harness and
patching some secondary wires, i may still have a problem elsewhere. 
anyway, the point of my question is where to ground this D- wire that
i'm going to install.  does it ground to the regulator housing as i
think i've seen on some wiring diagrams, or to the body somewhere?
