Subject: Soft Brakes?

Gang:

I have a 78 Westy, and just replaced the rear wheel cylinders, the rear
brake pads, calipers, and the front brake pads for the disc brakes.  After
bleeding it, my brakes were still soft.  So I took it to a professional
brake place to have them bleed.

$40.00 later they are still soft and the pros said that all the air is out.
They said the brakes were soft becuase the rear brakes needed to be
adjusted.  However, I don't believe this, the brakes harden up on the 2cd
&quot;pump&quot;, so I don't know how this could be a brake adjustment in the back.

There is no leaking in around the master cylinder, nor the front discs.  Are
the pros right?  Can someone confirm?

Secondly, when I install the new cylinders I noticed that pressing in the
piston &quot;all the way&quot; caused some fluid to come out from around the pistons.
Is this normal -- I believe I have seen it before.  Can some confirm?

Kind Regards,
Wayne Berry
