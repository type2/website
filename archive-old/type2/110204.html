&gt;Hiya Zach,
&gt;
&gt;The sprayer jets on a 70 are simple press in moldings. To get them out it 
&gt;would be a good idea to remove the hose.  Then, with a pair of ducknose pliers 
&gt;(or anything else in the pliers family) simply reach up and squeeze the molded 
&gt;&quot;arms&quot; and press forward at the same time.  That should clear the sprayer from 
&gt;the body.  And, as you mention, if you break one of those molded arms, not 
&gt;much is lost.

Reaching up in there in a PITA. There are only 6 nuts holding the upper part of the dash on. I'm not 100% about the 1970 dash but on my bus I take out the dash before trying to work under there.
