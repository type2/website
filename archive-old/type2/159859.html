Subject: adjusting my steering box

Hey Everyone,
I got a new steering box but it's pretty tight and I want to adjust it 
before it gets ruined.  Does anyone have any tips/suggestions on 
adjusting it.  Bentley says new boxes should be adjusted to 21 in. lb, 
but I don't have a torque wrench that sensitive.

thanks,
Mike
