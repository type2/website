Subject: Re: [T2] Shifting problems

BW said:


 Here is my problem, When I got back 200 mile trip the next morning when 
 to work and couple of miles she shifted hard. After work I started her 
 (clutch in) and she jumped forward. I played with clutch cable, everything was fine. 
 I started her again she was fine until couple more miles I had a real hard 
 time getting it in and out of gear.
At I checked out the cable, shifting coupler, shifter, housing 
anything I could fined When the engine not running she shifts into all gears no problems. 

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I would replace the clutch cable 1st, before dropping the engine.

Classic symtom of a stretching clutch cable. It will break VERY soon!
