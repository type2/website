&gt; I didn't know Audi made an aircooled engine.

Yeah, but if you incorporated the Quattro running gear...

A friend loaned me a book that has a picture of a prototype 4WD bay window.
It's sporting some serious rubber and coming up out of a ditch at about a
45 degree angle. I want one. Too bad VW only built five. Anyone out there
have Vanagon Syncro running gear under a Bay?

Still raining, still dreaming.
