Subject: Re: [T2] bus suddenly goes out of gear

rich racioppa sends:

&gt; i was driving home last night, and the woman in front of me decided to slam
&gt; on her brakes, no signal, to turn in her driveway.  I followed suit, so as
&gt; not to bump her into next week, and my bus seemed to 'pop' out of gear, it
&gt; wouldn't go back in, i have little to no mechanical ability (but i am a
&gt; hell of a cook...) any clue as to what it could be, and potential $$$ to
&gt; fix it?

Your transmission's toast, Rich; this is an easy fix that's unfortunately
time consuming and weighty. Also not cheap--figure $350 to $500 plus your
old transmission, plus shipping, for a rebuilt transmission.

With a few strong friends you can do this changeout in a weekend.
