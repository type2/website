Milwaukee eh?
Check out Priske salvage yard between Fort Atkinson and Whitewater on 
Hwy 12 I think it is.  Its about half way in between, on the right side 
if you are coming from Whitewater.  We've pulled a good bit of stuff out 
of there, and they have a decent number of buses.  A buddy of mine had 
them pull a nice front beam out of a bus for him and it ran 100 bucks 
disc to disc.

Sorry, I don't have the phone number off hand.

&gt;&gt; I'm in Milwaukee and,of course, would like to track one down in the Sun
&gt; 
&gt; Belt.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Any suggestions for reputable boneyards in So. Ca., TX. AZ. etc?
&gt;&gt; Any suggestions on where to begin my search are welcome and appreciated.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
