Subject: Where do the gaskets for '72 carbs/manifold go??

Hi.

two intake manifolds and two 32-34 PDSIT carbs are sitting on my work bench, 
ready to be installed on a '72 1.7

I have a whole handful of 'new' gaskets, and I don't know what is needed..

For the manifold, I have   (1) four metal sandwich gaskets (with heat shield 
material in the sandwich, full donut rush);   (2)  two 'Lone Ranger mask' 
black 3/8&quot; spacers;  (3)  four thin metal crush gaskets (thin metal, no 
filler, but 1/2 donut crush)

Do I use all 4+2+4 items, or just the  four metal sandwich gaskets?

For the carbs, I have two black flat 1/16&quot; gaskets. I guess that is all I 
will need, not ant gasket-in-a-tube stuff???

Thanks.
