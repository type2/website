&gt; I finally pulled the woven strand battery to ground strap. I measured the

&gt; certain positions only a few strands were conducting. Maybe some would fuse
&gt; under an increased (lights or starter)load and cause problems. I installed a
&gt; big fat Napa strap and have had no further problems.

I got stuck in Palm Springs once because the braided cable had rusted out
and broken in several places.  After charging the battery with a new cable
on I made it the rest of the way with no problems.
