Subject: RE: Oil everywhere: from where?

As you remember: I have a 1982 aircooled westie. I have had this problem of
oil loss while doing highway driving. 

Thanks to all who responded to my plea. Many good ideas and hints were
offered. The winner is Mr. Bruce Maxson who suggested:

&gt;Take a look at the rubber tube that fits between the case and 
&gt;the tin where the dipstick inserts.  I thought of this because you 
&gt;mentioned that the dipstick is &quot;.. slipping out.&quot;  Is the tube there? Is 
&gt;it intact?  The fan blows oil all over the place, so sometimmes its hard 
&gt;to tell whats actually leaking..

So I did look and found no seal whatsoever at that place. the dipstick tube
was simply dangling in a good sized hole in the top of the crankcase. I
tried several sizes of O-Rings ...but wound up using 1/4&quot; slice of spare
fuel line and this gave a tight seal. Today,I topped up the oil and took it
down the highway doing 65 - 70.... after 30 - 40 minutes of this, I stopped
and saw NO oil dripping out onto the ground. So, this seems to have fixed
the oil loss completely (or nearly so). Time will tell. 

Imagine a hole in the top of the crankcase with air rushing over the
outside of the hole, inside the oil is being splashed around. Might this
high speed wind suck oil out of the top? Might the wind also blow the
dipstick out of the open-ended tube? Hmmmm.... ? 

So, thanks to ALL the listmembers who responeded ! 

Also, you may recall I was having some problem with the drivetrain. This
turned out to be the beginings of a busted tranny COMBINED with a
frozen/nonfunctioning needle bearing. So, now the Vanagon has a good
tranny, new clutch, new rear main oil seal, and new needle and throwout
bearings. Also new CV Boots and repacked CV joints all round. This was done
by some local mechanics... they managed to bust the spade off the reverse
Light switch...so I will have to have that fixed too real soon now.
