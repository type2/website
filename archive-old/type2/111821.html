Sorry to be late with this.

Checking for leaks is a matter of looking at all the places where brake
fluid flows for wet spots.  Start at the resevoir go to the master
cylinder go out each line to the wheel.  On the rear wheels remove the
brake drum and peel back the rubber cups on the wheel cylinders.

The one difficult place to check is the master cylinder to brake booster
connection.  Remove the two nuts fastening the master cylinder to the
booster then gently pull it away from the booster.  Use a paper towel to
check for wetness on the front face of the master cylinder. Try to snake a
finger into the booster.  If it is wet there you will need a new master
cylinder and you will need to remove and drain the booster.  If it has
been leaking for a long time you will probably need to replace or rebuild
the booster.

BUT... Low fluid in the resevoir may not be a leak.  As your disc brake
pads wear fluid moves from the resevoir to the calipers.  Check the
thickness of your pads and replace as needed.  If you do replace you will
note that as you squeeze the pistons back into the caliper that the
resevoir will magically refill.

                             OOK!
