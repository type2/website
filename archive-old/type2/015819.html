One small caveat, the click style torque wrenches can overtorque just like
the pointer type, if you keep on pushing after it clicks.  Try it and see.
Whether you &quot;hear&quot; a click, or &quot;see&quot; the pointer point to 28, you have
received an indication from the tool to stop, and it is up to you to obey
it or not.  The two types of torque wrenches both have loyal followings -
it's almost one of those religious things.  I use the pointer style because
it's cheaper and less prone to failure.  I have a friend with a Craftsman
click style 1/2&quot; torque wrench who torqued his lugnuts to 160 lb/ft before
he realized his torque wrench was broken.  Still clicked, just clicked at
the wrong time.

The bottom line is that torque wrenches are a necessity for major engine
work, and you should just buy one of whichever style you like best and use
it religiously on critical parts like flywheel bolts, rod bolts, and case
nuts.  You really should use it on every bolt or nut you tighten, but in
the real world things like carb hold-down nuts can be skipped if you have a
rough idea of how tight they should be and a reasonably well calibrated
arm.  :)
