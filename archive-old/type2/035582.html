Subject: left side &quot;battery&quot; tray?

Fellow rust warriors,

Has anyone found a vendor in the US that sells the replacement panel for the 
horizontal tray immediately behind the LEFT rear wheel in the late bay 
windows?  Its the equivalent of the right hand side battery tray replacement 
panel that is found in many catalogs.  I have a 74 westphalia.

Alan Schofield in Britian carries it (# 28A platform tray) for 17.00 (+12.00 
if you want it with fitted battery battery clamps for an auxillary battery).  
Has anyone found a vendor here in the states that carries their bay window 
sheet metal?

thanks,
