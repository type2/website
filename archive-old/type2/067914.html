Subject: Aspirations of a baby sitter

The following is an exerp from a message a received from
my mom in Salt lake city, UT.
So mom says:
 
&gt; Not much else new-the gal who cuts my hair and her husband bought a 
&gt; new '97 VW Camper.  The husband is going to Okinawa for 4 years and 
&gt; his wife will join him in June.  I offered to call you to see if you 
&gt; wanted to babysit for the camper while they were awwy for 4 years but 
&gt; found out that his brother is doing the job!!  What a hard thing!! :)
&gt; 
And Chip replies:
&quot;Would have been the best babysitting job I ever had!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;
(to bad it is taken)  :(
