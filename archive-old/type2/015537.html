Subject: Ignition problems again
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi again. I emailed a week ago saying that the first ignition of our
rebuilt 2.0l FI engine resulted in a puff of smoke near the steering
column. The switch was at fault, so we replaced it. Now, the engine cranks
and cranks, but no spark. There seems to be no power to the coil. The
switch again seems to be fried. Does anyone know what could be causing
this? We did have the coil-to-distributor wire grounded because we wanted
to bring up the oil pressure first. Thanks alot,
C.D.
