&gt; &gt; 4. Visually inspected CV boots and they're fine -- didn't check out the

&gt; If the CVs were bad, it would only make the sound when you were
&gt; rolling, right?

Correct

&gt; Check the mount--that big rubber block at the front of the tranny, see what
&gt; that looks like. Also check the little coupler thingy right up there, it's
&gt; like a metal square with a rubber block inside it.

I shoulda thought of this... especially since i had exactly this happend
to me less than a month ago.  Do check all the hangers, especially the
front one.  On a bay, this is a metal block with two bolts thru it. On a
V'gon, it's a plate bolted with 4 bolts.  For both, there is then a rubber
bushing bolted to the trans.  Check that all is secure!
