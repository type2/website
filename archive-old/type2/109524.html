&gt; Did you use a metal insert for the oil breather or the replacement plastic
&gt; part? With a lot of effort I managed to get the plastic one in then it
&gt; cracked open my oil breather hose. I went back to the metal insert and
&gt; clamped the replacement hose.

I used the plastic piece from Bus Boys. The metal one my old boot was a
rusty mess and could have been part of the vacuum leak also. It went into
the boot snug but not hard. The hose did go on very tight but it was a bit
stretched out already. It didn't go on all the way but enough to get a clamp
on it. Just got back from a trip down the Columbia Gorge and she's running
fantastic.
