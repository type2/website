Subject: Re: [T2] Help with crankshaft endplay (it's WAY out)

&gt;  Three shims are required to properly center the crankshaft
&gt;in the main bearing bores. Four shims is out of the range.

So what would happen if I put in five shims ;-)  No, seriously.

I understand the endplay is way out of spec but oil pressure seems good (no 
light at idle, even when hot). Can I squeeze by reducing the endplay to .006 
with five shims? Will I make things worse? If I can stop the leak she'll be 
no worse off than she was. Believe me, I'd rebuild this thing if it were 
mine. I just want to be sure I understand all the options.

Thanks,
Mick
