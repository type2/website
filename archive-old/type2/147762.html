Subject: Re: [T2] 93 Vanagon advice

George-

You don't mention it being a camper, so I'm assuming it's not. From
what I've seen, older Eurovans are going for next to nothing,
especially in the conditon you're describing. Given the reliability
records of older &quot;modern&quot; VWs with lots of electronics and spotty
quality control, I wouldn't touch a rusty '93 auto for any more than
about $2500. And it better be CLEAN for that amount.

If it's a late-production Vanagon, in fact, it's probably worth more.
Most of the '91s I've seen are highly-optioned Carats and GLs, and
even with high miles and assorted bumps and bruises these seem to be
fetching $3k plus. But for $7k I'd expect damn near showroom
condition.

I'd say whichever this car falls under, your son is being taken for
the wrong kind of ride. And please, don't take my word for it, check
out thesamba_dot_com and look at the kind of prices similar vehicles are
fetching nation wide. Good luck and take care-
