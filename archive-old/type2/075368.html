Subject: RE: [T2] Re:  FRAM Oil Filters

&gt; In the last two years, I've taken to dissecting my oil filters,
&gt; particularly on new rebuilders, just to look for metal particles.
&gt; I've sure noticed a wide difference in construction and quality. Some
&gt; (German) filters have over twice as much paper in them as others. Fram is
&gt; one of the worst!  Mann is the best in my book.


The two original-equipment oil filter suppliers are Mann and Mahle. (Not
Bosch, incidentally, who in the U.S. is simply rebadging an aftermarket U.S.
made filter.)   You may not find these OEM oil filters in your local FLAPS,
but you can buy them from me very inexpensively and keep a few on your
shelf.  I charge $3.99 each for the '72-83 (type 4 engine) filter, with a
minimum purchase of 4.  Part number 021 115 351A .
