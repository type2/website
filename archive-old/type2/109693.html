Subject: brake disc screw

Anyone happen to have the size on the two screws that attach the brake rotors to a type 2?
It appears that the PO of my bus stripped one of these things, then removed it with some sort of 'easy out' puller, then proceded to somehow put it back in.  I can't find a match at my local super mega hardware store, so I'm figuring on ordering one (or several just in case) from a specialty place, just don't know the exact size.  Any help is much appreciated.

thanks,
Brian Dann
