Subject: power trip

Just got back from Austin to New Orleans in my 71 westy (1600DP). Generator
light went on in Houston. Belt and crank ok, brushes not making any spark (as
best I could tell when I pushed on what I thought were the brushes based on
hard-to-read Bently diagrams). So with a spare battery and trying to drive
daytime as best I could, I made it back with the 2 batteries (a little nervous
at night running headlights for 90 minutes!). When I did stop, however, I
couldn't (still can't) get it started without push starting. Even when I
installed new battery. This has been an ever increasing occurance for the last
few months, intermittant not starting, just lights on in the dash and thats
it. So here are some questions for the bus gods:
1. Is it worth just changing the brushes on the generator? Or should I just
replace the whole generator? How do I know if it needs just brushes or if the
generator is shot?
2. If I just replace the brushes, should I still change out the voltage
regulator? I know to change it if I need a new generator.
3. Could any of the running on pure battery have damaged my starter? Or is the
starter/ignition trouble be coincidental?  I will eventually do the tests on
the starter from the Type2 library. Just wondering if I should go ahead and
oredr the starter when I order the rest.
4. Could any of this have damaged my coil or any other charging components?

Thanks!
Wink
