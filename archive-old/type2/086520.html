Subject: I passed smog!

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C1E97B.54615A40

I finally took the advice of some of you on the list and went to one of t=
hose don't pass don't pay smog test places to get a printout with the lev=
els on it.
Well, I ended up passing!  (thanks everyone)  I was surprised since the b=
us had been sitting for quite some time.  I knew it was a good sign when =
I pulled up and they were playing Donovan :)  =20
It wasn't going to pass, but the guy adjusted the idle and then the fuel =
injection.
However, now the bus feels like it is going to stall whenever I start it =
or have been sitting at a light.  Then I give it a little gas and it is o=
k.  Does this mean I should adjust the FI?
By the way if anyone lives in the south bay area and needs to know a grea=
t place to go take the smog test let me know.  THey went way out of their=
 way and were really friendly.

Also, I noticed after taking the bus on the highway that the drivers side=
 heater box was smoking.  It was smoking at the end of the box closest to=
 the front, where it connect to the other pipes.  It is all oily.  Is the=
re any way to tell if it is the heater box or a gasket or something?  The=
 bus is burning oil and I think it is related to this.

Does anyone have a manual for a 1979 Westy that they would be willing to =
scan or photocopy for me?  Or does anyone know if the manual is posted an=
ywhere on the internet? =20

Now, if I could only figure out how to install a radio.

Thanks everyone,

Kyle
