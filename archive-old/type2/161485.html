Hi Karl,

That one is a perfect example of why I have a rule to never, ever,  
EVER bid on an auction item listed in ALL CAPS.

- Nasty overspray everywhere, even on engine parts.
- Air vents on the engine lid to let warm exhuast air back into the  
engine compartment
- 1974/75 westfalia seating, in poor condition.
- &quot;Factory Air&quot;... There was no such thing, it was a N/A market  
dealer option.
- Adulterated dash wiring. OTOH, the engine compartment wiring is  
tidied up nicely.

At just over $3K it closed with reserve not met.

In the local market that bus would probably fetch about $5-6K if the  
seller could prove the engine was as fresh as advertised.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
