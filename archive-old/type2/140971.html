Subject: Shifting

Just to add to this discussion, albeit late; when I was line driving &quot;big 
wheels&quot;, you put your FINGERS on the shifter, and &quot;felt&quot; the correct time to 
move it, gently, since &quot;it&quot; knew where to go, and just needed time, not 
direction by force, the same way I drive my Westy. That to me is more Zen, 
and you lock out everything else.  The other point, is that in the mountains 
around here, (Vancouver Island), I have found that the 3rd gear will operate 
from 7kmh to 50, and is astonishingly flexible!  Love that kind of 
Engineering &quot;forgiveness&quot;!
