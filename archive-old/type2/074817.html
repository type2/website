Subject: Belly Pans


Big bunch of controversy here, I don't know of the definitive answer but 
lets just say some had them, some didn't and they only really serve to keep 
the underfloor clean.

New ones are available from Just Kampers here in the UK or Schofield, also 
in the UK.

I fitted a complete new set to my bus Spooky and some images can be seen on 
my site www.specialpatrolgroup.co_dot_uk probably in the nearside sills replace 
area.

I like em, they keep some roadnoise down and look nice.

I would *really* like to know why and why not with regards to these things 
as the question repeats itself every few months, any of you guru's out there 
know the *definitive* answer???

Mike
