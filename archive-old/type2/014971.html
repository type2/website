&gt;Conventional wisdom says that &quot;helper springs&quot; transfer a significant load to
&gt;the shock mounts which were NEVER designed to be a load carrying structure. 
&gt;Resetting the torsion bars is the only way to fix the problem without adding
&gt;more problems down the road.  

I must respectfully disagree based on my personal experience of 3 years and
30,000+ miles using the Napa shocks I mentioned in the earlier post.  That
30K miles includes many miles of Mexican backroads, cobblestone streets, as
well as East Texas potholes.

While I would never argue with the assertion the shock mounts which were
not designed to be a load carrying structure, the additional load they
carry from the coil-over shocks would seem to be within limitations, based
on my actual experience.

Here is how to solve the question:  How many list members have successfully
used the coil-over shocks, and how many have experienced unsuccessful
outcomes?  Only those with actual first-hand experience should respond.
