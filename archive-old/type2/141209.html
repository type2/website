Subject: Re: [T2] Total advance 3500rpm

There's nothing wrong with 45 degrees of timing, under the right
circumstances. The &quot;limit&quot; of 30 degrees is WOT, which is done with no vac
advance since you don't get vac advance over 1/2 throttle in the first
place.

Under anything less then WOT conditions the engine NEEDS more advance, which
is why 009s can't compare to SVDAs on the road.
