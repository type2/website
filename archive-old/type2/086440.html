Subject: will it go faster this way?

------=_NextPart_001_0001_01C1E784.21473A60

Hey everyone!   Happy Friday!!!

Time for Fridays crazy question...
Why is it that when you see someone driving a bus down the highway at ful=
l speed,  they are always leaning so far forward that their head is almos=
t hitting the windshield?  When I used to drive my 67 deluxe down the hig=
hway in California, I found myself doing the same thing!  Surely the seat=
 is far enough forward in a bus to be able to &quot;sit back and enjoy the rid=
e.&quot;  I think bus owners deep down inside believe that if you lean far eno=
ugh forward, your own body weight will somehow make you go faster!  Try t=
his theory out on the highway sometime.  When you find yourself starting =
to lean, are you saying &quot;Come on Bessie, you can do it!&quot;? Once again, que=
stions, comments and stories welcome.
