Subject: VW special tool list needed

I have made contact with a guy that years ago used to run a  repairshop
specialising in Volkswagen.
During that time he supposedly bought out the specialty tool inventories
of some of the dealers that closed down over the years.
When he closed shop himself he kept the tools and they are now for sale.
Supposedly there are a whole lot of tools, but mostly transmission
related. So I suspect others had their pick, as tranny tools are always
the last to go.
I will meet with him in a few weeks to survey the inventory. There is
supposed to be A LOT.  He also can not identify many of the tools.
As I have had the tool identification problem before I wonder if anyone
owns or has ever seen a VW special tool list? I don't mean the other
aftermarket tools, but the VW distributed ones from mostly MATRA,
Peiseler, Hunger and such.
Any help is appreaciated.

Also I am willing shell out serious money for the VAG 1551 gizmo. So if
you can steal one offer it to me! :)                       just kidding
