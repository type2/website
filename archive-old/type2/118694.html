Subject: dizzy FART was: 009's

Hi all,

OK vacuum can preachers, I want to see the light.  My 009 setup has turned
into Day of the Living Flat Spot.  I have a newly reborn 1835 Type 1 with DRLA
36's.  Nice on the highway 800 miles this weekend with the new 091 but hell in
town. Plus the timing of this nearly-new 009 is jumping all over the place.

Questions:

1.  I would consider an SVDA but I have heard that it is not *necessarily*
good for modified engines.  Well there I am.  Does anyone know what vacuum
signal it is looking for.

2.  I have a 205 E dual vac, any chance that would work at all?

3. any other suggestions, has anyone ever used vacuum distributors with
Dellorto DRLAs on a Type 1?

Basically all I hear is that with modified engines, all bets are off.  I don't
have the bucks for one of those Mallorys.

Thanks,
Will Anderson
Smyrna, GA
