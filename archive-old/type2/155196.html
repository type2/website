Hi All, 

Wow.  I would expect the thrust bearings in the crank to beat themselves
into oblivion in short order.  Then again, the T4 is about as tough as
boiled owl.  

Does the VW engine have any oiling problems under negative gee
situations?  Are they using fuel injection or carbs?  Anything special
they're doing to the carbs to prevent icing?  What about compression
ratio, hp/torque output?  

What fuel is being used, and what's the consumption rate?  What's the
overhaul schedule?

Thanks!

Shad H.

&gt; The January 2007 edition of Air &amp; Space magazine has a great article on home
&gt; built Tplanes (under$10,000) with VW engines.  One has a 1.9 that can cruise
&gt; 400 miles at 130 mph.  Cool pics of the engine with the heads and pushrod
&gt; tubes visible.
&gt; 
&gt; The editor of &quot;Contact&quot; magazine is quoted:  &quot;..the VW conversion engine
&gt; seems to be the best bang for the buck, mostly because it can go direct
&gt; drive.&quot;  -the propeller is bolted directly to the crankshaft at turns at the
&gt; engines RPM.
