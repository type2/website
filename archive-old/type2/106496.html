&gt;
&gt; right but since the gauges are not syncronized with the changes they are
&gt; behaviing differently  the speedo still thinks it has 185/14 tires while
&gt; the engine knows differently

The VW mechanic's pocket bible (Without Guesswork) from 1970 lists the 185R14 tires for the passenger Busses but still lists a taller bias ply tire for the working class vehicles. When I researched the tire issue I found that the diameters of these 2 tires are significantly different. But the speedos are the same. So, until VW changed the speedos (I have
no idea what year that might have been), any Bus with 185R14s on it would read wrong. The radial size closest to the original bias tires is a 205/75 14.
