Well, I'm back on the Type II list again.  Had too many 
messages returned on the old Juno account.  After you have 
a few hundred messages Juno doesn't like to work too well.

But, I'm back now and have a request for help.  I put the 
engine back in the '72 Westy and got it started Friday 
evening.  It lasted about five minutes.  The first couple 
of minutes went smooth, then I heard what sounded like 
someone hitting the engine with a hammer.  Before I got to 
the ingition to turn it off, it died.  It gets worse.  
After it died I could hear the flywheel still spinning.  I 
don't know what the condition of everything is at that end 
of the crankshaft but at the other end one of the bolts 
that hold the fan on worked out and the other two snapped 
off.

Looks like I'm &quot;back to the drawing board&quot;.  Any ideas of 
what I could have done wrong?

This is a stock 1700 (was locked up) that I took out of a 
'73 bus.
