Subject: Re: [T2] Larger Tires for more speed? 

Well, you won't get more power, or necessarily better handling. The fact
that the tires are newer, and if you get nicer compounds you'll have better
handling. Larger tires effectively gives you a higher gear ratio (or lower,
or whatever the proper term is). It basically means that your top-speed will
be increased. It will take LESS engine RPMS to maintain a speed that you
were currently at.

It will however give you slower acceleration. Higher top-speed, for slower
acceleration.

This is rather nice though because it will improve your fuel economy, and
give you better high-way cruising speeds.

One of the other side effects is that it will increase the height of your
bus, which can hurt the handling, and increase the chances of it tipping
over under emergency maneuvers.

If you get wider and taller tires, that'll help the handling, but it may
reduce your fuel economy (or keep it unchanged) due to the increase drag
from teh road.

&gt; I read on some site somewhere that if you put on like 255's instead of our
&gt; 195's that you'll get higher top speeds, better mileage, and improved
&gt; handling. Is their any truth to that? My bus has plenty of power to spare.
&gt; Vroom vroom, but in 4th on the freeway doing 60mph gets my RPM's WAY high.
And
&gt; starting out in 1st takes hardly any gas at all, and only takes me to like
&gt; 10mph. I can easily start out in 2nd, even up minor hills, but I fear
that's
&gt; bad for the tranny.
