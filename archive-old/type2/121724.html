Subject: Re: [T2] Bad hydraulic lifters (rant)

Okay, so if a rock hard lifter is good and I have 1 rock hard one and
7 compressible ones, does that mean that I have 7 bad ones and one
good one versus 1 bad one and 7 good ones? :-)

Seriously though, hydraulic lifters are supposed to pump up and bleed
down. Otherwise, they would be no different from solid lifters. A rock
hard hydraulic lifter that DOES NOT bleed down will run in your engine
like a solid lifter with zero lash. Not good.

As to changing lifters without changing the cam, yes, that can be
done. Most engine rebuild manuals talk about checking the lifters and
putting in new ones if necessary with the proper application of moly
lube. You would have to break in the engine like a new one : 20-30
minutes of high/varying rpm running. If you don't to that, you'll
probably destroy the cam. It is reusing the old lifters that is tricky
i.e. you need to put back the lifters in the same bores you took them
out from. Of course, the question here is whether reground cams would
work out well. AVP regrinds their cams, which may not be compatible
with the new lifters. We'll see.

Regarding adjusting the lifters, the hydraulic valves on this motor
were adjusted by a VW shop in consultation with Leonard of AVP at
about 300-500 miles (can't remember exactly when). Subsequently, I
brought in the vehicle for an additional adjustment at about 1000
miles which was also recommended by the shop, again in consultation
with AVP.
