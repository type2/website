&gt; What about the flexy hoses? if they don't swell when
&gt; the brakes are pressed, should those be replaced as a
&gt; precaution as well?


The cautious among us on the list think that a full brake overhaul is 
the first order of business on a bus. Nothing else is as important.

It's brakes first, fuel lines second, steering third, engine fourth, 
and everything else can follow.

You don't say how much time you have, though. This is not a job to rush 
into. If you have to make half-way measures, make sure that your 
emergency brake cables are competent and adjusted. Then practice 
getting your hand on the brake handle without thinking, in case you 
need to.
