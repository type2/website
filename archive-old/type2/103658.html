Subject: Need wiring harness install help

I have to replace the wiring harness and at least the metal tube that the
wire goes thru from front to back (underneath and in center of bus).  This
is for a 71 SC.  I have already purchased the new Wiring harness from Wiring
Works out of CA.  &lt;Nice :) &gt;  My question is what would be the best and
easiest thing to replace the metal tube?  This truck is not and never will
be a show truck.  I am going to use it for what it is for, a truck.  I do
not have a welder and the SC will not be drivable until the wiring harness
is in place.

Also what would be the best strategy for replacing the wires?  start at back
or front? Pull off a wire at a time and replace?

Also don't know if will matter yet or not.  But I have the wiring harness
for a 71 bus, the front end of my SC has been replaced with a 73 and up
front end with the later turn signals also.  Will this cause major problems?

Any help would be appreciated, as I am lost at electricals....

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
