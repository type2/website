Well, let's think back to the time and place when our buses were conceived.
Europe in the mid sixties. I was a teenager back then. On the block I lived
in (10 middle class families) there were 4 cars. The most popular car on the
roads were 1200 cc beetles.

When I got my drivers license a couple of years later there still was no
general speed limit outside of city limits. If you wanted to drive at speeds
of over 100 mph nobody would stop you. BUT, an average family saloon would
have maybe 40 to 50 hp. The roads were not all that good and speeds of 80
mph were regarded as break-neck speeds. In those days our 50 hp buses were
not regarded as 'moving roadblocks'

In the eighties the average car became more powerful and many were able to
attain speeds of close to 125 mph. At the same time speed limits were
introduced. As a driver you now faced a dilemma. You car could go much
faster but you aren't allowed to. That creates stress. Even more when the
roads fill up and traffic comes to a crawl.

So what did I do? Two years ago I got rid of my shiny fast new car and
bought myself a couple of buses.   My daily driver is a 1600 cc Vanagon
diesel (no turbo!). It's top speed 60 Mph. Even my 1600 bay is faster.
However in nowadays European traffic that does not pose a problem at all.
Mind you, Holland is a very flat country (the only 'hill' in the area is a
7% incline for about half a mile). I can assure you that driving this way is
much more relaxed. Yes, occasionally you'll have fast cars behind you. But
then think about how much the insurance of that BMW or Merc will cost the
owner. That's the equivalence of a major engine overhaul  every year!
Peace......
