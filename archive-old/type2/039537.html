Subject: New---Help!!! bus won't move forward!!!

Hello all:
   here are the new happenings with my bus, this morning i went to start it
and it turned over and ran in forwards and reverse but it was struggling to
stay alive even in neutral, could this be something to do with the carbs???
being that i could shift it now??? this whole thing still has me scratching
my head.....
thanks in advance
