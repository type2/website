Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Rebuild Question

Chris,

I have always replaced pistons and cylinders as a group.

Stock pistons and cylinders are made in a matched pairs.

T4 engines are more expensive to do this on than a bug engine,
but the benefits are there.  All new parts essentially and no worries 
about whether they fit right or match or that the tolerances are good.

Others will tell you you can replace parts, but to me, it's just not worth 
it.  If I am going to spend the labor time to do it, then I want it to 
last as long as possible without the labor again.

The procedures for honing cylinders and deglazing them are precise and 
time consuming.  Plus new rings, plus making sure that the ring lands on 
the pistons are not worn, the wrist pins are not worn, cleaning the 
pistons enough to *know* they are right.  Setting the rings on the pistons
and regaping them to know that they are matched to factory 
tolerances....it goes on and on.

Just my 2 cents.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I've been slowly working on an engine rebuild (my first) and have a
&gt; question about replacing pistons. I read that if I am going to replace
 the pistons that I should also replace the cylinders as well. I this
 true? I know that my rings were bad and I was burning oil but I don't
 really detect any scratches or the like on the cylinder walls (ie.
 evidence of seizing). There is however a bit of burnt oil residue
&gt; towards the top of each cylinder. Is it just a standard procedure to
&gt; replace everything? Can anyone give me the skinny on this?
