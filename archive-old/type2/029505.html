&gt; Actually, Mr. Lyle will probably need to make several measurements: there
&gt; should be *negative gradients* extending from the various boudaries with
&gt; still air to the fan (lowest pressure).  Pressure will decrease (per
&gt; Bournoulli's law) in areas where air flows faster. (example: the pressure
&gt; between the sparetire bulge and the body will be 0, but between the fan
&gt; housing and the firewall will be lower. (assuming an upright engine)).
 
You folks make it too difficult!  The only thing that matters is the
pressure differential between the outside and the inside of the engine
bay.  Local effects will be present, but they will be there no matter what
the pressure differential is.

Perhaps I'll make it easier still, and just measure the absolute pressure
in the engine bay at various operating conditions.  With engine off,
engine idling, engine revved, and moving with engine revved.  That way we
can sort out the cause of each change.

i suppose a thermocouple should go in there too, since the instrumentation
interface has to be hooked up anyway.

&gt; (Of course there's a positive gradient from the center of the fan to its
&gt; circumference, but if George can devise an experiment to measure it he'll be
&gt; able to take his place along side Franklin, Michleson/Morley, Ruthford and
&gt; Millikan. :) )

Or perhaps Pons and Fleischmann :)
