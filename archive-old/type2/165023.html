Subject: Re: [T2] Sink only works with the key on

2 years ago it worked with the key off, then only sometimes, now the key always needs to be turned on, I was hoping for a very specific response from somebody that has had the exact same issue, thanks

&gt; It's wired through ignition. It needs to be wired directly to battery. 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; Can somebody tell a person short on time why his sink only works with the 
&gt; &gt; key on? Please?
