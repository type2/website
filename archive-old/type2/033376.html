&quot;Jerry from Busdepot wrote to me after i asked about a cam for my 74 1800:

&gt; Clark,  The cam is $xx.xx, rebuilt, you can specify
&gt; some of the grind specs,
&gt; 
&gt; Jerry  &gt; 
 
List,
Should i specify any grind specs?  Anybody running a 'hot' cam in an otherwise
stock solid-lift type4 or have info you might share?

thanks,
clark gordon
