Travis,

My wife and I and our former bus ('69 Westy - we now have a 77 Westy)
took a trip from Minnesota to the southern tip of Baja in Feb/March of
1995. We had a great trip. No problems of any kind. We did lots of
non-Hiway 1 travel and would recommend it, since that's where all of the
fun is. We loved camping right ON the ocean. Neither of us speak Spanish
very well. Being fluid in Spanish would have greatly enhanced our trip.
We new enough Spanish to ask questions, but understanding the response
and having real conversations was out. The myth that most 'younger'
Mexicans speak English is a NOT true. Even the border gaurd at Algodones
didn't speak any English. In Cabo many people spoke English.

Lots of Bugs and Busses in Mexico. Since my 69 had a Type I engine, I
didn't worry too much about breakdowns, since any bug engine would fit.
I did bring my complete set of tools, spare wheel bearing of each kind,
brake slave cylinder rebuild kit for front/back, brake fluid, 5 GOOD
tires. I checked everything before I left and had oil changed every
2-3000 miles.

I wouldn't be as comfortable in my '77 since any fuel injection part
that went out may be difficult/ impossible to find. They do still make
busses, and so the new engines may fit in 75-79 busses, but I'm not
sure. 

This may sound silly, but I would bring a carb of some sort and pre-plan
a way to cludge it into the existing intake stuff. Don't forget fuel
hose and an electric low pressure fuel pump for the carb. 

Best of Luck,

TBone
