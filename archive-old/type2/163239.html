Subject: Re: [T2] Front beam ?

I'm taking the front beam off a donor bus (rear was crushed by a tree 
limb...;-(
I'd like to utilize the entire assembly. Question: I've got a heavy duty two 
arm
puller on the pitman arm/drag link connection but it's got a &quot;lot&quot; of tension 
on
it...Can/should I use it to disconnect this fitting or should I go further 
back and
pull the pitman arm off the steering box...
