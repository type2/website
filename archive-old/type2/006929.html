Howdy-Hi Volks. Just bought an '80 Vanagon after having to tow it home
(no gear shifting) bled clutch with good results with all gears but 4th,
only grinding there. Tried to adjust shift rod per Bentley, now will not
shift out of what I belive to be 3rd.Question,finally, does this sound
like an adjustment prob or possibly something deeper in the trans like
selector shaft wear? It has an 091 4 speed trans and 2.0L air cooled
engine. Halp! Would like to get this buttoned up before winter makes
its' much rumored appearance around here (mid-Mich) Thanks in any case!
