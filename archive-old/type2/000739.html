 I've just had the HE's off for welding, and whilst
putting everything back I ran the engine with the bottom tin off, and with
the risers at the downstream end of the HE's not connected.

There's a good strong draught blowing downwards from the top side of the
engine, but the airflow through the HE's is quite poor, and it's worst on
the right hand side. It's not leaking through the duct from the electric
fan, though there are minor leaks from the HE tin round the exhaust pipes.
Also the small flaps on the inlets to the HE's seem to work OK.

Is this normal and is there a fix? It seems to me that the heater would be a
lot warmer if I could actually feel some air flow through at the cab end.
Instead there's only a really feeble light breeze.


It's a 79 2 litre type 4 engine BTW.
