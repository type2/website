Hey there Guys and Gals,

First off, a HUGE thanks to all who responded!

Well, ended up I had a short.  

I checked and cleaned all the connections I could follow to the coil and
battery and also checked the connections to the ignition switch as many of you
had recommended.  Finally, got juice to the coil!  Whooopeeeeeee! : ) Thanked
the gods at this point as  I don't havta replace that ignition switch.  Still
wasn't gettin spark from the coil wire though :(   

After much checking (and I mean MUCH)  ended up the points were fried at some
point  (Maybe when my buddy tried jumpin her to move her outta the drive).  I
filed the points and reset the timing ta see if I could get her started to no
avail. Was getting spark at the plugs now though : ) 

I'm gonna order that tune-up package from Ron and order some new wires too I
think.  I'll be in the process of moving back to OKC this month so won't get
to work on Eve till Sep.  Bummer, as I was hoping to have her running b4 my
return.  

Big thanks to all again and gotta luv the list!

Later man,

Don (SkyCruizer)
