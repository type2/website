 Hello all.....I'm new to the list. I live in Airdrie, AB.
Canada, just minutes north of Calgary, AB(World Famous
Calgary Stampede). About 1.5 hour drive from Banff, Lake
Louise and the Beautiful Rocky Mountains. Currently own an
'84 Wolfsburg Westfalia, '81 Rabbit convertible and, ummm,
ahhhhhhh, '87(twitch), errrrrr, Dodge(shudder), ahhhhh, Mini
Van. It's my work Van.......Honest!!!!!
 
 Just got back from looking at a '79 Type 2 Cargo Van. Have
had nothing to do with Air Cooled Vans before. Lot's of
Bugs, but no Vans.
 Went to Bus Depots page to get some tips as to what to
watch out for in a '79, also searched the Library and the
Archives. Now that I've had a look at all of them I have a
few questions!
 PO says it has'nt been run in 5 years. He tried to start it
awhile ago and says it would only run *on starting fluid and
WD-40*???????? What's up with that? Fuel Pump?
 It appears to have a fair bit of surface rust, but, no
perforations yet. The VW Emblem is gone from the front (of
course), and it has not been butchered in any way other than
a set of giant driving lights bolted to the front bumper.
 The things the Bus Depot page says to look out for appear
to not be too bad.
 The engine turns over fine, so, I hope that the *starting
fluid and WD-40* have not done any damage(washing the
cylinder walls of oil, etc.). The oil level is to the top
line on the dipstick, but is very thick and very black.
 Suggestions and Comments, Hints, Tips and Ideas on
purchasing and/or troubleshooting as well as what to look
out for, are requested and would be greatly appreciated.
Subscribed to the list just a few hours ago, so reply's can
be sent to me directly!!!!!!!!
 What is the proper term to call this Van? Breadloaf? Bay?
Transporter? Cargo Van? T2?
 There are 234,000 km. on the odometer.
 Oh yeah, the price on the Van is $1200.00 O.B.O. Canadian

 TIA
