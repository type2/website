Subject: [T2] Starter problem

&gt; I have a 72 bus and the power all works in it put when I turn the key
&gt; the final turn to start it nothing happens.  I think its an electrical
&gt; problem. It's a fairly new starter (6 months old) so I don't think its
&gt; that.  Is there a main wire that I should check? Or anthing else that
&gt; could be doing this?

You probably have a poor connection somewhere in the starter switch
circuit or in the wiring to and from your starter relay.

In a stock bus wiring setup, the wire from ignition switch goes directly
to the solenoid terminal on the starter. That's a long wire and it tends
to get more resistance over time, often to the point where it doesn't
start reliably. There's also the well documented problem with hot engines
heating up the starter and making for more resistance in wires so buses
don't start reliably when they are hot.  To improve this situation, most
buses have an aftermarket starter relay installed. In this case, the wire
from the ignition switch goes to the starter relay (a little cylindrical
doodad usually mounted near the battery), usually via a spadefoot
connector somewhere near the starter. There will also be a wire from the
positive battery terminal to the starter relay and another connection from
the relay to the starter solenoid.

I went through this all last year and eventually found that the spadefoot
connector that extends the wire from the ignition switch (that used to go
to the starter) all the way to the starter relay (mounted a few feet
further back, by the battery) was old, melted, and unreliable. It was
hiding up above my starter, out of sight. Replacing that connection put me
back in reliable starting.

If this connection is flakey, then the bus won't start even if the starter
relay and the starter and the battery are good. But it will start if you
manually connect the hot terminal on the starter relay with the activating
terminal on the starter relay (bypassing the ignition switch circuit).

In my case, this connection apparently worked sometimes. I thought I had a
flakey solenoid on the starter becuase banging on the solenoid usually got
me started again. Apparently that connection got jolted enough from me
banging on the starter next to it to temporarily restore function. i
pulled my starter 2x and got temporarily stranded in several inconvenient
parking lots before I figured this out.

Other wires to check include:
battery terminals
the big cable from positive battery terminal to the starter (both ends)
wires to and from the starter relay
ignition switch and that long wire from it to the starter relay

Good luck,
