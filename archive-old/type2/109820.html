Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust install help!

Hiya Courtney,

Yeah, replacing the exhaust system can a be a bit of an experience.  But with 
some patience practically anything, including redoing the exhaust on a 1970 
Bus is possible.

First thing to know is that more often than not the pieces will not line up 
in order to make installation easy.  In other words, definitely not like the 
pictures in the manuals.  Even with good quality parts (like Leistritz (sp?)) 
things may be off just a bit.  So...........a good idea is to piece everything 
together without doing any tightening of fasteners.  Just slide pieces 
together, assemble the clamps, and run the nuts in a couple a turns - just to get them 
started - no tighter.  This will give you a bunch of play (should you need 
it) at other contact points.  I've always found that the toughest &quot;fits&quot; were 
the heat riser tubes up in the engine compartment.

The bar you refer to is the rear engine mount.  Commonly called the moustache 
bar due to its shape.  You really don't want to mess with this part unless 
you are looking at removing the engine entirely.  It provides critical support 
for the engine-transaxle assembly.  Removing it would require you to support 
the engine-transaxle in some other way.  Installing the exhaust can be done with 
the moustache bar in place - trust me on that one.

You don't mention this, but if you have not already, I'd suggest taking off 
your heat exchangers at this point.  This is a great opportunity to check 'em 
out for cleaning and repair.  And again, the system will be easier to install 
if there is some &quot;play&quot; in the heat exchangers.  So put them onloosely.  Also a 
good time to clean the threads on the mounting studs or replace if needed.

Some on The List may suggest &quot;customizing&quot; the joint between the heat 
exchangers and the muffler.  There are some very good ideas for this process.  
Flanges and little welding at this point can do wonders.  However, if you decide not 
go that route, you might want to consider the following.  When you assemble 
the exhaust donut and its clamp you might want to smear some muffler cement in 
and around that joint.  If there is a &quot;weak spot&quot; in the exhaust system, this 
is it.  The addition of the cement helps to seal that joint positively.
