&gt; This is a reminder about the carabus heading from Northwestern New York
&gt; state down to Harper's Ferry West Virginia for John Brown's Buses on
&gt; Friday October 15th, 2004.

from someone who travels much of that route frequently

&gt; 9:45 AM  -Turn Left and head south on I79

you could stay on I79 south to I68 travel East to Hancock MD where it
joins up with I70.   hills are about the same either way but I79/68 is
much better road.  several good restaurants and gas stations in Cumberland
and is easy off/on

&gt; 11:30AM - Take exit 228 turning East onto 70/76 to pick up the Penna
&gt; Turnpike. There'll be a fuel stop somewhere in the next hour or so,
&gt; which will also be used for a brief meal break. I can't vouch for the
&gt; quality of the restaurants on the penna turnpike, I plan to bring a
&gt; cooler with a brown bag lunch already packed.

but if you insist on taking the Pa turnpike I recommend the &quot;MIDWAY&quot; rest
area probably has the best food, gas prices are about the same at all rest
areas.  and this one is the cleanest too.  such that it is.   or even
Better yet go on thru to BREEZEWOOD the town of motels, LOTS and LOTS of
choices for food and fuel and a lot cheaper

&gt;
&gt; 2:00 PM - Exit #161 takes us off the Penna Turnpike at Breezewood,
&gt; continue south on I-70. Be prepared to pay the tolls.
&gt;
&gt; 2:45 PM - Head East on I-68
that would be East on I-70,   I-68 ends at I-70

&gt; 3:30 PM Head South on I-81 to exit the interstate at Martinsburg. From
&gt; there we travel on secondary roads about 15 minutes to Harpers Ferry.

considerably longer than 15 minutes and the roads are very confusing. my
suggestion would be to continue on I-70 to Frederick Md and exit South on
route 340/route 15
  Stay on route 340 when it splits, you will cross the Potomac and then
the Shanandoah rivers at Harpers ferry climb the hill and turn left at the
top into the camp ground

couple miles longer but probably faster and certainly if you don't know
the local roads much less likely to get lost...

hope to see you there, have a great trip.  check your brakes some of the
grades are LONG and steep


&gt; Speeds in this group will average at about 55-60 MPH. There are some
&gt; VERY long hills on the Penna Turnpike and on I-70 south of Breezewood,
&gt; and I don't want to damage anyone's engine. I have a CHT gauge in my

that has to qualify as the understatement of the East. (keep quiet you
left coasters)

&gt; If anyone has information about road conditions or route suggestions
&gt; I'd be very happy to hear about them. I haven't driven this route since
&gt; returning from EveryBus in April.

Bob
