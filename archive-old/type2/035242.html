That's disappointing to hear.

I purchased a set of their heads about four years ago and paid the core
because I didn't have anything to send back. The heads were good and worked
as expected. I too inspected to the best of my ability, at that time, but
found no noticable fault.

I was satisfied enough to shell out the cash to purchase a Stage I motor
from them. I never intended to send them the core because I wanted an engine
to work on. Since I never returned a core I don't have any experience from
that side of the coin. I am however very happy with the product I purchased
and the advice I received from them.

That's my .02

79 Transporter, MSHP Stage I, AT, FI


&gt;&gt;But be aware that even Marc Stephens isn't perfect. David Schwarze and I
&gt;&gt;have both gotten unsatisfactory heads from MSHP. Inspect thoroughly!
&gt;
&gt;I too got two bad heads from them.
&gt;And, as I do not tire to point out, MSHP will routinely cheat you
&gt;out of your core
&gt;charge.
&gt;They do this with such impertinence and efficiency that it is disgusting.
&gt;They still owe me $200 and I still get mad just thinking of them.
