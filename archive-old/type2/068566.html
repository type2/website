Subject: Administrative droning, PLEASE READ

Here are the changes to the charter. We aren't doing anything too radical
here but I think (hope) it will make a substantial difference.

- --Type2 is about being in busses on the road, keeping busses on the road,
and getting neglected or forlorn busses back on the road, because that is
where they should be. The noblest thing you can do here is to help a fellow
listee get a broken bus rolling. There are other considerations, but all of
them are secondary.

- --This list has a very friendly, loose style and messages tend to be laced
with humor. We have a helluva lot of fun here and we hope you will, too.
But please DO NOT conclude from this that the list is a chat session--it
isn't. When you post a message, that message is sent to hundreds of people
all over the world and it's rude to waste their time.

If you post frivolous or off-topic messages, I'll probably speak to you by
pmail and I may intercept your messages and look them over before they're
posted. If you continue, you'll find your subscription cancelled.

- --The preferred way to reply to a list message is by private email. Unless
your reply is of genuine list-wide importance, don't post it to the public
list. This is a question of substance, it's a judgement call, and it
belongs to you. Please consider carefully whether everybody on the list
might be profited by your reply. If you're answering a mechanical question,
it's probably good to post it publicly. If you're adding your two cents to
a thread that's not too important to begin with, or making a wisecrack, do
it by pmail.

- --Quote only for context. Do not quote entire messages and add a reply,
this is annoying. If you quote somebdy else's message including his
signature in order to add a wisecrack to the bottom, you're going to be
hearing from me.

- --Friday. The concept of list-wide TGIF originated (to my knowledge) on the
Vanagon list, which is our sister list, and since it makes sense we filched
it. ;) Friday is intended to be a release valve and morale-builder; things
are looser on that day. As of November, 1996, because of increasingly heavy
mail load, several topics that are arguably bus-related but are fairly
trivial were moved to Friday-only status.

It is imperative that you understand that Friday ends at midnight on that
day, it does not endure indefinitely. Come Saturday, we have to stop even
if we don't really want to. Do not post messages on these topics on any
other day.

Topics that are appropriate only on Friday include:

TOYS AND MEMORABILIA - Many listees collect toy busses and some are
interested in old VW advertisements and owner's manuals and dealer
literature and such.

VW ESOTERICA - Accounts of peculiar or amazing feats involving VWs. There
seem to be no end to these stories. This category includes accounts of the
origins of the bus, which come up every few months.

SURVEYS - Perennial favorites among some and irritating nuisances to
others, these are the &quot;what if?&quot; fantasy threads. &quot;What bus would you like
to be stranded with on a desert island?&quot;

SIGHTINGS - Spotting a bus in some medium and reporting it to the list.
This usually involves noting a bus in a television show or commercial and
becoming very excited. Frankly I think some of you need to get out more.

BUSWEAR - Please confine discussion of Mr. Palmer's popular line of bus
fashions and accessories to Friday.

HUMOR - Can vary widely, you'll know it when you see it. Has included some
sublime stuff including song lyrics and epic poetry. Humor MUST HAVE BUS
CONTENT, if it doesn't then don't post it no matter how funny it is. Please
do not drag over generic automotive humor that circulates among automotive
lists and newsgroups, and please do not crudely splice feeble bus content
into generic automotive humor articles--this never fools anybody.

- --People on the list often put together gatherings. It is appropriate to
post an announcement if you are planning an event; after that you need to
put together your own small mailing list. Do not do trip planning on the
list.

With regard to the CCC list: Martha &lt;busgirl_at_netcom_dot_com&gt; maintains a list
of people she knows to be interested in California Camping Crazies events.
Because of the way this list is handled, messages to it tend to try to post
themselves to the type2 and v_at_l lists unless people are very careful with
their headers, and often they aren't.

Please edit type2 out of your header when posting messages to the CCC list.
Trip planning can get very trivial and dull if you are one of the 900+
people who aren't going to be able to be there, and you can't expect those
people to be interested in things like menu planning and pleas for
sufficient toilet paper.

Post-event trip reports are welcome anytime.

- --Discussion of Beetles, Ghias, 41Xs, and such is not topical. There are
other lists for all of these.

- --Ken
