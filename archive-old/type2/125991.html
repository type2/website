&gt; 1st question is......... do I take the wire intended for the 12.7S

&gt; &quot;directly&quot; to the positive terminal on battery??


Yes, using the #12 awg wire and I reccomend you sleeve it.. ie: put a loom over it. Use that
spagetti tube from a north american vehicle or a real high temp loom if you can get it,, or some
heat shrink tube, just something to give it extra protection from scuffing ,,, look at the wire
from the alt to the starter for an example of what I mean.

&gt;
&gt; While in the archives I came across refernces that I needed to incorperate
&gt; this into the coil.
&gt; Where does this come in??   (on the diagram, contact #30 goes to positive
&gt; terminal on the main battery.......  and contact #86 seems to go no-where?


#86 goes to the blue wire at the voltage regulator,, or you can connect it to coil main power
terminal #1,, but that will allow the relay to connect the batteries any time the key is on.
the blue wire connection will close the relay when the alternator is starting to make voltage,,
after the engine is started, so there is much less current flow in all circuits


&gt; does anyone know if contact #30 or #86 is where I go to the coil?
&gt;


To recap
#30 goes to main battery positive terminal,, put loom over this wire to be most correct
#87 goes to the Aux battery positive terminal  .. put loom over this wire to be most correct
#86 goes to Voltage regulator Blue wire,, or coil terminal 1
#85 goes to ground

You can eliminate the fuse in that relay,, it isn't necessary... if the circuit does
overload....the relay contacts inside will only hold about 80 amps,, the wire will not start to
get red hot until about 100amps.
That is what the loom is for,, if there is a problem, the wire will get hot, the loom stops the
wire from shorting to ground,, and the relay contacts will go POOF,, opening the fault.
The #12 wire impedance will limit the amount of fault current anyways,,,

So you protected without the annoying fuse blowing frequently when you aux battery is low.
That current only flows for a few minutes then the lead acid taper charge comes into effect and
the voltage rises, the current drops off,,
But if the fuse blows then you have a dead aux battery,,,
you don't need that fuse,,
YMMV
