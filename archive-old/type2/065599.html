Subject: Re: Seneca Rocks Camping Trip - Directions

Steve Dolan's directions are excellent, but I want to warn people about
I-66 outside the DC beltway. There is extensive contruction in the
outbound lanes, and the last time I took it four lanes at the beltway
ultimately narrowed down to one around Manassas. Incredible delays,
particularly during evening rush hours.

If you consider this is an opportunity to mellow out and listen to
another coupla Dead tapes, no problema. If you are more like the hyper
Washingtonian determined to get out of town as soon as possible and
think the good times don't start until you can cruise at 55MPH without a
worry, take a breath, consult your map and consider alternatives. 

The worst part is from Centerville to Manassas.
