Volks:

I probably didn't give enough information in my previous post.  I double
checked all the engine stuff people suggested, like timing, and vacuum
(just disconnected the brake booster).  So  here's what happens. Crank
engine and shift to reverse.  Release clutch and it moves O.k.  Stick it
in first, and the gear seems to be too high.  I got out on the road
again.  I have to rev the engine and feather the clutch in order to get
rolling.  Now, here comes the wierd part. No noticeable drag when clutch
is disengaged.  When the clutch is released, the engine can barely
overcome it.  BUT, If I stop and go in reverse some distance, it gets
somewhat better.  I did get to 3rd today, but even with the pedal on the
floor, it wouldn't accelerate any more.  None of the wheels were warm to
the touch. So, I came home, jacked up the back end of the bus and ran
the engine with the transmission in 2nd.  When it reaches a certain rpm
~1500-2000, i can hear a growling noise.  But I can't tell where it's
coming from outside the bus.  It does seem to be on the drivers side. 
The CV's were just repacked, the tranny seals replaced (per Ron Van
Ness's makeover), and the fluid changed.  I tried to check the
bearings.  No noticeable wheel rock, however, some small movement out,
that is in line with the axle. 

What do I check now. Several things come to mind.  Is my tranny shot? 
That would seem appropriate, the way this project has been going.   If
so, how does that happen just sitting in the bus?  Does this sound like
a wheel bearing? How can I check?  

Again, thanks for all replies.
