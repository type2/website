Subject: Monza exhaust

I've used Monza exhaust for years.  This is what I have currently on my '69.  It
gives a louder sound, but quite resonant and pleasant to the ear (if you like
that sort of thing)  I set off car alarms as I drive by sometimes.  Lately I am
quite pleased to be quieter with stock exhaust on my my Vanagon.  I think the
Monza is of a good quality, attractive to look at, and easier to install than
the stock rig.  John Jensen in Annapolis
