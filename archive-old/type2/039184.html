&gt; &gt; Diameter, radius what's the difference?
&gt; Well being the kooky math teacher that I am, here we go!
&gt; To put the definitions in simple terms the diameter is the distance across a
&gt; circle through the center.  The radius is the distance from the center to the
&gt; circle.  The plural of radius is radii.  A diameter is the same as two radii.

Well, the same follows in my physics classes, except that radius is also
sometimes used as a generic term for &quot;distance between points&quot;.

Nevertheless, the distinction between a student who understands the
difference and a student who does not is &quot;A&quot; and &quot;F&quot;!  :)
