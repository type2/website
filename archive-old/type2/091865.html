Subject: Re: [T2] Friday topic...

After going through about 8 heavy duty bulbs on one attic job i have 
replace the bulb with on of those compact flourescent ones.    After I 
added a power inverter to the westy I now have one out in the westy as 
well on one of those clamp on bulb holders.  At only about 20watts you 
get triple the light of the dome light in the back at the same wattage 
and you can swing it out over the engine for working on it.

&gt; Folks, I picked up 2 new bulbs(incandescent) for my trouble light
&gt; last night for about $2.50 each....rough service bulbs are expensive!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Looked at the flourescent trouble lights and wondered if they were
&gt; really better.
&gt;
&gt; The question is...who uses what and why?
&gt;
&gt; I like the idea that flourescent is cooler(no more burned stuff), but 
&gt; can
&gt; you really *see* with them??(on your vw....mandatory vw content&lt;grin&gt;)
