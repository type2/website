Subject: clutch question

Hi all,

     I was driving home in my 82 air-cooled westy.  I came to a light &amp; went
to downshift &amp; the thing would not go into 2nd. gear.  I finally got it to
go &amp; then it would not go into 1st. until I was almost stopped.  This got
worse as I got closer to home.  When I backed into the driveway it did not
want to go into reverse without grinding.  I played with the shifting in the
driveway with the same results.  There is plenty of brake fluid in the
reservoir.  Any ideas?  The Bentley does not seem to be any help.
