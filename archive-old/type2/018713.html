hey...thought I might as well jump into this one too...
I always thought that it would be cool to have wooden headlight
trim....you know...the bowls...
wooden vents on the front... the little IIIIIIIII on the front...
wooden hub caps...that would be interesting!..maybe clamps to hold them
on..?
wooden rear view mirror holders...
wooden armrests..
wooden steering wheel..
     &quot;       shifter knob...
     &quot;       wood trim on the seals instead of metal...

one more thing... on the side vent windows on my 71 hardtop westy... i
have the grey seals... are these rare?!?  They're pretty fat and in
GREAT shape!
