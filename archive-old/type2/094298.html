I verified that it's not worth getting one from the garage sale online. I
picked up a 7803 at Pep Boys for $20.  It's the same price at other FLAPS.

&gt;&gt; I don't think this is a good price.  I'm not 100% positive on the model
&gt;&gt; number but I swear I saw this at Pep Boys and Autozone for $20, regularly
&gt;&gt; priced.
&gt; 
&gt; I was thinking that the cheaper 9.95 unit CP7802 was typical of the FLAPS
&gt; cheapie and this is a better quality bit.
