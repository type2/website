Subject: Re: [T2] My Kid's New 74 Bus

Bill,

In contrast to the pragmatists with their wise top-ten lists, I would 
recommend that your son spend plenty of time hanging out in his new bus.  
(Not that you'll need to...)  He should probably consider what color 
curtains would feel best in there, and buy him some incense so it doesn't 
get too funky on long trips.
Also make absolutely sure he's got a copy of the Idiot's Guide somewhere so 
WHEN it breaks down he can think straight, and like, communicate with the 
thing.

The right relationship is everything.
Sean


&gt;My son bought a 74 Bus off of e-bay.  He has been driving it for about a 
&gt;week.  Apart from some backfiring when it first starts up and cosmetics, 
&gt;its appears to be in good running order.  It came with new carbs, new tires 
&gt;and a year old battery.
&gt;
&gt;Immediate needs to buy or schnore are a passenger side rear view mirror, a 
&gt;rim for the spare tire, and an antenna.
&gt;
&gt;He says he is going to restore it, which will be cool if he does.  I was 
&gt;wondering what you guys would recommend as the top ten list of things to 
&gt;check out and make sure are in working order for an old bus like this.
