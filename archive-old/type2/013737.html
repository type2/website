&gt;Well, I've located a '79 Westy ceiling cabinet to put into my '78 bus. My 
&gt;bus has a basic Westy conversion (all cabinets minus the ceiling and the 
&gt;Z-mattress). In my excitement at finding the ceiling cabinet I never got 
&gt;around to first finding out how to install it into my bus, or rather, IF I

Biggest issue is that unless you got one from a hardtop bus you are
SOL.  Those do exist but real, real, real rare for the post '76 interior.
I am assuming you did not install the poptop on yours.  The ceiling
cabinet usually bolts to the closet cabinet and ceiling on the closet side
and then to the ceiling on the passenger side.  But all that to the flat
Westy bed ceiling.  I have no idea in the world how the hardtop one
goes in if you were lucky enough to find one.

Sorry if this bursts a bubble but to make it look good you'll have to do
something?  I love that cabinet though, peeves me the '82 has an
A/C installed there.
