Subject: finding FI air leaks )was vanagon...suicide)

My daughter had the same symptoms as you re stalling- she took it to a
Porsche repair place; the FI is just like a porsche 914- they found the
leak hiding UNDER one of the four intake boot connectors between
manifolds and airbox.  Cracked on the bottom.  In the past, I found a
leak at another airbox connection that's hard to see; it's a rubber boot
that forms a y (aux air regulator?) ; also check the boot that connects
the vacuum brake booster to the airbox.  You could try pressurizing the
airbox with compressed air ()a bike pump would do it) and use a smoke
stick to look for escaping air affecting smoke.  Radon mitigators use a
smoke stick applied to a small drilled hole in the floor slab space to
watch if the smoke is drawn in to prove a subslab space as VACUUM is
applied to a hole at the opposite side of the house.  One trick woodwind
instrument repair people use to look for a leak is to blow smoke into
the &quot;sealed&quot; instrument and look for escaping smoke.  Check the
fireworks stores- smoke producers are small enough that you could stick
it into a tailpipe and force air into the tailpipe- when an intake valve
is open, the air will go into the airbox/hoses area.  I'd think this may
be safer than spraying flammibles near the hose connections?
