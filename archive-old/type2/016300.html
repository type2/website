Subject: Interesting paintjobs

    Last summer I bought a gallon each of hunter green and off-white
acrylic enamel (same as spray paint but not in a spray can) and
brush-painted the beast white top / green bottom (it had been white once
but was more primer than not by then). I removed everything I could and
masked the rest; the secret to a good half-assed paint job is to make it
look as professional as possible. The plan is to overspray the bottom
half with either a darker green or black using either ferns or cedar
boughs as a &quot;stencil&quot; more or less.
    If you wash it carefully and let it dry completely, sand each area
and wipe it with a tack cloth it comes out pretty good. One advantage is
you don't have to do the whole thing in one shot (it took me about two
weeks of evenings and weekends). Also, as I was working on the street I
didn't want to worry about overspray and the neighbor's cars.
    Did the bumpers and wiper arms in black. I've had to touch the body
up a few times but it's been a pleasure to have wheels that it's hard to
do any damage to that I can't fix with a rubber mallet and a paint
brush.
    It does get dusty fast. The paint surface is softer than regular car
paint so it &quot;abrades&quot; after a few months and will usually look a little
dusty if you don't want to wash it every day. Hell, give it a thinned
coat every other spring like you do the patio furniture.
    I had lots of ideas that I still consider and have had some good
suggestions, too. Paint it like a big loaf of Wonder Bread (Hell, it
corners like one). Paint it two tone but with a dark blue bottom and a
plagiarized Van Gogh Starry Night on it (Van Go?). Paint it like a
Seattle Metro bus (could I get sued?). Feel free to use these; just
write the name &quot;Randini&quot; on there somewhere in little letters.
