&gt; &gt;Thanks for all the responses to my last post (about converting a split to
&gt; &gt;disc brakes).  Here's another question for you, a really easy one:  if I
&gt; &gt;wanted a transmission for my '59 that would handle 80 to 100 hp and would be
&gt; &gt;geared high enough to hit 70 or so without deafening me (panel bus- no
&gt; &gt;furniture!), what do I get?  Would a stock trans from a later split be able
&gt; &gt;to reliably take that output?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; The only way my splitty is gonna hit 70 is if somebody straps a JATO rocket
&gt; to the back!  At least I wouldn't have to worry about trying to stop it, any
&gt; building would do!  But seriously (is that possible?) why would you want to
&gt; attempt to go that fast in a splitty?  My bus starts to do the twist at
&gt; about 50 and I don't own enough life insurance to attempt 70.  You obviously
&gt; did some work on the steering/suspension, right?
&gt; 
&gt; Oh yeah, about the noise...if you wind a splitty up to 70 the noise from the
&gt; reduction gears would probably be pretty scary.  I'd think about an IRS
&gt; conversion.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck!
