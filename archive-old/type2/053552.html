Subject: Compression check question

In doing a compression check, is there a difference between readings obtained 
when the engine is hot and those from a cold engine? Also, does it make any 
difference if the throttle is open? The readings I recently got on my engine 
with the engine cold and throttle closed were significantly different from 
those taken by my &quot;mechanic.&quot; Mine are higher ... 

Thoughts?
