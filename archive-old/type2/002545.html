Is there a difference between kick panels for a 1970 bus vs a 1974 bus? My
SC is a 1970 with a 1974 front end. The poblem is I'm not sure where it
changes from '74 to '70. I ordered kick panels for a '70 and the upper
border of the driver side panel is different than the panels that were in
the truck. The panels I received look like those depicted in the WCM catalog
#15 for '68-70 late bus. There is a different part number for the '68-'70
and the '71-'79 but only one picture. My original diver side panel has a
smoother upper contour than the the one's I received ('68-'70). I'm assuming
that I have a 1974 interior in my SC. Any input would be appreciated.
