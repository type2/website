Hi Everybody,
   When I bought our 71 westy it was in several shades of primer grey.  I 
wanted to get paint on it to seal the primer but wasn't ready for a good 
paint job.  I bought myself a spray gun and a gallon of Benjamin Moore fast 
drying enamel that is part of their industrial coatings line of paint. I was 
able to paint the whole bus(one color)in a day and with pretty good results. 
  The best part is that the paint is dry to the touch in about an hour!
   This paint isn't as tough as regular automotive paint and doesn't have 
that deep gloss either.  They do make a hardener/gloss enhancer for it but 
that slows the drying time way down.  I think it looks pretty reasonable 
considering I'm an amateur painter.  There's only one small run in the whole 
bus.
   The paint gun was $100, the gallon of paint $25, a can of solvent for the 
paint was about $10, and several rolls of masking tape and some drop cloths 
about another $20 dollars. So for about $150 I got a reasonablly nice paint 
job.  Once I get the body work finished, I'll get it painted for real.
   For more info on this paint go to
