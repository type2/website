Subject: Re: [T2] New case or line bore old case?

Phil,

I bought a new Brazilian AS41 case with metal cam plugs about two 
years ago. The case was bare i.e. no studs of any sort on it. The 
price was $325 and I picked it up from a shop in Durham, NC.

The only warning I will offer for the new case is carefully measure 
the length and angle of the oil pick up tube. Mine was a bit long and 
the combination of that and an oil temp sender I installed in the 
sump caused oil starvation and toasted a rod bearing. Basically the 
sender pushed the bottom of the screen up and choked the pick up tube.

If you buy a new case, Ronnie has always been honest and helpful with my money.

BTW, Gene Berg will gladly reach from beyond the grave and smack you 
for line boring a case :p

&gt;
&gt;Any recommendations?
&gt;
&gt;Also does anyone know the difference between a $289 case and a $395 case ?
