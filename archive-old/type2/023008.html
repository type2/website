&gt;What kind of oil pressures are these engines running?
&gt;At 65,mph, my oil pressure is at 55 psi----OK?
&gt;When in town, it is at 40psi.

Those numbers are great.

&gt;  What constant cruising speed is safe for these vans?
&gt;I ran it at 70 on the way home the week-end before last when I picked it
&gt;up In Souix Falls SD.
&gt;The rpm was at about 4000.
&gt;Too fast?

Not really.  My bus is happier at 3600 but I keep it at 4000rpm 
occasionally when it's not hot out and I'm in a hurry.

&gt;The oil temp was at about  250 degrees for most of the trip.

A little high, but with synthetic oil and good oil pressure I wouldn't 
worry too much about it.  Don't let it get any hotter though, and avoid 
full throttle when possible.  Slowing down to 65 would probably drop your 
temp 20 degrees.

&gt;And now for the last question.
&gt;The bus has 185x14 Michelins on it.
&gt;The load rating is 1450 lbs, _at_ 40 psi.

The strict load rating is adequate (unless you're bus weighs more than 
5,800 lbs loaded!!) but tires like the above do not have stiff enough 
sidewalls and will not handle optimally on your bus.  They may even fail 
prematurely.  You need at least load range C and possibly D depending on 
the tire.

&gt;I checked the tire pressure, and they were all at 32 psi, so I jacked
&gt;them up to 34 psi.
&gt;I don't want a rock-hard, bang, bang, bang ride, but I want the tires to
&gt;function properly.
&gt;Is this air pressure OK?

Totally dependent on the tire, and since I've never run those tires I have 
no idea.

&gt;And while talkig about tires, I want to increase the size of the tire
&gt;for a better ride, and handling.
&gt;How big of a tire can I put on it?
&gt;205's, 225's ?

On the '74  225/70/14, 215/75/14, 27x8.5x14 will all fit and clear, but may 
not be the best choice due to strength and load rating.  Unfortunately, you 
need a tire with stiff sidewalls to keep your bus from swaying all over the 
road.  Usually, higher load ratings mean stiffer sidewalls, but this is 
only a general rule.  The method I use is to check the tire out before it's 
on the rim.  Using your hands, grab the edges and try to pull them 
outward.  Do the edges feel solidly attached?  If the tire deforms easily 
when you do this, find another tire.  Try this on any passenger car tire to 
see what I mean by &quot;deforms easily&quot;.  The 27x8.5x14 BFG Offroad TA was a 
load range C light truck tire with very stiff sidewalls.  It handled 
superbly but the ride was firm.  Same for the GoodYear Wrangler of that 
size.  Others have had good luck with the 185R14D size (Yokohama Y356 and 
others) which also have very stiff sidewalls.
