Actually, having a friend that will help is one of the best &quot;tools&quot; you can
have for almost any situation.

Subject: [T2] Engine FIXED!


&gt; Last week I posted my tale of woe about the scraping sounds, coming and
going
&gt; then coming again, parking the truck and not being able to start it.  I
had just
&gt; changed pushrod seals, adjusted the valves and feared the worse.  Engine
would
&gt; not start or even sputter.  Sounded like gouging when turing the starter
over.
&gt;
&gt; Well..... I went out this morning and had my neighbor watch the engine and
see
&gt; if he could determine the source of the noise.  I was greeted with &quot;Hey,
your
&gt; engine isn't turning&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Pulled the starter and turns out that the thing was just flat worn out.
Starter
&gt; bushing was almost non-existant and the starter itself was worn to the
point
&gt; were it wouldn't turn and engage properly.
&gt;
&gt; $81 and a new bosch starter &amp; bushing later and the truck fired right up!!
&gt;
&gt; Now I get my vacation back next week instead of tearing apart the engine.
&gt;
&gt; One note:  I am REALLY glad I had the neighbor check, as I was that close
to
&gt; just going out this morning and pulling the engine.  Imagine the
frustration at
&gt; pulling the engine, not finding anything wrong, putting it back in and
finding
&gt; out that the problem is with the starter.
