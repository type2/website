Subject: Tie Rod Balljoint Removal - Clarification of Question.

(Received a couple of responses to my post of an hour or so ago and realized
I wasn't clear in my question.  Additions to my previous post are in
parentheses.)

Well, no responses to yesterday's question regarding the boot on the tie
rod/steering box.  I'll try an easier question. :-)

How the heck do you get the balljoint off (the end of the tie rod)?  (I've
already got the balljoint out of the steering knuckle, now I need to
separate it from the tie rod.)

I started out by trying to loosen the &quot;locknut&quot; mentioned in the Haynes
manual, only to determine that there is no locknut; as far as I can make out
the balljoint just screws onto the tie rod, period.

Since I don't have the steering box out of the vehicle it seems like I just
have to unscrew the balljoint while keeping the tie rod from turning.
There's a &quot;flat&quot; on the tie rod that takes a 12mm wrench, and the &quot;nut&quot; on
the end of the balljoint looks to be 22mm, but I've been unable to muster
enough force here to get things going.  I've given up for the day after
spraying the threads with a penetrating oil.  Any secrets to getting this
thing off?

TIA.
