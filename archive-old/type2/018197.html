Hello everyone,
Thanks for the replies I've gotten on my engine.  Keep 'em coming :-)

OK, I just got done installing only the crankshaft into the case.  I
installed it, seated the bearings, torqued the case mains to 15 ft-lbs
and the small cam studs to 14 ft-lbs.  It again bound up tight.

So it appears the problem lies in the case (align-bore) or with the
crankshaft.  

Of course if there are any other ideas, I'd love to hear them.  I guess
the next step is to take the case back to the machinist and have him
verify that it is cut correctly?

Thanks in advance
