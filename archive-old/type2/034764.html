Subject: Looking for ideas: under the poptop storage

I've got some time on my hands today, and I'm in a 
design-and-problem-solving mood, so I am going to fabricate a set of 
folding bins and cubbyholes that will sit over the front roof under my 
68-73 poptop, and will open up with the poptop.

(When I design and fabricate, I do it in heavy cardboard from empty computer 
boxes).

The idea is to make that space efficient and useful whenever the poptop 
is open for camping. One thing that I know for sure is that I am going to 
install a kind of &quot;medicine cabinet&quot; and a mirror so that I can shave in 
the sink and admire my god-like visage. This will probably require a 
small light.

But I can't think of everything, so if you have some kind of storage up 
there, or have had a great idea but haven't executed it, please p-mail me 
so that I can add your biological diversity to the collective.

Hope you can help.

Thanks,

Mark
