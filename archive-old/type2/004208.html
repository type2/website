I have the lower tin.
I may be able to get the pipes.
I may have the front lower cylinder tin, I have to look. [from a 79, no EGR
hole in the left one]
I do not have the alt. bracket.
I should have the #5 pipe.

Do you also have a 68-79 Bentley?  If yes, go to section 5. Page 13 shows
72-74. You will also need the #5 pipe. It is round. Page 15 shows the oval
one you have.
The round/oval pipes I first mentioned are #1on page 13.
Page 20 shows the tin. Fig 7-1 # 3 + 5 are the lower tin.
Look at fig 7-2, # 7 is right front, left front is not pictured. You will
need both for the lower tin to screw to.




&gt; Thanks for the tips. I don't have the tin or brackets and there is NO vw's
in any
&gt;
&gt; yards around here. Can anyone
&gt; help me with the brackets and tin
