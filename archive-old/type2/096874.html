Subject: Re: getting the elec. fuel pump running

[...]

it's like this: i went to the station to get a gallon of gas to add to the
previous in the tank ~ just to get it into the reserve zone. that's it. i
took a different vehicle. key to ignition, nothing - no longer any fuel
pump buzz. triple check +/- at the fuel pump and its ok. basic test for
life at the 2Xrelay. light out! changed 2Xrelay and light on (gnd to 88's).
horrah. ignition on then zilch. check 2nd 2Xrelay, no light. blown 2
relays? 101 degrees and not giving up. still two weeks left in the summer.

wires tight at the solenoid, 12.5 on the battery. just sounds out of gas.

&gt;
&gt;--Hi Steve, Billy here,
&gt;
&gt;Ran into this problem after my fuel line replacement.
&gt;
&gt;okay:
&gt;
&gt;power to 2x relay on 88y from battery via #30 on solenoid is always hot
&gt;and jumps to 88z. #30 on the solenoid is the big stud/bolt. All of the
&gt;&quot;tabs&quot; are #50
&gt;
&gt;on ignition, the red/white from #50 solenoid closes the relay and sends
&gt;power to pump on the red/blue.
&gt;
&gt;after starting and during running, the relay is closed by the afm (silver
&gt;part of air box). this is to shut off the pump in the event the engine
&gt;dies. Pry the black plastic cover off the afm and you can see the contact
&gt;close/open as you move the flap. With key in run, move the flap (or the
&gt;top of the flap's mechanism in the afm) with your hand. Can you hear the
&gt;pump run? It should.
&gt;
&gt;Check for voltage on terminals 36 and 39 in the afm. Dont meter &quot;across&quot;
&gt;36/39. Check each one to ground, as they are an in/out, not a circuit.
&gt;
&gt;the bentley has test procedures to see if your afm is in spec. they are
&gt;easy. check your pump's ground, clean it up. have someone hold open the
&gt;afm flap, what voltage do you see at the pump?
&gt;
&gt;My problem? Bad ground of the f.i. system to the ground tabs on the case.
&gt;Only got 8volts to the d-relay, which made it swing.
&gt;
&gt;Just spend a lot of time on this one so it's fresh in my head. Let me know
&gt;the year of your bus, so I can look at wiring diagrams with you.
&gt;
&gt;Let me know,
&gt;
&gt;Billy
