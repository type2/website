&gt;I replaced my 78 sender without removeing anything other than the air
&gt;cleaner and a few gizmos on the firewall, yes it can be done, but thin
&gt;hand and arms are usefull and you do indeed need to be a mongolian circus
&gt;contortionist....I did it laying on top of the engine compartment and
&gt;working upside down,.....
