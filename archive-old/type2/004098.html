Subject: White stuff inside the bell housing
Date: Sun, 13 May 2001 19:47:40 +0100
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

The story of my strip down coninues: Pulled off the gearbox, inside the
bellhousing is black and at the nottom is white powder the same stuff is
coating about 1/8th of the teeth on the flywheel.  What is it - emulsified
oil ?
Where has it come from and why so little, why is not all over the flywheel?

Thanks
