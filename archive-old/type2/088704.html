Subject: Fw: [T2] Are these new or restored? - 2002 Type 2



 Hmmm, Cali CHP and LAPD have whole divisions set up for this kinda stuff.
If
 they dont mind crawlin under semi's all day, a bus would just be fun. Knew
a
 guy who made a pretty good living importing gray market motorcycles.
 Everybody was happy, people got kool Japanese motorcycles, the mags got the
 latest koolest stuff to test. Only problem is US vins have a check digit
and
 Japanese ones dont have enough digits. He figured no problem, no one ever
 checks this stuff, just turn in report of sales with good numbers and
 everybody will be happy. Well, everybody was happy until the day the
 federalles knocked on the door. Rumour has it he crawled out a vent that
 day. Ten years later hes still on the run. He was only makeing numbers up,
 changing vins is outright fraud. Yup, you guys are right, no one cares if
 you change a vin number.

&gt; &gt; Why not just take the VIN number off an older bus, and just slap it on
&gt; &gt; the new one?
