Subject: Re: [T2] Must-Have Item - Cup Holder/Storage Unit for Bus

From: &quot;The Bus Depot&quot; &lt;type2_at_busdepot_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Hmmm...I wonder if you could pick up a small round plastic ash tray
&gt; somewhere that would sit inside one of the cup holders...

IIRC, Honda sells something like this to fit a cup holder, since ash trays
have been omitted from many new Hondas.  Strange, since the Japanese seem
to smoke more than Americans.
