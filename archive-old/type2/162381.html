&gt; There will be plenty of pain when you use gasoline to light the bbq.
&gt;
&gt; If you want to blow up yourself and your friends up by using it to
&gt; light the Kingsford, have the phone handy to dial 911.

&gt; Use the gas the way Sheik Yerbouti intended, in the Bus!

well I don't use &quot;old&quot; gas in the bus, but use it instead in my generator
or other gas appliances that aren't quite as picky as the bus, or maybe I
would rather replace a couple hundred dollar generator than a couple
thousand dollar bus if I screw up,  I also usually dilute it with fresh
gas mixing maybe one part old with 3 or 4 parts new gas.
