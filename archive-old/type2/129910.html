Subject: Hineline cries &quot;uncle!&quot;

The offlist traffic to my mailbox overwhelming supports engine 
conversions. It has even crossed the line from a sort of libertarianism 
(&quot;if I want to do this no one has the right to stop me&quot;) that is sort 
of the soul of this list over to a matter of logic (&quot;the conversion 
makes sense&quot;).

So I cry uncle. I'm a retro grouch.

I do hate to watch the decline of an appreciation for what VW achieved 
in these vehicles, though.
