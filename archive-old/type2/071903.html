&gt;Currently the tallest that I am aware of is a .70 gearset.  Combined
&gt;with the 4.86 ring and pinion of the '76 and a 26&quot; tire at 3,000 rpm
&gt;you're cruising a bit over 68 mph.  With the same tires and rpm but
&gt;with a stock 4th its 10mph slower-58mph.

Minor correction - I believe the 4.86 is the '74 ratio (34/7).  The '76
should have 32/7 or 4.57 final drive.  That pushes the cruising speed up to
over 72 mph.  I would really think about not doing this since the motor
will have a hard time pushing the bus to this speed at only 3000 rpm, not
to mention that the gap from 3rd to 4th will be huge with the .70 ratio -
you will be pulling the slightest hills (or level ground with a headwind)
at 55mph in 3rd.
