Correct. You have a wiring problem.

&gt;Where is the fuel coming from when there is no fuel pressure and where 
&gt;is the signal to open the injectors coming from???

There is enough fuel pressure under normal conditions to cause the excess to be returned to the tank. When you unplug the AFM and kill the pump the engine will continue to get fuel that will be trapped in the fuel rail (pressure regulator blocking it) until the engine eventually leans out and starves.

&gt;3.  These are the fuel pressures that I measured:
&gt;	Engine not running, key on on position  38 PSI
&gt;	Engine running at idle, 900RPM vacuum hose disconnected from fuel 
&gt;pressure regulator  37 PSI
&gt;	Engine running at idle, 900RPM vacuum hose connected to fuel pressure 
&gt;regulator  32 PSI
&gt;	Engine running, 3000 RPM, vacuum hose connected to fuel pressure 
&gt;regulator  27 PSI
&gt;
&gt;	Do these values seem normal? 

Yes.

&gt;Would any of these conditions contribute to a lean condition?

No.

&gt;4.  What would be a normal vacuum reading at the air distribution box 
&gt;(plenum)???

15-18&quot; of vacuum.
