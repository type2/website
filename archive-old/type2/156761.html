&gt; A good example is Mercedes cars in the USA. They are not sold here by DCAG, Daimler-Chrysler. They are sold to
&gt; the US authorized dealers by MBUSA. MBUSA buys them from DCAG in Germany. A Mercedes in Europe comes with a 2
&gt; yr/unlimited mile warranty to the 1st buyer only!
&gt; Here in the USA, the car comes with a 4yr/50K bumper to bumper warranty that stays with the car. That warranty
&gt; is supported and funded by MBUSA only. Along with that, they also back the 7/70 Calif and 8/80 Fed emission
&gt; warranty. When parts fail they have to go back to the part manufacturer for a refund. With the price of a MB,
&gt; you gotta wonder how much MBUSA is paying for them from DCAG and then be self-supporting to meet the payroll
&gt; of MBUSA [it is huge!] and support the warranty. Yes, they do have problems......  The difference between MSRP
&gt; and invoice is 6%.

I think with MB there is also a certain amount of &quot;image keeping&quot; in the
US market.  We don't seem to get the more &quot;pedestrian&quot; models that are
sold elsewhere.  MB seems to want to stay upscale in the US.

(my opinion, of course.  Karl, correct me if I am wrong.)

The same seems to apply to other makers.  Small station wagons from Japan?
Forget it, all the US gets is mini-SUVs  that sell for 50% more.
