I'm a college student, majoring in Geography, like computer cartography,
GPS, etc. (It's a lot more interesting than it sounds, really.... :) 

I'm married to a computer nerd who makes a fair amount of dough, so I guess
you could say that my VW habit is truly supported by someone other than
myself. :) 

You know how some young wives want to something to nurture, but the couple
doesn't want to have children yet, and so they get a pet? I got a bus. :)
