Subject: Re: [T2] URGENT-ENGINE PROBLEMS-PLEASE HELP-

&gt;I recently dropped the engine in my 72 bus so I could replace the
&gt;clutch.  Now that the engine is back in the bus, I am having problems
&gt;with it firing.  I am getting spark to the distributor and the carbs are
&gt;getting gas.  Why am I not getting any spark to the spark plugs?  Is the
&gt;distributor not lined up and do I just need to pull it?  I am kinda in a
&gt;bind.  I have to get it running today, for there is a wedding I need
&gt;attend this weekend in Tampa, FL.  This is an 8 hour drive.  PLEASE
&gt;HELP.

If you did not remove the distributor then don't remove it this time. Did 
you loosen it and rotate it? If not, don't touch it.

Check to see if the spark plug wires are in order.

Check to see if you have the wires on the coil in the right order and right 
polarity.
