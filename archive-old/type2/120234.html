Subject: Sunroof seal

Hey all
Im looking for a sunroof seal for a 71 bus with a
sliding sunroof and the salesman at wolfsburg said
that one from a bus from the 1980's possibly could
work if the two were the same size and dimention. Does
anyone have a newer 1980 or over bus with a sliding
sunroof and could you give me the measurements from it
if you do?
Thanks everyone
Rus

71 bus in Bartlesville OK
