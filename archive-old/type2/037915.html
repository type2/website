Subject: Re: October 71 Bus

I've seen some catalogs where you determine which part is appropriate
for certain years by using the VIN as the cutoff (or 1/2 year). The last
six numbers of your VIN represent which number your bus was in the
production line for that year. You might want to go to the type2 library
and look up the M-codes to determine if your bus is really an &quot;early 72&quot;
or just has had some weird experiences down the line. October sounds
pretty early to me (my bus's birthday is 10/2/72, #29210 off the
assembly line), but model-year 72 was one of those transitional years
where serial number order could make a big difference.

Hope this helps,

Nikki

&gt; My 72 westy has a October  1971 sticker on it. I know the model year
&gt; started off in August but I was wondering if mine would be considered an
&gt; early 72, at what point did they say 72 1/2 ? March of 72?
&gt; The reason for asking is I had ordered front emblem clips for the 72, it
&gt; said 72-78 I think, however they are not the right clips, I then found
&gt; that a front emblem in WCM says it's for 68-72 1/2 , so it's these clips
&gt; I need, right? My emblem was behind the seat and all clips where gone so
&gt; I have none to compare to. I had read in the archives where someone used
&gt; #8 blue wall anchors for their clip, however my holes where to big and
&gt; they would fall thru the hole with the slightest bit of pressure. Is the
&gt; hole suppose to be 3/8, that's what mine are.
