Subject: Re: [T2] best rubber for sliding window on my 78

&gt; Are you sure it is WCM? We did ship some WCM seals 7 years ago, but even
&gt; then most of it was not WCM (unless someone specifically ordered the WCM
&gt; version from our site). 
Sorry Ron! My memory is about useless these days... I know I bought 
everything I could via you guys for that series of window replacements...

For the record I'm very pleased with everything I ever got from you guys 
except 2 bumpers and you were quick to offer to exchange them. I kept 
them. They were budget bus bumpers and surprisingly despite the rough 
grinding they got prior to the factory chrome job, they have lasted 
quite well. I had two ignition locks / switches that I griped about but 
that was because I was using a worn lock with a new switch. Finally 
figured that out. Again you guys were quick to help. I just placed 
another order a couple weeks ago and again service and price were 
excellent. I NEED to spread my business around so we've got all you guys 
to lean on when we need parts but I go to you out of habit.
