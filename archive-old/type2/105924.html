Subject: Re: [T2] A TIREsome thread

&gt;I also considered Cooper truck tires.  They seemed to have it all, but are 
&gt;$97 for the tire alone.  The first question is whether to go with 
&gt;all-terrain tires.  I like the idea of the look and versatility of an all 
&gt;terrain tire, but they are more expensive and with a lower load 
&gt;range.  The lower load range seems to be the big drawback for AT 
&gt;tires.  Also, realistically the worst terrain we drive on are dirt roads 
&gt;in state parks and we have never had any trouble even with passenger 
&gt;tires.  Is there any thing else I should consider about all terrain 
&gt;tires?  Is there any other reason to select them over the other options?

NOISE. Can you hear me??? &lt;grin&gt; My experience is based on a Toyota 
Landcruiser. The tires we had on it were also scary on wet pavement as the 
rubber was hard and not grippy. Several 180 degree spins in wet weather.

YMMV.
