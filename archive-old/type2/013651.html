Steve,

John reports that he's seeing 20 degree cooler CHT and Oil temps
with the ceramic coated exhaust.  The only reason I can see for this
is that given the layout of the engine, there's no appreciable
airflow over the exhaust system in our busses, so the more heat
that gets transferred (i.e. a non-ceramic coated exhaust) results
in hotter temperatures.  That's the only way I can figure it, as it 
seemed
to me that all other things being equal, ceramic coating at steady state
would prevent cooling the exhaust.

If temperatures go up with the heat transfer coefficient, then there's no
appreciable cooling going on in the first place.
