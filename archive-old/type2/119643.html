You might call him a fool, as he did pass up on a lot of money..... but
his mind was in the people of the company, not so much the money. He was
interested to know every employee by name,, and the bigger the company,
the less friendly it would be,,,

He had a chance to sell and make lots later after FORD, as the robots
REALLY needed that square drive,,, but he refused again,, and they used
the TORX instead,,
