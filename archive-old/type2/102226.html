&gt;Just to add to the confusion, EKTA lists this belt as 9.5 x 965. I bought a
&gt;parts bus last summer and it had some spares with it, one of which was an
&gt;unused vee-belt with a VW dealer tag still on it, it was 9 x 965.

I see your confusion and raise you: mine says 9,7x905mm for 111 903 137D. I guess it doesn't matter that it doesn't have a type2 part number since the engine was used on the 411 first. 914's have the same spec belt that you found: 9.5X965 and the part number is 068 903 137D.

I checked the archives and the answer to some of this fuss is there:

So now that I've got the width issues figured out which accounts for the differences despite the labelling on the belt, is 965mm the right size for the 1700/1800/2000cc motor?

I do have this image of the last belt I bought and it shows the part number as 021 903 137A:
