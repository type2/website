&gt; In the rear compartment of my 1973 Bus, immediately behind the rearmost seat
&gt; someone has cut three sides of a square into the floor panel. This is in the
&gt; panel that forms the top of the engine compartment. The cut is in the center
&gt; and about 6 to 8 inches on a side. They didn't actually remove the metal.
&gt; They just made a really sloppy cut. Several of the buses I've looked at (all
&gt; baywindows) have this same cut.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know why the cut was made? Can it be repaired? What is the best
&gt; way to repair it?

So now I've discovered that someone cut this hole in my bus so as to replace
the fuel tank sending unit without pulling the engine and gas tank. Several
have suggested that there is no way to fix this at home. It was suggested
that a good body shop would be able to cut a section from another bus and
replace it, making look new if they were good enough. However, this would
land us back in the place of having to pull the engine and tank in order to
replace the unit.

I think maybe a better approach to this problem is to find a way to make the
access hole less of an eye sore. I haven't taken a real close look at the
hole yet. What I have in mind is to cut off the flap of metal that remains.
Then fashion a small frame to fit the resulting hole. At that point, hinges
and a lid could be attached so that the hole at least has a finished and
intentional look to it.

What does everyone/anyone think??
