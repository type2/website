I wonder with all this talk about gas tank problems if it's possible to =20
make a plastic version (like some modern vehicles) of our old gas =20
tanks.  It would seem you could make a mold from an existing tank and mak=
e =20
a copy of it and that would cure the problems...(just dreaming)...
&gt;&gt;

Good question; I thought of that as well. It would almost seem like that =
it might have been done already.
