Subject: RE: [T2] Valve Adjusting Screw

Remove the Rocker arm assembly(two nuts) remove and replace the adjuster. 
Check the condition of the others might be a good time to do those as well. 
When you replace it make sure to put all washers shims seals etc. back where 
they came from.

&gt;From: &quot;Kim Kariotis&quot; I was out adjusting my valves today on my 1600 
&gt;singleport and while tightening the bolt after setting on the screw on the 
&gt;feeler gauge at .006  the whole screw and bolt cracked off.

&gt;so, it seems the stud of the screw is still in the hole.  I'm assuming I 
&gt;cannot drive it.  any advice on how to fix it so I don't have to pull it 
&gt;into the mechanic.  Not sure how to get the stud out....I've never really 
&gt;worked on the engine parts except to set the valves.  Its number 3.
