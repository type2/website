Subject: Re: [T2] Timing revisited

Joey,

Lower priced timing lights are &quot;listed&quot; with a +- 2 degree accuracy...the 
more expensive ones talk about +- 1 degree.

Maybe it would help to think of it this way.

An electrical signal travels 6 inches in a nanosecond.
I'm proud to say that Admiral Grace Hopper taught me that!
If you don't know who she is, then just Google it.


5000 rpm = 83.333 rpm's /second

There are a *billion* nanoseconds in a second, ergo...

over 12 million nanoseconds between ignition events at 5,000
rpm's.

The only slowdown in the circuit that I can think of is how fast the 
capacitor that helps fire off the stobe takes to charge up after 
discharging....*if* they still even design the circuit that way.

If the coil in your engine bay can do it, then there is a capacitor that 
can do it.  Digital switching times for  the &quot;gates&quot; in chips used to be 
specified in nanoseconds...about 40 nanoseconds per &quot;switch&quot; IIRC.

So lets be conservative and say it take 100 times longer for the &quot;gate&quot; to 
work and tell the strobe to fire(4,000 nanoseconds) and that the crappy 
cheap made in China capacitor takes 100 times that long the get charged up 
enough to discharge and make a brigh flash(400,000 nanoseconds).

You are still left with over 11 *million* nanoseconds for something to 
happen before the next ignition cycle.

Whew!  thanks forthe chance to use the &quot;ergo&quot; word.  LOL!

Cheers, dave

 This is what I was told (or what I remember being told ...it was a few years
 ago) by a mechanic who also happened to be an electrical engineer. He proved
 it by hooking up several different types of timing lights, 4 if I remember
 correctly, to the same running VW engine. The timing was different for all
&gt; of them by as much as 2 deg. If someone has a few different timing light,
&gt; give it a try and tell us the results.
