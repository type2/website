I posted the following message on Nov. 16, 2000.  I never saw it come
through on the List, and now seems an appropriate juncture to repeat the
question.
-------------------------------------------------

    And on that note, how repairable are the seat _springs_?

    I'm tired of sitting cockeyed on my 1970's driver seat
    because the DPO had an enormous behind and busted
    the springs in the seat bottom on the side next to the door.

    I've about given up on finding a decent replacement seat,
    so Plan B would be to repair the original.

    I can jury rig with added padding, bailing wire, bungee cords,
    etc. but would prefer to repair/replace the broken springs
    if possible.

    &gt;  Don,  I had never done it before, but I recovered the front
    buckets on my '70.  You will need the seat covers, complete,
    seat pads (I used foam, but the purists like the original
    horsehair), and a set of hog rings and pliers.  Do one seat
    at a time so you don't forget how it's supposed to fit.  It takes
    patience and time, but it's really not that hard.  &lt;

&gt;&gt;  You can get replacement original style &quot;horsehair&quot; padding.  Feels like
original, foam does not.  You need to put something in between the padding
and your original springs.  &lt;&lt;
