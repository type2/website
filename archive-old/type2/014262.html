Subject: Engine Knock

Hello all, 
I have looked through the archives but want a more difinitive answer:
I have a 79 FI BUS. I have started using it as my daily driver recently
and now I hear a knocking in the engine, not very load but there and
it does seem to come from the 3rd cylinder. It scares me like crazy and
I've re-tuned my bus but it still seems to be there. Is any knock that
you hear bad news or could I be hearing things and letting my paranioa
get the best of me? Today (this weekend) per the archives I will try
pulling each sparkplug wire and see if the knocking stops. If it does,
does that mean I need the head rebuilt?

Thanks, 
Casimiro
