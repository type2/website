&gt; This exactly why I wrote &quot;Load range C does not mean squat. What is

&gt;
&gt; If you guys want to bet your life on Load range C, go right ahead!

While you're correct that you must pay attention to the max load weight 
marked on the tire, I don't think it's correct to say &quot;Load range C 
does not mean squat.&quot;

As I understand it, you need to pay attention to both:

&quot;Load range&quot; refers to the stiffness of the sidewall, and thus lateral 
force the sidewall can withstand... particularly important when one is 
steering a Bus, going around a corner or bend in the road, etc.

The here is a separate load index that indicates the vertical force the 
tire can withstand.  This is what Karl was referring to.

If you get a tire that has the correct load index but is not at least 
load range C, its sidewall will not have sufficient stiffness, and you 
will have understeer, a sloshy back-end, etc.

When I bought new tires for my Westy, I sought out load range C, but I 
also looked for a sufficient load index (one that could accommodate the 
camper fully loaded with people/stuff).  I ended up with load range C, 
load index 99 (1710 lbs), speed rating P (93 MPH).
