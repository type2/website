Subject: Re: [T2] Prices for a valve job?

Oh, my, Jeffrey. Oh, my.

First, use the archives on this list to learn something about GEX 
engines. If this one had 15,000 miles on it, it was one of their better 
builds.

Second, $1900 for a &quot;valve job&quot; is ridiculous, like paying $32 for a 
cup of coffee. But you are going to want an entire new engine, not just 
a valve job. Your GEX motor is a time bomb.

You can find well-built air cooled engines for as little as $1200. Bus 
Depot, an on-line dealer that many of us use, sells AVP rebuilds for 
about that price (busdepot_dot_com). I just looked and didn't see that they 
have vanagon engines, but I was just skimming.

If you have the space, you can do the engine change yourself, using a 
couple of books and help from this list.

I'm sorry that your VW experience has started out badly. It gets 
better, really.

Mark
