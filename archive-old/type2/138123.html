Subject: Re: [T2] One conundrum from this trip (actually a few, but
  probably related...)

Hi Don,

Check the valves. That's  a 20 minute procedure and if you move the bus 
into the right area of the hotel parking lot they probably wouldn't 
notice. Take some wet-wipes or other clean-up materials out with you so 
you're not looking like a grease monkey walking back in through the 
lobby.

If there is a valve getting tight then loosening it off my help for a 
little while, though the head will need repair soon enough. If not then 
you haven't hurt anything.

Your problem could also be ignition related... have you set the points 
and timing lately?

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; all greasy in their parking lot. ;-)
