They used to sell the neon lights as a cheap alternative to a &quot;real&quot; 12 or
115V timing light.  If you think they are hard to use on a VW, try using
one on a chevy down among the multitude of belts to read the timing mark
on the buried crank pulley.

Neatest setup I've seen was a bug that had a neon bulb on a bracket aimed
permanently at the timing mark.  Checking timing was a matter of starting
the engine and looking at the mark!  :)
