&gt; Gasoline is too volitile, but I have to admit to using it for small jobs.
&gt; Not a good thing, though.

I have a friend... whom shall remain nameless.. who told me of how he
cleaned his chassis...

He said he laid under the vehicle with a tub of gasoline, a scraper and a
rag and removed the years of accumulated gunk that way. He said he was
basically laying in a puddle of gas and covered with gas by teh time he
was done.

I cringed, looked at him like he was an alien,  and told him he must have
a deathwish.  he told me he thinks its perfectly safe and when i
sugggested kerosene or paint thinner he pshawed me.  Oh well, maybe he
will have to learn the hard way, i hope not.

Dont any of you follow his example, its a very very very bad idea... (one
teeny tiny spark and FOOM you are flambe` and dead on the spot or spending
all your time in a burn unit in excruciating pain until you are dead or
they patch you up.)

take care,

Steve
