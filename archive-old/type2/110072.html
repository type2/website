Subject: Re: [T2] 009... Why?

In a message dated 8/14/03 12:22:56 PM, whistlingtin_at_hotmail_dot_com writes:

&lt;&lt; Friends:
It seems that the consensus is that the 009 is the wrong dist for a T4. This
begs the question: Why have so many been retrofitted with 009s?
Cheers,
Matthew &gt;&gt;

1. Mostly Muir...(What was your first VW book...?-)
2. Availability...J.C. etc....
3. Simplicity...Six wires total; no guessing where the vacuum goes...
4. Looks...All the color shots in the mags show chrome 009's with
    chromed tin on upright engines...(emphasis on show...;-(
5. They work...not well but they can get an engine up and running...
