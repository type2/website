&gt;&gt;It does depend on your point of view.


&gt;
&gt;In Canada, $20/hr. would put you in the 40% tax bracket, so you would have
&gt;to work about six hours to keep the $70 to pay the mechanic.  I can't
&gt;imagine any repair that would take me 6 times as long as a mechanic would
&gt;take.  (Of course, I was a mechanic at one time.)

It also depends upon you market and tax situation. My numbers were just
illustrative of the concept. You must plug in the numbers that are right to
your situation.
