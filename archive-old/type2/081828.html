Subject: 79 Bus FS

Hi all

I'm going to sell my 79 Bus.  I bought it to do a FI swap for my 76, but I
don't have the time now or in the forseeable future.

The body is very good.  Small amount of rust in the front floor, battery
tray rusted.  Typical sliding door.  Glass is all good.  It has the sliding
side windows everyone is crazy about.  Missing the middle seat, has a good
rear seat.

The engine supposedly won't run.  I haven't tried it.  The guy I bought it
from said his friend had it downtown and it quit running and all the oil
leaked out.  Well, it's holding a full crankcase now, so I don't know.  It
has all the fuel injection stuff, it ran daily until the episode downtown.

I have about 400 bucks into it all told, so if someone is interested and can
come fairly close to that, let's hear from you.  I'm just south of Atlanta.
I could be persuaded to deliver it to someone in the Atlanta area.  Has a
clear title.

Next weekend the Bus goes on ebarf, or it gets parted.  I really don't want
either to happen.  This is too good a Bus to part out, and I don't have the
time nor the desire to field a bunch of silly questions from someone in
Timbucktwo who isn't serious about buying.
