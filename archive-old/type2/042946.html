Subject: RE: Sump Oil Temp Sender

Couple of questions? Did this increased heat begin with any crankshaft service?

Could it be that the engine is just too tight or the case is in need of 
align boring?

I had a Type I engine one time that was a crate motor for the PO. It was 
always hot - oil, heats, everything. Turns out the case was align bored 
incorrectly and the motor was just binding up.

Synthetic oil is better than dino oil BUT you need to solve your trouble 
instead of just putting a band-aid on it. You have troubles and you need to 
find the cause otherwise eventually when you least expect it (2 AM) in a 
bad section of town or where ever - this problem will leave you walking 
whether you like it or not. I've never left my bus anywhere due to a 
breakdown but I don't want to chance it either.

A stock engine should run cool regardless of the weather (cool enough). If 
yours is hot, there's a problem that fancy oil won't help for long.

If you are lucky, maybe you can run this motor long enough to get it to 
loosen up (only if the bearings are tight), or maybe you'll toast the 
pistons and heads trying.

Don't mean to be a kill joy, but your motor is telling you there is a 
problem. We are lucky to be driving very simple vehicles and one's that can 
be torn down with a minimum of tools. If ya gotta, take the engine down 
yourself and start measuring.
