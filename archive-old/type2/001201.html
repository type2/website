&gt;Replacing that right battery tray 'the right way' is a bear, i know -

Well, for what it's worth, here's what I did:  I cut out the ragged remnants
of both my battery trays sides back to the body or seams, took it all out.
Made a template of the shape and took it to my old welding instructor (local
high school doing adult classes, great resource) and he cut two out of good
heavy sheet stock (maybe 12 ga?  was more than necessary, but a nice solid
feel) and I epoxied them in.  Used the stuff that comes in a can (PF--47,
something like that?)  Sealed it up all around, painted it within an inch of
it's life and have had no trouble at all.

Engine temp went down 25 degrees, no kidding.

Let me know if you want the template.
