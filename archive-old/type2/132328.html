Say what you want about VWOA but they know how to pick the music.

The soundtrack for the VW Touareg commercial (the Touareg is considered a
bus for purposes of this message only, he said plausibly) which is running
every night on the NBC Olympics coverage is by Richard Buckner, album is
_Since_ with copyright date 1998, cut is &quot;Ariel Ramirez&quot;.

Reminds me of the first time my roommate played me a Chris Smither record,
it was a revelation and I rewarded my roommate by wearing out his record for
him throughout the course of the semester. =^)

Richard Buckner shows up in the &quot;Alternative Country&quot; genre on sites and one
quick Google search found him compared to Jimmie Dale Gilmore. Apparently
this is because they are both from Lubbock and don't sell too well, not
because of the timbre.
