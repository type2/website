Today a women (in her 70's) came in the shop with a 71 Highroof camper, she
is traveling in this bus from Havasu, Az. to Truckee, Cal.?  Her route will
take her up through Nevada then across to Truckee. If anybody see's her stop
and have a chat, she has a lot of old timer and new timer stories and is
traveling and living in this bus.

ronnie    always meeting the most colorful people

ps. if you see her broken, stop and help her if you could, this bus is so
loaded down it's riding on the snubbers.
