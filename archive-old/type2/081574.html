Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Swaybar question

&gt; I have heard that certain Type 2 vans (ambulances?) came with factory
&gt; swaybars front and rear.
&gt;
&gt; The Vanagons used the same bar up front and out back.

&gt; I know the catalogs offer aftermarket swaybars front and rear but I am
&gt; looking for a cheaper alternative than $300 of matched front and rear
bars.
&gt; In other words I'm looking for the junkyard solution.

I installed the $300. Sway-a-Way set in my van and learned a couple of
things. When I replaced the front bar (the stock bar was wimpy) there was a
huge improvement in handling. The handling improved from dangerous to pretty
good. A couple of weeks later I got around to installing the rear bar, with
little or no improvement in handling. I would find someplace that just sells
the front bar and replace that. By the way, Fisher's &quot;How to Hotrod VW's&quot;
states strongly not to install a heavy duty bar in the rear without
upgrading the front bar. The front bar is far more important, and Fisher
says that installing a rear bar only will cause the handling to be worse.
