Subject: RE: VW Camper &amp; Bus Magazine is Here!

&gt; Just a note that I now have more issues of the U.K. published 
&gt; &quot;VW Camper &amp; Bus&quot; magazine in stock.  To my knowledge it is 
&gt; the only English language magazine exclusively devoted to VW 
&gt; busses, vans and campers. It's a fascinating read, and a 
&gt; &quot;must-read&quot; for Bus enthusiasts. There are tons of tech 
&gt; articles, pictorials, buying guides, info on camper 
&gt; conversions never found in the U.S., and more. Each issue is 
&gt; about 100 pages. 


Here's a better link (shows all 3 at once)...
