Subject: Re: Bad CV joint?

It does seem like you have a CV joint problem.* It could however be merely a 
lack of sufficient lubrication in the joint. I have the same van as you, and 
experienced the same noises. So far I have been successful in correcting the 
problem by removing the half shaft in question and adding some moly-base 
grease to the joints. I observe that there is a slight leakage of grease 
over time, and the noise begins when enough grease has leaked so as to 
prevent sufficient lubrication of the moving parts. I must hold the record 
for boot life: it still has the original boots from 1975! So if you haven't 
tried the topping-off with grease solution, give it a shot.

*I found similarly to you that if I jacked-up the side with the problem, 
then merely spun the wheel by hand, that enough of the remaining grease 
would redistribute to temporarily stop the noise.
