i recently purchaced a 77 VW transporter which has a problem
when i try and shift into first gear. second, third and fourth go in OK....but first and reverse are tricky. How hard is it to replace the linkage in this type of van and where would i locate the parts for this operation. any help would be greatly appreciated.
