Subject: bus nose damage pics

http://www.kellieandchris_dot_com/images/bus_web/

just a few shots of the damage done to the nose on my bus recently.

now its time to find a shop in the bay area to do some of the work.

suggestions? I think there is a place across the st from Freds down in 
redwood city that works
on busses, but im not 100% on that.
