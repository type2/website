&gt; I probably would have my engine in by now except I forgot to order my
clutch
&gt; alignment tool when I ordered all the other stuff for my new engine.
&gt;
&gt; The moral of the story is, Make a list and check it twice. Then check it
again
&gt; befor ordering parts for your rebuilt engine, lest you spend 3 hours
trying to
&gt; find that little detail you forgot.

A clutch alignment tool is handy, but not really necessary. I've put in
probably 4 to 5 clutches in various vehicles without one. If the hole in the
disk is concentric with the hole in the crank and the pressure plate, you're
good to go. I snug the pressure plate down until it puts enough pressure
against the disk so the disk won't move under the influence of gravity, but
I can still move the disk with a screwdriver or dowel. Move it a little,
eyeball it to see if everything lines up and when you're sure you've got it
positioned right, finish tightening down the bolts.
