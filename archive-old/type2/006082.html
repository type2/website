 Hi, My name is Dave West.  I am new to the list.  My wife, children and I
are a Volkswagon family.  We currently have a 67 deluxe hardtop type 2, a 74
Westy poptop, a 61 beetle ragtop, and a 66 beetle sedan.  The first car I
learned to drive a standard transmission was my aunt's 68 beetle.  I didn't
drive any other volkswagons after that till I was about 30.  My wife wanted
a VW bus.  I found a 74 Westy for $1200 and we bought it.  10 days and many
new parts later we left for Baja in the bus towing a 15 ft Sunfish sailboat
with our three kids.  The bus did great on the trip.  We made it all the way
to Bahia de los Angeles in Baja Norte before we had to head back at the end
of spring break.  On both the way down and back up we stopped in the town of
San Quintine.  the town is very traditional with a park in the center and
all the shops and official buildings surrounding it.  We stopped at the
police station and asked if it was allowed to sleep in our vehicle parked at
the park across the street from the station.  They said of course.  In the
morning the park bathrooms are opened by an old lady.  She cleans the
restroom after each patron.   It cost about 25 cents.  On the way down we
were approached by two American college students on break.  They were headed
south, so we gave them a ride south.  We dropped them off in Bahia.  The
last we saw of them they had rented a small stone house on the beach and
were swinging in a hammock.  Bahia was beautiful.  We stayed at a small
private campground called Campo Gecko.  We had a small &quot;palapa&quot;  (palm
thatched roof without walls) obout 30 feet from the high tide line for $5.
The Sailboat had broken its rudder and dagger board during the tow.  The
owner of the camp helped me fabricate a replacement out of wood washed up on
the beach.  We stayed for 4 days eating fresh smoked albacore that we got
right out of the smokehouse in Ensenada, mangos, papayas, and cheese and
tortillas.  On the trip back north we again stayed in San Quintine.  Again
we asked permission to sleep in the bus.  Again we were told no problem.
The next day I was trying to tune the bus.  It was running poorly after to
much bumping around in the dessert.  Two police officers came over and asked
what I was doing.  I told them in poor Spanish that my timing and carb
adjustments had gone out while in the desert.  I was expecting them to cite
me for some type of infraction, instead one of the two said that he used to
drive a volkswagon, and would I mind if he looked at it.  He and his partner
spent about 30 minutes in the engine bay.  When they were done the timing
was better, the carbs were in sinc with eachother, and they had found a few
vacume fittings that had come off.   We thanked them for their help and
offered them $20 for their time.  They were insulted and replied that they
were public servants.  It was my sons birthday.  We went to the panadria and
ordered a birthday cake to be made.  We then went to the mercado to try and
find a birthday gift.  San Quintine is below the tourist areas.  The only
shops in the town were for the locals.  We ended up finding a sombrero and a
toy car for Steven.  The police force of San Quintine came across the street
for cake and punch.   The next morning two americans knocked on the bus.
They had gone off the road and flipped their jeep about 60 miles south.
They had hitchhiked back to San Quintine.  We gave them a ride to their
jeep.  Abandoned cars in the desert in Mexico are like shipwrecks at sea,
When we got them to the jeep all their belongings, suitcases, sleeping bags
etc were gone.  Three of the jeeps rims were destroyed.  We got them a tow
truck from Rosalia.  The llantara(used tire shop) had three used tires with
jeep rims, we flipped the jeep back on its wheels, and took photos to
document the sight and headed uneventfully back to the border.
     The westy has been on sebaticle for the past few years.  It blew a
motor 2 years after the baja trip, and is waiting till 2003 when it will be
exempt from the california smog laws.
    See you on the road.
        Hasta la vista,  David West
