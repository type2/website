&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm about to overhaul my carb, a 30-PICT-3 on
&gt; my '70 Westy.
&gt; 
&gt; As I am exempt from Smog here is California, what
&gt; is the option on removing the throttle positioner doohickey!
&gt; 
&gt; Good? bad? makes no difference?
&gt; 
&gt; I have a stock 1600 SP with '009 dizzy.

You will notice no difference.  The only thing the positioner does (if
it is working at all!) is to hold the throttle slightly open when
manifold vacuum is high and the throttle is closed.  This keeps the
engine &quot;burning&quot; and reduces output of unburned fuel.  It is a factory
&quot;add-on&quot; emission control device that was only added for the US, AFAIK.

However, if you remove it, be sure to record all the hose runs and put
all in a nice plastic bag against future re-installation.  You never
know when the smog nazis are going to do in the future.

George
