Hey now,
        This being Friday I thought I'd share a goodie I heard this AM on
KLBJ, a local radio station. SLAPS, BTW, stands for Stupid Local Auto Parts
Store.

        One of the station guys called around to local auto parts stores.
Said he had a '68 Chevy broken down on the side of the freeway, and he
needed a &quot;sphincter&quot;. Even spelled it out a couple of times. He explained
that it was a small opening in the rear end that opens and closes,
something to do with fluids. Now for the fun part... Most of the counter
folks hummed and hawed, then said &quot;that sounds like a dealer part, I've
never heard of it&quot; or the like!!! Only a couple realized that they were
being had, and started to play along. Then there were the clueless... One
gal, when he asked if she knew what he was talking about, said &quot;Yes, hang
on just a minute&quot;, and one fellow said &quot;I have one here for a '69&quot; !!!!
:-P  The radio guy was surprised, but went with it, and said &quot;what's it
look like&quot;? To which the counter guy says &quot;uhh, well, uhh, it's uhh, kind
of round...&quot; Don't you love it when FLAPS says &quot;Yeah, I've got that part&quot;,
and it doesn't even exist...    ;-)

        And while I'm wasting bandwidth, my newest bumper sticker for the bus:

                                 UFO'S ARE REAL
                          (the Air Force doexn't exist)

Peace,
