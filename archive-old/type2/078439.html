Subject: Re: [T2] clutch replacement


Don't forget the 0-ring that fits in the back of the flywheel, and a set of
new flywheel bolts. Retorquing used bolts can be risky. They aren't
designed for reuse, though many do with no problems. If they come loose,
you lose the flywheel and crank, requiring complete teardown and crank and
flywheel replacement. Small probability of BIG risk for the price saving of
new bolts vs old.

&gt;hello all,
&gt;
&gt;i am replacing my clutch next saturday. i have ordered
&gt;the following,
&gt;
&gt;luk heavy duty clutch kit
&gt;flywheel lock
&gt;transaxle drain socket 
&gt;rear main seal
&gt;and
&gt;haynes manual
&gt;
&gt;from the bus depot, i also plan to get a new flywheel.

Rarely necessary. Get the opinion of a VW machist, or just send it in as a
core for a reground replacement. Regardless, when changing a flywheel you
must recheck the crank endplay, and if adjustment is required, measure the
existing shim and order the correct one for the new set up, all before you
put in the new oil seal. Measure end play with the new flywheel and used
bolts, then install correctly calculated shim, then the oil seal, then the
flywheel with new bolts. Viton or Silicon oil seals are worth the extra
cost over stock rubber. Last much longer.
