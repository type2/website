Subject: Dash Clocks for cheapskates

For those of us with sensitive ears (hate that click as the stock clock
resets its spring) and shallow pockets, you can look for a battery
powered clock that fits into the space and if needed, cut a circle of 
black naugahyde that fits over it - I did that for a square shaped clock
with a round face sold by Radio Shack (or was it Staples?).  Until it
died, a previous round clock had to be ground around the edges to fit,
and a groove in one side (hacksaw) allowed a bike spoke or an ick pick
to be inserted and the clock pried out to change the batt.
