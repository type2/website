Subject: '71 Bus for sale in Seattle

1971 VW Van Named &quot;Frank&quot; - $500

Not for sale by me, but I've seen it--if anyone wants
particulars.

This is an orange '71 deluxe with a few dents, but no
Bondo(tm) work that I could find.  It's got rust in the
usual places--the thing's in SEATTLE fer crissakes!
A couple of rust spots on the roof, but the battery tray
is intact.  Not a canditate for resto, but could be a
nice (enough) beat-around-driver.  Most of the interior
panels are gone.  The generator light came on five years
ago, and the driver parked it.  She's getting ready to move,
and doesn't want to mess with it.  Engine appears stock!
No candy-coated-chrome-crap, less efficient than stock
oil coolers, etc.  I would have bought it, but I need a
pop-top.  If none of you snap him up, I just might do so
myself, anyway.

For details, E-mail me at  &lt;nisse_at_centurytel_dot_net&gt;
or Tara, the owner, at &lt;tmorgan_at_bust_dot_com&gt;
