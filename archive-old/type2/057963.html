I've finally figured out that it's my auto trans leaking rather than the
engine. I assume that it's at least partly the torque converter seal and could
just kick myself for not thinking of that when I had the engine out a few
months ago to repace it's seals.

 What throws me a bit is that the fluid collects not only on the engine where
it is presumably blown by air flow but it also collects forward of the tc
which suggests that maybe it's just the trans oil pan gasket leaking. There's
no apparent leak at idle so I can't pin point  the source.  I'd love to invest
in a gasket or two and 6 qts of fluid rather than pull the engine again.
Anyone know how to tell for sure if that seal is bad without pulling the
thing?

Thanks,

Weston
