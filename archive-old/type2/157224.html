&lt;good reasons snipped&gt;

[science teacher mode]

Remember that petroleum ether is nasty flammable stuff with a wide
ignition range (which is why it makes such great starting fluid).  It's
meant to be sprayed into an intake, not onto a surface where it will
evaporate into the air forming a flammable cloud.  I'd certainly hate to
be under the bus in a cloud of the stuff if I had the bad luck to have a
stray spark (say, from dropping the steel can onto concrete) ignite the
ether/air mixture.

Be careful out there!
