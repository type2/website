Subject: RE:[T2] tent poles/steering box

&gt;my fuel gauge sending unit is faultly.  can i get it recalibrated or
&gt;do i need to fork out some dough and buy a new one.

could you be more specific? what is the needle doing at what points with
the key on? for example, my sender read a bit more than half when the tank
was topped. in my case i am guessing the float is funky.  - steve
