&gt;I'm personally satisfied with this concept, especially because GL4 is so hard
&gt;to find, unless you want to buy a big pail of it. My local lubratorium has
&gt;GL5/MT1, and I've changed it twice.

Since there is such an interest in premium MT fluid I should mention that Swepco 201 is another GL5/MT-1 gear oil. A favorite in the Porsche crowd and I've been using it for 8 months. BTW, it's green if you are a fan of ATE SuperBlue. ;-)

I can tell you where I bought it...otherwise contact www.swepco_dot_com to find a dealer or perform a google search of the Porsche parts dealers. Sold by the gallon only, around $38.
