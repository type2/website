Ned,

It ain't easy to undo those four bolts. 

I recently had to undo them to replace my torsion bars and they were on 
TIGHT.

I ended up using a small bottle jack pushing against the end of a socket 
bar to loosen the bottom rear one on both sides. The others came loose 
by tapping with a small club hammer (a baby sledge hammer) on the end of 
a breaker bar. Actually, I whacked the bar as hard as the limited space 
would allow.

It's doable but it's the main reason I'm putting off doing it again to 
adjust one of my torsion bars (I didn't get it quite right the first time 
and I have a list to port).
