Subject: 68-79 Driveway Tent For Sale/Trade Arnold Md

I am selling my tent, very good condition.
Has a small rip in the bottom front door netting where
a squirrel got in, one thumb nail size whole in the
side screen and a little of the rubber that attaches
to the bus in pulling away otherwise very nice:
Would trade for a good running dual port for my
European 75 Double cab, w/Type 1 engine or sell for
$500.
Additionally stay tuned as the Metal Wiz should be
completing the body work on my 67 Westfalia.

Feel free to call would rather not ship but would at
cost if need be.  Tent and pole bags are not worth it,
otherwise complete!
