&gt;The sizes of type 4s were 210, 215 and 228mm. The 210 and 215 works great in
&gt;a type 1 trans, with type 1 starter, but the 228 will not..

And if anyone wants either a 210 or 215 they can have one free
if you pick it up in Clarksburg WV.  I think I have one that had
a nearly new clutch and pp.

Not to raise fights but what were used on &quot;real&quot; type 4s with sticks
and were any of them ever 6V in Europe (probably not.)

John
