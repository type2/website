First, an apology for sending the heading of this note
twice.

On to CV joints:
A few years ago, we I got a call from one of my sons,
who should have been at work.  He had a CV joint
failure as he was slowing for a stop sign, and the CV
joint completely seperated, allowing the wheel to
flop, sending him into the curb, ruining a wheel and
tire.  Luckily he was traveling at a very slow speed.
Now, this was in a VW Rabbit, with front wheel drive,
and CV joint failure shouldn't be so catastrophic in a
bus,
since the bus rear axle has more support, but still,
this kind of thing can happen with serious results.
Check and maintain those CV joints!
