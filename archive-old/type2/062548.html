So MICHAEL G BENTHIN says:
&gt; Believe it or not, when an attendant lost my cap, they offerned to pay for
&gt; new one- so I checked dealer; they are still available ( in in 2 days if
&gt; you order it) and cost $21.......nice original VW, good rubber seal...

On my last trip back from So. Cal and camping with the CCC's, I left
my locking cap at the pump in Fresno.  This is partially due to a 
different than normal fill-up routine which meant that I gave my
key to my wife and normally I leave it in the cap so I'll remember
it.  Well, fortunately, I was keeping receipts.  When I discovered
my loss, I checked the price at the dealer, $45 for the cap and about
aother $20 to get it keyed (Yikes!).  So I called the Shell station
in Fresno that I left it at and they said they had it.  After a making
a call to the post office, I ended up sending the gas station a $3.00 +
~ $1.50 postage packing envelope with a $3.00 priority mail postage stamped
on it and got the cap back in a few days.  Whew!  $7.50 as opposed to
$65???  I'll take that any day...   :)
