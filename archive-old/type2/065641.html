Muffler systems that hook directly to your heater boxes are readily available
for not much more than $100 from JCW and Parts Place etc. &quot;Monza&quot; is the name
that comes to mind with dual exhaust pipes and looks very cool. If you aren't
subject to emission equipment inspections these are ideal.
