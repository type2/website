&gt; it ran before i rebuilt the  motor    /the rings  were shot  on one
&gt; side
&gt; so i  bought new heads from these assholes who  are no help&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt;www.mofoco_dot_com&gt; and  new barrels new rings  new pistons  and  gasket
&gt; kit.they fucked  up my order and  sent me other parts  so i got 1800cc
&gt; pistons and barrles  and  2000cc heads  for  my  1700  they siad  it
&gt; would
&gt; still work??? i asked  other vw  folks they siad  it would  also.
&gt;=20
&gt; i rebuilt  it all to specs  and torks   i have  like  5 service
&gt; maunals. i
&gt; didnt split  the case&lt; ilooked at the cams  they look fine  all the
&gt; rods
&gt; were fine and cases. i looked  at the oil pump  and  filled it with oil
&gt; and
&gt; put it back
&gt; i  set all the valves and  triple checked them after  hand spining the
&gt; motor.  it  seem  a little  tight  /with the plugs  out / i thought it
&gt; was
&gt; because  of the new parts. i put  it back in the body  hooked
&gt; evertihgn
&gt; back up got a new starter/
&gt; i try priming the oil opump  by starting  with the plugs  out  for a
&gt; few
&gt; min. then  i put  the plugs  in / oil light did  got out/
&gt; i had  it running  for a min then it stalled.  seem tight like  it
&gt; would
&gt; only run with a high idle &lt; i had  the choke dis armed  other wise  it
&gt; would mees  up  when i stalled&gt;  it  stalled  a few times  and  i
&gt; tryed  to
&gt; hand spin  it ,it would not  turn  it was  tight ??? hummm??
&gt;=20
&gt; so i started  again.  it  ran  and  stalled again.  i looked in the
&gt; under
&gt; the back and  i saw oil dripping  .  so  i stopped  not sure  where it
&gt; was
&gt; leaking  becasue  it went all over  might have been the filter ?who the
&gt; hell
&gt; knows.
&gt;=20
&gt; this  was  in the spring  time ive been so busy  i haven made time  for
&gt; it
