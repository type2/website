&gt;No you don't.  Just swivel the seat 180 degrees till it is facing

van.

David,
Gotta disagree with you on that one.  To get to the battery box on the 
PASSENGER side you can indeed simply swivel the seat 180 degrees and 
slide it a bit.

But, I believe we are talking about the box on the driver's (left) side.  
In that case, of course, because of the steering wheel, the seat will 
not swivel 180 degrees.  You do have to remove the seat (which is really 
easy) and then swivel the platter 180 degrees to get to the box.
