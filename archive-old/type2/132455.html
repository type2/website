Randall,
I don't believe the '72 had an air pump. I had a '72 with air conditioning
and the pulley was used to drive a belt for the AC. Has the left rear tin
section been hacked? That's where my compressor was mounted.

&gt; In disassembling and cleaning my new/used 1700cc motor I found a
&gt; pulley between my fan and fan hub.  Bentley shows a spacer, but this
&gt; is a pulley.  The motor had the air pump shaft (removed, no air
&gt; pump).  What would the pulley be used for?
