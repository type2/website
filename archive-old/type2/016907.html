I have been off the list for some time, so this is the first time I have 
heard of this subject. I suggest the gentleman with the police state attitude 
park outside bars and save lives that way. I drive 20 mph over the speed 
limit on a regular basis, go through red lights when there is no traffic in 
sight, and have NEVER had an accident. Speed is not dangerous. Poorly 
coordinated drivers, and those who do not understand the rules of the road 
are a much bigger concern.
