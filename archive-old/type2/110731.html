It rumbles really bad when releasing the clutch in first like the thing is comeing apart.
the only oil leak that i have at the momment is with the oil filler tube which i will be takeing apart tonight to fix and seal and replace wednesday night so that the seal will have plenty of time to rubber up for me..
