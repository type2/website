Subject: westy stove testing/repairs?

hello gang,

I recently picked up a 76 westy in near junker condition and have been
putting it back on its feet. most of the major work is done (for now) and
it's time to turn to the creature comforts, namely getting the stove working
so I can cook breakfast after a long night out and about ;)

the gas and stove setup looks to be in reasonable condition and I had an
inkling to just bring the bus to an RV center to get the tank filled and
then splosh soapy water on as much of the system as I can to check for
leaks. could it be that simple? are there specific areas that I should check
more carefully? has anyone seen a guide for westy stove repairs?

if this is something best left to the pros, can someone recommend a good
westy/RV stove repair shop in the SF bay area? actually, even if I can do
this myself, I'd love to hear if anyone out there knows a shop like that.

many thanks,
pete
