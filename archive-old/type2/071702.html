Subject: Deck Height/CR

All right you expert mechanics, check my math.  I'm getting ready to 
put the barrels and heads on my 82/83? vanagaon aircooled engine 
rebuild project.  I decided to go with new AMC (no flames please, OEM 
VW are not available for this engine to my knowledge) heads, and 
Mahle (Brazilian) barrels.

Here's the math:

Deck height (w/ no gaskets or shims) = .025&quot;
chamber CC  =  56 cc
Piston Dish  =  15 cc

Swept =  94mm x 71mm  (1970 displacement)

My gasket set came  with neither paper or metal bottom barrel gaskets 
(interestingly it came with 8-.029&quot; barrel to head gaskets which I 
don't plan to use).

The AMC heads have a built in ridge at the contact point of the barrel.

Which way would you build these?:

7.53:1 CR with no gaskets

or

7.41:1 CR with .008-.010&quot; metal barrel gaskets I have in inventory.

This Van probably will never go below 4200 Ft altitude and the fuel 
mixture will be set towards the rich side  (1.5% to 2.0% CO).

What do you think?
