Subject: Buses and Astronomical Holidays

If you are at all like me, you have a mental or written list of little
tasks that you mean to accomplish some day, the better to make for a more
perfect bus. For example: tying off that loose bit of wiring that is
hanging after installing a radio. The tidy new seal on the tin where the
oil filler tube passes through that you didn't quite get all the way on
because you were too lazy to loosen up the screws on the tin. Converting
all those yucky plastic curtain ties in your Westy to leather. These are
jobs that tend to hang, and hang, because they are too tough to take on at
a whim, and too negligible to stop us in our tracks to get them done.  Not
to mention such odd jobs and changing transmission oil, bleeding out old
brake fluid and bleeding in new, that sort of thing. 

I propose that as a function of the list's spirit we celebrate the four 
astronomical holidays -- summer and winter solstice, spring and fall 
equinox -- by taking these tasks on. All over the world, type2 listees 
would take the astronomical holiday, or the Saturday preceding, and fix 
little nit-picky things on their buses. Ideally, we will do this in 
groups. Those who care to imbibe will do so in measured amounts until the 
work is done. 

We can snail-mail and p-mail bus holiday greetings to each other. Vendors 
might remind us that &quot;there are only 65 shopping days before Spring 
equinox.&quot; Maybe we can even convince them to come up with special sales 
for the occasion, like EGR filters for $85.

We ought to decorate our buses for each event. Decoration can be grand or 
de minimus. Maybe a special origami whats-it for each of the four days, to 
hang from the rearview mirror.

Think of the collective karma! On the last weeks of March, June, 
September, and December we will know that we share the highways and 
byways with buses that are all in a little better condition than before!

And how deliciously anti-nationalist to celebrate four holidays a year in 
a particular way, instead of just one.

I don't know about y'all, but I am starting my Spring equinox wishlist 
right now.
