    needed some more propane... bought a cylinder tonight.
    upon the label was this message:

    &quot;Safety Notice
    Camping Heater Recall
    Bernzomatic Model TX-900 &amp; TX-900A
    Radiant Heaters Manufactured 1962-1966
    $250.00 refund
    see instructions on reverse side
    Carbon Monoxide Poisoning May Cause Death
    For Information Call:
    1-800-828-7611
    8 A.M. - 4:30 P.M. EST, Mon.-Fri.
    Stop Using These Camping Heaters....&quot;

    There is a depiction of a boxy-looking heater, round grille on the
front, handle on top...
    I see a lot of VW people using and displaying period camping
accessories at shows or wherever, so I thought I'd post it.
    Meanwhile, I will be on the lookout for these at yard sales... $250
would help cover the cost of a few parts.... ;)
    could someone who is on the bay list send it to them? thanks.
