'...people I trust tell me the KYB's are _at_$#% busters though, but perception 
is what U make of it, how old you and your kidneys are, etc.'

&gt;&gt;Maybe I just couldn't decide but I like the gas shocks on the back of
my '78 Westy 'cause it seems to actually raise the rear end a little and
I use the regular shocks up front.  The Gas-Adjust really does seem to
have a more jarring ride up front (so I switched). I don't notice it that
much on the rear end but it does seem more firm and corners all that weight
back there better.&lt;&lt;
