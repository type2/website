Subject: Multiplying Buses!!

Howdy all!!

I read awhile back on the list that VW Buses have a tendency to multiply
and it has happened to me!!! I'm a proud new owner of a 76 bus, and the
wife is starting to question my sanity. This was a deal I couldn't pass on,
I'm getting it for the price of getting it out of the impound lot. It has a
2.0 motor, with a/c and is in pretty good shape. I want to transfer the
engine to my 73 Westy, but I can't remember if you have to modify the
tranny. I remember seeing post awhile back, but was it for converting from
a 1600 to a 2.0 or for converting from a 1800 type 4 to a 2.0 ? Any help on
this would be greatly appreciated!!
