Subject: Re: [T2] EB Balloon Rides Anyone?

Here is another possibility. There are companies that specialize in aerial
photos using a mini blimp fitted with a remote control camera. I will try to
find out some names of companies. Does anyone know of any of these
companies.

Another possibility is a fellow in Wilmington may be flying up Friday night
in his plane. He is trying to work it out to drive up, but if he does fly,
I'll see what we can work out with him. He would probably do it for the cost
of fuel, but that is merely a guess.

Later,
