Hi,

&gt; I looked at the Bentley specs.  Is there any point in revving the engine
&gt; above the peak horsepower rating? 

 Yes.

&gt; ... If not, then it would appear I would get
&gt; no benefit from revving my 1976 FI stock engine above 4200 RPM?
&gt; Does this sound right?

 No: If you had a &quot;perfect&quot; transmission then you would always run the
engine at peak power when you want to accelerate and at peak torque
when cruising, the transmission would ensure that the engine and road
speeds correlated.

 Since we only have four gears we can't get close to this ideal and
have to run the engine at &quot;non-optimal&quot; speeds most of the time. In
the real world you get the best acceleration by exceeding the power
peak before upshifting because there is still more torque available
at the wheels in the current (low) gear than there would be in the
next (higher) gear. The time to upshift is (roughly) when the torque
available (at the wheels) in the higher gear exceeds that in your
current one, and that's usually well above the power peak.

 I'm simplifying quite a bit here: torque and power are directly
related and there's no point trying to apply torque to the
wheels if the engine isn't producing enough power to use it...
 In practice this doesn't matter much as the engine characteristics
and gear ratios are set up at the fatory, so you can have few 
choices.

Cheers,
	 W.
