Subject: Re: [T2] thoughts on converting FI to carb

Personally, other than wanting to tweak power out of carbs/motor
I can't see why you would want to change from FI to Carbs.
I have 2 motors, both FI, both run/ran great (one's getting a top
end rebuild), awesome fuel mileage, no issues.

But that's simply my thoughts...

In
&gt; &gt; other markets (including Germany) air cooled buses and vanagons never
&gt; &gt; received FI. Dual carbs until 1982. I am not sure about the
water-leakers
&gt; &gt; though.
