Subject: [T2] steering wheel alignment

Hey Everyone, I have what may be a silly question but
better safe than sorry.  Before yesterday my steering
wheel (when i was driving and going straight)has a bar
across it that was in the mostly horizontal position. 
Now, today when getting in it is was more at a 45
degree angle.  I'm under the impression that this is
not normal.  The only thing that happened between the
last time I drove her and today was that my roommate
moved it out of the driveway so she could get her car
out.  She didn't notice anything funny happening and
didn't notice what position the steering wheel was in.

Is this a problem?  what should I check out?

Thanks
Chrissie and Gertie ('78 Transporter)
