Most likely this is one of the three-wheeled things running around
with a motorcycle frontend and a VW rearend (tranny, etc).  Quite the
thing if you're into motorcycling, but have the need to carry
non-trivial amounts of stuff.

The only VW part of it would be the engine and probably the tranny.
But you don't have to pull the engine to do almost anything you want
to it....

        Dworkin, who'd have one if he could find insurance for it
