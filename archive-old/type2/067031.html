Subject: Re: Hidden Key &amp; Code

&gt; &gt;While replacing one of the large heater air hoses underneath my
&gt; &gt;'79 bus, a key with a metal tag attached to it dropped onto the
&gt; &gt;driveway.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I suppose that the dealer, or more likely, the factory, hid this
&gt; &gt;key and metal tag there.
At any rate, I'd like to see the results of the great hidden key 
search.

I have *never* found a key in that location while looking at/ taking apart
many a bus.     I have found more pipes in unlikely locations than hidden
keys, but I doubt the dealer put THEM there.  Owners manuals say the buses
came with two copies of the key, and it would not be unknown for a PO to hide
it somewhere in the bus, but that sounds like an awkward place to me.  

    The only  hidden spare key I ever found was in a 65 bus with a locking
steering coumn, and the owner lost the key, and his spare.  So Mike and I
went to remove the lock, which he had DESTROYED trying to get it to unlock.
 That is, he broke the cylinder, but that did not unlock the lock.   If you
lose your key, do not attempt to do anything to the cylinder.   And Sod's law
in force, it turned out that there was another ignition key stashed in a dash
crevice that I found.  But as the cylinder was broken, it was too late to use
the key.    : (   So FWIW there is a bus I know of with a locking column, w/o
lock, putting around Oly.
