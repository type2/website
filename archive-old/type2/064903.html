Subject: Attention: The New VVWCA Website

Hello Volkswagen Enthusiasts!

The Vintage Volkswagen Club of America is pleased
to announce its new *permanent* website.  This has
much more substance than the old temporary webpage
that we have been using primarily for application
distribution.  Here's the new site, let the links
begin!

New URL:      http://members.gnn_dot_com/vvwca  

Parts of the site are still under construction, but
it is still worth checking out.  Let us know what you
think!  8-)

Also, if you're an active VVWCA member and you haven't
heard from me on the net, please send me an email and
I'll get you on our online member list.  Thanks,

Jon Christensen        /V\      Membership Coordinator for the
~Certified VW Nut      \W/        Vintage VW Club of America 
vvwca_at_primenet_dot_com             Co-Editor of the VVWCA Newsletter
