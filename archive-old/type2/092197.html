Dave;
   From what she was describing it was much more than the normal cam
moving points bit. 

   She did put spare points in, but was having trouble re-installing the
dizzy, then called me when she discovered the severe binding.

   Haven't heard back from her yet. She does have a cell phone and is in
range of a tower at the moment.

   Hopefully one of the El Paso AIRS folks can give her a hand, I'm 600
miles away.

&gt; I wonder if the &quot;binding&quot; she is refering to is the normal
&gt; dist cam edges moving the points?

&gt; Does she have spare points?  Can she put them in?
&gt; 
&gt; Supposed to be one of the spares you carry in your emergency kit!
