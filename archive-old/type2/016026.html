George is right, Four years ago I did a top en overhaul, I misplaced a small 
bolt during the overhaul. About two years later I removed the sump plate, the 
one with the small hump in the middle and behold the bolt was protruding 
through an opening in the engine. its a good guess the PO broken a ring 
during an overhaul and a piece of a ring fell in the engine. I wouldn't worry 
about it if the engine is running OK.
