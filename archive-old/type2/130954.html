Subject: Painting Over Krylon

I bought a bus a few years back, removed the worst of the rust and sprayed 
it w/ krylon spray paint and topped that w/ krylon clear coat.  Now i 
decided to make it look right so I'm in the process of re-doing it.  Here's 
the problem.  I don't know if i didn't let the spray paint cure long enough 
before spraying the clear or what... but when you sand this stuff, it turns 
into bubble gum.  The paint does not sand off, it raises up into a rubbery 
substance and clogs sandpaper (all grits) almost immediately.  I just 
stipped one side of the bus to bare metal  ugh...  I used liquid stripper, 
then a sander.  It suct.  The other side is quite straight and I planned on 
scuffing it, priming it and spraying it...  I can't sand it down to prime 
on.  Any ideas that will save me from stripping the whole stinking thing.
