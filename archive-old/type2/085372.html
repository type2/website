&gt; My engine's out and in pieces, so I figured I might as well and pull and

You really need to look inside with a flashlight or when it's bright
outdoors.  I'm in the middle of doing mine; I've got so much sludge in the
tank that it's taking a long time but eventually coming clean.  See the
cleaning work in progess:

I've used lacquer thinner and Muratic acid (see your home depot pool
supplies section) to remove the rust and gunk. I've been using Marine Clean
to remove the sludge the built up in the tank; it's a microbial degreaser
and the only thing I found that works but you have to be patient.

My tank was so sludged that the 2 quarts that came in the tank repair kit I
bought weren't enough.  These pictures of the kit online are out of date:
you get 2 quarts not a gallon as depicted.

If you want the whole tank repair kit, I'd recommend getting the gallon of
Marine clean, the metal ready and sealer separately.  It's about the same
price but you get a whole gallon in case you need it.
