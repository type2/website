Subject: Double Relay to fuel Pump

Okay these are the pics from the post earlier this morning.

I checked the fuse and there was not one in there. I popped one in and 
turned the key on, no fuel pump. Went to the back popped the cover on the 
AFM operated the flap relay clicks but still no fuel pump.

Karl mentioned something about a fuse holder and three wires going into 
it(77 Westy Deluxe). One wire to the double relay one to the coil and one 
going to the backup light switch on the tranny. Now mine is definately 
different. One wire goes to the auxilary battery the other to the relay. I 
do have the black wire in the pic that goes to the coil straight from the 
relay.

The PO did however try to make his own wiring modifications. They were all 
reversible and easy. He just cross connected a few wires and unplugged a few 
near the Blower Fan. I don't know why he did it but if the fuse at the fan 
was in the fan stayed on continuously. It could not be operated by the 
control up front. Since I took the cross connections off it works properly 
now.

I promised my wife and myself that I wouldn't work on it any more until 
after we move. But like the listee that posted the other day...I keep 
finding myself cheating. I want to drive the old girl. She is like drugs and 
I can't leave her alone. Can anyone help me get a fix or talk me through 
withdrawal?
