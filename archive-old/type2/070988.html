Hi all! 

After a month off the list, i finally got signed back on. I took a trip to 
Germany, saw very few aircooled Vw's. Most of the buses i saw were high top 
campers. Pretty neat, but i can almost see more aircooled at my house than I 
saw in all of Germany!

Anyway, while I was gone my father (I leave my cars at my folks as they have 
the room to store them) decided to &quot;move&quot; my camper. Truth is he probably 
wanted to drive it. He's got it big for old muscle cars and won't abmit how 
cool the old VW's are, but each time I get one of mine out to play with it he 
gets this silly &quot;I wish I had one&quot; grin on his face!
Point is, while he was &quot;moving &quot; it he got it stuck in gear. 

Now what?
