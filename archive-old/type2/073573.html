Small hole on LEFT side, FIF.
Look at the RH exhaust port area; the muffler has a flange that comes
straight UP from the port and attaches to the heat riser. This side gets
the big hole gasket, as you want no restriction to flow here.
Left side exhaust port: notice that the leg from the heat riser connects to
a tube that reenters the muffler just ahead of the
tub where the fresh air hose connects - it sorta angles backwards, towards
the muffler. Little hole goes on this side, as you want to impede the flow
outta the riser somewhat. The flow of exhaust gasses out the LH exhaust
port will help pull the gasses through at the desired rate.
On contemplation, the small hole may not -restrict- flow at all ...
perhaps a venturi effect speeds it up!! Any physics majors on the list
wanna take a crack at it?
Either way, this setup  is the way the system was designed to work properly.

Please note that this is for modern engine/mufflers only - the 36 and 40 HP
crowd may have totally reversed situations for all know. Point to remember
is to follow the tubing to determine WHICH WAY flow is going R to L  or L
to R!

If you live in a VERY warm climate, you need to cut up a beer can and plug
the input side; think it overheats the fuel/air charge too much otherwise
(knock, vaporlock, i guess).

A good way to tell if a heat riser is plugged is to paint it with crappy
spraypaint... it will burn off as far up as you have free flow, up to a
point roughly near the middle (after that the gasses have cooled enough not
to cook many paints).
