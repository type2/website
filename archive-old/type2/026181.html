When I finally got done parking all the swappers and then browsing it and
got up to see the show, I too was disappointed in the late Bus turnout.  My
pre-show concentration was on getting out as many Type 3 Ghias as possible
and it seems to have succeeded.  Perhaps with the same dedication (calling
people, arranging other weekend events) the late Bus turnout would also be
respectable.

&gt; Just got back from the Spring Meet at Kelley Park.  A nice event put on by
&gt; the friendly people of the Golden Gate VVCA.
&gt; 
&gt; Seeming hundreds of Beetles in 5 classes.  Almost as many split window
&gt; busses, separated into working and luxury classes.  (I am almost tired of
&gt; 21
&gt; window 9 seaters.)  Ghias,  Notchbacks.
&gt; 
&gt; Only two T2's though.
&gt; 
&gt; My son took 2nd place with his 71 Dormobile.  Everybody who stopped by
&gt; loved
&gt; seeing it.
&gt; 
&gt; Where do late model busses show up in the SF bay area?  We would have
&gt; liked
&gt; some company.
