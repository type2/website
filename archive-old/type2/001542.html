I have installed a temp sensor from Gene Berg in my brand new Mexican 1600
longblock with stock carb and exhaust. It turns on my idiot oil light when
the temp reaches 218-225 degrees. Around town in stop and go traffic I have
no problem, but when I get on the highway and cruise for about 15 minutes at
55 mph, the light comes on. If I get off the highway and do more stop and go
driving under 45 mph it goes out. This new engine in my '70 Westy has about
300 miles on it. I want to drive it up I-35 from Ft. Worth to Kansas City
this week-end but can't do that with that red light staring me in the face.
This is driving me nuts because it's nicer and cool outside still. Any
ideas?
