Subject: VWoA locally is full of it, IMHO
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Well, when I inherited my '78 Westy, I immediately went to the local VW 
dealer (Houston) to get some replacement parts and was nearly laughed out of 
there.  Not only did they not have any in stock, they were completely 
uninterested in even trying to help me get any parts.

Maybe just my local dealership, maybe not.

I order thru Bus Depot or go down to BAP Geon to get local parts for my 
Westy.  Both are always very helpful.

Just my 2c worth.

Beth :o)
