&gt; Just recently replaced the type 4 engine in my '72 bus with a '71 type I
&gt;  engine.  However, there is a massive amount of space around the engine that
&gt;  needs to be sealed off to ensure proper cooling.  I've played around with
&gt;  different ideas, sheet metal, trying to find some fabricated tin, etc.  I
&gt;  had a brain storm last night and thought I'd get your advice.  What do 
y'all
&gt;  think of getting the rubber mat from the back seat area of the bus and
&gt;  cutting it to fit around engine and seal off compartment?  Wouldn't need
&gt;  much drilling and messing around with metal that I don't have or have money
&gt;  for.  Just thought I'd see what y'all thought about this idea.

Hi Michael,

I think you well end up regretting putting in a large piece of rubber as it 
could easily melt and overheat your engine, that's besides the risk of it 
catching on fire.

Personally I think your are wasting your time with fabrication when the 
genuine VW tin is still available from www.justkampers_dot_com from memory the 
rear tin is about $80 (no sales tax for export) plus shipping.

Good luck
