&lt;&lt; What are some obvious things to check for the battery
draining?
Could the broken fridge have something to do with it?
Thanks

You can confirm a draw on the battery by disconnecting the + terminal and 
putting an amp meter between the terminal and the post.  You should have no 
draw at all unless you have the radio turned on, or very slight one if you 
have a dash clock.  If you don't have an amp meter, the poor man's method is 
to touch the terminal to the post and see how much of a spark you get.  No 
draw, no spark.

If you find a slight current draw then you can further isolate it by having a 
helper pull one fuse at a time while you hold the meter.  

You most likely have a short somewhere.  

I doubt it is the frig.  That should be pulling from the 2nd. battery.  You 
should have a relay mounted on the left side on the engine compartment.  The 
relay could be stuck closed and could draw off your main battery.  You may 
want to make sure the frig is turned off and disconnect the spare battery to 
see if that is the problem.  You could also use your amp meter to check 
current flow from the 2nd. battery.
