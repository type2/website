Subject: Re: [T2] Solex jets for 2L's

Hi David,

Thanks for the info.

I just want an engine that won't run lean and cook my valves. I figured 
that since european T4 engines were sold with solexes that someone on 
this list would know the &quot;stock&quot; configuration I'm trying to recreate.

Eventually I want to FI this engine but for now the dual-carbs will get 
the bus back on the road.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;&gt; What's the jet size I need to refit a pair of solexes from a 1700 to

&gt;
&gt; They will work as is, but if you really want to jet them optimally for 
&gt; fuel mileage, I would go with the following:
&gt; 132.5 main
&gt; 170 Air Correction
&gt;
&gt; For a very safe-running engine that gets lousy mileage, try:
&gt; 137.5 main
&gt; 155 Air Correction
&gt;
&gt; 132.5 mains are not a common size but are available.  130 and 137.5 
&gt; are more widely available because they were &quot;stock&quot; sizes.
&gt; 170 Air Corrections are on the large side, to offset the increased 
&gt; displacement.
