Take a close look at the different rings.  You will find that the thicker
rings also have a different diameter than the thinner ones.  I don't
remember which is which, but they will fit only one way.  The rings to seal
the cylinder against the case must fit around the lower cylinder barrel.
The ring which seals the head will not fit around the barrel.

Sometimes the empirical approach works too
