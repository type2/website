*Someone noted that the Sundial pages from Josh Roger's archived site are no longer there; Ken
*pointed to the URL where they are archived and confirmed these are gone.

Ken, I brought down a complete copy of Josh's pages and archived them as did several other people. I have all of the sundial pages except for one image, which is corrupted in my copy; maybe it could even be repaired, but I don't think I can do it.

I'm copying Brad on this at the VWRogers address. Brad, I'll be happy to send you a set of the sundial pages all zipped up and ready to add to the library. Just let me know.

Thanks! Joe
