Subject: Re: It just died

Hi Oliver,

Same thing happened to me the first week I owned my bus (this was the summer of '89).  I used Muir's book to troubleshoot and decided it must be an electrical problem.  I jumped a wire from the regulator to the coil (NOT the points side of the coil), and my bus made it home.  The problem turned out to be not the ignition switch, as Muir suggested, but a PO fuse in the wire back from the switch to the coil.

Hope your problem is as satisfying to find and fix.

See you on the road,
Jerry
'70 bus

&gt; I was humming along at 70, as usual, and the bus just died. No noises.
&gt; Nuffin'! Just two red idiot lights on the dash. I had it flatbedded home.
So
&gt; far, I've changed the fuel filter and fuel pump. Where do I go next?
Double
&gt; relay? Pressure regualtor? Any adivice would be most welcome. This process
&gt; of elimination crapola is getting expensive. Thanx.
