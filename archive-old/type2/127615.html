Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Seized???

First take the spark plugs out, squirt some WD40 into
each cylinder, go under the bus with a big screwdriver
and at the flywheel teeth pry the engine back and
fourth till it limbers up enough for the starter to
turn it. Can't hurt to try this. And don't forget all
the safety stuff. Phil
