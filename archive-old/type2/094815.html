Subject: getting a &quot;new/old&quot; bus in the US

here is way that would work - but it would take a long time......

IF you know someone who lives in any European country, you could pay for the 
&quot;new&quot; bus and have it put in their name.

They would be allowed to ship the &quot;new&quot; bus over to the US  ( they can bring 
a camper/vehicle over to use on a vacation - requires special forms ect)

once the &quot;new&quot; bus is imported for their vacation here you start the 
PRETENDING..............the bus breaks down

PRETEND the bus breaks down and is left with &quot;you&quot; to fix/repair it.

THEN - you can file a &quot;mechanics lean.&quot;  Stating the vehicle was left there 
by a vacationing european.  You can say they decided fixing it was not worth 
the trouble and they flew home.  the state will then issue the &quot;mechanic&quot; 
(you) a title, regaurdless of year......

I know it is confusing but it will work!
