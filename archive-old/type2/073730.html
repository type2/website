Subject: Re: [T2] The journey of moisture and a change of heart about undercoating.

I hear you,David.
The undercoating inside the front wheel arches of
baywindows is responsible for more rust than possibly
any other factor with the possible exception of the
battery tray.
My 72 Single Cab has already had one piece of metal
welded into the passenger side wheel arch by a
previous owner &amp; the remaining undercoating has still
let in more water &amp; I'm going to have a fun
time(SARCASM!!) cutting out the rust where it's got
back through the pillar as far as the under tray
compartment.
You're right...there's lots of epoxy paints out there
these days &amp; other products designed to replace the
detrimental stuff VW put on there when they made them.
I wish you good luck with your task.
:-)
Cheers
Andrew Wood

&gt; Hello List,
&gt; 
&gt; I know it is not Friday but I think this topic is
&gt; ok.
&gt; I was in the process of cutting away the rocker
&gt; panel
&gt; on the driver's side of my bus today. I was actually
&gt; able to follow the path of the moisture that caused
&gt; a
&gt; holes in window sill, the floor, the beam underneath
&gt; and finially through the rocker panel in my bus. The
&gt; vent wing window's seal on the driver's side middle
&gt; window was splitting apart and the bottom of the
&gt; vent
&gt; window frame started rusting. This rusted a hole in
&gt; the window sill. Water then trickled into the bus
&gt; through this hole and collected on the floor under
&gt; the
&gt; rubber mat. It eventually rusted a hole through the
&gt; floor, then through the beam underneath and then
&gt; right
&gt; through the rocker panel. . Needless to say, I have
&gt; been busy with the grinder and welder.
&gt;  On another note. I want to change my suggestion
&gt; about
&gt; the undercoating. I mentioned the other day that I
&gt; had
&gt; worked in a body shop and had helped undercoat cars 
&gt; before. I had not seen what under coating does to
&gt; metal. The factory paint on the underside of my bus
&gt; is
&gt; dangerously thin. Undercoating does a horrible job
&gt; at
&gt; keeping moisture out, especially 28 year old
&gt; undercoating. After proding, probing, scraping, and
&gt; crying, I do not plan to undercoat the bottom of my
&gt; bus. Instead, I plan to section out the bottom of my
&gt; bus into small workable areas. I will strip each
&gt; section to the bare metal, remove all rust possible
&gt; and weld in metal when necessary, I will make sure
&gt; every thing in that section is sealed up, prep it
&gt; and
&gt; paint it with por 15. To do this, I will probably
&gt; put
&gt; the bus on a lift so I can get to all the hard to
&gt; reach areas and work on each section as I can afford
&gt; the por 15. For now however, I am just going to try
&gt; and fix the areas that have to do with the shell of
&gt; the vehicle. One thing at a time I guess. I just
&gt; thought I would share.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have a rust free bus, please, make sure your
&gt; windows doors and seals are properly sealed and make
&gt; sure you tend to rust holes before they cause others
&gt; to appear. they only get bigger with time.  Don't
&gt; wait
&gt; until they eat your bus alive.
&gt; Thanks for tolerating my rant.
&gt; 
&gt; Have a nice day,
&gt; David Kelly
&gt; From Wilmington, North Carolina
