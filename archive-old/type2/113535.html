Subject: Re: Fwd: [T2] Changing from Drums to Disc Brakes

Oh boy, Greg, I was going to respond to this but you said exactly what I 
would advise. A stock solution is several magnitudes more rational than ANY 
re-engineered swap for ANY street car. Use the engineering inherent in the 
design for a much lower time/money per mile ratio.
