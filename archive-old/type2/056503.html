Subject: Copolymer boot???

Hello all,

Just flipped through the COOL new search engine and failed to find anything
good concerning my boot frustration.

Have had my new German boots on for about 8 months and they are already
cracking :(

I want to go to a plastic one.  I thought I remember someone talking about
them and would love some advice.

Thanks,

Brian Allen
