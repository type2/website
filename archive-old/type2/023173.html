&gt;If you are looking for them call BFY at 714.639.4411
&gt;(tech assistance) or 800.789.0900 (order desk).  Their parts number
&gt;designation is 211 707 397C.  Cost is $8.00 for the pair.
&gt;I hope that helps somebody out there with their restoration.

For what it is worth, I have BFY to be really super as to meeting my needs
