&gt;Subject: [T2] WTB: '78 EEC Valve and EGR Valve
&gt;Date: Sat, 23 Mar 2002 20:13:22 -0800
&gt;
&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;I'm looking to buy an EEC valve. This is a vacuum controlled valve on the 
&gt;air filter assembly that controls whether fumes from the carbon cannister 
&gt;are sucked into the air filter or not. I had one go bad on me when I got my 
&gt;bus four years ago and replaced it with used oner. Now the replacement also 
&gt;leaks vacuum.
&gt;
&gt;If anyone has a spare they'd like to sell or any info on repairing the one 
&gt;I have, please let me know. On a properly working one, you can suck on a 
&gt;hose connected to the vacuum port and this will open/close the valve. You 
&gt;should not be able to suck air through continuously. If this is the case 
&gt;then the valve has become a vacuum leak (like mine).
&gt;
&gt;I'm also looking for an EGR valve.
&gt;
&gt;Any leads appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Mark
