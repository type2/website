Subject: Re: [T2] woodwork advice (westy cabinets) 


&gt; The birch veneer on my Westy's icebox and storage cabinet lids peeled and I
&gt; glued them back over the weekend and I also polished up the hinge because it
&gt; was tarnished.
&gt; 
&gt; I want to put the lids back on but the screw holes in the plywood are
&gt; &quot;stripped&quot;.  The threads on the screws weren't too heavy duty but there's
&gt; noting to hold the screws in the holes now except sawdust.
&gt; 
&gt; For you wood working pros out there, what's the best way to &quot;fix&quot; the holes
&gt; so the screws catch?

put a dab of glue on the end of a wooden match, stuff it in the screw hole,
and break it off flush with the surface.
