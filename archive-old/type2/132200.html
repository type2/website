&gt; It's interesting to look at the HP ratings of the similar engines.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess the combination of high compression ratio (domed pistons?) and
&gt; D-Jet in the Porsche variant of the engine was responsible for the
&gt; higher HP rating?

The porsche 2.0 pistons were either very slightly dished or flat. The 2.0
heads had bigger valves (42I 36E) and the cam was more aggressive.

The bus engines were severely de-tuned. It's actually pretty amazing that
the same engine was able to be used in such a wide variety of vehicles, but
the bus engines were some of the worst, especially as they get later model
year. The 1.8l carbed bus engine seems to have been the best configuration
for power and longevity.
