Subject: Bay window clock light bulb housing 68-73 grey faced clocks

I need the twist in bulb housing for my baywindow clock, does anyone know a
compatible guage or fixture this can be robbed from, considering other
clocks are not likely to be found, and shouldn't be robbed from? I would
like to consider a correct solution housing with tab, before I must give in
to mounting an lED in there.
Thanks,
Al
