Subject: 69 Bus rear crossmember and picture request

Hello Stephen,

I have a 69 Type 2 (sunroof, non Westy) that has been in the family since new.  
If I can get to it, I would like to do clutch replacement and fuel tank 
hygiene...  So it would be easy to answer your questions at that time. I'm 
getting ready to move from Maryland to South Carolina, so there are tons of 
things on my job list that will take precedence.  Where are you located, 
geographically speaking?  Is it possible you could come around and look?  OTOH, 
there must be guys on this List who could offer you the same opportunity??

Glenn

I just bought a 69 Westy and was wondering if anyone knew if you can get a rear
crossmember for a 69 aftermarket or will I just need to hunt around? Any ideas
where?  Also the PO fit a bigger engine in there and cut some metal out and I'm
not positive what is missing.  Does anyone have a good picture of the engine
compartment of a bus around 69 without the crossmember attached and maybe the
engine out?   Stephen
