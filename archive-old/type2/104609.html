From: &quot;scott lyons&quot; &lt;slyons_at_netrover_dot_com&gt;
&gt; This is a common filter for aftermarket carbs.
&gt; ... You can get a K&amp;N element that you never have to
&gt; replace, you just clean and re-oil it.

Thanks Scott (&amp; the others that answered),

I'll check out some of the local shops.  The filter element that's in there
now seems to be the usual paper and wire screen between two molded-on rubber
rings, top and bottom.

I'll look for that K&amp;N element first.  I'd prefer a reusable one if I can
get it.

Again, thanks, Everyone.
