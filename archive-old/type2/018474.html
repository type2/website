&gt; Testing at my injector, I get a solid light when turning over the engine (it's not firing). Is that the ballast resistor or the ECU's fault? or something in between. The brain needs a signal from the dizzy to tell it when to apply voltage, right? Maybe I've got something wired wrong there?
&gt; 
Eeek, I think that is usually the sign of a dead ECU :-(
Make sure you are testing correctly, i.e. one pin of your test lamp
should be in contact with one contact in the plug and the other pin
should be in contact with THE OTHER CONTACT IN THE PLUG and NOT ground
on the engine or body.  

If you have the meter hooked up like that, the test lamp should flicker
when you crank the engine.  The injectors receive power all the time the
ignition is on and they are grounded by the ECU.  If you have the test
lamp hooked up correctly and you are seeing a steady on test lamp, it
means your injectors are grounded and they are just happily spraying
fuel constantly.  

The ECU gets its rpm signal not from the distributor (you are thinking
D-Jetronic) but rather from a FI wiring harness connection to the ground
side of the coil, i.e. the side the condensor is connected to.  This is
a white wire.

As for the ballast resistors, you can check them directly with a
multimeter.  I believe the spec is about 6 ohms.  Check Bentley for the
procedure as far as which pins to test on.


&gt; And Sean, your description of Steve's problem is very close to my own. I keep thinking my ignition switch is worn out, but maybe it has something to do with wiring...or maybe that worn solenoid has some impact on the FI system...like maybe there's not enough voltage coming in to part of the FI system to trigger a critical event?
&gt; 

Hmm, could be an ignition switch problem, never thought of it that
way...

The fuel pump relay first knows to close when the solenoid/starter is
activated.  It knows this happens because there is an FI connection on
the solenoid and when the solenoid is energized, the fuel pump relay is
closed and the pump starts.

When you turn off the key and the engine has not started, the solenoid
is no longer energized and the fuel pump relay opens, pump stops.  I
wonder if it's possible to have some voltage &quot;leakage&quot; from the ignition
switch where it's not enough to trip the solenoid but it is enough to
close the fuel pump relay.  This is speculation on my part, I'm not even
sure if it's possible.  But in other words, the ignition switch still is
sending juice to the solenoid when it is off, maybe only a couple volts
but enough to juice the relay.  I'm thinking this might be possible on a
sufficiently worn switch, but maybe someone else can discredit that
theory.  To test this I suppose you could get under the van with a
voltmeter and measure the voltage at the solenoid from the ignition
switch wire with key in the &quot;on&quot; position.  You should read zero volts. 
If you read more than zero, the ignition switch is sending voltage when
it shouldn't be.  

Of course if this is what is happening, a way to confirm it would be to
try to start the engine, when it dies and fuel pump is still running,
get under and pull the ignition switch wire off the solenoid.  If the
pump then stops, you've found your problem, get a new ignition switch. 
Try this out, I just made it up and am curious to know if that might be
the problem :-)

Hope this helps
