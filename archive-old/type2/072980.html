Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie! You need to focus on the Cal buyers -- 72 and 73
oughta move because you don't have to smog anything prior to 74 (last I
checked). I was at my mechanic's once when a guy came in looking for a 73
to replace his 74 because he was tired of having to smog it, and obviously
73 is the newest pre-smog model you can get.

&gt;away 72 to 75 type 2's
