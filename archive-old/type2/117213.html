  Mexican bus story

I've been saving this until I could get pictures, but I don't know when 
I'll get around to that. Some of you know how slow I am to getting around 
to anything. 
There is a water cooled Mexican bus in VT sitting at John's Car Corner, a 
panel van. He has 2, an air-cooled 85 with a 1600 and a water-cooled 92 
with a 1.8L, both in pretty good condition. He got them from a lady from 
MA who had brought them up from Mexico and couldn't register them in MA 
(big surprise). John is planning on using them with his dealer plate. 

He had the idea that you could legally put them on the road in a state 
like VT or NH &quot;after a little red tape&quot; since there isn't emissions. I 
mentioned crash standards and he admitted there might be some details, 
getting them looked at by the DOT, but he pointed out that since they were 
panel vans they would be trucks as far as the DOT was concerned. I'm still 
not sure that would work.

I asked about parting the watercooled one out, I have some repaired front 
end damage to my 78 so I wouldn't be averse to grafting the 92 nose on 
mine. He said (and rightly so) that it was in way too good a shape to cut 
up.

I asked if  could take pictures of how the front end goes together and he 
said sure so eventually (don't hold your breath) I will post some photos 
online of exactly how that radiator assembly works. I looked at it from 
the outside and could NOT figure out how hot air exited the radiator. I am 
going to get some Vanagon seats from him so I'm hoping after I buy some 
stuff from him he won't mind if I want to carefully take things apart a 
bit, maybe write down some part numbers for mexibeetle to look for.

Until I go over there you now know everything I do.
