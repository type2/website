Subject: what's wrong with rust-oleum?

The nose on my bus has some surface rust on it.  I told a neighbor that I
was going to just sand primer and spray white rustoleum on in.  He said that
there is fish oil or something in the paint that will cause trouble in the
future when and if I spray some &quot;good&quot; paint.  Has anyone heard of such a
thing.  This isn't a show vehicle or anything just a good ride.  Thanks&lt;
Mark
