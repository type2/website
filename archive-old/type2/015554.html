Conversion of a T-I thermostatt requires just a bit of thought and not
beyond modest skills. The factory that made the T-IV item is no longer
functioning is what I heard. Same factory that supplies VW as far as I
know. We are dealing with a part about to become unobtainium. Even at $50,
they will be unavailable once VW runs out of current supply.
