The first time I posted this, I was typing while listening to my wife 
tell a story about work. Some errors crept in -- guess I can't walk and 
chew gum at the same time.

I added the &quot;(help!)&quot; because I haven't gotten any replies, and that 
seems to work for other people.

I checked the archives for this topic, and came away dissatisfied. If you
were constructing a floor for a camper, how would you do it?

- how many layers?
- of what materials?
- how thick?
- how would you bind the sides and front?
- what glue(s)
- what kind of top surface?

Real experience appreciated, but not absolutely necessary
