Subject: Printle Valves on FI loose. How bad is it? 

Ok, I THINK it's called the Printle Valve. I replaced my fuel lines last
week, and when I got to the little 2&quot; injector ones, they were crimped
on, so I found in the archives about cutting off the Ferrules (the
little crimpy ends)and that's gone well. But on my #2 cylinders
injector, while removing the rubber O-ring to replace it, I found that
the little end piece is loose. It's white, but stained brownish, either
plastic or ceramic, I can't tell which, and has a little 'needle' in the
center of it. It's the little Jet thingie. It slides in and out 1/8th to
1/4 inch. When it's all bolted back together it holds in snugg and
doesn't move.(the needle part never moves, just the cover) Is this going
to be an issue? And if it does need fixing, would something like JB-Weld
seal it up good enough? Or does it need replaced? My #1 seems good and
solid, and I didn't take out #'s 3 and 4 becouse the PO has apparently
already replaced those two. 

Kk, thanks in advance.
