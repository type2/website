&gt; I am researching an odd starting issue.  On an '82 aircooled FI, it doesn't
&gt; like to start cold.  Runs badly, needs a lot of throttle peddle, and tries
&gt; to die.  Act like an overfueling issue.  Once warm, it seems to run well.

have you checked the #2 sensor right next to the #3cyl. this has a single
wire coming off the top.
