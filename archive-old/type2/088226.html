Running straight 30 wt oil is certainly acceptable - it meets the viscosity
specifications for that year's vehicles for warm climates - and won't do any
harm.  I'm not aware, however, that different weights dino oil have
significant differences in engine cooling.  In these air-cooled engines the
most significant heat damage generally shows up in the cylinders and heads.
A straight-weight oil might give you a little more &quot;cushion&quot; when it comes
to oil thinning, but it's not going to save the engine from destruction.

Either fix your heat problem or slow down.

Subject: [T2] Using SAE30 in 2.0 FI with Hydraulic lifters...

&gt; I've been using 20-50 in my 77 with good results however, I just arrived
in
&gt; Tucson AZ a few days ago and despite driving through the night from San
&gt; Diego, the bus was just getting too hot to run over 52-53 mph. I'm
planning
&gt; on driving all the way to the east coast and would like to run at about
&gt; 60mph if I can keep the oil temp down. A local in Tucson recommended
running
&gt; straight 30. Would running this heavy of an oil be bad for the Hydraulic
&gt; lifters?
