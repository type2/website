&gt;i also need to know *what* to call that cast part on the rear wheel is...
&gt;[besides &quot;broken piece of sh*t&quot;  and *if* should i happen to find one in
&gt;the yard - how compatible it is between years... i'm looking.

the shock connects to the frame at the top and to a portion of this which
aims back and down from the center of the wheel.

is it the &quot;wheel cylinder&quot; - [an orderable part from Bus Depot]
