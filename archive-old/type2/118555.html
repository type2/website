Subject: Re: [T2] How do you check a hall sender unit? - was Cant get a
  spark?

&gt; Still can't get a spark, but I have isolated the the
 problem a little more.  Getting 12V to the coil, if i
 hook up a dwell meter to the spark plug wire from the
 coil (don't have a timing light right now) it jumps
 around so i think the dist. cap is getting spark, but
 there is NOT anything coming from the dist. to the
 spark plug wires.  I have an 83 Cal model with an
 electronic ignition.  Wondering if my hall sender is
 bad and how i can check it, or what else i might check
 as being the problem.  Thanks
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I run the Calif ignition on both my 77 Westy and my daughters 77 Westy. I have had it fail me twice on mine in
94,000 miles....both times it was the coil dying. I have never had the hall unit in the dizzy die nor the
module on the heatsink. I have seen bad hall units but only because the plastic rivet fell out of the holder
on the body of the dist and the hall cut thru the wires. The rivet [or push pin] stays in place unless you get
a little too energetic unplugging the harness, then it disappears and you don't realize it is missing....
Find a Rabbit or Audi with electronic ignition at a wrecking yard and get the coil from it. The early ones use
bus coils: you will find 211 905 115 B stamped into the bottom of it. [the later Rabbits/Golfs with the
locking connector on the hall unit uses the 211C coil]
I have a problem with the 68-79 Bentley: it says to use the 211 C coil but that is WRONG. The 211 B is the
correct coil. The 80-85 Vanagon Bentley does not give a part number...
