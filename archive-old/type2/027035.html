As I track down intermittent annoyances in my 68 camper I keep running 
across things I can't identify since this is my first vehicle with metric 
fasteners.

What's the size of the BIG steering wheel nut under the horn button?  Do I 
need a puller for the wheel after the nut is off?

Also, I am missing one screw on my turn signal collar.  I have figured out 
that the two screws that hold the switch in the housing match the collar 
screws, but I'm sure that the flaps and the hardware store here in town will 
not have these little buggers.  I looked at the nice diagrams at BUStedVW 
but it shows them as two different parts.  Illiustration 101, parts 18 and 
17.  I tried to copy the url to the specific frame but alas, the direct link 
is blocked, but the path I took is:
