Subject: Defrosting windshield, and other wintery things

Well, after my insane experience with my exhaust (see pics in links at
the end), I managed to get my hands on some nearly new heat
exchangers. However, it turns out they are from a Type4 CAR! ports
don't come close to lining up with my tinware. :(

Now, I don't *NEED* heat. I'm very warm blooded and don't mind driving
cold. The family can sit in the back seats and bundle up in blankets,
so they should be fine too. Though the wife will hate me all winter.
LoL!

But I do *NEED* a windshield defroster. Any suggestions (other than
Rain-X Anti-Fog)?

BTW: Aren't Type4 car HE's more rare than the 73 HE's that are stock
for my bus and available aftermarket?
