Subject: Re: [T2] undercoat-Cosmoline?

&gt; anyone hear of or have used Cosmoline?&lt;

I have heard, and delt with cosmoline before in the Navy. It is a thick,
dark, tarry substance that was used to protect metal objects in their
packages. I used to have to spend hours getting it out of the joints of
surgical instruments where cleanliness is paramount.

Of course, the word &quot;Cosmoline&quot; now brings nightmarish flashbacks of
inspectors breaking open my sterile surgical packs and rubbing the box
joints with a white muslin cloth. Always finding a hemostat that would yeild
a minute little black smudge requiring me to spend more hours trying to get
the damn stuff out of the box joints of stainless steel sugical instruments.
(which shouldn't need rust prevention in the first place)

Life without Cosmoline is good!!
