Subject: fuel pressure testing, take two

Well, after getting a fuel pressure tester from sears and realizing that
there aren't any threads on the VW test fitting, I am moving on to plan
two.  Does anyone know where to get schraeder valves at?  I'd like to
fit a piece of hose to the fuel pressure test fitting and then clamp a
valve onto that for a quick test setup.

I am guessing that it would need to be made for fuel? or would the car
tire ones be good enough?

Thanks,
Mike
