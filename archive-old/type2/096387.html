Subject: Technical Service Bulletins

While searching for VW info on the web, I came across this site.  The
company provides a search index for all technical service bulletins
published for any given make/model/year of vehicle, including Volkwagen
buses (listed as a truck):

http://www.alldata_dot_com/TSB/

I looked up my '79 bus and it appears that exactly 100 TSBs were released.
This seems like quite a wealth of information!  Problem is, this company
only provides bulletins from model years starting at 1982.  Has anyone
ever ordered these bulletins from Volkswagen?  Is there an easy way to
obtain them?
