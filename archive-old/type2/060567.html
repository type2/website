Subject: Rebuilt Starter

    It's after the fact but I'm curious. Just bought a rebuilt starter
from the FLAPS. Looked around and found rebuilt Bosch from $100 on up.
Even J.C. WhipMe was $80. Found one at Al's for $46 with a &quot;forever&quot;
warranty. It's built on a Bosch core but it looks like they cut a good
two or three inches of the length of the body (they tell me it's rebuilt
in the US somewhere). Works fine.
    Feedback?
