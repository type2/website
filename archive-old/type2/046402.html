&gt; I've taking the HUGE dive (ass backwards, I may add) into probably
&gt; rebuilding my 78 2 liter engine (with hydraulic lifters).
&gt;
&gt; I need parts. Buttloads of parts, like pushrod tubes and seals, pistons
and
&gt; cylinders and rings, blah blah blah.
&gt;
&gt; Where is there within, say, 150 miles of Sacramento that I can actually go
&gt; to and get parts easily and perhaps even inexpensively for this job? I
don't
&gt; want to do mail order - I have three weeks of vacation right now, and I
want
&gt; to get this done...
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
