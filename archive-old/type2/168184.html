Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Popped valve seat picture

Narrow, and using it to auto-adjust my VE table throughout so I was not trying to push it off stoich at any point.  Wide band is another wish list item.  What is your experience with it?  Is it not a bit scary to run lean with these air-cooled engines, due to the heat issue?

were you running a wbo2 or nbo2?  the nb will only keep you at stoich and that's it...
