&gt; On my visits to the USA I have made the following observations:

98% is a bit high.  I'd say that the number is more than 50%, though.
We've had the advantage of big engines that make the power wasted in a
torque converter tolerable.  There's no special license endorsement for
automatics, except in the case of handicapped drivers where they are often
required.

&gt; - taking a driving test seems to be a very simple procedure compared to the
&gt; very rigorous testing in Europe.

True.

&gt; - The 'hand-brake' on an automatic is often a foot-pedal. That makes it a
&gt; bit awkward in hill-starts.

Many US cars have a parking brake that is a foot pedal located off to the
left side of the footwell.  You can still use it for hill starts, as the
brake release is a pull-knob.
 
&gt; This explains why some of our American listees have problems driving their
&gt; manual buses.

I think that more of the problem is that the hand brakes aren't as
effective as they should be.  You really need them to be in good shape.
