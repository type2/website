Subject: Carb Replacement

I got the Weber progressive kit for my 82 Westy from Bus Depot they said it 
would fit.  It fit the engine nicely with a few minor mods to the throttle 
linkage.  It runs very well BUT
The engine cover doesn't fit. I don't want to butcher up the lid.  So if 
anyone has another model or doesn't mind cutting a hole in the engine cover I'm 
going to sell this so I can get the dual Webers instead.  Brand new, just test 
driven, will sacrifice for $200.
