Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Wheel bearing packing tool

George, just like your high school, ours has gone to a Technology Lab and I
no longer teach the welding, machine shop, auto mechanics and others like I
used to and liked to.  I think we may have made a mistake not teaching the
old hands on programs, they just want students to go to Votech classes.

This is why I put together a number of machines here at home, I really miss
working with the tools.

But for all of you who missed out on the good shop programs and would like
to do a little to your bus like some body repair or even paint, check at
your local Junior Colleges and see what they have to offer.  In both Kansas
City and Omaha a number of bus guys and girls are taking body repair in the
evenings for a really low fee and working on their own busses!!

 
&gt;&gt; By popular request, I am sending this info.  I love keeping these old busses
&gt;&gt; on the road and rear wheel bearings are expensive to replace in both time
&gt;&gt; and material.
&gt; 
&gt; Rick, have your students make these tools as a class project, sell them at
&gt; the shows, and use the money to finance that new NC machine for your
&gt; class!  :)
&gt; 
&gt; George &lt;-- too bad our school no longer has a metal shop...
