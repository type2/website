Somebody sez:

&gt;&gt; Went to the library to look at Josh's sundial pages and found them
&gt;&gt; missing. Are they gone forever?

Hmmm. Brad Beyer keeps Josh's original page on line here:

The Sundial stuff would have been under &quot;Campers&quot; but it does not seem to
have survived. I would guess it's in the archives, though, and if somebody
wants to rout it out of there we can put it in the Library, where there
already is a fairly extensive Campers section:

Speaking of, I put a picture of Josh on the Type2 Library Home Page:
