Subject: Re: Where do you work on your VW?

&gt;Right now I live in an apartment with an unheated, unlit, shared 
&gt;garage that is completely unsuitable for any sort of work or storage 
&gt;of my tools.  Hopefully, jobs allowing, we will be moving soon to a 
&gt;new place with a garage, but if not, I may have to rough it here for 
&gt;a while.  I'm curious what kind of rotten locations people have had 
&gt;to do resto or mechanical work on their VWs.  This was inspired by a 
&gt;story in VW trends that said the guy had painted his bug in a 
&gt;carport!  If I did that I would have a paintjob with 5000 bugs and 
&gt;chucnks of dirt in it.  Looked great though.
&gt;
&gt;So where do you do your work... and what methods have you used to get 
&gt;around cruddy working conditions?

I've worked on my bus and my bug in some pretty unaccomadating places.  
When I replaced my CVs, I did it in a parking lot, in mild rain, with no 
cover of any kind.  While I completed the job without undue trouble, it 
obviously sucked.  I bought a halogen worklight for $20 at a hardware 
store that casts a remarkable amount of light, and more importantly, 
provides a considerable amount of heat.  Sticking the light (which is 
less than a foot high) right next to where I work provides plenty of 
light and a good bit of heat (particularly if you accidently put your  
hand on the glass!)  I've found that, with the back hatch open to provide 
a workspace in the &quot;cargo area,&quot; I can do most jobs efficiently, if not 
in comfort.
