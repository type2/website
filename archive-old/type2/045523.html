???  ED is a FI engine, 1800, from August 74 to July 75. It has 93 mm bore.
2.0L is 94 mm bore.


&gt; Ohmigosh, Dave,
&gt;
&gt; My brain must have slipped a cog!!!  It is an ED. (which the rebuild
manual
&gt; sez is a 2.0 L. Wonder how long that mistake has persisted?  :-)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the shout.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers/Carron

&gt; &gt; Carron.... you indicate that your bus is a '75 with 1800 engine, but
your

one
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; my '71.... AE engines were used in bugs and busses.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  CB is the code for a 1700 engine, AW for a 1800.... possible typo?  or
&gt; else,  ya gots an engine different that somebody told ya.
