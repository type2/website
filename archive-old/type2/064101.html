 Hi, Jonathan- writing this on a friend's mailbox in Miami,
 Fla- you can foward this to the list if you like- we made it
 thru to Fla OK, but very hot.  The points got overheated and
 the rubbing block wore down to 70 deg. dwell and timing way
 retarded by Ft. Meyer's Fla; kew something wasn't right when
 milage was about 15!  Other than that bus has acted fine
 (over 170K miles); rattle is still there but hasn't
 changed.Had a great time on Sanibel Island; saw one other
 bus there.  Also sawe a neat beetle front with a rabbit
 engine conversion done by a VW guru in Ocala; the manifolds
 were custom made; I took some pictures.  This was a beetle
 turned into a truck with the flipup deck in back.  Heading
 on down to The Fla keys and then back- no-seeums leave nasty
 welts here, and getting into places to camp is easy since
 it's off season.  Had a nice time in North Carolina, take
 care now!  Mike Benthin in Miami now,,,,,,
