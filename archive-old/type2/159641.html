home depot has them even cheaper _at_ $21

I'm just wondering which size fan to go for.  Any ideas of the CFM flow
from the stock setup?  The 3&quot; version of the attwood fan above does
100CFM and the 4&quot; version does 125, but, it's also 1.3 more amps.  I
might give the 3&quot; ones a try and see what it's like...
