Subject: Re: [T2] Update - AIRS request for Susan Dolvin...

I am sorry but sometimes it seems to me that we can be kindest to people by
not being TOO helpful.  I think the best help in this case would be some
strong advice to get the bus to an import shop ASAP.  She really should not
unneccesarily risk being broken down. It is just so dangerous in this mean
world to be stuck on the side of a road, and I can hardly imagine anyone
driving a bus that distance in some of those middle-of-nowhere areas she'd
have passed through when the vehicle is not top notch!  It makes me quite
worried to hear these kinds of things.  Several AIRS requests I have seen
were of this nature and I am not sure we are doing any good by encouraging
it.  GW
