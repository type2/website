&gt; What's a wide five rim?   snip - you probably meant 5 lugs anyway.

Brian
the wide five rim does refer to the 5 lug bolts :

If you have an early bus or beetle that the wheels BOLT on,  with bolts,
and the five holes are really wide,,,That is the wide five.

 in comparison to the late Bus wheels that have NUTS that go on studs,,,
that also have five holes but are a smaller diameter circle than the wide
five rims
late beetle rims have bolts.. but are 4 &lt;lug&gt; hole rims
