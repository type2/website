Steve,
The type 1 case is far from the same alloy as a type 4! The type 1 case is
msostly magnesium, the type 4 case is pure aluminum alloy. When milling a
type 1 case, that boring bar cuts through the type 1 case like hot butter,
if you mill on a type 4, be prepared to change /sharpen the cutter head
after each spigot opening,

A good built type 4 will have that counterweight crank, and maybe even type
1 rod journals, and the same rods that you have in the type 1.

A type 4 engine is much better suited pulling the load of a heavy bus.No
matter how modified a type 1 just cannot make the grade for a period of
abuse that a bus puts the engine through. This is a general statement and
before some one says &quot;:My type 1 has 200 K on it&quot;. I would consider you a
veruy lucky person, and ask you to pick my next lottery numbers.

There are many myths about a type 4, and even a type 1, I build both engines
and can tell you that rarely do I ever see a type 1 powered bus, go past 40
K miles, and a type 4 can add 100,000 on that number....

My powerstroke engine allows take off from a stand still in 2nd gear, fully
loaded with 1500- almost 2,000 pounds of parts when we go to car shows. I
have successfully ascended the longest grade in the smokey mountains in 4th
gear, and passed an entire caravan of type 1 powered busses while doing it,
some of which were in 2nd gear, turning 5K . One of these busses was
equipped with a full BERG 2007 engine, he could not use his power, because,
&quot;it would get hot&quot;

Please do some more homework on the two engines, before you jump to
conclusions and compare them.You may want to start your research in a local
junkyard, see how many type 1 engines you see with rods through the case,
and compare that to the type 4's with the same problem...

All us aircooled guys are cut from the same mold, we should all be friends,
no matter what type engine we have. Some are type 1 guys, some are type 4,
and some are both, like me...BUt I will not have a bus with any type 1
engine installed in it..

&gt; Hmmm, all right you type 4 zealots just wait a minute ;-)  Remember we are
&gt; on the same air-cooled team here.
&gt;
&gt; Granted there aren't many of 'em out there but let's examine a
thoughtfully
&gt; modified type 1 engine (I hereby christen thee a T1-tm) on a par with a
type
&gt; 4, or maybe just as bullet proof.  Much of the increased longevity in a T4
&gt; is simply due to full flow filtering and better cooling...easily
&gt; accomplished on the T1. The case alloy is improved on the T4 although
later
&gt; new T1 cases use the same alloy.  Aside from a new case, you will not find
&gt; the following on your factory new T4 engine: counterweighted crank, cc'd
and
&gt; polished heads, rods balanced end to end within 1/4 gram, forged pistons
&gt; balanced to within 1/4 gram, and blueprinted assembly.  Did I mention
fully
&gt; counterweighted crank and the turbine-like smoothness and longevity it
adds?
&gt; You can balance a nickel on its edge next to the case split on a T1-tm at
&gt; idle rpm.
&gt;
&gt; Add to that a T4 oil cooler (easy mod to the doghouse), FF oil filtering,
&gt; *correctly installed and working thermostat* (one of my main beefs and one
&gt; reason for Walmart parking lot rebuilds in the first place), proper
&gt; breathing and carburetion, every engine seal in place and you've got
&gt; something only remotely similar to a stock T1. Depending on the choice of
&gt; displacement you've got a Bus that'll either pull a wheelie or be
&gt; *extremely* reliable and as peppy as any T4 within 2-300cc.
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately most shops treat the &quot;lowly&quot; T1 with less than it's due
&gt; respect and pay attention to only about 80% of the necessary detail in
what
&gt; I term a professional rebuild. These are the engines that have thermostats
&gt; left off, nothing is balanced, are incorrectly align bored, fuel filters
put
&gt; in the engine compartment etc.  Dang, I could go on for pages about the
&gt; abuses I've seen to T1 engines. These are the ones that don't live as
long.
&gt;
&gt; Shame on you who shun the elegance of a &quot;like the engineers intended it&quot;
&gt; rebuilt T1 or a T1-tm.  It's where you started from.

&gt; Yeah,
&gt; I will bring a few sets of tires, and see how  many I can burn until they
&gt; blow, before I run out of gas...Just for fun!!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Or maybe the type 4 guys can keep the cooler stocked while the type 1

&gt; &gt; &gt; are rebuilding the engine:)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Rick:
&gt; &gt; Yes, they could stock the cooler AND make parts runs, because, of
course,
&gt; their
&gt; &gt; buses would still be running and not NEED to be overhauled in the
parking
&gt; lot
&gt; &gt; at Walmart.
&gt; &gt; Oh, they've had their share of problems with type 4's, but it's still
the
&gt; best
&gt; &gt; bet.
