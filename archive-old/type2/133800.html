Subject: Insurance in California for 72 westy ?

I've been getting quotes for insurance for a 1972 Westy to be 
registered in San Francisco, CA.

I want only liability insurance only.  I expect the cost to be low 
since the vehicle is worth less than $1000.00

So far I've received the following quotes:

(all for 6 months of coverage)

Geico $511
Progressive $507
Allstate $360
State Farm $305

Do these seem reasonable?

Has anyone gotten a better deal with another carrier or are there any 
tricks out there?  i.e. &quot;motorhome insurance&quot; ?
