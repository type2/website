Subject: Re: [T2] oil froth / question

Thanks everyone who helped

Im not too paranoid now.  Im sure the moisture is burnt off now after my 
long trip.
I have another 8 hour drive tomorrow so it should be good.

I will check the flaps and the thermostat when i get home

&lt;phew!&gt;

Still running great!

James
