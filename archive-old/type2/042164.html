Sure,

Remanufactured and possibly also 'rebuilt' can mean that the USED item was
inspected and found to be OK, so it is cleaned and reused.  As an example if
there is a used axle and one joint is bad, but the other is OK, both joints will
be cleaned and repacked and the axle will be sold as 'remanufactured' or
'rebuilt'.  I do not consider this to be remanufactured or rebuilt.  My
definition would be that all tolerances are checked and made so that they conform
to a NEW part, not simply still in the tolerance band of a used part.  I expect
to get almost the same life out of a remanufactured or rebuilt part as a new
part, not just the rest of a used parts life

The question of NEW came up on the Vanagon posts, and long story short the guy
thought he ordered a NEW engine and got a junk yard one.  The vendor explained
that they don't sell new, just used, and referencing the ad in the catalog didn't
help customer, but the credit card company agreed with the customers
interpretation of the ad.

My advice is to always ask whether ALL (e.g. both CV joints, the boots, and the
axle) of the parts are NEW and if not, which are new and what has been done to
the others, if anything.  BTW, NEW should mean not used, damaged, or cosmetically
different than a factory part.  Anything different should be labeled as used,
damaged, or cosmetic defects (as are the diesel engines Parts Place advertises -
&quot;slightly damaged...but serviceable&quot;).  A used part is just that, used and we all
have similar expectations.  I found most vendors are pretty good when defining a
used part.

Last but not least, use a credit card.  The credit card company WILL support you
if your the product is not as advertised.  I would only pay cash if I new the
company/person well and realized that the only thing between a pile of metal and
a working part is the character of the person selling it.

&gt; Can you elaborate at all on how confusion might have existed between what is
&gt; considered a new and a rebuilt engine?
&gt;
&gt; Knowing the kinds of clarifying questions to ask in advance could help ALL of
&gt; us with future engine purchases with any vendor, wether diesel or gasoline!
