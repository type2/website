Subject: Re: [T2] Fan Shroud Flaps and the HE Covers

&gt;From: &quot;Vanagon Man&quot; One thing for certain.  I do not think the little flaps 
&gt;are that important,
&gt;but the cofers are, for anything like that lets air out, and when you need
&gt;heat in the winter, you want that air to come thru the heat exchangers into
&gt;the car.................any leak that you can fix now, do it.


Thanks Adam

I have had a few emails about this so far you are the only one who has put a 
name to them. &quot;cofer&quot; Great I am trying to get some of them now, I was also 
told that there is a left and a right. I have never seen what they look like 
I can only picture them in my Mind. I want to finish the engine this week 
and I am running out of time. So I might have to improvise for the time 
being. I was wondering about something though. If they only block in the air 
rushing into the Heat Exchangers for use in the winter for heat, and I leave 
this piece off to open air. During the summer when I close off the HEs, and 
the air is/would be stopped there. Seems like less would be forced onto the 
engine itself to cool it off? Or am I looking at it the wrong way. Seems 
that I should do something regaurdless of the season if this is the case.

Thanks,
