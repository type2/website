Subject: Re: [T2] Home made Poptop canvas

Thanks. Since the tent was a few years old already, once I installed  
everything I sprayed it down, inside and out, with some tent-sealer   
spray form a local camping shop. The first time I took it out was     
busses on the Blue Ridge Parkway a few years ago, and it POURED down  
rain. My bed was nice and toasty, however...                          
:)                                                                    
I would leave it a little slack, as otherwise I imagine you'd end up  
stretching it, which could lead to fatigue and tearing of the         
material.                                                             
                                                                      
&gt; That's a great looking tent Richard. How does it stand up in the    
&gt; weather, compared to other tent alternatives? Is there anything     
special                                                               
&gt; to watch out for, ie placement of seams? Is it better for the tent  
to be                                                                 
&gt; tight or a little slack?                                            
                                                                      
&gt; &gt; .there are several                                                
&gt; &gt; pictures of my set-up on my bus page, off

&gt; &gt; pretty easy project alltogether, and you get way bigger windows.
