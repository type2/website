&gt; I had the opportunity to drive a friend's 84 Westfalia about 100 miles on
&gt; Friday.  Was (sadly) amazed at how quiet and powerful that baby was.  Are
&gt; those water-cooled?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, the shifter had two problems.  It was awfully stiff, even after
&gt; warming up thoroughly.  Also, it didn't want to come out of (any) gear until
&gt; the rpm had dropped quite a bit, after pushing in on the clutch.  Went
&gt; *into* each gear just fine.  Are these typical of the Westy, or does my
&gt; friend have a problem just waiting to happen?

Sounds like his clutch is dragging. Probably bleeding the clutch slave 
would help, but it may be necessary to replace either the clutch slave
or master cylinders. An every 3 year occurance in damp climates and one
of the many disadvantages of the higher tech Vanagon over the low- tech
loaf and splittie. Bus Depot and others have these parts around $70
each, Dealers about $200 each.
