Subject: Compression Test 74 Bus

Good Friday all!

Compression test turned up some bad news - got lots of good advice  
(thanks all!): retorque the heads, and put oil in the cylinders and  
retest, will do this weekend. (#1 72, #2 80, #3 70, #4 90).  But to the  
point:

I got the 29.00 compression tester from Sears, it is a pain.

I will save four pages of explanation - I sure others have run into the  
problem.  It is like trying to put in and take out a spark plug without a  
spark plug socket that holds the spark plug in place during removal and  
insertion.

The solution is to have an adapter for the compression tester that is  
about 6 inches long and extends out of the shrouds- where the hose can be  
attached and detached.


Any thoughts?

Thanks very much!!

P.S.  I have perfected the art of extracting a small object thru the  
spark plug hole in the shroud with a coat-hanger!!  This will look  
excellent on a resume!
