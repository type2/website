Subject: Wanted: Drivers seat for '72 any reasonable condition... 

     Some of you may have seen my post last week offering up some brand new
upholstery for a 3/4 bench seat, Brand new in box. Well the story behind
that is: I purchased it from Bus Depot online and I thought I ordered a set
for the front bucket seats. In anticipation of the new upholstery ariving, I
stripped down my drivers seat.
    When the uphostery arrived, I was horrified to see that I ordered the
wrong item. Now, I am in need of a servicable (my standards are not too high
at this point, anything is an upgrade over bare springs)drivers seat until I
can off load the upholstery I bought and get the right upholstery.
    If anyone out there (preferably in the Connecticut area) has a drivers
seat in almost any condition, please drop me a line. I would even be
interested in the seat as a loaner)
Thanks for any help!
P.S. My wife is really anxious to drive &quot;her&quot; bus that has been unavailable
for over 6 long years.
