Subject: rebuild started! couple more things to do

so, after the invaluable help I received from list members regarding cam
indexing, valve timing, and distributor advance and retard (and vacuum and
so on) i discovered that my problem was the go wire - after sitting with
bentley and the fuel injection manual and a multimeter for an hour, and
thinking about the fact that it putted then stopped (which indicated to me
that it was getting a very little bit of gas, then being starved) and a half
i figured out that the fuel relay was getting power on the cold start
circuit (from the starter) but not the FI circuit (from the coil) and lo and
behold my frickin positive cable to the coil (from the relay) was tucked
into the wheel well... ah it's always the simple things...

anyway, got it running - spent the first five minutes of break-in (2000 RPM
for 20 minutes) biting my nails as noxious white smoke billowed out (stopped
and started and tightened until i realized it was coming from the exhaust
headers - cleaning crap burning off) - then it ran like a champ for the next
15 minutes with only occasional sputters, which i'm sure were due to my
original coil, distributor, and vacuum advance - runs good enough for the
moment but i'll probably replace all three of those within the year...

anyway, i have two oil leaks to address - i believe one from the seal
between the oil pump and the case, and the other the oil filter bracket
(i'll do some digging tomorrow morning)... once i get that done and reattach
the axles (cleaned and repacked the CV joints too - one had a slight bit of
scoring on the outer race but i didn't think it warranted replacement - at
least not yet... i might get one and keep it in the van in case of a
failure) and the heating bellows and cables i'll be ready to road test/road
breakin the van (whos is now named Lucy - came to me in a dream)

Before i do though i'll need to tune it - so i was wondering what people can
tell me about a good starting spot for the idle mixture? i know mine's
completely off kilter and i'll eventually bring it to be analyzed but to get
it idling and running, how many, say half turns, should i back the mixture
adjusting screw off of just to get it to idle? once i get it started i can
do the idle speed and timing...

thanks again for everyone's help!
