Subject: Re: [T2] Re: (T2) Long Mirror

&gt; &gt; &gt; i have been told that the rear end of the bus is sagging if the mirror
&gt; &gt; &gt; only shows the road directly behind you...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Which road would you like it to show ?

the kids in the back seat, use the outside mirrors to see what is behind
you on the road.......former bus driver (not the VW kind)
