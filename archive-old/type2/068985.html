I carry a pretty fair load of tools around with me too but there are a
couple I didn't see that I am never without.  I now have one of those
folding plier, knife, screwdriver, thingies (the all metal one) that doesn't
do a very good job of anything but get's by and fits anywhere.  I also keep
one of the ice-pick/bulb in handle electrical testers with me.  The one with
the really shapr point.  It slips thru the insulation or up into connectors
easily and gives me a quick go/no-go check of my electrical probs.  Keep a
piece of wood to stick over the end... corks won't cut it!
