&gt; An interresting thought occured to me as I tried to depart from a
wet and
&gt; muddy camp-out this morning.  &quot;I probably wouldn't be stuck in the
mud right
&gt; now if I had a winch mounted on the front of my bus,&quot; I mused.
&gt; 
&gt; Any of you volks ever consider, or actually undertake such a project

Not a bad idea, if you're sure to attach it to something sturdy.  The
front axle mounts are probably the closest hard points to the front.

I wouldn't trust the bumper mounts for this purpose.

Electrically, all you need is one heavy electrical cable from the
positive side of the battery to the winch.
