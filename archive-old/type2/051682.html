Subject: [T2] J tubes with BA6?

Now that I have fixed the problem with the BA6 heater the heat
exchangers -although new- are pretty weak. Since I am building a new 1776cc
engine for this bus should I bother to use them, or just fit 'J' tubes &amp;
rely on the booster fan to run the air supply to the cab? The flow is higher
when the engine is running, but this air could get contaminated in the H/E's
in the future, additionally the air hoses (1600dp upright) in the fan
housing could be capped to force more air over the engine &amp; not wasted on
heating me! (I know some heat is transferred away by the H/E's). Any
thoughts or experiences appreciated.

Andrew
