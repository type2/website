Subject: Fwd:  merc wheels

Hi,

&gt; Bus Boys indicates the mercedes wheels from the 70's - 80's
could/might
&gt; be the 15 inchers with the same bolt pattern as the 5 lug 14 inch bus
&gt; wheel...Any verification?

&lt;patient&gt;

 Yes, but there are several different styles of Merc wheel from this 
period (two decades) and (as someone pointed out) two different bus
bolt patterns for a 5 lug 14&quot; wheel. So this advice doesn't actually
help very much.
 Addressing the bolt pattern is just the first issue. Others are:

 (1) Strength
 (2) Offset
 (3) Bolt/stud clearance size
 (4) Nut/Bolt seat profile
 (5) Thickness of mounting surface
 (6) Hub centre clearance
 (7) Wheel nut clearance
 (8) Suspension/Brake clearance 
	(note the two nuts attaching composite rear drums on late bays)
 (9) Compatibility with spare wheel
(10) Availability of suitable tyres

&lt;/patient&gt;

 There are probably others I havn't even considered yet.

Cheers,
	W.
