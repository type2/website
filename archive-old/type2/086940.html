Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck during break pad replacementjob ( BOTTOM BLEEDER BOLT
 DOESN'T BLEED)

&gt; Hello.  I am new to the list and this is my first posting.  I am
&gt; replacing the brake pads on my 76 camper and am unable to get the break
&gt; pad closest to the outside of the wheel in place.  I think this is
&gt; because the bottom bleeder bolt isn't bleeding, so I can't get the &quot;I
&gt; don't know what it is called&quot; to compress.  Does anyone have any
&gt; suggestions as to what I can do to get this job done Thanks for your
&gt; time.

I usually push the piston back in using the old brake pad as the
&quot;thing&quot; that pushes em.. it is already lined up and I then us a small
wedge between the rotor and the brake pad to push em back it,
