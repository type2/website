Subject: Re: [Ball Joints]

Folks,
Just wanna say that i bit this chunk off too, but found that my mastication
capacity was smaller than what was required.

I broke an auger plate on my six ton press (small, i know) trying press one of
these bad boys out.

Closer inspection of the condition of my joints revealed good joints - they
were firm in their sockets and didn't grind or anything when you moved them
around. Also, my bus handled pretty well before i tore the frontend down, just
the balljoint boots were shot.

New joints will cost you about $17/ea from busdepot and the press job (have
this done at a shop that knows ACVW stuff) will run you at least $50.  Thats
about $120.  I spent 3.50/ea on ball joint boots from Busdepot (save your
clips - that are NLA i think) and slapped it all back together. Bus handles
fine and i sit higher in the seat cause my wallet is fatter!

If you're trippin about a ball joint coming apart on a mountain road and
killing you and your whole family -which is extremely unlikely, then do the
whole job right.

Anybody got a story of a late model bus b-joint coming apart?

My unsolicited .02,

clark

&gt; Having done this job myself recently, I can give you a heads up.  The very
first thing is an initial visual inspection of the ball joints. Put it on a
lift or crawl under there. Check the rubber boots. More than likely they will
be somewhat old-looking, but check to see if the boots are split on any of the
joints.  If so, there is probably grease everywhere - pretty obvious to spot. 
If that is the case then it will probably warrant replacement.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, how does your bus drive in crosswinds? A little &quot;sway&quot; should be
normal given the non-aerodynamic qualities of the vehicle, but if it seems
rather excessive/dangerous then it is probably time for new ball joints.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to attempt this job yourself then I highly suggest spending a
couple of hours perusing the archives on this subject.
