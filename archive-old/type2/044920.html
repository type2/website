My keys to survival on the road as a woman traveling alone: Assume you're
not safe anywhere; lock everything up. (Isn't that sad?) Stay aware. Have
several options for communications available; CB, cell phone, AIRS list.
Check in often. Ironically, I won't hesitate to call on volunteers for
assistance in an emergency, but I'm wary with strangers.

If someone asks me, &quot;Aren't you scared traveling alone?&quot; I get as far as
possible from that person as quickly as possible. That kind of thinking
just freaks me out. I don't need that energy in my space.

I don't carry weapons because I'm unsure of the legality of crossing state
lines with firearms, but my father did give me an NRA sticker to put on my
bus (I'm not a member, but he is). I do carry 10% (cop-strength) pepper
spray.

Toto, I don't think we're in the 70s anymore. I used to hitch-hike all over
SoCal with my dog, and having him with me saved me some trouble, I know it.

My heart breaks for Kristen and her family.

The kookiest cat anyone ever met. She will be missed.
