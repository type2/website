&gt; After taking in all the info about the rear wheel bearings I wanted to ask

For rear wheels, I find it easier to divide the torque desired by my
weight, multiply that by 12, measure that distance on the wrench from the
center of the socket, mark with tape, put socket on nut with handle
extending horizontally to my right, and to stand on the tape mark.
