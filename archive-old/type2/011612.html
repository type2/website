Is there some kind of hubcap tour thing goin on i
should know about:)(kidding)

hey everybody,
i think all should just take a deep breath and count
to 10.  as many have said this is all in fun and to
get bus folk together, not to get us to act like were
5 on the internet.   i mean its not like Jerry Garcia
is accompanying the hubcap around and youre waiting to
give HIM a ride.   we now know where the hubcap is
now, if some of our canadian busheads would still like
the opportunity to do the tour, then let it go east
again and then move itself west.   be it a week, a
month or a year, Nebraska should still be in the same
place as well as the rest of the west and we can enjoy
the passing of the hubcap then.   chris, you've done a
great job keeping it organized and maintaining an
email list and website.   thats all we can ask of you.
 there is no one to bitch at or about in this
situation, the best thing to do is move on.   Its
Friday BE HAPPY!!! 
have a relaxing weekend all.
