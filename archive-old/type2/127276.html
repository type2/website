&gt; Hello Guys     I have seen so many of the pertronix fail it is

I have a question for the list. several people have been running them
with little problem, and some have have horrible experiences with the
durn things. Who has bought one in the past, say 2 years or so and
have one fail? I have 3 in various stages of use and no failures.
