Subject: Oil pressure relocation - VDO kit - results

I asked around quite a bit. The VDO kit has been discontinued and all
the major suppliers are out of stock. However, Dave pointed me to John
at aircooled_dot_net. John does not have any right now either, but he has
stainless hoses made. Should be back in stock in a few weeks. It seems
as he is the only supplier for these right now. $19.99 for the kit.

BTW, the thread it 10mm which is very close to 1/8-27 but not the same.
