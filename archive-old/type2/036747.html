Darnnnnnn....... One year out.. I've been trying to get  my hands on a
manual for a 1969 kombi/bus/van.... Don't spose anyone has one they'd like
to sell do they?

Last night I lay in bed looking up at the stars in the sky
and I thought to myself, &quot;Where the heck is the ceiling?&quot;

Kind of beat-up and taped together, but intact and fun to look at if
