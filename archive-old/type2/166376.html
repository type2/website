Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon Alloys on a Bay

&gt;I have been told the correct procedure is to &quot;press out&quot; the existing studs
&gt;and then fit in the Vanagon OEM studs, which will accomodate the Alloys.
&gt; The owner of the tire store was not too familiar with the process.  I
&gt;couldn't find any description in the archives, other than the need for the
&gt;longer studs on the back and that the fronts would be OK.

This is a big job for the average tire store. The hub has to come off which means removal of the castle nut at the back (253 ft.lbs).

The old studs would have to be pressed out of the hub and the new ones pressed in. The studs have tapered splines on them to hold them in place.

&gt;Can anyone describe the process so I can relate it to the garage and watch
&gt;over my bus?  How much torque on the studs/nuts for Vanagon Alloys on a
&gt;Baywindow Westy?

The lug nuts for the steel wheels get 123 ft.lbs. in the rear. It seem like a lot but that's what Bentley says.

For the alloys with the cone shaped lug nuts isn't the torque much less? 80-90 ft. lbs that someone can confirm?
