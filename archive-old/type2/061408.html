Subject: Alternate Aux. Battery Locations

The '72 Riviera is destined to be one fine camping vehicle. With it's straight-up pop-top, it'll provide enough sleeping space for a small herd of campers.

I have a 12-volt fridge/cooker for it and a BN-4 gas heater. And that leads to a problem. The only place to mount the gas heater is in the engine compartment, which will force the sacrifice of a good spot for my auxiliary battery (required for my fridge).

I'm wondering if I can install the battery somewhere inside the cab and vent it to the outside of the bus (or into the engine compartment) to release gases when charging. Maybe that's even overkill. I just don't know much of anything about the gases released by batteries and the dangers thereof. Any insight would be appreciated.

If I can't come up with a good solution, I may investigate those propane heaters, especially since the stove will require propane too.

Thanks! Joe
