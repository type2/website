Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Parts ordering experience w/ 4 vendors

&gt; Of all the options you gave you left one out:
&gt; 
&gt; E) Use the shipping estimator but charge the actual shipping 
&gt; costs especially if it's much lower.

In cases where there is a tremendous difference (other than very small
orders, where our minimum charge applies) we sometimes do override. But
that just doesn't happen  often. In cases where it's not a tremendous
difference, we will not override, because we cannot afford to unless we
also do so in the reverse (i.e. up your charge by $10 the next time you
order a pair of brake drums). Like I said, over the long haul it
averages out about right, which is all we can do.

&gt; This is my gripe and I think Theodore's as well. What makes 
&gt; BD unique to many of the the other vendors is that you charge 
&gt; shipping based on the item cost (at least according to your 
&gt; printed catalog). It deters me from adding small items to the 
&gt; order because I know a small increase in price may 
&gt; drastically increase the shipping charges.

Actually, many vendors do it this way, not just us. 

But also, our catalog and are website do not calculate shipping the same
way. The catalog, for simplicity's sake, breaks the shipping rates into
chunks (i.e. for orders between $X and $Y, shipping a flat fee of $Z).
So you can theoretically add a $5 item that happens to move you into the
next tier and raises the shipping cost by $3 or whetever.

The website, however, is a bit more advanced. It still works off of a
percentage of selling price (with a set mimumum), but the actual amount
is continuously variable (so adding another $5 in parts will only raise
the shipping charge by maybe 30 cents; it can't jump you to &quot;another
tier&quot;). Also, it varies the rate slightly based on zip code. So it's a
bit more advanced, but still at best is only an approximation of actual
cost (as is all we can do, like I explained). 

&gt; The worst case is that if I order just lightweight items that 
&gt; end up costing a lot, like a poptop canvas, I feel the 
&gt; shipping charges are excessive compared to other vendors.

Yes, you're right that this is a good worst case example. A poptop
canvas is an example of an item where your shipping charge might indeed
exceed actual cost using our algorithm, because it's lightweight. By
comparison, if you ordered, say, brake shoes, you would probably pay
less for shipping than it cost us.

But let's look more closely at this worst-case example. Even in this
case, our delivered price is still the lowest. Out of curiosity, I just
tried ordering a poptop canvas on our site, and at the site of a
competitor who charges roughly the same price as we do (actually a bit
more because they don't offer a listmember discount).  To keep it fair,
I picked a destination zip code that was midpoint between us and them.
Surprise - our total delivered price was still about $6 lower!  In fact,
for their total price, we could have delivered it via 3-day air.  And
this is a worst-case scenario, because I picked an item that is
lightweight, and found a vendor whose price was close to ours (on many
items we're much cheaper). On a heavy item (or an order containing a
mixture of lightweight and heavier parts) you would have made out even
better under our shipping rates. (And remember that your listmember
discount will offset most of the shipping cost anyway.)

I don't think some people realize how expensive UPS shipping really is.
People get spoiled by places like Staples or Amazon that offer free or
very cheap delivery - something that they can afford to do for a number
of reasons, including profit margin, size (they can negotiate preferred
rates with UPS that a VW parts vendor like us will never get) and number
of nationwide warehouses (they can ship from the closest location to
you). If you look at the actual UPS costs of shipping a package, and
then factor in the hidden surcharges like dimensional/oversized weight,
insurance, residential delivery surcharge, and (I love this one!) &quot;fuel
surcharge,&quot; you'd be surprised. In fact UPS has raised their rates two
or three times in the last year alone!  Like I said, it's not our goal
to make money off of shipping charges, when averaged out. Only not to
lose money.
