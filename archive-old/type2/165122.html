Subject: Ooo-Ooh That SMELL!

Cantcha smell that SMELL?
My neighborhood has six duplexes; about 24 human
residents and quite possibly nearing 100 cats! The
tent that is my &quot;garage&quot; &quot;operating room&quot; etc. became
very attractive last winter as a dry, covered area
where the dirt was soft for easy digging and, well,
you can figure out the rest.

While Bussy was residing in the tent for most of the
past summer, engine-less, Many the hot day I would
open the rear hatch where I kept my tool box only to
be nearly overcome by the fumes of apparently rotting
flesh of some sort. I figured the cats had gone two
steps too far but was unable to locate the little
varmint that they had apparently left me...

One day that it was especially bad, it was also
excessively hot weather. I noticed that the towel that
I used to keep wiping my sweaty brow with stunk worse
than anything. I left it outside of the bus when I
buttoned it up for the night, and the next day the
stink was in the bus but totally gone from the towel.
This led me to concentrate my search where the towel
had been, and sure enough, that was where the smell
was worst.

Parked in that same corner of the rear deck was my
propane torch. I removed the propane torch from the
bus and most of the smell went away! Next hot weather
and it got bad again, but not in the same area. First
reaction: Damned Cats! Thought a bit, and under the
rear seat was a campstove propane bottle. The source
of the rotting flesh smell was my (not refilled)
propane bottles! -BaH
