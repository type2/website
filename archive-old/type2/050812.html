well this didn't happen to me, but to one of my new customers last year. they had no clutch pedal, so they towed it back to my shop(just a couple of miles). And tow it they did with a one year old Jeep Cherokee, and destoyed the rear bumper. While the bus was at my shop, it seemed, &quot;oh the clutch cable broke&quot;, NOT!! one of those cheap aftermarket wingnuts for the clutch cable walked it's way out. I replaced the wingnut with a good used oem, and sent the customers on their merry way after giving them their $25.00 bill.
