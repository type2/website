Subject: tuneup costs reasonable?
Message-Id: &lt;199905042237.PAA01664_at_coopext_dot_cahe.wsu_dot_edu&gt;

here in Pullman washington, I need to get a tuneup for my 70 westy bus.  I
called several places: $140-180 at one, a bit less at another, and at a
regular mechanic all-around-shop, over $300.  These prices are for valve
adjustment, tuneup, adjust card, replace pts, plugs, etc.  My question...
are these prices reasonable or outlandish?
I could stomache the $140 or so price, but at $300, I'd be willing to learn
real fast how to adjust the valves.  I can do a tuneup, but have difficulty
getting things running smoothly, and know little about carbeaution matters.
Thanks
Also, what could I expect for a sales price for this camper in fair-good
condition with sink ( no working faucet and no ice box), pop up and
sleeping hammocks, and good rear cushion.
