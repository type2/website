This I realize.  I've actually already done extensive soundproofing qualities
along Bulley's suggestions.  This has actually reduced the noise in the bus to
a level where I can actually hear the wind ripping over the pop-top roof,
especially on a gusty day.  Since the pop top hole is the only place on my roof
that isn't soundproofed, I was thinking that it might reduce the cabin noise in
this respect.
