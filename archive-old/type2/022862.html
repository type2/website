Vanagon experts:

I am new to many aspects of the Vanagon, and the latest project is stumping 
me...

First, I am new to this Vanagon and I only know some of it's history: It 
was originally
a European bus, delivered in Vienna, then it spent a few years on the 
Canary Islands before
being imported. Once in the states, it had the gas tank replaced in the 
near past.

The known: 1980 Vanagon, 2 liter air cooled engine with dual carbs 
(factory, it was European.)
The gas tank rusted out, so the little old lady that owned it took it to 
some guys who put in
a tank from a fuel injected bus (dual gas lines, drivers side one is 
blocked off) because that
is the only kind avail. in the states. But, ever since then it has leaked 
whenever topped
off, often a bunch (quart plus). So, I figured that one of the rubber 
grommets on the top was
bad or missing and dropped the tank. No rubber missing or bad. All 
crossover pipes in good
shape. Little hoses to the overflow tanks OK. Once the tank was out it was 
easy to tell
where the gas was leaking, from around the rubber grommet that the filler goes
through and into the tank. So, I put the plastic filler pipe in there and 
it was nice and snug. No
splits in the pipe or loose fits. (Level sender is also bad, but that is 
for another day...)
So, I put the tank back in the Vanagon, hook up all of the little hoses, 
etc. But, when I put the
filler pipe in the tank, it barely goes in before it is in too far to hook 
to the outside bracket
next to the passengers door. Like maybe 1/4 inch into the gasket. So, it 
would appear that
it is either too short or I am missing a piece. Plastic pipe goes through 
the rubber donut and into
the tank right now.
Are there different lengths of plastic filler pipe? (I don't know if it has 
been replaced, possibly.)
Were the early years different than the later years? The tank fits the 
brackets and
frame like it was made to go there...

I am at a loss. It would just seem that the filler pipe is too short. Now, 
the pipe is plastic.
Not known to shrink. Very puzzling.
