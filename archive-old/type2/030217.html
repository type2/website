&gt; Hi Volks.
&gt; I want to swap a dash, putting a 70 dash into my 69.
&gt; 
&gt; It looks like the padded vinyl part DOES NOT separate from the top metal 
&gt; part which goes forward to underneath the windshield.

No the das seperates into 2 padded vinyl sections seperate from the metal
top section.

&gt; I noticed two (or is it three?) large phillips screws on either side, in the 
&gt; front door posts, and a series of smaller screws in the top near the bottom 
&gt; edge of the windshield (screw heads covered by black plastic caps)
The lagre phillips screws yes. but there are a number of nuts behind the
top padded section that hold it to the metal top section. Maybe 10-12 the
screw parts are integral with the upper padded section.

&gt; I imagine you have to remove the steering wheel and column brace, e-brake 
&gt; lever too.

Not really just remove the fasteners that hold the items to the dash. the
steering column will just flop there.

Its not a bad job requires patience and contortionism. and a lot of wiring
removal, pull the glove box etc.
