Subject: Re: Stub axle...are they all the same?

Does anyone definitely know about this stub axle dilemma?  I could really
use the help :)

As a point of information, and to help Dan Burgos, does anyone know the
answer to the following question:

Are the 'loaf (68-79) and brick (80-&gt;) stub axles the same?
I am thinking that at least in the early years, the tranny was the same,
with differnt shifter mounting points, the CV's are the same, and I really
can't think of a reason to change the stub axle.  As a result, at least in
theory, a '68-79 axle might do the job, and, if so, I can fix him up.&gt;&gt;

Steve,
Assuming that the stub axle is the same '68-'79 and not '72-'79 (maybe a 
Type 4 thing?) I don't think there is any difference between the Bus and 
Vanagon stub axle.  It doesn't seem like they would change it since the 
rear brakes are pretty much the same (at least from about '76 up) as are 
the tranny, CVs, etc.  It would probably work.&gt;&gt;

I know it's not what you wanted to know but I was looking under a 
late model caravelle (Eurovan to you Nth Americans) on the hoist at 
my mechanic's workshop and I reckon that the CVs and drive shafts for 
this front wheel drive 5 cylinder diesel would swap straight into my 
72 bus.&gt;&gt;

Just a quick FYI.  RMMW lists the stub axle pn 211 501 265C for 71 to 79
buses AND 80 to 92 Vanagons.&gt;&gt;
