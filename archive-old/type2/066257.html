Subject: MAINTANANCE BOOK?

Hi there,

I'm Herbert from Holland and I have recently bought an '80 VW transporter
with 2 liter engine and I'm looking for a book about this engine. Can
anyone tell me where to find it because in Holland it is not obtainable.

As you probably know is petrol very expensive in Europe so I run my VW on
LPG-gas, wich is very cheap and most important, environment friendlier than
petrol.
What  I would like to know is if someone can give me some pointers about
the useage of LPG instead of petrol, do I need to run the engine regularly
on petrol to prevent excesive wearing of the engine?

Further more I noticed that the engine does not have so much power you
would expect of a 2 liter, it runs okay but is slow on acceleration (also
when I run it on petrol).  Who can tell me why?

So you see why I need to have a manuel. Hope someone can help me.

Thanx...
