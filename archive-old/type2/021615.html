why don't you take it off and bend it away so it can't touch the
contacts?  I don't know if this will actually work, or if space allows,
but it's just an idea :)

&gt; Dear List,
&gt; 
&gt; The archives won't let me access anything at the moment, although the search
&gt; function calls up the first few lines on many promising postings.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe I have found the source of my mysterious alternator/battery
&gt; problem.  It appears that the cover is shorting out one of the B+ terminals.
&gt; There is a post from David S. from Feb 200 that I printed out ans saved that
&gt; refers to the &quot;rectangular fiber insulation.&quot;  (Thanks David)  I can't
&gt; figure out how that (which I have now snapped in half) is supposed to
&gt; insulate the terminal.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't want to put electrical tape in there;  too hot and I'm afraid of
&gt; what will happen if (when) it comes loose.  The best I've thought of was
&gt; several coats of liquid electrical tape.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions welcomed.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
