Subject: My Breaking Points

Roughly 6000 miles ago I changed the points in The Mothership.  Today 
that set of points broke under the pressure.  They didn't burn, they 
broke.

I went out this morning, loaded my kayak (KIWI Stealth) on the roof 
rack, and my trolling motor and battery in the cargo flloor.  Today 
was meant for the river even though the water and the air is a bit 
chilly.  Some things just have to be priorities.  : )

I figured I would let the Mother warm while I toiled and labored.  I 
stepped around to the drivers side door stuck my body in and put the 
key in the ignition.  Still standing outside the bus I turned the key 
and pressed the Gibson button.  The Mothership fired right up.

I let her run at her own idle while I listened (as usual) and 
completed some chores.  I finished them in about 5 minutes and got in 
the drivers seat.  I tapped the gas, revved her just a pinch, then a 
little more, then she died like a brick dropped in a pond.  That 
eminent sound of nothing we all dread and hate when it happens.  Oh 
the mystery of it all that stands before us!

Getting over my panic as rapidly as my anxiety would subside I 
ascertained the death was too quick to be the fuel system.  Knowing 
they were elderly and needed to be changed, I went straight for the 
points.  I got one my five 10mm wrenches from the toolbox filled with 
unmatched assorted tools.  Unmatched but reasonably complete.

I sat on my ammo box emergency camping kit and popped the cap on the 
dizzy.  I pulled the vaccum hose from the advance.  I pulled the 
green condensor wire from the coil and slid it through the fan 
housing hole.   I don't have a timming light and don't know how to 
static time I noted exactly where the vaccum advance module was 
pointing.

Loosening the 10 mm lock nut just under and partially hidden by the 
dizzy, I eventually got it loose enough to wiggle the distributor out 
of its settlement.  I extracted the part with reasonable ease.

I looked at the points and they were not burned at all.  Much to my 
surprise the plastic knock that settles against the distributor shaft 
and opens and closes the points, had broken from wear.  I found the 
piece laying in the mechanism.

I took out my spare distributor already set up complete with new 
points at the proper gap (.018) and inspected it.  All looked fine so 
I slid it in.  I set it to my reference point, hooked up my wiring 
the reverse of how I had removed it, checked my work again, and 
stepped up to crank the bus.

The Mother fired on the first turn and ran perfect.  I let it warm up 
then tweaked the timing as best as I could by ear.  She is running 
good.  No skips, no jerks, and a cool running engine.

Now I am not much of a motorhead.  I would be lost on any thing other 
than minor repairs, but I remember a time I was totally lost on my 
bus and it's workings.  Many of you remember those times too.  Carry 
spares folks.  They can help speed up minor fixes that we all are 
bound to suffer.

Hope this helps in some way,

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings,
Charlie Ford
