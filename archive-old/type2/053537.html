Subject: Emergency Brake

I'm fairly new to my VW bus, and I'm curious, should my parking brake 
actually work on a hill? I live on a fairly steep hill and just the parking 
brake is not enough, I also have to put it in gear. The brakes were 
compeletely rebuilt just before I bought the bus. And I'm pulling the brake 
pretty hard. So is this just a design flaw, or do I need to do some brake 
work? The bible says the parking brake only uses the front brake pads of the 
rear brakes. Doesn't sound like much.
