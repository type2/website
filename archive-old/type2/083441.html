This is a story from my grandad, so take it for what it's worth. He
simply poured kerosene in the plugs (not a lot, you don't want to
liquid lock the piston) let it set for a few days. Later he went out
and just worked the flywheel back n forth. Broke loose. Story goes he
put another 100k miles on that engine. Note this is on an old v8 ford,
so the position of the pistons were much more reasonable for this than
a h4 vw engine :)

&gt; Got plenty of time; so what would anyone recommend for &quot;unsticking&quot;
&gt; an engine that's been sitting for (?) long? Anything to pour into the

&gt; in similar condition, so info/experience with either would be appreci-
