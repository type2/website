Nicholas:

I think you need to take the vehicle to another test station and try again.
In some cases I've had inspectors actually test the EGR and in other cases
I've had them just look to see that it's there.

I'm not sure where you started from when you &quot;pushed the valve all the way
to the full throttle position, the engine
speed would rise,&quot;  but the test the inspectors perform (I think) is to
disconnect the linkage and then move the arm on the EGR to the &quot;mid
throttle&quot; position; the engine speed should *drop* indicating exhaust gas is
being re-circulated.  The EGR valve should not allow exhaust gas to enter at
idle and at WOT.

&gt; 1977 Stock 2L, AFC FI, EGR filter recently added.
&gt;
&gt; So I took my bus into the test station today to get it smogged, and the
&gt; guy informed me that my EGR system is not working right, and he would not
&gt; test it. (I know that it will pass the sniffer, as I just had the CO
&gt; adjusted.)
&gt;
&gt; He held his hand on the EGR recirculation pipe in the engine bay, and said
&gt; that it was not hot enough, so the EGR system must not be operating
&gt; properly. I pointed out that if I disconeccted the link to the throttle,
&gt; and pushed the valve all the way to the full throttle position, the engine
&gt; speed would rise indicating that the exhaust gas is no longer being
&gt; recirculated. (However moving the lever on the EGR valve all the way to
&gt; the left does not cause the engine speed to rise as expected, which
&gt; indicates that _something_ is wrong with it.)
&gt;
&gt; He would not test it, and said I have to have it fixed first. I am
&gt; thinking about taking it somewhere else, as my feeling is that he just
&gt; didn't want to test it today as it was close to closing time. However I
&gt; would like to have it working right if possible.
&gt;
&gt; I know that the EGR valve is NLA, however I am wondering what I should do.
&gt; Is there any way to service the EGR valve? If it is working right does
&gt; that pipe get really hot like he indicated. Should I try replacing it
&gt; with one from a junk yard?
&gt;
&gt; Any advice would be much appreciated.
&gt;
