Don't know the answer to this one but I did find a book at the library on
how to make your own camping equipment. Seemed kinda old (relatively I
guess...I'm 26 and it was older than me I think) but it told you how to make
various types of clothing and packs and even tents. It did list suppliers
for fabric etc, but I don't know if they even exist anymore. The book also
told you how to sew the difficult fabrics with a sewing machine (nylon being
a real PITA) and do the right hems, waterproofing seams and zippers. It
seemed that it would be do-able to alter an existing tent as long as it was
tall enough and not a dome tent? You might want to look up a book like this
at your library.... couldn't find one on the online book sites.
