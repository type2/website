Subject: Re: [T2] 1700 upgrade to 2000, difficulties

&gt;From: scott lyons &gt; Would the rods, crank and cam be suitable for use 
&gt;without modification?

&gt;cam is interchangeable, sort of.

Sort of? Sounds like I need to change out everything in order to upgrade 
this one, but what does that mean, just curious.
