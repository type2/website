Subject: Replaced head,... leaks

My freshly installed rebuilt head did not seat properly or I needed a
gasket or, I'm just not sure.  What I do know is that the replaced head
did not have a gasket/seal installed previously. Do I need to retorque the
head? Perhaps I needed to take some measurements beforehand to determine
the fit.

One nice thing is that the engine need not be dropped for the procedure to
happen again. Just lower and tilt. I have an 81' Vanagon. The reason I
replaced it was that the # 1 exhaust valve lost its seat.

Can anyone provide me with some insight and suggestions? Thanks in advance.

Craig
