Subject: Single Cab Side and Tail Gates $100, SF Bay Area

        Volks,
        Bren Smith and I finally met this weekend- He's even nicer
in person than email suggests, which is pretty common to members of
this list... And we've put together a neat deal for someone with
a pickup truck (5x-79) who needs side and rear gates: 

        My extra off-white side gates and his extra grey-primer over ?? 
rear-gate, all rough-but-usable. A complete set for someone's pickup truck:

        $100.00 Or Best Offer. What a deal!

        I'll take a picture or two on the current roll of film, if someone
wants to view them without coming for a visit.

        All three pieces bear several coats of paint. The bottom-edges of 
the side gates have rust perforations  but were working when removed from 
my single cab to make way for the NOS gates I have now. If the DPO hadn't 
found NOS gates, I'd be using these now, and would have bought Bren's tail-
gate to complete the set!

        Since Bren has a complete set of gates for his double cab and
I have a complete set for my single, we figure these extras should go to
someone who could use them.

        Cheers!
