Subject: ALL of the Aerial Flyover PICS from HCBF !

hey VOLKS:

Sorry it took me so long to get these posted, but I just got the masters 
myself last week

ALL of the aerial photos, including the human vw logo that was already 
posted are available to see and order at:

http://www.shutterfly_dot_com/pro/MMyers/HighCountryBusFest
(click on the folder and navigate through the pics)

This is a pretty good service.  You can order prints directly from them and 
use your credit card.

These images are HIGH resolution and prints look great at 8x10, 11x14, 
16x20, 20x30.
I have already printed a few 20x30's for myself and they look great.

If you want to order prints you will need to register.

IF YOU WANT TO VIEW THE PICS ONLY, you don't need to register.

Thanks for your support,  the proceeds from these print sales will go to pay 
for hiring of the aerial photographer and print shipping services.

take care,
gobusgo
