Subject: no wipers and its raining:(

Hey now!
            My wipers are not working.  Friday on our way home from work (me 
and my bus that is) it started to rain so turned  on the wipers.  BUT i had 
my ladder on top and a rope securing it to the spare tire.  The wipers got 
tangled up in the rope. AHHHHHH.  I stopped and untangled and the wouldn't 
work.  The motor is running when I turn the wipers on, but the arms wont 
move. They struggle to move and will only move with assistance. If I take 
them off the windshield they move just fine. 
Any ideas?
