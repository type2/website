Subject: Heater control

Greetings,
I have been having some trouble with the heating system in my 82 vanagon.  
Hot air blowing in all the time, no matter what the levers are set at.  The 
cable is attached correctly to the temp. control lever, so I am thinking the 
next step is to check if this lever is moving the proper flap in the heater 
and ventilation housing.  Does this lever (second from top) control the 
&quot;main cut-off flap&quot; in the housing, another flap in the housing, or perhaps 
is it connected to the temp control unit back by the engine?

I'm sure this is a comon spring time question due to the fear of constant 
heat all summer, but I could not find an answer in the archives.  Any help 
would be appreciated.
