Subject: Re: [VB] Oil Filler cap gasket

The Brazilian caps are real cheap but the one I bought doesn't fit. The clip
inside the cap seems to be shaped incorrectly. The cork gaskets used to be
available. Haven't tried to get the new gasket off the Brazilian cap.

Phil


&gt; The cork just fell off of my 71's oil filler cap, can you just order the
&gt; cork from somewhere or do you have to buy a new cap?  And if so, do the
&gt; aftermarket ones fit well?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Snoopy
