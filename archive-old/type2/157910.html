Subject: Re: [T2] which is better?

More is better. The 5 rib. Trust me on this!

A few years back I bought a used engine and a used
5-rib (091) transaxle for $250 each. At the time I was
quoted by another wrecking yard &quot;...we'll throw an
engine together for you - whatever you want for $100
but we have to have $750 for the 091...&quot; -BaH

 Hi,
 
 I have two manual transmissions that I have taken
 out of two different '73
 Bays that I own - both start with 002, but one is a
 3 rib and one is a 5
 rib. If both work equally well - which one would be
 a better choice for
 highway driving? or do they have the same gearing?
