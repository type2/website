If you run out and the engine dies and pull over no big deal. If you
continually try to start the bus knowing there is no gas then you could
damage the pump: the motor is suspended in the fuel and is both cooled and
lubricated by it.

Someone once reported that they melted the injector seals during some engine
testing. Who was that?
