Double check the points to make sure the gap is still there (meaning it 
didn't close) and if so is there fire in the hole (so to speak).  Next check 
the condenser, sometimes best done by replacement.  Make sure all wires are 
still attached, as sometimes just the right hit disables their electric 
carrying capabilities.  If all is good there write back.
