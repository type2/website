Subject: Rust Converter Question
Message-Id: &lt;2.2.32.19990523132050.006cd310_at_texoma_dot_net&gt;

I've been prepping some parts as I do the metal work on my '68 crewcab with
&quot;Metal Ready&quot;, a rust conversion product similar to Jasco Prep N Prime.  The
instructions for both say to put their product on, then after drying (24 hrs
I think), to rinse with water then paint.

Some areas I'm doing are not that easy to get to and I'm not anxious to
re-introduce water into these areas to possibly set up the next rust cycle.
Does anyone know of any problems if I just spray the metal ready stuff in
these areas, followed by paint (at the right time) - is there an adhesion
problem, or would stuff like Rustoleum work just fine?

Thanks,
Dean
