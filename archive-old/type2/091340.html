&gt; I think I've observed an oddity with my hydraulic lifters. My parking

&gt; Am I smoking crack or does the oil pool up in the sump facing downhill

Well, you have to answer the first question yourself (feel free to take
the fifth :-) As for the second, I think (NOTE: I'm weaseling!) that
whether your lifters drain down or not depends on where the hole in the
lifter is pointed.  If you look at a hydraulic lifter, there is a hole in
the side for oil to enter.  If that hole points down, the lifter can drain
thru it and you get clatter.  Ideally, the hole points up, and you are
supposed to install them that way, but since the lifters are free to
rotate in the bore, I have no clue as to how to keep them from pointing
down by times.  It sounds like one or more of your lifters has the hole
pointed such that when you park on one angle it drains but on the other it
does not.  This is *not* a major worry :-)

A separate problem that may be occurring, tho is.... what is your oil
light/pressure doing during this performance?  Is it on or off?  If it is
on and the engine clatters 'til your oil pump regains its prime, then the
problem is more serious.  My theory on this is that it is time to replace
your (oil and) filter with a better filter.  some filters seem to let the
oil pump drain overnight and it takes 3-10 seconds for the pump to reprime
itself.  This is not good and should be avoided.
