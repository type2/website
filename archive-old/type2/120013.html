Hi everyone. Maureen, and I are traveling through
Monterey Ca, and
lost all the gears in our tranny. We have a place to
stay with
friends, but need a tranny to get back to Canada for
Christmas. We
are driving a '65 bus converted to I.R.S. If some one
has a used
tranny for sale ready to go into a bus, or a good
reduction box
tranny, I would be willing to switch back to the
original setup. If
we go this route I could trade the rear disc brake
setup (porsche 914
rotors, jetta calipers), or some kind of part trade.
The bus is
stranded in the Del Monte Mall, at the Munras exit. I
will check the
internet from time to time. I will also leave a couple
of phone
numbers...cell 1-604-785-6846, friend Mike
831-657-9404. Thank you.
Jason Radawiec
