Subject: Re: [T2] Need a brake fluid reseviour for 68 bus

&gt;   My fix didn't stand up to the rigors of brake fluid.  Now I am
back to
&gt; square one, no reseviour.  I don't have a parts bus nearby, does
anyone
&gt; have a spare to sell me?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks a bunch,
&gt; Jennifer

Jennifer,
    While I don't know what is wrong with your reservoir, I can tell
you how I fixed mine.  When we bought our 71 the fill reservoir had a
crack in it.  I couldn't find a new or used one anyplace at the time I
needed it so I decided to repair what I had.  First thing to do is
remove  and thoroughly clean the reservoir inside and out.  Make the
last of the cleaning a rinse with plain water and then let it dry
totally.  Then I used a hot soldering iron with a brand new tip to
melt the plastic around the crack and seal it up.  I just held the tip
to the plastic and slowly swirled it over the crack to move the
plastic around.  It was kind of like welding the plastic.  It's 1
month shy of 4 years since I did that, and it still holds without a
leak.
