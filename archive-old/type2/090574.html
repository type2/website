Subject: Re: [T2] RE:  914 motor into a bus (was 0mile engine)

Hello List,

When I went I bought the 2L 914 motor earlier this
week, I asked the garage owner what the differences
were between a bus 2L and a 914 2L. He started looking
up and comparing vw part numbers and found that 914 2L
pistons and 2L bus pistons were different. Can any one
verify this? If so, does any one know if the Porsche
pistons were dished or different in any way? It is
possible that he was mistaken but I wanted to check.
If they are different, would they be part of the
reason that the compression ratio is higher?
BTW, he did also note the difference in the heads when
he looked up the numbers. 

I also asked him a couple of test questions. I asked
him if he has ever had any experience with GEX. He was
quick to warn me of their shoddy practices and lurring
magazine adds. He didn't like what he saw of GEX
products. I also asked him what type of spark plugs,
ect he used. He likes Bosch. I know this doesn't say
much of his practices but it gave me alittle more
confidence in the engine that he rebuilt. Plus the
engine was very clean in appearance. 

Anyway, thanks for all the info so far. I am learning
alot. Thanks!

Have a great day!


David Kelly

I just thought I would ask.
