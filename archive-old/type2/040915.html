&gt;    Hello all, today I got my 73 bus with auto trans stuck and while in the 
&gt; process of getting unstuck reverse quit working.  When I shift into R nothing

&gt; move.  I have briefly looked at Bentley manual and nothing jumped out at me.  
&gt; Anyone on the list have any ideas or suggestions?  Does anyone know were to 
&gt; locate a rebuild kit for the early automatic transmission?  Thanks, Marcus

before you go jumping off a bridge or anything, check the linkages, the
early 73 auto tranny had the selector detents in the shifter at the front
not in the tranny. if anything moves your gear selection is off, I suspect
that you may be in neutral when you think your in Reverse.

it's worth a try anyway, cuz as far as I know nothing is avaliable for the
early tranny
