&gt;In the Muir book, he suggests that you support your transmission with
&gt;a 2 X 4 and a couple of chains.

Peter,

I'm waiting on pins and needles for the thread to spin into yarn on this one,
especially since I've sucessfully pulled the engine on my '72 (with type IV) 4
times  in the past 6 years without supporting the transmission.
