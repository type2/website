Subject: RE Heating a VW bus (and isolators)

Hi All,

I will stick my neck out here and issue a WARNING, I believe the type of heater
you describe consumes oxygen and emits CO2.  I think (again someone correct me
if I am wrong), but co2 is tastless an odorless, this means you die quietly.

Ok, maybe you keep a window open, or shut it off before you go to sleep.  I just
wanted to make sure you knew the risk.

my .0002 cents worth.

dave.  (may you sleep peacefully and wake up in the morning!)
74 bus.

Not
only do I use it while camping but also just on the way to work in the
bitter Winter time.  Works great.  It heats the bus up faster than the
wifey's F$RD.  How many T2'ers out there can say that they wouldnt be so
proud to have their SO ask to sit in your bus until their car warms up?
