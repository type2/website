Subject: VW + computer = fun (for me)

I got side tracked.

I bought a cruise control system at
thrift store for $2.50.

The computer in it was blown.  I replaced
it with a small microcontroller.

I have:
cruise control,
type in speed you want to go and press enter, vw goes that speed
press up or down buttons to increase/decrease speed by 1mph
digital speed readout on laptop screen (mounted on dash)
&quot;shift up&quot; and &quot;shift down&quot; indicators on screen.
average speed, a speed graph (compared to time)
on-screen electronic compass
GPS triggered map program.  I need to buy myself
a GPS so I can give my dads back to him.


next I want to add fuel flow sensor to get mpg,
ammount remaining in tank.

Speed sensor on CV joint on tranny.

I'll put pics of everything on my website
soon

I have approx 20 laptops that would work
for other people to add similar systems
to their vw's.  anyone interested :-)  All
documented, and failsafe.  If something
breaks, VW goes to non-computer operation.
