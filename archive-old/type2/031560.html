&gt; I use the starter fluid because it leaves little or no

don't smoke and no one in the house does either so have no ready source,
however I do have a air/acetelene torch (plumbing type, low presure)  

does anyone have any experience using one of these????, would the small
amount of acetelene &quot;hurt&quot; the engine???

&gt; &gt; &gt; old farm trick of chasing vacuum leaks with a bit
&gt; &gt; &gt; starter fluid?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; WD-40, does the same thing


&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suspected a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vacuum leak but try as I might I cannot find
&gt; &gt; one. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at any speed over idle
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it runs pretty near perfect.
