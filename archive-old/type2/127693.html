Hi everyone!

I bought a new weber progressive kit and a guy told me that I would 
need to buy a 009 distributor to installe my carb. Is this true?

I have a stock distributor on a 1700 cc engine.

Any thoughts/infos to make the best installation of the progressive 
weber??!

Thanks!

Marck

i wouldnt think so? i run a weber single progressive with the regular dizzy with the vaccum hose running to carb,.

not sure why you would have to have a 009 to make it work? as far as kit? what came with the kit?

peace
