Subject: Re: [T2] another emissions question

My solution was pretty simple: I register the Westy at my farm, 120 miles
from Dallas TX.
I get about 65% insurance discount and no tailpipe inspections. I'm the
topic of conversation while I'm in the station with everybody coming over
to take a look at the engine and Westy conversion and they normally fill
my LP tank for free since their minimum sale for LP is 5 gallons. I buy a
tank of gas (overpriced) to help them feel better about giving away 75
cents worth of LP. I consider I'm lucky if I don't have to pop the top
and light the stove for the spectators or is that spelled (spectater?).

&gt; &gt; I went through inspection with a friend and his single cab(they
&gt; &gt; check safety not emissions). The inspector looks
&gt; &gt; underneath and while knocking on the heater box says,&quot; cool, duel
&gt; &gt; cat converters&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I once had my bus state-inspected at an NTB (tire/battery chain 
&gt; owned by
&gt; Sears).  The inspector put the wand up the tailpipe of my gas heater 
&gt; to test
&gt; emissions.   It passed with flying colors. :-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I never took my bus through the CT inspection because it's
&gt; &gt; over 25 years old.  As I recall, the dyno test takes less than
&gt; &gt; one minute.  I doubt that your engine would overheat in that
&gt; &gt; amount of time.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; CT and MD sound pretty close to identical, the
&gt; &gt; machines/operators give you
&gt; &gt; &gt; an automatic second chance if you fail right away...I timed the 
&gt; car in
&gt; &gt; &gt; front of me and he  was in there on the rollers for over 5 
&gt; minutes and
&gt; &gt; &gt; varying RPM.
