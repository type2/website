Subject: Re: [T2] dual carbs to single.

&gt; out.  I probably could have solved the problem by rigging some sort of air
&gt; pre-heat system, which is what the original carb had (on the original air
&gt; cleaner), but the Weber precluded the use of the original air cleaner and
&gt; thus eliminated the air preheat system.  A poorly or incompletely engineered
&gt; conversion, in my opinion.

Great description of the icing effects (and the reason it's bad). The runners,
by the way, usually get hot-to-the-touch near the heads but stay cool near the
carb.

I've been told that if you get an old Pinto air-cleaner from a junkyard, it
has an intake for the heat riser. I have a generic circular cleaner on mine
and am not sure right now how I'll make sure that the warm air from my fabbed
riser will be drawn in over the cold air from the rest of the engine
compartment.
