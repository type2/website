You are welcome to come and take any non-spec parts off my bus that you can
find. You won't need as much as a child's lunch box to carry them all. I
was lucky (persistant). I found an original that had not yet been mucked
about with by 2 PO's (documented). The motor had been rebuilt, but
inspection showed evidence of proper procedure and fasteners throughout.
Compression balance still well within spec. Really runs nice now that I
replaced the original worn out stock carbs with NEW stock carbs. Luck
(persistance) again fer sur.
