Subject: RE: [T2] South African buses and double cabs

OK, here is the main info on transatlantic car transport in a nutshell:
- shipping company: Wallenius. I only had to deal with the Baltimore office
upon arrival. A friend who runs a shipping company booked it into the Bremen
harbor system. I guess you would normally do that through Wallenius' Bremen
office
- no import fees as I shipped it as part of my move, so it was considered a
household item
- no EPA, DOT or whatsoever hassles in the US because it was older than 25
years (do not even think about importing a younger vehicle ...)
- you have to pick it up within two weeks otherwise they put it into bonded
storage (don't ask me how I know, and do not aks me about the fees - it
still hurts)
- in summer 2002 shipping and port fees were about $850 for Westy shipped
roll-on-roll-off from Bremerhaven to Baltimore - paid in cash, money order,
or cashier's check upon arrival
- takes about two weeks to cross the pond

Marcus,
 I'd really appreciate any info on international shipping that you'd be
willing to share, what company, VAT, import fees etc. Thanks,  Britt
