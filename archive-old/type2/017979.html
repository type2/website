    Not sure what you mean by that -- I've got 205's on my '73 westy,
they work great, and I only wish I had gone with lower profile 225's all
the way around. I've got 225/70-15 in the back, and 205/70-15 in the
front, should have done 225/60-15s all the way.
    I also had 205's all the way around on my '81 vanagon, that that too
handled quite well. Were you trying to put 205's on the stock rims? That
would cause handling problems, especially if they were not either LT or
lowprofile tires.
