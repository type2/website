Subject: Re: [T2] Dipstick Marks

&gt;I have a 1.8 ltr in my 74 that was built on a GE code case.

I was pretty sure that GE cases are 79 2 liter cases.

&gt;From the bottom up do they mean
LOW-FULL-OVERFULL, or LOWER-LOW-FULL, or what?

Top line is for Full, bottom is for Low, but not too low, middle is middle.
