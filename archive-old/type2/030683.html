Hey folks...

this weekend, I'm headed from Augusta, GA to Huntsville AL, to
(hopefully!) rescue the 68 Westy from the junkyard.  (The one that Martin
P. posted...)

We have no idea of its mechanical condition, but I'm going to attempt to
get it running, and stoping, so I can get it back to augusta.  Try.:)

got 2 extra batteries, in case of a bum charging system...and 4 tires,
cause Martin said the ones that are on it are..well.

wish me luck.:)

If we're not able to get it to the point of taking a shot at driving it
home, we've secured a parking place at a local (to them..:) vw shop/yard.

Going to try to be in town sat. morning, when the yard opens.

If anyone is between there and here...

My intended route to GET there is I 20 to 431 in Anniston.  431 to the
road that the yard is off of....

Back might be different, but will most definitly include anniston. (family
there. That means free food, and other supplies...might be able to dig
some parts too from some various stashes...:)


wish me luck!

later...david
