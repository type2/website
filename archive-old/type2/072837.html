Subject: BAP quality??

Help:

In need some information regarding the general quality level of BAP
supplied type IV 2.0L rebuilt heads.  I am purchasing a bus in Pheonix,
from long distance and the vehicle had rebuilt heads installed within the
last year.  I talked to the shop and they said they installed rebuilt heads
supplied to them by BAP.  Does anyone have any comments regarding what I
can expect with regard to longevity of these heads.  Is BAP reputable?

I'm trying to determine whether I can expect the engine in this bus to hold
up over a 2000 mile trip home, or mebbe I should ship it.

Please pmail responses asap

thanx
