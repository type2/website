Just another comment on cooling flaps, and engine warm up time.
After the fire, becasue the flap bushings were melted, I wired my flaps
open, disabling the thermostat. On my short runs of about 4 miles to work,
I found that the gas milage sucked. It got worse as the weather got cooler 
going into the fall. I didn't measure the milage, I just noticed that I
seemed to 
be stoppong for gas way more often. I believe  this was because with the
flaps
open, the engine was not getting a chance to heat up, and therefore was
running less 
efficiently during these short runs.
NOTE that this is not a scientific fact, but just a gut feel opinion
