Subject: Dwell by other means.

Dwell angle can be estimated by measuring the average (over time)voltage 
across the points and the coil input voltage and then using the following 
equation:

dwell angle(degrees) = 90 [Vave/Vcoil]
As an example
If

Vave = 6.5 volts (Terminal 1)

and

Vcoil = 13.0 volts (Terminal 15)

dwell angle = 90 * .5 = 45 degrees

There are a number of error sources associated with this method.

1. The meters ability to accurately measure the average voltage of a pulse 
train. Some digital (and analog) meters can and some can't. In any case use 
a DC range for this measurement.

2. The Vave wave form generated by the points is not an ideal rectangular 
pulse train.

3. Vcoil has noise superimposed by coil condenser ringing.

If you are worried about setting the dwell to 50 +/- 0 degrees this is not 
the recommend method.


BTW

Can a T2 engine be expected to idle normally (900 RPM) with the points dwell 
set at 15 degrees?
