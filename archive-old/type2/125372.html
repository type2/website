Subject: Using the Bus Depot part number search engine

&gt; Ron's search works IF YOU KNOW the part number.......  it 
&gt; does not work if you know the part name and search for it.  
&gt; As an example, I searched for part  # 021256322B and it came 
&gt; back with the description of 'Heater Channel Cover Tin'. So I 
&gt; went back to the main page, picked 72-79 bus, and then typed 
&gt; Heater Channel Cover Tin in the 'Search all of the above 
&gt; parts' box. The search came back: 'No items found. Please 
&gt; change your search criteria'.........


It helps to understand how the BusDepot_dot_com search system works, in
order to make the most of it. It is the largest VW parts database on the
net, and is very powerful if you use it right.

The search boxes on the main (white) pages are context sensitive. For
example, if you click on &quot;72-79 bus&quot; and then use the search box, it
will search only those parts that are listed as fitting that year range.
If you click on &quot;72-79 bus&quot; and then &quot;clutch components,&quot; now the same
search box will only search clutch parts for that year range. This
context-sensitive search is probably the best place to start. As with
any search engine, remember to try different wording, or even different
categories. For example, a clutch cable might be listed under clutch
parts and/or under cables; if you search under _all_ '72-79 parts
instead of just under clutch parts, you'll find it regardless.

The search box on the left yellow menu bar, by comparison, is a global
search that looks at the entire parts database - close to 200,000 parts
- regardless of vehicle application, or even if we have no application
data for that part at all.  This is the largest VW parts database on the
web, and includes pretty much every Volkswagen part that was available
at the time I assembled the database (some of which may have been
discontinued since then, unfortunately). You may find the part this way
even if you couldn't using the context-sensitive search.  Most likely
because we do list the part, but do not have application data entered
for it (so it is not coming up in the context-sensitive search). This
was the case in the example that you cited. Incidentally, although not
mentioned on the website, that box will also search by keyword, but this
is of limited use since it doesn't filter by vehicle application (for
example it brings up about 250 results for keyword &quot;muffler.&quot;)  It will
also search many Bosch part numbers and even many Rocky Mountain
Motorworks and West Coast Metric numbers. (Although in the latter case
we may have the part cheaper under an alternate number).

The reason I suggest trying the context-sensitive keyword search first
is that it can be more useful. First of all, even if you have a part
number, that number may have been superceded. A keyword search could
bring up the new superceded number, or even an alternate part number
that does the same job for less money (i.e. the same part under a Bosch
number rather than a VW number), whereas a search for a specific part
number will only look for the exact number string that you entered. But
on the other hand, if the keyword search doesn't net you a result, the
global search might. If both fail, then you've just struck out after
searching 200,000 parts. Maybe the part was discontinued or superceded
to a new number.
