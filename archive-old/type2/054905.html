Subject: 79 Westy deluxe for sale

Hey all,

I am back after a long hiatus from the list.  Not that I would expect people
to remember me or anything like that.  But at any rate, I am enjoying
reading about things VW again.

Reluctantly, however, I must part with my van. Mind you I don't really want
to, but there are a number of factors contributing to this dilemma.

At any rate here is the skinny on my 79 Westy:

--Located in Austin, Texas
--Deluxe model (I am not sure the diff between a regular and deluxe, but
that is what it is)
--Mexican Beige (color that is)
--Mileage = 139000+ original miles, 14,000 on replacement engine (AVP 2.0
Liter)
--Fuel Injection was replaced in former life with a Weber Progressive
--5 new tires (Michelin X1's)
--The only rust is around the windows (usual spots)
--All of the camper stuff works (Icebox, Stove, Sink)
--The pop top canvas has a small hole where it got pinched in the pop top
supports (happened before I got it)
--Upholstery is in excellent condition, except for the drivers seat where it
is ripped.
--Interior is in Very good to Excellent condition
--Transmission is original, but in good condition
--Stops good
--Starts every time on the first try
--I had VW replace the heater tubes when they did that in 1998
--The rear screen is present and accounted for
--The front windscreen curtain is present and accounted for
--Both tables(front, and large rear) present and accounted for
--Stool/trash bin/storage box present and accounted for
--Included is a side tent, it needs new door screens sewed into is as they
have deteriorated over the years, and it has a small rip in one of the sides
--All of the tent poles are present and accounted for
--WCM parcel trays (not the best, but they are installed)
--Child cot present and accounted for
--Kenwood cd stereo installed below the dash, original radio is still in the
dash, and does work

This van spent the first 15 years of its life in Houston, which explains the
rust, but even so it has very little rust for never having been restored

I am biased, but this is a very solid van, and drives great, but seeing as
it only seats 4 and I am a family of 5 we cannot go on family outings in it.
Plus my 74 Thing is being neglected, and I need to get to work on it.

I would like to get $3000 for it, but I am open to negotiation.  You can
contact me at this address during the day, or my home email,
david.g_at_bigfoot_dot_com in the evening.

Cheers,

David Goldberg
