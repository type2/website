hello again.  i asked earlier about a source for the chrome body molding
&amp; clips, but my next question is:

how do i get the chrome strips OFF the bus? i did manage to get one section
off, but it looked to be held on with double-stick tape instead of
the actual clip.  i dont want to damage them
when taking them off, but i really need to get under there &amp; clean all
that gunk.

TIA.

Joel Wilson
72 bus (that will have very shiny chrome once i can get them off!!!!)
