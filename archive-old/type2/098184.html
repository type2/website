It didn't on a monospaced font.  I fixed it below.  also, the diode was
in the wrong place:
&gt;
&gt;                              (splice)
&gt; switched power -----diode-------&amp;------------ cd player
&gt;                (Radio Shack     |

                $1.49 for two)    |
&gt;                                 |
                                  |
&gt;                              [+side]
&gt;                       electrolytic capacitor (#272-1047; $2.49)
&gt;                              [-side]
&gt;                                 |
&gt;                                 |
&gt;                               Ground

The diode has to be oriented to allow current toward the CD player

The idea is that the capacitor is charged by the switched current and then
keeps the radio going if the switched voltage drops.  The diode prevents
the capacitor from discharging back to the switch.

Glad that the capacitor helped!
