It's Friday!!

And it's Santa Ana Wind season here in sunny SoCal. And some of you may ask
yourself, &quot;Self, what are the Santa Ana's like to drive a 1969 Westy in?&quot;

To which I would answer:

Last week, we had Santa Ana coming out of the north foothills. I was driving
west on the freeway. This means I was being buffeted by 0-45 mph winds from
the right side. Now, there's a particular right hand curve during all of
this. Let's get out the physics books. Turn right, lean left. 45 mph gust on
top of that, and I swear to each of you that I was up on two wheels (the
left wheels) at 60 mph. Had to jerk the steering wheel left (which put me 2
feet into the lane next to me - thank God no one was close) to get me back
to horizontal. Wind shows mercy, and gust stops. Palms sweat. Heart starts
to pitter-patter.

Half a mile down the road, the wind blows steady so hard (from the north
still) my poptop opens from the airfoil effect, breaking the two front
rubber clamps (or what was left of their good rubber), and sending a gust of
wind down my neck. By the time I look back, the poptop had just about alit,
but the canvas was obviously not put back very neatly. I really need to make
that rear mount stay put somehow.

This week, the semi's were going 35 mph on the freeway, and I was barely
passing them at 40 mph - not from headwinds - from the side gusts. I just
didn't want to take a chance going any faster.

The best part is when the winds start swirling, and you don't know which way
they're going to hit.

Hrumph, Driver's Wanted. White-knuckled, sweaty-palmed, heart-pounding,
knees-shaking, eyes-a-buggin' Driver's Wanted.

I can hardly wait to drive home. Have a great weekend!
