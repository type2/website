&lt;&lt; Hello, I anxiously await your web page.  &gt;&gt;

Sorry to take so long on this folks. Up-loading to AOL was a pain. Files were
big, links wouldn't work, lots of photos/diagrams. Operator error, mostly.

I have shipped the whole site to a chap on the Vanagon list to post on his
mindspring server. He knows his web stuff. Should see it in the next couple of
days. Hang in there.
