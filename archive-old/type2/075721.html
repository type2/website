Subject: Re: [T2] Welding your VW-braizing? Puzzling anecdote.



&gt; Brazing is a quick way to attatch panel's and do repair work, except for
the fact that primer, and paint doesn't stick to the brass, unless the area
is acid etched primed, with zinc chromate------

&gt; Brazing is also a soft weld--not as strong as using steel wire----

As Terry says, brazing is not as strong as welding, but the tear apart force
required is still way more than you'll ever see on body panels.  Brazing is
more like soldering, where the brass acts as a glue for the steel, than true
welding, where the steel is actually melted together.

Funny thing.  I brazed an inner fender for a truck several years ago, and
the brazed place has a magnetic field.  It attracts iron filings, and you
can just make out the shape of the line where the steel was torn and joined
with brass.  Maybe George Lyle or some other smart person knows why.

Regards,

Grant
