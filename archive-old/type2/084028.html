Subject: Re: [T2] Points 'wore' out

Barry, this happened to me on the crosscountry trip in 95- the rubbing
block simply broke in half, resulting in the rapid increase of dwell,
retarding of timing, and stalling when not pushing the throttle.  Cheap
brazilian points, possible lack of lubrication on the cam against the
block in the rather hot August Arizona Desert we were in.

&gt; Hi.
&gt; 
&gt; The rubbing 'leg' on my ignition points 'wore' down in just a few thousand
&gt; miles and in just a few months.  They were installed in June 2001 on a '78
&gt; Westy FI 2.0l by yours truly, and have about 6K miles on them.
