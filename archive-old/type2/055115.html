Subject: thanks.....

well fellas i just want to thank you all for the overwelming positive 
response to my question about the '78 bus.  i AM going to buy it.  i won't 
have an opportunity to check much stuff out before i buy it though, the guy 
really wants to get rid of it quick and its sitting in a sketchy spot 
so..... i figure i'll run a compression test just to make sure all the 
cylinders are ok and if so i'll buy it.  it sounds like a vaccum leak 
problem to me too, if i keep my foot on the gas at higher rpm's the engine 
will stay running.....foot off the gas and stall city...

anyway thanks again and i'm sure you'll be hearing from again soon...

mark.
lancaster, pa.
