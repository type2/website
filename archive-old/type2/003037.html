Get the rear wheels off the ground and check for play/looseness in the
wheels.  If they are loose try tightening the castellated nuts.  I have had
them come loose * especially if they were put back on, with  an air ratchet*
and make the same  noise as  you describe.

Subject: [T2] Vibrations and noises from rear?


&gt; For the past 8000 miles or so I've been noticing an increasing vibration
from
&gt; the rear of my 73 Westy.  I've had the tires balanced and even rotated
them and
&gt; that had no effect on the vibration whatsoever.  The vibration is MUCH
more
&gt; noticable under accelleration and even more so while going around a curve
(left
&gt; seems to be worse than right, but both directions do it).  More recently,
I've
&gt; also begun noticing a distinct, loud clicking sound from the back end
while
&gt; going around corners.
&gt;
&gt; So, are these symptoms associated with rear bearings going bad or just
CV's?
&gt; I've never replace the rear bearings and they're bound to have about 240k
miles
&gt; on them.  CV's have about 20k on them and were regreased about 10k miles
ago.
&gt;
&gt; Any comments or ramblings on noises/vibrations associated with rear
bearings
&gt; greatly appreciated.
