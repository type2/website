Subject: '71 turn signal, only left front fails
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I posted a couple of weeks back about various electrical problems.. I've
solved all of them but one.

The left front turn signal doesn't work correctly.  However, the light goes
fine when I turn on hazard lights... and the parking lights are also fine.
So no ground problem on the light end...

I've checked the light housings and cleaned all the contacts... fine.  Also
pulled out the flasher relay and cleaned contacts there.  Any ideas why only
this one blinker doesn't work?
