Subject: Jetting Q's for MPG to John and others  (was Solex versus
  Brosol)

Jim scribeth:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you will note, Beetles used different
(larger) main &amp; air correction jets than the Type
2.  New Brosols these days
are coming with 127 or 130 main jets, ergo
they're set up for the Beetle.
Different load characteristics of the Type 2 make
this jetting profile a bit
on the rich side:

Beetle 1971 34PICT3 (MT or Auto)
Main Jet 130
Air Correction Jet 75/80z
Idle Pilot 60

Type 2 1971
Main Jet 125
Air Correction Jet 60z
Idle Pilot 57.5 (superseded to 55 as replacement)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whence did writeth John:

&lt;these carbs DO NOT NEED A 60 IDLE JET. People
jet them pig rich so the
customer doesn't whine about hesitation, and they
rarely complain about poor
MPG.

John, like everyone else, I'd like to get the
best mileage I can.  I'm a tad confused about
some of the conflicting info from different
sources and intergrating the information.  (For
example:  some sources say bump up the main jet
if you are using a Mallory.)  

What is your recommendation for a 70 bus with a
stock 1600 dp w/ your SVDA and Mallory 6, plugs
gapped .045 or .050, and stock exhaust?  What do
you recommend for best gas mileage?  I could live
with a slight hesitation or a slightly less than
optimal power.   

Are there any other mods you would suggest?

Anyone else have comments?  


Happy bussin'
Ray
