Subject:  luggage rack spacers

Have installed my luggage rack on '70 Westy. Could not find suitable rubber
spacers for rear of rack so ended up making them from rubber hose. Used 5/8&quot;
inside diameter radiator hose, inserted 5/8&quot; outside diameter, 3/8&quot; inside
diameter rubber garden hose into larger hose (use lubricant) and put 3/8&quot;
polyethylene tubing inside of this for added stiffness. Made up a 1 foot section
of the above and then cut to appropriate lengths. Trimmed the 3/8&quot; tubing just a
bit shorter to add a bit of squishiness. Mounted rack and seems to work fine.
