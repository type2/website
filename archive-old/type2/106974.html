Subject: RE: painting a bus

The knooks and crannies are clean and zero rust (ZR) may not be well known but 
it will put a very good layer down for rust prevention, the stuff was designed 
for offshore oil rigs, I will then apply a high build primer on top of once the 
shrinkage phase is complete. Go to the Autobodystore_dot_com discussion page and 
ask about it (ZR). I've heard nothing but good things about it. I agree I do 
need some type of air gun to apply the stuff with though but like I said in the 
previous message I cannot spray it where I am at because of restrictions at the 
facility.
