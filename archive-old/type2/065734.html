Subject: Re: Why leaded gasoline is cheaper than unleaded gas.

&gt;I believe leaded gas was first manufactured around WWII.  They needed to change
&gt;the composition of the gas to prevent detonation and one way to do that
&gt;was to add &quot;tetraethyl lead&quot;.  This would lower the ignigtion temp of the gas
&gt;and make it run good.  Of course lead is bad so they went to a more involved
&gt;refinement process to leave the lead out.

I think it was much earlier than that, and I think the actual additive is
metylethylead? Something like that. Gasoline was originally considered a
cull byproduct in the production of (then valuable) kerosene and was dumped
into rivers as a nuisance. It also occurs naturally as condensation where
oil is welled. Gasoline-powered engines only became feasible when it was
discovered that the introduction of lead would slow the burn rate to where
it is manageable; before that internal combustion with gas was basically a
series of barely-controlled explosions. Maybe like driving with a tank full
of lacquer thinner. ;)
