Subject: Re: [T2] re: aux. battery - - - one more thing

A relay is a simple switch that an electric source will operate remotely. 
You connect the battery pos posts together through the relay contacts. That 
leaves two terminals that actuate the contacts. One goes to anything that 
you want to control the relay. Should be 5 volts or higher  - - a switch 
that can supply 5v+ when it is closed (on) or something like the coil which 
is on anytime the key is on. The last terminal needs a simple ground - this 
is other half of the contact actuator circuit.

You could set it up where the relay only closes when the lights are on, or 
the van is in reverse or when the aux fan is running, or....

None of the above is useful but it all could be done.

And you can get a replacement relay at Radio Shack for $6. There are 
hundreds of other places that you could get one cheaper (maybe) but I know 
the Radio Shack relay works... It is very same relay as my Hella aux. 
lights came with (I looked inside too).

80 = positive main battery post
87 = positive aux battery post
85 = ground terminal next to left taillight
86 = anything that is hot only with the key such as the coil.
