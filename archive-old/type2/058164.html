If you are going into Canada with a pup, you definitely need rabies
shots current and papers proving it. As for otherwise -- the Canucks are
mostly worried about guns and &quot;forbidden&quot; literature (like Soldier of
Fortune magazine, rightwing political lit, martial arts mags and
equipment, etc.) they have only minimal concern about drugs. The US, on
the other hand, is mostly concerned about drugs -- but if you are clean
(and I mean clean) it's no sweat -- but they can confiscate your rig for
even seeds and stems.
