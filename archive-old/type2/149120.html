Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Re: Stranded, Ignition switch won't turn all the 
  way

&lt;While I had the whole thing half-disassembled I jiggled the key around
a bit and got it to turn the whole way again. However I can't
reproduce whatever steps I did to make that happen again.

I'm thinking the part I'll be needing to replace is the assembly in
between the locking mechanism and the switch, the part that contains
the steering lock assembly.&gt;

Please consider that your key may just be worn out and not pressing the tumblers completely into their places. You might be able to have a key made (not a copy) from the numbers and fix everything...
