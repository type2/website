&gt; The only paint spraying equipment that doesn't need a compressor is an
&gt; airless.

Speaking of which, and just out of curiosity, would it be practical to use
an airless to spray auto paint?  I've used an airless to paint my house
and was impressed with how nicely and quickly it got the paint onto the
surface.

I don't think that I would use an airless to paint less than an entire
house, though, as cleaning the thing was a major hassle.

I think that Wagner makes a hand-held airless of some sort, but I don't
know how well it works.

Heck, the latest issue of Hot Rod magazine has an articla on how to paint
a car with a roller!  The car passed the 20/20 test pretty well.  That
might be the way to go for those of us who want reasonable looking buses
but don't have the resources for a concours paint job.
