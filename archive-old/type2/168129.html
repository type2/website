Subject: shift bushings

Who has the rear shift rod bushings for an &quot;82&quot; Vanagon westy.
 
The shift rod comes apart at the end near the tranny when I shift in  
reverse. there looks like there should be a bushing an a small rod  mounted  to the 
tranny, or in the end coupler.  I do not have my Bentley in front of  me, but I 
need to know who sells them.
