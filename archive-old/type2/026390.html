Hi there 
when i was in Puerto Vallarta this winter i met a great guy by the name 
of Swen while on a snorkeling tour who is also a big vw phreak. Swen is 
i believe from europe originally but now resides in Vallarta.

Anyway Swen has emailed me and asked if i know of anyone who might have 
a panel van for sale in california he will be heading up for the spring 
meet in Fresno cali on the 29th of this month.
if anyone has any details please let me know 
thanks 
scott
