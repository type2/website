Jack,
Try out this site.  It might save you some unnecessary fiddling and

&gt; I have access to an oscilloscope and have a stable of ACVWs.  Is anyone
&gt; aware of a circuit which would couple the signal from each of the spark
&gt; plug wires to the scope input so that firing pulses from all four can be
&gt; simultaneously displayed?
&gt; 
&gt; Seems to me as though this would be an invaluable peek at the stability of
&gt; distributor and points and the condition of plug wires.
