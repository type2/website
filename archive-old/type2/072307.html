&gt; &gt;Why do we love our vans so much even though they require so much work and 
&gt; &gt;go so slow?

This is a Friday subject, I suspect.

I get a little tired too of my mother-in-law, nephews, etc, etc shaking their 
heads when I am towed into the house one more time. 

But, it happens about every two months. And I do my best to keep these things 
maintained. I spend money on them. I work hard on them. 

My latest bus (a 72 Bay with built in tow-bar on the front, for just this 
kind of thing....) developed carb linkage trouble just last week. 

(BTW, the butterfly shaft for the front barrel of the carb was sticking open. 
I removed the carb, cleaned it up, cleaned the throttle mechanism by removing 
almost all of the pieces down to near the spring (I did NOT remove that part, 
whew...) cleaned, lubricated and reassembled them, backed off the tightness 
1/4 turn, and flipped the ears down on the nut. It runs great (but the idle 
is too high after I reconnected the cable, but I can figure that one out as 
soon as I get a minute.) 

Why? Why do we do this? 

Because if we don't, nobody will. Because they are there. And somehow, I 
guess I am reliving my squandered youth.
