I've already made a small donation via paypal, but I had another idea to
generate cash for the list that would allow a larger number of people to
donate.

Recently I have given away a couple parts for the cost of shipping since I
know I wouldn't use them and someone else wanted them. Not everybody has
spare cash laying around, but most of us have spare parts laying around
that came with that parts bus or we picked and added to our pile at the
boneyard.

Maybe we could donate unused/unwanted/unneeded parts to type2_dot_com, they
could be posted on the site and people could buy them from type2_dot_com. We
wouldn't have to ship the part to type2_dot_com, we would pledge the part. When
someone bought the part from type2_dot_com the donater would ship the part to
the buyer, and would have the opportunity to recover our shipping or donate
that to type2_dot_com as well.

There would be a subtle benefit for the purchaser since the money would
sort of be in escrow with type2, and if the &quot;seller/donater&quot; never gets
around to shipping the proffered part they could retrieve their money from
type2_dot_com. Obviously there are a lot of details to work out, this would
require someone to take time to administer, and would require some server
space to host. But if we are buying a high-priced $1400 server we should
have the room, right?

PS I would think we would want to avoid partially donating the part, like
say giving 2 new brake drums to type2_dot_com for $40, knowing they will sell
for more and type2_dot_com will make money off the transaction. That would be
too many details, money changing hands etc. Hopefully most of the
transactions would be a straight donation with type2_dot_com receiving ALL the
money.
