Subject: New member, future Westy owner

Hello to the T2 list. What a resource!

I'm a past owner of 2 Ghia's, (64 &amp; 66), a squareback VW (forgot the 
year) and a Jetta GTI (my wife's favorite) We're currently driving a 
'99 Honda CRV (winter) and a '91 Mercury Capri (summer). A '61 Austin 
Healey 3000 (2+2) is getting stripped for parts to sell and ebay. I've 
also owned at various times a '68 Volvo 122S, '66 Dodge Dart (slant 6, 
four on the floor), Toyota Corolla's, 52 Chevy PU, and a mid 60's  
Dodge PU with push button auto trans.

We're purchasing a green '78 Westy from a fellow in Utah (ad on Samba) 
and driving it home to Michigan the second week of '05. If the weather 
keeps up we shouldn't have any problems with overheating (heh heh). 
I've been doing my homework, especially reading the T2 list and am 
looking forward to waving my greasy hand to other bus owners on the 
road trips we plan to take.

Wish us luck in getting home with &quot;Edie&quot; and hope to see some of you on 
the road next summer! If you live near Ann Arbor MI, give us a shout!

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to you all,

Rick Cronn
