&gt; Happy Friday y'all!  I'm missing my type2 fix, haven't received the
&gt; digest for several days now, is there a problem with the new system, or
&gt; do I need to subscribe again? Thanks!

OH, my :-( well, alas, the digest is *still* not working, and at this
point, I am out of hair to pull (not a huge achievement, there hasn't been
any to pull really since the mid-70's :-).  Tomorrow, the list will
probably disappear for a couple of hours while the software is
re-installed and patched :-( if that doesn't cure the problem, I don't
know what to do :-( We are not giving up!  We *will* get the digest
working!  I promise!

The whole list should receive this message, as I have tacked the
digest list onto the interactive list for a couple of minutes.  I
apologise if a couple other posts sneak thru.

*IMPORTANT*  If you get this post, then you are on the subscriber list!!!
You don't have to re-subscribe!!!  The problem is here, not there!
