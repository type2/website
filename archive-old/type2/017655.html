Subject: Re: winch on a bus

    Gee - I used to be a real expert on getting buses unstuck. I'd be
willing to bet good money that I've spent more time stuck in the mud
(sand/gravel beach/snow,etc) than anybody on the list. Which, I guess,
certainly testifies to my absolute stupidity about where *NOT* to drive
a bus. We've &quot;levered&quot; the bus out of mud holes with small trees, built
corderoy roads -- god, what memories! A winch would be great -- but you
have to be able to find something solid to hook it to, or it's useless.
I once spent two _at_%_at_$%_at_$% weeks with a very large cat stuck in a beaver
pond. It had a winch, and a very long cable, but I couldn't reach
anything with it. Finally chained a log across the tracks in the front
and got out. 
    Anyway -- buses ain't 4WD. And a winch on a bus is okay, but you
don't have much to bolt it down to -- you'll rip the bumper off if you
try that. Those little tow thingys rip right out too if you're high
centered. A good Hi-Lift jack and some cable is a pretty good investment
if you're going into the back country -- it'll work as a winch, also
lift the bus right up when the puny factory jack will just fall over or
sink outa sight in the mud. You also need to get something to stick in
the jack holes to work with the HiLift jack. 
     Foresight is the best tool. Check out dubious looking roads
thoroughly before driving ahead. Beaches can be a real disaster, they
look great and you go right down. Axes and shovels do wonders too.
