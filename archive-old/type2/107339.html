Subject: Re: [T2] Timing Advance/ retard  Chart

Alan

I think your looking for chapter 5 pg 81  21 (i) Basic tune up fuel injection
chapter 5 pg 72  table i  might help you

ignition timing 1976 and later, except 79 and later calif.  7.5 deg Before TDC
with vac connected

dwell ,, 44 - 50 deg 

I have no idea why you would want to read over 1000 rpm on a tach
unless your trying to plot your timing vs rpm curve, and in that case, your in
luck, as the entire advance is all in by 2400 rpm

That would be chapter 5 pg 75 table j

all that is from the Green Volkswagen manual, 1968 - 1979  isbn 0-8376-0094-4

Hope that helps

Jamie Rivers

&gt; Could someone please point out the pages in the Bentley book for the graphs
&gt; I can use to figure out where my timing should be?
&gt; 
&gt; I can only read up to 2400 RPM on my Tachometer.
