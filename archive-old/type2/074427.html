Subject: Re: [T2] heat


&gt;
&gt;Nuclear-powered bus...hmmm...how about a little steam turbine in place of
&gt;your VW engine with a ball valve attached to your throttle cable to control
&gt;the steam going into it? Non-polluting, fairly safe so long as you don't
&gt;have any meltdowns, and you can even get an Alternative Fuels tax credit on
&gt;your 1040!

I still don't like to stand too close to the microwave. The Bus would 
definitely have to be a stretched model...

And you could bury the waste in your back yard right??? &lt;grin&gt;

I think for the cost I'd lean towards one of the various Tatra V-8 engines....
