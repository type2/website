Subject: Re: [T2] VWoA part numbers

Tried looking up those numbers and i get the NLA.  However i compared 
the numbering with some other engines in the system and it appears what 
you got is an entire new engine and not a refurbished.  How long ago was 
that done??

&gt;&gt; The receipt shows two items, both at a cost of $747.29
&gt;&gt; The part numbers are :
&gt;&gt; VWA 039100031D/1
&gt;&gt; VWA 039100031D/2
&gt;&gt; The description is :
&gt;&gt; New 2.0 75/79
&gt;&gt; New 2.0 75/79
&gt;&gt; There is also a receipt for installing a customers motor, for about 
&gt;&gt; $400.
&gt;&gt; So I guess it was a new motor, but why the two part numbers?
