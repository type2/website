&gt; Throughout the day yesterday the bus was losing power off the line.  Started
&gt; with a lag when shifting from 1 to 2.  By the time it was time to drive to
&gt; school, power had subsided such that I had to ditch it in a parking lot and
&gt; continue on foot.
&gt;
&gt; The symptoms are compatible with a fuel-filter clog, but I just changed it a
&gt; few weeks ago.  I have another new one on deck that I'll swap in tonight,


mine was doing that not very long ago, turned out that the vacuum
advance can had a leak in the diaphram.

another check I would make is the AFM plug.  with it loose or removed the
engine will idle fine but won't have any power or accel.

good luck

Bob
