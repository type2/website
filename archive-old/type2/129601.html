&gt;I received a reply from their shipping guy stating that the

&gt;could be shipped on Monday.

Sounds like Eric Allred. He was fabricating these a while back for his own use and was going to make up a batch of them to sell until their cost for the thermostat went up. Now a conversion costs $50 like the dealer price for the Wahler thermostat when it still available. Pity.
