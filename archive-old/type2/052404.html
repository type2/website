Subject: [T2] Engine pulls and bloody knuckles!

Hi Volks,
I just finished pulling the 1.7 engine in my newly acquired 72 Westy. I have
learned that the sheetmetal on a type 4 is very sharp! Some observations on
this particular engine are:
1 Seems to be original engine running condition but many oil leaks.

2 The 1.8 I have to replace it with is a 75 and had F.I. so I'll have to run
an electric pump with pressure regulator.

3 This thing has lots of heater plumbing, some missing.

4 1.7 has an oil psi sender that I'll probably switch to the 1.8 ( haven't
checked the 1.8 yet)

Question for the list:
The 1.7 has a center mount ( I guess Holly/ Webber) carb which seemed to
work well. I have some 40mm Webbers that I was going to use on the 1.8 in
another application. Which carb/carbs would you use?
 I have noticed a few posts about the single mount carb and frankly have not
paid much attention to them so forgive me if this has been already
discussed.

I'm also looking for the fold out table along the drivers wall if you have
one in Calif. I'd be interested.
