&gt; I'm not sure that this will be a big help, but you be the judge.  My 70
Bus
&gt; is Savannah Beige (L620) and Cloud White (L581).

&gt; Wow, &quot;Cloud White&quot; that's new one I guess. Probably one of those white's
&gt; that was only available in combination with another colour.

My '69 is also Savannah Beige and Cloud White. That is the Cloud White is
used for the roof only. I expected the bumpers to be L90 D but it turns out
these are cloud white also (as I found out when touching up some spots).
