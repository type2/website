Thanks.

&gt; A pump curve is to show what a pump can do at varying demands. The
&gt; pressure requirements of the bus f.i. system are constant, unlike
&gt; most civil engineering. This pressure is supplied whether at idle or
&gt; at full engine load, and is maintained by the regulator. The basic
&gt; pump check is probably a 90% reliable method here.

I agree the pump is trying to pump a constant volume of fluid. But
there is a world of difference between pumping liquid into a pail
(this is called zero pressure) and pumping liquid into a pressurized
container (in our case the fuel loop). You cannot just say &quot;well the
pump pumps this much fluid with no load on it therefore it must pump
out the same amound at 50psi&quot;. 

&gt; &gt;If the pump is defective is very well might pump the required
&gt; &gt;&gt;volume w/ no pressure on the pressure side, but fail miserably
&gt; &gt;&gt;when &gt;required to pump a volume w/ a pressure. Plus we aren't
&gt; &gt;&gt;taking &gt;water pumps here, but fuel pumps.
&gt; 
&gt; I see where you're going, but I think in terms of driveway physics,
&gt; if your pump is putting out the specified volume/time, you can
&gt; assume it's effective enough for our purposes. 

no, the FI system has to have enough pressure in the loop to perform
properly. A lack of the proper pressure will cause bad running engine.

&gt; Furthermore, I don't
&gt; believe the type of pump water/fuel really has any bearing. We are
&gt; talking about a 'fuel' pump pumping 'fuel', so there's no
&gt; apples/oranges problem here. The physics is uniform.

Sorry bad analogy on my part &amp; you snipped out my point on this which
basically was the safety issue. Testing pumps to see what they do is
much safer if the fluid you are pumping isn't volatile. That was all I
was refering to, not that pumps will magically work different w/
different liquids through them. and yes you are correct the physics
involved here are uniform.

&gt; Nor do I, but nobody says you have to test it under your bus half
&gt; soaked in gas, smoking a butt, either. Take the pump off, get a
&gt; fused circuit on a 12v battery in a clean, controlled location.

I just advise against it. that's all I'm saying.

&gt; &gt;No. While replacing fuel lines is a must for any bus you don't know
&gt; &gt;the history of, Diagnose then replace is the way to go. All he
&gt; &gt;would know is that he has new hoses, while this is a good thing he
&gt; &gt;has no idea of the condition of the pump, or any restrictions in
&gt; &gt;the lines that he can't replace.

&gt; You're contradicting yourself. You say replacing fuel lines is a
&gt; must for any bus, but perform some verification anyway. Just change
&gt; the fuel lines! It needs to happen, so do it and see if it solves
&gt; the problem. You're having logic-block here. We've also (depending
&gt; on who you agree with here) eliminated the fuel pump, and with the
&gt; lines all off, there shouldn't be any &quot;you can't replace&quot; and the
&gt; metal ones can be visually inspected.

No, no contridition here. You should be replacing fuel lines in the bus
to hopefully prevent engine fires, not to track down a fuel delivery
problem. This guy still doesn't know that his pump can deliver the
required volume at operating pressure. So we haven't eliminated the
pump yet. What he can do w/ the gage is to hook it up, run the engine
untill it quits &amp; make notes of what the loop pressure does. If it
keeps going down then it quits, chances are he is starving the pump
either from a restriction in the line or bad filter (which he did
replace). The lines I was refering to &quot;can't replace&quot; are the two
metal lines coming out of the fuel tank, while they are small other
than trying to clean them, if there is a restriction at that point
then he can't simply remove them &amp; replace them w/ a new set.

&gt; Buying a 30.00-50.00 pressure gauge to test fuel lines you should
&gt; replace anyway doesn't make sense as a starting point. Fuel lines
&gt; are maintenance items, requiring replacement by nature. Perform this
&gt; ritual before buying instruments.

We aren't testing the fuel lines. Well not directly. I am suggesting
testing the entire circuit as a whole, depending on the results he
gets from testing he should be able much more acurately to diagnose
the real problem. Replacing the lines can be part of the repair, but
shouldn't be part of the repair process.
