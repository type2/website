This is the way most Californians do it.   I never have, but this is what
they do:

Drive Bug or Bus across border, smile at the Migra, go home, sleep, get up,
go to DMV, ask for a duplicate Title cuz you lost yours, long term
restoration proccess, have moved several times, can't find it. They check
the ID numbet, tell you that is is not on the computer, they verify it on
the car again, put it in your name, 10 days later, you have a MEXICAN VW
with CA plates and title.

That is the only way i have heard of , without changing components.


Good luck, sounds like it should work
