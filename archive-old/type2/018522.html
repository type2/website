Subject: help, i need somebody...
Message-ID: &lt;3767391A.E8758A3A_at_cartsys_dot_com&gt;

k, so i was told that i need to rebuild my engine---&gt;

    well, long story short: i drove my 1971 for 4 days with the oil
light
    on. she always did leak oil (incredible amounts!), and so she died.
she
     started to shudder and slow down, losing power til she died.
shaking and
    making knocking sound. got some oil in her later that day, she drove
til
    what i did was wrong. i havent touched the van in a couple of
months. i
      can give more details...anyone who might be able to help?

    so first off, how hard is this? i have muir and am getting wilson,
but im more than a bit scared of doing this. i live in petaluma (a
little north of san francisco, CA),
anyone around here willing to help? what should i do before i start to
find out exactly what the problem is? i would like to do the minimum to
get her back on the
road, seeing as im a college student and short of bread. what should i
not do? where should i work on it? what tools do i need (minimum)?
*sigh* i dont know if im
up to this...
