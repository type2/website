Coke will clean aluminum (heads, cases) nicely due to the phosphoric
acid, yes, but I must take issue with the statement by Jim Mowreader:
&quot;I don't think the little dab of phosphoric acid will hurt your stomach;
search for &quot;pH of bile&quot; to see why.&quot;
    -It won't hurt your stomach but will hurt your bones- both calcium
and phosphorus are needed to make bones, but there is a feedback
mechanism that will cause calcium to leave bone when an excess of
phosphorus is present.  It's been shown that &quot;cokeheads&quot; (or consumers
of lots of soda containing phosphoric acid) are more prone to
osteoporosis.  A study of juveniles driking lots of soda a day showed
poorer development of their bones, especially girls.......
