&gt;Removing Type IV engine from 78 bus for first time.  It is unclear to me if
the transmission must be supported while removing the engine.  What is the
best method of doing this while pulling the engine back from the tranny with
a floorjack?  Any suggestions on this matter would be greatly appreciated. 

The tranny supports itself - no need for additional support.  Same for any
72-79 US-spec bus with type IV engine.

I will second this. It will stay in place, check those rear mounts while
your in there. This only applies to the late Bus, you must support all 68-71
Trans.
