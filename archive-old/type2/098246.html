Subject: Re: [T2] Good karma, dead bus &lt;resolved&gt;

I'm just not cut out to be a car salesman. Wouldn't be
able to sleep at night. Besides, a 16-year-old who's
in love with a bus and a dad who's going to work on it
with him...I couldn't help myself.

&gt; Gee, money back warranty that covers abuse,

&gt; to sell?  :)
