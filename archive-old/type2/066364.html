Subject: Re: Type 1 engine in 72 bus

Stuart Neil rote:

&gt;        I have a '72 bus with a '72 bug engine.
&gt;        Does anyone have any suggestions on building some kind of whatever to
&gt;make a air seal around my engine.  The '72 bus engine is much smaller than the
&gt;hole for the '72 bus.

European spec buses were offered with the Type 1 engine right through the
bay window era. Because the Type 4 was so much wider, the 72 and later
buses with Type 1 engines had modified engine tin to fill the space. Maybe
you can find stock Euro Type 1 tinwork for your bus somewhere in the
States.

Sorry I can't tell you where -- if you ever need any VW parts in South
Africa I'll know ;-)
