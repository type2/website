&gt;   Same-o problem when first I brought my sick little Ramona home. Top speeds
&gt; of 30 mph on a freeway onramp. Lots and lots of burpy backfiring from her

I don't have any backfiring at all.

&gt;   Had TWO problems there; PO had put the wires on wrong and they were arcing,

I'm pretty sure the wires are on right, #1 above the notch in the dizzy,
firing order 1-4-3-2.

&gt;   Since you seem to have an extreme tenacity for parts replacing, mayhap you

&lt;guffaw&gt;

&gt; should begin again, and start with a new set of Bosch wires and some vacuum
&gt; hose line. Rule out the leaks first. Das cheap fix.

I did get new Bosch wires, yes. The 009 doesn't have any vacuum hose line.
