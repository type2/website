okay...i go to take the bus for state inspection.  i last drove it on 
tuesday.  since then it has been moved once by a third party (the owner's 
of the house that the bus is staying at.)

anyway, i get in and start him up.  i notice that the windshield wipers are 
half way up the windshield.  i tested the wipers on my way to my alignment 
appointment on tuesday and they worked fine.  i did not however use them 
when i got back....so, i am not the one that turned on the wipers last.

so, i go to use the wipers to put them back in their resting position.  no 
dice.  the motor is working, but the wipers are not moving.  the first 
switch on the wipers is a good pace (from the motor sound) and the second 
switch is much faster.  well, the motors sounds somewhat okay.

now, i go to put the wiper switch all the way down to turn of the 
motor....once again, no dice.  the motor is still running!  i can carefully 
position the wiper switch to stay between what should be off (now slow 
running speed) and the first speed position.

so, i didn't bother taking it for the inspection.

unfortunately, i cannot ask the individual that moved the bus...what he 
did, because he left for a funeral out of town yesterday and won't be back 
for awhile.

help!  i need to get this sucker inspected and the wipers obviously need to 
work for this to happen.  any input would be much appreciated!  i'm 
beginning to lose my patience.

thanks in advance.
