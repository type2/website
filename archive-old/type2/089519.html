Subject: Re: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size? Halon

Check the figures carefully, guys, one of the things that have to be changed
when changing from the traditional Halon systems to the more CFC free ones
is to increase the flow characteristics, as;

the BEST replacement needs to dump 40% more gas for the same retardant
effect, therefore you would have to replace a Halon extinguisher with one
about 50% bigger to put out the same fire.

&quot;Legal&quot; variants of the traditional Halon will still fall under the same
rules, so you need to check the retardant capabilities ( no idea how they're
recorded, I'm afraid ) of any extinguisher you're looking at to knock down a
fire of the same size.

&gt; Anyway, the deal with halon is that it's like freon.  R12 type freon is
&gt; bad for the ozone, so now we use R134 or some other type.  Well, Halon
&gt; 1211 can be had, and it most likely works just as well.  Here's a link
&gt; to a site that sells them...
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; They appear to have every size, including a ten inch tall, ten second
&gt; discharge one (for like, putting out cigarettes, or cooling hot
&gt; beverages, maybe?).
