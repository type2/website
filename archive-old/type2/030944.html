this seems to hold true with the auto tranny and FI also,  I have to make
a 140 mile drive twice a month on I-95 for work and I have been monitoring
my temp guage.    

outside temp seems to relate about 3-2 to the engine temp, ie; if the
outside temp goes up 30 degrees the engine temp seems to rise about 20
degrees.  

also the temp seems to go up about a degree for each MPH over 55 MPH, so
an engine that is running at 215degrees on a 60degree day at 55MPH becomes 
250 degrees at 70MPH on a 90 degree day!  

and at 110 degrees this becomes 265 degree engine temp, and I'm getting
REAL nervous (and slowing down!)

this of course is what I find at sea level in the East, up high where the
air is thinner &quot;may&quot; affect things too.

and of course  YMMV
