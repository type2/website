Subject: steering box concerns;(

--=====================_889472414==_

hey folks..having some issues with my steering box. not sure if i need a new one or what.?.? but the signs seem to be pointing that way.?.?
when i start turning my steeringwheel from its center position, it will slip a half an inch on me and then grab again with no problems through the rest of the turn. 
i have alittle too much play in my wheel right now. and haven't taken the time yet to mess w/ my adjusting nut. but i don't think that will solve this slipping problem. when i turn the wheels while the bus is sitting, it will slip and make a clunk sound in the steering. 
any ideas? and to add onto the last steering box post. if i need a new steering box, where would be the best and most reliable place to purchase one from?
thanks for all the help u all provide and for this wonderful veedub resource. still learnin as i go. 
a gr8ful peace out to everyone on this beautiful rainy oregon day. the morels will be poppin their heads up for days to come. waaaahoooo...!!!! 
*shine on* -Chris 70Westie 

btw; lookin for a 70'poptop, to replace my beat up top, if anyone has any heads up on one out there. peace!
