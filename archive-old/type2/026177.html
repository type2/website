Somewhere I heard that a brake booster could be added to pre-71 Busses as an
option.  I don't want to switch my '70 over to disc brakes but would like to
need a bit less leg to stop it.  Anyone ever done this conversion?  I also
heard that there is an electrical part I can wire in so I don't need to run
the booster hose all the way back to the engine.  True?  What parts would I
need to come up with for this to work?
