Subject: Rebuilding my Heat Exchangers

Hello List,

I want to thank everyone for the kind words of
encouragement about rebuilding my heat exchangers. As
soon as I get up from the computer, I am going out
side and start welding on them. The POR 15 should
arrive in the mail with in a few days so I want them
to be ready when it arrives. Y'all have given me a few
things to think about. I am hoping that the POR 15
will give off no fumes when it completely settup. I
will also try and get some of that exhaust puddy that
POR 15 makes to seal the seames. That sealer has got
to be better than the $1.50 stuff sold at my local
flaps. Any way, I will keep you all updated as I go
along. I will take pictures from here on out. It is
too bad that I didn't take any pictures of them before
I started. Oh well. THanks again!

David Kelly
