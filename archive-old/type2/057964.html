&gt;         TDC       10                             10       TDC
&gt;
&gt;Which is after and which is before?  If the crank turns clockwise I say the
&gt;first is before.  My 71 is timed the first way and I hope that is not wrong
&gt;it should be ATDC...

The above sentence seems to have no meaning. The first diagram does
illustrate timing 5 degrees BTDC under a strobe. If you understand this it
is not clear why you timed it according to that diagram when you really
wanted ATDC?

As the engine revs the spark ADVANCES, firing further BEFORE top dead
center. Check me by deploying your timing gun and pulling the throttle arm.
When it does this TDC looks as if it moves COUNTER clockwise under a
strobe. Therefore if you want to find 5 degs AFTER TDC it should look like
the second diagram, i.e. TDC would be CLOCKWISE from the seam.
