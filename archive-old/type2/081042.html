    Hi All.

  Just came in from doing a valve adjustment and when I pulled the =
covers I=20
noticed the old mayo in the valve covers. I have never had this problem =
before and
the last time I drove the bus (2 days ago), I noticed the oil temp never =
when above 160 degrees. This was on the highway 60 mph driving. The =
outside air temp has been around the freezing mark and I have always run =
Castrol 20w50.
I checked the thermostat and was able to take up a little slack in the =
cable.
This engine (stock 1700, dual solex ) has always run very cool. Except =
last summer
90 degrees outside air temp , 6 hours drive in heavy stop and go traffic =
oil temp reached 220 degrees. Should I change viscosity of the oil for =
my climate?
(southern Ontario) I think the 20w50 does great in the heat of the =
summer but its been cold here. I'm heading down to Ebus in a couple =
weeks and thought if the temps rise as I head south I don't want too =
thin of oil.
Any tips or changes I should think of making?

Thanks
