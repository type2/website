Subject: Re: [T2] Running in a new engine

Phil,

Check the archives also, but....

Main thing is to vary the engine speed and not let it idle a lot.

What is happening is that the rings are seating.  This means that they
are &quot;scrubbing&quot;(honing)  the walls of the cylinders in order to provide a 
more &quot;perfect&quot; seal.

I can't imagine anything else in an engine that gets better as it
rubs together....think about it....valves and valve seats might benefit a 
little, but if they have been put together properly, they should already
seal very well....everything else is just rubbing(with oil we hope)....

My opinion is to &quot;set&quot; the rings by accelerating normally up to about
35-40 then be in 4th gear and floor it until about 65.  I usually do this
several times, and if I can find a gentle hill to do it on, it is even 
better.   YMMV

I might treat it pretty gently till about 250-500 miles and then
rock and roll!  You &quot;might&quot; notice both smoother and more power...at least 
I always &quot;thought&quot; I did!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Ashley's new engine is being fitted today. Apart from regular oil changes
&gt; and not lugging it, any other advice on running in ?
&gt; 
&gt; I've never had a new engine before so I'm not too sure what to expect. The
&gt; supplier just said &quot;Don't go 70mph down the motorway straight away.&quot; which
&gt; is a bit vauge.
&gt; 
&gt; Should I limit myself to 50 or less ? How long for ?
&gt; 
&gt; What will I notice as the engine runs in ? More power ? Smoother running ?
&gt; 
&gt; What is happening in the engine while this happens ?
