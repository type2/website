Subject: L-Jetronic Tuning Question

Hello Everyone,
I purchased a '76(pre-february) westy a few months ago and I had a few
problems with rough idle and not much power on acceleration.  What I
found out is that the previous owner messed around with the AFM
adjustments, along with advancing the timing to, I guess, compensate for
a frozen breaker plate in the distributor.  After that was fixed, the
car started running much better, besides the 10mpg
problem.  After fiddling with the AFM set screw(under the black cover),
I've gotten it up to 17mpg, but I'd still like to do some more
fine-tuning.

So, what I am planning on doing is going over to the nearest shop with a
CO tester and doing some fine adjustments on my AFM.  I would like to
get the best milage possible so I know I will need to lean it out.  What
are the boundary CO readings that will give me the best milage without
running the engine too lean?  I don't know if it's possible, but can you
burn-up/overheat your engine if it's overly lean?

Also, has anyone tried using a K&amp;N airfilter on their intakes?  I was
reading a site linked off of TYPE2.COM and it mentioned that a K&amp;N
filters gives much better airflow than the stock filter.  Any words on
this?

Lastly, it was also mentioned somewhere that the AFM is a restriction to
airflow because of the flap.  Has anyone ever tried drilling holes in
the flap and reducing the spring tension?  Just a thought...

Later,
Mike Soultanian
