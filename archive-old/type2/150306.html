Subject: Re: [OVT] Starter continues on

Hi Frank,

I think you have the ignition wires confoosed. The ignition should be  
a 2-stage switch. Stage 1 is power to coil and accessories. Stage 2  
is a momentary contact that sends power to the starter solenoid.

The symptoms you describe lead me to the conclusion that you have the  
starter solenoid wired to the coil wire power.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hey Folks,
&gt; I had a 60 DC with 1600 DP hotwired and taken for a joy ride.  I  
&gt; just got
&gt; the wires re-connected to the ignition switch, and I have power,  
&gt; and it
&gt; starts.  Problem is the starter will not quit once it starts.  This  
&gt; is a new
&gt; issue.  Is it related to the wiring?
&gt; Anyone have thoughts or ideas?  This has been converted from 6v to  
&gt; 12v, and
&gt; yes as a novice mechanic, I do have wires left over, no clue where  
&gt; they
&gt; go...
&gt;
&gt; Thank You in advance
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Make it a Great Day!!
