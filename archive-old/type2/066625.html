Subject: The &quot;4 legged stool&quot;

I have the blue green stool in my 74 westie but have never heard of the   
center console other wise know as the trash can.   I would like to find   
the center console If it was a option for 74 and I am also looking for   
the collapsible spare and compressor,  electric fridge and stove.  Any   
out there?  Erick
