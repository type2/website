&gt;&gt;Yes, the doghouse fan, for instance, displaces about  35.000 Liters

&gt;
&gt;Those numbers seem awfully high to me.  I don't think 1000 liters per second could even fit through the air vents.

I pulled those figures out of memory, but just to make sure I pulled the 
1969 Engine manual from VW AG, there is an update page dated 11.73, 
It lists, among other things, the following figures on the amount of air 
that the cooling system displaces:

  D 1200        500/3600 (type-1 &quot;40Hp&quot;)
  H 1500        575/4000 (type-1 non-doghouse)
AD 1600 620/4000 (type-1 w. doghouse)
CA 1700 800/4600 (type-4) 
   T 1600       565/4000 (type-3)

The figures given are in Liters per Second/Engine Rpm. For a 1600 
type-1 with doghouse 620 L/S = 37200 Liters of air per minute _at_ 4000 RPM, 
through the cooling system alone. And yes, this is an incredibly high figure, 
that's why I remembered.


&gt;I think it may be possible for the engine compartment to be under positive pressure and still have air come in through the open engine hatch.  

I'm not sure, but I think that there is a low pressure area behind the 
bus while it is moving at higway speeds, and think that that is why it
 gets dirty on the back, gets oil stains on the back while it is only leaking 
a little bit from push rod tubes or something alike.


&gt;more airflow from my heater at 3000rpm on the freeway than I do at 4000rpm on the surface streets right before I shift from first to second gear.  The ram-air effect is definitely noticeable.

Thanks for the info.. never noticed it, I'm a single cabber.. *S*


&gt;You can't force more air through, but you can lower the resistance of the air that is being sucked into the fan shroud, and that is what I think is going on here. 

The the objective remains the same, get more air through the shrouding, 
I really doubt it is possible, the fan stops increasing the volume of air 
going throught the shrouding at a certain speed.. a certain Rpm, someone 
did testing on that, might be Bill Fisher or Gene Berg..


&gt;The transaxle does not run hot enough to significantly heat the air at the rate it is rushing by.

Ok, true, it would take actual tests to see what it does..
