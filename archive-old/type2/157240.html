 Mine is a direct connection, meaning it hooks
 directly to either the end socket of the wire going
 to the distributor or the actual socket on the
 distributor.  Here's what the directions say to do
 for a 12 volt battery:
 
 Connect the BLACK clip to the negative (-) battery
 terminal
 
 Connect the RED clip to a secure engine ground such
 as the alternator/generator bracket or the engine
 block.  For safety reasons, do not use the positive
 (+) battery terminal or fuel sytem components as a
 ground connection point.
  
 Are buses 12v or 6v?  If it's 6v it's gonna get sort
 of complicated.
 
 The brand is Actron.

Why did you buy that one?

You should get the CP2527 or the CP7504 or the CP7515
inductive lights. Pos, neg, and clamp on the plug
wire.

The CP7520 is so obsolete that is why it is reduced to
$10.99! The light output is dim.....
