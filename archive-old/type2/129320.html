Subject: Re: [T2] driving advice? + fuel lines

Thanks for everyone's advice, and I did change the fuel lines when it 
was sitting... last August in fact. Should I replace them again?  I 
would do the fuel pump myself, but also want this guy in Loveland,CO 
(Vee-W Unlimited)  to check out a couple of other things I'm unfamiliar 
with, and he's only charging me $40 for the fuel pump including labor, 
so I reckon he can get dirty instead of me (and maybe he'll let me 
watch!).

&gt; Thanks a bunch for any advice

&gt;gas in the oil can cause loss of lubrication, and in a worse case scenario
&gt;even could cause a fire...probably wouldn't hurt if you changed the oil
&gt;and just drove the 40 miles. but a fuel problem, especially if the bus has
&gt;sat for as long as yours has, begs for fuel line replacement anyway
&gt;
&gt;good luck
