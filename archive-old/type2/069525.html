Subject: Barndoor FireWagen (was Hemmings Motor News)

&gt;susan and rick crandall had their 55 barndoor firewagon at vintage meet.  the
&gt;rear hatch is a barndoor engine lid without the lisence plate dent, turned up
&gt;side down.  the engine lid is a shortened barndoor engine hatch.  thus there
&gt;are a pair of piano hinges.  extra lights on the back tooo.   last year they
&gt;kept blowing its siren and the blue light on top would flash.  :)

I saw that bus at Bug O Rama, and a couple things bug me about it:

1 - its trailered everywhere.  I guess I can't expect him to drive all over
hells half acre, but I dunno, maybe its me...

2 - for a bus of its caliber, it sure has a *crappy* paint job.  If you
spend $10k on a bus, you'd think you'd be willing to spend another $200 or
so for new window rubber, or at least mask it decently.

3 - He didn't really seem to know much about busses, barndoor or otherwise.
I got the impression from talking to him that he bougth this bus as an
&quot;aquisition&quot; and isn't really all that into busses.  I didn't get that VW
vibe from him, and that might explain why he put such a crappy paint job on
it...

I have pix of this bus, all ready to put up on my web page.  I bought a
scanner tonight (HP 4P) but the (%_at_*%s gave me a *Mac* (gag, spit,
hack,cough) version, so I have to take it back and exchange it.

I also have pix of Matt Henrick's pickup, too, to put up.
