Subject: weber specifications

I'm trying to tune up or adjust my weber carb to improve mileage and emissions.
Muir suggests that no off the shelf (what I have) carb for a vw is set up right
and I should look at a book called the Weber High Performance Master Catalogue
for infomation on jetting and performance.  No one I've talked to has a clue
about how to find this book... Any Ideas????  John Jensen in Annapolis with 56
