Subject: early rear hatch screens

to anyone interested I do make the early rear hatch screens originally
offered with the westfalia packages.  they fit all bus's with the larger
hatch after 63.  I also make them thru 79 and will soon be in production
for 63 and earlier.  all screens are $45.00 plus shipping and handling.
