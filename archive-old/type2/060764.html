Jeff:

If you search the archives for &quot;valve seats&quot; you'll find a number of
discussions that will be of interest to you.

I don't know if dropped valve seats is an inherent problem in new heads
from VW, but it certainly appears to be a concern on rebuilts, when the
seats have been replaced.  The better head rebuilders worry about this,
taking pains to ensure a very tight interference fit.  The best don't
let it go at just that, but stake the seats in place as final insurance.
