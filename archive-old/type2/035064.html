&gt; &gt;I don't have a lot of money to sink into this thing.  I've already

&gt; 
&gt; My drum beat this month: $4000 is not enough (I assume that includes 
&gt; purchase price).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone who gets a well-running bus for under $5000 is flat-out lucky,
&gt; or 
&gt; a shrewd and merciless negotiator. The minimum you can expect to
&gt; spend to 
&gt; have a daily-driveable, reliable bus is $5000. And that's the
&gt; minimum. A 
&gt; truly reliable vehicle -- one that's all but guaranteed not to break
&gt; down 
&gt; -- should cost you close to $10000 (again, that's Doktor Tim's figure
&gt; and 
&gt; I think he's right).
&gt; 
&gt; So at $4000, you're a grand short of the minimum.

My experience is a bit different.  I bought my bus 8 years ago for
$1300.  It had a bad steering box and a transmission that dropped out
of third, but was otherwise in good shape.  $30 at the wrecking yard
yielded a steering box and I lived with the transmission for quite a
while (it only dropped out of third when not under load).

I finally had the transmission rebuilt ($600) about a year ago.  The
engine was pulled once for a general tightening and engine tin repair
about two years before that.  I also replaced the generator ($45) while
the engine was out.

One of my valves suddenly tightened up, so I decided it was time for a
new engine.  the bottom end was pretty loose and the end play was way
out of specs, so a rebuild was dicey at best.  I just installed a new
mexican engine and carb along with a liestritz exhaust ($1450).

I also recently had to replace noisy rear wheel bearings ($130)  Over
the years, I have replaced two sets of tires ($480), a drag link ($40)
and ball joints ($200)

So, as I sit now, my investment has been
1300+30+600+45+1450+130+480+40+200= $4275

All of the labor has been my own, except for the rear wheel bearings
and ball joints, where labor was included in the cost.

I'm sure that I've forgotten an item or two, but it's clear that my
&quot;bus investment&quot; has been under $5000, and I have had 8 years of
enjoyment out of it in that time.  Everything is squared away now, so I
expect the next couple of years to be relatively trouble-free (sound of
knocking on wood).

Short of a bug, I can't think of any vehicle that has as low of a
per-mile cost as my bus.  It's never let me down on the road, and very
seldom needs the services of a mechanic.

The downside is that one has to be an attentive owner, not an appliance
operator.  This involves getting greasy now and then, as well as
performing some relatively unpleasant tasks (such as the 3-day engine
change marathon I just completed).

I suppose that if you use the services of a mechanic for everything,
the $5000 figure is more realistic, but I feel that most bus owners
like to do their own work.  This cuts the costs considerably, as well
as putting the owner in closer touch with their buses, which allows
them to fix minor problems before they become expensive problems.
