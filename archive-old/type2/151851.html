Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 Hot Air

Andy,

A pic of the right side on the bus here...

http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/newbus/picture-005.html

and Karl is right...pretty much your standard T1 heater hose type stuff, 
but check the size for sure as it fits *very* tightly on the ends.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi, All.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The '79 has pipes that carry the hot air that dumps out of the heater 
&gt; control boxes when the heat is shut off to the rear of the bus, and they 
&gt; look something like exhaust pipes, one for each side (wow! Duals!). 
&gt; Anyhow, the pipe is held onto the van with two bolts &amp; nuts into the 
&gt; bracket for the mustache bar, and extends up under the van toward the 

&gt; heater control but stops about 14&quot; short. Does anyone have any idea what 
&gt; goes between the pipe and the control? Some kind of flexible tubing? I 
&gt; don't remember taking anything off.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for your comments.
