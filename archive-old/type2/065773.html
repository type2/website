&gt;I'm sure I'll get flamed for this one, but '72 is by far my LEAST favorite
&gt;year of the bay-window bus. It was the first year of the pancake (&quot;type
&gt;4&quot;)motor rather than the upright (&quot;Beetle&quot;) motor.  Compared to the '71
&gt;bus, the 1.7 liter motor in the '72 was just enough bigger to be a major
&gt;pain in the neck to work on, and had just enough more torque to wear out
&gt;clutches too quickly, without having enough increased output to be worth
&gt;the hassle.  VW quickly realized their mistakes, and the next year added a
&gt;top access hatch for the motor (making the '72, the only year with a type 4
&gt;motor and no access hatch, the hardest year ever to work on) and a larger
&gt;clutch. By 1975 the bus was further improved with an even larger clutch,
&gt;improved brakes, fuel injection, and a 1.8 liter motor that had noticably
&gt;more power.  Also, from '74 on (and particularly from '76 on) the Westfalia
&gt;camper layout was much nicer.
&gt;If I were going to look for a camper, I'd either get a '71 (the best of the
&gt;bug-engined years), which has the identical layout as a '72 but a much more
&gt;reliable and easy to work on drivetrain, or a '76-79, which in my opinion
&gt;is the best that the Westfalia Bus ever got.  '74-75 ain't bad either.  But
&gt;personally, I would never want to own a '72 (I say, as I get ready to duck
&gt;the slings and arrows of any '72 bus owners on the list).

This isn't a flame, but I'd like to address some things Ron brought up.

Clutches.  I'm pretty sure that 72, 73, and maybe early 74's share the same
flywheel and clutch.  There was a short period that they made an
intermediate sized flywheel (215 mm?) before they finally went to 228 mm
around 75.  Now I'm not particularly easy on clutches, and my stock '73
clutch has lasted 8 years now with no visible signs of wear.  While bigger
is always better with things like clutches and brakes, I think the '72
clutch is entirely adequate to handle the torque of the 1700cc motor.  That
same clutch has handled the torque of my 2000cc engine also with no
problems.  I wouldn't consider the size of the 72 clutch a negative at all.

Access hatch.  I used to be from the camp that thought the '72 was a bad
year because it didn't have an access hatch.  My 73 has one, and honestly I
have not opened it in a couple of years.  I find I can do everything I need
to do easily from the rear hatch.  Some things, like adjusting the carbs,
could be done a little easier from up top, bu you have to open the hatch
and remove the bedding to get at the top hatch, and it's not worth the
trouble.  I no longer consider the lack of an access hatch to be a negative
thing.  A related issue: in '73 they started covering the roof of the
engine compartment with thin pegboard, which on most busses I've seen is
rotten and falling out.  In '72 they covered the roof with a metal plate,
which is stronger and doesn't rot.

Ron mentiones that the 1700 doesn't have the increased output to make it
worth the added hassle of working on a type IV.  Output isn't the only
thing to consider.  The type IV motor has an aluminum case and a built in
oil filter, which are both very worthwhile upgrades that the type I doesn't
have.  Yes, it's a little harder to work on, but now that I've been doing
it a few years, I really don't think it's that bad.  A few weeks ago I
managed to remove the entire intake and exhaust system, CV joints, engine
and transmission mounts, and drop the engine and tranny in my bus in about
an hour, by myself, with only a floor jack.  Yes, I'd like to have the
simplicity of the type I engine which can be removed in about ten minutes,
but to me the upgrades the type IV has are worth the extra hassle.  As for
the output of the 1700, it can easily be upgraded to 1800cc, and with a
little more trouble, you can turn it into a reliable 75hp 2-liter engine
that will still get 20 mpg and be indistinguishable from the stock engine.

Smog.  In California, the '72 is the only year of the dual carbs that
doesn't require a smog pump.  Not a big deal to most people, probably, but
it was for me when I lived there.  I was lucky because my '73 had been
brought in from outside of California (from where?  I often wonder) and
doesn't require the smog pump either, but most 73 and 74 busses are very
hard to get past emissions in California, where the '72 is much easier.

I agree with Ron about the Westfalia layout being better from '74 on, and I
also agree with those who say that '78 was probably the best year for
loafs, with '71 being up there also.  But, I think all years of breadloaves
are great and no year is really a lemon.  There are strong and weak points
for all of the years.  For example, the '73 has a lot of weak points
(California smog bs, last year of low geared tranny, less desirable pop top
layout) but some strong points as well (first year of bigger brakes, better
steering box. late model bumpers and front turn signals, paper air filter).


One last thing about 72's - I saw some sales figures which indicated that
there were more 72's sold than any other year.  Now I can't remember if
that was just for Westys, or just in the US (I suspect so) but regardless,
there are lots and lots of 72's on the road, which is a good thing as far
as parts availability is concerned.  72 is a fine year for a Westy - if
you're happy with the bus, go ahead and get it.
