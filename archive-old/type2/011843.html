Hi Volks!

&gt; Last year I bought the '69 Clipper that can be seen in the book &quot;The
&gt; original VW bus&quot; that most of you have. It's a beautiful original unrestored
&gt; 9 seater with about 60,000 miles on it's original 1600 cc SP engine. It
&gt; still smells 'new' so to speak. I paid about $ 7000 for it.

And that's a bargain price if I may say so.  This is one incredible
bus you have there.  -- My unrestored, not as-new but &quot;as-3-yr-old&quot;
if you will, '72 panel van cost a tad over US$2,000 at today's
dollar exchange rate, and that was *dirt cheap*.  They're still
around...

The perfect b-model Bus that the original poster mentioned would
probably be worth anything from DM 8k to DM 10k here in Germany,
maybe more.  Jan Willem's is an a-model, which are much more
sought after here.  But such Euro-only info might be pretty
worthless on the other side of the pond.

&gt; After that it's value may have been about $5000 to $6000. So, yes if you can
&gt; buy a completely restored bus (and know for sure it has been done right!) it
&gt; will be a lot cheaper that performing that restoration yourself unless you
&gt; or your neighbour happens to work in a body shop.

And even then.  The paint job alone will often cost as much as a
nice original bus would have.  A pal of mine just had his '69
double door, non sunroof Clipper welded and painted for upwards
of $5k, not including the numerous new parts.  And -- but that's
a matter of taste -- I'll always prefer original over restored
anyway.  They're not making any more of them, you know.  (Well,
yes, but we're not talking Mexican c-models here, are we?)

Conclusion: The best car is the cheapest buy, regardless of what 
its price is, if you want a really good one.  :-)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
