Subject: Re: [T2] Sand Blasting

Ray Ramirez sends:

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; I have recently decided to undertake the painstaking task of de-rusting the
&gt; floor pan of my 71' Bay.  Upon removal of the layers of house carpeting and
&gt; rubber mats from the floor I discovered a great deal of Rustolium covered
&gt; cancer.  I stared out with a stiff wire brush just to ware out my arm.  This
&gt; resulted in scratched up Rustolium and little to no rust removed.  Later I
&gt; obtained a &quot;Rust &amp; Paint Removing Wheel&quot; from the local OSH.  This worked ok
&gt; for a while, but after about an hour, my poor drill began to overheat.  Now
&gt; I'm at the point where it's time to get serious, sandblasting time.
&gt; Searching through the T2 Library I have found info on what I need.  I have
&gt; ordered the appropriate equipment from Harbor Freight and am awaiting its
&gt; arrival.  My question to you (list), where the heck can I find the &quot;#30-#60
&gt; copper slag&quot; in the Bay Area (San Jose, CA).  All the places I have called
&gt; only carry #30 Silica Sand (really bad on the lungs from what I have read).
&gt; Any info you could give me on Abrasive Media retailers in the Bay Area would
&gt; be of great help.

Ray, one of my customers makes Sandblasted Wooden Signs. He uses plain ol'
filter sand he buys by the truckload. His crew wear activated-carbon masks--
he tried the Dust Masks they have at Home Depot and the sand, wood chunks,
etc., went right straight through. They also like Tyvek bunny suits and
cheap chemical goggles. (On the goggles: chemical is the key point--those
don't have vent holes in the sides. Cheap is the word because they last
about a day, and they use motorcycle-racing tearoffs on them.)
