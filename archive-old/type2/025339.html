Subject: an oval drum?  or is my adjustment tool too short!  ; )

Background:  I (amateur) and Karen (amateur's girlfriend) replaced the
brakes on Russ, my '72 Riviera (terminally rusted junkyard find) in late
June abouts.  I replaced my oversized drums with 2 used ones that were
turned and measured as I stood there gaping.  2 new wheel cylinders, and all
new pads, clips, springs,  doo dads, rinky dinks and whatchamacallits.  I
did not replace the backing plates (though I tried) or the ebrake cables.  I
had the brakes adjusted and bled by Midas (never will I do that again).

Catalysts:  the rear brakes began squealing like a pig with its wedding
tackle caught in a whirly gig in late July.  They worked great before that.
Additionally, the ebrake which had worked, could now be pulled all the way
out without working enough to hold the car still on any slope.

What I've done: I readjusted my back brakes last night on my '72 and the
rear right brake acts odd.  When spinning the wheel, it rubs in one spot and
is loose in the rest.  It made adjusting the brake somewhat difficult and I
adjusted the brakes with the wheel in the loose area and not where it
rubbed.  I'm guessing the drum isn't round anymore.  The left side rear
brakes weren't ?warped?! but the bearings are about shot and it was hard to
adjust the brakes with the noise of the bearing rubbing.

Side note:  Both rear bearings need to be replaced and I've already bought
them, however I have neither tools or work space to attempt it.
Additionally, as Russ is so full of cancer, my mechanic said it would be a
waste of money to bother putting them in as the bus's only worth is the
engine and transmission.  I am in the process of getting another bus that I
can work on in earnest, but want to keep Russ going as well and
inexpensively as I can for as long as I can.

Is this pretty common?  Should I replace the drum asap?  How might the drum
have gotten warped and what's to stop the new drum from warping as well?
I've got to drive from Seattle to Portland and back again this weekend, will
the 'oval' drum be an inordinate danger?  Does Jesse love Julie?  Does
Julie's wife know of the affair?  Will Armando come back next season or jump
over to the Young and the Witless?  All these questions and more will be
answered on the next episode of  Shallow Rich Beauties in Heat.

TIA,
