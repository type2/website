Subject: Re: [T2] 71 bus- lower the engine without pulling it....

As I recall (I had a 71 Westy) you can undo the engine mounts on each
side and lower the engine WITH the trans attached until just before you
bottom out on the cv joints- did this all the time so I could access the
upper bolts by scrunching my body over the top- and I had a Holly-Weber
carb on that bus.  Rested the trans on a concrete block during engine
pull.

&gt; I recently purchased a 1971 bus for a 3 month long
&gt; journey this summer.  The previous owner installed one
&gt; of those silly weber carbrators, and a local guru told
&gt; me that it would be in my best interest to put an
&gt; original solex back on the van.
&gt; In order to do this I need to change the
&gt; &quot;brachet&quot;(part in rear that connects to the stock end
&gt; castings) that the carbrator is mounted on.  I was
&gt; told that I need to remove the generator and fan
&gt; housing so that I can access this piece.
