Subject: Under the bus heater info, please help me?

First, I'd like to say you people do a wonderful job of helping Type II
owners out!!!!  I have a '72 type II w/ a gas heater (I hope). All I know
about it is that it's a Manchester Co. tank and that it's located under
the cargo area.  There is also some kind of connection behind both front
seats (like the female one for air tools).  I would be VERY appreciated
if I could receive any information on this type of heater.  I'd
especially like to know how it works (connections, parts needed for it to
work, literature, etc.)!!!  I hope you can help.				


					 Thanks A Million,
							 Lyle T.
