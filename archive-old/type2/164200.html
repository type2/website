Subject: 71 bus driver's door window

I tried the library, and the archives don't seem to be working at the
moment, so I'm turning to the list for help with our '71 bus.
Can someone tell me how to get the driver's door window regulator and glass
out.
I've got the interior panel off and have removed 6 bolts that hold the
regulator to the door and the 2 bolts that hold it to the glass support.  It
moves all around inside the door but I can't figure how to get it out.  Does
the glass have to come out first?
The glass, I've got that out of the bottom support, or channel, but can't
for the life of me find a way to get it out.
Do I need to remove the hindged, wing window and the edge tracks/seals to
get the glass out?
I'm so frustrated right now I'd set the bus on fire except for the fact that
it's parked right next to the house.
HELP, Please and Thank You.
