This is a reply to a message that originally appeared in the Type II 
listserv.

I am wondering where I can get replacement gas line hose.  It seems to me 
that this is a generic type of item yet I know not where to get to get it.
What I really need is that rubber piece that hooks between the gas tank 
and fill nozzle on my 72 Super.  I was told by someone on the vintagvw 
'serv a while back to &quot;just go to any generic hose place.&quot;  Well out here 
in the sticks, all you have is a handful of &quot;good&quot; mechanics, a bunch of 
tractor supply stores, KMart, and a couple of lumber yards.  I am 
unfamiliar with tractors but would there be a suitable type of 
gas-resistant type of hose for tractors that would work on the bug?  Or, 
is there a mail order place that would have what I need? 

Sorry to come across at ditzy, but I'm really at a loss as to where to 
start and I am getting tired of getting asphyxiated everytime I drive the 
bug.

All for now...

Slater!
