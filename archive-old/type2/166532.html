Subject: Re: Engine cooling air

 &gt;I used to see a 10 degree difference in outside temps and
engine cooling temps. I now have a new engine compartment
seal and closed up any holes I could see where hot air
from under the engine would be sucked in. Aluminum tape
works great. Now I generally see about a 5 degree difference,
but that increases over time as I drive.

I was very interested to see this post. One of my hobby horses is 
that many of us (including myself) drive around with all sorts of air 
leaks between the engine compartment and elsewhere and then bitch 
about high head temps! Most of the problems relate to rubber gaskets 
that have perished over time or been removed by POs/mechanics and not 
replaced (as if!). I have been gradually replacing mine when I notice 
they are missing. The latest one is a rubber gasket at the top of the 
oil cooler. I only found out there should be one from &quot;the Samba&quot; and 
I'm fairly sure it wasn't there when I had that section apart earlier 
in the year.
