Subject: RE: Westfalia side tents (anyone want to buy one)

Being the former seller of this tent, I can vouche for it as described by
Glen. It was a little used but well worth the money that is currently being
mentioned.
It is a &quot;drive away&quot; tent with the grey flooring... Will work great with
Splitties, Bays and Vanagons.
