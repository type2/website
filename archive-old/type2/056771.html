Dooes anyone know of a source for the nose of a 68-71? The cataloges show
early bus and post- 73, but nothing for these years.

The bondo has now been removed from mine, and will take a sculptor to reshape
it. It will have to be inches thick, and I don't want that. Really bummin' as
I had no idea all that much was there. I must admit that whoever bondoed this
puppy the first time was a true artist.

I tried VW (I know) and the computer says none available, tried to call Das
Bulli and number disconected. There has got to be one out there somewhere.

If thing ever gets finished, it will be much like George Washington's axe.
Anybody heard about a fake splitty front for a bay window? I don't think I
could do it to her. 

How about cutting from a donor bus? Anyone done that?

Thanks, 
Ric
