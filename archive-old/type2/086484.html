Got a call today from somebody whose 75 bus would not go into gear, they =
thought clutch was out.  I rode out to give helping hand, and low and =
behold firm clutch pedal (felt good) and super sloppy  shifter that they =
said had been that way for awhile. =20

Crawled under and saw that they shiftrod was connected, but the shift =
coupling was kinda sloppy.....would this be enough to keep it from =
engaging, or could it be something in the nosecone?
