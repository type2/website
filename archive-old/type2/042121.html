Subject: 77 engine parts available

I've got a couple of spare '77 engines lying around, with all those
weird exhaust parts, plus a set of heater boxes in respectable
condition. I also have a 77 transmission, steering box and both front
doors. I'm moving in a couple of months, and they aren't coming with me.
The dumpster seems a sad fate. Any takers?

Can anyone confirm if the alternator and starter from a 77 will work on
a 72?
