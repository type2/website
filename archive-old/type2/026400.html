Subject: Another fuel line question


	While most California and East Coast listees may find it hard to
sympathize, I once had to fit 1/4 inch FI hose (6.4mm) in lieu of VW-spec
stuff (7.5mm?). That's all the APS (neither friendly, nor local) had and I
could not afford to wait.

	While I understand that the choice is not optimal, I'd like to know
*how* bad it really is. Specifically, (1) what would potential consequences
be and (2) how urgent is it that I put in the right stuff?

	Thanks,

	Sami
