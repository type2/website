Subject: re:[T2] breakin in &amp; heaterbox spring replacement

 and after sunday had nearly passed i wonder now what to put
between the two heaterbox parts for a gasket. ideas on what the factory
white stuff/ decrepitated crusty  was?

Do you mean the material that was between the heat exchanger and the cylinder
head? That's where a paper gasket --- or the remnants thereof --- should have
been. I've used paper gaskets for a seal, but I've had really good results
from using the high temp gasket sealant. You can get it at any auto parts
store for a few bucks.
