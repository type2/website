      David and List.

    The poor running turned out to be a number of snags.
I pulled the distributor and found the ground wire was unsoldered from the
breaker plate. This has happened before so this time was an easy solder job.
I re timed to 10degrees atdc It was a wayyy retarded:)
I reset the carb screws on the base of each carb to about 3 turns out and re
set the linkage for evenness. This has done wonders but I'm still getting a
small backfire through the R/H carb when I'm accelerating i.e.. giving her
the gas:)
What s the proper procedure to rectify this snag?

Thanks again David and others whom replied.

&gt; &gt;This am I fired it up for the first run up. Started good and after
&gt; &gt;adjusting timing and idle and checking dwell I go to take it for a spin.
&gt; &gt;Slight hesitation in first gear, shift to 2nd and It's like hitting a
&gt; &gt;wall! I feather the gas but the engine doesn't want to take it.
&gt; &gt;If I floor it, it sounds like it will back fire through the carbs. Can
&gt; &gt;only get about 15-20mph in second.  don't know what to proceed with.
&gt;
&gt; Sounds like the idle circuit is working and perhaps the accelerator pumps
&gt; too, but not the main fuel circuit.  Will it accelerate beyond 20mph if
you
&gt; pump the pedal continuously?  That would be a hint that the accelerator
&gt; pumps are working.
&gt;
&gt; I'm assuming the stock Solex dual carbs here.  There is no easy way that I
&gt; know of to test that the main fuel circuit is working.  What should happen
&gt; is that vacuum in the venturi should pull fuel through the the hole in the
&gt; nozzle assembly that sticks out into the venturi.  You might be able to
&gt; verify it visually by removing the covers from over the carb throats and
&gt; looking down into the carbs while you open the throttle (significantly)
&gt; with your hand, engine running.  Of course, this could get you into big
&gt; trouble if the carb backfires, so I would wear goggles and do it a few
&gt; times without your head over it first and see if you think at that point
&gt; that a backfire is likely.  You should see fuel coming out of the little
&gt; nozzle (not the thin brass one but the wider one which opens downward that
&gt; is blocking your view of the lower throttle plate).  If not, suspect a
&gt; plugged main jet or empty float bowl.  If you go as far as removing the
&gt; carb, you can take the top off of the carb and with fuel in the bowl,
shoot
&gt; a little compressed air up through the nozzle in the venturi and you
should
&gt; see air bubbling up from the main jet in the bowl.  Again, wear goggles
and
&gt; proceed cautiously.
