Subject: lower AND sway bars?

I know there are some out there who grimace at the thought of lowering a bus..so, if that's you, stop right here..
my question is..after lowering, do you still get the effect of sway bars if they are on, or do the sway bars become unecessary..better yet, is it possible to have it lowered AND have sway bars?  Is this going too far to get good handling in the VERY windy place I live?
Collie, any input on this one?
thanks all..have a good weekend.
