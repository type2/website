Let's get to the facts and not speculation..........

RMMW was and still is a solid supplier.  Great warranty they honored =
without hassle.  Pricey for the average Joe, but being a distributor for =
them, never had an issue.  Great distributor prices.

Great service oriented company.  Unfortunately, price is important to =
most people, and they would rather complain about slow service than pay =
a little more for fast service and a great warranty.  In my city, I use =
a local hardware store all i can for the service and the warranty =
instead of a big outfit such as the Home Depot.  When it comes to =
service, you get what you pay for.  When it comes to product quality =
over all they were pretty solid.  If i ever received something i did not =
like, they promptly refunded my money.

Quality of management/etc?  Cannot say here.  Seems that focus was on =
product and service, so they were way ahead of 95% of the vendors out =
there.  Boston Bob and Ken Wilford are the only vendors that i would =
give a higher rating to, for they have the same and or better service =
attitude. Keep a customer happy and they keep coming back.

I do not think ebay was an issue for them...the main issue was their =
troubles with vwoa over their apparel line.  I think the bankruptcy =
thing is to protect them against vwoa more than anything else.  Think =
about it...tough to get a big settlement out of someone with no money =
isn't it?  Put RMMW out of business?  Sure maybe VWOA can but a bankrupt =
company out of business....but it can't keep them from opening a new one =
doing the same business minding there p's and q's to the copyright =
thing.
