I just replaced my (broken) ignition.  Well, paid someone to do it
actually, as I am tired of crawling around under my bus after swapping the
heads last week.

check to see if that's your problem.  When mine started to go out, it
was hard to start, had to crank it for 10 seconds, then eventually it quit
while I was pulling onto the freeway (D'oh!).
