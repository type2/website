Subject: Re: [T2] looping thermostat cable

Stevewrote:
 list -on the upright engines, what is the most productive way to loop the
black cable from the fan shroud to the attachment on the air filter? my

Sounds like you have a 68-70 bus..... my advice would be to get a 71 only air 
cleaner. VW did away with the stupid cable and went to a themostatically 
controlled intake flap.
