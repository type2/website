VW Euro

One chance to meet bus owners from several countries in Europe will be
the -VW Euro- show in September (in Holland). See http://www.vweuro.nl It is
an aircooled VW event drawing about 4000 cars and a total of 10000 (yes, ten
thousand) visitors during the weekend. It caters for all kind of VW's mainly
bugs of course but there will be a fair number of buses. I recently joined
the organising committee (PR officer) so if you have any questions please
ask.
BTW: We are always looking for new sponsors and vendors.

Bus meeting in France.

There is a small scale bus meeting in France in 2 weeks. If you are in the
neighbourhood (Clermond Ferrand area)and would like to join up please
contact me.


My '69 bus

My '69 bus (the Clipper photgraphed for  'the Original VW Bus') has been
hired by a Dutch TV station to act in a comedy being shot at this moment.
It's use is to provide transportation for the characters that stay in this
'lunatic asylum' that is the theme of the program.
