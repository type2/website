Subject: Re: [T2] Double Cab Wood Slats

&gt;I'd just like to prevent any future rust from occurring.
&gt;
&gt;So what do you think?


Maybe use plumbers putty underneath.  I'd be afraid that if the silicone 
hardened and then pulled free even a little, that it would then 'draw' the 
moisture into the crevices under the wood.  Something that remains pliable 
would IMO be a better idea.  Maybe urethane windshield sealant.  It remains 
pliable.
