Subject: Re: [T2] Potential for you heater adjustment controls

From: &quot;Harry Hoffman&quot; &lt;hhoffman_at_ip-solutions_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Ok, so if I were able to get both blue and red controllers made how many
&gt; ppl would be interested in buying them and for how much?

Um... how many do you need?  $12.00 per set of two red and one blue.  $4.00
shipping on up to three sets.  Dave Bolen bought some earlier this year.

I'm still getting things together after a long period of low sales, but I
can probably work up a few sets if someone is interested.  The masters for
the levers can be seen in our gallery here:

From: &quot;Paul Manning&quot; &lt;paulmanning97_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
&gt; ... If/when you get to the ones that would fit a '72, please let
&gt; the list know. I had given up, and was planning on constructing handle
&gt; tips out of dice. I have sharp metal bars to control the airflow now,
&gt; so, needless to say, I don't change it much :)

Paul, I'm not sure what the difference is in the '72's heater levers.  The
ones I make will fit whatever takes heater levers that will fit a '77.  Do
you have pics of the '72 levers?  I'd need to acquire a set to reproduce.
