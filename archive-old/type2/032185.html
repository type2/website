&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Replacement is annoying, and oily if your
&gt; &gt; tranny oozes like mine, but not too complicated.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, if I read my Bentley right, which is always at least open to
&gt; discussion, it sounds as if the tranny will have to come out, then the
&gt; rear half of the shift rod, before the flexible coupler can be replaced on
&gt; the shift rod.  Is that right?  [If so, I'm a little in awe of David B.
&gt; for his calm, Gary Cooper-esque sense of what counts as &quot;not too
&gt; complicated!&quot;]

--&gt; &lt;grin&gt; Fear not, the tranny doesn't have to come out.  In fact,
you'd have to disconnect that thing to get the tranny out, anyway.
It's not a complicated thing to do, but here's my suggestions on how
to go about it, based on my massive amount of experience. ;)  (Well,
okay, I did it once, on my '75.)

Undo that little brass setscrew on the transmission side of the coupler. 
Push the shift lever all the way forward -- this will move the coupler as
far back as it goes -- then pull the lever as far back as it'll go.  This
will probably pull the coupler right off the tranny shift rod...if not, it
will come off with a little twisting and working it back and forth. 
There's enough room to get it loose, you just have to get the tranny shift
rod in its rear-most position.  Once it's off there, you &quot;merely&quot; unscrew
the bolt that holds it to the other rod, and pull the pin out.

If your rubber blocks are all that are shot, you can probably get away
with just removing the bolt that holds the pin, pulling the pin out, and
replacing the blocks; that is, if you can get that bolt out.  It's a self
tapping bolt, and on mine it was siezed tight.  I had to cut the
sheetmetal part of the coupler to get enough room to get at it with a pair
of bolt cutters.  If yours is this bad, be prepared for a lot of cussing,
as there's not much room to work in there...it *will* come out, one way
or another, though, and you'll be surprised at how nice your shifting is
when you put the new one in.  You may find you need to adjust the shift
lever a little, afterwards, if someone tried to compensate for the bad
coupler by adjusting it.

It's probably easiest to re-attach the new one's setscrew side before you
put the pin in; I did it the other way, but found it a tad frustrating to
work it back onto the rod with the other side already connected.  Don't
forget to safety-wire the setscrew, there are holes in it for just this
purpose.

If your coupler is all globbed up with old tranny fluid, spraying it down
with WD-40 to dissolve the gunk, then wiping it with a rag, will make it
easier to see what you're doing *and* a little less messy.
