Subject: champagne edition

I have recently purchased a'78 Westy, which I have been informed is the
champagne edition.  My bus is brown and white, but all of the
information I've been able to locate on the Web talks about a brown/red
version.  Is my Westy truly a champagne edition, and if so does anyone
know its true value.  It's in very good conditon not perfect, but very
good.  Also, it is an automatic.  Can anybody help me?
