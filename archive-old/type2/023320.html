Subject: Re: [T2] misadventures of a vw mechanic wannabe

Had a roommate that insisted that cigarettes couldn't start fires with 
gasoline. These were 'goodolddays' when we were in the Navy and beer was 
generally involved.

He would always insist on proving it when he had a few and I hadn't and I 
was cleaning parts (hands in gasoline sometimes).

This led to many hot conversations!!! (no pun intended).

Another episode, another friend, BMW that had sat for a long time.

I am cranking the engine over with the key, pumping, some popping through 
the carb. Friend thinks more gas from bottom will help. It popped again and 
lit the carb, the bottle, and him. He dropped the bottle, gas/fire 
everywhere, and ran away.

We were in Italy and I quickly realized that I did not know the Italian 
words for fire (Fuoco). Couldn't ask for a fire extinguisher at the shop we 
were working beside. Grabbed a mechanic who saw the situation and threw me 
an extinguisher. The BMW was gridlocked between other cars so now we had 
several cars with fire under them.

Got the fire out, got my friend out. No damages beyond soot and some 
blisters on his right side - head to toe.

Took him to the Navy hospital. They took a complete report. Navy gave my 
the Navy Achievement medal. I didn't want it (for that), told them, and 
then slept through the ceremony (worked 12 hours night before).

Department was very pissed, several other guys got retirement and 
advancement certificates but no me. Wanted to write me up but they decided 
the paperwork would read a little funny.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;some days, I feel like im getting somewhere, and with my manual by my side I
&gt;&gt;can do anything.
&gt;&gt;that is, until I don't have my manual by my side, and try to do something I
&gt;&gt;assume can only be just as easy as other projects I have taken on.
&gt;&gt;The project : replace fuel filter
&gt;&gt;The mistake : not reading my manual first
&gt;&gt;The outcome : lots of gas all over the place
&gt;&gt;I really hate to admit it, but damn this was a dumb, and rather dangerous
&gt;&gt;move on my part. I am trying to get ready for my trip to the grand canyon
&gt;&gt;from san fran, so I went to change the points/condenser/rotor/oil/oil
&gt;&gt;filter - I set the timing, and decided to change the fuel filter since I had
&gt;&gt;an extra one and some spare time, after all it couldn't be that hard, or
&gt;&gt;take much time.
&gt;&gt;I crawled under the bus, found where the old one was and pulled off the
&gt;&gt;hose. damnit, the CLAMPS, the CLAMPS!!! ahhhh, grab bucket, place under bus,
&gt;&gt;contemplate if the gas will continue to pour out, or just stop when however
&gt;&gt;much is in the hose comes through. I realized it was going to continue, so I
&gt;&gt;wrapped a towel around my face to help with the fumes, found the hose
&gt;&gt;spraying gas, and bent it in half. I tied a rag around it to keep it
&gt;&gt;pinched, and grabbed the garden hose. I doused the gas that had spilled onto
&gt;&gt;the ground with water, hoping to some higher power that nothing would ignite
&gt;&gt;it. I decided to play it safe (sure, now!) and call the FD. They came and
&gt;&gt;just decided there wasn't really that much, and hosed the rest of it away
&gt;&gt;for me, instead of using any chemicals to spread around on it. I watched
&gt;&gt;from the side, my head hung in shame. I now reeked of gas, and had half a
&gt;&gt;bucket of it that I don't know what to do with. How do you dispose of
&gt;&gt;gasoline properly? I don't think I want to use it, since the bucket had
&gt;&gt;little dust and stuff sitting in it when I put it under the bus. I'll figure
&gt;&gt;something out, for now, its covered and placed out of the way.
&gt;&gt;For future reference, what would have been a good clamping devise? I locking
&gt;&gt;pliers perhaps?
&gt;&gt;I will never ever make that mistake again.
&gt;&gt;My Lesson : RTFM (read the freaking manual)
