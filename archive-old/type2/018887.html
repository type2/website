&gt; I finally fixed this same problem on my 72 after I smashed my finger pretty
&gt; bad while trying to open the door.  The fix:  after unsuccessfully spending a
&gt; whole day tearing the door apart and making all kinds of adjustments as per
&gt; Robert Bentley, I discovered that all the door needed was a little WD40
&gt; squirted into and around the hinge/arm.  It seems that over the past 25 or so
&gt; years, the grease in there turned to glue and was binding everything up.
Dan, Phil:
This is my experience exactly. Actually, if you have your OWNER'S manual
and read it religiously, you'll see that it says to oil the hinge arm
pivots regularly. (That's oil, not WD-40, which is mostly kerosene!) Too
bad someone didn't do it 5 years ago.
I've taken many of these apart on both loafs and Vanagons and found them
to be seized or nearly so with rust or corrosion.
This involves removing the rear rail cover (take out the screws, tap it
up with a block of wood), and removing the sliding door. It's pretty
easy, but it helps if you're big or have a good helper.
The hinge arm may be seized in the rear block or the front attachment to
the door and it's good to remove the nut and washers and then squirt
WD-40 or other penetrant in and work them back and forth. If they are
totally seized, I've sometimes used a propane torch to help things
along.
Be careful not to burn anything up. The pot metal castings can melt
under the heat of the torch, too.
I've seen some so tightly seized that  the steel hinge arm actually
twisted off. (You don't even want to know how much these parts cost from
the dealer!)
After freeing everything up clean it up and lube with waterproof white
grease (I like lubriplate in a tube).
You'll be amazed at what a difference this makes!
