After repairing the pan and applying a few caots of epoxy paint,
I'd also lay down a few layers of plastic onto which add a box or two of
Arm-N-Hammer baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). This will neutralize the
acid water from the battery. I usually replace the bicarb and plastic
twice during the lifetime of the battery (4-5 years).
