Subject: Re:VIN # and stableizing rust

One suggestion is to stabilize the rust by physically cutting it out and 
replacing it with good sheet metal. That works really well. Everything else 
is a compromise.

With regard to other approaches to rust stabilization.........You can 
browse this site and use their products, as a system. Lots of people do it. 
I have had good luck with it on my own vehicles, where I have tried 
it.  http://www.por15_dot_com/Default.asp

Others will suggest different remedies.

Hi all,
My son and I are making progress on our 74 bus.....snip...............
Finally, we are going to work on getting the body stabelized over the summer.
What is the best way to stabelize rust? Any ideas.
Bill
