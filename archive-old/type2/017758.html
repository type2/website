I'm with Al on this one.  Full is better than empty.  We all know the
gases are what ignite.  I hate the Idea but filling the tank with water
is the safest route I know of.  But the possibility of rusting is great.
( hard to get all the H2O out)

Good luck and be careful.

P.S. Harmon, you are a lucky son of a salty sea dog if you ask me.
Never heard of boiling gasoline.
