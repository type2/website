Subject: faking a vacume leak?
Message-ID: &lt;3787849A.5BAC90BD_at_hometech_dot_org&gt;

Hi List,
I have duel dellorto's on my 72.  It's acting like there is a vacume
leak on #2.  The mixture control screw has no effect on that barrel and
when I partially block the top of the carb over #2 the idle increases.
Also getting an intermitent poping out the top of the carb.  As far as I
can tell there are only 2 places for a leak, the head to manifold and
the manifold to carb.  So far I've replaced gaskets, used sealer on
gaskets, checked for cracks in manifold and carb, rebuilt carb (all
passage ways and jets clear).  Also, I just recently put in new rings
and brand new heads.

My question is:  Would a worn cam, lifter, rocker arm, faulty dizzy,
broken ring, stuck valve, etc. cause similar problems?  I've been
tearing at my carb for days now and can't seem to find anything wrong.
Thanks for any help, I'm stuck
