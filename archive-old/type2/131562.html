Subject: RE: [T2] Engine/tranny install advice

I use my floor jack. I place a 2&quot; x 10&quot; board long enough to span the Heat 
Exchangers. I jack up the bus and put it on jack stands I think mine go up 
to 16&quot; and i place them under the Torsion Bar Tubes. This gives me plenty of 
clearance, ask Rob Henley. He was amazed at the room I had to get the engine 
in and out.

I have never removed the tranny but this should be plenty of clearance. Wes 
Brown has used the ramps several times and never had to pull or lower the 
tranny either.

&gt;Those of you with newer (non-removeable valance) Bays who have pulled your
&gt;engine and or tranny.

&gt;Have you done it without help?
