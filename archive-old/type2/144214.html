Sounds like you have it right.

&gt; &gt; If the stock belt ends up being too loose,
&gt; &gt; check the pulleys (did a PO
&gt; &gt; slip a &quot;power pulley&quot; on there?), the clamp on
&gt; &gt; the alternator stand, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Pulley is 6.5 inches in diameter and appears
&gt; stock.  Is that a power pulley?

Not a &quot;power Pulley&quot;, but seem small. The OD of the late model pulleys is
7&quot;.  That might fix your problem!

&gt; My alternator now seems to REALLY be making
&gt; noise.  I think it is already shot.

Sounds like.  I've had alternator bearing problems.  Swap it out, replace
the crank pulley, and all should be good.
