Subject: wont go into 3-4 78 bus

Hi fellow bus nuts I bought a 78 yesturday that im planning on useing the 
engine for my 72. The owner of the 78 said it had no 3,4, or reverse It does 
fine in 1,2 when you shift into 3rd it goes into 1st and 4th goes to 2nd. Im 
thinking the linkage may be screwed up or something. If the trans ends up 
being good I will put it in my 72.  I got it into reverse today the shifter 
move around like crazy.  I pulled it and put it back on can I buy that plate 
under the shifter. Any ideas?
Thanks
RAy
