Pat and Tom:
so, ok then: a flycut is made to increase the diameter
of the hole to change from a small bore to a larger one.
a compression cut is what you have.
.018 deck height was too small to be safe, allowing for
expansion of the piston when heated.
.060 shim adds to the deck height, and reduces the c.r.
because the measured volume applies to the squish area.
your rockers hit the valves w/ no adjustment possible
because the heads were cut too deep, and the engine
bolts together narrower. now the push rods are too long.
also the muffler mount is off by 1/8 inch.
the misshapen head chamber is no longer what was originally
designed for good burn. if you notice, the machine shop
opened it up around the spark plug, because it is easier,
and now the spark is gonna do a 180 to catch all the fuel?
don't tell anybody you heard it here, but you can make that
junk work if you shim the rocker stands to restore valve
clearance. the geometry is quite incorrect as well as
several other parameters, but hey- you could go get some
good heads. the index measurements can be made from them
to determine how far off yours are, and when you see how
nifty they look, you just might want to use the good ones...
