&gt; I tell you that while you
&gt; probably wouldn't take her home to Mom, she at least has decent table
&gt; manners, geez not only did I have to deliver her bus I had to feed her too.

I don't recall *you* doin' the cookin'.... :-)

And he's right. Ya probably wouldn't take me home to Mom -- unless
you're a junior high school girl who thinks women who work on cars and
act like kids are cool. Every time I meet a parent, they go, &quot;Oh, you're
Nikki! All the girls do is talk about you!&quot;

Patti of the Parts Palace, where I stopped to get bumper bolts (help
meeee) said this sounds like a wonderful mentoring thing and I should
get publicity on the human interest angle, like it's a youth project or
something. Might keep the city off my back. Maybe get some donations.
Mebbe I shoulda hit her up on the spot.... ;-)

I met personally with Sgt. Martinet, er, Martinez, and politely
reiterated my situation and assured him I was doing everything I could
as quickly as possible, and please let's set up this probable cause
hearing. I also politely told him that if they're going to start
enforcing the law after three years, that I'll be more than happy to
call them out each and every time one of my neighbors parks in the
alley. :-P Hopefully, the bus will still be there when I get home. Eep.

LAPD told me I could have it on the street as long as I move it every
coupla days.

Chuck stated that &quot;No Parking&quot; signs in the alley would've been a big
help. L.A.? Hello? You listening?

I seem to recall Ed Hintz's mom at least got some notice....

Nikki
