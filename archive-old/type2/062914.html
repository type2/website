Okay,

Here's the scoop:

&gt;&gt;For Sale: 1959 VW type 2 ambulance. All original white. Low miles.
&gt;complete. Was
&gt;&gt;used as a campus ambulance for Princeton University. Some accesories include:
&gt;&gt;side retractible cargo door step, rear tow hook, windowless inverted rear
hatch
&gt;&gt;for sliding in stretcher, roof mount red cross light, frosted side windows,
&gt;&gt;sliding glass cab divider, jail bars on ALL side windows, and a bunch of other
&gt;&gt;original ambulance acessories.
&gt;&gt;

There are a few holes in the floor, some rust in the rockers...&quot;Rust in the
doglegs.&quot;

Rechromed siren for the roof. Heli spotlight mirro. Maltize cross and
another NOS in the box. All latches like NOS, sheetmetal for repairs. All
the documentation, manuals to go with it, etc., etc., ...

If you've been looking for an ambulance, you'll want to check into this!
BUT...although it sounds like this is a complete ambulance (with the
exception of some metal for the floors), there's still a lot of work to be
done to finish it up.

Guy would separate bus and some of the NOS stuff he has for it. Has lots of
pictures he'd be happy to send, if you'll toss a few $ (like 5) his way.

&gt;&gt;ALSO FOR SALE:  1965 VW type 2 firewagen with optional sliding cargo door. Low
&gt;&gt;miles.  All original red paint with handpainted original fire dept. coat of
&gt;arms
&gt;&gt;and lettering in German.  Imported from Germany 2 years ago from son of
&gt;original
&gt;&gt;owner of firehouse. Some acessories include: sirens, roof mount lights, upper
&gt;&gt;side marker lights, euro taillights and headlight lenses, plus many other
&gt;&gt;original firewagen accessories.

No engine, tranny out. Not near as good as the ambulance.

Good luck! Joe

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am posting this for a friend who is liquidating some of his personal
&gt;&gt;collection due to too many vehicles. I have seen both vehicles and they are in
&gt;&gt;very nice shape and complete. what he is asking for them is very
reasonable and
&gt;&gt;I'd buy them if it weren't for the fact that I already have 5 VW's.  
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;For more info, pictures, and prices, you can call him at (610) 926-6031  (Pa)
&gt;&gt;and ask for Curt. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;thanks,
&gt;&gt;chris
