&gt; FWIW i have heard (from Anthony Gelato FWIW) that these &quot;tools&quot; while
&gt; popular and convenient are
&gt; not able to torque the nut on sufficiently. You might want to consider
&gt; getting a*long* (i.e. 6 foot) cheater
&gt; bar and a 3/4&quot; drive. The 3/4&quot;  and the 46mm socket will prolly be the
&gt; more expensive route though.

The tool in question has a 1/2 inch drive hole that you can put a
breaker bar into. From there you put your *cheater* bar on, put load on
it and frap hell out of the wrench; the nut *WILL* come off. This is a
good tool to have!

I would not try to use it to tighten the nut with out a torque wrench.
Your torque wrench will fit into the tool, and do the job right.
