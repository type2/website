&gt; Hello list!
&gt; I am sad to say, that it is time to sell my 1978
&gt; Westy. It is very reliable, but needs some minor work.
&gt; I bought it two years ago, and did a compression check
&gt; at that time. The engine is strong, about 125 lbs in
&gt; each cylinder. It only has approximately 138000
&gt; original miles on it. 
&gt; It needs a seal for the pop top. The canvas has a
&gt; small hole in it. The bed on top is in good condition.
&gt; the fold down bed in the back works well.
&gt; The fridge works, as well as the burners on the stove.
&gt; The sink pump is not hooked up, so I have no idea if
&gt; it works. It has the camping stool, but no child's
&gt; cot.(missing when I bought it, but the anchors are
&gt; still there.)
&gt; I did the front brakes, and the clutch was rebuilt
&gt; about a year ago. It is the 2.0L engine with hydraulic
&gt; lifters. (no valve adjustments necessary.) The pushrod
&gt; tubes leak oil, as well as the oil cooler.
&gt; I am not saying she is perfect, but with very little
&gt; work, she would be a great camper!
&gt; The body is almost perfect, the previous owner backed
&gt; into something, and there is a small dent in the left
&gt; rear behind the bumper.
&gt; By the way, It has a great heater, no worry about
&gt; fogging up windows!
&gt; The interior is real nice, and still has the bug
&gt; screen for the back, as well as the front curtain.
&gt; I could go on about this, but if you are interested,
&gt; personal e-mail me at santori1_at_cs_dot_com for more info.
&gt; It is a steal at $2000.
&gt; Thank you.
&gt;
