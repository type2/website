Subject: '71 engine removal - info on net?

Hello,

I have decided to pull my engine, clean it up, give it a good checkup, tune-up, and whatever other -up's I can think of, and I was curious if there were any sites talking about engine removal on a 68-71 bus. I looked on Type2 and to my surprise, I didn't find anything...maybe I am just missing it.

Anyways, any web pages, or simple hints and tips would be appriciated...

I will take many pictures and document how I did it, then place it on my web site for anyone to see, if they wish.

Thanks!
