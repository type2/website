Subject: Re: [T2] Re: 79/78 buses

 &lt;I bought a 77 (out of state to Cal) couldn't transfer title and ended up
cutting it up in my garage. Quite a learning experience.&gt;

Sobering thoughts, indeed! However, with this particular vehicle, it would
be scrapped. I would just want the engine and tranny, possibly the front
end, servo, etc. This particular bus is not worth restoring, even though
it's had no real body damage. It's was a transporter, but no seats or
interior left, and it is very rusty overall and super ugly. The only good
thing is that it runs excellent and has very good brakes. As long as I get
the pink, I can trailer what's left down to the scrap yard and they'll take
it. I wouldn't touch anything without a valid pink, under any circumstances.
