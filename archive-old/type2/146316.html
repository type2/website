miles in question exactly the same?

Briefly, Stephen, your gallon, the Imperial Gallon, is about 20% greater in
volume than the U.S. gallon ... so translating abit for purposes here in
the U.S. you're averaging about 17.5 mpg combined driving, which seems
about right ... your top highway mileage translated for the U.S. would be
about 22.4 mpg .... 

FWIW the whole gallon/pint thing is a bit strange. The British pint is 20
ounces, the U.S. pint is 16; which would SEEM to make the Imperial Gallon
25% greater, except that the British ounce is slightly SMALLER than the
U.S. ounce, so a 20-ounce pint in Great Britain is only 20% greater than a
16-ounce pint in the states.  

The confusion can be traced to a time when there were two competing
gallons--the wine gallon (231 cubic inches) and the ale gallon (282 cubic
inches) in common usage. The U.S. seized early on the wine gallon while
Great Britain later opted for the ale gallon.

Hope this helps all trying to figure miles per gallon using different
gallons. Now when it comes to miles per litre, or kilometres per Imperial
Gallon .... 

Cheers,

John
