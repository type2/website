Listers,

It's getting cold in Maryland, so I decided to winterize my '79 camper (read getting the heating system to work).

Getting the fan to work only took some Liquid Wrench and a new 16 Amp fuse (is that the correct one? It's the one I found in there, but I don't trust my PO's mechanic).

My passenger's side heater box is in pretty ugly shape - the seam facing the engine is non existent, and the tube coming down from the fan has pretty much nothing to be bolt onto.
A couple empty cans of Boddington's (my housemate drinks that, I stick with decent beer, but good beer comes in bottles only) solved that. Slice the cans open and wrap the aluminum around the heat exchangers, secure them with wire (I used 18 gauge).

My right heat control box was in pretty sorry shape, too. Turns out, that 2.5&quot; flexible tailpipe makes a nice replacement for both the control box and the pipe from the heat exchanger to the control box. I used an extra clamp and some heavy wire to rig it to the cross member so it wouldn't interfere with the driveshaft (the driveshaft can move up quite a bit).
This might be a good replacement for sound control boxes, too. My driver's side one is solid, the flap is close all the way, but still some hot air is lost there.

I think of adding a JC Whitney heat defrost assist kit (http://www.jcwhitneyusa_dot_com/products/54zx1489.htm). 
What is the list's common wisdom on these kits? I have suffered through two German winters with a perfectly intact heating system, but still ice on the inside of my windshield. I always had hot air, but just not enough of it.

Has anyone out there a spare '79 passenger's side heat exchanger for sale/trade? I want to get those Boddington's cans off my car soon.

Cheers,
Marcus
