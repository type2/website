Subject: Re: [T2] Tyres a write off?

Tubes are not suitable for modern tire and modern speeds. Can cause alot of 
friction inside the tire and blow outs. At least this was how it was 
explained to me.

Lastly sidewall cuts cannot be repaired safely.

I've seen it done but I wouldn't feel good about it.

That's my $.02.
