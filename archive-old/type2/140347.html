Subject: Re: [T2] SVDA install troubles

Thanks for responding Jason and Don.Engine was at TDC #1 cylinder and rotor
pointing at notch in the distributer when I pulled the old distributer
out.Vacuum can on new one wont let it notch in distributer anywhere near to
having the rotor point at it at TDC #1.The whole thing just looks
backwards.It does run like it is though.Just when you are at TDC for the #1
cylinder  the rotor doesnt point to the notch on the dizzy.Its actually 180
degrees out.So are the guys at aircooled_dot_net on vacation? Three days and two
emails to the customer service email address and no response.
