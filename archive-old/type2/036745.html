Hey there Bob,

Great place to start. (some interesting threads in the archives.)

&gt; It seems that there is not enough oil flow there to get a good temp

VDO has a temp sender for the sump plate. It involves drilling a hole
in your sump plate (not to be confused with the oil strainer plate).
I bought a pre-drilled one from bus boys. I didn't want to screw my
original one up by drilling the hole in the wrong place. (try
searching on sender AND sump for more info on this).

&gt; Any opinions and experiences out there?

I was thinking of mounting my guages *in* the dash (under the radio),
but after the recent talk (and for the sake of originality), I'm now
thinking of mounting them in an over the dash pod. The vintage guys
go crazy about their dashboards being cut up, and I just can't see
cutting into the dash, even though I've already bought the bus boys
in dash mounting trim.

Hope this helps,
