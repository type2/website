Subject: Selling Dakota: a little long...

List,

I've come to the hard decision that I must sell Dakota, my '78 Deluxe Westy. 
I have a (10 year) large stash of NOS parts and accessories including a drive
away tent and freshly rebuilt 091 with a Lock Right unit (built by Weddle).
I'd like to sell everything to one person, preferably a list member who
intends to finish her up and drive her all over like I was going to but,
the various pieces may be worth more separately and I'll go down that road
if I have to. Anyway, the basics are:

1978 California Westy Deluxe (P26), Dakota beige
132,000 miles all in southern CA and CO so 99% rust free
Freshly rebuilt trans. with locker and .82 4th gear (&quot;freeway flyer&quot;)-out 
Freshly rebuilt BA6 gas heater with belly pan and spares-out
Factory air with complete spare system and Sanden conversion 
Spare '76 motor with 2 liter and '74 Porsche style heads
Enough brown plaid cloth to redo complete interior

Plus enough parts that you'll have to bring a trailer.

Please contact me offline for more info. If you're interested in
specific components do let me know but I'll only sell parts that way
if a &quot;complete&quot; buyer doesn't appear. I'd like to get $5,000 for
everything, one way or another.  Some of the expensive &quot;single&quot; components
would include:

A/C system with Sanden 550
New OEM steering gear (!)
Fresh Rebuilt BA6 + belly pan
091 with Lock Right
Drive Away Tent (like new)
Spare engine/heads
New front end with new brakes

I have contacted a guy in CA who offered to buy it some time ago but if
he can't get it together in the very near future it will go to the next
buyer.  Sorry for the extra bandwidth...

Craig in Colorado
