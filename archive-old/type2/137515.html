&gt;Despite my 6 years in the Navy, I can't make that one work. 
&gt;They both have 4 letters. I smell a joke here... &lt;grin!&gt; 

No joke intended.  The explanation I was given was that it works 
*because* they both have four letters .. though it takes thought

Dad might've given me the &quot;kiddie&quot; explanation .. or it might be
that his Navy enlistment was in 1958.. :-)
