&gt;The PO had a spliced mess of wiring to the VDO gauages. I want to replace

&gt;wire

Sean:

I'm re-wiring my 71 with teflon wire from a company in Gardena, CA called RDS Wire &amp; Cable.  It's cheaper than I thought it would be.  I bought 5 different-colored rolls of 18AWG wire, at about $10 a roll.  This particular wire will carry 25 amps, since it's teflon-coated, as opposed to only 10-15 amps for PVC wire.  Also, it will outlast the bus.  Here's the link:

Give them a call and see if they have anything that will suit your needs.
