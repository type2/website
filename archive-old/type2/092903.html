Subject: Re: [T2] Type 2 Odometer

But what they don't know won't hurt them...


&gt;In most states that use the odometer, if it is other than the original or 
&gt;has rolled over it is marked at time of sale that miles are not 
&gt;actual..this is even if it has been reset to match an original number.

&gt;&gt;How difficult is it to crack open a 69 Type 2 odometer. Mine went out and I
&gt;&gt;want to set the replacement to the same mileage so there won't be any
