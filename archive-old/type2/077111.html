&gt; I have been following your foot prints in a Westy 1979.  I left California 
&gt; October, 2000, and I drove down to Mexico and Central America.  In Panama, 
&gt; I got the bus in a container and sailed down to Cartagena, Colombia.  I 
&gt; drove to Caracas and from there, I have been doing the Caravana steps!  I 
&gt; am in Buenos Aires now and I need some technical help.  Until now, I have 
&gt; had no even a flat tire (love my michelins, half life when I left the 
&gt; States) and some minor adjustements, I have taken care of them myself.  The 

&gt; problem that I am having now is one of electronics perhaps?  The thing is 
&gt; that wen I start the bus when is cold it starts right away no problem.  
&gt; But, when is runing for a while, and lets say that I stop at a gas station 
&gt; and I turn it off, then it does not start again!  I do have power and if I 
&gt; puch it it starts right away.  Westy is fuel injected and a part that seems 

&gt; like a transistor box and which I believe is related to the starter, was 
&gt; broken once before.  Nobody had the part in Guatemala, so a tv repairman 
&gt; solder it back together.  I do not know if it is the same problem know.  I 
&gt; did review the same part and seems ok.  Someone told me that perhaps is my 
&gt; fuel pump.  


Please pmail this person with any advice you might have to help resolve his 
problem.
He is not in a good place to be without his camper right now. 
TIA
