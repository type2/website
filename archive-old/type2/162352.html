&gt; Problem is that in some states, like TN, different municipalities have

&gt; they banned it.  Chattanooga was going to lose a lot of federal money
&gt; unless they started emissions testing.  But then TVA is burning coal by
&gt; the metric megaton to keep the power on.  Cheers....KR
&gt;

we have emissions testing in Maryland and it varies by location, but we
only have a half dozen or so &quot;STATE&quot; emission testing centers for the
entire state so you get your emissions test and it is compared against
your regs, actually if the vehicle  is already registered the computer at
the test center knows what standards your vehicle has to meet.


&gt; &quot;??? I thought cars are registered by states, not counties?  I can go to a
&gt; DMV office anywhere in my state to take care anything&quot;

then take test report to MVA (DMV) and they go by your zip code as to what
standard you must meet.  with computers how hard is it??
