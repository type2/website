&gt;Hey Volks!
&gt;I am very happy to be a part of this list as well as a first time Westy
&gt;driver! Anyhoo, here is my question. I'm looking to add some gauges,
&gt;to get those or should I just make'em myself? One more thing, does anybody
&gt;want to buy the sink and fridge combo?It's in great shape but I needed the
&gt;space in the bus,it is just sitting now. Thanks alot.



I just happen to be looking for a new sink cabinet.  Where are you located?
What'cha want fer it?
