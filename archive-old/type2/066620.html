Ya know, until I got my gas heater from JB's Heater Service, I used to 
drive, at 8,600 ft above sea level in the High Sierra, wearing an 
expedition down jacket that was rated to 70 below! Everything I wore 
ended up having little down fibers on it. I started wearing a &quot;driving 
shirt&quot; under the jacket to keep my ski school uniform clean! But, those 
days are GONE! I LOVE my heater and I have tips on how to deal with Joe 
at JB's... I know he has a pretty raspy reputation with this group, but 
he treated me just fine. If any of you would like to know how to deal 
with him, let me know... I don't mind helping out... I know how 
FABULOUS his heaters are and you have to admit, he's just about the 
only game in town!

As we speak, here on the shady shores of Twin Lakes, ice is forming and 
it's a toasty 18 degrees F. I just took the Old Girl to town and her 
heater cranked so well I had on ONE shirt and leggings! YES!

Here's to the pending winter... and AWESOME ice skating here at 
Tamarack, soon! Maybe the next CCC should be up here for some skating!
