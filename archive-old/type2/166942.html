Subject: Re: [T2] Need a '79 head in WA

THE 79 head is a one-year-only head.

79 head part numbers:
029-101-371A left and 029-101-371B right

80-83.5 part numbers:
071-101-371A left and 071-101-371B right

  Actually, there is another square port head as well, I own one somewhere, it is cast with an 039 p/n which would to me be a 2.0 liter porsche number? but is 101-371x suffix like a regular VW bus/vanagon head.  It has &quot;vanagon head&quot; sized valves with square exhaust ports and of course regular old VW plug angles.  The one I happen to have is off of Dolan's '80 vanagon and was presumeably one of the original heads from that early (metal rear cooling grille) vanagon.  I posted a picture of the p/n once on type2_dot_com years ago, probably long lost.  Anyway adds to the confusion, as does the fact any 029 or 071 head could at any time have been rebuilt with about any size valve seats/valves.
   
  To the original poster, if you read this pmail me, I likely have a spare around somewhere but have gotten away from most of my aircooled vanagon parts, it is in AK, will a T4 head fit in a flat rate box, maybe?  Year and condition are unknown so it would be use at your own risk but if I have one it is something I thought would be OK to use or for solid rebuildable core, I don't keep junk.
   
  John
