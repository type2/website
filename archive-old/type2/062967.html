     That metal disk biscuit is your decell valve.  Don't ask me exactly 
     what it does, I'd have to look it up, but I am running a 76 FI 2L and 
     I know where the hoses on mine go.  On the side facing the charcoal, 
     there are two large hoses.  The larger one, closest to you, curves 
     around sharply and runs into the big 'ol rubber s-boot that connects 
     the air cleaner to the intake air distributor.  Hoses from the oil 
     breather and from the aux ir regulator also hitch to the s-boot here.  
     The smaller hose runs down to a T connection at the REAR left side of 
     the intake air distributor.  One end of the T connects there to the 
     intake AD and the other runs left out forward out through a hole in 
     the tin.  The other face of the decell valve has a small vacuum hose 
     running to a T connection, one end of the T to the fuel pressure 
     regulator and the other to the REAR left intake air distributor, just 
     above that other hose I mentioned.
        I was a bit like you, throwing in this engine and not knowing at 
     the start where everything went.  I just read manuals.  This set up is 
     working grandly for me, hope it helps.

Since my rebuild my '77 westy (2L FI engine) has been starting hard.  I 
labeled every hose and wire well but two small hoses failed to get marked 
and I believe they might be part of the hard starting problem.  I found what 
seemed to be correct locations for them but I could be wrong.  I know what
you are thinking, &quot;just switch the hoses around&quot;.  Well I can't remember where 
one of them is.  So here's were you folks come in.  On my '77 westy there is
a metal (goldish color) disk attached to the &quot;firewall&quot; just to the lower 
right of the carbon filter box thing.  It has at least one small hose attacted
to it maybe two.  I believe the thing may be a pressure regulator or something. 
Does anyone know where the hoses to that are suppose to go to/ come from?
Also, when I removed it I was unable to get the gold disk to sit horizontal 
upon installation.  Does anyone know if this matters to the operation of this 
&quot;thing&quot;.
Any help/information greatly appreciated, 
thanks
