Hi Chris,

&gt; Some dumb questions.

Not at all dumb. &quot;Dumb&quot; would be driving 800 miles without asking...

&gt; First, what is the best place for US attendees to exchange US
&gt; currency for Canadian?

You will get a good exchange rate at the duty free on the way across 
the border. That's where I get mine. You can also get local currency 
from ATM machines if you're on the same network as we are. (I usually 
have very little trouble getting cash from US Machines). That way you 
get whatever the immediate exchange rate is.

This is the page I use:
http://www.rbcroyalbank_dot_com/cgi-bin/travel/fxconvert.pl

&gt; How many quarters do we need for a family of
&gt; four? :)

Figure a full shower to cost about 3 or 4 quarters per person. Multiply 
that times the number of showers you need.

&gt; Second, what does this statement mean?
&gt; &quot;There's also extremely limited hydro available.&quot; There is no water
&gt; available at the site and we should bring our own?

ELECTRICITY:
&quot;Limited hydro&quot; = 4x110V plugs per picnic shelter. We have two picnic 
shelters available about 200 yards apart. Medical needs get first 
priority. I reserve one circuit to light the main shelter with xmas 
lights, and another for the PA system. We can put splitters on these 
but we still have a maximum of only about 20-30 amps total per shelter.

WATER:
After the water treatment disaster in Walkerton Ontario in 2000 
municipalities in Ontario had to review their water testing procedures. 
The Conservation Authority looked at what it would cost to continually 
test the water at Heber Down and balked. They shut off the main water 
tap and they marked the washbasins at the outhouses as being &quot;not for 
drinking&quot;. It's probably completely safe, but if they''re not going to 
certify it as such I certainly can't. So the park asks people to bring 
their own drinking water.

Luckily there are Bug_pack members who live within 10 minutes of the 
site, so we usually take a large BUNCH of water jugs over there and 
fill up once or twice a weekend.  I am also looking into getting a 
500-gallon water trailer brought in.

&gt; Third, shirts sound like a great idea. Can they be prepaid along with
&gt; the camp fee?

SHIRTS:

Hell Yes!   In fact, this was one of the main reasons I put the shirts 
back on the program, because it would give people more incentive to 
send $$$ . The $2 discount off the gate rate just isn't worth the 
bother for most volks to put a cheque in the mail, but it really helps 
when I can bring money in ahead of time. Plus the shirts generate 
profit that helps support the event. BOTC is a non-profit project... If 
I have any money left over afterwards it goes to support type2_dot_com

&gt; Do we estimate the exchange rate when we send the
&gt; payment or is there a more scientific way to do it?

I think you can send $Cdn with paypal, or you can use an online 
currency converter.

&gt; Thanks
&gt; Chris

No Problem, I'm glad to answer any and all questions. Would you mind if 
I forwarded this to the other lists?

Happy trails,
