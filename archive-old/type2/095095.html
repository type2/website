Subject: Re: [T2] Looking at my first 78 Westy

Hi

Rust on the engine door, rear hatch and sliding door isnt a major problem 
IMHO fix it how you see fit. Ideal solution would be bolt on new rust free 
panels and paint, alternativley cut out the rust and weld in repair 
panels/patches or just fill it . These three areas arent structural so if 
your short on cash after buying the bus, rubbing down filling/bondo and then 
painting is an adequate fix for a while. If you can buy waxoil in the states 
this is excellent stuff to put inside doors and panels to stop rust re 
appearing from the inside ;-).

The rust on the panel below the engine hatch is a little different. Id count 
that as a structural part of the vehicle, so new a panel welded in place or 
cutting out the rust and a steel patch welded on would be a safer option if 
it has any holes in it.

Neither of these 4 areas would stop me buying a bus, but if it has rust in 
these areas id be having a good look underneath the van. Places i would 
check under the van would be front valance inner and outer, front cab steps, 
cab floor, inner and outer sills, outriggers, chassis rails, rear wheel 
arches, rear valance which you state has rust on the outside, and the front 
axle.

When it comes to surface rust under my bus, i would use the Ruststop 
chemical stuff if its a small area, otherwise id use a red oxide primer, 
followed by a water resistant top coat, then a thick stone guard and then 
waxoil on the top :)

&gt;2. I'm pretty new to fixing up old cars but really want to learn. This bus 
&gt;I looked at had pretty bad rust on the engine door, panel below that, rear 
&gt;hatch and sliding door.  Since I'm no pro at welding/bondo are these pieces 
&gt;I could probably pick up off another bus or parts dealer?  And for 
&gt;controling the rust, If most areas are just surface rust, I should be fine 
&gt;with sanding the areas down and priming right?  Should I use that Ruststop 
&gt;chemical stuff - does it really help?
