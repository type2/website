Subject: [T2] Insurance  (was DMV woes)

Hi
   Actually I was trying to get around the RV plate thing more than anything- 
although it's cool that this spun off into an insurance thing. 
    My insurance agent  (an independent) doesn't care whether it's a westy or 
not- the way my insurance works with him is-  I bring down any VWs I 
purchase- he takes 5 pictures of it- 1 on each side, then 1 interior shot - 
then asks me how much I want to insure it for. Then I pay a premium based on 
the &quot;stated insured&quot;  amount, as far as collision and comp goes.  Liability 
he bases on &quot;collector car&quot; rates- which require me to store them &quot;primarily 
in the garage&quot; (whatever primarily means). 
    My liabilty ends up being about half the amount that it costs me for our 
daily driver cars.
   FWIW- I used to be with State Farm. Had them for 8 years. Never had a 
particular problem with them- but a few years back I got on the phone and did 
LOTS of comparison shopping. Found in general here in Wis- that independents 
were cheaper. And my agent seems more personalized than those big companies 
can ever get, of course.
