Subject: [UPDATE] Odd sound from carb

I just went out and set the valves. Some were a bit tight and some were 
a bit loose, but nothing major and all have been set to .006. Started it 
up and no change in the sound. I kept coming back to a possible intake 
leak, but to be honest it sounded wayyyy to loud to be one from my minor 
experience with the intake leaks I have had. I then took off the air 
cleaner to check for some suctions from the vel stacks. Nothing! (or 
very very little). A slight opening of the throttle and it sucks like 
crazy. So it appears It is definitely an intake vacuum leak. I would try 
the starter fluid trick if I had any, but do not have any here at work. 
I have used the fiber gasket that comes from CB Perf twice and the first 
time it hardened and cracked causing a leak. I suspect that this time I 
will find the exact same thing.When I took my dual solex kit off I did 
not have an extra metal gasket and used the provided fiber gaskets 
provided with the Dellorto kit. I should have known better and will pay 
the price by having to remove the manifolds again.  I did check and the 
manifold nuts are tight, so it must be gasket related. I am still 
stunned how loud the sound is though. Thanks to everyone who offered up 
some great suggestions towards a solution, if this isn't the issue I'll 
write back.
