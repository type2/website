Check the resistance specs on the coils per Bentley:

      CA high - 2400 - 3500 ohms, low  - 0.52 - 0.76 ohms
non CA high - 6000 - 12000 ohms, low - 2.6 - 3.1 ohms

These values may apply to some earlier FI also, such as the '79 the 
borrowed coil came from temporarily.  These are SIGNIFICANTLY
different values between the coil used for the Hall ignition versus 
conventional points as used in the '80-'82 FI engines.  The Hall 
ignition has very different requirements, &amp; I for one would not like to
risk frying that system, so a new, correct coil is $72, the old one 
lasted 16 years, and I expect this to be a long term investment.

I would rather you vote against me than not vote at all.
Get out and VOTE on November 5th (USA folks that is !)

&gt; &gt; money department.  And it's not like those T4 coils are the
&gt; &gt; Bosch BlueBoy $20 Special.  If I could find an inexpensive
&gt; 
&gt; T4 runs dandy on a 12 Blue coil with the stock distributor,
&gt; even the FI ones.
