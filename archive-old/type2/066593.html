Subject: Pictures of the my 75 Camper on the internet.

H. Steve has been very gracious to post pictures of my bus and tent. I
haven't been able to view them but my girlfriend saw them today and
says they are very good.  Although I am not in the pictures, in the third
one is my girlfriend Melanie and my black lab Hagerty.  These are three of
my biggest loves so take a look. Once again I thank H. Steve and also
there are other cool pictures as Steve has stated and per my girlfriend!
