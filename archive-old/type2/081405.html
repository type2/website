Subject: 82 Vanagon heads

Here is the story:

    Noticed a general lack of power so did a bit of looking about.

Timing spot on.

Compression check:

1 = 0
2 = 110
3 = 115
4 = 110

Symptoms:

No excess crankcase pressure
Wet (gas) but clean spark plug in #1
#'s 2,3 and 4 have lots of black soot on the plugs (too rich)
No back-firing out the exhaust, even with some small leaks in the exhaust.

My thoughts tend to lean towards a bad valve, but which one, intake or
exhaust?

Also, for those with the experience, should one drop the engine to remove
the head or can I do it with the engine in place?
