Subject: CDI from early dodges into VW?

So what is stopping me from going to the wreckers and picking up one of the
early 74 - up CDI systems from a chrysler product and using it in my bug?
Just wondering, as CDI seems to be pretty generic. My 79 Omni had it with a
coil and a Halls pickup in the dizzy. Is this do-able?? in conjuction with a
Petronix or Compufire?
Regards,
Courtney
