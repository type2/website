Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for Alternator Conversion Kit for 71 Westy


	Just out of curiosity George, why do you believe that a powerful auto 
stereo would have to be 'annoying'?  I have personally installed dozens of 
automotive audio systems, and I have never designed one that I would 
describe as 'annoying' to listen to, let alone &quot;very_annoying&quot;.  As for 
amlifiers drawing power in terms of wattage, they are actually rated as 
drawing amperage.  A typical, high current, class A/B two channel amplifier 
will draw between 30 and 50 amps(apples) of current at full output of its 
rated wattage(oranges).  (This is only at peak levels as you correctly 
state, but the averave current draw may still be rather large, compared to 
the rated output of the alternator, especially when you account for lights 
and other accessories.)  Much of that power is lost as heat, but the thermal 
resistance is not really a factor for this discussion.  Running two or three 
of these(not uncommon) in a triple crossover design would triple the current 
draw from the battery.  Add an air conditioning compressor's charged-clutch 
coil(30 amps), and what you have is a severe deficit in supply relative to 
demand.  True, a power inverter is usually active when the vehicle is not 
running, but it is another load on hte aforementioned batttery.  Adding a 
second battery(typically a deep-cycle) is a good idea, as they are more 
specifically designed for heavy current draw, and deeper load cycling.     
My statement that a larger alternator would be a good idea, especially if 
you are adding  multiple loading devices to the charging system, seems (to 
me)to be 'sound' advice.  Oh, the statement that a 75 amp alternator doesn't 
charge a battery faster than a 50 amp alternator, is as correct (when taken 
to extremes) as stating that a 1 amp trickle battery charger doesn't  charge 
a battery any faster than a 30 amp battery charger.  While it is once again 
true, that a battery has thermal resistance to too much amperage, the 
difference between the two alternators output, when considered in 
conjunction with the load(or loads) placed upon the battery in question, 
should still be considered when making 'upgrades' to a VW aircooled 
electrical system.

&gt; &gt; a good idea.
&gt;
&gt;Not really, unless you are running a _very_ annoying stereo.  A 50A
&gt;alternator produces 600W of power.  Raising this to 75W raises this number
&gt;to 900W.
&gt;
&gt;Few stereos, even the nasty ones, pull more than 100W
&gt;continuously.  They advertise much higher power levels, but those are peak
&gt;levels (such a when reproducing a drumbeat).
&gt;
&gt;Air conditioning only pulls electricity for the fans and clutch, which
&gt;don't amount to a lot of current.
&gt;
&gt;An inverter may utilize the added current, but you could easily exceed the
&gt;output of either alternator.  Inverters usually run off of the battery
&gt;with the engine off, so the alternator doesn't make much difference.  A 75
&gt;amp alternator does not recharge the battery any faster than a 50A
&gt;alternator.
&gt;
&gt;The 75A upright alternators are modified units and I have doubts about
&gt;whether they truly produce that current and whether they can do so without
&gt;overheating, since the cooling provisions are the same as the 50A
&gt;alternator.
&gt;
&gt;I have an 80A alternator on my C*evy truck and I've never
&gt;seen the ammeter go above 20A even when the battery is discharged.
