Some vehicles work will with only a fluid flush and a new reciever / dryer.
Others have kits with the required conversion pieces, different calibration to
the expansion valve, etc.  When the compressor broke on our 85 something
else,  a full flush and replacement of the reciever / dryer and expansion
valve was called for so I converted to R134A three years ago, no leaks. Very
cold air output.  My 78 something else developed leaky hoses last year and
after replacement, I recharged with R-12.  The R134A may not have been the
cause of the leaks, the age of the hoses and o-rings may have contributed.

&gt; &gt;  Have you actually ever converted an old R12 system

&gt; My Volvo was converted five years ago.  No leaks.  Works great.  The Ozone
&gt; and my son are happy and I have a clear conscience.
