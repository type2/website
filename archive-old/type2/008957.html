Greetings,

I'm just about out of ideas on this one, so I turn to your incredible knowledge.

Symptom:  Engine cuts out (hesitates, coughs, sputters, etc...) during acceleration at about the same RPM in each gear.  It is happening just as I'm reaching the upper RPM of each gear, right before I should shift.   I can give it more gas and accelerate through or back off the gas and it catches.   Clear?  It's more difficult to put in writing than I thought.

Things that I've done:
New fuel filter, plugs (Bosch Platinum) cap/rotor/points.  Dwell set to 47 degrees, timing=7.5 degrees BTDC.  New vacuum hose connections.  I switched back to the old Bosch Super's, it didn't improve.  If I advance the timing, the affected RPM range is increased but still present.

I've searched the archives and have covered most of the things discussed there.  Please help.  Could it be the vacuum advance on my distributer.  I don't have an Advance Timing light, so I'm not sure of the setting.  If I can't fix it, i&quot;m going to have to bring it in.  I'm getting kinda frustrated!!

TIA
Rob
