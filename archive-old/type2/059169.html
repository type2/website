  Subject: engine removal problem and question

  Help!  I can't get the brace out.......
  Here are some stats first:  It's a '69 campmobile with a stock 1600.
  Here is the problem........The brace that attaches to the
  rear of the motor (FIF) and to the rubber motor mounts will not
  come out.  I supported engine, removed the three bolts in the
  center, removed the two nuts from the rubber mounts and the
  brace will not come out.  It is free to move around a little until
  I begin to slide it up and off the studs on the mounts.  Before
  it is all the way up and free it binds between the body frame
  on either side.  It would appear that the bus has been hit slightly
  from BOTH sides at the rear and the body may h  ave been
  seriously injured.  The brace appears to be slightly bent on
  the drivers side.  Any ideas besides beating the crap out of
  it or cutting it??


A couple of stupid questions...

First, why are you attempting to remove the rear carrier *before* taking
the engine out of the Bus?  If you have the engine-tranny nuts/bolts off
and the two bolts that go into the rear carrier from the bottom out, the
engine ought to be able to slide right on out to the rear.  Once the
engine is on the floor, taking the carrier off ought to be a snap.

Second, I'll assume that you have a good reason for wanting to do this
prior to yanking the engine.  You did remove the crankshaft pully, didn't
you?  I suppose that it might be doable to remove the support without
touching the pully or the tin that goes in front of it but it seems to be
additional work.  I certainly think you do a better job of putting the
crankshaft pully on and off with the engine on the ground and a flywheel
lock to seize the whole shebang up while you crank on the torque wrench.

Third, there is a way to give you a heap more play in the rubber engine
mounts.  They are attached to the carrier at the top by a stud that comes
out of the rubber unit.  If you take off this nut, there should be more
flexibility in the rubber thingies.  I've had to had them pretty loose in
order to install the engine in a Bus that also had its rear carrier
support brackets damaged.  Once the bottom bolts are in, the top nuts and
the bottom bolts can be tightened in synch.  Also, try beating on the
rubber things.  They can be replaced if need be and moreover, even damaged
they do their job within acceptable limits.  I had a Bus with both mounts
in two pieces (the rubber had split) but life went on.

Fourth, if what you say is true (and I don't disbelieve you, just want to
confirm), that you have taken off the three bolts that hold the carrier to
the engine and the two bolts that hold the carrier to the support brackets
and there is nothing obvious in the way (pulley or lower pully shroud tin)
and you have the engine raised via a jack but no amount of grunting or
groaning will remove the bracket beyond a certain amount of movement, then
you have two options that you should try in order: 1) Take the engine out.
You can use your jack to lift the engine-tranny-carrier combo surprisingly
high.  If you go high enough, you should be able to clear whatever binding
is happening in the support brackets.  Once you get to the proper level,
make sure the tranny is supported by another jack then pull the engine
out.  Once the engine is just to the rear and free of the tranny, you can
lower it.  Just remember that you'll have to reverse this in the install
if you don't beat the support brackets into a better position. 2) If that
isn't doable, then beat the crap out of it.  I can't see how this could
affect the engine one bit since the bolts that attach the support to the
engine are out.  Get two sledgehammers and a friend and whack both ends of
the carrier simultaneously.  Try not to put any stress on the T-2 bracket
mounts though.  Once free, whack the brackets into submission and into
their proper positions.
