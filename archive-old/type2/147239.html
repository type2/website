Subject: Re: [T2] POR-15 binstead of underseal

I chose the wrong product at first too. A product called Corro-Seal I think
it was. It went on and was the usual latex carrier with phosphoric acid in
it. Supposed to turn the rust into magnetite with a hard glass finish, but I
could see little rust specks already forming. Bad choice. Not durable either
 plus it needed to be topcoated with another paint. The POR-15 can just be
left as is.
Take care,
Courtney

True, Not likely to have a brake line leakage very often. 
I'm still planing to use por 15 on my 75 bus exterior floor pan. 
I think it's the best option since I wasn't pleased at all with cool patch
when I brushed on the interior pan. 
After a few days i Noticed through the white rubber like finish there were
rusted spots showing around hwere the original floor paint chipped. It seems
that it may be water based and promote the oxidation. Not sure. I may
choosed the wrong product.

Really? Wow, never tried brake fluid on it. It's been exposed to oil and gas
but not brake fluid. Will have to try this out. But realistically, how
often is brake fluid going to spill on the pan of a VW?
