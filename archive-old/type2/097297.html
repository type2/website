Subject: Sudden loss of Door trigger Function

Hello all, quick question, if I may?

Just got a roadworthiness check on Tigger ( '74 Supro Campmobile ) today, and
when I picked her up from the garage, the driver's door handle door release
trigger stuck ( as it's done a few times lately ), but when I freed it up this
time, it was no longer working the lock.

The internal door release is still working, and the key lock &amp; button lock are
working fine, just the outside door release trigger's stopped. I couldn't see
anything when I looked in the door cavity, I didn't have any allen keys with
me, so I couldn't remove the door handle for a better look, and Bentley's
doesn't say much about it.

Soooo, my question is, is the door release trigger mechanism likely to be
broken, and hence the door handle will need replacing, or is there any chance
that something's just come loose, and I'll be able to put it back, together
properly when I pull the door handle off? ( Obviously, the latter would be
preferred, but if I need to start chasing parts it'd be good to know ASAP. )

Any advice and/or information would be gratefully received.

Thanking you in anticipation.

Regards,
