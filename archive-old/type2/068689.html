&gt; Perhaps I should have pointed out that this was a '78 Westy I was
&gt; working on. The book states (Haynes manual) to put the engine in without
&gt; the gearbox being unsecured from the chasis. Tell you what, try and
&gt; install your engine with the gearbox still attached to the chassis, then
&gt; come back and tell me you had a great time!

There's obviously a difference between the '78 bus and '81 van I'm not
aware of.  In my van the trans is secured to the chassis _only_ by the
transverse bolt.  The rear of the trans bolts to the front of the engine,
and the engine is secured to the chassis by a rear carrier bar.  Since
the rear sheet metal of the car body can't be removed, there is no way
to remove the engine without lowering the rear of the trans.

&gt; 
&gt; Following your example is basically what I did. However perhaps the '78
&gt; differs as I now have to refit the rear tin plate somehow. If I had left
&gt; this attached I would not have been able to tighten up the two gearbox
&gt; bolts. I guess the '81 design makes that a bit easier.

I'm in over my head, since I've never worked on a '78.  I can't imagine,
though, that you'd put the rear tin (are we really talking about the
*front* tin, the tin that lives near the engine/trans junction?) on *after*
putting the engine back in.  

&gt; 
&gt; By the way the fuel tank was very easy so I don't know why you say its
&gt; the easier of the two. I'm still sticking to my words, if you follow the
&gt; book... its a bitch!

In the van, the fuel tank is positioned under the chassis in such a way
that you're forced to work &quot;blind&quot; up over the top of the tank (in about
2&quot; of space) trying to make various connections.  I'm sure during manufacture
the tank was installed before all the running gear so that assemblers 
could work behind the tank, reaching up over the top to make these
connections.

&gt; 
&gt; How do you tighten up the gearbox bolts, is the design different in that
&gt; there is no tinware in the way?
&gt; 

I'm not sure what bolts we're talking about since it sounds like differences
between '78 and '81 make the comparison difficult.  On the van there are 2
bolts which insert through the trans and through the bell housing of the
engine, and 2 studs which are affixed to the trans and go through 2 other
holes in the bell housing.  The tinware is not involved at all.  (Although
getting nuts attached and tightened down on the top 2 bolts is a struggle;
if you can stand on you head and have fingers as thin as spatulas, it sure
helps!)
