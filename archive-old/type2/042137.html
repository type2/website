Subject: fuel pump (Alt. style) question

hi, I have a 71 westy that is going to trade her 38amp generator for a
nice 55 amp alternator.  I just picked up a new bocar fuel pump that is
the slanted type for use with the alternator.  The pump has two
openings--one for intake and one for output.  One is on top and one is
on the bottom.  Can anyone tell me which one is for intake and whic is
for output--top or bottom?   Also the box for the fuel pump says that
the pump can only be used with a 99.5 long driving push rod.  Does my
1600dp have this push rod?  There is a spacer looking thing on my
existing fuel pump.  Do i need this for my new fuel pump?   any
responses will be greatly appreciated.  thank you
