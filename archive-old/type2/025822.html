&gt; Ok.  Now to clear this up.  Now that I have it narrowed down to 2 engines
&gt; which one is better for my application.  This bus is going to be a bus that
&gt; goes around town a few times a week, on the highway very little, and the bus
&gt; is going to be looking very good.  Partially for show.  In other words it
&gt; won't be running that much.  If it goes any were it will probably be on the
&gt; highway and not the town so I guess it will be my trip car.  Now which
&gt; engine would be better for this instence.  The beettlemex engine or a type4
&gt; engine???  What are the specs on the engines.  I have some specs on the
&gt; beetlemex engine but not the type4 engine.  If anybody has any please send
&gt; them on over.  See ya.

The Type 4 engine, definitely. It's a bigger engine, hence doesn't need to
work as hard to push the Bus to the same speed as the Type 1 engine will.
And I think the Type 4 engine is prettier than the Type 1 engine...since
appearance is important for this car, pretty is good. Get the fan shroud
polished and the tin painted the same color as the body, and it will be very
impressive looking. Add to that the stronger bottom end...

Now bear in mind that Type 4 engines are more expensive than Type 1 engines,
but it's worth it.
