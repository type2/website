Subject: Brake Drum Hunt &amp; Solvang Show

Hi All...
Went to the Solvang, California show last Saturday, and enjoyed myself
immensly.  Mostly 1967 and earlier type 2's were there, but there were a
decent amount (about 30 or so) Bay Windows... the most outstanding of which
was a 1973 that was totally, and I mean totally restored.   It was bright
red, with a white roof, and had a custom interior with bar, fridge, sink,
marble top counters, and lavishly covered and cushioned seats.   Upon
meeting the owner, he informed me that he had this bus since new, in '73,
and used it daily for work, and play since then.   He decided to restore it
completely, and has spent upwards of almost $25,000 doing it.   The paint
job alone costs $5000.00.   This is one dedicated and finincially able
person.  It was just beautiful... to the point that it almost brought a
tear to my eyes...   Other notable cars were the original Herbie beetle
from the movie, which had a Porsche 911 engine, and although the paint is
starting to fade, it is obviously the original from the first movie...   A
1948 beetle in battle ship grey was just gorgeous in pristine condition....   

And the highlight of the show for me... was the vendor area, or swap meet,
if you will, where I located and purchased a beautiful 1979 clock for my
1979 bus.   The date of manufacture on the clock read 11/78 which happens
to be the same date of build on my bus... Talk about good karma.... Got
home, had my VW guru mechanic install the clock, and lo and behold.. it
works perfectly!  I am one happy dude... I also asked my mechanic to fix a
few other items, one of which was the hot start problem I was having after
long trips, and after reading the archives, realized that this was a common
problem... so common in fact, that my VW Guru mechanic had performed
several of the relay fixes, and performed it on my bus... now I can ride
for hours without having to worry about starting it up when hot.   My
mechanic says, that the rear drums are worn, and have about 20 to 30% life
left in them.. so I starting hunting around for some Brake Drums.. 

Several of the usual VW parts sources have Brazillian VW brake drums,
and/or Mexican VW Brake drums, and some have no name manufacturer brake
drums...so, as a goof, I decided to call on my local VW dealer, since I
know the guys in the service and parts department since I own a 1997
GTI-VR6... and lo and behold... the parts guy from VW tells me that the
Brake Drums are an obsolete part, but the original German made ones sold
for ... get this...  $220 each!!!   I told him he was nuts, that everyone
else was selling 'em for $60 to $90 each...  and he replied that it didn't
matter, 'since the part is obsolete anyway...    2 days later, this guy
calls me back, and tells me that he mentioned the brake drums to another
parts guy in a close by dealership, and this other guy has the original
german New Old Stock brake drum in stock, made in Germany.... He wants $80
each, and I tell him, to go ahead and order 'em.   I'm picking them up
tomorrow... I sure hope that they are the real thing...   Has anyone else
had any luck in located real German VW brake drums for a late model Bay
Window?  In any case... it never hurts to call the local VW dealer when
hunting for parts.. who knows?   This guy said these brake drums were
collecting dust on a shelf for over 20 years... you never know what you can
find unless you seek it...  Anyway.. have a great weekend.. and I'll report
back on the Brake Drum hunt results...
