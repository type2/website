Subject: Re: [T2] Gold leafing a bus. 

Gee Dan that must've been neat when you passed through
people's headlights at crossings at night! A gold
reflector the length of the bus. I have some
reflectorized logos of the type of the manufacturer of
my bus (!) on magnetic material that I stick on the
back - as well as my hybrid ovalized V&amp;W in
traditional style but stretched to Subaru proportions
with the subaru stars - all reflective red and white.

 My dad's bus, first one in north Georgia I'm fairly
 certain,
 got me into this, ahem, vortex of a love affair with
 busses.
 It was a 1963, with a &quot;Texas kit&quot; camper inside.
 
 In any case, it was red.  He had me paint the V in
 the front
 and the raised rim that leads from that all round
 the bus at
 chest height -- you know what I mean -- in metallic
 brass and
 while wet dust it with glass beads like they use on
 some kinds
 of road stripes, etc.  I did an OK job, if I do say
 so.  It 
 did eventually wear off, but it took some years.
