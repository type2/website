&gt; I can completely relate to your dilemma.  In my youth I used to take off
&gt; on long trips in my vans whatever condition they might be in.  I never

&gt; to fail. Easy to diagnose, easy to fix, easy to carry spares.

Amen to that.  If you can do your own work, and early van with carb and
points ignition will get you there.  The downside is that you had better
be able to do the work yourself because qualified VW mechanics are few and
far between, particularly where I drive.

There is some comfort in knowing that there isn't anything in my bus that
can't be fixed for $1500 or less, usually far less.  That $1500 figure
would be for a complete engine replacement on an early bay.

Modern vehicles are much more reliable, but most failures put you at the
mercy of the mechanic (unknown to you if you are on the road) who can read
the codes and replace the widget the computer tells him to replace.  For a
while there the car's computer would read out the codes to anyone with a
paper clip to short the terminals, but these days you need a $200-$1000+
device to get the same information.  Progress...

I wonder how many people will be able to keep a 30-year-old New Beetle on
the road the same way that we keep 30-year old aircooled VWs on the road

&quot;Modern&quot; cars have their problems too.  There are several problems
reported on the Honda newsgroup concerning various honda models burning
their valves around 70,000 miles.  Seems that Honda specifies a 110,000
mile valve adjustment interval and that's just too long to wait.  The bad
news is that 70K miles is well out of warranty and Honda just says &quot;so
sorry!&quot; when they hand the customer a $2500 bill for the repair.

I think I'll keep my bus.
