This piece is important, and you have to install it before the pulley goes
on!

There is also a piece of tin that goes across the pulley on the rear (FIF)
side to prevent debris from falling into the bottom pulley tin.  This
piece is commonly discarded.

&gt; the duct for the oil cooler,

Also important, and must be used in conjunction with a front tin with the
proper hole.  This is a '71-only bus part.  If you can't get the proper
part you can improvise by adding sheet metal to a doghouse bug front tin.

 and the fan itself (unless they
&gt; are interchangeable between doghouse and non-doghouse).

It will fit, but a wider fan is better.  Measure yours to see which one
you have.  With all the mixing-and-matching that has gone on over the
years it isn't unusual to find a doghouse fan in a non-doghouse shroud.

&gt; Also, is this right?

&gt; I have #18 and #'s 17 &amp; 19. Are 17 &amp; 19 supposed to be a two piece deal?

Yep, to get at the thermostat.  I've also seen them in one piece.
