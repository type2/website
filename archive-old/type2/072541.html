I recently purchased a 78 Transporter that was equipped with an overhead air conditioning unit.  The PO stated that the bus came from New Mexico before settling in Washington State and that the air conditioner was working but ran out of freon so it was not hooked up.  I am planning on removing the ac unit and components from the bus.  Ive read a bit about AC units in the library however, am seeking more information regarding all the parts/hoses, compressor, condensers etc that need to be removed.  A nice schematic diagram would be helpful.  Also, Im sure this AC equipment would be useful to someone living in arid climes and am wondering what it is worth?  The parts Ive inspected look great, (compressor, overhead unit, hoses etc.  Make me an offer if anyone is interested.  One last thing, is there some cooling tin that will need to be replaced once the compressor is removed from the Type IV engine?  Thanks

Chad
