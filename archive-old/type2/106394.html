&gt; &gt; if you go from a stock VW

&gt; &gt; difference is about 7.6% to slow or a speedometer difference of about
&gt; &gt; 4.5 miles faster at 60mph. so if your speedo say 60 you are doing 64.5
&gt; &gt; mph. but your engine is only working as hard as it did before to get to
&gt; &gt; 60 on the older rims and tires.

the speedo is on a front wheel and is unaffected by power curves etc, only
revolutions of the front wheel.

&gt; Well sorta. Dont forget wind resistance. 

the laws of physics still say it takes a certain amount of energy to move
a given object at a given speed.  can't change that unless you change the
object being moved... unless of course you have found the holy grail of
perpetual energy
