Subject: Re: [T2] sub-cultures

I have actually taken this culture a step farther. i carry a few extra parts 
in my bus, like hubcaps and wiper arms and that kind of thing. sometimes 
i'll park by a bus and add on pieces that are missing, just to make up for 
the karma of people who are stealing pieces. what a nice surprise to have a 
&quot;lost&quot; hubcap find it's way home...
keep it real,

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;When I bought my bus the first thing the PO taught me was that there was
&gt;indeed a &quot;proper waving etiquette&quot;.  He said that when you are driving down
&gt;the road and you see another bus (bay or splitty) you must stick your whole
&gt;arm as far out the window as possible and wave at him while honking the 
&gt;horn
&gt;(assuming it works lol).  If you happen to see a vanagon, you wait for him
&gt;to wave first, and if he does, then you return the gesture but not with
&gt;quite as much enthusiasm as you would for an earlier bus.  The same 
&gt;protocol
&gt;applies to the older bugs.  But he was very clear that you are to 
&gt;completely
&gt;ignore both the newer bugs and the Euro vans.  Well I thought that whole
&gt;concept was pretty clever but I agree with whoever said that it doesn't
&gt;matter what vehicle you drive.  Lets just say that as long as you are
&gt;driving an air-cooled vw.... I got your back!!
&gt;
&gt;Oh yah, something else he mentioned is that if you ever see another Type 2
&gt;parked someplace you should: 1) park next to it, 2) go into the store and
&gt;try to find the owner (which is usually obvious) 3) start a conversation by
&gt;asking one of two questions.... Question #1 what year is it?, and then
&gt;Question #2 what other busses do/have you owned besides/before this one?
&gt;
&gt;I think the best part of owning a bus is knowing that everybody helps
&gt;everybody, which is pretty encouraging when you consider the day and age
&gt;that we are living in. What goes around comes around...Keep it real :)
