Subject: Winter in a VW Bus

We got our first dusting of snow here on Long Island so I figured it was
time to post to the list the poem I wrote some years ago, as I do every
winter.  Enjoy.

Winter in a VW Bus



Not a month before Christmas
and all cross the land,
bus owners are driving
with ice scrapers in hand.

They're scraping without
and they're scraping within,
to see where they're going
and where they've just been.

With a little warm air
that passes for heat,
we lose feeling in our fingers
our ears and our feet

So we put on our hats 
our gloves and more sox,
endure the cold weather
in our German icebox.

Winter is long 
and it's cold and it's dark,
but these buses we drive 
have a place in our heart

Without a complaint
or hardly a care,
we wait for warm weather,
summer to bear.
