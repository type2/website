Subject: Re: Need Brake Booster

&gt;  this is an everyday driver.  Any advice?

I heard that you can just plug the vacuum line.  then when you get your
booster...stick it in and all will be well.  I think it was David Schwarze who
got his vacuum booster rebuilt.  Try to find a shop to rebuild it as I *think*
that would be cheaper.  Again, not sure here as I haven't had any problems with
the booster on my 71......yet

Hope this helps
