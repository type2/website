Is this combination considered a weak link as  well?



I like the idea of upgrading to the Rabbit diesel clutch.  What exactly makes
it a better choice?




hey Jon  The later style of TOB arm is much better than the early type  Still 
mthe weak point is where the TOB arms are welded to the crosshaft. A

disc will take a lot higher torque than the std disc. Think about  the torque 
a diesel puts out compared with a reg. gas engine.  Only thing  to watch out 
for is that the flywheel hasn't been surfaced too much to cause the  disc to 
hit the gland nut.  I have been using the diesel disc for quite  some time and 
have found they work very well  later  mark  d
