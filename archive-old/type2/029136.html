Subject: Trip to Vermont

Since this is such a LOVING list I wanted to let every one know Debbie and I
have arrived safely back home from our trip.

We stayed at a Ski Resort called Jay Peak, of course no snow yet but the
leaves had just started to change and Created a Carpet of Color!

Bus sightings were only two, a forgotten bay in a field that looked sad
-( and a Syncro Westy at the Burlington Air Port!

Thanks for being another family!

Some one mentioned German Shepards in a post, and since I love mine check
