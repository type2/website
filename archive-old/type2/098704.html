&gt;
&gt;Please cross-post this to any list you are on!  Forward to 
any 
&gt;interested parties!
&gt;
&gt;        We have a newly acquired 85 Westy in Philadelphia 
that needs to get to 
&gt;any West coast Matson Shipping port (Long Beach, Port 
Hueneme, San 
&gt;Francisco area, Seattle, and more...) for shipment to 
Hawaii.
&gt;
&gt;        Looking for someone interested in a free or cheap 
road trip- all 
&gt;aspects are negotiable.  Willing to provide one way plane 
ticket and 
&gt;fuel for trip is negotiable depending on how long you take, 
where you 
&gt;go, etc.  If you don't need a plane ticket, we can 
negotiate payment 
&gt;for driviing.
&gt;
&gt;        Anything is negotiable, will consider all offers.
&gt;
&gt;If someone could cross-post this to the Type 2 list, Syncro 
list, 
&gt;Beetle list, Extreme Vacation list, etc I would be grateful.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;        Thank you very much, and Aloha-
