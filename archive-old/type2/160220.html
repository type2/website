thats  another story cant figure out why the throw out bearing clips keep 
getting eat  up in there hanging up the trhwo out bearing on her beetle  68....??



hey Chai    They make some TOB clips called super clips.  These have a coil 
on the outside to create a spring action, This coil also  allows you to wire 
tie the clip to the crossshaft. Do so not too tightly and the  TOB has to pivot 
some.  later  mark Dearing
