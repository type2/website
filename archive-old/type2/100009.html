Subject: Re: [T2] FI conversion questions

Steve,

You asked:

&gt;Can I use a stock '74 exhaust with FI?

Though the exhaust system did change chronologically with FI, there's no reason you can't intermix them. you could use your 72-74 style setup, or you could buy a new system like yours from the busdepot with some stainless steel parts!

&gt;Oh, one other thing: should I get a new engine compartment wiring harnass for the FI setup? If so, does it matter what year it's from?

If you find someone making them, plese let us all know! Yes they are different, early 75 is unique, california/federal versions have different items. You'll need to be specific about your questions here.

Later,

Billy
