Subject: Re: [T2] Removing a head stud

Since they've put up the good fight I've smoked the peace pipe with them and
promised they can stay in their holes as long as the sun shines and the rain
falls, or until the next owner of these heads, whichever comes first.

&gt; &gt; Hi all:
&gt; &gt; Anybody have any other &quot;non-destructive&quot; tips on getting these
&gt; &gt; things out?
&gt;
&gt; tom,
&gt; i have to ask: why do you need to remove these studs?
&gt;
&gt; they are seldom rusty, broken or otherwise in need of repair. leave them
in
&gt; if you can.
