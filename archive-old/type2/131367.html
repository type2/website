Subject: Charging a battery in sitsu

Battery DEAD - 8 months old.  Probably some amperage drain caused this. 
(DEAD = reading LESS THAN 1 Volt!!).

Question:  What might be wrong/bad/danger of  attaching a 10 amp Battery 
Charger to the starting battery while the battery is still connected to the 
system.       That is, just putting the BC positive cable to the battery's 
positive post/cable(s) and the BC negative cable to the battery's negative 
ground post/cable??

Also, I have a newish 2 month old deep cycle battery on the driver side that 
reads over 12 volts.  For some reason, this is not helping to start the VW.  
Should the deep cycle battery kick in to take over from the passenger side 
battery??

Also, should I disconnect the fully charged deep cycle battery while I am 
charging the passenger side battery?? (Yes/No - vote now!!)

Thanks.
Barry sends
