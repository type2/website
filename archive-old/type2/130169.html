Subject: Generator

Well I spent all Sat afternoon on my generator.  And as Gary Martin stated in his reply to my request for assistance,  everything went as he stated.  I now have the generator sitting on my work bench reassembled and waiting to be placed back with the engine.  I am one who like many who don't know think we can figure out stuff on our own.  Well my problem all came down to shifting the shroud.  How to, and remembering how everything went back together.  I'm thankful for this forum and also the Green Bus Guide I bought a couple years ago.  I may have to get another because of all the torn pages and grease marks.   I'll let everyone know how it goes this afternoon as I attempt to reassemble and run the engine.
 
Thanks and Stay on the BUS....
