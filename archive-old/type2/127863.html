Subject: Re: [T2] Let me introduce myself... :-) (part II)

I've seen all the pictures now and I must say it's a
very interesting bus you have there!

Look at this:

http://www.wolsoft_dot_com/mykombi/images/VWKOMBI_MOTOR004.jpg

That's optional extra M240: Engine for low-octane fuel
Recognizable by the engine number that starts with a
'C', it is a 1600cc single port engine.

And this:

The oil filter is really big and long. This must be
the extra large oil filter for dusty region (M156 if I
am not mistaken).

And this rare item:

http://www.wolsoft_dot_com/mykombi/images/VWKOMBI_Interior02.jpg

It is a bus that has a 'walk-thru' meaning that there
is an opening in the division wall between passenger
compartment and cabin. The 'walk-thru' normally makes
it possible to walk from the cabin to the rear of the
bus....but this bus also has the two-seat passenger
seat (normally only available with full width wall).
And it looks original because of the plastic beam that
connects the two 'walls'.

If I am talking in mystery language let me know. I
might be a bit over enthousiastic. I just don't see
these modifications every day :-)



yours,


Vincent
