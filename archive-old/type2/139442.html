No damage to pistons or valves. Pistons are like new (and cylinders 
too); I haven't taken valves out of heads yet, but there is no visible 
damage on the valve faces. Clearly, it was impossible to correctly 
adjust the valves with this cam. The engine was very loud in its final 
weeks/months; I attributed this to another known problem (which I now 
think was perhaps not a problem at all).

I think this was caused when I rebuilt the engine and didn't correct 
the endplay until I had sheared bolts off the fan twice.
