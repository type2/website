Subject: [T2] Some days I just hate oxygen!

Yes, oxygen is a necessity of life, but it also causes rust, and Edelstein's
got a bunch of it. Mostly under where the closet was, though there's plenty
where the plywood floor was too.

This isn't just your ordinary rust, either. This is scaly, nasty, heavy duty
rust, the kind that turns a 20 gauge panel into a 25 gauge panel after you
get it all off.

The immense amount of sand in this Bus, coupled with the salt-air rust,
indicates that someone spent far too much time at the beach.

The rest of y'all with closets in your Buses, whether Rivieras or
Westfalias, may want to temporarily pull the closets out and POR-15 under
them.
