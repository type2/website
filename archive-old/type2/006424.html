I sure wouldn't bet my life on that.  CO is an exceedingly nasty substance,
and has a propensity for lingering in unexpected places.

In the marine field, the latest big issue with CO is the discovery that it
hangs around the stern of powerboats even long after the engine is shut
down.  There were several incidents where children swimming off the
stern/swim step of shut down powerboats became quickly very ill from CO
poisoning.  It took a long time to sort out the source of their poisoning
because the investigators assumed CO couldn't be the culprit with the engine
not running.

A couple of weeks ago on Puget Sound, in Western Washington, 3 men were
aboard a power cruiser running at speed and all 3 were affected by CO
poisoning.  Their cruiser had a top over the cockpit, but was open on the
sides and back.  By the time the 3rd guy realized he was losing
consciousness the other 2 were already collapsed and out.  All 3 were saved
by a hyperbaric chamber at a local hospital, but the 2 unconscious men were
nearly dead before being rescued.

CO is just too dangerous to take chances with or make assumptions about.
Thicker sleeping bags are much cheaper than funerals.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Speaking of CO, I recall seeing a photograph of a properly installed
&quot;stock&quot; location BN4, and the exhaust protruded into the air stream at the
rear of the drivers side drive wheel.  I think that even while sitting idle,
this would be enough to carry away the exhaust fumes(?)  &lt;&lt;
