&gt;Hi Dave,

&gt;Mechanical total advance is what you have under full load full throttle
&gt;conditions.

I don't see it that way.  Mechanical total advance is what you have when
the rpms are high enough to actuate the mechanical advance mechanism
completely.  It varies from distributor to distributor, but usually all
mechanical advance is in by 2500 rpm (earlier on the 009).  The mechanical
advance mechanism is entirely dependent upon engine RPM and not at all
dependent upon load or throttle position.

&gt;In this state, you will have 0 vacuum.

You will have carb vacuum, just not manifold vacuum.  Since carb vacuum is
what is hooked to the vacuum advance port, &quot;full throttle full load&quot;
contitions make use of both mechanical and vacuum advance.

&gt;If you also have a vacuum
&gt;advance connected, at full load and full throttle with 0 vacuum, only the
&gt;mechanical advance is in play.

Not true.  See above.

&gt;The vacuum advance adds in timing advance at
&gt;light load conditions resulting in increased fuel economy and a cleaner, more
&gt;complete burn.

It also adds timing at full throttle.  In fact, the more throttle, the more
advance is added, since the &quot;amount&quot; of vacuum is dependent on how much air
is flowing into the engine, which in turn is dependent upon how far the
throttle is opened.  Hook a vacuum gauge to the vacuum advance port and you
will see that it's true.

&gt;The grade and quality of the fuel you use impacts the total advance you can
&gt;run.

Agreed.

&gt;Adjust your distributor by making full throttle 3rd gear test runs
&gt;listening for ping.  Advance timing slightly, make test run.  continue to
&gt;advance until ping appears, then back off a few degrees to be under the ping
&gt;point of your engine.

I used to think that way too, but as you said, there are many variables,
and hence the problem.  One variable is the temperature of the engine.  If
you do the above procedure on a warm (not hot) engine, or on a hot engine
but on a cool day, then proceed to drive up a long grade on the highway on
a hot day, your engine will likely start to ping because of the effects of
heat soak.  If you only give yourself a &quot;few degrees&quot; worth of buffer, you
are endangering your engine unless you are very, very careful and
attentive.  One final note - on a very low compression engine, being just
shy of the &quot;ping point&quot; of your engine will probably be way too much
advance.  Back when I was running 6.8 to 1 compression, I could advance the
distributor practically forever and not hear any pinging.
