Stephen:

Is there a place in San Jose that SWEPCO can be bought by someone who isn't a pro mechanic?

Thanks,

&gt;happening, it was lubricant.  Southwest Petroleum Company (SWEPCO) was the
&gt;firm that created the gear lube that made that possible.  Not sold in any
&gt;retail outlet, but only through high repair facilities, it retails for about
&gt;+ACQ-4.95 a pint here in California.  I put it in my bus and have had zero
&gt;problems.  It was the unofficial oil for Ferrari in North America even when
&gt;Agip was the sponsor of Ferrari Formula 1.  It is the best gear lube I have
&gt;ever encountered in 34 years as a professional mechanic.  SWEPCO also makes
&gt;a great bearing grease, but I am still a believer in Mobil 1 for the crank
&gt;case.
