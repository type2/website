A surf shop in Cornwall (allegedly in England but it depends if you ask a
Cornish resident or not) has this amazing Split that has been cut lengthways in
half and hung in the shop as a sales gimmick / crowd puller / talking point.
Bit sad really but it sure gets attention
(......I also saw a lenghtways cut Split hanging on a friend's wall in sunny NM
come to think of it..)
