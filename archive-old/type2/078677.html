Subject: Re: [T2] # 1 EXHAUST VALVE SINKING BUMMER

Hi John Here
After your first pull you get better at it.  I believe 68-73 is the easiest.  
Pop off the 
rear bumper and pull out the rear plate. Then all you have to do is remove 
the rear engine support and the four bolts for the motor to the tranny and 
slide the motor out.
I know I left out the disconnects.  Just trying to make a point.  My first 
motor job on my 68 I told a friend (yea Mike four bolts pass the joint). It 
is really easy, if you have the time and the tools. If your really serious I 
can post the set of procedures 
that cover almost everything.                         JPB2001
