Subject: Valve adjustment problems

Hi,

I just boughy my first vw ('72 campervan, but it has a '74 engine in it)I 
was attempting to adjust my valves a few days ago and I have ran into a 
problem.... when I have #1 cylinder in postion, there is too much clearance, 
like were talken around .100 or possibly a bit more.  Obviously I have the 
adjusting screws as far in as they can go while still holding onto the 
locknut (meaning the majority of the screw is between the cylinder head and 
rocker arm).  I checked if there were any shims under the rocker stand that 
could be removed, but from what I can tell there aren't any.

There is currently no timing strip on the crank case (got one comming from 
the bus depot) but there is a paint mark on the crank case (at about 11 
o'clock which looks like the right spot), and there is a file mark touched 
in white paint on the font of the crank shaft pulley.  When you line the two 
marks up the distributor lines up also, so I am pretty sure that I got the 
tdc figured out.

So my question is this: is there anything else that might be cauing the 
excessive space besides having the wrong push rods ??? and is there a 
cheaper alternative?  Incase you are wondering, #2 cylindr has the same 
problem.

Any suggestions are much appreciated.
