Subject: Re: [T2] New fuel injectors?

I'm just Curious did you do a compression check? I had a similar problem with 
my 76 turned out I had two bad valves (3 and 1) Changed the cylinders, 
sleeves and heads. Runs good but runs a little ruff at idle. Valves are set 
correctly. The bus has about 160,000. Looking forward to what the list has to 
say about new injectors.
