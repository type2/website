Subject: Bonehead question
Mime-Version: 1.0

Fellow listee's,
 I know this is a 68+ list and the information I've gleened from all the
posts I get daily is key to the successful back to stock restoration of my
'68 Crewcab (Hienz). (BTW there seems to be no sources for replacement drop
gates for these(?)).  Anywho, my ignorance is generic.
My bonehead qustions are these:
#1- I recently came into ownership of a '67 walk-thru Westy. It was a great
deal! (like free) I just hauled it out of a neighbors yard (the sweet
little old lady signed a release for me). No engine. MX options -125,-128a
and -128b, (if you've been keeping track) full Westy tent under the
backseat (BINGO). How do you determine the condition of the transaxle? I've
never seen this bus running though it did roll quietly  when I towed it
home. There is no paperwork.  I've tried to research thru the archives but
gave up after a bit. ( I can only do this at work)
Bonehead question #2. The last tags on the bus go back to 1990. How do you
fellow &quot;rescueers&quot; establish a paper trail after this many years of
neglect?
Any advice (as always) will be greatly appriciated!
Mr. Moose (o:{
'68 Crewcab (Heinz)
'70 Ghia
'67 Westy
'64 &quot;Beatle&quot;
