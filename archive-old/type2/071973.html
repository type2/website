My engine leaks with equal enthusiasm whether I run synthetic or dino oil.
Therefore, I run synthetic because it is superior oil.  If you are going to
invest money in your bus, synthetic oil should be at the top of your list.
I just took a close look under the valve covers (engine is on the workbench
at the moment) and it is as clean there as the day I installed the heads,
3.5 yrs and 56,000 miles ago.  I'm sure the rest of the engine is just as
clean, thanks to synthetic oil.

As for gauges, I would get them in the following order:

Oil pressure - most important by a wide margin IMO
Cylinder Head Temperature
Oil temperature
Vacuum
Battery Voltage (preferably digital)
