Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Fan Shroud and flaps &amp; covers

Thanks Mike,

That sounds like an excellent idea. If I can't locate the stuff I need at 
the shop here maybe that is what I will do. The butyl is too plyable when 
hot and it smells like s%#_at_! Thanks for the extra option.

&gt;From: &quot;Gensler, Mike&quot; &lt;

&gt;For a cheap and easy solution that will last many years, get some of the
&gt;RUBBER weather stripping from Home Depot, cut to fit, clean the surface of
&gt;the covers very good, and stick in place.  NOTE: This is the RUBBER
&gt;stripping (with little grooves in it), NOT the grey foam-rubber stuff.
