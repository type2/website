Subject: [T2] Asbestos?

Hello Folks,
     Doing some touch ups on the chassis last night with POR 15 (while I've 
got things removed for the beam replacement access is easier) and I came 
across the junction box for the heat ducts, which was wrapped in a rubber 
jacket that was lined with a white woven material, is this sucker asbestos?
