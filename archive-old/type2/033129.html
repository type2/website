Subject: Cheap 69  no-engine &quot;starter&quot; camper FS in Western, NC

Want a challenge? Only bus within 15 miles of us here in the mountains was
headed to crushville city. Paid the PO $100 for it.

Don't need it (have 2 campers now). Don't want it (a total of 7 dubbs). You
can have for $150 ($50 &quot;profit&quot; for: supplying you beer when you come to get
it; dragging it here; and roughly cleaning off the mold---- it's been off
the road since 1980 !! ).

VIN: 238107283. Has ancient sticker of &quot;Bill KIrk VW, Garrison, MD&quot;. Speedo
reads 53333. Prolly only a 1 in front of that..as it was on road only 11
years..and body is unbeaten.

Good:

Title
Very straight body.
NO bondo that I can see..don't believe it's ever been hit.
All glass, including louvers, in place, with only a smidgen of fog around
windshield.
Has external power jack.
Appears to be a standard camper set in there..won't know til PO gets all the
baja parts out of the way..so I can see what I bought..
One side mirror in excellent shape, one good.
Stock Saphire XVIII radio (unknown condition).(top section of antenna broken
off)
Cancer not all that bad considering it's road-side-junkie-forever status.
Sliding door is smoother/tighter than on anything else we own..now why is
that?

Bad:

No engine (I have a T4 spare only).
Think there's no rear bumper..may be inside in the mess.
No front part to pop-top (I have a spare one..off a 70, no canvas, which
I'll donate if you have to come a long way..and whine a lot :).
Mold ALL over. Looks like it'll come off easily..I'll rough clean it.
Fairly large patches of rust in several places..heavy, but surface; looks
cosmetic, to my untrained eye.

Ugly:

Front cabin floor needs patching
Some wood ceiling pieces fallen off (got wet. PO brought it to his house 2
yrs ago..took me til this spring to convince him to at least put a tarp over
the hole!).
Rust under w/s needs attention

All-in-all a definite prospect if you know someone with some time and not
many bucks. If no one needs it, I'm still hesitant to part it out, so will
probably put it in bottom of project pile..and put my T4 spare and poptop
spare on, in, let's see. 2002. Really.

P-mail for specific items you'd like checked. I'm bringing it home tomorrow
or Sunday and can get a better idea.

Regards, Marv Krupp
