Subject: RE: AGH!  my engine starts and then immediatly stops!

&gt;the engine will start, rev for about one second, then
&gt;immediately stop.  no matter how many time i turn the key, 
&gt;same thing every time.  if i put my put on the gas pedal 
&gt;and then start it, it revs high, but the moment i take my 
&gt;foot off the gas pedal, it stops.  i have a 77, 2.0 liter, 
&gt;fuel injected.

Are you using a Pertronix in place of your points?  That describes exactly what 
my 73 was doing.  Bad Pertronix.
