&gt; The proper of timing for your Volkswagen depends on the distributor you

&gt; crankcase!!!!

ALSO automatics are tuned at a DIFFERENT RPM than Sticks

&gt; 
&gt; TYPE 4 DISTRIBUTORS: 
&gt; The following applies to all distributors that came stock on the type 4
&gt; series engines (021 905 205 series distributors):
&gt; 
&gt; Vacuum Advance Distributors (one hose) are timed to 7.5 BTDC at 800-950
&gt; RPM, with the vacuum hose on.

900-1,000 If I remember correctly
