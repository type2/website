Subject: Counterweighted cranks

Hello Listers.

    I'm getting ready for a rebuild of my 78 Champagne.  It has 86k on the
original engine.  My question for the masses is &quot;Where can I find a
counterweighted crank for my bus&quot;?  I would appreciate any guidance in this
search.  Also, is there a tremendous difference in German vs. Brazilian
p&amp;c's as far as reliablity, performance, and general karma?  I know the
price is right on the Brazil set, but seeing the cost of German makes me
wonder.

hmmm...
Isaiah
