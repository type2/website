Subject: Cleaning Westy Pop top

The thread about stinky seats got me thinking about my near death 
experience cleaning to top on the 72 westy. I mixed 1 part bleach to 
one part water and put in a spray bottle. The top was literally 
blackened with mildew. I misted the top with the solution and let it 
sit for a few minutes. Step two was to rub it down with rags and a 
brush. Step three was to hose it off. There was not much improvement 
so I repeated the process about 8 times over the period of two hours 
and when it was all said and done the top was a glistening white. I 
was really surprised the the gelcoat did not show any real signs of 
crazing or cracking.

The only issue left it to deal with a few rust stains from the canoe 
rack that the PPO installed. She should have used stainless steel 
bolts. When I figure out how to get the rust stains of the gelcoat I 
will swap the bolts and rebed them using 3M 5200.

A little elbow grease and some serious nausea was all it took. Good 
luck with your pop top

Chris
