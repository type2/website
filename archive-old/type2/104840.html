            Vehicle Description

           1948 airstream motorhome,weewind trailer pre bubble,professionally
built in 1959 on a 1959 volkswagon volkswagen kombi bus,1500cc volks
engine,sheetmetal work done by professional aircraft specialist, &gt;&gt;

I e-mailed this to a friend who's got a VW and is also a cop. His comment,
after expressing his admiration for the workmanship, was that the Wee
Wind wouldn't get five miles without being stopped (especially on an inter-
state). Reason: Looks 'too' much like an Airstream that has lost its tow
vehicle and every cop who sees it is gonna stop it to check the paper
work to see if it's legal...
