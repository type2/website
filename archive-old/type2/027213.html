If you call and they have what you need but you want it looked at give me a
shout here and I will try and run over and look at it... be aware I am no expert
mechanic! They have a number of westy parts like sinks and stoves and cabinets...
give em a call... they also sell whole cars as shown above.... they like to sell splitties complete if
they can.... Tell em I can come over and look at it for you if you want... they will probably say &quot;Who?&quot;
but they have lotsa folks comen in all the time so dont panic. they deal in VW and Audi stuff... they have
tin all over the place... geez what a fun place to wander around in!
