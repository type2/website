Subject: RE: [T2] Sliding door handle color?

&gt; Looking for a confirmation on the color of the rear door pull 
&gt; handle (#211 843 642a) on the slider for a '78 Westy. Was
&gt; there a difference in color on these handles? Mine seems 
&gt; to be gray and most I've seen for sale online are beige. The one on 
&gt; OEVeedub looks to be the gray color I'm needing but its kind 
&gt; of hard to tell. http://tinyurl_dot_com/2xtst Has mine just faded 
&gt; to gray over the years?


Actually, most everyone is selling the same handle (genuine VW/Brazil),
and &quot;in person&quot; it's more gray than beige. OEVeedub's picture is fairly
accurate color-wise (certainly more accurate than my photo - I've got to
fix that tint!), although my price is a bit lower.
