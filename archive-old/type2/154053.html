Subject: Re: [VB] strange offer - thoughts?

&gt; so this kid does. '$1200? i need a car bad; i had to lose the navigator, 
&gt; it was costing me $900/month.' hm. give me the night to think about it. 
&gt; he gives me his number, and goes off
&gt;
If he can afford $900/month, he can afford $1200.

I'd take the rack off right now before it disappears tonight to &quot;reduce the 
price&quot;.
