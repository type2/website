Subject: [T2] Gas Stove on 79 ASI

Hi all,

I am currently restoring my ASI, and I was wondering if anyone could point
me to some documents/resources as to how I can go about overhauling my
propane stove/tank/fittings/etc.. without blowing my hand off.

Any help or recommendations would be great.

Thanks.
