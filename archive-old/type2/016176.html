Your message implies that you have no shims in place now.  If not, then
there should be no problem with the shims which are available in a multitude
of thicknesses.  You should avoid having several shims and rely instead on
one or two to get it correct.  Shims aren't a band aid they are the way it's
done to reasonably adjust end play.  Check Wilsons rebuild book.  I think he
discussed shims in it.  Good luck.   

 Well I checked the end play and the dial 
indicator tells me that I have between .007&quot; and .008&quot; of play.  Bentley 
says that it should be within 003&quot; and .005&quot; with a wear limit of 
.006&quot;.  What should I do?  Should I tear the beast back down again and 
get the shortblock rebuilt or should I just shim it?  If I were to shim 
it how long may I expect it to last?  I realize its just a band aid, but 
I want to drive my bus, but yet I don't want the thought of that looming 
over my head, unless it really isn't that bad.  The engine ran wonderful 
before I took it out, but I got that washer in the #1 cyl some how when 
I was replacing PR tube seals just after I got back from BNNTA last fall 
and I thought I would just &quot;freshen&quot; it up.
