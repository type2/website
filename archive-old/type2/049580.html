Hello List     When I  first went to college  at Va. Tech   i couldn't find 
any place to live and stayed in my 66 westy for 3 months .  Wasn't bad at all 
, showers all over the place , ate downtown B'burg , sleeped in the bus 
behind the caspus greenhouses.  Try this test, take both cars to the school 
at diffrent times and see which gets more attention .    I still have and 
drive that same westy and remember all the fun times in it during spring 
breaks ( Key West  ,what fun)       Mark Dearing       Salem Import Service
