I agree with bob. You have a dropped seat, so there are problems with the
engine configuration - it might be badly out of tune, lean running on that
cylinder, whatever it is, THAT is what needs to be fixed, the dropped seat
is merely a symptom. If you bolt on another head, it will not fix the
problem, only the symptom. Depending on the mileage of the bad engine, and
time constraints, perhaps it is time to consider a full rebuild, and the
spare engine might get you by till that is done.

If you decide to replace only the head, we have rebuilt heads in stock. We
use what I believe is the best cylinder head rebuilder in the , he does ONLY
cylinder heads, mostly air-cooled porsche and his work is immaculate. Our
rebuilt heads are $CAD 400.00 each outright. We also buy cores that are
rebuild-able.

You cannot replace cylinder heads with the engine in the bus without causing
yourself extra work. Engine pull is the only way to fix this.
