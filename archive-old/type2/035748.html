help! PU! my exhaust smells like gas. a lot. it definetly is not a gas
leak, just replaced and clamped hoses and have watched them while
goosing throttle. start bus and stand back a few feet and there it is
gas smell. this has cropped up in the last few days and seems to be
getting worse. where should i be looking? any responses will be greatly
appreciated. 71 with 1600 dp engine, 34 pict 3 crb, 009 dizzy. last
tankful was 20 mpg
