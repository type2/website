You still need the compression test.

But actually this sounds like an intermittent electrical problem more than
anything else. I have had symptoms like this when I had a loose connection
at the coil (not so much the big wire coming out the end of the coil, the
little wire that feed the coil). There are at least three of them, check
all their crimp-on connections most carefully and clean the male spades
with steel wool. If you even suspect that any of the wires are broken
inside, replace them.

Also this sounds a lot like intermittent trouble with the fuel cut-off
solenoid, which is that wire that attaches to the left side of the carb
(FIF). That thing must be getting 12V when the bus is on and it must make
good contact with its spade or the bus will die immediately and won't
restart.

Could somebody in Seattle go over and help Kate? We have a LOT of hotshot
mechanics up there.
