Subject: [T2] Maximum Fuel Economy

Hi List,

I recently responded to a request for achieving maximum fuel economy.  I
approached it from the view of engine damage only.  Sorry.

With the engine tuned to the balance between fuel economy and engine cooling,
there are many ways to maximize the fuel economy.

1.  Tire pressure at 30 PSI front and 40 PSI rear is normal.  If I am on a trip
and want maximum economy, I run 55 PSI all around (max rating on my load range C
tires).  This decreases rolling resistance.  You can test this by pushing the
bus at the lower and higher pressures, and feeling the difference.

2.  Make sure none of your brakes are dragging.

3.  Repack your front and rear wheel bearings every 60,000 miles.  Immediately
if driven in water above the axles and hubs.

4.  Repack the CV joints every 60,000 miles.

5.  Use a synthetic transaxle oil for less drag.

6.  Make sure your alignment is correct.  A good shop will ask where you usually
drive and can adjust for twisty mountain roads, or, freeway flying.  The freeway
settings will conserve fuel while the mountain settings will give better
handling in the twisties.

7.  Remove any excess weight not needed for the trip.

8.  The spare tire out in front should do interesting things to the airflow at
the front of the bus, I believe it would cause some drag.

9.  Run smaller mirrors.

10.  Enclose the under carriage with sheet metal panels to reduce drag.

11.  Lower the bus.

and as much detail as you want to go to.
