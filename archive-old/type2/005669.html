Last month, I towed my 78 Westy from Dallas to Augusta, GA with absolutely
no problems.
I believe that this was the case because I took the time to ensure the
following:

1 - Transmission oil cooler installed (absolute necessity!)
2 - Class 1 hitch
3 - Tow bar PROPERLY installed on bus.
4 - Good tires on both vehicles.

It might be interesting to note that I towed her with a 93 Cherokee Country
(6 cylinder).  If she can do it, I would imagine that a motor home would
have no problem.  Incidentally, I did 70 (cruise control) the whole way.  In
fact, not even any swaying!

Oh - and by the way, she was well-loaded with wedding gifts.

Thanks all

Justin Smith
78 Westy
