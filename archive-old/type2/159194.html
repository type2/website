Subject: Re: [T2] Loaf of Bread

I had a '73 Italian Super Beetle (with a 1200cc 40 HP engine) and it 
handled well and rode fine. I would get some shimmying SOMETIMES 
(rarely). Also had a stock '65 with Kingpins and swing-axle. Hard 
suspension and worn kingpins would cause it to wander. '73 standard 
Beetle (balljoints up front and swing-axles out back (Italian spec). Did 
some funky axle tuck tricks on two occasions. Scary. Fine on straight, 
smooth roads. The IRS is way better in my opinion. Currently have a 
balljoints front and IRS rear ('69 chassis) under my Beetle and think it 
is a great middle ground between the original chassis and the the Super. 
I have heard the Super suspension can really be tuned (i.e. like a 914 
or 924) with excellent brake and wheel upgrades.

In every case the Beetles never let me forget that they were tail-heavy 
and eager to spin if pushed too far. All the front ends handled about 
the same. The IRS seemed to be least eager to slide out. They ALL needed 
more sway-bars and maybe front and rear as well. You lose that awesome 
ability to run hard down cobblestone streets fast with out  jarring your 
passenger's teeth out but at least it doesn't  lean like a sailboat in a 
hard wind and you gain traction that way...)

I have driven them in every weather condition as well. Good but the 
front slides first most of the time (stopping, turning). Will fish-tail 
suddenly if the rear is spinning the tires (ask me how I know).  Upgrade 
the brakes if you brake hard repeatedly or ride the brakes in the 
mountains. I lost my brakes to fade several times in all of my Beetles 
due to repeated 100 kph to 0 stops in heavy Italian traffic. About 3 
good stops and you were ready for a hair raising 4th stop. I now sport 
Ghia discs up front, 914 discs out back. Never faded even when towing a 
Hyundai back from VA. Also dry quicker in heavy rains (all the typical 
disc brake advantages).

Overall I'd choose the Super Beetle (curved windshield version) for 
refinement. Nice trunk, nice dash. Rest of the car is about equal.

Want refinement - aim for 914 features in your Beetle.
