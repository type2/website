Subject: Re: [T2] aa performance

I'd probably put more stock in Taiwanese parts than Brazillian.   But who knows.  I've got a while to think about what to buy for my  spare 2.0.  If I rebuild it with German/top-shelf parts, it'll  cost more than buying a rebuilt motor with a warranty.  So I'll be  looking to save when I think I can get decent parts.  Thanks...KR

&gt; I believe they are Cheng Shin pistons from China.

If it's the same Cheng Shin company that makes tires, they are in Taiwan,
not mainland China.  Getting beyond what constitutes &quot;China&quot;, I have
somewhat more confidence in Taiwanese quality control than that of
mainland China.
