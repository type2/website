When you pull the case apart, look at the back side of the bearings.  If 
they are other than standard bearings they should be so marked, 
indicating undersize for crank turnings and oversize for align boring.  
However, that only tells you what was there and doesn't tell you if 
everything is still within the new spec.  Either take the case to a shop 
to have it measured or invest in an inside micrometer to take the 
measurements yourself.
