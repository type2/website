&gt; PO put a Ford solenoid on, could that be it?
my van had a ford solenoid in it...

one fine day it stopped starting and i couldnt figure out why... so i
removed the ford solenoid from the circuit and it started fine.

My symptoms, however, were that it did nto click or do anything, so
perhaps your problem isnt the solenoid...

Why not just take a screwdriver and do the jumpstart that way (big
terminal to spade terminal from the ign switch)  that will rule out the
wiring in a jiffy.

peas,
