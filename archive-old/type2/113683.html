Subject: Re: [T2] Slip Streaming a Semi on I-95

Suit yourselves but as a motorcycle rider I have a HUGE appreciation for 
the debris that flies when a tire comes apart. I'm talking sidewall debris 
or worse, the tread.

In Chattanooga a few years back they had a semi roll over and fall on a 
compact car. Was even more compact when it was all over - as were it's 
occupants.

80,000 lbs. vs. 4,000 pounds. Who wins? &lt;grin&gt;

I'm not preaching of course though as your actions do not affect me in any 
way. Just don't tie up traffic too much while I'm on vacation! &lt;grin&gt;

On a trip south from Norfolk to Chattanooga back in '95 I was running about 
75 mph next to a semi in my CR-X. Noticed his lugnuts were about eye-level 
for me. Then I noticed him swerve towards me!!! Seems a tree had fallen 
across his lane. He saw it before I did and he needed to move over, which 
he did. We were travelling through an area that had weathered some big wind 
and heavy rain earlier. Of course I didn't know that b/c I was listening to 
cassettes instead of the radio which might have warned me...

Beware of heavy metal...

I too have done this. Interesting effects.
