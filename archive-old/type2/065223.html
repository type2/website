Subject: New member of family..('78 aux. batt)

It is with a heavy heart that I say farewell to Klaus, my '79 Westy.
I am trading him for a '78 Westy with a better body, rebuilt engine, auto
tranny.  Now comes the task of wiring it for an aux. batt. setup.  I 
already have some info on that from some type2-listers.  But I need 
detailed info, like everything that I have to buy and how to get 12v 
power into 110 for an outlet.  I hope to set it up something like this:
All the electrics that are to be run from the aux. grp.24 DEEP CYCLE 
batt.  will first be wired to a fuse/rocker switch(each appliance with 
its own fuse and rocker switch), then run the central wire from the 
fuse/switch panel to the batt.  Battery will be connected to isolator and 
isolator to alternator.  Is that right so far?  If any one could give me 
any help with this please let me know.  

Electrically  Impaired,

Ernie
