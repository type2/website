Subject: Fw: [T2]Wire retainer under rocker arms

Rae wrote-
&gt;Question for you all. That wire retainer or spring under valve cover,
&gt;should it be touching the push rods? If so, this brings up another
&gt;question. Do they wear out often and should I keep an eye on it?

those retainers put pressure on the tubes to place them.
other than that, not much to watch for except new oil leaks 8^).

&gt;I just replaced a pair of push rod tube seals and want to be darn sure I
&gt;put everything back in the right place.

that's always a good idea. are the slots in the rocker shaft hardware
pointing down to receive those retainers ?
