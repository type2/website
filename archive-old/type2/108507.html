Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor check....

Meg:
You may not need to pull out anything for now. If your distributor does not
have the vacuum unit, then you already know that you don't have the right
one. The vacuum unit is silver, is about the size of a small computer mouse,
has one or two ports for vacuum lines (hopefully connected to vacuum hoses),
and is attached to the distributor body below the distributor cap. Is it
there?

&gt; Okay how do I tell which distributor I have, maybe it isn't a 009. This

&gt; you will have to pull the dizzy out to see what the numbers are on the
side of it...
&gt; but remember if you pull the dizzy out you will have to set the timing
again possibly...
&gt; once you get the numbers post them someone here can then tell you what
dizzy you have...

&gt; Actually, if you remove the 1 nut that holds the distributor hold down
&gt; and lift it up with the clamp, you will not have to reset the timing
