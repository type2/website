Subject: Re: [T2] Severe Flooding Solved (long)

What kind of rotary fuel pump are you using?  How many
PSI is it?  I was looking at putting on a rotary
Carter 4070 which is 4 psi.  I was concerned that was
too much.  I'm fed up with pulsers.  Cheers....KR

&gt; I posted a problem a month or 2 back that I was
&gt; having with my '71 with a
&gt; stock 34PICT carb setup with rotary electric fuel
&gt; pump. It was severely
&gt; flooding a few hours after the engine was shut off.
&gt; It would take over a
&gt; minute of cranking to clear the excess fuel. A few
&gt; times it even failed to
&gt; turn over do to hydrostatic lock from excess fuel in
&gt; one of the cylinders. I
&gt; have resolved the problem and a few people asked me
&gt; to post what I found.
&gt; Sorry it's a bit lengthy.
