Subject: [T2] MORE Mindless vandalism...

The parking spot I have is just fine, thank you.  It's at the curb in front
of our home, under a large streetlight, on a &quot;quiet&quot; residential side
street, and has been occupied by our family vehicles for over 33 years.

What _is_ needed is a semblance of personal responsibility and/or decent
citizenship on the part of certain affluent college students with too much
spare time and insufficient academic challenge.

After a new rash of accidents and pedestrian near-misses the authorities
instituted emphasis patrols in the neighborhood and busted a bunch of yahoos
for speeding.  The &quot;official&quot; assumption is that this latest unpleasantness
is a payback action by some of the persons detained.  One driver was cited
for 54MPH in a 25MPH residential zone.  He angrily protested that his
Porsche Targa's speedo. showed he was only going 36MPH and thus he should
not have been stopped for speeding.

Anyway, the nefarious person or persons returned Saturday night.  More glass
was broken out of the left side jalousie window, and the entire left side of
the Campmobile was &quot;egged&quot; with considerable damage to the paint.  Another
Westfalia a couple of doors down the block was also egged.

I've patched up the window with racer tape pending cessation of hostilities.
I have no desire to provide a series of fresh targets, as my supply of
replacement windows is limited.

&gt;&gt;  Sounds like you need a new parking spot, a little farther away from the
firing range.  &lt;&lt;
