Subject: Running my computer off an auxiliary battery

        I just installed an auxiliary battery isolated from the main
battery in my '71 Westy.  I have also connected a DC to AC power inverter
to the auxiliary battery. The inverter is capable of putting out 400 watts
continuously. That is at least twice the power I need to run my computer
and monitor. 
        My question is: Is it safe (for my computer) to run my computer
while the engine is running? If so, is it safe to start or stop the engine
while running my computer?
        Thanks in advance.
