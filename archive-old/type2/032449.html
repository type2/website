Howdy all!  Happy Good Friday, Passover, and all those other religious things which I don't celebrate (no offense to religion, just stating that I'm a &quot;heathen&quot;.)  Anyway, I got this new 73 Westy last night and I want to adjust the idle.  I have never had a bus with dual carbs, they have all been single carb or F.I., so How do I accomplish this task on my dual carb Westy?  Is there an idle adjust screw on each carb?  Please advise.



Peace, John Baker
