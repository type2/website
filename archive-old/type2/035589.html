Ok here's my .02 cents worth i agree with Jeff (fonman),you guys can buy the 
900.00 beaters and such ,,then pay me my labor rate /hr plus parts to fix all 
the rusted out sheet metal ,,or as jeff did learn to weld and doi it your 
self or  you can go ahead and buy the one your looking at if it is that 
complete i don't see much of a problem,,you can tie up big bucks in finding 
all the stuff to get it back to the orginal purchase condition ,,,,as far as 
a warrenty for a year ,,come on that works on new cars and dealer used stuff 
but you'll pay twice the 5800.00 for the thing to start with ,,i no of no one 
who would  do that ,,i'm sorry if i'm selling it and you want it ,,money 
talks and bullchit walks ,,the banks and i have a agreement ,i don't loan 
money or finance stuff and they don't restore buses,,GRIN ,,as for the heater 
boxes ,,they are flat on the type 4 engines ,,as for the brakes ,,dang  for 
200.00 you can refurbish they complete system almost ,,sounds to me like they 
just need cleaning up ,,my 92 truck  brakes make a noise after sitting a week 
or so ,,,,i have did the metal work on several bay and splits lately that the 
labor alone has surpassed the purchase price of that one ,,my point is if you 
like it have a mechanic you trust ck it out for you ,,,ok done ranting now 
,,back into lurk mode ,,
