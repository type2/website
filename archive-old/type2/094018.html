Subject: Re: [T2] Throttle Cable

David,
Piece of cake.  Mine broke Wednesday afternoon, 
luckily in the driveway, and I installed the new one 
Thursday morning before work.  I did a looksy of where 
it was run, then pulled out the old, pushed in the 
new.  There was still grease in the tube from the last 
cable, so I didn't add more.  It's easier than a 
clutch cable, that's for sure.

Not sure about how the cable is held on, since my 
original cable had a cutout section to 'hook' into the 
pedal bracket thingy.  I used a bolt, two flat 
washers, and two nuts w/ purple Loctite to hold my new 
one on.  Works fine, until I find out what the 
fastener is supposed to be.  I suspect it's the same 
type of clip as the clutch cable.

Good Luck!

Subject: [T2] Throttle Cable

&gt;Just a quick question--My throttle cable broke at the 
carb end the other
&gt;day. I have a new one coming from John at 
aircooled_dot_net, I hope in time to
&gt;install this weekend. Here's the question: are there 
any tricks or
&gt;particular pitfalls to installing a throttle cable? 
I'm just looking to find
&gt;out what I'm in for. BTW- 74 bus, 1.8 ltr, center 
mount Weber progressive.
&gt;
&gt;As always, Facts, experienced comments, and two-bit 
opinions cheerfully
&gt;accepted!
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Dave
