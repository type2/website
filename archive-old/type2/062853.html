&gt; Any one with a split ever actually remove 211.711.341A from a
&gt; bus?  That's &quot;Pin-Hand brake lever from Chassis No. 20-041.712&quot;
&gt; for those who don't have the part numbers memorized.
&gt; 
&gt; With all the items I've removed and replaced on my '67 Deluxe,
&gt; I've never been able to budge mine.  The hand-brake lever is
&gt; nearly impossible to move and I'm looking to pull the mechanism
&gt; apart so it can be properly cleaned and lubricated.  Those of you
&gt; in NEATO already know I can be rather &quot;anal&quot; about these things
&gt; and it just bugs me that I can't remove the pin.
&gt; 
&gt; If you know the piece, you know the problem (aside from the rust
&gt; issue) is that there's no easy way to leverage it.  I have soaked
&gt; (literally, with a can-full stuck up there for a week) the thing
&gt; in Liquid Wrench.  I have applied heat, a la propane torch.  When
&gt; I had the steering gear out I even tried a clamp between the left
&gt; frame member and the pin.  I have mangled one end of the pin with
&gt; vice grips attempting to turn it (even used a clamp to close the
&gt; vice grips for a TIGHT fit), but the metal is so soft it just
&gt; chews it up.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm ready to drill it out (if I can get a drill up there) and put
&gt; one in from a parts bus--if I can get one out of the hulk out
&gt; without ruining it.  Anyone with experience with this one?
&gt;

Stupid queston. Is it pressed on? If it is, hammering, twisting with vise grips
won't do it. You would need a drift.

Another stupid queston. How do you get stripped hinge screws out for the front doors
on a split? They are torqued-in, so easy-outs won't do it.
