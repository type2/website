I used to have a VW bus, now I have a Cushman meter maid buggy, it's a very 
similar engine to the VWs, it's an air-cooled 700cc horizonally opposed 
twin, so it's like a VW engine cut in half.  Anyway, the seat is right above 
the engine, and the engine cover is made of thin sheetmetal, hence it's 
quite a noisy ride.  Does anyone know of any good materials to use as 
soundproofing?

I've seen a bulletin-boardy material used before, any idea where to get it 
and how to apply it? Any other tips?

I'd love to coat the entire engine compartment.

Also, does anyone know if such a system would impair the engine cooling, 
assuming I leave the existing vents open?

Thanks for any help.

If possible, please CC wrybread_at_wrybread_dot_com
