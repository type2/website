Subject: RE: 009 dizzy on a 2.0 motor

&gt; is there any way I can tell if there is a retard built in the
&gt; 009 I have?

If you have a strobe-timing light you can check it.  First Make sure you
have a paint mark on the pulley at #3 TDC (180 degrees from #1).  Then
check your timing at 3000 rpm with your timing light attached to the #1
plug wire and using the #1 mark.  Make a note of your total advance.
Now hook the timing light to the #3 wire and check your timing there.
If it is the same, no retard.  If it's less advanced then your #3 is
being retarded.
