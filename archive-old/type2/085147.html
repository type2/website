&lt;&lt; OR: you could leave both of your current vehciles 
intact, sell them and go to mexico in search of a used 
diesel bus. More expensive, but a bit simpler.

Would a Mexican or Brazilian bus have the proper/correct
DOT and EPA equipment and stickers to allow it to be reg-
istered in the USA? Lots of &quot;grey market&quot; cars have dif-
iculties getting across the border - Read the customs web
pages carefully before even attempting this. My only ex-
prience with &quot;importing&quot; a car was from Canada and luck-
ily the car was old enough (1962) that it needed nothing
in the way of certification. The guy in front of me at the
desk, however, was clearly being told that the vehicle he
had on a trailer was not going to cross without the cor-
rect paperwork...YMMV, but do a lot of homework before
spending your money on a VW that might not come home 
with you.
