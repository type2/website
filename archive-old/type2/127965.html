&gt; Sympoms: the bus runs good at high speeds and at

&gt; slowing for a turn or before I even get to a

&gt; the light turns drop it
&gt; in drive...too much or too little gas and it dies,
&gt; the weber carb making a
&gt; &quot;sploot&quot;  noise. The bus will start immediatly after
&gt; dieing and will generally
&gt; go if I feather the gas pedal.

  Maybe you're running too rich. Also, how much 
pressure does your pump put out. Over 3lbs will 
kill that crappy weber.
