Subject: Quest for caliper right side 1971

Hi,
I thought I'd share my progress ...
I witnessed two more calipers today, with the help of Bob from VW tech in 
Encinitas. I ordered at 8 am and he kindly drove down to bring me the first 
one over lunch, unfortunately it was a core with a single bleeder screw 
located in the bottom of the caliper. Pistons cutouts were right.

The second one has a nice core with double bleeder screws. Unfortunately the 
pistons cutouts point to the top of the caliper, which per Bentley (section 
8 The warning above Fig 7-15) is not correct.

Bob and I will keep looking. If we do not find a closer match I'll have the 
pistons turned half a turn in the caliper with 2 bleeder screws.

- Arnaud
