&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; Just a little question about my 1970 type 2.  Under the drivers seat is a 
&gt; black round knob that has a cable on it, what does this go to?

IT'S THE EJECTION SEAT!!  DON'T TOUCH IT!!!!

Seriously, it's the control for the heat outlet for the middle seat.  Pull
the knob out when the heat is on and part of the heat that would normally
go to the front comes out of the vent in the floor at the rear edge of the
walk-through area.
