&gt; Ebay has a perfectly good search engine for those who want to look up VW

&gt; However, I presume it's ok to first mention what a listmember has for
&gt; sale before putting it on ebay, but a grey zone I'd like to see
&gt; clarified is when a listmember HAS something on ebay is it OK to
&gt; advertize it?


OK:

I've got two rare OEM splitwindow FI piston return springs.  $25 each.  If
nobody buys them they go on ebay next week.

Giving the list first shot _before_ the auction is fine.  Inviting the
list to join the auction feeding frenzy is not.
