Subject: Re: [T2] Bolt for CV Joints

[...]
[...]
[...]

It is called a triple-square socket. 12 points. 3 x 4 corners.
Just about any auto parts store that sells K&amp;D tools has them. If I remember
right, it is a 8. Try a NAPA store.

&gt; I was just about to buy a torx tool for the CV joint bolts (mine aren't
&gt; allen heads), but then I noticed that there are more splines on the
&gt; bolts than on a torx bit.  Does anyone know kind of tool is used for
&gt; these bolts and where can I get one?  They don't seem to have them at
&gt; sears.
