Subject: Dash Speaker question

I am 80% done with restoring my dash. I got all new paint / dye and I 
changed the colors from brown to black and dark grey (a two tone job).

I recommend it even if you are staying with the same color - mine was brown 
with black areas where the OEM dye had turned color....

However, I am wanting to add a speaker to the OEM location for my CB (my 
first permanent installation after years of keeping them on plug in cables 
so I could move it from car to car).

How did the VW factory attach these speakers to the bottom of the dash top? 
I see no mounting tabs, or brackets.



Ciao!
