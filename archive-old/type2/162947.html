Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone using a Battery Minder

Greg has

&gt;  had thoughts of investing in a Battery Minder.
&gt;
&gt;One of the questions I have when using such a Battery
&gt;Charger/conditioner is can you simply hook up while the battery is still
&gt;in the bus and connected to the electrical system?

	A friend of mine managed a factory making such batteries.  He 
insists they do have to cycle, i.e   it's not just a matter of 
keeping them as fully charged as they will take at successive times; 
you should run them down pretty far, and then re-charge.
	Some 'battery minders' do this.  It always strikes me as a 
waste; better to run some 12V device by the battery and so get some 
use out of the discharge phase of the cycle.
