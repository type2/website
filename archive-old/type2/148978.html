&gt;that now - just no-one sees em till 60k when they do a rebuild.'

That was the word on the street a few month ago. I was reading about the issue over at STF and Raby even went as far as to start a lifter fund to finance the search for a working lifter because he ran out of his own money.

He claims the problem has been solved but details are few so I assume that means you need to buy lifters directly from him at his store. When you go there you have two options. a) buy a new camshaft and matching lifters b) be a guinea pig:
