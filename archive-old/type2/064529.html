&gt; RE:     Copy of: Brake dust from Hell
&gt; 
&gt; Hey all,  Need some advice on removing STUBBORN brake dust from alloy wheels.
&gt; Don't even bother suggesting stuff like &quot;Armor All wheel cleaner&quot; and the like.
&gt; Lemme just say I have even tried mineral spirits and a stiff bristle brush to no
&gt; avail. The damn stuff is on there like paint!
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody got any solutions of a solution that'll take this crap off without
&gt; eating up the clearcoat?
&gt; 
&gt; chris

If it has a clear coat on it, then rubbing compound or wax should remove 
the black. If it is straight alloy, then try some aluminum polish (sold 
at motorcycle shops, and such). I remove most of the dust from my car at 
the 2-bit car wash. The &quot;tire cleaner&quot; seems to take it all off.
