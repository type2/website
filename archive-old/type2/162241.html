Subject: Personal Account Update

 Dear Valued PayPal Member,

During our regularly schedule account maintenance and verification we
have detected a slight error in your billing information on file with
PayPal.
This might be due to either following reasons:

- A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address)
- An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due
an internal error within our processors.

Therefore your account has been temporarily suspended. We need you to
confirm your identity in order to regain full privileges of your account.
However, failure to update your records will result in account
suspension.

If this is not completed by August 14, 2006, we reserve the right to
terminate all privileges of your account indefinitly, as it may have been
used for fraudulent purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in this
manner.
To confirm your identity please follow the link below:

Thank you for your patience in this matter.
