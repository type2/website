Subject: '76 Bus in CA for parts/project

List,

I am moving to TN and must trim the fleet.

I will be leaving behind a '76 weekender body devoid of
engine/seats/windshield and maybe a few other nicknacks I care to steal from
it for my '79 project.  It is currently registered in CA with DMV sticker
indicating a '79 CA engine upgrade.  As mentioned, I am taking the engine.

I am entertaining offers for sale/trade etc.  I'd rather it not go to a junk
yard or sandrail dude on ebay.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks,

Billy
Visalia, CA  93277
