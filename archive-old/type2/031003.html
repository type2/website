&gt; i'm headed for arizona on friday, with the intention of buying a westy and

&gt; which was to skirt south of colorado, and stick to I-40 most of the way to

DON'T.  

you are trying to drive an unknown vehicle into some of the highest
roughest terrain in the lower 48.  I took my well driven, well known 65
westy through there some years ago and wondered if I would ever get over
some of those hills.  between Pagosa Springs and South Fork you have to
cross Wolf Creek Pass at 10850 ft.  that is one long long slow climb, and
then don't forget the run down the other side, what kind of shape are the
brakes in?????   

to give you an Idea when I went from Silverton just North of Durango to
Ouray just 23 miles it took 3 hours (including time to let the engine rest
going up and the brakes to cool coming down)

if you have the engine adjusted for that altitude it is not as big a
problem. locals were cruising by me, but I had flatland carb settings.

Stay on I-40 

this is not a trip to find out all the things the previous owner was
getting around to fixing and hadn't got to yet.

&gt; Are these pretty slow-going routes? Once i'm on the other side of the
&gt; rockies, it's a very straight, flat ride through the midwest. but i'm
&gt; wondering if what looks a pretty short distance on the map is actually a
&gt; lot slower 'cause of the mountains. [and the westy].

you bet your bippy it is slow going.

call your friend and stick to the lowlands if at all possible, I-40 is a
pretty smooth flat route (comparitively)
