Subject: [T2] ADMIN: UUNET BLOCK

This weekend we intend to begin blocking all mail that originated from a
UUNET dialup connection, as these connections are an incorrigible spam
source and a persistent pain in the ass.

I've done log analysis of about 9000 list messages to make sure this change
will have a negligible effect on legitimate list messages--it will stop a
very few messages per thousand. However, if you find your messages blocked
by the filter, write to me at &lt;bighouse_at_bellsouth_dot_net&gt; and I can make an
exception for you.

Earthlink sometimes buys dialups from UUNET; this appears to happen mostly
in Redondo Beach and Santa Barbara. If you use Earthlink and your mail won't
go through to the list, get with me at &lt;bighouse_at_bellsouth_dot_net&gt; and we will
figure it out.

This will not affect the UUNET dialups in Europe or Oceania, who seem to be
quite conscientious; it is solely the American UUNET that is sociopathic.
