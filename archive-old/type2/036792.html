&gt; Kudos on getting your first bus. In time, you will learn much about the
&gt; mechanics and lore of type 2s. First lesson: you know that &quot;ugly&quot; beigish
&gt; color? If it's the stock paint, you have a classic VW color on your
&gt; hands. Go have a look at the back cover of Laurence Meredith's _Original
&gt; VW Bus_ (Bay View Books, 1997). There's the color, albeit on a 1969 bus.
&gt; I like that color on a bus, and I wager that upwards of 50 people, at
&gt; least, on this list have a bus in that color. Far from ugly, many of us
&gt; consider it quite fetchin'.

Certainly didn't mean to offend :-) I think I know the color you're talking
about, and it is quite nice. Mine's a very poor attempt at repainting,
though - some sort of flat, rough textured paint. A guy at work went so far
as to guess it was some sort of military paint - certainly not original.

Guessing by the interior, the bus was probably all-over red. I went last
night to check the M-code panel behind the driver's seat to get the paint
codes, but the plate had been removed! :-( I understand I can send my VIN
off to the factory in Germany, and they'll send me my bus' birth
certificate? If someone could point me in the right direction for that, I'd
be appreciative.

I've received several good suggestions on what to be looking at when I tear
into it this weekend - thanks to all! I'm really looking forward to this
new trip!

Chris
