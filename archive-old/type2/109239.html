&gt; A 5000btu window unit is a much more practical solution IMO...

&gt;Where would you suggest mounting it so that wouldn't interfere with driving
or vision?

I have one. Only use it when I'm camping. After get set up it sits in the
drivers window and hangs from the rain gutter. I used it at Busses Nowhere
Near The Arch last year. Worked great!
