Subject: Re: [T2]age old question(OIL)

&gt;My '82 Westy has really taken to the 10w 30
Mobil One. ...I added one quart of 15w 50 Mobil
One...The reason I added 15w 50 was that the oil
pressure light stayed on a few seconds with
straight 10w 30 

Doesn't the oil pressure light come on at 6 psi
or so?  I would feel safe with pressure that low.
 



Happy bussin'
