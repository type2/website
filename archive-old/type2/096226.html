&gt; With the paint discussion that's going on I want to raise the question,
&gt; What about Imron?

greatest stuff since sliced bread
&gt; 
&gt;  I have a buddy who works at a place which manufactures big buck
&gt; industrial equipment for the road, and Imron is the only thing they will
&gt; use.  He says it's expensive, but they buy it anyway.

you ain't kidding it's expensive


&gt; I've heard it's not something you want to apply yourself, but I've asked
&gt; a local body shop if they'll spray it, and they say sure, just bring
&gt; your car in prepped and we'll shoot it for you.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd really like to hear from someone who knows from experience about
&gt; this product.

Ok I have used it and in the industry I'm in (Transportation) we use a
heck of a lot of it.

Imron is a two part epoxy rather than a paint. you get 3qts and 1 qt and
mix. at that point you have about 30 minutes to pain AND clean up your
tools.    more paint sprayers have been ruined by Imron...
it takes a LOT of presure to spray the stuff.  I seem to recall we used
85psi in our guns.  in fact to paint our buses we fired up the bus and
tapped into the brake system for the air supply.

but when you are done you will have a bullet proof paint job, and you
better like it because your stuck with it.....and nothing sticks to
it.  bus companies now use stick on decals because other paint doesn't
stick worth beans....

great stuff   IF..........
