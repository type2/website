&gt; &gt; &quot;As to the tinted option, I've heard that because of the high driving

&gt; I chose the tinted option when I had a windshield installed the other week and
&gt; I have no problem with the tint being in my view. I in fact like the tint
&gt; better than the no tint at the top because it definitly helps on the glare. Of
&gt; curse the tint is no lower than the bottom of a sun visor that has been turned
&gt; down.

&gt; If you still have the option I would chose the tinted window.

I think that I was the one who commented about having to look through the
tinted region.  Keep in mind, though, that I'm 6'2&quot; and have nicely
rebuilt front seats.  Most folk would have no problems.
