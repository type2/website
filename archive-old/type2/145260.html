Subject: emissions saga

Hi guys and gals.  My emissions saga just ended and I thought some of you might enjoy it. 
  
  I've known for over a year that I was in trouble over my 76 westy and  our new emissions testing in my county (Hamilton, Chattanooga,  TN).  The new law is that any vehicle made after 1975 has to pass  the emissions testing applicable to vehicles for that model year.   Since mine no longer has a 2.0/FI/Catalytic/EGR/etc., I knew it  wouldn't pass.  I've got a 1.7, single Weber, 009, no emissions  crap at all.  I called Nashville and a lady told me to take a  letter from VW telling what had been done and they'd probably give me a  waiver.  Went to my local VW dealer and the guy was really nice  about it.  Basically signed a blank piece of letterhead.
  
  So Karl (thank you Lord for Karl) was of course able to pinpoint  exactly when my engine was manufactured.  1972, well before  emissions crap.  I take the bopmobile in to the center.  Nice  guy reads my letter and tells me that I'll have to see the state  mechanic at another location.  I call and make an appointment and  yesterday was D-day.  
  
  Anyhow, I go in and the guy says, 'Oh, I love these air-cooled  campers.  I've got an '81.'  He reads my letter and says,  'well, they've gotten pretty strict and the law says that if any  modifications have been done you can't get a waiver.  But I can  probably make it pass.'  So he tells me to take the stuff out of  the rear and get to the upper engine hatch and he'll adjust timing,  mixture, etc. until it passes.  He said it only had to run, no  matter how badly.  He asked me to start it.  I just reached  in, no gas, and she fired up and purred like she always does.  He  said, 'boy I hate to mess with that.  Let's just see where it  is.'  Well, he hooks it up and says, 'I can't believe it.'   The print out showed that with maximum allowable reading of 500, the  bopmobile came in at 260! I'm sure that wouldn't pass in California,  but then that's another reason I'll never live in California, ha.   (Nothing against Cali, it's just overcrowded and overpriced.)   So,   , I'm proud
 of the bopmobile today!  I'm legal again.  Cheers....KR
