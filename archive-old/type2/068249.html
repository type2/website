NO
A Torx and 12 point are not the same. Hoover goes on about this
in one of his Sermons, although I don't remember which one.
I found my 8mm 12 point bit at the local O'reillys, which
is a national chain American parts store. Try Napa, Autozone,
etc. If they don't have it they may be able to order it.
I paid about $6 for mine, qand worth every penny!! 

 
&gt; BTW, will a Torx bit fit those 12-point bolt heads?  Anyone know what
&gt; size?  If I try Torx, am I just asking for stripped bolt heads?
&gt; On the 12-point thingermajigger, if I do find a place that sells it,
&gt; what size do I need?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA,
&gt; Rodney
