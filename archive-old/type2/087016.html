&gt; To replace the cam plug, you *do* need to split the crankcase.
&gt; 
&gt; Now that I have made those bald statements, I want to ask the list... has
&gt; anyone ever put the plug back in with goop?  or tapped that hole and put a
&gt; plug in?  This is a problem I have never faced, myself.  I have read of it
&gt; and I have seen that plug often enough, but I have never had a problem
&gt; with it.
&gt; 
&gt; I *think* that it would be a tough road to tap it, since it lies on the
&gt; seam.  Any side force on the case halves would tend to cause a leak in the
&gt; seam, as I see it, but if anyone has a different experience, please post!

not sure I have never had any trouble with any of mine but I have oil heat
which means a tank, not sure about the clearances but they have an
emergency leak plug that is designed to make a quick emergency repair,
wonder if it or something similar would work....I suspect the clearances
might be a little tight though.
