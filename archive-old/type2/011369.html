Subject: Experiences with Auto Trans?
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

A fellow in my area has a '81 air cooled Westy for
sale. He's asking $4,900 which sounds high given the
seam rust, minor dings, bad canvas and bad water pump
he described to me over the phone.  He thinks it's
fair given the replaced parts, engine rebuild and
interior work (seats from later Vanagon; new carpet). 
This difference of opinion will be left to
negotiation, if any.  The biggest concern I have is
that the Westy has an automatic transmission.  I
really want a 4-speed, but could accept the auto. if I
knew it was reliable and reasonably/affordably
reapaired or replaced. 

Can anyone share their auto tranny experiences?  BTW,
if geography is a factor (shops or sources for tranny
maintenance), I'm in Chicago. 

TIA, Allen
