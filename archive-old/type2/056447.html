&gt;VOLKSWAGEN PLANS THEME PARK .... It wasn't enough to buy Rolls-Royce and

&gt;York Times&quot;. &quot;Auto City 2000&quot;, a theme park being built at a cost of
&gt;nearly $400 million near Volkswagen headquarters, is a testimony to
&gt;Piech's consuming ambition. It will feature at least eight separate
&gt;pavilions to showcase Volkswagen's brands, a luxury hotel, a yacht pier
&gt;and a museum that will let people test-drive cars in virtual reality.
&gt;Volkswagen also says it plans to bolster Rolls-Royce and Bentley

I saw the plans for AutoStadt 2000 while in Wolfsburg this past January and
a few weeks ago as well. Not only is there going to be this amusement
park/hotel, but the VW Museum is going to be in a new building at the site
which is about three times the size of the current museum.

The opening of AutoStadt (auto city) is to coincide with the Hanover Worlds
Fair in 2000. Right now Wolfsburg can only be reached by local train
service from Hannover or Brunschweig. The Deutsche Bahn is putting in an
ICE (InterCity Express - bullet train) line between Hannover and Berlin and
one of the stops along the way will be Wolfsburg.
