Subject: Road Draft Boot

Jason, Jamie, Robert, Jim: Thanks a lot for the info on the Road 
Draft Boot. So the problem is not on my friends engine but on all the 
others that I have worked on. Who knew!

Two neat things about this ACVW obsession:
No matter how many years one has been at it, there is always one more 
tidbit to learn.
There is always a group of addicts on this list who know the answer 
and are eager to share.

What a combination. Thanks,
jack
