Hi there,

        I've got a 73 bus, that had this problem until this weekend.
The other symptom I had was once the bus was warmed up (had to drive
for a while for this to happen) it wasn't as bad.  I did a few things
on Saturday, and the bus no longer had this problem.  So here is what
I did : 

        1) adjusted the points in the distributor (need to do this
before setting the timing)
        2) set the timming, it was way off (really far advanced.
timing for my bus is 10 BTDC and it was at 15-20 ATDC)
        3) set the idle to 950-1000 RPMs

These are the regular maintenace things.  I also did some other
things:  I have a breather hose (I think that is what it is called)
that goes from the bottom of my air cleaner on the carb to the oil
breather on the engine (you may or may not have this on your engine,
did you say a 71?).  This had a leak in it where it attatched to the
air cleaner, so I took care of that.  and also, where the carb mounts
to the intake mainfold (the tubes that go to the heads from the carb)
one of the four connections was bad (the boot was messed up)  I
cleaned that up, and then took it for a drive.  No more problems!!!


So I guess to make a long story short, the problem for me was due
either to bad timming or a vacum leak.  I'd get the timming down and
then if that doesn't handle it, look for leaks.  As for encouragement,
YOU CAN DO IT!!!!!!!!!  I am not really a natural at mechanical
things (pretty clumsy:), but patience pays off.  Good luck.  Make sure
you let the list know how it went, good or bad.

take care,
        brandy
