 I have a 74 westy with a recently rebuilt 1800, dual DRLA 36 dellorto
carbs(recently rebuilt).  I am trying to work the bugs out.  The vehicle
seems to accelerate fine through 3rd gear, although when I push the
accelerator too hard, I can hear a whirling noise, which goes away when I
let off a bit.  Any way, once I get in 4th, it will accelerate very slowly,
and only reach a speed considerably below what top end should be.

When sitting still and revving the engine by hand, the engine is very
responsive.  I seem to recall a thread about this, but I can't find it with
any of the search words I have been using.

thanks, joel lambert, atmore al   75 bus, 74 westy, 79 wrecked bus
