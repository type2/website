Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof solutions for former poptop campers??

Hi Bryan and Everyone else,
If you aren't in love with this vehicle, and it
doesn't sound like you are, why not sell it to someone
looking for a Westy.  Westfalias are worth more than a
passenger van or even a Kombi.  You could buy or trade
for a better VW for your needs.  There will be much
less hassle, and we keep another vintage VW original,
everyone wins!  

Just a thought,
Rick

&gt; Yeah, the more feedback I get...  the more I think
&gt; I'll just weld a new roof
&gt; into that hole.  It will be some work, but not as
&gt; much as the sunroof it
&gt; seems.  :-)

&gt; &gt; for what it is worth, I had a 60 with a sunroof. 
&gt; hated it, never could
&gt; &gt; get the thing to seal.  always leaked from day
&gt; one!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ragtop measures out to just fit in, I still may
&gt; just weld a new patch in
&gt; &gt; &gt; place of the hole.  Sounds like the water issue
&gt; may be more trouble than
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; can stand.   Thanks again everyone for the help.
