Subject: Re: [T2] heater cable stuck in tube

On my 73 I ended up cutting the front end off the
cable and pulling it out from under the van, it was
very hard to pull out, hooked on to another car and
pulled it out that way, like I say very hard,I don't
know what I would have done if the cable had broken in
the tube. Phil
