Subject: Re: List T-Shirts

Hi, I am new to this list (about a month or so) and was wondering how I
would be able to get one of these cool shirts. Who do I need to contact to
do that and are there any left for us to buy.
Thanks

&gt; 
&gt; Just got my list t-shirt today - great job Richard.  This is one of the
&gt; coolest (and most unique) t-shirts I own.  The only thing that could
&gt; have been different was to make the camper blue instead of purple then
&gt; it would look just like mine! :-)
