&gt; Dear Volks
&gt; 
&gt; I have a '68 crewcab.  Apparently in the normal '68 bus (and probably other
&gt; model year loafs) there is an air duct that goes across the front from the
&gt; center to the left and right sides at about a foot above the floor.  Part of
&gt; it on each side goes up to the vents in the dash.  Part apparently mates to a
&gt; vent duct going through each door to provide vent air to the rear of the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; On the crewcab, the duct does not pass through the door.  Instead the duct is
&gt; blocked off on each end by a metal plate approximately 4 x 6 inches.  My
&gt; crewcab is missing the left hand plate.  Can someone who has a parts book or
&gt; fiche tell me the part number for this?  Does anyone have one for sale or
&gt; know a source for one?  I've tried Wilson's already.  For a part bus, it has
&gt; to be either a single or double cab.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, David Hunt

David:
I think those plates were used on type 2's of the 230 model also
(Kombi's). This would include Campmobiles in this country. I've got one
to look at, but it's a long way from here.
Can anyone verify that campers 68-71 or so did not have the
thru-the-door-panel air ducts for the back seat?
If that's the case, the cover should be really easy to find.
