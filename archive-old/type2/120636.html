Subject: windshield wipers re 76 76 wireing

ok so i look at this closer and the one to be installed has a solid black wire and a solid green wire ......
those seem to be the only ones diffrent.....
 
ok and matching these together i come out with  that leaving the black wire with white stripe left on the one being taken out and a black wire with green stripe...
 
so question now is....
 
(being taken out)black with white stripe to  == (installed)solid black or solid green...?
 
(being taken out)black wire with green stripe to ==(installed) solid black or solid green?
 
i hope all that makes some sense for someone that has done this before..?
peace
Chris
