Subject: [T2] gas leak on left turns

     My 76 Bus leaks gas when I turn left.  It might sound awkward but it's 
true.
     The gas drips from the right rear quarter of the vehicle and 
occasionally from the small seam that joins the quarter panel and the side 
panel.  I've traced the problem to those mysterious pipes that are visible 
through the outside vents in the rear of the vehicle (I confess I don't know 
what they do).  From what little I can see, they are rusted -- I suspect 
this is causing the gas leak.  From my view they appear impossible to get to 
wothout removing a lot of sheet metal and making a huge mess.  Furthermore, 
how would I replace them?
     My gas mileage is needless to say horrible so any advice would be 
appreciated.
