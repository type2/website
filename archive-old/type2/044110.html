Subject: [T2] Engine &amp; Emissions Testing
Content-Disposition: inline

&gt;this, the engine has been replaced with a DP 1600 that has no compression in
 &gt;one cylinder.  Even that isn't a real problem, what I'm worried about is
&gt;this.  Can a rebuilt, and well tuned 1600 pass the emission tests,in New
&gt;York, that would be required for a FI 2 liter, that should be in there?
&gt;For what it's worth, the engine conversion looks to have been well done.
&gt;Cooling tin and engine compartment seal all around.  Wiring and lines and
&gt;hoses are all neat and secure, ect.

I've been getting Buses passed in New York over the past 10 years with little
problem, even though you could see the street from the inside on alot of them.
However, due to the new emissions machines installed at stations last
year which cost each station 40k + to install, stations are required to run
buses 73 and newer on the dynamo. Earlier buses receive only a &quot;safety&quot;
inspection,
which in the Metro area means they see how much they can get from you, then you
give them the cash and they hand you the sticker. The high cost of
the machines makes the station hungry for $$$, so the cost of passing has gone
up. plan on paying 100+ if van isn't old enough to be exempt from emissions. I
know a couple of sympathetic inspection stations you could try in NYC, let me
know if want the specific addresses.
