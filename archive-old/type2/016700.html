I am in the process of rebuilding my bus, ground up.  I've never even had a
chance to drive a bus, just sit behind the wheel in the basement, so I'm
really new to this stuff...

The bus is a '75 with the original 1800, however, the EFI was gutted and
replaced with a Weber progressive and 009 distributor.  I checked the
archives and apparently no one has gotten this to work very well.  Is there
anyone out there that has?  I'll have the engine back together soon, and will
be ready to set this up.

TIA,
Robert
