I just ordered a 78 2.0 for a customer. No one seemed to have a 2.0 in stock 
right now the time to get a engine is 2 weeks right now and another week or 
so to get the engine to you depending where you live the and the engine cost 
1485 I beleive that is with new heads. Plus 250 shipping and 300 dollar for a 
core.Just a little more info

&gt; recommend the long block route.  It is quicker and much more cost 
&gt; effective as well.  dont know what delivery time would be but I show 
&gt; busdepot lists engines for just below 1100 before shipping/core/whatever
