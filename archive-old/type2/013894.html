Subject: Re: [T2] Rocker arm lubrication

Volks,

Thursday evening, I responded to a question on how the rockers get lubed
with the answer that they are basically splash lubricated.  The following
p-mail from Robb chased me down to the basement to look at some parts I
have down there in boxes.

&gt; Steve, actually, the pushrods are hollow for a reason. If you look at
&gt; the lifters, solid or hydro, you'll see that they also function as a
&gt; pump. While some oil is &quot;flung&quot; from the crank, the vast majority of
&gt; oiling to the rockers comes from the before stated pumping of the
&gt; lifters, thru said push rods. This oil is also under a fair amount of
&gt; pressure, as the smaller diameter of the pushrod tube has an
&gt; amplifying effect. Robb

Sure enough! What a neat system and I have been looking at its bits for
decades without even suspecting its existence. The oil gets pumped to the
bore for the lifter, out thru the lifter, up the pushrod, thru a passage
in the rocker and to the rocker bearing.  Fascinating!
