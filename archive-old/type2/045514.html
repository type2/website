Carron,

You are SO right!  

It would seem that the &quot;shift point&quot; is really a range of values, measured in 
rpm, mph or kph.  The low end of the range is shifting at a point where you 
have sufficient rpm to maintain cooling fan speed in the next gear.  The top 
end of the range is where you no longer get any hp, torque or whatever gain 
by rodding it any further.

Needless to say, it may INDEED come down to driving style. : )

A number of posts seem to have established or at least bracketed the top end 
of this range.  If getting to the next stoplight 4 seconds sooner is 
critical, this is the rpm to watch for.

What I haven't seen yet is the other end of the range that would interest 
drivers who &quot;enjoy the ride&quot;, cringe at $1.70/gallon gas and consider 
&quot;spirited driving&quot; to be exceeding the speed limit once in awhile on those 
long downhill stretches.

Anybody????? 

*Whats the &quot;correct shift point&quot; to just adequately keep the cooling fan 
spinning at sufficient speed to keep everything cool?  
*What rpm should we not let the engine drop below at each shift?

If this does come down to a simple issue of driving style;
*Will shifting at this hypothetical low end of the range save wear on the 
engine?
*Will it result in lower fuel consumption?
