Here's what my old Clymer manual has to say about it:

&quot;Repairs requiring disassembly of the transaxle are not possible
without a large assortment of special VW tools.   Most adjustments
such as selector fork positions and bearing preload must be done on
special test jigs; these adjustments are impossible while the pars are
installed in the case.  The price of the test jigs and special tools
far exceeds the cost of several brand new transaxles.&quot;

&gt; &gt;The info in the Muir book isn't sketchy at all. John Muir
specifically says
&gt; &gt;to stay the hell out of the transmission. He says you have to be in
practice

&gt; OK, maybe it is impractical to rebuild my tranny completely by
myself, but I would think that I could do most of it, and take it to a
machine shop to do the things that need tools I don't have.  As VW
owners, I think many of us have a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; approach to things,
and I'm continually amazed by the creative solutions to problems that
our list members come up with.  Of course, if I do try this tranny
re-build thing, I'll buy a housing for a tranny and all the parts, and
work on it in the garage while I drive with the original one.
