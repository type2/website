&gt; Tow trucks are high. You need a vehicle shipper. I had a westy brought

&gt; trucker will often give a very low price on the last empty slot on his
&gt; rig just so he won't make a trip with an empty slot.
&gt;
&gt; Is there someone you could borrow a spare engine from? Or is there a
&gt; swap meet coming up in your area where you could buy a used one cheap?
&gt;

what about renting a trailer to haul it home on, probably cheaper than
the plane tickets.

&gt;  I wonder if anyone in the Buffalo area knows of any
&gt;  place to have my bus professionally fixed so I can
&gt;  drive it home, or maybe the identity of someone who
&gt;  will tow it home for less than the $1,500.00 quotes I

yourself is the cheapest person.  I doubt a big U-haul truck and trailer
one way would cost anywhere near $1,500,  couple hundred maybe...
I say large truck because when I did it U-haul would not rent the 4wheel
car trailer to be hooked to anything smaller.
