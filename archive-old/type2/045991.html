Shelby Bell sends:

&gt; encountered this?   any thoughts as to why or tricks
&gt; to get it off besides heat?   the reason for my
&gt; disassembly is a rod knock.

Three cans of Liquid Wrench and a little convincing with a rubber hammer
(straight down on the fins, and not very hard at that) should do the trick.
