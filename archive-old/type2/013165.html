Thats it, little krummy speaker. 
Don't you have the little round jobbies in your doors?  they're krummy
too but if you want a set I'll give you a pair. They look nice but have
about a 4.5 Diameter and about a 3&quot; speaker inside.(80-91 Vanagon)
I'd just buy some good aftermarket speakers with low profile grills (i
did).
If you're hooking up rear speakers..most of the new radios use separate
wires for grounds, you'll need four wires to the rear speakers instead of
the old type with three wires. They appear to work on low volume with the
three wire hookup but it burns out the left/right channel in your radio
if you crank up the volume.
