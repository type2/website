&gt;Once in a while, the bus makes a chattering sound when I depress the clutch

generally, the bus slows down when the clutch is applied, and it is rarely
accelerating uphill with the clutch applied....

&gt;When I release the clutch pedal, the sound goes away and doesn't return for
&gt;a couple of days.

and so the noise is proportional to engine rotation and directly in relation to
the application of the clutch .  So let's have a look at the clutch release bearing,
which is most probably wearing out. and while that is being done, let's grease/replace
the pilot bearing. also a good time to determine the wear on the clutch disc and the surfaces
of the clutch disc and pressure plate. and so that leads to the replacement of the crankshaft
main seal behind the flywheel, and thus time to check the endplay on the main bearings.
all of these things are most directly related to the repair you need and the best time to do
them is when you have this direct access, at your convenience. and this is just a start. insofar
as you will have the engine out, this would be an excellent opportunity to polish the crank  8^).
