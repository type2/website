That site is full of inaccuracies, such as this one:

&quot;300 foot pounds of torque will accelerate you just as hard at 2000 rpm as 
it would if you were making that torque at 4000 rpm in the same gear, yet, 
per the formula, the horsepower would be *double* at 4000 rpm.&quot;

Huh?  Just plain wrong.  300 lb-ft of torque would accelerate you much 
harder at 4,000rpm!  If he had been talking about horsepower, that 
statement would have been true.

&gt;Yes, in a certain sense, horsepower accelerates a bus...because
&gt;horsepower is calculated from the rpm and torque numbers.

Yup.  And that's the bottom line, really.

&gt;More torque, then your hp numbers are gonna be higher...same torque at
&gt;higher rpm==more hp.

Right.  So you and I both disagree with the guy on &quot;vettenet&quot; (ugh).

&gt;Read the tutorial above...takes a while to sink in, but it makes sense.
&gt;And don't skipp to the bottom before ya read the top!

I read it, and as I said, it contains significant inaccuracies.  I wouldn't 
recommend that anyone accept that guy's statements as gospel.  Unless he's 
talking about Zaino -he probably knows a lot about that, being a vette guy 
and all.   :-)

A bus motor produces better hp at low rpms than it's peak hp would 
suggest.  That's good for driving around town but bad for rapid 
acceleration.  Given the intended purpose of a bus, that's an okay tradeoff 
IMO.
