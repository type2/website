Subject: Smoke from the dash!   No wasps in the junkyard!

Hi gang:

Had an exciting time of it on Friday.  I drove the '71 Westy to work 
for the first time.  On the way in the engine died as I turned into the 
parking lot, but restarted immediately so I thought little of it.  
Maybe just a little cold.

But on the way home it died again.  No idiot lites.  Key cranks but 
nothing fires.  Smoke starts billowing from under dash.  Joe 
scrambles for something to disconnect the battery with.  Can't find 
it.  Realizes he hasn't put an extinguisher in the car.  More smoke 
from under dash.  Joe sees a wire crisping and yanks at harness to 
get at whatever's shorting.  Disconnects the crisping wire and 
smoke stops, but there's still something sparking under there when 
I move the harness.

Turns out the fuse box had slipped out of its bracket and was 
shorting.  Smoked the 15 circuit from the key to the fusebox, from 
which coil, wipers, and all other switched-circuit goodies depend.  
It's Friday, everyone's going home, I'm ready for happy hour and a 
beer.  What to do?

I needed to hotwire the 15 circuit, so I needed some unswitched 30-
circuit juice.  The lighter doesn't work but I know it has juice; I pull 
the wire off it and twist it onto the end of the 15-circuit wire to the 
fusebox.

Yes!  Drove home uneventfully, nose atwitch.

This afternoon I dug around to see what the damage was.   The 
ignition switch was fine except -- no output at the 15 terminal, 
which I got to surprisingly easy by removing the four screws under 
the steering column mounting bracket.  All other terminals on the 
switch behaved normally -- ie, the starter turns over.  My guess is 
the internal contacts for the 15 terminal melted away. ;-(

So I needed a bypass until I could replace the ignition switch.  I 
dug up a toggle switch and mounted it in the dash hole where the 
(nonworking) AC control was.

Next, I inspected wires around the fusebox, replaced the burnt 15-
circuit wire, and made sure the fusebox was locked down.  Spliced 
my toggle switch's power-input from the 30-circuit going to the 
ignition switch, hooked the output to the fusebox 15-circuit, et voila! 
 Sort of a reverse on the old starter button idea.

Except: no headlights!  Parking lights fine.  Again, every terminal 
except the 56 out to the dimmer relay was fine.  Jumpered the 56 
terminal from the 30 input and got lights.  Another toasted switch.

Sigh.  and I *just* got back from the junkyard.  Fortunately, there's 
another one close to town; I just can't drive it at night until then.  
Think I'll get me a Bigass(tm) fire extinguisher in the meantime.

My junkyard trip Sat was happier; for one thing, I didn't get stung 
by bus-dwelling wasps nor almost expire from da heat as in my 
last visit in August.  Scored an outside rearview, heater knobs, and 
hubcaps for the westy (so there, Dave E.) , along with a mud plate, 
clock, and Sapphire II 6V AM-FM from a 66 Ghia (for my 60 Ghia).  
Of course, neither the clock nor the radio work yet :-) but I've 
already found the problem with the clock -- and even if it doesn't 
work, the radio is cooler looking than the dead AM-only one in the 
Ghia now.  Also scored a cool New Beetle holiday light string -- it'll 
be the perfect accessory when I've got the westy set up with its 
add-a-room at the campsites.

All the above was at Perry Mull's yard and store in Valdosta, GA 
(Mull's Fun Bug - see www.sevwc_dot_com &amp; you should find a link 
there somewhere).

Yours in kitsch,
Joe
