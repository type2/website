Subject: Re: [T2] mailing into canada.

Hi Jack,

My personal preference is US Postal Service. Note that this is VERY slow (~6
weeks) currently on the west coast.... the problem is with Canadian Customs.
East coast deliveries are not a problem. I wonder if this has anything to do
with the ongoing softwood lumber tarriff dispute???

UPS adds a $40 &quot;brokerage&quot; fee to a cross-border transaction, and should be
avoided where possible, particularly with low-value shipments.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts


Quoting Jack Hattaway &lt;jack_at_law.utah_dot_edu&gt;:

&gt; What is the best way to ship a used part into Canada?
