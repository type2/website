Subject: Re: Need 1600 D/P rebuilt in L.A. area..

&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt;Here's da problem.  Small horizontal crack between #3 and the 
&gt;oil cooler case plate (doghouse) on a 1600 Dual Port.  Options:
&gt;
&gt;1)  Get it welded by a pro with aluminum welding equipment. Getting
&gt;    mixed signals on this..
&gt;
&gt;2)  Buy a rebuilt engine.  Here in L.A. I saw a rebuilt for
&gt;    $385.  I might find one around greater L.A. a little cheaper..
&gt;    (anyone know where ???)
&gt;
&gt;The current engine is really good except for this stupid crack that
&gt;manages to pump out oil.  Because of where the crack is, the head and
&gt;cylinders have to come off (wouldn't 'ya know).  Labor costs may get
&gt;close enough to may the new rebuilt worthwhile.  
&gt;
&gt;Ideas and opinions welcome.._dot_decision is Monday afternoon..
&gt;
&gt;TIA !

  I have to sympathize.  Even if you get it welded, it's a total 
 strip and clean. 

 It may get warped. Then need &quot;line bored&quot;.

 It doesn't sound good unless it's a very special case.

 As for a &quot;rebuilt&quot; for $385, you better hope it's &quot;stolen&quot;.

 I bought one for $600 down there maybe 5 years ago. 
  It was &quot;alright&quot; and a single port.
 It ran for maybe a year with no major problems, just a &quot;work car&quot;.

 The &quot;parts&quot; for a rebuild will cost that much, or more. Not including
 case or heads.

 If you're in for &quot;adventure&quot;, it sounds good!

 The important thing is if you're having fun, right?!     west
