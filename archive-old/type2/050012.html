excuse the friday-ish post, but..

This reminds me of a statement about bussing that i came up with recently -
applies in a round-about way if you think about it;

&quot;Owning a VW bus is not about having smoke rolling out the windows when you
arrive somewhere, its about NOT having smoke rollling out of the engine
compartment&quot;

Most people that drive them are pretty nice, but some of us that build them
are sometimes more comfortable negotiating with machines than we are with
people.

justa thought,
clark
