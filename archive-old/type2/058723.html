&lt;&lt; Hiya Campers:
 
 The official campground for this year's Bug Jam is (I hear from 
 Larry Melgren) Campground Quail Run Campground (813) 973-0999.  From 
 my digging online and in the DeLorme atlas, this puppy smells like an 
 RV lot.  It appears to be 5-6 miles from the show.
 
 I'm leaning more towards Hillsborough River State Park, which is 
 pretty and has the advantage of being a whisker closer to Tampa -- my 
 fantasy plan being to fahren down from Continental Florida to the 
 campground Friday, visit the Bulli Brigade in Tampa on Sat (11/7), 
 back to the campsite, and then up to Dade City for the show on Sunday 
 (11/8), with a return trip to Tallahassee on Sunday 
 afternoon/evening.
 
 If you're interested in Hillsborough River State Park, check out 
 http://tampa.info-access_dot_com/hills.htm.  The official park page has 
 rates and phone numbers: 
 http://www_dot_dep.state.fl_dot_us/parks/HillsboroughRiver/hillsboroughriver. 
 html.  This is a pretty spot, one of Florida's very cool Civilian 
 Conservation Corps-built locations.  Somehow it ain't camp without 
 those log-and-limestone buildings.
 
 If you want to coordinate caravaning and/or camping from the 
 Tallahassee Quadrant, lemme know.

Joe is right, the quail campground is more or less a RV park. Some people have
told me that you hear the 18 wheelers all night because its right beside the
Interstate. And the talk of the State park is not bad. I have heard that the
Georgia boys are staying in a State Park, same one? Is this the same one Dave?
The only reason you would wanna be closer to Tampa is for the Bulli Brigade,
but the Bug Jam is farther north, actually closer to the motels and the quail
campground.
