Subject: Re: [T2] EFI swaps

Hi Mike,

Correct. I have swapped 6-pin and 7-pin setups and not noticed any  
significant performance difference.

In theory, there could be a problem at very high RPM on a 2L running  
1.8L ECU, because there is more airflow through the system than the  
ECU was programmed for. But with redline at 5400 RPMs, it isn't an  
issue for real life operation. No-one revs that high (intentionally)  
anyway.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

  Should be no problems except for mounting stuff.
  You'll have bigger valves which will make for slightly
  less low end grunt - maybe. If you are concerned about
  too much fuel (should not be a problem) I suppose you
  could put a T3 adjustable fuel pressure regulator on
  it and that would allow adjustment of fuel mixture
  across the board. The FI system doesn't know there is
  200cc difference - it only knows airflow and
  temperature. -BaH
