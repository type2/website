&gt; It seems a shame that the very automobiles that gave VW their start in the
&gt; car market are now considered outdated by the dealerships.

Actually I think that is a professional and fair statement. After all they
are there to sell and service modern cars. I'd rather they tell me openly
they can't do that sort of thing anymore than that they try and screw up.

Remember - we are the funny lot -
