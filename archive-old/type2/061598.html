Subject: 23rd Psalm for the holidays.

Hi Volks,

With the religous holidays coming, I thought you might enjoy this


The 23rd Psalm

The Volkswagen is my chariot,
I shall not want another. 
It maketh me lie down in wet places. 
It leadeth me into muddy waters. 
It hauleth my stuff. 
It leadeth me in the paths of tribulation for it's namesake. 
Yea, though I run through the valley at 45 per, 
Iam towed up hill; 
for it'sengine quitteth on me. 
It's springs and shocks torture me.
It prepareth a breakdown inthe presence of my enemies.
It anointeth my head with oil.
It's heater worketh better in the summertime. 
Surely service and repairs shall follow me all the days of my life; 
and I will dwell in the house of the Mechanic forever.
Joy thru air,

Jamie
