Subject: Alt. and Fuel Press. Reg. Questions

Greetings. Two questions for the combined resources of the List. 1) Is it 
possible to get a high-output alt. For a ' 78 2.0L Westy. My 55amp. model is 
just not going to cut the mustard. I know that a 70amp model was offered, but 
had a different cooling boot. Where can I get this set-up? 2) Does anybody 
know where I can lay my filthy little paws on an adjustable, rising rate fuel 
pressure regulator for the above mentioned eng./FI combo? I've decided to 
play around with the idea of modifying my AFC box, and installing injectors 
that will support a larger volume of fuel for the same pulse width. Any help 
would be wonderful.
Thanks Again,
Parker
