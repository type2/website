Subject: For sale or Parting out 79 automatic westy

Hi,
I was planning on putting a diesel engine in this and running it off wvo.    
But I got a good deal on a diesel ford trhat already has 2 tanks.
I still hope to make a diesel westy some day, but only when I can afford 
such a project, and not when I'm with no car waiting for it to be my daily 
driver.

The bad:  I have the engine.  It needs the heads put back on, new push rod 
tubes, and a new head cylander gasket (the metal ring)  I do not have any of 
the fuel injection stuff or the muffler.  The windshield has a crack and the 
paint sucks.

The good:  everything else is pretty good.  All the camping equipment works. 
  The canvas is only a few years old.  The cabinets and all the fabric are 
in pretty good shape.  The auto tranny works. (I also have a spare for 
parts).  Tires have lots of tread.

Make an offer.  I don't really want to take the time to pull and ship 
anything for lewss than $15 unless it comes off real easy.  I would prefer 
if someone wanted the whole thing.  I can tow it (within reason) if you rent 
the tow dolly and pay for diesel.  But I will part it out if noone wants it 
whole.

Thanks,
Kyle
&lt;/pre&gt;
