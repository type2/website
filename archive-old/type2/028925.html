Hi Steve,

Single double-door / sliding door Split Screen Busses had a continuous panel
on the side opposite the doors / door, but I believe all '68-'79
Transporters (and other years of the same design) all have the seam.

My previous bus (a '73) appeared to have no seams on the side opposite the
door simply because a previous owner had filled them - presumably in an
attempt to create a &quot;Kewl Cal Look&quot; bus (&lt;start joke&gt;have you ever noticed
that people with that sort of bus can never spell properly? &lt;end joke&gt;).
That's probably what you remember having seen.

Happy Easter

....

What I want to know is, were any buses produced that did *not* have
provision for an off-side sliding door? That is, a continuous panel from
the B pilar back to the rear corner. Was it certain years? certain models?
If you have a bus without this seam, please let me know.
