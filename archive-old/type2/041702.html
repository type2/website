Hello,
 I would look at the wire attached to the idle cut off valve. On the side of
the carb. When you turn off the ignition, power is cut at the valve, which
closes it, This cuts off any excess gas from getting sucked into carb.

P.S. my wire was loose and caused the run on.

&gt; My newly rebuilt 1600 single port engine seems to be running on a little,
&gt; mostly once it's warmed up. Any ideas?
