fuel inFection questions

This vehicle came to me,,, in &quot;Great&quot; running condition although it had ZERO
compression in #3 as the intake valve seat had dropped.
I have put a rebuilt head on it, and have just put it back in the Bus.  

I am having problems getting it to stay running .... it won't idle 
it will fire, and you can rev it up and it will stay running 
Now , Every time you turn the key, it fires up,, runs for about 4 seconds , then
dies off

I am going on the assumption *I* forgot to connect something,,,,,,, or connected
it wrong.

Q1
I found 2 wires I didn't mark, they are the efi white wires, both come out of
the harness about 15cm away from the computer , and they have markings #40 , and
#12  on the wire?
What are they for,, I can't find them in the bentley diagram

Q2
I hope I didn't screw up the vacuum lines,, the large lines are straight
forward, the small lines I connected so that the air box and the distributor are
connected to the throttle body.
The Decel and the fuel regulator are connected to the intake air distributor
Is that correct?



Here are the facts

date of mfg - 6/77    s/n 237216XXXX
reman VWcanada engine with code GE on the sticker
low miles on engine
2.0 liter hydraulic valve lifters
stock fuel infection 


I set the hyd valves at 1.5 turns past tight
Dwell is 50 deg
timing is 7.5 Btdc
Vac is 17  and steady while it runs for 4 - 5 seconds
fuel pressure is 30-35 lbs 
compression is 135 in all 4

Q3
The CHT was 200 deg when I decided to tested the temp sensor II on the #3 cyl
head, It is about 250 ohms, and Bentley calls for 2500 ohms.
I am not certain if I have a spare to try in its place.
Would the temp sensor have an effect on running?  

Thanks
