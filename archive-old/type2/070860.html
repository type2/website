Subject: inconsistent idle
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have a '75 camper and I recently did a valve and timing tune up for my bus. 
After which, the idle has been rather inconsistent. When the engine is cold, 
it would die for puff of gas and I cannot release the gas while I am still 
trying to warm the engine, if not it would just slowly die away and stall the 
engine. And sometimes, not always, it might suddenly stall (warm engine) 
while I clutch in to stop or in the middle of a turn. So if anybody recognize 
such symptoms, advices are more than welcome. Thanks!
