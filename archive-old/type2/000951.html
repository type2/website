Subject: &quot;70 Westy vs. '01 Cadillac braking comparison
Date: Wed, 6 Jun 2001 19:48:36 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Driving along at about 50 mph following a brand new Caddy, the stop light
ahead turns yellow, the Caddy is going to make it for sure, and if he's
going to go for it, so am I, so my foot's still on the gas pedal. Then about
100 feet before the light, the Caddy slams on the brakes, I stand on the
brakes with all my might. I'm gripping the wheel and bracing for impact. To
my surprise, I open my eyes as I come to a full stop, and I am so close to
this Caddy, I cannot believe we had not made contact. I have a spare mounted
on the nose of my bus, and I'm sure it's hanging over the bumper of the
Caddy. I can see the old fart in his side rear view mirror glaring back at
me. I don't care as I am so relieved I didn't just cave in the nose of my
Westy. Sure the Caddy would have been fixed, but it would have totaled the
Westy. Drum brakes do work, although I hope to never have to test them like
this again.
