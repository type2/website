&gt; 185 x .78 = 144.3
&gt; 195 x .75 = 146.25

205 x .70 = 143.5 

even closer to stock
&gt; 
&gt; this is your sidewall height.  True, this DOES vary from manufacture and
&gt; model....but.
&gt; 
&gt; I can attest to the fact that the Y370 195/75 is definitly more massive

the Michelin MXT (iirc) that I run are much wider and it handles much
better, I chose handling over looks and go with the bigger tires

oh well this FART is well worn, but my tires are new
