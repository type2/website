Subject: How much do you love your bus?

Questionnaire for Bus Lovers

1.  Do you enjoy driving your bus on beautiful spring days?
2.  Do you enjoy talking &quot;Bus&quot; with other misfits, I mean enthusiasts like
yourself?
3.  Do you enjoy driving your bus on winding roads through beautiful tree
covered hills?
4.  Would you rather drive your bus than mow the lawn?
5.  Do you love your bus so much that you look for excuses to take it
somewhere?
6.  Do you enjoy joining in bus caravans to fun places?
7.  Have you been wishing you could join in on one of those wonderful bus
campouts?

If you answered yes to ANY of the above, then have I got a deal for you!!
