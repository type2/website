Subject: RE: Mermen (no VW), bus music in general

        Musta been me, Bren. I think their particular brand of
psychedelic surf jazz is the perfect thing for sound-track while
driving one's bus, *or* working on it. I believe my ravings
resulted in Dworkin and someone else on the Southeast seaboard
catching them, and I seem to recall that Martha or Jeff S. or
another of our Bay-Area ilk had one of their tapes along for
a Baja expedition.

        Check it out at http//mermen_dot_com. :)

        I also find David Grisman Quintet, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, 
and Jai Uttal to be convivial bus music. Mostly instrumental so you can
think or talk around it, mostly ecclectic. Other than Bela and the 'tones,
these are all Bay Area musicians who may not be known outside our
region. Any other regional favorites among bussers? Christian K. and
I traded some pretty sharp tapes and I owe him another... anyone else? 

        Bill
