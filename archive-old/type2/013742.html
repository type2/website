&gt; &gt;around to first finding out how to install it into my bus, or

&gt; 
&gt; Biggest issue is that unless you got one from a hardtop bus you are
&gt; SOL.  Those do exist but real, real, real rare for the post '76
&gt; interior.
&gt; I am assuming you did not install the poptop on yours.  The ceiling
&gt; cabinet usually bolts to the closet cabinet and ceiling on the
&gt; closet side
&gt; and then to the ceiling on the passenger side.  But all that to the
&gt; flat
&gt; Westy bed ceiling.  I have no idea in the world how the hardtop one
&gt; goes in if you were lucky enough to find one.

I just double checked my bus, and although my ceiling cabinet is MIA
(snif), the brackets for mounting it are still there.  There are no
ceiling mounts for the hardtop that I can find, only the four side
mounts (2 left and 2 right) and  T shaped bracket on the wood hinge
cover that I cannot truthfully verify as original.

I might suggest here that you check one of the Westfalia Camper
manuals that can be found online as they describe in detail how to
remove and replace the camper interior.

Hoping that this helps!
