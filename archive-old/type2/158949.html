Subject: Friday question: VW activity in LA in July/August

Hi

Work is sending me to LA on July 13th, I plan to stick around until the 
begining of August, its very different to here, so worth spending some 
time.  Is there anything to see VW wise in the area at this time (if my 
wife will let me go)

Thanks
John
