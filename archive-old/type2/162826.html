Subject: Re: [T2] Coil Autopsy

Shad obviously knows more about modern ignition coils than I do.
However:

&gt;  Ignition
&gt;coil is an induction coil, and relies on the collapsing magnetic field
&gt;of the primary to create the high voltage spark on the secondary side.

	These coils have normally been autotransformers, i.e a 3-wire 
not a 4-wire device (external connections notwithstanding).  In an 
autotransformer, one end of the primary and secondary windings is 
connected.
	The schematic of an ordinary (4-wire) transformer is 
(utilising beta version of Gates' latest $999.95 advanced 3D color 
kompughter graphics package):

		_____
		(
________	(
	)	(
________)	(____


	whereas an autotransformer schematic is:

		_____
		(
________	(
	)	(
________)_______	(____


	Old coils may well contain PCBs which had good physical 
properties for the purpose but are among the more noxious liquids 
known.  Do not incinerate; pass along for Mafia processing  ...   :-}
