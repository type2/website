&gt; Don't feel too bad.  I also misread the torque wrench when I replaced
&gt; my heads.   I ended up with 21 inch pounds instead of 21 ft
&gt; pounds.  Naturally, this was discovered after I installed the
&gt; engine.  And no, you can't reach all of the head bolts with the
&gt; engine in, so I had to pull it out, re-torque, and re-install (alone).
&gt;
&gt; That was a long day.

Coupla years ago I was helping a friend do the final rehooking
after a clutch job. We replaced all the tin, wires, etc...When I
happened to look at the box with the old clutch in it...Unfor-
tunately there was also a new and old throw out bearing in it...
Stoopid clutch... ;-(
