Subject: Re: Pushrod tube tips

hmm... reminds me of my failure to read the section on installing the 
heads this time when i re-putogethor the engine for  the bus &lt;with epoxy 
in the holes in the heads:)&gt;...after i got the heads torqued down, and 
the pushrod tubes seemed like they didnt fit right, but i said to hell 
with it... put it togethor the oldfashioned way...then after i did and 
was cleaning up, i read the instructions...slap! oh well..:)

&gt; Ok, I just managed to get the heads off my '74 and I learned something
&gt; new: the pushrod tubes come out *through* the heads.  I thought that the
&gt; heads needed to be romoved to get the tubes out.  My lame manual say
&gt; nothing about this feature that I discovered by accident.
&gt; 
&gt; This good luck saved me a lot of time and frustration tonight, so I
&gt; figured I'd pass it along in case anyone else is silly enought to actualy
&gt; try and pull one of these monsters out of their post-72 bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Further updates on the head swap coming, along with photos on my web page.
&gt; BTW, when I looked at the number 2 exhaust valve, I noticed why there
&gt; wasn't any compression: the valve moves at least a quarter inch sideways
&gt; in any direction.  Yikes!
