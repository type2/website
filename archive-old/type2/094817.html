Subject: Re: [T2] z-bed confusion

&gt;I didn't realize how much a slight mis-alignment of a bed can play
&gt;havoc on your back untill HCBF. Anyway, can someone tell me how
&gt;exactly these beds are mounted?


The ascii drawing was awesome.....on my westy, for the back of the z bed 
it's just cusion, there's no wood behind it but i'm not sure if my zbed is 
exactly like yours.

If it would help you are welcome to stop by and check out my zbed, i'm not 
that far away....i can't meet you anywhere though as my bus is running on 
three cylinders
