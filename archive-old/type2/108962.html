Subject: Re: [T2] Travel Prep

&gt; I have been working on gettin  the fridge operational, but to no avail.
 All of the wiring seems to trace out alright, but there is no action
 when I flip the switch. The unit has not been run in awhile (I don't
 think the previous owner used it in  the 3 0r 4 years he owned it). I am
 thinking I'll simply tear it out and replace with a new, 12V cooler,
 unless someone has some idea of  a trick I am missing.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Whoa!!!  Before you tear it out. It is an ammonia fridge. All it does is heat up one end and this causes the
other end to freeze. It has no moving parts, it makes no noise! Under the door with the grille on top is the
temp control for 110v. The heater ONLY runs on 12v. If you do not have an aux battery it will only work with
110v plugged in to your house. Plug it in, turn it on to City Power, turn the knob full cold and let it sit
for 3 days. The ammonia gels. This will wake it up.
The aux battery is ONLY to be used to maintain the temp while driving, not when you are parked. It will
totally flatten the battery in 6 hours. When you are parked, use 110.

This fridge does work and it will make ice cubes. The 12v coolers are junk. They will only bring the temp down
40 degrees below ambient temp. On a 105 degree day, that is only 65 degrees!
