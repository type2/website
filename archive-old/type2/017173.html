Subject: louvered window

I own a 73 weekender or transporter with a fold down bed. I would like
to replace the windows on the sliding door and opposite side, with a
solid window. I see that they sell a rubber molding for this type of
widow, but I have never seen one. Can any one tell me if they are
available, and where. Or does someone have a pair they would like to
sell. I would like to know of a source of patterns and kits for west
interiors. Like paneling and headliner panels and door panels hatch
panels.
Thanks for being there
