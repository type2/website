If you look, he says that he has a type 4. Look on page
123 of the Tom
Wilson book and you will see that this will not work.
There is only one stud
holding the stainer cover on, not the 6 like a type 1-3.
If you grab this
with Vise-grips and twist it, you risk destroying the
case! Don't do it.
This &quot;stud&quot; look like a bolt with a loop on the end, this
loop is
sandwitched in between the two case halves and has a bolt
going through the
middle. No amount of twisting will get it out. Splitting
the case is the
only option, this sucks, but I know of no other way. It
could be why there
is that warning of only putting 9ft lbs to it to get it
tight.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have a 72 bus and just today I was changing the oil
&gt; and the oil filter.
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; changed the filter then after I drained the oil. I was
&gt; putting the oil
&gt; drain
&gt; &gt; nut back on and the stud snapped. 
&gt; &gt; The engine that I am currently having this problem with
&gt; is a type 4 if
&gt; thats
&gt; &gt; any help!
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, Hercules, if you can clamp a set of vise-grips on
&gt; the remaining part
&gt; of the stud, try that first. If you can clamp on a
&gt; vise-grip, the stud
&gt; should just screw right out. Since this stud lives in
&gt; oil, it's not likely
&gt; to be rusted in.
&gt; 
&gt; Also run outside quick-like and unhook the ground from
&gt; your battery; this
&gt; will keep anyone else from trying to start your Bus.
&gt; 
&gt; A couple of days with no oil in it, so long as you don't
&gt; try driving it
&gt; anywhere, shouldn't hurt your engine. (I would say won't,
&gt; but absolutes are
&gt; bad here.)
