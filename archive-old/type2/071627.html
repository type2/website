Man, I've been out of the bus scene for twenty years..but it all comes back to
you
do *not* bend the float arm on the solex carbs! the float height is set by the
thickness of the fiber washer under the needle valve assembly...
OK.....now..USE ONLY NEEDLE VALVES MARKED &quot;SOLEX&quot;!!!!!!!!!!!!
even the &quot;Autobahn&quot; brand of kits from VW have junk needle valves..the 72 bus
was marked 1.2 or 1.5..heck *I* don't remember but find your old needle
valves, go to VW and order the correct part...*OR* reinstall the old
ones!..I've yet to see an original one leak...I put the Autobahn ones in and
the next morning it wouldn't crank as the cylinder was *full* of gas.....get
new floats, too...worth the $$$
steve.......
