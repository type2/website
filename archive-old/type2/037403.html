Subject: Re: VDO tachometer problem            

Check your points.  When I first put a tach in my 69 Westy, it would bounce
all over at speed.  Based on what I had heard others say, and after
snooping around the engine compartment for a bit, it turned out the points
were pretty bad.  So I replaced them and have not have any trouble since.

4000rpm at 60mph does sound high, esp for a 74.  my 69 has a lower gear in
4th, and it turns 4000rpm at 65mph.
