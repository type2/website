Tom,

A simpler (much!) method, is to spray any/all
connections/junctures with hair-spray while the motor
is running at various rpm.....find a spot were the
idle changes when you spray? Well, you just found a
leak.

When you're all done, rinse the motor off with a hose
(hey, it probably needs it anyway;-).

This can also be done with starting fluid, but I don't
recommend it; *way* too flammable for my tastes!!!
