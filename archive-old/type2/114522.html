Subject: engine removal help...again/still. 

Listees, 

This week I posted a plea for help to remove my 1500 stock motor from my 67 ghia. Jay on the list was able to help me over the weekend, but now I find out that I wont have access to the car in the bodyshop over the weekend, it will have to be during the week. 
So here goes again. Anyone on the list within reasonable driving distance to Southern Maryland have interest in making a few bucks on the side pulling the motor from my ghia? The car is located In Hughesville MD about 30 miles south of DC. It is in a bodyshop ready for paint but the motor needs to be pulled to be rehauled and so the engine compartment can be sprayed. I can provide tools, a Haynes manual and a Muir. Issue here is that I need it to be pulled during the week. The shop closes by 6PM or so. I dont need you to haul it or anything, I have someone to do that. I just need it pulled. 

Thanks .
