Subject: Getting out of the vw hobby/80 vanagon camper project FS

Hey Folks,
   I have a 1980 aircooled vanagon camper project for
sale.  I just had a baby and have no time to complete
this project.  Currently the motor is out, and 95%
rebuilt. (all the hard stuff is done)  It needs the
motor assembly completed (FI system and exhaust) and
the engine needs to be re-installed.  The rebuild was
done by myself with the help of an ASE certified
mechanic.  It also needs rear brake cylinders.  ALL
rebuild parts are OEM german parts.  Van is orange and
brown in color.  Has BRAND NEW tires!  Im asking $1700
This is far less than I have invested in the engine
parts alone.  The Van is located in Minneapolis MN. 
Please pass this on to any folks in the Mpls area. 
Please email direct at lexluthier72_at_yahoo_dot_com with any
questions or photo requests.
                         Thanks.
                            -Erin R.
