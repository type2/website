Consider two layers of carpet. Your floor will need to &quot;breathe&quot;, or else it 
will rust. I have a layer of carpet over my rubber floor mat, which has a 
honeycombed back, to allow for air circulation. In my old van, which had no 
mat, I used two layers of carpet, and when hauling nasty stuff, pulled the 
bottom one out and put it on top. For nice, I kept the nice one on top. Two 
layers of carpet makes good heat and noise insulation.
