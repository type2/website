Subject: Re: [T2] plugs and gaps with CDI
To: glyle_at_lenti.type2_dot_com, Type2_at_type2_dot_com

Been running the Tiger 581 CDI, Pertronix Ignitor, and Bosch +4 Plat. plugs 
for almost two years now ( 33,581mi) on my ' 78 2.0L FI Westy. I had access 
to a chasis dyno at the time I did the swap-over from stock ign. parts. 
Gained a total of  4.87 rear wheel hp.( _at_ 4278 RPM) 9.73ft. lbs of torque,( _at_ 
2970RPM) and about 3.1mpg avarage,( Stock eng.,  82,000mi., original.) with 
the new components. Was it worth it? To me, hell yes. No tune ups. Change the 
plugs every 60k miles or so. Never check the advance again. No hassle starts 
at -10f. More Torque, no points bounce, mis-fires or weirdness associated 
with a Kettering Ignition System. Will the 200.00 price tag buy you a butt 
load of points and condensors? Yup. Is it worth it to almost NEVER have to 
jack with my Ignition System?  To me, with a business, wife, two kids under 
four, and a Westy that is my Daily Driver, all I can say is , Hell Yes.( And 
thank GOD for Hydro. Lifters!!!)
Later,
Robb
