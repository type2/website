yee how.....0-60 in 4days 8hr 27min

I once looked into powering a 71 bus I had with batteries, my uncle is an
electrical engineer and the more we looked at it the more I decided the
technology wasn't mature enough
 &gt;
&gt; For *future* fuel use I would suggest research into Hydrogen. It's
&gt; even cleaner burning than coal, and is easier to store and
&gt; transport.  Hydrogen can be produced with solar, wind, hydro-electric
&gt; or nuclear power, or though the burning of fossil fuels like coal,
&gt;
&gt; If the media stopped trotting out the old clips of the Hindenberg
&gt; burning down then we could look forward to DRINKING the output from
&gt; our bus's exhaust pipe.

don't look now but a few major cities in the world (including USA &amp; Cdn)
are already using H2 in their BIG buses. so far none have blown up or even
had a major mishap... the technology isn't quite ready yet but very very
soon coming to a city near you, transit buses power by H2, can our little
buses be far behind..?


happy new years to all

Bob
