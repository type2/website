Subject: Found in fuel tank

I was having a problem with the fuel gauge not working in my bus; troubleshot 
and found the problem to be a faulty fuel sender in the fuel tank.  I removed 
the bad sender and for the heck of it took a flashlight to look in the tank 
for dirt, rust etc.
Lying in the bottom of the fuel tank was a fuel nozzle from a filling station 
pump!  About 8 inches long with the heavy steel &quot;spring&quot; coiled around it and 
the tube for the automatic shutoff on the pump.  It is an old one from the 
'70s too as the fuel nozzles today look different.  Someone must have filled 
'er up and drove off with the nozzle still in the tank and broke it off.  
Anyone else find anything interesting in a fuel tank?  Rocks?  Marbles?  I 
remember when I was a kid  ; )
