Subject: Re: [T2] Paint question...

&lt;&lt;And as regards using' a roller to paint...There usta be a product sold
in the UK called &quot;coach paint&quot; for doing' that. You need a dust free
area and lots of wet sanding between coats to get a nice finish...But
hey, lots of cars built in the pre-war period (that's WWII&gt;&gt;

Yep,
That paint was called japan paint.
Model T's were refinished this way as well as horse drawn coaches.
 
Sand,paint let dry, sand , paint let dry,---until there was enough paint
on the surface to sand and rub out.

I believe it was a lacquer based product, and mostly black in color.

Big tedious process.

There was no &quot;In by 9 out by 5&quot; back then.
