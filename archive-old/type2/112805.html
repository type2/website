Is this really necassary?  everything i've ever seen, read, and been 
told says to only glue down the cover side... then again it's never been 
explained why.  so it begs the question - glue down the head side too? 
 Why or why not?

Sorry to keep dragging this thread on but I'm learning a ton here.
