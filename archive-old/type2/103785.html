Subject: Re: [T2] Camper headliner

&gt;Here's a nifty solution for the peeled vinyl.....we removed it from the
&gt;wood panel, and then covered it with fabric (Walmart, showing the busses
&gt;and bugs)- lay the fabric on a flat surface and stretch it evenly withy
&gt;weights around the edges. Spray glue the removed panel.  Drop it on the
&gt;fabric and walk all over it.  Let dry.  Cut around the edges about 1&quot;
&gt;overlap.  Fold over the edges and sprayglue.

My procedure is a bit different but that is exactly what I'm doing to the 
horizontal wood panels in the back of our bus and the wood headliner over 
the front seats.

My difference is that we are using a thin layer of foam rubber (like found 
under vinyl tops on American cars). $4 a yard.

Bit more sound insulation, bit more soundproofing, bit more &quot;luxury&quot;.
