 This is my first Thanksgiving on the list. I fell like the prodigal son
returning home (in his red VW micro-bus with shovels and rakes and other
implements of destruction).
  Regarding the brake failure: 

        1. Replace the wheel cylinder. In my experience rebuilding your own is
never a         satisfactory  solution. The brazilian wheel cylinders seem to be a
little iffy these days,
        but you will almost assuredly get brazilian rebuild kits too, so there's
nothing to be   gained there.

        2. You will have to replace the brake shoes on both sides. You have to buy
four shoes      anyway, so the only thing saved is the labor to put them on.
I've done it thinking I         could save the other pair for the next time I had
a leak. WRONG!!! The brakes always      pull to one side or the other and never
seem to balance themselves out. Besides, if you         had a failure on one side,
it's a good idea to have a look at the other side. Nothing hard         about any
of this.
        
Good luck, and keep 'em running.
