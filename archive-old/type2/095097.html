Subject: RE:  [T2] The DEATH BUS an SUV in disguise! 


&gt;&gt;Now the problem is that my old front tires were 75's I had the shop put on 
&gt;&gt;2 60's in the front. What are the potential problems of running 75's on 
&gt;&gt;the rear and 60's on the front?

&gt;&gt;DZ

The problem is that, not only will you NO LONGER be able to stop in 167 feet 
from 60 MPH ( BTW, how long, in seconds, do you figure it took you to come 
to a complete stop ? ?), since the 75's on the rear probably have a greater 
circumference than the 60's on the front, your rear tires will be traveling 
a greater distance per revolution (Che LIVES !!) than your front tire, so 
eventually the rear of your bus will catch up, and probably PASS the front 
of your bus, so that you will, in effect, be driving down the highway 
BACKWARDS!!

So, you had better check your rear view mirrors as often (more often than in 
the past) as you check your tire inflation, because you really don't want to 
spook those other two VW passengers again.

Now, let's hear it from the speedometer crowd.

(  Hey, don't blame me, this is the way I was brought up.... )
