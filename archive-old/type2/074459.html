Subject: Dyeing your dash...

Well folks a Champagne Edition brown dash is no long brown. Worry not, it 
wasn't very brown before I got started. The PO had hacked the radio hole a 
bit (not visible from the front) and I added 3 instrument holes between the 
radio and the ashtray. My brown dash had started turning black in a few 
places from the sun.

This a good way though to make a black dash brown in case you want to 
create a Champagne Edition for yourself.

I have repainted the bus, and the interior will be getting new colors, and 
the brown dash needed attention.

I'm going with a two tone scheme with a black top and a dark grey face. I 
used general purpose black vinyl dye spray paint from a basic FLAPS and 
bought good dye in a dark grey color from a paint and body supply store, 
and both gave excellent results. Could have got all my materials at either 
place.

However - the good stuff had a better valve and seemed to cover better. 
Less overspray, easier to control the amount of dye getting to the dash.

I removed and disassembled the dash COMPLETELY. Will be painting the metal 
top portion of the dash closest to the windshield (very faded and paint 
weathered away) with a black BBQ paint which in my experience has a nice 
balance between gloss and flat. As I said the top vinyl portion is now 
black and the face grey. The vents will be colored the same as the surface 
they are part of (top defroster vents = black, and the end of the dash 
fresh air vents are grey now).

I'll have to replace the foam inside the fresh air vents because it is 
falling apart. Will use that soft foam I was bragging about last week that 
I used on the front vent flappers outside. Bought it from Lowe's Hardware. 
It is pipe wrap.

I after disassembly I cleaned the dash with a  cotton towel and mineral 
spirits. Eventually the dash lost it's shine (a good thing, no more 
Armour-All or  it's like) and once dried I washed it once more with lacquer 
thinner to clean the mineral spirits (which is oily) off. I missed one 
place in a corner where the instrument clusters sits and it caused the dye 
to crinkle a bit. I have to spot that with more dye after I wash it clean 
again.

First coat was very light, next 15 minutes later a bit heavier, and 15 
minutes later the final coat. It dries in 15 minutes and can be in the 
weather in 2 hours. I looked last night and I'll have to spray the dash and 
top one more time because there are several places along the edges that 
didn't get enough dye.

There was a short learning curve b/c I got too much dye on the top piece 
and it started running (it was also cold in my garage ---&gt; ~50 degrees). I 
cleaned it off immediately with lacquer thinner (mineral spirits just 
caused it to glob up), allowed it to dry and sprayed it again.

It will look like it is puddling quickly if you get too much dye on it but 
will settle into the material when it dries.

Dries to a semi-gloss that is waiting for your favorite spray shine.

Gee that was easy!!!

Ciao!
