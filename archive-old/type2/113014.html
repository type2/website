Subject: Re: [T2] Children in a T2 camper ?

(Most ot the 78 Westy can be seen at
http://www.geocities_dot_com/mike_benthin )
My daughter, now nearly 18 with her own 75 bus, literally grew up with
our 78 camper, acquired in 86 with 60,000 mi on it (a pair of ladies
used it to go to Fla from NJ).  Now it has 243,000 mi and is still going
on the original drivetrain.  It was used for camping, shore trips, and
day trips with the bicycles.  Pretty much a daily driver, used for
shopping or hauling anything.  Had its own potty so I never had to deal
with public rest room issues.  The Pakapotty that is less than 14&quot; wide
fits readily between the sink cabinet and the rear bedseat. Back when
she was in the infant seat, I turned around the front seat ands
installed a lap belt to hold the baby and booster seat.  The front cot I
replaced with my own design foam board bed that rested on the dash and
stored over the roofbed.  Later, on trips, she enjoyed watching TV in
the back using an extra shelf I built over the fridge unit.  Then she
got a Sega, and in 95 it kept her busy on our 10,000 around the country
trip.  Now we use a laptop with DVD movies. The only thing we missed on
our trips was air conditioning, and Caframo fans helped when we were not
moving.  Now when she goes on rides with other friends in their cars,
she feels rather confined and bored!   I'm sure others will tell you the
advantages of a Westy and children.  WHen I went to Germany twice, I saw
lots of High Roof Vanagon campers.
