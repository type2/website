Myself and Boston Bob are  the only guys in the Business, that put hours of
testing, and do research for the better Bus engine.....Mass producers make
for mass headaches, and a massive pain in the but if something does go
wrong..

&gt; &gt; I've been reading some of the things posted on the list about GEX.  All
of
&gt; &gt; them have been bad comments.  I was looking at there website b/c I need
a
&gt; &gt; new engine for my bus. After what I heard I don't think I will buy from
them
&gt; &gt; but could someone tell where I could get a good 2 liter from for my 72
bus.
&gt;
&gt; first you need a core or old motor... check junk yards etc, sometimes
&gt; folks here have blown engines that are basically decent they let go cheap.
&gt;
&gt; now that you have a core.  check your wallet.  how much work are you
&gt; willing or able to do yourself....
&gt; figure a two liter rebuild from a decent core will run you at least
&gt; $1200-1500 base and go up as you do other jobs or farm out some of the
&gt; work.
&gt;
&gt; to give you an idea, about year and a half ago I rebuilt mine.  cleaned
&gt; case. balanced crank. new cam, new pistons and cyl.  all new bearings etc.
&gt; had the heads cleaned and new seats and valve guides installed. lot of
&gt; little things that added up.
&gt;
&gt; paid to have the bottom end done by a good machinist with VW
&gt; experience. did the top end myself..._dot_came up just short of $2,500
&gt;
&gt; I hope to get at least 100k miles on this engine before major work needs
&gt; to be done again...
