so i got to arizona today and i looked at a pretty rough '71 westy. I got
there as the dealer was closing, so i didn't get to drive it - i'm going
back tomorrow for that. but the price is right - only $1995 and negotiable.
They say the engine is fine, and i have a gut feeling that these are honest
people [plus a few folks on the list have recommended them].

anyway, here's what i know is wrong with it - looks like the poptop seals
will al need to be replaced. I haven't seen the canvas yet. The interior
panels are homemade-looking, and really ugly. i'd want to replace those,
probably with good 1/4&quot; veneered plywood [my friend's '73 bug has african
Bubinga-wood 1/4&quot; veneer plywood on the interior panels, and it's really
nice.] I think the seats are either going to need a lot of attention or a
complete replacement. the tabletop is also in need of replacement. The body
is solid, a couple wrinkes in the back, but it doesn't look like there's
structural damage. minor surface rust under the back driver's side window.
it needs a paint job and a little body clean-up, but it doesn't look like
anything serious.

any of the custom interior stuff - new carpeting, new door panels, new
tabletop, i'd do myself. but i'm wondering if anyone can give me an idea
what it'd cost for stuff like new pop-top seals [installed, if it's a task
that requires shelter while doing the work], and a decent paint job. i
figure i should take the opportunity to do the paint job right.

any suggestions are welcome. By the way, thanks for all the responses to my
question about driving through the rockies. what a generous group of people
you all are - i got so many offers for places to stay en route! that's so
cool! I do believe i've been thoroughly scared out of going through the
rockies, at least on this trip, i'll probably head up 25 though because
i've heard the view is pretty nice.

oh yeah, if anyone knows of a 71-78 westy for sale in the Phoenix/Tucson
area, please let me know. I'll be looking aorund here for a couple more
days before i have to make a decision.

thanks again,
-perry
