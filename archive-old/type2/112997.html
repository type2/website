Could be a poor ground to the block from the plugs then, but I'm thinking
that's a long shot. Sorry I can't be more helpful, but let me know what it
is, now I'm REALLY curious.

Triple checked all vac and elect. connections= all are where they should be.
The only thing that I can think of was that I used some anti seize compound
on
the threads of the plugs. It is not on the electrode. maybe I should go get
a fresh set of plugs and put them in?

thanks for the replies!
