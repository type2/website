Subject: Bus Depot Now Hiring

The Bus Depot has full and part time openings, for customer service reps,
phone operators, and shipping/receiving clerks.  Full-time would be weekdays
11 to 7.  We always try to hire Bus enthusiasts for every position before
advertising to the general population, so I thought I'd start here.

The latter two positions require no experience and are entry level. As an
added perk, you get all the VW parts you need at wholesale.  We're in
Perkiomenville PA (40-60 minutes from Philadelphia/Allentown/Reading; 20
minutes from Quakertown/Pottstown/Lansdale).
