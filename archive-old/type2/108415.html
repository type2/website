Subject: exhaust stud woes

So I've been hearing an exhaust leak for a couple months, and last =
Tuesday I traced it by sound to the headers. Took off the tin and =
discovered my #3 cylinder (oh yeah, 75 camper with a rebuilt =
frankenstein 2L) is missing both exhaust studs. Went and found some =
studs but had a bit of trouble finding the right sizes. One of the =
tapped holes for the studs was 8mm - though awfully tight (when I =
installed an 8mm stud with locktite I couldn't get it screwed down quite =
all the way, but it's perfectly square to it isn't too big a deal). The =
other seemed to be 8mm, but an awfully loose 8mm. I got a stepped stud =
(10mm, 8mm) too to check but it was too big for this other hole. Tried =
putting in an 8mm stud but I could feel that it was quite loose. Sure =
enough when I got the header and heater box back on and tried screwing =
down on this one it just backed the stud out.

So I took it out, finished putting things together until I can figure =
out what to do, and started her up. Sounds fine actually, no more leak =
sound. So I figure tightening down on one stud was enough to seal the =
port to the header but I imagine that as soon as I take it on a drive =
where it gets nice and hot for any appreciable amount of time it'll =
start leaking. In fact when I took out the sealing ring (the oval copper =
one) when I took it all apart it was in peices and pretty burnt looking. =
I did replace them with fresh ones so I figure that's what is allowing =
things to seal with only 1 stud.

Okay so here's my questions:=20
-Is there some oversize (bigger than 8mm but smaller than 9) stud that =
might have been put in here (like the hole was tapped slightly larger)? =
Any ideas on where I could find such a stud?

On the other hand I could tap it but:

-I've tapped a spark plug hole and it was pretty easy but considering =
how big the flange on the exhaust header is I can see that the stud MUST =
come out perfectly square - so has anyone done this while lying under =
the bus and can you give me any pointers/advice?

-So what the heck does having a tight exhaust do anyway? The way I =
figure it, it must create some back-pressure into the system but how =
would this affect things like mileage, efficiency, and so on? Yeah I =
know it's not that important to know such things in order to drive Lucy =
but I'm the kinda guy that taught himself how to rebuild an engine cause =
I wanted to know how it worked.

And I think I've seen evidence of a few other people that are kinda like =
that on this list too...

Thanks!
