Subject: Re: Tom Noble Engines in seattle

Hi Zach,

I put a Tom Noble engine in my bus soon after I bought it in 1989, and it went
strong for 120K.  When I needed to replace the engine last year, I tried to
find Tom Noble, but I was told he was no longer in business.  Too bad.  He did
nice work.

Original Message:
Anyone ever heard of this outfit and where they ran off to?  My bus came
with some paperwork with thier info on it and I am trying to get a better
idea of just what the heck was all done by the PO(s).

See you on the road,
Jerry
