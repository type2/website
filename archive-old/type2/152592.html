Subject: Compression problem

Im not sure if it is my compression or not but my bus seems to make a very 
deep hammering sound around 25 mph. im not sure whats that caused by. I know if 
I but the gas down to the floor it kinda goes away. I just had it tuned up and 
it was great right up until that happened. I think it might be the # 2 
cylinder because that is the one that is not fireing. Im not sure what it is. If 
anyone has any  suggestions on what to look for or what to have done to it to 
check it out please send it my way.  
                                                                           As 
always thanks in advance,
