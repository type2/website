&gt; Well, another coworker

*cringe*

&gt; Somehow I feel in my gut that this has something to do with something you
&gt; have explained below, but I am not quite sure what it is or what I have, and
&gt; what are the implications for me getting my bus running again, and whether
&gt; or not I can use the 78 engine again.

Time to look at the transmission body and write down the numbers printed on
it. That will identify model and production date.
