Subject: new t/s switch

MANY mene tekel refrigerators to karl Vs and bob ollerton... i now 
have an NOS 211-953-513G turn signal switch to install! karl found 
thesamba ad like 2 seconds after the ad posted, and bob kindly sold 
it to me even tho i wasn't first to reply (it helped that the man who 
beat me had an early split, which couldn't use the part). I paid an 
extremely fair price. here tis:

now, two things; one, notice that my spare switch (with broken 
headlight wires) has MUCH shorter wires. The crimps appear to be 
factory, so i'm not sure what's up with that! i need to get under the 
dash this week and see what length wires the switch in the bus has. 
i'm also wondering if i shouldn't just go ahead and replace my 
flasher switch to make sure it ain't the root cause. no sense melting 
an NOS switch!

second, this thing has no lubrication on it internally - suggestions?

really, it is too pretty to put on the bus. i should frame it.
