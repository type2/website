Subject: Tranny gear oil was Tranny howl...

Listees,

So I've decided to change my tranny oil to attempt to stop my tranny whine. 
I dont' know what previous owner used.

This is what I currently have and I was wondering if it's good enought to 
put in my tranny (I've got 3 quarts of it):

Sam was saying you need GL 4 and not GL 3 (whatever that means) and this 
stuff doesn't say either. Also what size is that HUGE allen thing on the 
tranny to open where you put the oil in and and drain it?

Thanks in advance!!!
