Hello everybody

    This is the fist time i write. I`m 21 years and i`m from Portugal.
I`ve recently bough a 1969 1600cc bus  and in the last time i went to 
the mechanic  he told me that she has a compression problem, in one 
cilinder (i hope) about less 30%.and i don`t know what this means.

    i would like you to tell me what i can do to solve this problem. I 
would like to make a full repair and I`m just starting. At this time she 
is being painted and then the hard work starts trying to get it right. 
Next i will take the engine off to really see the problems. any tech 
help or comments are appreciated.


Thank`s in advance.

Paulo Gomes.
