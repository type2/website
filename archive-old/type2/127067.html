Well Mike I went out to the but a minute ago to prove you wrong. :)

Unfortunately everything you just said is completely correct. I KNOW I
have measured idle vacuum before on my other cars, which is where I
guess I based my incorrect comment. Apparently it must have been
manifold vacuum. This also explains why I don't have to disconnect the
vacuum when timing my bus.
