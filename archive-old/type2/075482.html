Subject: Re: [T2] Please help me start this old bus!

Aron,


I am still in the process of doingthe same thing on a 78 bus that sat for
8 years.

Pull the gas tank out and clean it....don't even think about it...it *is *
the easy way.  I spent 3 months trying to get mine cleaned out without
having to pull it....it don't work!  When I finally pulled it, there were
chunks of dead gasoline in it that were covering the pickup tube.  

Don't think about it, just do it.  Pictures are at 

http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/78bustankjob/

Pay particular attention to #12....yes, some of those are more than
1/4&quot; thick.

There are many other things that will need doing, but I'm sure others will
cover that.

Cheers, dave

&gt; what's up list,
&gt; 
&gt; I just purchased my first bus ('77 bay) a few days ago and I'm really 
&gt; anxious to bring her back to life. The problem is she hasn't ran in half a 
&gt; decade and has been sitting as a lawn decoration ever since. I was just 
&gt; curious to know if there are certain things I should do to the gas tank and 
&gt; the engine (oil change, etc.) before I crank her up...any help is 
&gt; grateful...
&gt; thanks,
&gt; -Aaron
