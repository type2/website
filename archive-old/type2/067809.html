Subject: '79 sliding door won't unlock

Good morning (again!),

First, thanks to all who helped me get my 'new' (and free!) '79 running!
Turned out to be all it really needed was a little tlc! It's running great
now!

Anyway, now it's on to the other ailments.

The sliding door will not unlock. The key will turn, but the internal lock
knob will not come out of the lock position. The outside handle behaves as
it is locked. Any suggestions on fixing this?

Thanks again,

tony
