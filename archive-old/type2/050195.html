Hi,

The beta of the TRG sparked enough interest to quickly move forward 
with the project. The TRG is now sporting frames, a table of contents 
based on the Workshop Manual and quite a few new entries. Some of the 
main groups do not have any entries in them yet. I have more URLs to 
sort through but after fighting with HTML all evening I have grown 
weary. I will post updates every week or so until the TRG becomes 
stable. If you have input or feedback let me know.

The page is located at http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~ncbus/trg/ for now. 
If TRG gets big enough perhaps it will get its own domain or at least 
move to a better neighborhood.


Thanks
Chris
