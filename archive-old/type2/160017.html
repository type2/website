Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic lifters for 1.8L

&gt; Grupp, I have been researching hydraulic lifters and prices to get  
&gt; them here,
&gt; (Canada), and I have been made aware of two types, one has a &quot;wire&quot;  
&gt; snap ring
&gt; holding the lifter together, and the other one is like the Febi  
&gt; lifter with
&gt; installed steel snap ring to hold all together.  Has anyone on the  
&gt; list had
&gt; experience with the first mentioned type versus the second  
&gt; mentioned type?
&gt; Price seems to be a big factor between, but that cannot always be a  
&gt; barometer
&gt; of quality. Thanks

i believe the first type with the wire ring are brazilian, and cheaper.
