It slides up and down. You use it to lock the hatch when you are in the back
and want to sleep etc. Up will allow anyone to push the outside button and
open the hatch. Down, and the person outside can push the button til they
are blue and it won't open.


&gt; My 70 Westy has that little black knob on the inside of the rear hatch. I
&gt; know this subject came up recently on the list, but a search of the
archive
&gt; did not turn up an answer to how this is supposed to operate the lock. Do
&gt; you turn it or move it in some direction? I don't want to force it and
break
&gt; it like my other 70.
