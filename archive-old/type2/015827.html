This is a well-known problem with an equally well-known fix.
The fix involves adding a starter relay, and it is fully
described in John Muir's book. See St. Muir for detail.
I've done this to the last three '71 busses that I have owned
plus I've added the fix to many of my friends VWs.

In a pinch you can crawl under the bus and use a nickle
or a quarter to start it by shorting from the battery terminal
on the starter to the wire that heads to the starter switch.
