Subject: Sniveling Lurker no more!

OK, I've been lurking for about a year now and I just found a camper
here in Massachusetts back in July.  It's a '72 poptop camper that's
been painted a god-awful aqua color (originally Sierra Yellow) and has
big homemade fat tires on it.  Of course, to fit those kewl tires, the
PO cut the rear wheel wells...  :-(  Besides that, it's in very good
condition and virtually no rust.  I'll be welding in replacement panels
this winter for sure.

Now here's the stumper to the list.  It is not your typical US model '72
Westy.  I've had fellow list member Jon Hathaway take a look and we're
unsure of which model it is.  It has been rumored to have been a
European model.  Let me describe it in hopes that someone knows what it
is...

The fold down bed/bench is full-width.
Since the bed/bench is full size, there is no side cabinet next to it.
There is a thin cabinet (about 10&quot; high?) that runs the full width of
the bus above the bed/bench.
The bunk in the pop-top is a pad on a board thingy that is the full
width of the poptop (not a typical cot deal).
There is a full height cabinet behind the driver's seat.
Sink/fridge cabinet behind the passenger's side.
Walk through.

We looked for the model number in the usual places but found none...

All indications are that this is the original, factory interior.  Any
guesses?
