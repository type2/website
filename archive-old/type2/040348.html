&gt; Is your shock absorber OK?  If it is dead that could very well be why it
is
&gt; sagging.

Unless you have coil-overs or air shocks, only the springs control ride
height.
Shock absorbers are one of the most mis-named car part in the USA. They do
NOT absorb an ounce of shock. The springs absorb the shock. The shocks then
dampen the spring travel. They are 'travel dampeners'!
It doesn't matter if you have a new shock or an empty shock, the ride height
will be the same.
