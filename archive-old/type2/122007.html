The problem arose when I used an SK 11mm tubing wrench
(before anybody asks, it's a box wrench with one flat open
so you can get it on a brake or fuel line fitting...) on the
lines from the master cylinder. For whatever reason, the
wrench wasn't turning the fitting and started to round off
the points...Luckily, I stopped and made sure I had replace-
ment lines before just cutting the tubing to free the mas-
ter cylinder. Couple this with the newness of the master
cylinder - 1 1/2 year old Brazilian VW - with an ambient
temp of 17 degrees F and you can understand my inter-
est in brake anti-seize...
BTW, what are the dealerships selling as genuine VW mas-
ter cylinders? German or Brazilian...?-(
