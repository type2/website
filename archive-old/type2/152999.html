Subject: 1973 VW Camper Bus (Sufari Style) For Sale - Boston, MA area

Hey Folks,

Much as I love my Buster, it's come time for me to sell my baby and look for 
another vehicle.

I've had Buster since I bought him from the No Name Garage in Eugene, Oregon 
in late June of 1998, and drove him home to Boston.  I've driven him across 
the country 3 times and gone to numerous camping trips and other events.  He's 
been in parades and saved many a camping trip, and run countless erronds when 
needed.

Here are the positive aspects of this vehicle:  Since I've owned Buster, I've 
put a lot of love into this bus, installed inside lighting and a 12Volt DC 
electrical system with 12VCD plug fixtures (all fully fused), a nice sound 
system, had the brakes redone, extra wide tires installed, front end alignment, 
shocks, new gas lines, new generator, converted to a weber single carburator 
system, new front windshield gasket installed,  a whole new clutch cable system 
with rewelded cable guides (so no more breaking clutch cables!), had a new-used 
transmission installed and all the linkage and shifting fully tightened up and 
redone, and got the heater working (for what ever it's worth!).  A  new Gas 
Guage and float system were fully installed about a year and a half ago. 

Most all of the repair work was done in the first three years of owning the 
vehicle, and the rest over time when needed.  This bus is an original West 
Coast and Western Canada Bus.  I have not driven it on salt roads since it came 
back east.  It has started to get some rust and very minor rot here or there.  
I've done my best to keep up with it.  Body is in very good shape.  It will 
eventually need a nice looking paint job.  

Bus comes with a working electric refrigerator 12VDC/120VAC setup, sink, 
stove top with propane tank attached the bottom of the bus,  fold out bed, table 
and bench set up, storage areas underneath the benches, coat closet in front, 
an inverter that converts 12VDC to 120VAC 60Hz Electrical Service.  Bus has a 
second deep cycle battery.  It works but needs to be replaced.  Original 
battery is fine.  Nice storage area compartment above the driver and passenger 
section of the front cab.  Have installed oil temperature, oil pressure and voltage 
gauages up front. (ALL have come in handy from time to time and have helped 
me to baby this bus on long drives - you bus owners know what I'm talking 
about!).  Also has a spare tire in front.  I have 2 large ramps that can be used to 
raise the bus up to work underneath.  Original Canvas extension roof and 
poles are still useable.  

This is a Red-Orange colored bus with a white extension style roof on top 
(that does not collapse).  You can stand up inside the vehicle.  This is a Sufari 
Style Camper style set up.  

This is a four speed, with an 1800cc rebuilt engine (pancake style).   

Now the down side: Sad thing is Buster is going to need a new engine really 
soon.  It still starts and runs, but piston #3 is on it's way out.  It's 
occasionally firing unevenly and occasonally has a clicking (rattling) sound in the 
engine when it gets worse.  I still drive him on short trips around town, but 
this is getting increasingly difficult to do.  I don't have the funds nor the 
knowledge on how to fix or install a new or rebuilt engine, or just simply 
repair it, so I'd just assume sell it to someone who loves busses and will give 
it a good home and a good engine.  It in return it will give you many years of 
good service.

This is not a mint vehicle but with some work, could easily become one.

I'm looking to try to get $2,500 or best offer for him.   If you are 
interested, email me, and I'd be glad to tell you more and would be glad to talk more 
by telephone at that time.  I don't have digital pics yet, but will take some 
soon and be glad to share them.

Thanks all!   I hope you can help me find a good home for my buddy!
