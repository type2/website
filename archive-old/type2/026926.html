Hi All!

I have a '71 and the wiper motor runs very slowly. And there isn't much of a 
change in speed between low and high. Is this normal or should I be looking 
for a new motor or is it possibly something else? I've look around and, of 
course, a wiper motor seems to be one of the most expensive single part you 
can buy for your bus!! &gt;:-(
