Subject: Cool Resource

In anticipation of my &quot;new&quot; bus, I went to my local VW specialist store to 
buy the things I will most certainly need (fuel lines, etc.).  The new owner 
had just taken over the store the day before.  He's getting a tow bar for 
busses to loan out for free (small deposit).  And that will save me around 
$160 in UHaul fees...
&quot;Local&quot; is Nashville.
That's totally cool of them.  Anybody use a tow bar before?  I'll be dragging 
the bus around 100 miles...
