Hello David..............Since what I can contribute isn't directly about 
type 2's, and is more about trailers, I'll send you a second post to your 
off-list address, with an attachment of photos of a trailer I used in 
Europe. We lived in for months at a time.....wife, self, 8 yr old daughter. 
Hope your spam filters don't shred it.
