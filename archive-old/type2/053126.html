Well folks, it looks like it's now available 3rd millenium style.  So, I'm
going to ask everyone who asked for a copy to check it out (see below).  If
you can't print it out in a way that's legible, ask me AGAIN (be sure to
tell me it's your second request, that way I'll keep them straight), and
I'll be glad to send it on.

Fair enough?

&gt;John, et al,

&gt;and
&gt;http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/dolly_big.jpg
&gt;
&gt;the first is 103K and fine for seeing and printing at home.  The second is
&gt;*huge* (4.2 meg)  and for those with access to professional facilities.
