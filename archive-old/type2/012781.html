Subject: Negative cable first or &quot;Look ma, I'm a welder!&quot;
To: VW Bus &lt;type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Barry wrote yesterday asking why you remove the Neg
cable and not the Pos cable.  I just wanted to share
an experience I had with my long departed 86 Golf. 
Mind you I was lucky, I could have reenacted the
Hindenburg explosion but just damaged some metal.

Anyway I was disconnecting the battery for some reason
and didn't look close enough and started undoing the
positive cable which conveniently enough is on the
outside edge of the car and turned the wrench far
enough to contact the body of the car. ZOT!  I don't
think I got shocked but it sure scared the crap outta
me.  I knocked the wrench loose and checked out the
damage.  The wrench cut a notch in the fender and
there was a matching notch burned into the wrench. 
Amazingly enough nothing was damaged.  I still have
the wrench as a reminder.  Ditched the Golf though.
