Subject: Vegas to Jerome Anyone?
Message-ID: &lt;3A079404_at_operamail_dot_com&gt;
Mime-Version: 1.0

Anyone passing thru/leaving from Vegas for Jerome next Friday?  Even though my 
newly rebuilt engine is humming along just fine, I wouldn't mind some 
knowledgable (or not so knowledgable) driving companions.  I was planning to 
leave around 4:30pm but can leave either sooner or later.

Once again my girls will be camping with me, so if you're bringing kids, my 
5,3, and 1 year old will be looking for playmates.
