Subject: Bus parts and exchange rates

I took it upon myself to resend the following, because many listees are 
doubtless deleting messages with the WR1 subject heading:

Ron from Bus Depot wrote:

&quot;The fall of the dollar also has a lot to do with it. Everything 
imported is skyrocketing in price because the dollar is dropping to new 
lows every day. Most indications are that this will only get worse over 
the near future. If you need any imported parts (and most VW parts are, 
of course, imported), I _strongly_ advise you to stock up now, because 
huge price increases, industry wide, are almost a certainty. This is 
not a come-on but an honest assessment of the current market. 
Everything I'm reordering is costing me 10-25% more because of the 
dollar's fall, and every other importer's seeing the same thing. Prices 
on many parts are going to skyrocket.&quot;

And Richard Atwell concurred:

&quot;This is good advice. I deal with CDN currency conversions all the time 
and it really hurts right now. Right after the election it just went 
zoom.&quot;
