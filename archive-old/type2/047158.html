&gt; &gt; Put a 5 ft. length of Radio Shack antenna mast on
&gt; &gt; the end and use the
&gt; &gt; bathroom scale method of torque application.  Soooo
&gt; &gt; much neater than the
&gt; &gt; hammer whacker method.

&gt; The &quot;bathroom scale method?&quot; Please explain, this one
&gt; sounds good...

OK say you don't have a &quot;Big Ass.........&quot;
This is where math beats brute strength.  Foot-pounds means feet times
pounds.  Stand on a bathroom scale where you can apply force with your
breaker bar.  Say it's a 250 ft.-lb nut.  Mark the bar 5 ft from the center
of the nut.  While watching the scale, when 50 lbs. is taken OFF your
apparent weight, therefore applied to the nut, times 5 ft., you have 250
ft.-lb.
