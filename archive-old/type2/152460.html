Subject: Re: [T2] bay window market crash?

Sellers,
Although I was looking for an early bay, I would have been a good buyer to
fool into your busses :-)

Last year at Thanksgiving I flew to Minnesota to buy an overpriced and not
so well running bus. I drove it home without doing any &quot;tune-up&quot; because I
had no idea how this would be done on the bus.

Darn, that was a big nonsense :)). The less you know about busses, the more
you are ready to pay, ready to take the &quot;vintage&quot;, &quot;collectors&quot; BS, even
though we are talking bays and not splitties.

May be getting a new or used left door check strap, thanks Karl for part#
