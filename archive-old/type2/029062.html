&gt; It [METRIC] is standard, but in backwards countries like the youess the
&gt; inch-measure sockets are a _lot_ cheaper!

Tell that to NASA.  : )  Those were some pretty expensive 'bullets' they
fired at Mars awhile back!

I've got the cast iron, read cheap _at_ss, hexnut impact tool.  To say it sucks
is an understatement.  I throw that on the Castlenut with a ~3 foot long
3/4&quot; breaker bar (which I've broken), and a 3' piece of steel pipe on that.
With Karen on the
cheater and me pounding until it moves, we get the nut off, and some fender
paint, and some knuckle skin, and some patience, and some complaints from
the neighbors...  Spend the money, buy the socket.  And get a breaker bar,
that's guaranteed for life.
