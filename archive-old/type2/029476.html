I think that if you're going to get picky about oil coolers you should go
the type 4 route with the shroud mod.  Used type 4 coolers are generally
OK since the oil filter collects any debris that would otherwise lodge in
teh cooler.  My gut feeling is that all type 4 coolers are probably
German.

problems.

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; Just wanted to know if there were any opinions about German doghouse oil
&gt; coolers vs. Brazilian.  Are the German ones really worth the 190.00 that
&gt; Berg sells them for?  I can't imagine they cool any better so is it 
&gt; that they will last longer or less prone to rupture?  
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly I wanted to thank every one for their patience while I complete
&gt; this rebuild.  I realize I've asked some lame questions and I appre-
&gt; ciate everybody's time in answering them.
