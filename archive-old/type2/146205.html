&gt; 1)   Best way of getting the old starter bushing out? (I may or may not be 
&gt; dropping the engine this wknd.)
&gt; 2)   Best way of pressing the new one in? (put bushing on starter motor 
&gt; shaft and tighten bolts? Good idea or no?)
&gt; 3)   For the battery negative cable, does it matter that I have a normal 
&gt; battery cable, attached solidly to a seat belt bolt under my back set, or is
&gt; there some reason why I should have a braided type ground strap?
&gt; 
&gt; 

hello Tom  Take a tap a trhead the bushing when it gets to the bottom keep 
tapping and the bushing will come right out   2   to install tape the new 
bushing on a scocket that just fits the outside edges of the bushing use a long 
extension and tap the bushing into the hole # the ground really doesnt matter if 
its braided or not   later  Mark Dearing
