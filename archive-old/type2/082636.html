Subject: Re: [T2] Re:repair reservoir

&gt; The only way to repair a polyethylene, or polypropylene, plastic is to
&gt; hot air weld it----
&gt; And it is not an inexpensive proposition--you'd be better off buying a
&gt; new tank, for what the welding set-up will cost .

But something that may be possible with some ingenuity perhaps.
Like I stated maybe propane torch, or how about a heat shring gun with a
reducer nozzle. When you have a pretty obselete part and would like to
save it what do you do.
