&gt;&gt;WHO IS JACK SCHITT?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So now if someone says, &quot;You don't know Jack Schitt&quot;, you can

This is a corallary to the Saga of The Schitt Family, posted by DebiWebi
last friday.

____________________________________________
Wasn't there a bastard son named Horst?????? Yeah, he was adopted when his
whore mother latched onto a guy named Shinola. He had to, cause Horst
looked so much like him, everyone just assumed they were of the same blood
anyway.

Horst did alright for a common Neanderthal and landed a job at a fan
factory as the on-site shoe repairman for the factory workers and valet
services for the Cro Magnons in management.

He married Lotta Gotta. It was the Gotta-Schitt-Shinola wedding.

Need I go on??
