Subject: Oil Cooler washers - 2.0 Liter
Date: Wed, 27 Jun 2001 21:08:07 -0500

I'm sure the answer to this is in the archives, but I can't get a query to
complete right now - just hangs.

So here goes ...

When installing the oil cooler on a 2.0 liter engine, where do the
'thickish' washers go? Under the nuts ... or between the cooler and the
crankcase?

I could have sworn when I tore it down they were under the nuts - along with
the thin spring washers. And yet Haynes says - 'don't forget the washers
between the cooler and case'. No mention of this in Bentley.

Perhaps the P.O. put them in the wrong place?

Thanks in advance!
