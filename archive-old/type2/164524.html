Subject: RE: [T2] Need a '79 head in WA

Check with Bus-Boys, Busco or BustedBus. I gave a full '79 to BustedBus a
couple of weeks ago, so I KNOW he has a matched set.

Subject: [T2] Need a '79 head in WA

It looks like I'm going to need a budget (used) head for my '79 (GE) 
2.0 aircooled engine. My &quot;spare&quot; head has a different exhaust, it 
sits farther down 'in' the head and it's oval, won't fit.
Here is a photo of the exhaust (on the head) I have to replace.

I did take a look at what BusDepot had to offer &amp; it's an unknown 
amount of time (it's not a stocked item). At least they have some 
reference to the AC head on line and they indicate that it's also 
used for the AC Vanagon.

I'm going to do some calling tomorrow and see about getting this head 
repaired or a used one from somewhere in this area (Olympia or 
Seattle to Portland) and thought it was worth asking the list. Maybe 
someone has one they can sell?
I'm on as budget so a good used works for me &amp; I won't be paid until 
next Friday so I have a bit of time.
P-mail me if you have one.
Thanks,

Rob
