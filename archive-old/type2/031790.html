Subject: Re: [T2] (was)Re: [T2] continually tight valves; now: Two tdc's per

to add to the following description.

remember the crankshaft controls the pistons,  up and down
but the camshaft controls the valves  open and close

the crankshaft is geared to the cam shaft at a 2:1 ratio thus the crank
goes around twice for each time the cam rotates

&gt; Wink, others:
&gt; I often wonder if the valve adjustment procedure IS understood by all who
&gt; attempt it.
&gt; (And I'm sure it is NOT, judging from what some people have written.)
&gt; Understand that each cylinder has TWO TDC's per cycle! That is, it takes TWO
&gt; complete revolutions to complete a cycle in a four-stroke cycle engine. (720
&gt; degrees)
&gt; When you want to adjust the valves the engine MUST be at IGNITION TDC for that
&gt; cylinder. In other words, at the end of the compression- beginning of the power
&gt; strokes.
&gt; The other TDC is at the end of the exhaust- beginning  of the intake strokes.
&gt; Are we all together on this?
&gt; Any questions? Class?

&gt; &gt; Background info: 1971 westy, 1600dp, I'm sure the valve adjustment procedure
&gt; &gt; is correct (TDC for each valve)
&gt; &gt; Thanks, wink
