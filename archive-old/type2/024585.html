X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I found a good tach in a Porsche 924, they are a 4 cyl and the tach is made
by VDO. The lens on it looks like a big tit, so I pulled the glass out of an
old Bus speedo and swaped it in. It is the same size as a Bus speedo, so you
have to get creative on mouning. I'd tell you what I did with mine, but its
in my Super Beetle right now, not my Bus.

&gt; hey listees,
&gt; I need some VDO guages and am on a budget, so if anyone either has the

&gt; looking for oil temp, oil press, possibly cylinder head temp, and
&gt; possibly a tach. Thanks

Go to a junkyard and scrounge around in the 80's rabbits, jettas, audi's
etc.

a lot of those cars came with VDO gagues (many calibrated for metric
though, degrees celsius, bar, etc VS psi degrees fareheit..)

Cheap and good... standard size, standard mounting configuration.

Never seen a tach like that though... but i guess if you found an
instrument cluster from a 4 cyl VW you could cut the tach out and make it
fit in a bay cluster...

take care,

Steve
