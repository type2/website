Subject: Re-torquing rear axle nut

There's a tool for removing (and presumably re-installing) that honkin 
big nut on the rear wheel that is about 1/2&quot; thick, and about 8&quot; long, 
which allows you to hammer like h*ll on it to get the nut off...

My question is, how do you know how to re-torque the sucker when you are 
putting it back on?  Hammering the h*ll out of it doesn't show up in any 
of my manuals as a torque setting.
