Subject: Re: [T2] Being sued by VWoA, what to do?

Brian,

Where will it all end!

Depends on how you used the name IMHO.  The hubcaps were probably genuine 
vw from old cars...yes?  So it's not like you made the hubcaps with the vw 
emblem and tried to pass them off as genuine.

Better get a lawyer though.

This is the first instance of someone like you being sued by VWOA although 
there has been a lot of discussion on this on the vintagvw list.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey all, well after we got back from the Campbelltown show today, there
&gt; was a letter in the mailbox from an attorney in Indy.  First off, about
&gt; 2 years ago, I had made a clock out of an old vw hubcap of mine,
&gt; drilling a hole in the center of the cap, and buying a clock movement
&gt; from the craft store, and I had gave this as a gift to a friend of mine
&gt; for christmas. After i knew it was a hit as a gift, I had tried to sell
&gt; a few from our web page here on webtv. we might have sold one or two,
&gt; and traded a few for live music. Now this letter states we will need to
&gt; pay them $3000 by May 15th for damages of using the VW name without
&gt; authorization. And if we dont get that to them by that date, they can
&gt; sue us for up to 3x that amount. Which is absolutely absurd. The reason
&gt; I am bringing this to the lists attention is if I remember correctly,
&gt; some time ago someone else was being sued or something to that affect.
&gt; If anyone can help us out, we would totally appreciate it. After all,
&gt; isnt all that stuff we sell at the swaps unauthorized? Thanks for your
&gt; time...Brian
