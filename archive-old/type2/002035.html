Subject: New Steering Wheel

If anyone is interested in replacing their old cracked bus steering wheel,
as I was, I just installed a new Brazilian Wolfsburg Steering wheel on my 70
bus. The wheel cost me only $29, plus $20 or so for the adapter. It looks
great, and steering is no problem at all, even though it is much smaller. If
anyone wants to see what it looks like, I can e-mail you a picture of it.
