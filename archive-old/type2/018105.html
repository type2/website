On monday I called Ron, told him I was moving to California in a week,
he had the parts I needed in stock, I had them shipped UPS 2nd day and
my friendly UPS driver was at my door bright and early Wednesday morning
with my parts.  Ron has also taken time to talk with me and help me sort
out some things, when I know he is crazy-busy! What is also nice is he
has all my info on file, so the order taking process is quick and easy
(once I have asked him my hundredth question:) Thanks Ron you have my
business,
Scoob
