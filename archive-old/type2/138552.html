Subject: '50s Bus needed for commercial

Good Volks -

The subject says it all. My neighbor is a propmaster looking for a '50s 
Splittie - not white. He'll be shooting a 1-day shoot in San Francisco &quot;week 
after next&quot; (12/19 - 12/23), but he doesn't know the exact date yet. I 
didn't ask how much the company pays to rent a bus for a day, but last time 
I was in the hunt, I believe it was $300 or $400/day. Not bad.

It doesn't have to be cherry! It must run, and will have a short drive in 
the commercial.

Here's his info - please contact him:

Let's get one of ours in a mainstream commercial!

Thanks -
