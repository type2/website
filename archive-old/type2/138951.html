&gt; The rationale behind the WR 1 is straightforward. It is not &quot;another&quot;
&gt; solenoid, it's a relay. Its purpose is to reduce the resistance in
&gt; wiring between the battery and the starter. This is ohm's law, which
&gt; last time I looked was good science.

The wiring between the starter and solenoid and the battery is as short as
it was before the WR-1 install.

The relay, greatly shortens the length of wire that powers terminal 50 on
the solenoid by about 10 ft. as well as divert the current that powers the
solenoid bypassing the high resistance of the ignition switch and it's
wiring.
