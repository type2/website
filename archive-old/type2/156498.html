Subject: cargo door

Well, the new 2.0 was the good news.  Bad news, I crashed my cargo  door into a barrier today.  Long story, but I was trying to  maneuver around a stupid gate in a hospital parking lot and didn't see  it as I was sitting up too high.  I'm going to have to take the  one off of my donor bus.  It's a '71 or '72.  Same door,  right?? 
  
  I finally found a bus with the original spring set up.  It was  sitting down at Lockhart's and as soon as I turned the handle, it  sprang right out.  I want that!  Mine has always been a  pain.  Anybody know where I can get an original spring.  I'm  sure it's NLA as BD and others don't list it.  Is there something  generic that I can fashion?  
  
  Rolling resto is coming along nicely.  I LOVE that POR-15.   What a snap.  I'm using more than I expected, though.  Heck,  I may just do the whole bus in the stuff.  When I get it sanded  down, a buddy of mine is going to spray it for me.  He does great  work.  
  
  How hard are the windows to pop out?  The new cargo door has  sliding windows so I'll have to take my Jalousie out and switch  them.  And the guy (John Tracy, great guy!) is giving me a new  windshield he has in his garage.  So I'll pull the old one, fix  the rust, and pay $75 to have a windshield shop install it.  I  know I'd break it after reading the horror stories here.   Thoughts???   
  
  Thanks...KR
