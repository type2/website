Subject: Re: [T2] Metric or NPT was VDO oil Pressuse adapter question 

&gt; So now I am beginning to wonder... Is this mysterious little hole standard
&gt; NPT thread or is it straight 10 X 1 metric??? If its just NPT I can make an
&gt; adapter out of stuff I have no sweat. I was under the impression that it
&gt; was metric...

It's NPT.
I don't recall if it's 1/4&quot; or 3/8&quot; offhand.
I haven't looked at it for a while.
