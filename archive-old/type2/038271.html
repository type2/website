Subject: Couple 'O Questions

Hi Folks. Very sorry that I won't be able to meet up with some of you folks 
that I've talked to on the list at EveryBus...Was going to try and get there, 
and I live fairly close, but my Much Better Half is eight months 
pregnant(which I guess would actually make her my better 3/4) and just can't 
handle the prospect of not being Very close to a bathroom, and her OB! But 
hey, there is always next year. My question has to do with the word 
&quot;Westfakia&quot;. I've seen it used several times, and always made the assumption 
that the folks were talking about a home-made camper conversion, along 
Westfalia lines. Am I correct, or just dense?
Thanks, and can't wait to hear those Everybus trip reports!
Parker
