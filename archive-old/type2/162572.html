&gt; I need to replace a Fuel Injector in my Bus. It has a

&gt; easy. But I do have a question. Do I need to have the
&gt; gas tank empty or near empty to do this??? Will
&gt; gasoline come poring out when I remove the old
&gt; Injector if I have a full tank of gas? I'd rather ask
&gt; than find out the hard way.

it probably will come out. I have valves in my fuel line and always shut
em off before working on the line, but #1 &amp; 2 ring is right there and
needs to come ooff  if your fuel presure switch is less than perfect you
will get it all coming thru
