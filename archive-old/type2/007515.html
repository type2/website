&gt; There's been some discussion about roof-mounted a/c systems, and an
&gt; assumption that these are mains powered for parked motorhomes.
&gt; 
&gt; There is another kind of roof-mounted a/c system, here in Australia.
 It is
&gt; 12v powered, and I have seen it on top of various buses.  I'm told
that
&gt; it's evaporative, not refridgerated, and thus for some reason is more
&gt; useful in our tropical areas.  I seem to recall that when I once
enquired
&gt; about the cost, it was well over AUD$2,000 (about USD$1,100?).

We have them here in the US as well.  I had one (not on my bus) made
by the &quot;PlaCool&quot; company.  It fit in a 14 inch square hole (standard
US RV vent hole)  It worked, after a fashion, but it was a real piece
of junk.  Everything was made of the cheapest plastic possible.  The
plastic top sun-rotted in two years.  Parts were expensive.

There are other manufacturers out there, but I don't know of their
quality.  I figured it was easier to just squirt myself with a spray
bottle and get the same effect.
