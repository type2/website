 I think you may just have the piston cocked in the bore, if it was me I
would try to recenter it by 'carefully' applying pedal pressure, I say
carefully because there's nothing to keep the piston from popping out now
that you've pulled the rotor. Like others have suggested, look around and
see how parts look, you might want to replace seals while your there. If
your objective was to just drain the swamp and forget about the gators- then
recenter the piston, get a big ass c-clamp 8&quot; or bigger, find a piece of
scrap to protect the piston, pull the cap to relieve pressure, make sure the
clamp is centered on the piston so you dont cock it again and tighten that
sucker down, you might be surprized at the force needed to retract the
piston. Thats my answer and Im stickin to it, ymmv

&gt; Thanks, I really would appreciate it.  I got the other side of the brake
&gt; pads changed with no problems.  I think I made the problem worse on the
&gt; side I hadn't finished though.  Now the piston is about an eighth of an
&gt; inch or so from the from the rotor disk and I can't get it to budge.

&gt; &gt; What is the name of the right tool so I can see about buying it?

&gt; &gt; can also get a large C clamp in there useing the old pad to keep from
&gt; &gt; scatching the piston or can also break down and get the right tool
&gt; from
&gt; &gt; sears or harbor frt. ; )

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Don't bother with the bleeder bolt - I wedge the caliper piston back
&gt; &gt; by
&gt; &gt; &gt; prying between the rotor disk and the piston.  I cut a piece of 2x4
&gt; &gt; into a
&gt; &gt; &gt; wedge shape (chop saw) so I can wedge it between the opposite
&gt; &gt; piston/rotor
&gt; &gt; &gt; space, to prevent a possibility of warping the rotor disk.  Then
&gt; wedge
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; piston in with a &quot;pickle fork&quot; or tie rod separator or a small pry
&gt; bar
&gt; &gt; &gt; levered against the rotor with a piece of leather or such to prevent
&gt; &gt; &gt; scratching the disk.  I think I've done it with another piecer of
&gt; 2x4
&gt; &gt; &gt; thinned at the end to get in there and wedge back the piston.  You
&gt; &gt; need
&gt; &gt; &gt; about a foot or more of leverage.  Make sure you didn't just top up
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; fluid resorvoir, or it will go above the vent hole and soak the
&gt; &gt; surrounding
&gt; &gt; &gt; body.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I can't get the &quot;I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't know what it is called&quot; to compress.  Does anyone have any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggestions as to what I can do to get this job done Thanks for
&gt; your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time.
