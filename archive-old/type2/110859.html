Does your 74 have a solid partition or does it have the walkthrough-type
split partition with a bench seat across it?  I've only seen 72 and back
nonwalkthroughs, though...

All of the non-panel non-walkthrough's I've seen (2 so-69 campers, 1
ratty-remains of a so-68 camper, 1 9 passenger) had the split partition.
All of the panel's (and double cabs) have had full partitions.
