Older carburated engines can do quite well on emissions tests if they are
correctly tuned.  I don't have any VW figures, but my '74 Chevy 454 with
_no_ smog equipment has figures of 12ppm HC, where the limit is 450ppm.

The problem is that open loop carburated engines tend to get dirtier as
they get out of tune.  Modern EFI closed loop engines tune themselves
continuously as they analyze their own exhaust.

this technology is not magic, and can be applied to any vehicle regardless
of age.  Unfortunately, in California at least, this is virtually
impossible as you have to jump through several expensive administrative
hoops to run any non-stock systems on your engine.

Obviously, they don't want us to improve our existing vehicles.  It's much
better for the state if we buy new vehicles.
