&gt;Hello listmembers,
&gt;
&gt;What are my main concerns with buying a bus that has been sitting for this 
&gt;long?

The fuel turns to rot and gums up the fuel injection system. The brake
fluid turns to rot and gums up the clutch and brake hydrolics. Seals in the
motor and drivetrain can take a set and start leaking soon after reuse.
Sometimes they stop, sometimes not. 

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Im driving up there on saturday morning to take a look at it, anything I 
&gt;should check while im there that a tire-kickin wouldn't tell me?

Drain the fuel tank, blow out the fuel lines, change the fuel filter,
refill with fuel.

Fire it up to create a vacuum for the brake booster. Stand on the brake
pedal as hard as you can, them inspect for leaks at the calipers and
cylinders. Actuate the clutch about 50 times and check those cylinders for
leaks. If the fluid is black, know that flushing out the dirty fluid with
new can dissolve the gum and varnish and within a week or two the leaks
will start.
