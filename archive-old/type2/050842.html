Subject: [T2] RE: soaked at the garage

I'm not sure your were soaked. Regarding the $85 charge, and $50 for
diagnosis.
This was a somewhat non obvious problem (as you noticed;-), and if it took
the guy 
almost an hour to figure out what was wrong (starting from square one), then
at $60/hr
it cost $50 to diagnose the problem. 15 minutes to fix, and 10 for moving
vehicles, paperwork.
Bingo! $85.

There is the old joke about the customer  that was upset for a $50 bill when
a guy came in looked,
at a machine, and turned one screw a quarter turn. &quot;$50 to turn one screw?&quot;
the customer raved 
The repairman took  the bill back, and issued the following bill

Turning one Screw                         $1.00
Knowing which screw to turn         $49.00
TOTAL                                        $50.00

My dad used to buy cars local garages and dealerships couldn't fix. Got them
real cheap, especially after the
2nd or third place gave up. Nine time out of ten he had them running within
an hour, because he knew what they were 
missing. He'd sell them at a good profit. He wasn't selling labor, he was
selling knowledge!
Of course every once in a while he was wrong, and it would take him a week
to get one going. Then he was selling labor;-(
