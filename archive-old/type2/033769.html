&gt;&gt; So you are saying we can use a wider plug gap and get a better burn
&gt;&gt; if
&gt;&gt; we use one of those high output coils?
&gt;
&gt;Yes, but the points and condenser will have to handle the increased
&gt;current flow to the coil.  Nothing comes for free! :)

No kidding - about free. I used an MSD Blaster 2 coil for a short period of
time. Wider gap and everything. Ran fine for about one minute then burned
the points up and melted the cam foot. Tried a different set of points that
had that phenolic foot it ran for about two mintutes before the points
turned white. Electronic ignition is the way to go. No problems, great burn.
