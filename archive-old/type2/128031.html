mike that is what i ordered for mine and will or suppose to be here tomorrow....
from what i understand they are to be good carbs,....(for the price) but have crappy linkage.. someone that has them i know has replaced the linkage on thees with a SCAT linkage but i havent heard back or checked back in yet  with there results on the SCAT linkage on them....been plain busy hehehehehe me that is.....
just my 2 cents and not experience...
