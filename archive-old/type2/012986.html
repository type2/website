Brian,

This reply comes via a little handheld thing and quoted text is a hoop-jump. Forgive me, Listfolk.

Also, the little advert at the tail is not my doing. It's added by the system. I have complained to no avail. Please ignore it.

I have been running a second battery for several months now and live full-time in my bus at State Parks, National Forests, Corps of Engineer parks, friends driveways and the like. I prefer no hook-ups but will grab electric if the air I breathe drops below 50 degrees.

My batteries are in parallel, both legs fused at 30 amps. A small relay was concocted to hook 'em together and the low-voltage relay line was run up to the rear defrost knob; pull knob out, lights green, batteries connected.

With that arrangement, the aux batt will drain the main batt but alternator charges both. I try not to let aux batt drop below 11.5V which is really too low for good batt health, but what's a cheapskate to do?

I'll tell you one thing to do. Deep Cycle is the *right* way to go, but there's another way.

Go to Wally World and pay $60 for their (yellow) Maxx. It's a charge-quick top-of the Wally line. Comes with a 3-year free replacement and a 9-year pro-rate! Wally World is everywhere even in small-town USA. When it dies, you know where to go and what to do.

Get a good alternator. Heat kills alternators.

Eventually, you may fall asleep with a VCR running or something and wake-up with a dead aux. I always start the bus before pulling the batts together for that reason.

So far, so good. If you need/want info on the relay and schematic, please holler.

HTH
