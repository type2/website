Subject: wooh! Accelerator cable snap

My accelerator cable broke (I'm guessing, it's not attached to the throttle and 
I don't see it when the pedal is moved around) coming home from school today, so
I'm going to attempt to replace it myself this weekend.  If anyone has done 
this and has any gotchas gimme a p-mail!

Thanks,
