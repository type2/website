Subject: electric fuel pump relay

Where does everyone with electric fuel pump have their relays installed?
Mine's screwed onto a piece of plywood which is then screwed through the
&quot;floor&quot; of the engine compartment, and it's right in the middle of the
way of getting the battery out. Is there a better place to put this
thing?
