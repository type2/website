Subject: the little brake drum that wouldn't--SUCCESS

PROCEDURE FOR REMOVING %&amp;*#_at_ STUCK BRAKE DRUM

Condition:  Rear %&amp;*#_at_ brake drum won't come off 'cuz the brake shoes are
rusted to 
the brake drum.  Axle removes easily.

Tools and Materials:  Phase II tool kit, WD-40, liquid wrench, 3# single
jack hammer, 
impact wrench, 46mm socket, cordless trouble light, hydraulic floor jack,
jack stand, 
thermarest mattress, and three glasses of beer.

Remarks:  You can't move the bus to get to the front axle 'cuz one rear
wheel won't turn.  
You are leaving on a long road trip in less than a month and have to replace
all of the ball 
joints, tie rod ends, brake components, etc.

Step 1.     Squirt half a can of WD-40 in through the lug bolt holes and
brake adjustment 
          hole (which is at the top of the backing plate where it is useless
for backing off the star 
          nuts).

Step 2.     Bang on the sucker with the 3# hammer.

Step 3.     Bang some more.

Step 4.     Remove the tire and road wheel, bang on the sides of the drum,
bang on the 
          rear of the drum (front is front).  Drink a glass of beer.  Send
pleading E-Mail to 
          type2 list.

Step 5.     Next day, put impact wrench on the 46mm nut, leave cotter pin
in.  Hammer 
           away on the nut in both directions.  Bang some more with the 3#
hammer.

Step 6.     Remove cotter pin, remove 46mm nut with impact wrench, hammer
out axle 
          with 3# hammer.  Drink a glass of beer.

Step 7.     Read speedy replies (thanks!!) from on-line VW gurus, consider
options, gain 
          encouragement.

Step 8.     Next day, go out and bang some more.  Put tire and road wheel
back on.  Bang 
         on lug nuts around clockwise  (very important).  Turn wheel 1/8
inch--HOORAY.  Bang 
         on lug nuts around clockwise.  Turn wheel another 1/8 inch.  Repeat
until brake drum is 
         rotated 180 degrees.  

Step 9.    Liberally squirt liquid wrench onto brake adjusting stars.  Drink
a glass of beer.  
          Prime newly make paneling for Westy innards.  Back off adjusting
stars and remove brake 
          drum, road wheel, and tire assembly.


My thanks to Webby, Saintly, VW Gurus!

.....be on the road in no time.
