Subject: Engine options: New Block, New Turn Key Engine, Get a Rebuild

I have a '77 Camper and a 1600 engine in it that a PO put in while in=20
Mexico, that just won't go anywhere that looks like a hill or a bump=20
for that matter. It doesn't have heater boxes. It has a brand new  carb 

and distributor.

I don't have a garage and this is my daily driver, but I could=20
carpool/bus (not the VW kind) for a week or two no biggie.

What's my best option as far as getting a bigger engine put in. I am=20
looking at my options and as far as I see I can:=20

a&gt; Get a new 2.0L block and build up from there. This sounds expensive=20
and prohibitive given I have no garage and I won't be able to salvage=20
much off my 1600 and I'm a newbie mechanic.=20

b&gt; Buy a brand new turnkey engine from one of those places like GEX.=20
This would be around $3000 plus having it put in if I don't do it=20
myself. I'd probably be able to get $300-$400 for my 1600. This sounds=20
easy, but seems like a cop-out.=20
Issue: I'd still have to get the heater boxes $400-$500 new.=20

c&gt; Buy a complete 2.0L with everything, heater boxes, etc. from a junk=20
yard and rebuild/have it rebuilt. I was told around $1000 would be a=20
good price for the engine and then add on after that.=20
Issue: I don't know what a good looking engine looks like, I have no=20
place to put an engine and I'm a newbie mechanic.=20

I'd really appreciate some feedback on this. The mayonnaise jar buried=20
in the back yard is getting full and I need to make some decisions=20
about this so I can start enjoying my camper more instead of thinking,=20
one-day I'll go up a freeway rise at 50 instead of 35-40.

Thanks in advance!
