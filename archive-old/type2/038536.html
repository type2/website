Lets see... dull, flakey white, with fiberglass threads showing... Oh, sorry, 
thqt's what it looks like, now.

If I remember right, the tops were like a satiny white - not flat, not 
glossy.  I think were I to redo mine (soon!!), I will probably go with the 
flat over the gloss, only out of personal preference.  Then again, I'd like 
to find a darker (than the stock yellowish) canvas with the 3 windows (like I 
saw on this one really cool westy).  Something where if I want it dark (for 
day sleeping) I can get it, but where I can open it up on a warm night.  Do I 
want it all? &lt;grin&gt;
