Double check that you have disconnected:

The throttle cable
The heat exchanger cables (2)
The fuel line
ALL 4 bolts that connect the trans to the block
All wiring

Anyone think of anything else?

You might have to give it a brisk pull to get it off the shaft.  Be sure the
trans has something to support it like a piece of 2x4.

Hey Volks,

I'm in the middle of my first engine pull and have run into a little 
obstacle. I have the engine and trans almost seperated( I can see the 
flywheel)but can't seem to get it to move the last few inches so I can lower

it. There is about 1&quot; between the rear apron and the oil filler tube and I 
didn't think I had to remove the tube from the sump, but I'm not sure there 
is gonna be enough room. Anyone have an tricks for getting them seperated???

I keep pulling on the case but it seems like It won't move any further. 
There isn't anything holding it back, just the trans shaft I think.

Thanks,
