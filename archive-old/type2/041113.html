&gt; Regarding the Type 2, Type 4 question. It gets more complicated if your van
&gt; has
&gt; the cold fusion option from the Type 7 engine. This consists of Palladium
&gt; plated pistons, and a heavy water
&gt; injection system. This adds about 25 horsepower. Looking at the heavy water
&gt; consumption
&gt; on my van to date, I figure I'll get about 125,000 miles out of the quart my
&gt; brother in-law got me
&gt; (he works at a nuclear power plant) which would equate to 500,000 miles per
&gt; gallon.
&gt; Note: This option would not be practical in California because your Helium
&gt; emissions
&gt; would be too high to pass the smog test. Also the neutron emissions seem to
&gt; be discoloring the 
&gt; paint on my engine lid, and the bottom of the back hatch.
