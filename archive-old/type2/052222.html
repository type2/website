Subject: [T2] 3 passenger front seat for Vanagon

&gt;Many years ago I owned a 70 type 2 with an interesting option.
&gt;It was originally a 7 seater, with 2 buckets in front and a walkthru
&gt;in between. Well this one had  conversion brackets that allowed
&gt;a 2 person seat to be fitted in the center and right positions, thus
&gt;making it an 8 seater.

Yes, I know what you mean. My '69 'Clipper' has that too!

What I'd really like to find is such a conversion for a Vanagon. It's
probably a long shot, more likely possibly from Canada or Europe where
the commercials are sold.

AFAIK and from owning several Vanagons that does not exist as such. Most
commercial Vanagons do have a wide front bench but it requires the full
width partition. So if you want to weld it shut you can have the bench.
