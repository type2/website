Subject: Plug Wires

A year or two ago I decided to redo the plugwires on
the 74 Westie.

I couldn't find the 'correct' wires so I bought a Accel
performance kit which had the correct tops for the
plugs to fit through the tin (etc), transferred the rubber
plug round things (to keep the air where it should)
and made a set.

What I am asking is this. Was this a bad mechanical
thing to do? Are there supposed to be certain resistances
of wire and stuff that I circumvented?

Should I order the right set? (why?)

The bus seems to be running good but you often
can't detect variances. Just want to be sure
