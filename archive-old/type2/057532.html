Subject: Infinitely Wise VW Engineers?? 

Here's a question for those who believe that the VW engineers
designed everything the best possible way, and it shouldn't be changed.
    Take a look at the exhaust on a Type I engine. You have the front
exhaust header tube of almost 2 feet in length, and the rear header only
a few inches in length. Anyone who knows anything about exhausts knows
that this causes significant power differences in those two cylinders,
thereby creating an unbalanced running condition. Furthermore, it
creates a much different temperature difference for those two cylinders,
thereby decreasing engine life.
    The Type IV engine has the same problem but to a much lesser extent.
Does anyone really believe that this was done because it was the &quot;best
possible design&quot;? Or was it done because it was the cheapest way to do
it, and efficiency be damned? 
    And how about that oil cooler sticking up in the fan housing on the
T-1, blocking cooling air to #3 cylinder? Good design, eh? Oh yes,
wonderful!
    And the lack of an oil filter on the T-1? It really isn't needed,
right? They probably just stuck one on the T-4 for cosmetics? How about
those solid lifters? Why they heck did they go to hydraulics -- just to
be like the big boys? 
    For that matter, why did they start putting waterboxers in vans? The
air-cooled engines were so wonderfully designed, nothing could be
improved on them anymore and all those VW engineers were afraid of being
put out of work, right?
     The fact is, VW, just like every other manufacturer, balances the
efficiency of the design against the checkbook. State-of-the-art
engineering doesn't sell cars to Joe Lunchbox, who wouldn't ususally
know the differnce anyway. Price sells. Get the thing out the door as
cheaply as possible. 
      All motor vehicles can be improved upon.
