Subject: messed up brakes

Hi all.  I think I messed up my brakes.  Here's the situation:

My bus is not a daily driver.  Usually I drive it to the gym (which 
means it's not driven nearly as much as it should be!) which is 3-4 
times a week.

But... I got lazy during the last few weeks of calendar parking (have to 
park on alternate sides of the street each night) so I parked the bus in 
the backyard on a slight incline.  I engaged the parking brake, and it 
was parked like that for about two weeks.  (Don't worry - I was driving 
the other car to the gym!!!)

A few days ago, my partner was out in our other car and I had to go to 
the hardware store, so I drove the bus.  Ack!  When I disengaged the 
parking brake handle, it seems like the cable stuck - only it isn't 
really braking the wheels.

In other words, the brake pedal goes about half way down before actually 
starting to brake.  Then, if I am braking any harder than very 
slowly/gently, the 'B' light on the dash comes on.  It was my 
understanding that the 'B' light was supposed to come on whenever the 
emergency brake was engaged, but that mine was broken because it wasn't 
working like that.  :)

Now I don't really know what's going on.  I don't think, but am no 150% 
positive, that the hand brake cable is _always_ engaged even though the 
handle is pushed in.  It doesn't feel like I'm driving with the brakes 
on (or even some of them).  It does, however, feel like I'm driving 
_without_ some of the brakes.

Any ideas?  I'm anticipating some &quot;go under here and jiggle this&quot; kinds 
of answers.
