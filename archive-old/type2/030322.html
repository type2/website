&gt; &gt; the real usfullness of the flaps is to help the anemic heating system in
&gt; &gt; cold weather, without the flaps there would never be any heat, such that
&gt; &gt; it is.   
&gt; 
&gt; Also, the flaps act as air vanes to help direct the flow of air after it
&gt; exits the fan shroud AND to help maintain laminar flow.  Turbulent flow
&gt; requies as much as 4 times the power to move the same volume of air.

I'll buy the &quot;direct the flow of air&quot;, but &quot;laminar flow?&quot;  After the air
leaves the fan it's pretty darn turbulent!  When pursueing laminer flow on
airplane wings, aircraft builders even smooth down paint stripes near the
leading edges of the wings, so the flow remains attached.  The inside of a
fan housing is hardly up to those finish standards!
