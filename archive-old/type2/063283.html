&gt;&gt;For info on parts, try Ark Mirvis,  at AUTO HEATER TECHNOLOGIES, 31 Byram
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;old heaters.  As I recall, he's reluctant to sell parts  (personally told
&gt;&gt;me he feels that they are too dangerous for average person to fool with,
&gt;&gt;and doesn't want to feel responsible if it blows up),

&gt;From the vanagon_at_lenti days, I remember a couple of posts about how Ark
Marvis promised some stuff, was paid, and delivered nothing. Seem to recall
someone claiming to loose ~$200 this way. I don't know. I've never had any
dealings with him, but I've seen several posts warning that he is a
less-than-desirable business partner.

Like I said, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING FOR SURE. I'VE NEVER DEALT WITH HIM.

Add to this any other disclaimers you see in .sig's.

Thanks! Joe
