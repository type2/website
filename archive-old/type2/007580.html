         Reply to:   RE: Installing a stereo, without damaging the van.
My '77 Bus came with two nice 6x9 ovals set low on the front doors near the step plates. They have pretty heavy plastic grilles on them so your feet don't damage the speakers and they sound pretty good. The PO also installed some pretty strange speakers that are like little 5&quot; balls; one on each side of the rear overhead compartment door. They don't sound that great, but it's nice to get sound in the back of your bus!

Does anybody have any clever suggestions for speaker placement?
