&gt; i was wondering if anyone knew the front to rear weight distribution of a
&gt; bay window?  often on the vanagon list the discussion arises that the
&gt; vanagon has pretty close to a 50-50 front to rear weight distribution and
&gt; that fact causes poor wet and snow driving performance.  it is often said
&gt; that bay window vans perform much better because of their rearward weight
&gt; bias.  so i have been wondering what the bay windows weight distribution
&gt; is.

I weighed the bus on the scale at a metal scrapyard once. The bus weighed in
at 3500 lbs (w/two spare tires and me on board).

Front axle was 1640 lbs.
Rear axle was 1860 lbs.

That's 47/53 with driver on board.
