Subject: Propane tank question, Will this work?????????

Hello List,

I have a refrigator unit from an early 80's Vanagon
that I am going to install in my 74 bus. I currently
do not have a propane tank. I know that the bus and
Vanagon propane tanks are 3 gal tanks. I found a
propane tank from a 66 VW Bus that is 3.2 gal. Is
there any reason that I can't use this tank to power
my fridge and stove? Here is a pic of it.

I hope that link is good. Is it still legal to use
this tank? Will I run into any problems? Any thoughts?

I just want to make sure that I make a good
investment. Thank you and have a great day!

Regards,

David Kelly
