&gt; very long time. Grab a seat and listen to this

I know how you feel. Back in June 2002 I had a similar experience...

When I was still living in Austin I visited Speedy Align on Burnet to have a
wheel alignment performed. I asked if they would have any difficulty with an
old VW and I was told &quot;no problem&quot;. I even got a recommendation from several
beetle owners before I went.

The wheel alignment was completed quickly, although I was disappointed that
no printout was provided. The manager said the rear end camber was off spec
but he didn9t have the tools to adjust it. Since I knew the procedure from
reading the Bentley I let it go but got nowhere when I asked them to reduce
the price when I was charged for a 4-wheel alignment and only got 2 wheels
done. &quot;Apparently&quot; there was no 2-wheel price.

When the front wheel alignment was complete, I was told the steering wheel
would be off-center because only one tie-rod was adjustable. I knew the
factory configuration was one non-adjustable tie-rod, one adjustable tie-rod
and an adjustable drag-link that connects the tie-rods at the relay arm to
the pitman arm of the steering box. They said even if they could adjust it,
because of unknown changes in the front-end geometry, such as an accident,
aligning the wheels would off-set the steering wheel. I9ve owned this
vehicle since 1980 and it has never been in an accident and the factory
didn't have any trouble lining up the steering wheel.

I went home taking the explanation of the manager and technician as BS but I
decided to consult the Bentley and Steve Dolan who explained that simple
adjustments to center the steering wheel are indeed possible after a wheel
alignment.

Not wanting to go back I went to Autozone to rent a tool to pop out the drag
link. After a couple hours of futility renting every style of puller I had
to give up and go back to the alignment shop.

I returned the next morning and tried to explain the situation to the tech
and he told me again that the non-adjustable tie-rod was the problem.  I
maintained that it came from the factory like this and that it was
adjustable but he refused to listen, blew me off and said I should see the
manager in the afternoon.

I returned later in the afternoon and explained the issue to the manager and
received the same excuses and more: tie-rods were not adjustable, front-end
out of whack, replacement tie-rods different length than the originals, etc.

Beyond my assessment that the work was left incomplete from the day before,
I didn9t enjoy driving with the wheel off-center and the turn signals no
longer auto-cancelled after turning a corner. The manager had the gall to
suggest that I visit AutoZone to rent the tools I required to complete the
job.

After hearing about my displeasure with driving and my explanation of how
the steering worked on my vehicle and running them both out of excuses the
manager agreed to look under my vehicle and asked me to drive up on the
service lift. He then cut the cotter pin from the drag-link, unscrewed the
castellated nut from the drag-link and proceeded to vibrate the drag-link
out of the pitman arm with an an air tool before I could stop him. I was
stunned!

After about 10 seconds of ignoring me, the drag link popped out and he bas
said, 3there you go2. I was waiting for him to adjust the steering wheel but
another technician I'd never met before agreed that I should be adjusting
the steering wheel from the cab only and they simply just did what I
requested. I expected them to center the steering box with the wheels
forward and adjust the wheel if necessary but they said they'd have to
charge me to do the work.

Concluding they were total jerks and I better cut my losses, I drove the bus
off the lift and stopped in their parking lot to jack up the front end and
complete the work myself. I couldn't go far because the cotter pin had been
cut off by the manager. I started to jack up the bus when the manager came
back and said they could be sued for any accidents or mishaps on their
property. I said they better find me a cotter pin because if I have an
accident I will be suing them for negligence. They couldn't find one and
insisted I leave by any means including towing the vehicle off the property
at my expense.

I was pretty upset about the experience especially about driving the bus in
this condition but Autozone was only a block away so I took a chance. In
their parking lot I tried to perform the adjustment myself but the press fit
of the drag link made it impossible to remove again so I bought a cotter
pin, drove home and ordered the tie-rod tool. The following week when the
tool arrived I was able to correct the position of the steering wheel
easily.

Lesson #1: avoid small shops like the plague
Lesson #2: the BBB is powerless
Lesson #3: the tie-rod tool is invaluable
Lesson #4: shop recommendations mean squat
