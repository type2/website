&gt; Hey Karl,
&gt; of interest to me (and possibly others) is what exact components you need
and
&gt; from what vans/golfs/etc. will work in the pancake bus??

The harness from a 79 CAL bus is a perfect fit with no mods necessary. The
harness from a 80-83.5 CAL Vanagon will work with a couple of mods: cut the
coil connecter in half [it's part of the EFI harness] and toss the idle
stabilizer [you plug the 2 connecters together just like you were timing a
80-83.5 Cal Vanagon]. There are 2 different styles of the 3 pin connecter
for the distributor, one has 2 guide lugs, the other has 4. Likewise, the
socket on the distributor has to match the connecter you have. The harness
has a plug for the module and a plug for the distributor and 3 loose wires,
+ to coil, - to coil, and ground.

&gt;  Ign. module?

Same as early Rabbit w/electronic ign. or Audi 4 cyl. Make sure it has the
heatsink attached.

&gt; coils?

Any early Rabbit or Audi electronic ign. coil will work. Bentley says &quot;under
no circumstances should a coil other than VW part no. 211 905 115C be used
with the breakerless transisterized system&quot;. At the time Bentley was written
this was the only coil out. It has been subbed repeatedly.

&gt; stuff like that.  and then also where can we find the info on the advance
&gt; curves or is that done from your own research??

The curves are in the 68-79 Bentley. See section 5, pages 77 thru 80 on the
79 up Cal. ignition.

The only thing that stops this from being a simple drop-in swap is the dist.
drive gear. It will be around 3 teeth off and will have to be moved if you
want the rotor to point to the index mark at the top of the base edge.
