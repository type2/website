Subject: Re: Oil Pressure Switch

Thanks to everyone that replied to my post regarding the oil pressure
switch.  I pulled the plug out, and it doesn't look like it's stripped. 
Didn't see any metal shavings so I think all's well.

Here's what pisses me off though.  I guess it's my own stupidity or
something to that degree but get this:

I've had this reoccuring oil leak for the past 2000 miles.  So, I would
be sure to check the oil and fill it up when needed until the next oil
change. (I suspected the oil drain plug)  Then, just recently, 2000
miles later, I realize that my oil switch light has never been lit at
ignition &quot;on,&quot; engine off.  So, I checked everything out and suspected
it was the oil pressure switch.

I bought a new one for 4 bux and went to take the old one out.  THE OLD
ONE WAS LOOSE!!

I put the new one in and yes, the light now comes on.  Get this,
though.  I checked the oil to see what it's at, it read at TWICE the
nominal height?!?!  I don't know how it got that high!  So, does that
mean that I've been driving around with no oil pressure (because the old
switch was loose *and* leaking oil) or does the engine still circulate
oil if it's in the pan?

errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

Mike
