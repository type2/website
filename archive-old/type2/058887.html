Quoth firefly1_at_intop_dot_net:

&gt; Well, after numerous calls and emails, I have been unable to find
&gt; the shift rod boots for my bus.

Bummer, Shawn!  Put me down for two, Jim!  Lessee, that's 9998 more 
to go....  I just sent out an RFQ that included a pair of boots to a 
couple of suppliers and I'll post if any of them turn up.  I'm pretty 
sure Ron _at_ Bus Depot can get the nose bushing and front rod bushing, 
FWIW.

Barring that, what say we chaps use leather gaiters, sewn up with 
wire?
