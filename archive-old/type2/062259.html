craig - there is a good m-code list at the NEATO web page - 
http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/neato.html
I think it is filed under the technical info section.  You could also 
check out Thom Fitzpatrick's barndoor bus page - lots of good info &amp; 
pics.

the list I got from Stiftung AutoMuseum is of course in german and 
not as comprehensive - I could send you a copy - email me your 
address.  Let me know...
Matthew
