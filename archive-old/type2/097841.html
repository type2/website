&lt;&lt; IF concerned with dust getting through, Get Fiberglass air conditioner/
furnace filter (Home Depot- comes as sheets also).  Use this as a liner
beneath a surface grill of your choice- Metal with the interesting
punched patterns like for radiator covers, Burlap, or even colored
needlpoint backing, which is what I used.  The latter is at a typical
fabric/craft store like JoAnn's or So-Fro.  It's a plastic mesh.   Cut
to fit, and tack or staple the edges.  You can add &quot;trim&quot; made from
edgings from the fabric shop or scour a lumber yard to see what trim is
offerred.  If the speaker is mounted behind the hole you cut, the
radiator cover stuff is the most flush- see home depot!
 &gt;&gt;

Ideally, there shouldn't be anything in front of the speakers. That 
said, try and mount the speaker in a &quot;lipped&quot; or &quot;dadoed&quot; hole with 
the face of the speaker flush with the surface. Look at the face of
a home speaker box (without the cover) to get a better idea. The 
space behind the speaker is important, too. A non-resonant &quot;cup&quot;
should seal the back of the speaker, protecting it and in addition,
increasing the efficiency of the speaker.
As for grills, try and avoid metal and plastic, they block the sound
somewhat and might rattle or vibrate. Radio Shack still has &quot;acous-
ticly clear&quot; material (looks like a very open foam) that can be cut
and velcroed over the face of the speaker.
All of this is moot, of course, with a VW engine...
My own &quot;system&quot;? Koss Mini speaker boxes, upgraded with Morel
drivers and a pair of balanced mono amps...
