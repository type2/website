Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 into a 74 bus


Gentleman,

I would like to respectfully disagree on a few points :)

The type 4 motor was designed for and first used in the VW 411 that 
was introduced for the 1968 model year. The high price of the 411 
coupled with its unappealing aesthetics promptly resulted in 
lackluster sales the dogged the 411/412 until the end of its 
production run in 1974. I personally think 411/412 are kinda cool 
but....The motor was also used in the &quot;Porche 914 .&quot; I am not certain 
if the type 4  motor design was influence by the intended use in the 
914

The North American market was hungry for more power. VW did the smart 
thing and put a good motor from a poorly selling vehicle, the 
411/412, into a popular vehicle, the bus/camper, which by American 
standards was underpowered. The results were increased sales figures 
for the Transporter in the US. and an additional motor option for the 
European market. The increased power of the type 4 motor also made an 
automatic transmission a more realistic &quot;fit&quot; in the bus and again 
increasing sales by broadening the market to those who would not or 
could not operate a vehicle with a manual transmission. I have not 
been able to find any evidence that that supports a production 
1600cc/AT bus although in theory using a torque converter from a type 
III could work.

In Europe the Transporter was available with the 1600cc, the type 4 
motor with displacement sizes corresponding with US model years, and 
even a 1200cc option. Vehicle taxes in many European countries was 
based on the displacement of the motor. Taxes on a 2.0 liter were 
roughly 1/3 more than that of a 1600. Many Euro Transporters were in 
fact sold with type 1 motors through 1979 and sold quite well.

Transporters sold with type 4 motors outside North America were not 
fuel injected and for that matter neither were  type 1 motors.  In 
fact there were far less emissions controls on vehicles sold outside 
North America and the little 1600cc motor had a little more to offer. 
Transporters that were factory equipped with 1600cc motors had 
different tranny gearing than the type 4 Transporters sold in the US.

Retrofitting a type 1 motor in a Transporter is certainly possible 
but may not necessarily be practical. There is some special tinware 
that you will need to find a source for or fabricate yourself in 
order the properly seal the engine compartment. A rear correct rear 
hanger bar must be obtained or fabricated to support the motor as was 
done in factory installations of the type1  motor in the 72-79 buses. 
Shortening or swapping of the transmission input shaft may be 
necessary with later transmission. Gearing of 1976 and up NA spec. 
transmission is not an ideal match but will work. The intake manifold 
of the motor must be ready to or altered to provide vacuum for the 
brake booster.  The return port in fuel tank needs to be sealed up. 
There are also some minor electrical housekeeping issues that are 
self evident.

Many times 72 to 79 buses fall on hard times because many air-cooled 
mechanics did not like to work on type 4 motors with its emissions 
controls, fussy dual carbs and later the FI. Most were more than 
happy to work on type 1 motors from the much more common Beetle. It 
could even be argued that the type 4 motor that made the 72 to 79 bus 
sales so incredibly high is what has let so many to rot.

I applaud Jake for his commitment to Type 4 motors, sharing of info 
and advice to the type 2 list and offering a service that keeps buses 
on the road. I have never done business with Jake but may someday. If 
his motor rebuilds are half as good as packing crates I am sold :) 
Seriously, you may not be able to get your local bug racer to do a 
good job servicing or rebuilding your type 4 motor but there are 
folks that can provide the service you need. Using the Internet can 
be as an important a tool as your trusty 13mm combination wrench.

Thanks

&gt;Repair the correct engine and enjoy type 4 power, and reliability. The Main
&gt;reason that VW went to a type 4 was for a more powerful, longer living
