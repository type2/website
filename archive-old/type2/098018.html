Subject: Electronic Ignition- Special condenser?

Hello List,

I am making up a list of odds and ends that I am going
to buy from the Bus Depot to get my engine finished
up. One of the things on my list is the pertronix
electronic ignition settup. My only question is, does
it come with a condenser? If not, is there a special
kind that I need to buy? They varry so much in price,
I just didn't want to purchase the wrong one.Thanks!
