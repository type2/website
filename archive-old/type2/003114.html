Shawn -

I had an interesting symptom just before my (original) tranny went to
heaven. I don't know if this is your problem.

I was backing up one day, and pushed in the clutch to slow down with the
brakes AND MY REAR WHEELS LOCKED SOLID. If it weren't for my fat _at_$$ up
front, I'da done a backwards wheelie. Did my brakes bind solid? Nope. I
tried it again (much slower this time) and sure 'nuf, when I push in the
clutch to free-wheel, my rear end just stopped turning. This happened
sporadically for a few weeks (I didn't want to tell my wife I had to sink
ANOTHER grand into the bus...).

I jacked up the rear end and turned the rear wheels. I could hear a binding
sound inside the tranny, on the driver's side, in front of the CV joint. And
that was that. New tranny time!

I would jack 'er up again, and listen to the tranny whilst turning the
wheels by hand.

Good luck -

Mike

&gt; Is my tranny shot?
