&gt;For converting some of the metric/British units to ours here are some

&gt;kW (kW/hr)        BTU (BTU/hr)     multiply by 3413
&gt;kcal (kcal/hr)    BTU (BTU/hr)     multiply by 0.397

&gt;Pat Walsh replies:

&gt;Thanks for the conversion factors but the kcal/hr still doesn't
&gt;&quot;feel&quot; right.  If we multiply 4000x0.397 we get 1588 BTUs (or is
&gt;it BTU/hr?) which seems AWFULLY low for the max. output of a
&gt;heater.

Excuse the boring units talk, but (from Marks Handbook, 7th ed):

kW-hr to BTU (ENERGY) [or kW to BTU/hr(POWER)] :  multiply by
3412 BTU/kW-hr   The number in Harry's table is correct, the
units are off.

kcal to BTU:  multiply by 3.968 BTU/kcal  The number in the table
is off.  The 4000 kcal/hr heater would be a 16 000 BTU/hr heater.
Sound more real?

I didn't check the other units.
