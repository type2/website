Subject: file pistons

&gt;From: &quot;Thomas J. Tarka&quot; &lt;tommy_at_slackers_dot_net&gt;
&gt;Subject: balancing pistons
&gt;
&gt;when griding down my pistons in the appropriate spots in order balance
&gt;them, can I just use a file?  Or should I be using a file + cutting oil +
&gt;???

ggm replies....
you can just file the pistons and file the rods without any cutting oil

the problem with filing the pistons is that they are made of an aluminum
alloy that is very soft and gummy and the shavings will clog up the teeth in
the file.

there is a special tool that you can use to clean your file. It is called a
&quot;file card&quot;. it looks like a really short haired wire brush. You can use a
ordinary long haired wire brush to clean your file, but the special short
haired file card has really stiff, really thin, really sharp spring steel
hairs that really work well, really

You force the file card against the file really hard and you make strokes
like you are combing the teeth of the file. You move the file card hairs
parallel to the file teeth to drag out the cloging up metal crude. You do not
scrub in every direction like with an ordinary wire brush on a piece of
rusted metal. You make precise movements with the file card. A used file card
works faster than a new file card.

A half round file is real usefull on the rounded edges of the piston skirts.
Be sure to knock off the burr raised by the file. You will always leave a
burr on the edge of metal you are filing. This burr is really sharp, you can
only feel for a burr using calloused finger tips perpendicular to the burr or
else
