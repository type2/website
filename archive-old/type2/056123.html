&gt;
&gt;
&gt;My
&gt;&gt;question, is it reasonable to get off the cylinder shroud without
&gt;pulling
&gt;&gt;the engine to get at these upper nuts.  Has anyone done
&gt;this?

&gt;You know, it might be possible to do this, but why on earth would you
&gt;want to?  It would be SO MUCH easier to just pull the engine!
&gt;Especially since you have the VW with the easiest engine to pull, ever!
&gt;All you do is pull the bumper, remove the rear apron, undo four nuts and
&gt;pull the thing straight back.  Bam, the engine is out!  Why put yourself
&gt;through all the hassle of doing it the hard way when you can save
&gt;yourself some work and swearing by just pulling the engine?
Maybe so, but why do I have such a hard time lifting the motor, lining up
the transmission just so and pushing forward while at the same time pushing
in those rubber supports on the engine brace.  So much back and forth.
Anyhoo, I will yank the motor yet again, torque the cylinder head nuts, snug
all the exhaust connections and hope the ticking goes away.  If not, my
backup 1600sp will go in and I'll look at this motor as a winter project yet
again. (Sigh)  Thanks for all the ideas.
