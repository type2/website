Subject: Dometic Portable Fridge (again)

Well this didn't go out last time, so I'll try again.

Hey thought the list might be interested in this, a guy had one 
at the last Elizabeth Furnace campout and it was pretty much 
slick as anything IMHO, controls like the Vanagon Dometic, but a 
nice chest layout that doesn't lose it's cool when you open it. 
Big enough too, he mentioned having got a good deal around 
$400, here it is for sale $369. Unfortunately his was white/beige 
and now the Peacock Blue seems the only color, sort of foolish 
as it would soak up more sun heat, but you can't have everything 
I guess. Look at it at (bottom of page):

Anyway might prevent some other wayward bay owner from foolishly 
getting rid of his Bus for Vanagon refrigerator envy.
