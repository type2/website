Subject: Upright engine thermostat bracket fitment

I looked in the Bentley Manual for help with adjusting my thermostat 
and flaps (installed about a month ago).  It shows a bracket with a 
slot to enable adjustment up and down on the block.  The bracket I got 
from one of our online vendors does not have this slot.  Instead, I 
&quot;adjusted&quot; the thermostat as much as I could by turning the below up 
onto the connecting rod (until I ran out of threads).  What options do 
I have?  I want to get this right.  According to the Bentley, the 
bellows should snug up to the top of the bracket when the flaps are 
fully open.
