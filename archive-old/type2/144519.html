Subject: more hints about removing rust with Muriatic acid

Please wear safety goggles when using this acid. Additional safety items are
long rubber gloves and rubber boots and old worthless clothes (the acid will
eat holes in your clothes (and skin and eyes).

If you are working in a limestone gravel driveway, you can omit the
expensive baking soda as a neutralizer and instead just rinse the residue
into the gravel. I said RINSE , not splash.  All chemical research buildings
on a campus have a huge gravel pit as a final neutralizer to remove acid
from the waste stream. 

Some of the phosphoric acid based Rust Stop, solutions have paint like
additives that slow down and trap the acid . With these compounds you must
really follow the directions and scrub (wire brush) the surface to remove
all the acid. To make the job easy, let the acid do all the work and space
out several overnight soakings with wire brushing and rinsing with copious
amounts of water. If you don't remove all traces of the acid, the paint will
fail and bubble off. 

Yes you will get flushes of rust on the metal, but the acid rust removal is
really only useful for severe rust that has pitted the metal. For &quot;show&quot;
body panels it is best to sandblast, and sand, and prime, and sand, etc.
