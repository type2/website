&gt; Volks,

&gt; A truly amazing bit of trivia is that if you look under the sink in
your
&gt; hotel room in Paris, home of the metric system, the drain pipe will be an
&gt; inch-sized pipe!  For whatever reason, plumbing is one of those fields
&gt; where inate conservatism has overcome reason.  The drains on Westies are
&gt; inch-sized fittings and you should be able to head down to any plumbing
&gt; supply house and pick up replacement parts, in both the US and in Europe.
&gt; I don't know if this is true in OZ, but I would be willing to bet a beer
&gt; that it is :-)

Well, the system was already established, parts were out there in the
bins, and the pipe sizes were arbitrary anyway, so why change horses in
midstream?  Nobody actually specs a precise fitting size unless they are
designing rocketships, so they just select the next larger standard size
and use it.

If we want to feel fully metricised, we can just assign metric dimensions
to the English-sized pipe, by multiplying the inch size by 25mm.  Hence,
a two-inch fitting becomes a &quot;metric&quot; 50mm fitting with no actual change
in the hardware.
