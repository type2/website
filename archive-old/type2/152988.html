Subject: RE: [T2] &quot;Splittie on Toboggan&quot; Hooded Sweatshirt

Maybe not a splittie on a toboggan - but how about a bus on skis... check
out these cards:

OK, so it's a plug for my wife's cards... but they won't cost you $300
either ;-)

When is the last time you saw a Splittie on a toboggan?

As posted earlier this week, the Buses by the Beach Bus BRR Winter Camp will
be held at Pokagon State Park in Angola, Indiana this
weekend.    Wanted to remind everyone you don't have to attend Bus BRR
to get one of the cool hoodie sweatshirts marking the event.  It features a
Splittie going down a hill on a toboggan and will make you the envy of all
your bus friends when you wear it around the campfire and at an early Spring
bus event!

Check it out here:  http://www.busesbythebeach_dot_com/hoodie.jpg

The Sweatshirt can be ordered at volksfolks_at_busesbythebeach_dot_com.  Cost
is $300,00 and you can use PayPal.   Brien says he has sizes medium
through adult XXL.  As usual, all money goes to the Phoenix Society for Burn
Survivors.
