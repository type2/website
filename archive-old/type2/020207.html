FWIW,
During a long cold winter trip to Seattle one year (I didn't have any heat at
all), I stopped at a MegaMart store and bought a little 12 volt heater that
plugged into the cig lighter.
About 5 miles down the road the bus filled up with smoke and there was melted
plastic and hot wires laying on the floor of my cab.
In the end I found that I had melted the dash around the cig lighter, melted
the wires going to the cig lighter, and melted the plastic heather plug that
was plugged into the cig lighter.
I tossed the heater into the nearest trash and drove the rest of the trip
while inside my sleeping bag.

Years later I now have the stock heater working at about 80% and it's
awesome.  A little more work on the heater system and I'll be rolling down the
windows to cool off a bit.
