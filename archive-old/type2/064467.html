Subject: FS: Split Window Bus Parts '59-'67

I have many parts from past bus projects for sale. Any and all
revenues generated will go towards the restoration of my Ghia
convertible. All the parts are original German, guaranteed good, and
fairly priced. Also, I am happy to ship COD in the continental US.
Please E-mail with your wish list.
TIA,
Josh
