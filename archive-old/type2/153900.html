Subject: Re: [T2] Re-tap a spark plug?

ps:

    Sorry I didn't completely answer your question. I would not let the
spark plug issue stop me from buying if I wanted the van otherwise.
    Using Anti-Size and careful removal and installation of the plugs wont
cause any future problems, or drivability issues. Although it might not be a
bad idea to replace the head on any future tear down, or rebuilds. Error on
the safe side and all.

Howard

&gt;Is it a problem that should
&gt; dissaude me from buying this bus, i.e. will it cause worse performance on
an
&gt; extended road trip?
