Subject: dual solex project

Hello list,

I am filled with questions as I try and build a stock
dual solex carburator settup for my 74 bus with 73
engine in it. I purchased a set of dual solex
carburators that only included the carburators,
manifold, and balance tube. This balance tube had
somesort of vacuum can or somthing attached to it. The
carburators didnot have an egr valve or any of the egr
switches that you find on the 73 and 74 models so I
guess they are from a 72. The po of my bus had
installed a progressive carb that was in need of work
and a worn out 009 distributor. Karl was able to get
me a distributor (thanks Karl!). I just want my bus to
run right.

How do the vacuum tubes hook up from the vacuum can on
the distributor. I don't remember seeing it in my
bently manuel. Is the 2 way cuttoff valve
importantant? I don't have one. My bus is automaitc by
the way.

I have another question, Each manifold had a hose port
near the base. The hose port opening was about 1'2&quot; or
so. What purpose do these serve and what hooks up to
them? They are below where the egr  valve would be.

My idle mixture distributor is not can shaped like
shown in the Bently, but rather it just branches off
wher the idle mixture distriburot is suppose to be. It
also has another branch that seems to go to where the
air pump should be. I have no airpump, so can I just
plug this branch and use this mixture distributor tube
settup?

I am thinking about buying a oil bath air cleaner for
this settup.  What do you think about that? I have
found 2 that I am debating on.

I want to thank everyone who is reading this and I
appreciate any help that you can give me. Thanks!
