&lt;&lt; I need some help Volks.  I just got a 12v BN2 gas
heater and I'm having problems with the fuel pump.  It
gets power to the terminals (I've hooked it up
direct)and I get no clicks or pumping. &gt;&gt;

I don't know if this is good advise or not, so you decide if it's worth 
trying.

An old long time VW mechanic I know says he cam almost always revive a gas 
heater fuel pump by soaking it in WD40 for a couple of days.
