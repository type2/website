Subject: How to keep a Volkswagen happy? Or, Drive Your VW to Work Day

My Volkswagens are pouting again.  I haven't been paying enough
attention to them.  They seem to be a pretty tight knit group and I
did 2 things recently that REALLY upset them and now I'm paying the
price.  The first thing is that I sent my '70 Bus to Minnesota with my
daughter.  That was a sad day for me and I think the other VWs felt
the same way.  One broke a speedo cable.  Another developed carb
problems.  And a third, well that one's just old and cranky.  But then
I committed the ultimate sin.  I started putting time and money into a
Corvair Greenbrier.  The Volkswagens put a hex on it -- big time.  The
first time I tried to drive it down to the DMV one of the valve
rockers came loose.  The next time went better but by then the VWs had
enlisted the DMV workers.  They told me that, while everything checked
out with the vehicle, I still couldn't get the new plates because it
had no back seat.  Going by the book, that means that it must be a
commercial vehicle and everyone knows that a commercial vehicle is
charged by weight.  That meant another day away from work to go get it
weighed.  So on Tuesday I got the weight certificate but the VWs were
still at it.  I made it half way to DMV before running out of gas.
Then after leaving DMV the VWs mustered all of their collective powers
and caused the Corvair to spit up a hairball.  I don't know what it
really was but I barely made it home.

So, now I'm trying to show my Volkswagens that I really do love them.
This week I sent my Adventurewagen on a camping trip (since I didn't
have the time to spend, it went with a good Volkswagen friend).  Both
Ghias got cleaned up and put to bed in their car covers for a few days
until I have a chance to work on their minor problems.  And, since
today is Drive Your VW to Work Day, the old man -- known as Flash --
is getting the attention he deserves.  He's hauling some heads to the
machinist to demonstrate my commitment to keeping him and his brethren
on the road.  Then I think I'll stop off at my VWFLAPS and see if
there's some little trinket I can pick up for him and his pouting
friends.
