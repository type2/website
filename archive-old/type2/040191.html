Subject: Oil pressure light flickering

I have a 1980 Vanagon that seems pretty much stock. About 70,000 on the 
odometer and probably original as the rest of the bus and camper package 
looks great. Right after I got it, I changed oil and filter (used MANN filter 
from Bus Depot-it had a Fram from PO). I normally use Valvoline SAE 30 but 
was using Chevron SAE 30 due to FLAPS being out of the Valvoline 30. After 
the change, I drove to town (Ridgecrest, 25 miles one way) and didn't notice 
any problems. I drove back including a killer hill in the last mile-almost 
had to go to 2nd gear at one point. Pulled into my place and when engine went 
to idle the oil light began flickering rapidly. After the engine cooled 
everything normal. Happened on second trip to town a few days later. I 
changed the oil to Valvoline SAE 40 (we are now in the 90-100 degree 
temperature phase of our climate). Seemed OK, until drove home again up the 
&quot;hill&quot; and got oil light flicker. I have brand new engine compartment seal in 
place for both trips. All other cooling system parts seem to be there and 
functional except thermostat doesn't look like it changes position. Local VW 
shop said it fails to &quot;open&quot; for max cooling. Any suggestions? I cannot find 
specific reference to this problem but vaguely remember (old age) list 
mention in last year. Thanks for help.
