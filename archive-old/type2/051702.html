Subject: Re: [T2] Canadian importation

Hi Al,

I've got an 82 Westy diesel.  I like it, but it sure
could use a turbo.  Let me know how you make out.

I've talked with several people who own turbo diesel
vanagons, but bought them used that way.  I wondered
if they were sold in Canada, or maybe imported?  I
can't believe there are that many owners who would
install their own turbos.  Good luck.

&gt; I'm a diesel fan, have an 82 Vanagon diesel and am
&gt; going to put a turbo on
&gt; it. I believe you're mistaken about them being
&gt; dirtier. Canada has at least
&gt; as strict emissions standards as the US. Most VW's
