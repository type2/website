Subject: Re: [T2] Where to buy fuel line clamp

&gt;I use a golf tee to plug off my lines when working.... May not be the most
&gt; recommended mechanical way, but it works.  Nary a drip.
&gt;

Since the golf tee was recommended by St. Muir - and since he sold 2 million 
books (I think I read that recently) - I would say that the golf tee is 'the 
most recommended mechanical way'
