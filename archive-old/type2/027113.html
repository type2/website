Subject: 1600 engine into 1972~79 VW 17/18/2000 Type 2

From: Nigel A. Skeet, Great Britain
To: VW Type 2 listees

For those who are interested, I have available for sale, the rear engine 
support bar and chassis brackets, plus some the large bell-housing tinware, 
to fit a VW 1600 twin-port engine, into a 1972~79 VW 17/18/2000 Type 2.

However, shipping them to the USA and other overseas territories, is 
unlikely to be cheap!

Regards.
