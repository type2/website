Subject: Re: [T2] Catalytic Converter

Look on your drivers door post for a sticker. It will be a small emissions
sticker below the big one that has the vin # and builddate on it. It should
say &quot;NON - CATALYST&quot;. Fed vehicles are non cats. Look on the back side of the
engine lid. The tune up/ emission sticker will say that it meets USA specs and
has no cat.
If both stickers are missing......shoot whoever repainted the bus! He is
causing all your troubles:)
Cheapest way out is to buy another engine lid with the correct emission
sticker on it!

&gt; Here's a question from the &quot;can't fight city hall&quot; department.  I took Sweet
&gt; Pea (1979 Westy, Federal 2.0 FI) for an emissions test, and she passed the
&gt; smog test but failed the equipment test.  Specifically, the inspector
&gt; wouldn't pass me because I had no catalytic converter.  When I installed the
&gt; new engine, I put on a free-flow exhaust, figuring my new engine would pass
&gt; smog.  However, I didn't realize they would be such sticklers for original
&gt; equipment.  Aargh!  Stupid smog controls!  It's times like this that make me
&gt; want to sell my Bus and buy a Honda.

&gt; So, my question is this:  Will a 1979 Federal Cat bolt onto a 72-74 Muffler?
&gt;   If not, can it be welded on?  My original muffler didn't have a Cat
&gt; either, so I'm not really sure what should go on there.  Looking at the
&gt; specs, however, it looks like the stock crossover pipe/Cat/muffler setup is
&gt; the way to go, but it's VERY expensive.
