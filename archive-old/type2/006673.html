Subject: Broken exhaust studs, why?
Date: Thu, 5 Jul 2001 06:54:25 -0500

    You don't have to break those exhaust studs because of frozen exhaust
nuts, unless you want to!

    Take a very sharp chisel, place it on the flat of the exhaust stud nut
aligned with the stud, strike (that's Yankee for hit it with a hammer) it a
couple of times in the same place, the chisel will leave an indention, along
with this indention, it will spread the nut slightly, just enough to loosen
the threads making the nut very easy to remove, saving the stud. BTW discard
the nut when reassembling.
    If you can get them the factory nuts (with the heil coil insert) are
easer to remove next time. They come in a factory muffler installation kit,
along with the right screws for the sheet metal, etc..

Grant, Bob, list:
This is one of those places where an ounce of prevention is worth a couple
of
pounds of cure. Shoulda put the torch on the nut and saved the stud!
Having said that, you can still heat the aluminum with a torch and use a
vise
grips, preferbly a NEW one with very sharp teeth. If this fails, use a
dremel
and a cut-off wheel and cut it off and drill it out and tap it or drill and
tap
oversize. This is getting into the realm of THINGS RATHER DONE WHILE THE
HEAD IS
ON THE BENCH, so choose your battles carefully.
