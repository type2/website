Thanks for the links and advice from everyone. So I bought that temp sensor #2 under many people's suggestions but what happened when I started to remove the old one is a story I'm afraid way too stupid to tell:

I didn't of course have a 13mm extended socket, so I did my best with the open-end offset wrench. I managed to pretty royally round off the nut. I also did the stupid thing of clipping the wire that came off the sensor thinking I could get a normal socket on it. Now the bus won't run to get it to a mechanic who knows more about these things.

I bought an extended socket but just chewed up the nut some more. I managed to get a vise grip on the thing and it's been bathing in Liquid Wrench since last night, so I hope I can get it loose tonight. 
Unfortunately, the main rigid fuel line that carries fuel to the injectors is very close to this thing. Am I safe in using heat (propane torch) to heat the surrounding area hoping that the aluminum head will heat faster than the thermistor and I can get it out? Is that really dangerous with the fuel lines so close? Any other suggestions?

Thanks for all who wrote in to help. I can only hope that this will solve my probs once I get it replaced.
