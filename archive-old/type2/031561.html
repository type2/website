&gt; &gt; &gt; I use the starter fluid because it leaves little or no

&gt; &gt; however I do have a air/acetelene torch (plumbing type, low presure)  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; amount of acetelene &quot;hurt&quot; the engine???
&gt; 
&gt; I had an exchnage back some years ago about finding vaccum leaks in a bus
&gt; using flammable solvents as leak detectors.  May I humbly submit that this
&gt; is not wise???  Starting fluid is an ether and has a flash point that is

sort of what I thought too

&gt; WD-40 - Again, it is way less flammmable thna gasoline, plus it will seal
&gt; the leak if it is thin and cause the engine to slow down.  Yes, it makes a
&gt; mess, but you are alive to clean it up.

well today I wasted half a can of WD-40 to no effect, still haven't
figured it out.

but turning the idle bypass screw has no effect on the idle speed so I am
beginning to suspect the Auxiliary air regulator....????
