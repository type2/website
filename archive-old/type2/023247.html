Hi Melissa, 

The spring steel &quot;starnut retainers&quot; are somehow crimped 
into place. Once they are gone VW suggests to replace 
the backing plates. But they too are NLA from VW and the 
last known price was about $50. I have seen the lil 
springs somewhere at the shows over here in Europe, but 
that too has been a while. What you could do is go to a
Porsche dealer, or call a classic Porsche parts supplier, 
and ask for these clips for a, say, 1960 356. These look 
like half the thingie that was/is on you bus and have a 
little hole in them. On Porsches they are held on with 
a little screw. If you have some of these, you could 
repair your backing plates, either by welding them into 
place, or by drilling a hole, and using a sheet metal 
screw to hold them in place, or even tap the hole and 
use a little machine screw. 

Hope it helps, 

Brian
