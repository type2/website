Subject: Re: [T2] Booster/stiff pedal (was Re: vac booster check valve)

Joe,

Easy way to find out!  Disconnect and plug the vacuum line at the rear
and try it out.  

Makes a big difference to me in how it feels.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt;If you can leg press 500
&gt; &gt;pounds, you can probably live without it, but if not, it can be important.
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen this comment several places and I just don't get it.  I've been driving my '71 Westy without the booster for several years and yes, it certainly doesn't feel 
&gt; like power brakes, but it's not a big deal.  FWIW, I'm not ripped and buff, and my right leg is only marginally larger than my left one. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Seriously, have you guys experienced dead-booster buses as being hard to brake?
&gt; 
&gt; (My daughter does say the pedal is a tough one, and I'd sure love to have a working booster, but they ain't cheap....)
