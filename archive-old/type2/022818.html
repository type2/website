Subject: stripped bolt
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

i was reinstalling my push rod tubes (72 westy, stock engine) and i stripped 
one of the bolts that holds the rocker arm to the head, Bently lists it as 
quality 6 G. Does this mean i cant go to a local hard ware store and buy a 
new bolt? Do i have to go to the dealer?
