Subject: Re: [T2] painting an engine

PPG is great paint.  Your local dealer can advise on the various kinds
available and suitable in your area.  You might be able to have the pieces
powdercoated for what a quart of  DAR 9000 (nicest shiny black you could
ever want) costs. They also make a cheaper line called Omni, which is just
fine as far as I can tell.  PPG's DP 90 black  epoxy primer makes a good
base for black parts exposed to stuff coming up from the road.  Ordinarily
you'd use contrasting color primer, but here you want to not call attention
to any dings.

Use hi temp paint for the heater boxes and ex manifolds.

Grant

&gt;So, now that I've got my engine out (fixing a bad piston), I want to
&gt;repaint the tin, intake runners, cooling ducts, manifold and anything
&gt;else that needs painting (not case, heads, or cylinders).
&gt;
&gt;I'd like to have a nice hard finish that is going to resist flaking and
&gt;also be able to handle the temps in the engine compartment.  What would
&gt;be my best bet (paint type, brands, etc) to finish these parts?  I'm
&gt;going to degrease them and sandblast them first to get them clean and
&gt;smooth..
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Mike
