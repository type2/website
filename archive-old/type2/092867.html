Subject: Re: [T2] My bus is running, well.. close to great!

Running hot and burning off paint or oil off that new engine?


&gt;Listees,
&gt;
&gt;Some of you know I've been battling with getting my bus to idle. I bought a
&gt;new carb,  lets see, nearly two weeks ago but it's still not here. With help
&gt;from some great list members I found the problem with my bus. The idle
&gt;control was disconnected. I got that hooked up and the bus still ran a bit
&gt;poorly. A friend of mine came by today and adjusted my existing carb and
&gt;checked my timing. Now my bus runs pretty well. I took it for a long spin and
&gt;no problem. Now I have a bus that idles and new brakes that stop it. Wow. ; )
&gt;I did notice however that when I parked it a bit of white smoke was coming
&gt;from the vents on the back pillars. Smelled kinda oily. Normal? The bus only
&gt;has about 200 miles on it since a complete rebuild. I did have the valves
&gt;adjusted at 100. Seems to have good power and idle fine.

Ciao!
