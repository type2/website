&gt; &gt; I'm looking for a late 1970s Westy, and I came across this posting

&gt; &gt;  ------------------------------
&gt; &gt;  1. ...a 1977 Westfalia overnighter/hard top...asking $4,500 firm.
&gt; &gt;  2. ...a 1978 VW transporter...asking $3,200 firm....
&gt; &gt;  ------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; It means that the person is asking you to give them $xxxx and that
&gt; they won't sell the bus for less than that amount.  Seems pretty clear
&gt; to me!

Sorry about the confusion then!

As the poster of &quot;2 busses for sale&quot; I shall clarify!

The asking firm bit means that we are currently asking for that ammount
and as of right now, we're not budging.  If we don't sell them after a
couple of months, we'll consider REASONABLE offers less than our asking
price.  Dad has had his for maybe 15 years and I've had mine for 9
years, so we're in no big hurry to sell.  These were our &quot;fishmobiles&quot;
and are we're still somewhat sentimental.

What's UNreasonable?  Well, I had a phone call (local paper ad)
countering $1500 on the Westie.  Shheeeet, these motors cost us $1300 to
have rebuilt alone!

Again, sorry about any confusion.

Mark
