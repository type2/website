Shawn,

The biggest problem you face is you are working with the wrong part.  Because 
of this, you can't apply the correct tune up specs for your year bus.

If you can't find a good used or rebuilt stock distributor, (1st choice) many 
feel that the aftermarket distributor with the best advance curve for the 
type 4 engine is the .050 (2nd choice).  Third choice would be the .009.

Also be aware that much of your popping can be from exhaust leaks.  Fix them 
first and also make sure you point gap is correct.

Its my understanding that the type 4 engine needs 8 to 10 degrees more total 
advance than the .009 is capable of.  The best you will probably get is an 
average somewhere that will either short you advance at full acceleration or 
at idle, in other words, you are kind of on your own and at the mercy of 
varying opinions as far as specs go.

Can you borrow a timing light from somewhere?  I'm only running on bad memory 
here, but without the correct distributor and thus no specs to go from, I 
think you would time an .050 to around 38 degrees of total advance at 3500 
rpm.(?)
Anybody???

I'm not sure what the &quot;best&quot; thing to do with the .009 is.  If you set it for 
7.5 degees before tdc at idle you probably won't get enough total advance for 
maximum performance etc.  If you set it for 38 degrees of total advance at 
3500rpm I have no idea what it will do to your idle.  (this may be what they 
were aiming you toward)

My last bus came with an .009 and I replaced it right away with a good used 
stock dist. that I picked up at a swap meet.  I guess you could say my 
solution to the problem was wimping out and avoiding it entirely.  The bus 
idled OK with the .009 so I'm guessing it was timed close to correct there 
and I was probably losing power and fuel economy at highway speeds and at the 
top end of the power band without really feeling it.  Ignorance is bliss, the 
correct dual advance dist. worked great!

As a last resort, someone on the KG list once described how you can get very 
close by ear.  You advance it just past peak idle, then retard it just past 
peak idle, then set it at some point in that range.  If you can get one of 
the experienced guru's on the list to give you that point, you will be very 
close to the best you can get with what you have.
  
Anybody???

good luck,
