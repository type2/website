Actually, all you need are the bars. The cot material is the same size but
the color is different. Yours should be beige. Splits are green. The half
moons are different also. The split ones use brackets like the one mounted
to the wall for the table to lock into place when folded down, on a 71
Westy. If you get a pair of round black bars from a 68 Westy/early 69, you
can cut, shorten, and reweld them. The 68 bars are 56 1/4'' long. On a
split, the front bar is 47'', the rear bar is 55 1/4''.

If anyone else wants to do this, I have a couple of extra pairs of
bars......
&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I've got a baby cot out of a 71 westy that I would like to trade for the
&gt; same that would fit a 66 westy.  Anyone out there want or need to swap?
The
&gt; cot is in VG shape ~ minus the mounting brackets.
