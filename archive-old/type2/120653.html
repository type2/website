Subject: Re: [T2] loss of power.....

nope thanks though... i went and checked.... worth a shot...
just for some reason feels like its out of timing... 
ok so i will read on in the archives see if i can figure this out...
the valves need adjusting anyways so that might have somethign to do with it...?
its a brand new rebuild and its got 500 miles on it now... nothing over 50 mph......
i think the reccomendation is 300 miles adjust valves isnt it?
i have to see if i can find the dizzy # and engine code and number...
i think it is a 009 dizzy not sure...?
theres no vaccum hose to it just spark plug wires...
this is a engine i am useing while mine is being rebuilt,,,.,.
thats why i am not sure of all the things on it... havent had to know till now..
so i guess i will start out in the morning and start timing...
can i pull it off without a dwell meter..?
i have a standard strob light....
and my feeeler gauges....
peace
Chris.
