Hi Chip,

I did this on my '73 without removing the tranny, its a bit tight on space
but very do-able.

I did this with the manual box in neuteral which ment both bits of the rod 
moved around. Next time (if there ever is one) I would give it a go with the 
box in 1st or 3rd gear, ie with the coupler held as near the tranny as 
possible to gain a bit more working space. 

I think you could do this with an automatic too, but I don't know what gear 
you would select.

Bob
