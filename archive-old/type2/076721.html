&gt; have you ever wondered about all the RailRoad Names that are used on

&gt;   If I recall the Model Railroad Industry Assoc, has a contract with

for
&gt; the use of the coorporate logos and names.
&gt; 
&gt; how hard would it be for VW to license small time folks at $1 for 10 
years
&gt; or something, pro forma.  everyone wins, VW controls thier name, 
people
&gt; get to use the logo legally and VW can keep misuse down.

The difference is that nobody is going to mistake a HO-scale boxcar for 
a product of the BNSF railroad, nor would the BNSF be endangered 
legally by an accident involving one of these boxcars.  

The parts that folks would like to put VW logos on are not toys or 
miniatures, and they have definite safety issues associated with them 
that VW would not like to deal with.

Frankly, I'd just as soon not give VW the advertising.  Keep my 
mudflaps plain, please.
