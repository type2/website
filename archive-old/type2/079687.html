Subject: VW Diesels

I've got an 85 turbo diesel.  I call it the Antichrist.  If you've ever seen
'THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY&quot; you'd understand.

I get 50 MPG and can almost get out of my own way going downhill with a
tailwind.  I also go 100 miles per day to work and back all week on $13 of
fuel.  Is it a bus?  No.  Would I put this engine in a bus?  No, but I would
entertain thoughts of a slightly more powerful one.  I hate the car but my
wallet speaks louder than my aesthetic desires.  It's not a bus, and once I
spoon tyres on my old airhead BMW and it warms up a bit the Antichrist will
be relegated to really bad weather days.  There are air-cooled diesels
available, you see them mostly in industrial strength wood chippers and
such.  I think Wisconsin makes them.  Again, probably not bus power
material.

Scribed by others:
&gt; &gt; I'm curious because I love the simplicity of my air cooled engine, but
&gt; &gt; I'd love to get to something more sustainable, like a diesel engine
&gt; &gt; running on veggie oil.

&quot;I read somewhere that 77 per cent of all the
mentally ill live in poverty. Actually, I'm more intrigued
by the 23 per cent who are apparently doing quite well
for themselves.&quot;
