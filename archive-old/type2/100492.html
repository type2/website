Subject: fuel sender/gauge?

these are the days of my veedub....

I had the shop replace my fuel tank sender while some recent work
was done needing the motor to be removed and before it used to register full 
when all full, then none after a little less than a quarter was gone.

new sender : now, I started to realize something was wrong when my gauge 
said I was empty, when I had hardly gone 200 miles so far (my old paper/pen 
gauge) - then I filled the tank, and now it shows half full.

great. a bad sender, or bad gauge, or is there an adjustment you can make to 
the gauge itself? id hate to think I paid for a new sender when all I had to 
do was adjust the gauge?

any ideas, thoughts, suggestions/
