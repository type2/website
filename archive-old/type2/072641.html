Subject: cooling shutter factoid
Message-Id: &lt;v01510114b3666570ae1f_at_[207.172.43.81]&gt;

I have a 1600 block on the test stand and have just installed the fan
housing sans generator so I can watch the swing of the shutter blades as
the thermostat expands and contracts.  What I found is puzzling.

I followed Bentley and mounted the thermostat on the bracket so that the
top inside surface of the bracket just touches the top of a cold thermostat
bellows with the shutters fully open.  This means that the position of the
shutters with cold thermostat is whatever the bellows stroke allows. So set
it at full open and let fully closed be whatever.   This is sort of
analogous to the way we set timing:  set it to 30 degrees at full rpm and
let the timing at idle be whatever.

I now see that the rectangular opening in the bracket defines the stroke on
the bellows and that this corresponds to only a fraction of the swing that
the shutters are capable of. Matter of fact, I'd estimate it to be maybe 25
percent of that maximum allowable swing.

If this is all the restriction that is invoked when the engine is cold,
maybe it is no wonder that it makes no difference whether or not we have
those shutters installed.

I'd love to hear if I'm missing something here.
