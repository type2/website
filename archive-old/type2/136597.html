Subject: Re: [T2]Blowby From Dipstick *(saga continues)

yeah i cleaned this when it was on my engine...
that could be it someone suggested that then is why i cleaned it then...
i can blow through it now buttttttttt could that still be the problem some how...
 
i just think its awful coincedental the same problems on a tottaly diffrent engine....?

Could be your air breather valve (PCV) is clogged. Take it off the 
breather on top of your engine, wipe off the bottom, and try blowing 
through it . If you can't, it's clogged. Soak it in kerosene, shake, 
and bang against solid object taking care not to break it. Soak some 
more. Repeat until restriction is gone.
