Subject: Re: [T2]  Using SAE30 in 2.0 FI with Hydraulic lifters...

&gt; I've been using 20-50 in my 77 with good results however, I just arrived in
&gt; Tucson AZ a few days ago and despite driving through the night from San
&gt; Diego, the bus was just getting too hot to run over 52-53 mph. I'm planning
&gt; on driving all the way to the east coast and would like to run at about
&gt; 60mph if I can keep the oil temp down. A local in Tucson recommended running
&gt; straight 30. Would running this heavy of an oil be bad for the Hydraulic
&gt; lifters?
