Well, things are getting better and better.    I had a virtually trouble-free
trip to Seattle and back, taking 200 miles round trip, as I went a bunch of
places.

The brakes seem to drag a bit, and the loose dash wires created a little
smoke (where is my electrical tape?) , and it did sprinkle a little on the
way home.   I rigged an early style wiper and pivot on the driver side in
Seattle, so I could reach under the dash and wipe away the drops.    Milage
has improved to 17mpg.  I think with a little brake attention (it has all new
wheel cylinders and rubber hoses, BTW)  and a matched set of tires this will
improve.

I still don't have a tent (gentle hint).    People at the bus club actually
seemed to LIKE the bus, though, to be honest, it was the ugliest split there.
  (But they saw the potential.   Maybe they are just too kind to dog it.
   And I random person who walked by while i was writing notes (I have a
little logbook for the bus, to keep records on it) said - wow- cool old
volkswagen! to her boyfriend.\\\   Everyone loves a split.

We Must Save Them!!!
