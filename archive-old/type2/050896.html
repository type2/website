Subject: [T2] T4 longetivity (a long rant, was Wilson's book)

I'll add one further comment, T4 engine life is directly proportional
to the load the vehicle puts on the engine.  In high school I had a
beat 914 with 250k on the original engine and it still showed
respectable compression and performance.  Most Buses seem
to go 150-175k and still run alright with mileage and power
tapering in the end.  Vanagons can get as little as 65k miles
out of a 2.0 and you see lots of em with the engines replaced
around 100-110k miles.  All this for mid-atlantic driving where one
occasionally encounters the odd mountain.  In the midwest I
bet you can drive a '82 Westy with automatic and A/C 150k miles
at 70mph without a problem.  Which brings up another one, life
is also directly proportional to your right foot, that Vanagon and
all those Buses were built in the day of 55 mph speed limits,
keeping up with the 75mph traffic means watching a head go in as
little as 15k miles with the Spanish heads if you aren't lucky.
The first thing you should do when you buy a Bus is put an oil
temp gage in the sump and watch what happens.  For my '82
with the new 2.0 to maintain speed on WV interstate.

55mph - 185F,  60mph - 200F, 65mph - 215F, 70 mph - 230F

about 15F per 5 mph, and you can also jump up one set of temps
by going up a hill.  I drive by the oil temp gage, NOT the speedo.
I drive it at about 215F, if I'm doing 65 good, if I'm doing 50mph
on a hill, whatever.  This is an auto, and a pig, it is better in a
Bus by far.

Wonderous life and power out of the T4 in a 2500 lb car is an
entirely different thing than in a camper pushing on 2.5 tons or
more fully loaded.

Still having looked at Raby's adds, I am real impressed by the
fact they at least are using Reicherts new heads as the basis
for all their stuff.  Don't mention their prices anywhere though
that I saw, commesurate with what they got in em of course
I'll warrant and with backing an impressive 20k warranty.

Anyway, sorry for the tirade, again I love the T4 engine, but
expecting unreal life and performance is simply the kind of thing
that gets you deeper and deeper in debt till you got to sell a real
cherry body that you've put like $5000 into, with a blown engine
to some smuck for $1000.  Thats how I've bought every van I've
owned, and there have been many.  I would as soon no-one on
this list has such unfortunate luck.

Again YMMV
