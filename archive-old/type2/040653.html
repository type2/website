Hey y'all
I ran a day over because I had to go grocery shopping Saturday morning with 
my wife, which if you ever saw our freezer, means a megamultihour event.  We 
'only' got to put in about 3.5 hours on the Express Saturday as the result.

The Great Compression Search is ended.  Friday, I pulled the engine, 
stripped the tinware off, and mated it to the askew engine stand.  Sherry 
(the builder of the engine and my beautiful wife) and I popped the heads, 
removed the spacers, Pulled 1&amp;2 jug'n slug, added 0.010 shims under the jugs 
(to make up for CB Performance's machine chop), reinstalled and torqued 
heads, rockers, etc.

Saturday was about doublechecking the torques, reinstall all the tinware, 
and stepping in the used oil pan.  I also attempted to make stock heater 
dealies work around an extractor exhaust.

Today I set the valves, pulled the rest of the Everspanker BN4 ductwork and 
built suitable blockoffs for the holes left behind.  The removing of the 
head spacers changed the rocker geometry more than I thought.  Where before 
I had almost no screw showing past the nuts, there's about 5mm of screw 
showing now.  I be happier 'bout dat!

Installed the engine (I jacked the Express up about 10&quot; for this engine 
pull, MAKES LIFE EASIER), reinstalled with the help of the lovely engine 
builder, picked up all the flamnables behind the Express. Took her off the 
jackstands.  Put new oil in engine, cranked it over until she had pressure.  
Go back, install coil wires (oh yeah - gotta hook up the throttle cable), 
walk back up front and the Express grumbled back to life.  Sounds different 
though.  More purposeful perhaps.  Like it means the noise it's making.  
Checked the timing, spot on.  Pertronix sure makes life grand don't it? 
(until it fails, already posted that tale last year).

Big grin sliding around, I shut her off, picked up more stuff.  Cooked 
traditional steak on the barbequeue with ongyum and tater.  Had Sherry move 
the Bronkoid, remembered to readjust the clutch cable (loose cable makes 
installation easier too), Heidi jumped in and off we burbled.

The Burrito Express has more 'go' by my calibrated seat of the pants 
impression.  Acceleration is better.  Drove 'round the block (10 mile run).  
Oil Temp while running stayed about 125-130 at 60 mph.  Previously after 5 
miles of 60mph it'd be knocking on the 180 door.  Cruising around, definatly 
the feel of more power.  Cooler running (confirmed with gauge).  In all a 
sucessful weekend and I can take tomorrow and go swimming with the kids and 
the dogs.

Oh yeah.  I figured out the excess heat in the engine room is coming from 
the exhaust. Any suggestions for what to use for insulation  unger the rear 
apron?

&quot;The question is, said Alice, whether words can mean so many things&quot;
