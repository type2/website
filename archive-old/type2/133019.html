Subject: Re: [T2] Coil connection mixup

Barry,

No problem, the reversal will just make the primary spark lots(15%)
weaker.

I've seen lots of vw's that have been running for years that way.

I would suggest that the 42mph top speed is the results of 15 years of 
other stuff...

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello.  On a '76 FI 2000 Calif model w/standard trans and w/air conditioning

&gt; 
&gt; What would be the implications if the coil was connected back-a$$ward.  That 
&gt; is, the wires that should go to the + were connected to the -, and the wires 
&gt; that were connected to the - were connected to the +.
&gt; 
&gt; This conditioned only existed for a short while, like 5 minutes of 
&gt; unsuccessful cranking, and 5 minutes of idle.
&gt; 
&gt; The VW runs now, but verl sluggish, with a max speed on the level of 42 mph. 
&gt;   It has not run for the past 15 years, so I am kind of happy to get this 42 
&gt; mph (on the level ground).
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
