&gt; 1.  Where the heck is the brake fluid reservoir in a '78 Westy?
Hey I know this one :) It is right under the drivers seat, in front
where the seat housing meets the floor board. If you add brake fluid a
word of warning, there is a little plastic filter/strainer that you pour
it thru, go slow the first time to see how fast your strainer allow
flow. My first time I poured way too fast and it went everywhere.
