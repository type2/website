&gt; Hello everyone.  I have had my 72 Bus about 11 years and have been on
&gt; this list that long although I don't post very often.  A while ago my
&gt; bus engine blew up, usual dropped valve.  I replaced it with a
&gt; Corvair engine which works pretty well but isn't a perfect fit.  It
&gt; is hot here in Maryland and my tin work is not helping the engine
&gt; stay cool as it should.  I'd like to find some material to fabricate
&gt; a better air seal.  The material needs to be flexible like cloth or
&gt; inner tube material but also fire resistant (won't catch on fire or
&gt; melt).  Any ideas?

where in Maryland.??

I've used pipe insulation material in a pinch.
