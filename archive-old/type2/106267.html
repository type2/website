Subject: Re: [T2] Painless Wiring??

&gt; I was considering going with the painless wiring system. The original wiring
&gt; harness is nearly 30 years old now, and who knows how many times it's been
&gt; hacked into. What would you guys suggest? Would painless wiring be a decent
&gt; solution?
&gt;
&gt; I'd love to hear from anyone that's done any kind of a complete wiring
&gt; harness conversion.

I dont know what &quot;painless&quot; means but you can buy a replacement harness
for the bus. correct colors etc...
