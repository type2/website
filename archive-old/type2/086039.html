Subject: Re: [T2] What IS this stuff?



#8 seems to be the rubber insert of a striker plate for one of the doors.

&gt;1) Not a clue....not bus related
&gt;2) Goes behind the window crank handle
&gt;3) A new injecter
&gt;4) An American car flasher
&gt;5) Radio knob
&gt;6) Wire end cover for the rear side marker lights
&gt;7) Inspection hole plugs for the rear brakes
&gt;8) ??? The 1st pic sorta looks like part of the connecter on the aux air 
&gt;valve
&gt;wire plug but the 2nd one kills that idea.
&gt;9) ???
&gt;10) petcock for a radiator!
&gt;11) 'choke' for your radio input wire, to cut down on ignition static, it
&gt;works best where you found it :)

&gt; &gt; Hey, while cleaning out a box I found in my bus when I bought it (1976
&gt; &gt; Westy) I came across a bunch of stuff that I don't really recognize...  
&gt;I
&gt; &gt; put pictures up on the following site...  Any ideas what any of this 
&gt;stuff
&gt; &gt; is?
&gt; &gt;
