You need to subscribe to the Vintagebus list. It is for buses 67 and
older.....

I have an extra USA bumper: it has overriders and a towel bar.

But not knowing where you are, shipping from Fresno, Calif may be too much.


&gt; has anyone purchased one of those complete motors from Scat? are they
&gt; any good? are they german parts?
&gt;
&gt; also, where can i find that front bumper, you know, the common 60's
&gt; bumper, with the guards or whatever. (do i put a question mark here?)
&gt;
&gt; and i had another question, but i dont remember what it was. so ill just
&gt; send this.
