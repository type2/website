Subject: Re: Time Capsule;also, tracing VIN's

Speaking of time capsules; when I got the 77 bus to part out from the
(2nd? owner)(rotted in front end) with 204,000 mi on the odometer,
running engine, I had assumed the engine had been rebuilt somewhere
along the line, and was going to save it for when the current 78 Westy
engine dies.......yanking the 77 apart, I found behind the sink cabinet
unsent postcards which let me trace the orginal owner, finding out it
had never been rebuilt!  You won't believe what can fall back there- any
interesting stories? Another spot is the cavity next to the flipbed on
the driverside- my daughter was forever losing crayons or candy back
there!
   I remember hearing about a service that lets you computer trace the
former owners (by registration) of a VIN... is this true?  A news report
on determining if your vehicle was in a flood prompted this thought-
