I don't think I would worry about total engine failure. Your diagnosis sounds 
just like a motor thats getting tired. As it gets more tired it will burn 
more oil, become slower to start and loose power, none of which should leave 
you stranded, its simply loseing its ability to compress. Short block vs long 
block, I would ask myself how was the motor treated and have I had any 
problem with the individual components, has the engine been overheated, have 
I had any charging problems, any carb leakage and so on and go from there
