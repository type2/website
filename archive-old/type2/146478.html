Subject: Re: [T2] It just wont run

&gt;Sure!  I'd love to come!  Where?

Im in La Plata MD 20646 (for mapquest purposes).


&gt;1. Do you have fuel?

I replaced all the lines and the fuel filter as well, and i dont see
fuel in the filter?  Its very possible that their is not enough fuel
in the tank.  I'll put 5 gals in via gas can tmw.

&gt;2. Do you have air?

I rarely use rags, only my shirt because I've lost them, left them
and they've caught fire.

I just got a vacume guage and a remote starter so that I can check
the vacuum.  I'll do that tmw as well.

&gt;3. Do you have compression?

I dont have a guage for that, ill go to sears and get one.  its safe
to say yes however, because it was running perfect before i started
this a week ago.

&gt;4. Do you have spark?
&gt;
&gt;Hook up a dwell/tach and make sure that it registers.  Nothing quite
&gt;as
&gt;embarasing as having a wire off the coil.  Check for spark at the
&gt;plugs
&gt;with a screwdriver up the wire end and close to ground.  Rotate the
&gt;engine
&gt;to TDC and check the static timing.  Should be at ~7.5BTDC.

HUH?  (I got the spark part, the rest is just greek)

Thanks again to everyone,

David.
