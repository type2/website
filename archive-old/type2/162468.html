&gt; Keeping  $30 in your wallet in case of emergency makes more sense to
&gt; me than  carrying a spare coil.

what are the symptoms of a failing coil??
&gt;
&gt; hey Guys  yes on one hand and No on the other.  I seem to always  have a
&gt; bunch of spare parts laying around so carring a spare coil doesn't cost  me a
&gt; thing, The best thing about having it is that you won't be stranded on the  side

&gt; I have a bag that
&gt; contains a coil, fan belt, gen pulley, , valve cover gaskets, electric fuel  pump,
&gt; fuel lines with clamps,and a   Dizzy already set and tested.  I  just transfer

I use an old military ammo can but same concept, one thing that I carry is
the small relays that will stop you dead such as a double relay, fuel
injector resistor pack the little items that will stop one and be next to
impossible to find locally.
