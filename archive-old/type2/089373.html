Subject: Re: [T2] Name that mechanical failure #3

Here's an interesting one:

83' Vanagon. Wouldn't rev, got progressively worse over a couple weeks.
Finally got so bad the thing would start, rev once, then die. Compression
excellent, no fouling on plugs, good ignition.

The icing on the cake was when we had to move it in the yard from one place
to another, and one of our guys drove it without a problem when one plug was
left out!??? Ran fine with 1 plug not installed. WTF?

We figured it out, what was it?
