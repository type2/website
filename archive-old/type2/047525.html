I agree, I think there may be a bit of marketing going on here, though,  he
says he has $47,000 invested in it, and oh yeah!  It appeared on the front
cover of vw trends, March issue.

It will be at the car show this week-end in Huntington Beach Ca.  I ve got
to go take a look.  Hmm, let's see, should I buy it, or a 2001 Euro-Van?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;71 Bus/Transporter, immaculate, show condition, must see to appreciate,
&gt; &gt;Appraised at $45K, $38,500 or best.  858-271-2077
&gt;
&gt; It would need a good bit of heavy gold plating to be worth that much.
