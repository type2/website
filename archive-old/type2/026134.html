Eric,

The big plastic gear has probably slipped on its shaft at some point.  This
has some metal embedded in it that makes a circuit with spring contacts in
the gear casing.  The position of the gear on the shaft determines where the
wipers come to rest.
On my bus, the gear was completely loose so the motor whirred away without
moving the wipers at all.  I fixed it back on with epoxy, this was last
summer and it still works.
If the wipers always come to rest in the same place and don't seem to be
slipping, you probably just need to reset the arm on the shaft (the part
that has the two rods connected to it, there are probably proper words for
these things).

&gt; Why do my wipers stop in the up position when I turn them 
&gt; off?
