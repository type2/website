&gt;I have a case of transmission whine. 

Is it a whine or a whimper? Low fluid level can cause this and if you
continue on it surely develops into pissin' and moanin'. Drain the fluid
and inspect for metallica, fine hairs in small quantity ist nominal.
Chunks=rebuild. You will normally hear some serious bitchin' when chunks
are created. Clean lube is spec at all times for life of operation. Puts
rate of wear in it's proper place of inconsequence, at least when German
metalurgy is involved.
