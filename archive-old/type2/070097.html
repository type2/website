Subject: Metal cutting tools

Hi folks,

I'm about to cut a hole in my bus &lt;shudder--cringe&gt; for some recirculating
air duct for my gas heater.  I have to make some curved and straight cuts
and I'd like to do this as neatly as possible.  What is the best 110v tool
(no air compressor) to cut sheetmetal cleanly?  Would a Dremmel tool work on
sheetmetal or is that used for thinner/softer metals?  I've seen air
nibblers that look like they can cut a nice curve, but haven't chanced into
any electric nibblers--do these exist?

I could just use the drill/metal hand saw/grinder method for this, but I see
metal cutting in my future.  When I look through the Harbor Freight and
other tool catalogs it's difficult to tell by looking at the pictures and
the short descriptions which electric tool would be the ideal buy for auto
sheetmetal cutting.

Thanks,
Ron
