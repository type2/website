Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum hose hunt

Hi Tom -

I originally drew this image as shown on Bus Boys' site and did the
part number(s) layout around 10 years ago.  As noted by other posts,
this hose (14mm ID) is still available under a different part number
(can't remember for sure), so keep trying.  If you can't find it,
pmail me - I think I have a 10 foot roll of it stashed somewhere
(spare for my Westy, etc.).  Originally called for a 3 inch piece on
either Bay or Vanagon, but your description of what you really need is
around 6 inches long, perhaps more.  I'll ask $5 for the 6 inch piece
or $7.50 for a foot long piece plus postage, if anyone's interested.

&gt; I went outside to compare the Vanagon to my 75 bus. The inside diameter of
&gt; the hose is the same on both, 9/16 inch. Sorry, no metric caliper. Bus Boys
&gt; part number is N20371.03. The picture in their catalog shows a piece of
hose
&gt; a couple inches long attached to the decel valve at one end and attached to
&gt; the plastic tube that connects to the rubber Y fitting on the intake plenum
&gt; that the brake booster vacuum line also attaches to. I think my plastic
tube
&gt; was broken before I bought the bus because it is just a straight piece
about
&gt; 4 inches long. Consiquently the rubber hose has to be longer to reach from
&gt; the plastic tube to the decel valve.
