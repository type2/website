&gt;   So I'm on my way back from Busfusion (Ontario) this weekend and I lose #4.
&gt; Ran a compression tonight and the results are: 1-3 all 120 PSI #4 0 PSI. I was
&gt; hoping to pull the left head off without taking the motor out and see if I can
&gt; get away with just doing the valves or maybe change/rebuild the head.  Am I
&gt; crazy? Is it possible to pull the head without dropping the motor? If I end up

yes it is crazy, I have done it and it is probably harder than dropping
the engine..

&gt; dropping the motor I might just swap it with my other bus (paint job).  One
&gt; thing is for sure.... got to have it up and running for the Jitterbug in two
&gt; weeks. Any Suggestions?

swap engine less likely to have surprises, good luck
