Subject: Re: compression test, safety

&gt;My question now is about the compression test.

&gt;My concern is about safety.  Since you take off all the plugs, and lay the
&gt;plug wires around, won't gasoline be coming out of the sparkplug holes?
&gt;Won't those wires be getting a current?  Isn't this a dangerous combination?
&gt;Muir didn't mention this factor, so I'm asking you, who's done it a thousand
&gt;times.

Not a problem, for two reasons:

(1) The first thing you are going to do after you warm up the engine is
disconnect the coil wire. The spark-plug-type wire that runs from the coil
to the distributor. Pull it loose before you do anything else so you don't
forget.

This is not primarily to avoid an explosion hazard, it is primarily to
avoid touching a live plug by accident. Having a plug arc into you won't
kill you, but it's not something you'll do twice if you can avoid it. It
really, really hurts. ;)

(2) In carbuerated engines, the fuel/air is drawn into the cylinders by
manifold vacuum--it isn't *pushed* in by the carburetor, it's *pulled* in
by the vacuum that the piston creates when it moves downward in the
cylinder. The valves open and close so that it pulls air/fuel in through
the intake, pushes exhaust out through the exhaust.

But if you &quot;open&quot; the system by removing the spark plug, the vacuum will be
filled by whatever makes its way in through the easiest route--mostly
through the spark plug hole. The system still &quot;pumps,&quot; but there's no
direction to it, and very little moves through. Think of breathing in and
out into a paper bag. Probably a minute amount of gas still makes it into
the cylinder, but not enough to worry about. I bet you won't even smell any
gas when you do your compression test.

I don't know about fuel-injected systems, they probably still shoot gas in
whether the plug is in or not. All I know about FI could fit onto the head
of a pin with room left over for angels. ;)

The easiest way to hurt yourself doing a compression test is to burn your
fingers trying to spin out a plug without dropping it into the tinware
(because you forgot to get one of those neat sockets with the rubber gizmo
in it that holds the plug. I have been meaning to buy one of those for two
full years).
