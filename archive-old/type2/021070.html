Subject: Compression

Hm...  Just did a compression check on Sally.  I'd always THOUGHT she
was a stock 1776, even tho' she has NO oil filler neck coming thru the
tin and the dipstick in the regular bus position is cut off. The
functional  dipstick and filler (with the little box we know is the sign
of a porsche configuation that someone just found on the list) come off
the top of the engine.

Compression is 150 all around.

The only number I could find is CB043944, dual diaphragm vacuum dizzy,
weber 34 ict's, only the driver side carb is hooked up to vacuum, other
hose is plugged with screw.

Some more numbers from the little tower dude the oil filler box sits on
- VW EA 022-0100, more or less, in blue ink, seen from rear...

Any clues?

Teri
