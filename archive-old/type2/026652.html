Earlier this week I had to pick up some stuff on my way into work, 25 mi
rush hour expway pita.
I kept getting this odd feeling that this was the muggiest hootest fumiest
day I can remember and my bus ('68 Kombi) just didnt sound quite right. Well
about 23 miles on I happened to look around to notice YOU IDIOT YOU LEFT THE
DAMN HATCH OPEN!!!! Immediate sinking feeling as I had around 3K in tools
and wire etc in the back and I can see it spead all over the streets of
Miami. DREAD as I walk around the bus and WHEWWWWWW when I notice that
everthing is just where I left it. Thank You, you wonderful vehicle for
taking care of me again. Slam hand in hatch while closing. On to work. All
is well.
Andy
