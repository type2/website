Subject: Tag-Along Trailer Value?

I have been talking to an old couple who live about 80 miles out.  They 
have a Tag-Along Trailer that was sold by a VW dealer to go with the new 
'65 Beetle they had bought (back in '65 of course).  This is a 
fiberglass bodied, single wheeled trailer that attaches to the Beetle 
bumper.  I have seen a photo of one of these in a past issue of HVWs.  I 
haven't seen the trailer yet, so I can't comment on exact condition.

Any idea what this might be worth?
