I need to swap the back of my alternater because the *round* hole for air
flow needs to be &quot;D&quot; shaped to fit my elbow fitting from the fan shroud. I'd
rather find an elbow with both ends round, but cant. So, is it feasible to
swap the alternater back plate and what # or year do I look for? Mine is a
55a not a 70a if that matters.
Well is this even necessary to worry about sealing that union?  Alternaters
are very expensive, but I ran it for 3 years without burning it up without
that elbow being connected...it just blew in the general direction of the
air hole.
Surely one of you vw scholars will pick your brain and help me out!  And I
thank you for it!
