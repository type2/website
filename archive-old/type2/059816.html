Subject: rebuild opinions...

Howdy y'all-

I've got a 2.0l motor that I'm rebuilding the top end on (new P&amp;C's, heads
redone, etc) for my doublecab. As I was picking up my heads from the local
machine shop (Jeff's Bug Shop, Houston, Texas.. Great work!), I explained
to Jeff that I was just doing the top end on the motor. He gave me some
things to check on the motor before assembly that could save me headaches
later. (I know not the history of this motor except it's been rebuilt at
some point.) One tip was to pull the #3 rod and check the rod bearings.
Said that would give some idea of what to expect elsewhere in the motor,
and that #3 would probably be the most worn. Well, I pulled it tonight and
suffice it to say  I feel I should now be completely rebuilding the motor.
:( I'm really glad he gave me some tips before I had a rod poking through
one of my shiny new cylinders.

I have all the parts for the top end rebuild, and now will be replacing
the rod bearings, etc. My budget is already blown (heads needed a little
more work than thought), but I still need to keep it low. I was going to
replace the rod bearings, main bearings and cam bearings. Is all that
necessary? Is that not enough? Is there anything else I should do while
inside the case? Should I replace the rods?

I got some ideas from the archives on what to do, and there is a great
list of parts for the &quot;complete&quot; rebuild. Just looking for some opinions.

Thanks!
