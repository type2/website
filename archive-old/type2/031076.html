&gt; I need the 2 pieces of sheet metal that go underneath the fan at the very
&gt; back of the engine for a type IV motor.  These are the 2 pieces that screw
&gt; together and run from side to side with the oil filler sticking up through
&gt; one of the pieces and form that nice curve underneath the fan.  

mine and all that I have seen are 3 piece.
