Subject: RE: [T2] electronic voltage regulator to replace mechanical
  one??

Courtney,

i was dealing with a battery drain problem a while ago on my SC.  mine ended
up being an aftermarket gauge put in by the PO.

however, the best suggestion was this (in case you havent tried it yet):
-hook up multimeter to batter to measure current drain
-pull fuses one by one to isolate the circuit that is causing the problem

i don't know if this relates exactly to the problem you are having, but it
might help.

good luck,
