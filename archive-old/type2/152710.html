Subject: Re: [T2] Parcel Tray

Blame it on Volkswagen. The Bus Boys Parcel Trays are an exact repro of the
originals. I know this because in 1993 I was involved in creating the rubber
and plastic edging from an original pair. In my Dealer Accessory Book (where
I got the photo for Bus Boys to use in 1993 and subsequently on their
website), VW specifically notes that a modification may be needed when
installing the left tray. However, in my collection of Factory Parts
Bulletins (PB's) and Technical Bulletins (TB's), I don't have a copy of the
installation procedure(s) for the trays to substantiate what the Accessory
Book says.

&gt; &gt; Bus Boys has some very mesh style repro trays.
&gt; &gt; they are a lot more expensive though, and maybe not quite as functional.

&gt; I really don't like the term &quot;fusebox relocation&quot; in the text for this
&gt; tray. Fiddling with the fuse block seems like a way to create a lot of
&gt; new problems to go with your new parcel trays!
