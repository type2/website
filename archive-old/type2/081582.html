Subject: Re: [T2] Choke Valve Problems

If they are solex carbs with electric chokes you might want to check that
you have power to both chokes first.
If you do, loosen the bracket screws around outside of choke terminal
housing just to the point where you can turn the part with the electrical
terminal on it. Make sure you can move the choke flaps by hand easily first,
then turn the choke terminal housing (I forget which way) until the choke
valve closes(this shouldn't take more than 2/3 of a turn or so ) Don't force
it!
Then fire up the bus and watch to see when the chokes open (or if) ideally
they open at the same time as the engine warms.
This may take care of it or it may confirm what your mechanic was saying.
If they are indeed solex carbs the &quot;kit &quot; to rebuild them with is fairly
simple and comes with understandable instructions but is missing som
important parts like throttle shaft bushings and such but someone else may
know of a source for these.
Good luck
Brian.

Subject: [T2] Choke Valve Problems


&gt; I have a 79 Microbus that has twin carbs. The choke valves are not closing
&gt; at start up and it takes a while to start up. I recently had a mechanic
look
&gt; at it and he said both carbs had to be overhauled. I was wondering is the
&gt; helpful people on the list could tell me if I need to do this to solve
this
&gt; problem? If I do this will I need to replace the valves or just pull them
&gt; out clean them and put them back in? And finally, assuming I decide to do
&gt; all of this, how hard a task it is for someone who doesn't know a whole
lot
&gt; a about mechanics?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Nicholas
