Subject: Re: [T2] Westfalia Wood Stain- Oh, yeah...

After 3 trips to Lowes, I finally found an employee who knew exactly what I was talking about. It was next to the panelling in a white 8-foot strip standing up in a large PVC pipe. Thanks.                                               -Paul Deatherage
