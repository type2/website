Subject: Re: [T2] warped flywheel? on 76 bus

&quot;That statement's a puzzler to me.  &quot;Alignment&quot; of the clutch disk simple
allows the transmission shaft to slip through the center hole of the disk
easily when mating transmission to engine.  If you've got your transmission
mated to the engine the disk is &quot;aligned&quot; as much as it ever could be
because there's no radial movement of the disk possible at that point.&quot;

	Unless the disc is mounted upside-down, in relation to the flywheel.  The 
splined 'hub' will not seat properly if the disc is flipped upside-down upon 
installation.  Whether this causes the symptoms in question is still 
in-question.
