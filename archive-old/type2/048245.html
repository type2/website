Subject: [T2] IC-706 Installation

Several asked about my amateur radio in the bus installation, so..........

First off, I have two 1970 Westfalia camper buses, so I was wanting to 
be able to easily remove and install the radio from one bus to the other.

With this concept in mind ..............

I began by buying a floor console to mount between the front seats, and 
actually decided to place it on the floor backwards. It turns out that 
it is easier to place coffee mugs into their holders on the fly when 
the console is indeed mounted on the floor in a backwards 
configuration. Additionally, my &quot;normal&quot; front, the &quot;original intended 
&quot; back, drops off vertically, and will accept the main radio body being 
bolted to the console. I did this.

I then mounted the IC-706 radio faceplate to the ash tray assembly 
after I removed the ash tray front face. I mounted the radio face plate 
to the ash tray assembly by using a surplus mobile telephone universal 
angle type bracket assembly that I had in my junk stash. It is one of 
those mounts that has two mount flanges affixed to a common post by way 
of a universal angle assembly. This allows the faceplate to be adjusted 
for perfect position and angle on the car dash.

The radio now locates just beside me and on the floor, making it 
perfect for the microphone and key to be plugged. It also is very 
convenient for the attaching of the two antenna coax assemblies.

The radio face plate locates at just the perfect position for combined 
driving, tuning, and programming; just slightly away from the dash, and 
just below the good time tunes radio.

Antenna.........
back in the luggage rack area, I have bolted the AH-3 tuner assembly to 
two of the luggage rack carrier rods using stainless steel bolts and 
some flat aluminum plate. It is located just at the very bottom of the 
102&quot; whip antenna so that the feed line is not tuned; just the whip. 
The whip is held to the roof by a 3 magnet roof mount with a separate 
ground running to the sheet metal of the bus.

Just behind the 102&quot; whip is a separate 144/440 MHz Larsen whip which 
is also held in place by a single magnet mount.

I run the coax assemblies along the roof, under the pop tent canopy, 
and feed them into the sink vent pipe. The sink vent pipe has been cut, 
and a Tee fitting has been used as a union for the two pieces. Pulled 
out of this Tee comes the tuner cable and two antenna coax assemblies, 
which then feed down behind the passenger seat and over to the floor 
mounted radio body.

The entire installation can easily be removed and installed into my 
other bus in a matter of minutes whenever I desire.

Best part...............
The only permanent bus mods made were:
The cutting of the sink PVC vent pipe, and
The drilling of two small holes into the ash tray assembly front plate
(after the ash tray face plate had been removed).
No other drilling or permanent sheet metal had to be irreversibly altered.

Second best part...........
My good time radio has an auxiliary CD audio input jack that allows me 
to connect the IC-706 audio output into the good time radio input. It 
is really cool to be able to listen to all of the available IC-706 
spectrum through my stereo sound system.

With a Compufire (solid state Hall unit) ignition assembly installed, 
and all spark plug wires running through grounded coaxial cable braid, 
I have no ignition noise whatsoever.

Actual on the air operation results exceed that obtained from any other 
mobile installation I have ever used.

Just be on the look out for low bridge overpasses and low tree limbs !!

When I finally get around to buying a digital camera, I'll post 
pictures to my web site.
