Subject: Re: [T2] Gas leaks?

I think this might be a good time to discuss fire extinguishers, and how
surprised I am about how many people who own a Volkswagen don't carry a fire
extinguisher. With all the work and time (and money) i have put into my
beloved BusZilla (and any other Volkswagen) I ALWAYS carry a fire
extinguisher for each and every Volkswagen i own.

I personally have a little mount in the side of the little seat behind the
drivers seat that holds mine. Sometimes it is a pain cause its in the
walk-way, but readily available if needed. I have only seen one vw on fire,
and that was a sweet squareback, and the guy had everything he owned in it,
it engulfed the entire car before the time the fire squad got there.

Please go buy a fire extinguisher if you don't have one. I guess this may
fall under the...&quot;the one tool i didn't bring is the one i needed on the
road&quot; category. and as a different safety measure under the same
circumstances, replace your fuel lines if you haven't in the past year or 2,
or if the bus is new to you, even if they don't look cracked, the rubber
inside the hoses, underneath the braided cover maybe totally destroyed and
sometimes even a temperature difference (winter vs. summer) may cause some
sort of bulge or crack..
*remember to replace the lines all the way to the tank*

OK did i scare you enough....sometimes i get carried away with this topic, I
apologize for ranting and raving...now back to your scheduled program....
