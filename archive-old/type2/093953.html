Subject: 73 automatic trans

I am removing the engine to replace some bad rebuilt heads and decided to
re-install a 4spd instead of the automatic trans in hopes of better mileage.
back in November when I restored this bus someone (Vanagon man ) wanted an
automatic.  If you are still out there or if anyone else is interested in
buying this automatic with 65K miles please respond. it has worked well, and
have no reason to beleive it needs anything.
