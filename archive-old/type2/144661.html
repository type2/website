&gt; One more idea - now that now you have a leak in the fluid, if the fluid all
&gt; leaks out, you will have to bleed the whole system. You could take the stub
&gt; of the broken line out of the caliper and put it into the flex line, then
&gt; crimp the end so you don't have a continuous leak...

I don't follow.  All the fluid ran out.  I'll try finding the line and
bending it appropriately tomorrow.  I seem to have spoken too soon about
the shock having come off.  The metal part of it is stuck on the lower
torsion bar.  Heat someone said i believe.  I don't have a torck or
anything hotter than a match.  I could try having the wife glare at it.

Any advice?
