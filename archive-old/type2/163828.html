Subject: Re: [T2] New Pushrod Break-in period?

Previous Thread &quot;Rocker arm studs and me :-(&quot;


Lastly, my pushrods are 10.650&quot; (272mm).  One of the ends was kind of
&quot;chewed up&quot;  http://www.zachula_dot_com/newgallery/bustek/P1010355

&quot; Zach,  WHICH end of the pushrod was that?&quot;

*hangs head*  Remember the previous thread?  I broke two rules.....I
was hurrying and I was so focused on getting my pushrod tube seals
replaced that I didn't really keep track.  I took lots of pictures.
and there is one with everything out in relation to how it was in the
engine

Looking at this pic:
http://www.zachula_dot_com/newgallery/bustek/P1010345?full=1
it looks like it may be the exhaust rod and the lifter side.


Can solid lifters stick?
