&gt; &gt;Guys,
&gt; &gt;Where can I buy a Bentleys for my 75 type 2?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have a copy of John Muirs book (I love it!)...
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Powells_dot_com for any new or used book. I always check them first. In the
&gt; rare case they don't have what I want, then I check Amazon and others. The
&gt; apes at powells are infallible. If something goes wrong, they scatter and
&gt; find out and fix it NOW, ie TODAY. They are truely outstanding and SERVICE
&gt; oriented cum laude. MUCH better results with just a little extra effort.
&gt; They may not know it, but their procedures reek of the DM.
