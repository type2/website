Subject: Re: [T2] Curse of the Voodoo Vacuum Leaks

 &gt; 4) STILL leaking vac at the plenum itself!  Exact location unknown
(they've been using the old propane trick to track these down).
 &gt;  At this point, the bus actually runs _worse_ than before, the shop  owner
mentioned something about 6% O2 that I couldn't quite digest.  He is
admittedly stymied at this point as to why the bus is actually running worse.
&gt; SO, at this point, after 4 hours of pricey work, the shop owner suggests we
cool our jets a bit, step back, and re-asses the situation.  His thoughts...
maybe take off the plenum, sugmerge it in water and pressurize it to find the
leak.  Maybe a &quot;smoke test&quot;.  Also, possibly try a new AFM due to the fact
that it was running _so_ badly.  He says it is hard to find a replacement
plenum, since most are from models with an EGR (my Cal bus has no EGR), which
are quite different.
&gt; Any suggestions?  Where do I go from here?  This has been haunting me for
months now!  Anyone ever heard of a leak from the plenum itself?

I seriously doubt the plenum itself is leaking. The plenum is made of thin
metal. It sounds like it is leaking but in reality, you are hearing the air
move in it.

 Is that 6% with a cat on it?
What is your timing set at, at idle?

 I may be able to find you another plenum Saturday. But I don't think you need
one.
Is the 'running worse now' at idle or down the road?
