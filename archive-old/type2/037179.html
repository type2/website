Chad, I would be interested in hearing about any information that might
come your way.  I live in Kansas, but would like to hit some bus campouts
this summer in Colorado myself.

The only campout I have heard about is the one sponsored by the Colorado
bus club July 14 - 16.  I think it ends with a cruise to Blackhawk.

I hadn't heard of any, but wondered if there was a campout  during the
Rocky Mountain and Denver Fineline shows.

Please let me know if you hear of any more.
