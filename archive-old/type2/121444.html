Subject: Re: [T2] Yokohama Snow Performance?

George,
These tires only have lateral grooves cut into them ( sipes ) --nothing
all all to relieve water pressure, or disperse the water away or from
under the contact patch--
This is why I had my Yokomama's cut--to help this inherent problem with
this tire.

My body may be getting older--but my mind is still 16--
I like running WFO--or as close to it as possible anyway.

Later,

TK


 
The wet weather handling is poor--- 

Although I'm not exactly in the wet weather capital of the world, I do
get to drive in the rain now and then. I'm surprised that some folks who
drive buses actually explore the wet weather limits of the tires. Bus
tires are small and heavily loaded, so they should be less prone to
hydroplane than the wider and lightly-loaded tires of other cars. 
I guess I'm just getting old! :) 

George
