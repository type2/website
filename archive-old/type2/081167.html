Subject: Re: [T2] Manual trans fluid

One other thing I neglected to mention: API category MT-1 was issued in 1995.
If you read the pdf on GL-4 from Pennzoil, it is dated July, 1995. As big a
company as Pennzoil/Quaker Sludge
is [and now they are owned by Shell] you have to believe that if MT-1 was the
latest and greatest thing to happen to GL-4, then they would have made a
reference to it!! Not one word is said.

And that link to carcare/faq?
http://www.pennzoil_dot_com/carcare/faq/default.htm#top
Scroll down to the bottom. copywrite 2001!!!!
Read thru all of it. Look for MT-1 anywhere....... nope, not there.

I just went back to the Chevron link Jamie sent. Under the section of
applications it says:

&quot;Applications

These lubricants are excellent for all types of automotive and industrial
bearings and gears, particularly those operating under severe temperature and
load conditions. They are suitable for top-off of limited slip differentials.
They provide excellent wear control even in the presence of small amounts of
water.

Their exceptional thermal and oxidation stability, and antiwear performance
permit longer gear life and extended drain intervals.

Chevron Delo Gear Lubricants ESI are the only nonsynthetic gear oils approved
for the 750,000-mile extended warranty program in Dana/Spicer axles (see Eaton
PS-037).

Chevron Delo Gear Lubricant ESI SAE 80W-90 is the only nonsynthetic gear oil
approved for extended service in Meritor (formerly Rockwell) axles for 500,000
mile oil drains.&quot;

NOWHERE is transmission mentioned! Only gearsets and axles and limited slip
differentials.
Pick up a bottle of any gear oil that is not marked GL-4. On the front it will
say GL-5 and 'for manual transmissions'.  Read the fine print on the back.
Usually it says something like &quot;this gear oil is suitable for any transmission
that requires GL-5&quot;. The key word there is 'requires'. A VW transmission is
not designed to use GL-5.

&gt; I have stayed away from this discussion until I could find the name brand
&gt; product that advertises their wonder pus contains the latest and greatest
&gt; thing since sliced bread:  MT-1. But on the container it says: &quot;Do not use
in
&gt; manual transmissions&quot;. But I have struck out all week. It seems to have been
&gt; removed from the market.
&gt; So instead, I will send you here:
&gt;
http://www.lubrizol_dot_com/ReadyReference/DrivelineLubricants/15-gears/default.ht
&gt; m
&gt; Scroll down to API Category MT-1 and read it. The second paragraph is very
&gt; interesting. I will paste it here:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;API Category MT-1
&gt;
&gt; Numerous performance specifications can be used to identify the level of
&gt; protection that will be provided by an automotive gear lubricant. In the
past,
&gt; API Category GL-4 was commonly used to describe the type of lubricants that
&gt; would provide acceptable performance in manual transmissions and lightly
&gt; loaded final drive axles. API Category GL-5 described lubricants that were
&gt; generally used in final drive axles operating in moderate to severe service.
&gt; However, several new performance specifications are becoming the benchmark
for
&gt; describing lubricant quality.
&gt;
&gt; API Category MT-1, which was issued in 1995, describes the performance
&gt; requirements of lubricants intended for use in non-synchronized manual
&gt; transmissions, such as those found in heavy-duty trucks and buses.
Lubricants
&gt; meeting the requirements of API Category MT-1 provide protection against the
&gt; combination of thermal degradation, component wear, and oil seal
&gt; deterioration, which is not provided by lubricants meeting only the
&gt; requirements of API GL-1 through GL-5.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Keep reading the sentance that says &quot; Category MT-1, which was issued in
1995,
&gt; describes the performance requirements of lubricants intended for use in
&gt; non-synchronized manual transmissions, such as those found in heavy-duty
&gt; trucks and buses&quot;  and remember that ALL bay window buses have synchros.
&gt;
&gt; If you click on the MT-1 link in the 2nd paragraph, it takes you to a chart.
&gt; Nothing in that chart mentions any test for GL4. It does mention ASTM D-130
&gt; and it says: &quot;Stability in the presence of copper and copper alloys&quot; but NON
&gt; synchro transmissions would not have copper or brass or bronze alloys. The *
&gt; says  &quot;ASTM copper corrosion requirement is more severe for API MT-1and
&gt; MIL-PRF-2105E/SAE J2360 than in MIL-L-2105D.&quot; But I have not figured out
what
&gt; they mean by that. But D and E do not apply to a VW transaxle.
&gt; The 68-79 Bentley does not specify the MIL requirement but the 80-85 Vanagon
&gt; Bentley does for the 091 trans which almost the same as a late bay trans.
The
&gt; transaxle lubricant listed is API GL-4, MIL-L-2105. The differential in the
&gt; auto trans requires API GL-5, MIL-L2105B. As far as I can find, these have
not
&gt; been superceded by C, or D, or E etc.
&gt;
&gt; Here is some info from Pennzoil:
&gt;
&gt;
http://www.pennzoil_dot_com/TechData/Pdsheet/DomesticMarketing/Gear&amp;Transmission/p
&gt; df/GL-4GearLubricant.PDF
&gt; Yes, they specifically make GL-4 for among other vehicles, Volkswagen!
&gt;
&gt; Here is another paragraph from another Pennzoil site:
&gt; http://www.pennzoil_dot_com/carcare/faq/default.htm#4
&gt;
&gt; &quot;2. What happens if API GL-5 gear oil is used in an API GL-4 gear oil
&gt; application?
&gt;
&gt; API GL-4 and API GL-5 products typically use the same extreme pressure (EP)
&gt; additive system, with the API GL-5 having about twice the concentration of a
&gt; API GL-4. In service, these additives become active under extreme load and
&gt; temperature when the protective oil film can be squeezed away. EP additives
&gt; work by forming wear-resistant compounds with the metal of the gear tooth
&gt; surface. As the gears mesh, these compounds shield the gear teeth from
direct
&gt; metal-to-metal contact that would cause wear and damage to the gears. If too
&gt; little of the active additive is present, proper protection would be
&gt; compromised. Too much of this additive could cause excessive chemical
&gt; corrosion of the gear surface. If an API GL-5 gear oil is used in a
&gt; application where API GL-4 gear oil is called for, chemical corrosion of
&gt; &quot;yellow metal&quot; components may occur, such as bronze synchronizers, brass
&gt; bushings, etc. This may lead to shifting difficulties or shortened equipment
&gt; life.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Bottom line? Straight GL-4 or Redline MT90. I cannot find any truth to any
of
&gt; the MT-1 mumbo jumbo. I wish I could find the product that says it is MT-1
but
&gt; do not use it in a manual trans. Sorry. I have looked for it all week. It
was
&gt; out there.....

&gt; &gt; Hi Jim
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well,, if the link I provided before wasn't good enough,, then I can't say
&gt; any
&gt; &gt; more,,,,
&gt; &gt; other than no apparent troubles in my Vw .....
&gt; &gt; I think the key words in this spec sheet are &quot;inorganic borate compound&quot;
...
&gt; &gt; what can I say,,  works for me,, do you have reason to believe the mfg.
&gt; would
&gt; &gt; specifically lie to me ??
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i did some research, and come up with a fluid I was told is OK for the
&gt; Vw
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trans even though it has a GL-5 rating,,,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 80w-90 Chevron Delo Gear Lubricant ESI  API service GL-4 / GL-5 / MT-1
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I thought I'd pass it on to see if anyone has comments ??
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Who told you that? If this isn't synthetic gear lube and it has a GL-5
&gt; &gt; &gt; rating, it contains the synchro-eating additives.
