Subject: RE: CO too high with dual carbs

Chris,

I'm no expert so I'll copy this to the list in the hope that someone more
knowledgable will give you the information you need :-)
If your CO is only slightly off, you should be able to get it in range by
adjusting the small idle mixture screw, then adjust the idle speed back
again.  I've not had to do anything else to mine so I don't know the
procedure if this doesn't get it in spec.  I assume you know the carbs need
to be balanced first.

&gt; I just failed my emissions inspection because the carbon monoxide 
&gt; was a few tenths of a percentage point too high. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have a type IV engine with dual PDSITs. I am not familiar with
&gt; these carbs. Which adjustment should I make to lower the CO?
&gt; Should I go through the entire tune up procedure, or will a simple
&gt; slight adjustment lower the readings?
