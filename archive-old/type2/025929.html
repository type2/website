Hello all,

Sometime very soon, after over two months at the repair shop, my '78 bus
with a basic camper conversion will be ready for the summer. I had to have
the engine rebuilt, among other things, and that is what has caused the
long, but no doubt worthwhile, delay. I have been equally as long curious to
know what I can expect out of a rebuilt engine. This is my first bus (and
first ACVW in about 10 years) and I haven't even driven it yet so I don't
even have a drive to the repair shop to go on. I will, of course, talk with
the repair shop and try to get an idea of what I can expect out of her, but
I am curious to hear from those who have had an engine rebuilt. If the
repair shop does good work (the repair shop I took it to has 30 years of
aircooled experience and a good rep to go with that so I'm assuming they
do), is a rebuilt engine basically as good as a new one, minus the luster?
Is there any proper way to &quot;break in&quot; a rebuilt engine? Is there anything I
should be on the lookout for in the first weeks of driving it? Also, and I
should have discussed this with the repair shop in advance, but is it
reasonable to expect some sort of mileage guarantee out of a rebuilt engine?
And, lastly, can I drive it from NY to California without worrying about
anything more than an oil change? =p

Any reports/anecdotes/tips would be must humbly appreciated.

Thanks!

Steve
