&gt; Boogered is such a good word.  With Steves extensive vocabulary, which I
&gt; know he has, I am sure he could have used some other word, but he chose
&gt; &quot;boogered&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that says a lot about this man, and my good brother.

You said it right, Charlie. Steve IS a man of words, and the word 'boogered'
covers a lot of ground with it's simplicity. I'll bet he chose it wisely.
