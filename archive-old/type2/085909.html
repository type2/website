Subject: Re: [T2] VWOA Trademark Licensing Program


I am finding this more and more disturbing, myself.  It is like the record 
companies wanting to charge for every copy of a song on a CD that you 
already paid royalties on, or Microsoft wanting to copyright the word 
'Windows'.  Companies are realizing that they have pretty well saturated the 
marketplace the most they are able, and are looking for new ways to get 
extra revenues without offering new services or products. &quot;We won't sell or 
carry any more aircooled parts, but we really DO love you guys, so why don't 
you pay us to use the VW logo on your shopfront window.  Oh, and if you 
don't, we'll sue the pants off of you.  Want to test-drive a new Passat?&quot;  
Robber-Barons.
