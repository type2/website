Bet it's your booster. Make sure your hoses are hooked up. Also, there's
a little one-way valve in that line that may have gone bad (it prevents
backfire from blowing out your booster diaphgragm). I understand someone
has replaced it with a general PCV valve from an American car smog
system. I try to find them at junkyards where I can.

You check the valve by -- ew -- blowing gently in each end. It should be
easy to blow the way the arrow goes, but harder against the arrow.

The hose it's in is steel-reinforced and a bitch to get off. AMHIK.
