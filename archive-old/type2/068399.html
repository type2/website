Placing his tongue gently, but firmly within his cheek, Steve Dolan saith:

Now Ken, &lt;he said with a note of mock stern-ness in his voice&gt;

Leave others to their otherness(1)*.  *I* just bought a '76 Westy for the
simple reason that it did *not* come with a pop-top.  Not that I needed
another bus, not that I wanted another bus, not that I could afford
another bus, not even that I have a place to *keep* another bus; just that
I thought a non-pop top Westy was a cool idea.  Remember that
rationalizations are more important than sex (have you ever tried to get
throught a week without a rationalization? :-).

As I think of it, a bicycle is a *way* cooler idea than a non-pop-top
Westy. As a matter of fact, thinking further, it is almost as cool as my
dream car, a diesel transplanted into a Syncho Westfalia. Just think, a
car qualified to drag race with Thom Fitzpatrick, but 30 years younger:-)!

Of course the Harlequin is nearly as neat.  I saw one at my FLVWD(2) and
asked the shop manager if it was the body shop's idea of the perfect car.
Yes, he said, no matter what gets dinged, you can get a replacemment part
from the nearest junk yard and you don't even have to repaint!

qualifies, for a wonder!)
