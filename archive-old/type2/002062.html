.. anyone have a good trick that holds
+AD4-up for resealing the rusty gap between the sheet metal and the in/out spots
+AD4-of the exhaust  pipe?

John,

I don't know how good this is going to work out, but my he's are in poor
shape, and I dont want the bother of pulling the engine just yet. I've just
gone and got a roll of closing tape from a plumbers merchants. Cost about
+ACQ-10 for 25 metres, so it'll seal a lot of busses. This stuff is what they
use for sealing the gap between back of a gas boiler and the flue, so it
should stand some high temperatures.

I'll report later on how successful it is.
