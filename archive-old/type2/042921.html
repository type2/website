Subject: i need some advice......

this is my first post here.   up until now i've only owned one vw, and that 
is the 1970 squareback i am currently driving.  but i happened to stumble 
across an ad in the local paper about a '78 bus for sale, $600 obo, needs 
work.  i had a good feeling about it, so i went and checked it out.  my 
feeling was right on. the bus is owned by a gentleman of about 80 who has 
had the bus for 13 years and is the second owner.  the body shows minimal 
rust for an east coast vehicle, the floors are solid, it is inspected (thus 
legal in all aspects), and the engine and interior are both in very nice 
condition.

the catch:  the engine won't stay running.  by this i mean it starts right 
up every time, but as soon as the foot is taken off the gas the engine 
stalls out.  the owner told me that he spent over $400 on a new fuel pump, 
fuel pump relay, and air flow sensor.  and it still won't stay running.  now 
i know he didn't take the bus to a good dealer, i called the mechanic and he 
really didn't know what he was talking about.  but i know how the fuel 
injection in vw's can be through direct experience with my fi squareback.  
it could be something very simple.

so i need advice on what to check out.  i really don't know anything about 
this fuel injection system since it varies considerably from the system on 
my square.  someone told me to check the EGR valve.  any tips?

they are willing to go down to $400 for this van, that's a deal right?

thanks in advance for any help....

mark.
