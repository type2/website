Hey Harmon...

I find this thread fascinating as I'm dealing with it myself right now
with my 71 bus.  

I'm a bit puzzled with the various opinions on the list concerning the
value of air flowing through the engine compartment, over the cylinder
heads, etc.  Some say that this air has very little to do with cooling the
engine, that the significant cooling occurs with proper air/fuel mixture,
good oil, etc.  

Now I don't have any doubt that the above affects the heating/cooling of
the engine.  But the engine and hence this list are &quot;air cooled&quot; lists.
And a previous post today made a good point in the lack of unnecessary
items in the design of the engine.  Why would VW design an &quot;air cooled&quot;
engine with flaps whose presence or absence makes no difference in the
ability of the engine to cool itself?  Granted, the thermostatic system
improves warm up time, but is that the end of the system's utility?

&gt;From a physics standpoint, any air flowing over the engine that is from a
cooler source (outside) would draw heat from the warmer source (engine),
hence cooling the engine.  Is this a negligible amount of heat?  I don't
know.  My guess is that it's a significant amount of heat and that
constantly changing the air in the engine compartment is a critical
component in cooling the engine.  But that is a guess.  

I mention this only because I think my bus either has the flaps removed or
they are stuck shut, because when I open the lid to the engine
compartment after the engine is warm, it is extremely hot.  Very hot.  And
my oil temp gauge reads 240 after 10 minutes of highway driving...  I'm
running 10w30 (soon changing to 30w), air/fuel mixture is per bentley
specs (3 turns out from bottom) on the 34pict3, and all my tin is in
place.  Oil pressure control and relief valves have all been checked to
make sure they are in working order and are not stuck, and my timing is at
5 deg atdc (per muir, bentley, and haynes) with a stock dizzy with vacuum
advance (one vacuum hose to the left port on the carb and the other to
the exhaust manifold)...

All of this and my oil temp is still through the roof.  I feel like I keep
filling in pieces of the overheating puzzle and the problem still remains.
The only thing that hasn't been done yet is pull the engine to get the
flaps and thermostat working...

So I feel like the air is important to the cooling, but my lack of
experience in working on these engines and the opposing views on the
significance of &quot;air cooled&quot; make this a puzzling problem indeed...

Hmmmm..
