Subject: Re: [T2] vw recyclers in NC ??

You can try the Bug Shoppe in Holly Ridge, between J'ville &amp; Wilmington.
Phone # is 1-910-329-0022. I know he has several old bugs and buses at
his shop. He also has another location in SC I think. 
As a side note, he has inside his shop an unrestored '52 Beetle.
Good Luck,
Jim
