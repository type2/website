Subject: HELP Cv won't rotate

Ok
So I pick up my used cv and tear it down, cleaning it well.
It looks good. I re- assemble and pack the grease in. It
is at this point I realize that it won't rotate. As in
rotating on it's verticle axis to accept the angle of the
tranny. I tried assembly and reassembly but to no avail.
Please send any ideas. Thanks
