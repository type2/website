Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Temperatures

I just bought a Raytek handheld with a backlit display and all for $10 at a 
garage sale. Even came with a good set of batteries. Seems to be very 
accurate. Also a good tool for pointing at your wife and proclaiming 
&quot;You're hot stuff!&quot; and pointing at your sleeping kiddo and saying &quot;he's 
out cold...&quot;.

I hear that Radio Shack has something similar for around $50 but I have not 
checked up on it.


&gt;It's a small handheld Cooper brand remote IR sensor with a laser spotter and
&gt;a digital readout. I paid about $65 for mine, and I got it on eBay. When I
&gt;first bought it, it was more of a toy than anything else, and I didn't
&gt;really know what I would do with it.. I kicked myself for being frivolous
&gt;and wasteful. But it happens that I soon bought the second of our buses on
&gt;eBay shortly thereafter, and it was up in Couer d' Alene, ID (We are in Los
&gt;Angeles), with a blown engine. We took a turnkey engine up there in the
&gt;first bus, installed it in a day, and camped on the 1,600 mile trip back.
&gt;Thankfully, I had the foresight to pack the little remote IR sensor..
&gt;Nothing eventful happened on that trip with either bus, but that sensor gave
&gt;me a lot of peace of mind, because we went through some really KILLER heat
&gt;on the way back through southwestern Utah and through Las Vegas. We were
&gt;able to check our engines ACTUAL temperature at every stop.
&gt;The IR remote sensor also made for many fun science projects, comparing the
&gt;engine temperatures between the two vehicles in different conditions (almost
&gt;identical at all times), different locales on the engines, and we even used
&gt;this thing to measure the temperatures of thermal features in Yellowstone
&gt;National Park!.. 100% ecologically safe, other than the AA batteries needed!
&gt;If you want to get one for yourself, you might try eBay, or I have heard
&gt;that Radio Shack just came out with such a unit. There are also huge devices
&gt;that do the same job but look like a policeman's speed gun. I would avoid
&gt;those, unless you're trying to impress someone. But the little handheld is
&gt;about the size of a banana or sweet potato, and it is very, very cool!   Jan
