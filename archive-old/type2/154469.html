That I do not know.  I have not installed a Dakota so I am not sure if the
pods that the VDO use would be the right size.  I have seen one in a picture
that was placed in the dash right next to the speedometer.  But that was a
long time ago.

I just got off the phone, I ordered a Dakota Digital Odyssey II CHT...
I was gonne get the Solarix, but they were out of the black ones...
He said they are identical, but the display colors are slightly
different....

Any thoughts on the best gauge pod to use on a 78 Westy???
I like the rounded style but could only find the above dash models, will
they work below dash as well?

Thanks again...

&gt; Hi there:  I was just surfing/reading this section of Ratwell.
&gt; http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/FAQ.html If you go to the section 9 it
&gt; will
&gt; tell you all about gauges and Dakota.
