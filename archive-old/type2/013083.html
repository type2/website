Subject: Friday Topic: Bus Fridges
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id QAA34844

So, I'm looking for an affordable, 12V DC (DC-only) refrigerator for
my bus, and the ones I've found are all too bloody expensive ($600-800+),
even for the really inefficient ones (80+ amp-hours/day).  The reason I'm
looking for DC only is that I've heard that DC-only compressors, as 
opposed to
3-way or otherwise, are much more energy efficient, and that's my main
concern.

So, that said, has anyone tried out any of Koolatron's Coolers?  They've
got a 52-quart chest cooler that's 12V DC and the &quot;right&quot; price: $185

Here's the cooler:
http://www.koolatron_dot_com/electronics/kool5212vcoo.html

which is said to &quot;cool to 48°F below the outside temperature.&quot;
(basically all I would need/want it to do)

Furthermore, their technical FAQ (http://www.koolatron_dot_com/faq.html)
  says that it only pulls 3 amps/hour _at_12V.   While this isn't great
and while it doesn't have any control circuit/thermostat (as far as I 
can tell),
that's still not too bad for $185, and, worst case scenario, I can either
rig my own thermostat/control system or just put it on a timer (if I'm
in a low power situation).


So yeah, has anyone tried out one of these babies?  They seem like the
cat's meow for the price...
