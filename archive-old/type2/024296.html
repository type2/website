Hi... sorry if this is an inappropriate response... I'm new here. I can't figure out how to e-mail you directly, but I'm looking for a 78 camper in WA state, so yours could be it! Could you please e-mail me a picture?

My e-mail is hall_at_dungeness_dot_com
My phone number is 360-681-2076. We're on the Olympic Peninsula, but would be very happy to make a trip to Seattle for the right bus.

Thanks.

Hall
