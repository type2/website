&gt; So, I (reluctantly) pulled the nicely glued case apart, and with half
&gt; the case open, attached the flywheel and had endplay!?!?!  I don't get
&gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm wondering if somehow the no. 1 bearing got offset because there was
&gt; definately a high point where it was hitting the flywheel.
&gt; 
&gt; I dunno.. I guess I'll be doing a trial fitting WITHOUT glue.
&gt; plastigauge would have been handy..
&gt; 
&gt; Besides this bearing thingie, this engine is going together
&gt; beautifully.  Rimco did a very nice job on the machining.  All the rods
&gt; and pistons were balanced to the tenth of an ounce.. not bad!  Tomorrow
&gt; I'm bringing my fan and clutch disk to be balanced (forgot to bring 'em
&gt; earlier) along with having them rethread my oil cover plate thread..
&gt; stripped the little sucker!

Mike,

How many shims did you have installed when you checked end float? You should
have had TWO. Then you do the math and find what shim you need to give the
right amount of end float. It is completely possible to have zero end play
with three shims, depending on variables like what size the shims are, what
was done to the engine internals etc.

As an aside, you have to be philosophical about taking the crankcase apart
once it is together. These things happen when building engines. Sometimes it
takes a few tries to get it all perfect. It will probably happen a few more
times before you are done. Once a guy in our local club told me he usually
rebuilds an engine in a weekend. &quot;A weekend?&quot;, I said?! I was in disbelief -
&quot;it takes me months&quot;, I said. Turns out he wasn't really rebuilding, just
taking off the heads and putting on new rings. You get what you pay for, in
terms of time invested, so don't worry if you have a few false starts, it is
all part of the process.
