&gt; Despite your cash woes, try to buy a second cable right now...  Get a
throttle cable too.  They aren't that expensive.

Will do.  I'll also get under him and see if there's anything doable in the
mean time.

&gt; Somewhat related but did someone already mention to check the transmission
&gt; fluid level?

Haynes doesn't show where the plug is or what is needed to remove it... like
y'all didn't know that... help?

Just for the record, I've run into a problem that I didn't have 2 decades
ago with my first bus.  Almost every time I park the bus someone comes up to
admire it and talk 60's/70's (in spite of the sadly PO neglected body)!  One
guy even followed me home to ask about Giacomo and to talk about his own
bus!!!  Totally cool. :O)

One dear fellow mentioned that he use to have a number of VW's (seemed like
the whole family had their own bus/beetle), and now no longer needs his VW
tools and books.  Service manuals, VW-specific specialty tools, even a work
bench-mounted engine frame.  I made an offer to purchase it all from him,
and he's going to get it all together and think about a price.  Nice.  I'll
list the goodies when I find out what they are.
