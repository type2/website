Subject: Going up north next week

Hello all

Next week (June 12th) I will be heading from Reno NV
to Seattle in my 79 Westy to pick up my wife from the
airport on the 15th and off we go to British
Columbia/Vancouver Island to hike the West Coast Trail
starting on the 18th. We plan on taking anywhere from
four to six weeks up in B.C. traveling around with no
destination in mind. 

We are getting help from listee Chuck
Meanley(spelling?) at Lake Cowichan BC. Thanks so much
Chuck!

Two things...

Anything VW going on up north on the weekend of the
13/14/15th in the Seattle area.

Does anybody have anything that needs delivery from
this area to Portland/Seattle/Vancouver Island??
