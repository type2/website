Ian,

I have only one thing to say ..... :-(

We're gonna miss you!  If you do come to the english-speaking country with
the most people (not sheep, people :) please do drop in!!!  Free tours of
Washington, DC are a specialty, and I have an empty guest bedroom :-)

                           H Steven Dolan
