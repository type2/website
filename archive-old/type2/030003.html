the shift linkage doesnt have any ball bearings.  Unless you condider the
ball and socket at the bottom of the shifter a ball bearing.


&gt; people have said it could be then clutch, but I'd like to try the path

Indeed this DOES sound like the clutch.  An ungreased shift linkage might
be hard to move..but it wont grind.  (bad/missing bushings cause cause it
to grind though.)

you're quickest and easiest solution would be to ADJUST your clutch.  I'd
be willing to bet that you have much more then the recommended .5-1 inch
of play at the top of your clutch pedal.


A quick look in /any/ aircooled VW maintenance book will give you plenty
of information on how to do this. Or check the archives.
