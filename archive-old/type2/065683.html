Subject: 1979 exhausts

I've dug out my catalogue for &quot;JUST KAMPERS&quot; a UK company who advertise a 
worldwide mail order service.

They sale some stuff that some of you folks in USA may be interested in. 
Including 79 only heat exchangers!

Prices are in UK pounds from the 1996 catalogue and include VAT (sales tax) at
17.5% which would be knocked off for an export sale. Delivery charge extra.
