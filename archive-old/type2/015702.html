&gt;I went to David's site on the electric bus he owns, and was reading the
&gt;manual, when I came upon a paragraph applicable to the spring plate
&gt;adjustment question:
&gt;
&gt;Note the statement that coil-over shockes were used on these vans, and
&gt;installed by VW!  So VW must have thought that they could prevent sagging
&gt;by using them.  A separate post had stated that the coil over shocks
&gt;caused breakage of the mounts, and I would be interested to see if the
&gt;mounts were reinforced by the factory.  

I would be interested to know that too.  

A friend of mine bought a '73 bus a few years ago with coil over springs on
the rear, and the passenger side top shock mount was broken off!  I didn't
really think about why until this subject was brought up on the list some
time ago.  

Nevertheless, I put coilovers on my bus since the rear end was sagging, and
it raised my rear bumper 1&quot;.  Doesn't sound like much but it made a huge
difference in the way the bus looks, and I have had no problems in several
years, including some offroad excursions and horrendous potholes.

Now one of the coilover shocks has leaked all of it's fluid out, and is
doing nothing.  I have decided to get the KYB gas shocks from Bus Depot for
the rear and I just bought an adjustable coil-over kit which I am going to
install over them.  The old coilovers were one piece (i.e. the coilovers
were welded to the shocks) so I have to replace the whole thing.  I'd be
interested in hearing comments from anyone who has installed these
adjustable springs.  I'm not going to adjust them too tight to protect the
upper shock mounts.
