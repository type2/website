&gt; I wouldn't attempt this alone if it's your first time.  I

I have a transmission jack that I made a cradle for that holds my 2liter
engine.  got it from Harbor Freight and it allows me to remove and install
my engine solo.

&gt; definitely want some help reinstalling.  I've said this before,

well depends on what you hope your future relationship with your wife will

&gt; Not THAT easy, a 2.0 liter FI engine is a little tight, don't
&gt; forget to remove the rear tin and coil.  Jack that sucker
&gt; up good 'n high (secured safely with jack stands of course.)
&gt; Just go slow and make sure you clear the tranny input
&gt; shaft (this is where another set of eyes helps.)
&gt; 
&gt; You don't have to remove the mustache bar (rear support) 
&gt; from the engine, so just the 4 mounts to the tranny, then
&gt; 2 bolts on either end of the mustache bar.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, just follow the Bentley, but you can ignore
&gt; the part about supporting the tranny (so I've been told.)

yep I don't support the tranny unless I'm removing it
