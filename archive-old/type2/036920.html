&gt; Aircraft conversions of VW engines sometimes use Bing CV carburators with

&gt; the problem is in fabricating the manifolds and fitting the whole works

this fabrication would be very easy i think... at least on a single port

take single port intake manifolds cut the center out to the point where
you have a horizontal tube just long enough to be fully horizontal.

rotate or swap side to side so that the horizontal bit points out instead
of in.

Weld on your carb mounting plates.

the linkage, hmm that might present a problem...

just a thought,
