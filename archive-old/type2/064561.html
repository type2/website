Subject: The Inuvik Run -- Back to Dawson

The Inuvik Run -- Dawson Again

3 &amp; 4 August

My log reads: &quot;3 Aug '96, 91847, 279.2.  Arrive Dawson&quot;  I was
too busy or too tired to write more.

Shortly after leaving the Engineer Creek campground Sue had a
flat.  Caught in deep gravel, she ran on the sidewall before
realizing she'd lost a tire.  By the time she stopped, the tire
was toast.  Her tire tools were buried, a common error among the
trekkies.  My floor jack and tire tools were immediately to hand
in the cargo bay and I set about changing her tire.  I believe in
sexual equality but I also believe in common sense; my changing
the tire would save time.

On Sue Booth's diesel vanagon the spare tire is fastened in a
fitted well behind the front bumper.  (I think all Vanagons use
the same arrangement.)  When the van took its short flight off
the road the landing did some minor damage to the spare tire
retainer, a metal pan as large as the tire itself.  I had to dig
out some tools and bend things back into shape before I could
unbolt the retainer.

Once the tire was changed and the damaged tire put in the
retainer, I had to use the floor jack to raise the retainer high
enough to engage the threads of the fastener.  The task requires
that you lay on your side in the roadway.  From start to finish,
it took about an hour to change the wheel.  

Just after leaving the campground a Dodge van conversion about
the size of a Eurovan but painted up like a Russian jetliner shot
past heading north.  They were clipping along at seventy -- mph,
not klicks --  having a hell of a fine time.  Mag wheels.  Tinted
windows.  Spiffy paint job.  California plates.  They gave an
airy wave and peppered us with gravel as they flew past.

As I was finishing with Sue's tire we saw the California van
creeping toward us at a sensible 40mph.  Their spiffy paint job
was clotted with mud.  They asked if we needed help.  We didn't
but they wanted to chat.  They'd encountered one of the bad
patches and had a blow-out at speed, eating both the tire and the
fancy mag wheel.  They were still a bit wired from the event,
which was so exciting they decided they'd seen enough of the
Dempster.  Their heavily laden van was fitted with passenger-car
tires.  The tires were attractive, if you like that sort of
thing.  Bold raised letters read 'Grippers' or 'Grabbers', the
meaningless horseshit used to sell things to Yuppies.  But the
fine print on the tires said they were only two-ply.  From their
profile they looked to be seriously overloaded or underinflated.

The Dempsters unique arrowhead-sharp shale gravel cost me another
flat just north of North Fork Pass, my third.  I didn't notice
the puncture until we were well into the pass, up near the three
thousand foot level.  I pulled off near the rest stop at the top
of the pass.  The wind was strong enough to rock the bus.  It
wasn't snowing but the raindrops had little chunkies in the
middle.  Sue took advantage of the stop to take her dog for a run
across the tundra.  By the time I got the tire swapped I was
chilled to the bone, my hands a mottled purple.  

One of the modifications I made to the bus for the trip is a
little shelf behind the front seat to hold the video monitor.  On
the second day of the trip I moved the monitor to a more secure
location on the new shelves built over the passenger-seat area.  

Cold, wet and muddy, after changing the tire I crept into the
cockpit, started the engine and plugged in an immersion heater. 
I soon had a big cup of boiling water, into which I poured my
last packet of instant cocoa.  I stirred it carefully.  I was
running the engine about two thousand rpm but with the blustery
wind and showers of cold rain the cockpit was pretty cold -- I
was lusting after that cocoa.  

Sue Booth trotted up, hair soaked, cheeks, nose and ears crimson
from the cold.  She made an appealing gesture toward the back of
the bus and I nodded.  Her diesel is water cooled and has a
better heater than my bus but the diesel had been sitting for
half an hour whereas my engine was producing at least a little
heat.  She jumped in back, letting in a blast of cold air.  She
sat rubbing her hands, telling me how cold it was, stomping the
mud off her boots.  

As the last step in preparing The cup of cocoa that would save my
life, I stirred in some condensed milk, sat the cup aside on the
little shelf, used the freed space to dig out a bagel.  

&quot;Gee.  Thanks!&quot;

My 1965 Microbus is not a walk-thru.  The little table is on the
back of the front seat.  Sue was hunkered on the folded up bunk,
trying to get warm.  The little table was right in front of her
nose.  When I sat down the steaming cup she thought I was
offering it to her.  She scooped it up and took a grateful swig.

My look must of given me away.  Either that or my scream of rage. 
She stammered an apology and tried to give back the cup, licking
a guilty rime of cocoa from her upper lip.  I insisted I really
meant for her to have it, that I much preferred coffee and was in
the process of making some.  But it didn't ring true.  The cup
contained not only my last packet of cocoa, it held the last of
my water.  And the jar of instant coffee happened to be in the
steel box I use for a larder, tucked under the edge of the bunk. 
Sue was sitting on it.

When a cup of steaming coffee failed to materialize Sue got the
sequence worked out and despite trying not to, began to laugh. 
After a minute, so did I.  Huddled with cold, smelling of damp
dog, flat tire and wet wool, we passed the cup back and forth
until the cocoa was gone.  Oddly, it was one of the more pleasant
moments of the trip.  And one of the funniest.

The Dempster follows the north fork of the Klondike River south
from the pass some forty miles to the intersection with the
highway.  The Klondike River campground where we would again be
staying is about ten miles beyond.  Dawson City another ten to
the west.  At the junction we stopped to use the restrooms (Hot
water!).  To atone for the cocoa, Sue bought me a cup of coffee
and we talked about buses.  She expressed surprise that my bus
was so warm.  Her propane regulator is broken so she has no stove
in her Vanagon, the inside of which reaches ice-box temperatures
shortly after shutting off the engine.  I've insulated my bus,
even plastering cow-pies of urethane foam to the ceiling.  If
there's no wind, two candles plus the heat of my body is
sufficient to keep the interior temperature in the comfort zone.

At Dawson the big maintenance item for the bus was getting rid of
the layers of mud.  After repairing my latest flat I spent eight
loonies on the pressure washer, blasting mud from the chassis and
engine.  I didn't bother doing the body until I noticed streaks
of mud coming from the rain gutter.  On closer inspection I saw
my rain gutters were filled level with mud.

I used the Dawson layover to unload the bus, cleaning and
repacking the contents for the run home.  I hung my bedding out
to air then scrubbed dead mosquitos from the inside of the
windscreen and swept the interior.

I had changed my oil, done a lube job and adjusted my link pins
at Inuvik, there wasn't any maintenance required at Dawson.  But
I crawled under and checked things out.  Having the underside of
the bus clean made it a snap to inspect the chassis, fuel tanks
and running gear.  The thirty-one year old bus showed little
evidence of having traveled nearly a thousand miles off pavement. 
The front suspension needed lubrication, the dust having drawn
gobs of lube from the joints, and there was considerable road-
rash on the U-frame and rear bumper but overall the Dempster had
done little too hurt the old bus.  The taped headlights survived,
as did the windscreen, save for a single chip, acquired when the
Insane Family cut in front of me.  

The lack of damage to the windscreen was not by luck alone. 
Whenever possible I came to a stop when being passed by any
vehicle traveling faster than I considered wise.  All vehicles
threw up some gravel, and a lot of it was bound to hit the nose
of the bus.  To lessen the hazard, just as the vehicle passed I
would make a sharp cut toward the shoulder, putting the
windscreen at a very steep angle to any flying stones.  Some
rocks hit the glass -- the sound is distinctive -- but the angle
and low velocity prevented them from doing any damage.  The rocks
thrown at me by the Insane Family hit the windscreen head-on and
at considerable velocity.  

I had three flats doing the Dempster.  In preparing for the trip
I guesstimated I would suffer one blow-out and three flats.  Not
having the money for new tires, I fitted the bus with good, used
truck tires.  To deal with the expected flats I carried a plug-
gun and 12v air compressor.  I was lucky in not having any
blowouts and in the nature of the flats, all simple punctures I
was able to deal with myself.  (Shortly after leaving home I'd
picked up a nail so my overall score was four flats for the
trip.)
  
Because I was running on used tires I carried three spares, one
more than recommended.  Having three spares allowed me to loan
one to Eddie when he suffered a blowout.  He made the trip, or at
least most of it, on passenger-car tires and with only a single
spare, which was in pretty sad shape.  He got some better rubber
under him at Whitehorse on his way home.  Swapping spares among
vehicles was pretty common during the trip but Eddie and I were
the only vans using the old-style wheels.

Sue Booth's diesel Vanagon was fitted with fairly new tires of
European spec.  After suffering the blowout she was unable to
find a matching tire and had to settle for a 195/70 as being the
closest match.  The tire, a Michelin, set her back $150 Canuck,
about what I paid for all seven of my used LT-195/75's.

After doing the Dempster the plan was to lay-over in Dawson for a
day.  The group would split here, some taking the Top of the
World Highway into Alaska, returning to Whitehorse down the
Alcan.  Sissies like me would retrace our steps down the Klondike
Highway.  Most of the people heading for Alaska stayed across the
river in Dawson, everyone else staying at the Klondike River
campground where we'd stayed before.  

The shared experience of the Dempster wrought a significant
change in our little group.  During this second stay in Dawson
there was a feeling of greater camaraderie as we congregated
around a single campfire.  We prepared communal meals and sang
silly songs, making an effort to teach Jorge &amp; Yvette the old
Kingston Trio ballad about getting Charlie off the MTA, first
having to explain what MTA meant, Puerto Rico having no subways. 
It was a good time.  Even the weather cooperated, turning colder,
reducing the mosquito population.
