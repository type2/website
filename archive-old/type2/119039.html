Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel Engine for later type 2?

&gt; No, there are quite a few.  There is a webpage
&gt; out of Germany for a shop that specializes in
&gt; this.  I remember babelfishing it.  Someone on
&gt; this list or perhaps vanagon list posted it.  I
&gt; remember it had fan boltered radiators mounted
&gt; under the belly.  Unfortunately, I've changed
&gt; computers and no longer have the link.  Anyone?  

Homepage of the shop in Germany:

http://www.birkmamero_dot_de/news.htm

The upper 16 pictures are conversions they did,
the lower not. They use vanagon diesels and
radiators mounted under the bus and in the engine
compartment. They also offer the installation of
a water/air heat-exchanger.
I still run air-cooled with a 2.0l dual-carb-setup,
but since tax for engines without catalytic converter
is beginning to get unaffordable in Germany, I'm
seriously planning in doing such a conversion.
