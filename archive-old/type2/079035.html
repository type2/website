I have a '75 1800 fuel injected engine with a severe lack of power under =
load at full or close to full throttle.
I have checked and double checked the following. Point and plug gap, =
plug wires, timing and advance.
I have strong spark at all plugs and no crack in distributor cap or plug =
wire ends. At full throttle in neutral the engine sounds like angels =
singing but when accelerating it almost dies entirely until I let up on =
throttle at which time it picks up again.I suspected fuel pump so I did =
the pressure test as described in Bently manual and the pump performed =
as it should.=20
    It occured to me that the pump has to provide more fuel under load =
than in neutral so I changed the fuel filter thinking it may be starving =
the pump of fuel under high output conditions........still not fixed.
     I would like to put a fuel pressure guage on the line and have =
someone observe it while I drive but because it is a '72 van I don't =
have an engine compartment opening inside, making this plan problematic.
    The fuel pump does make an irregular sound as opposed to a steady =
purr but my experience with these pumps is that they work or they don't.
  =20
   This van has been problem free for almost 4 years. I am getting =
terribly frustrated.  I have to drive it from Bragg Creek Alberta to =
Nanaimo B.C. at the end of february so time is of the essence .

I think/hope I need a fuel pump but they don't come cheap.
Any other ideas.

Thank for listening
Brian
