Subject: disabling EGR (was: troubleshooter for overheating)

Marvin,
On your '77, the EGR valve is controlled by a rod connected to the throttle
housing. I believe you can simply disconnect that rod. However, the valve
may still not be 100% tight, so another (or perhaps additional) measure
would be to simply plug the EGR pipe. A simple cork at one end or a blub of
silicone might work, or sandwich a piece of tin from a soda can between the
flanges where the EGR pipe meets the air intake distributor.

&gt; PO removed the EGR filter, but probably did not disable the EGR valve.
&gt; 
&gt; This may be a real problem for me. How would i go about 
&gt; disabling the EGR 
&gt; valve?
