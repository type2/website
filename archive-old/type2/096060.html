&gt; Ball valves have a seal.  Hardware store ball valves can be had that are
&gt; resistant to fuels.

I have ball valves on both sides of the ring line on my 78.

&gt; However, it would be much better to have a valve that screwed into the
&gt; outlet, because if you have hose between the valve and tank you're back to

the location is almost impossible to reach, I take the engine out and
change the fuel filter a lot more often then that custom 5,000PSI
industrial metal flex hose that I have to/from my tank does!!

also use em as security shut off switches when leaving my bus on a lot for
any length of time (like at the airport)

and super simple when the engine needs to come out or the fuel filter gets
changed.  only the fuel in the filter itself ever comes out

&gt; the same problem when the time comes to replace it.  Does the splittie
&gt; reserve valve fit on a bay?

not on a FI bay anyway
