Subject: Re: [T2] replacing windsheld and rubber together?

I had to drive my bus home from my buddies house about 10 miles in 5'oclock
traffic after we took the glass out. We had to wait for the primer to dry
and it was too late in the day to paint. It was funny to see the the double
takes people took when they looked at the bus and there was no windshield.

I froze driving back the next morning to put the windshield back in. Didn't
see any officers on the way.

&gt; &gt; I think the police would have something to say about you driving a
vehicle
&gt; with no windshield. Yes, remove the old one yourself, but have the Bus
towed
&gt; or rollbacked to the repair shop.
&gt;
&gt; I just drove mine about four miles to the glass shop.  Figured I could
talk
&gt; my way out of it if I had to.  Took small streets.
&gt;
&gt; My buddy drove his from my house in LA back home to Santa Barbara, about
90
&gt; miles, mostly on the freeway, sans glass.  Said it wasn't too bad if he
kept
&gt; the other windows closed.
&gt;
&gt; This was probably nuts.
&gt;
