My way of giving charity... 

THIS PART WILL ONLY GO TO SOMEONE IN NEED THAT CANNOT AFFORD IT

Browsing through my box of parts and forgotten goodies I can across this:

(I bought it while in Germany, but forgot what it was...Made by
BECK/WORLDPARTS, but has an instructions sheet by FAG Bremshydraulik (quality
part you know) has a number on the box 071-2679 and from my memories (I
haven't opened this box of goodies since 1990) it looks like a master cylinder
rebuild kit.

At that time of my life, I owned a 1971 Westfalia, so it may be for that year
bus, but I am not sure.

PS FREE=you must slide me a buck or two for postage to you depending where you
are.

Michael
