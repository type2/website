I just went playing in the Vanagon archives for a minute or two and this
is the oldest message in them:




Date:         Sat, 2 Apr 1994 15:01:54 -0600 (CST)
Sender:       Vanagon Mailing List &lt;vanagon_at_vanagon_dot_com&gt;
From:         Gerald Skerbitz &lt;gsker_at_lenti&gt;
Subject:      New listprocessor

This is a rather trepid announcement of my installation of the
listprocessor software.

The list is still called vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu, but you can send
help,subscribe,unsubscribe,set vanagon digest messages to
listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu

As soon as I get a welcome message together, I'll post it to the list
so you can forward it to your friends.

If there are any problems, I'll probably see them, but please send mail
to me as gsker_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu if you see them first or you need some
help with something.

Also, if you can spare a few seconds to quickly respond to this note so
I
know it got out there somewhere, that'd be nice (I can do that while the

list is still small. &lt;smile&gt;)

Thanks,
