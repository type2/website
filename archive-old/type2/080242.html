Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0L in a '70???

John Belanger sends:

&gt; Saw this one and have to ask:
&gt; 
&gt; Why? What is the major difference(s) between the '70 and say '72 setups? My
&gt; previous '72 had the 1700 T4 installed and it looked like a 2.0 would
&gt; shoehorn in there O.K..... Why convert to an upright? I can imagine there
&gt; may be some frame clearance related issues on the sides but???
&gt; 
&gt; Enquiring minds want to know....
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks and take care,
&gt; 
&gt; John B.

A 72 sold in the United States has a T4 engine, and since the 1700, the 1800
and the 2000 are all T4 engines this isn't much of a swap as far as your
&quot;legal engineering&quot; (jury- rigging) skills go.

A 70, no matter where it was sold, has a T1 engine in it--which is an
upright. Lotsa difference between the two.
