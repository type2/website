Subject: Re: '79 Engine in an '81

&gt;Okay folks,
&gt;  Say I have a '79 2.0L Engine and I want to chuck it into a lonely
&gt;engineless '81, are there any significant modifications that will be
&gt;necessary? Can I use the '79 tin? 

You cannot use the '79 tin.  The shape of the engine compartment of the 
Vanagon is different.  So is the engine compartment seal.  Since you 
will have to use the Vanagon tin, you will also have to use the Vanagon 
fan housing, alternator, and heater ductwork.  Since you will have to 
use the Vanagon heater ductwork you will not be able to use the '79 
exhaust in the Vanagon because it won't mate up with the Vanagon heater 
ductwork.  You will also have to find out what you want to do about a 
dipstick, because since you can't use the Bus tin, you can't use the Bus 
dipstick or oil fill tube :-) -- there may be other things, such as the 
different Vanagon engine mounts and bearer bar, which you will have to 
use! :-)

You could I guess just throw a complete '79 engine in the Vanagon, but  
the tin would certainly not seal the engine compartment and the engine 
wouldn't last too long at all.
