Subject: I've Got Bad Gas!

Mike ----  You're risking trouble if you just hit the starter key... I'd 
recommend against that!  The main problem with letting a tank sit is 
condensation in the tank, due to changes in temperature.  Obviously, the lower 
the fuel level, the worse the effect.  If the vehicle is kept at approx-
constant temperature, the condensation should be minimal.  The first thing you 
should do is get a length of clear plastic hose and siphon out a sample.  
Borrow your wife's turkey baster or some similar kind of small syringe so you 
don't suck it with your mouth ;-))

If the sample contains rust particles, you know what you gotta do... pull the 
tank and get it boiled out.  If the sample is just stinky but clear, siphon out 
all you can, install an inline fuel filter at the tank outlet, and then fill 
with fresh gas.

Next time you park for an extended period, make sure the tank is topped-off.  
You can reduce the risk of gas spoilage by adding a conditioner -- they sell 
this at hardware stores for lawn mower use in the Fall; also places like Farm &amp; 
Fleet and Tractor Supply have it in larger containers.  GOOD LUCK,  Glenn

Well OK, so it's really not me.  In fact, it's not even a bus.  It's my 76
914 that sat for a year and now the gas stinks.  

It only had about a quarter gallon of gas (or less) in it so can I just put
in a couple of gallons of fresh gas to dilute the stuff and run it till it
clears out?  What effect will this likely have on my fuel injectors and fuel
filter?  Bear in mind that this is a type IV FI motor so works pretty much
the same as a fuel injected bus.  Thanks! Mike g.
