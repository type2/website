Subject: using a used head

So im coming back to my 72 project bus right now. Ive kinda lost some 
interest in it since ive gotten my new bug (well now new.... but new to me) 
and now ive decided that i need to put the bus back together. Since im going 
to use a used head that I have from anther engine that was once in the bus 
(this was before i had the bus) I wanted to know what I should look for 
before I bolt the sucker on?? I already know, cracks between the valves, 
valve guide wear, what else though?? Any tips would be great. Also, is it 
enough to measure the bore with a straight edge and my eye, or should I get 
something to measure it with. Im not exactly sure of the bore on my engine, 
or on the used heads. Im assuming that they are both whatever is the 
standard for a 1700 engine (90.5?? what is it anyways, i dont have my books 
close by and I know ill forget later :-) but im just not sure if they are 
the same or not. Well thats it for now. Im sure ill have some more questions 
once i start putting things back together.

Joey
