Yes, this is correct..apples and oranges ... My oil temp sender is the type
that fits into the sump plate ... and requires a hole be drilled in the
plate. This is a late type IV engine with fuel injection, hydraulic
lifters, etc. Like those in the 78/79 loafs but with different heads.

&gt; I think you guys are talking apples and oranges here -- Dr. Williams
&gt;has a  later Type 4 engine, with the real long curved dipstick going in
the

fit
&gt;those engines AFAIK. You are trying to apply what he did to fix his oil
leak
&gt;to your Type 1 or very early type 4 straight, short dipstick, I believe.
