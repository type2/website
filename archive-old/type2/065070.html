I'm wondering about this bit, all battery explosions are likely
of a hydrogen-oxygen nature, what else is there?  From dads years
of maintaining banks of battery reserves for AT&amp;T BTW explosions
are nearly always the result of an internal defect (though possibly
from vibration etc) in which a lead connecting the plates or the plate
to a terminal breaks or becomes loose, causing an internal spark.  The
resulting explosion usually does not leave great amounts of charring/
burning as it was internal to the electrolye and mostly over
milliseconds after the explosion.  VW batteries as all know are
notoriously low quality.  The old black cased ones used till '88 or so
were actually quite OK, my '86 Quantum was fine on the origional in
'94.  Conversely the clear cased '86 van battery lasted 1 year, was
warranty
replaced, lasted 2 years, then got a generic.  The '89 Jetta, '90
Passat, '90 Corrado, and my '85 van batteries had all lasted under
2.5 years.  All were replaced with regular parts store batteries
(varying makes but only one or 2 battery manufactures anyway, Exide
and a few others) and lasted until we saw em go.  I know as a fact
though both the '86 Van and '90 Passat batteries were replaced under
the 2/24000 warranty.

&gt; Disconnected the battery remnants, jump-started the EV from my trusty
&gt; '87, and drove it to the dealer (for Eric Z.'s  benefit: Billco VW).
&gt; They were not helpful.

We bought the '90 Passat at Bilco and recieved OK service from them
for a couple of years, however when looking at Corrado's in '94 they
had pitiful sales and service had degraded.

VWOA attitude is not suprising either, like I always say the new
10/100000 is largely BS.  The dealer network is poor to offensive
the stuff covered is not the stuff that breaks, the only car that
such a warranty would have ever helped me on was the Quantum Syncro.
The fact that the A3 is a good car will not prove enough to save their
ass in America unless they really rethink their dealer network.
