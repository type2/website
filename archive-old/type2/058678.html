Subject: Bus for sale

Howdy Listers,
    Well, it finally happened.  I have to sell my pride and joy.  A 1973
Transporter, auto transmission, most of the air conditioner components,
very little rust.  I also have a 1.7 engine with dual solex carbs and a
1.8 with FI that go with it.  Also, the original 1.7 that was in the
Bus, but is now in pieces, will go if the new owner wants it.  The
original engine is in pieces because the PO cracked a head, tore the
motor apart, and was overwhelmed about having to put it back together.
I have the setup and the Weber carb if you want to dish the dual set-up
and I will throw that in also.  I just don't have the time or money and
want someone to get it back on the road.  I am asking $700 for the whole
set-up.
    We just had a new baby, and that seems to be taking ALL my time and
money right now.  P-mail me at bhayes_at_sunsix.infi_dot_net and I will give
you more details and the phone number where I can be reached.
    Thanks,
    Brian Hayes

    PS - I am in Paducah, KY.
