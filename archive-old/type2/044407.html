On all 3 of my 77 Westies, when you move the right heater lever all the way
down with the key on, the fan runs.
The lever has a gound connection that closes the relay mounted to the blower
bracket.
There is no connection whatsoever with the regulator.
I just looked at the wiring diagrams in Bentley for 73 thru 78. No
connection with the regulator there.

clue:)

&gt; I believe the aux fan is wired in with the voltage regulator so that it
&gt; will not run unless the alternator is charging.  Therefore it should never
&gt; run with the engine off even if the key is on.  Someone please correct me
&gt; if I'm wrong.
