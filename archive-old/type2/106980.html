Subject: 14/15 inch tires

I agree Dave, sometimes the arguments about tires, oil and gas get a little overboard.

Getting everybody running a little better is a more important list function than getting two people screaming &quot;heil hitler&quot; as they recheck their tire pressure semi-hourly. 

Me, I run 4 different passenger tires with my K-mart oil filter and a two-stroke mix in the tank.

I also enjoy smoking while changing my fuel filter.

Sock it to me!

Billy

&gt;It's awfully tiring fighting off the tire-spec n&amp;zis &gt;on this list.

&gt;How many people are running around out there with &gt;worn ball joints, leaky shocks and bad alignment?  &gt;Which do you think is more dangerous?  How come &gt;nobody ever talks about that stuff?
