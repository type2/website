Subject: [T2] Turnkey, Fuel Injected, New Mexican VW engines...

[...]

I tried to track down a source of turnkey [completely VW factory built] FI
engines last December, without success.

All the turnkey engines I found, available in the USA, were new VW Mexico
longblocks that were imported to the States and built up on this side of the
line by the distributor.  I was never able to get a straight answer as to
the source of the added parts, but I suspect many [if not all] were
aftermarket bits and pieces.  And they were all carbureted.

They build and/or install 1600 FI engines in new [as opposed to &quot;New&quot;]
Beetles at the VW Mexico plant.  These engines incorporate the very latest
case design and alloy, the latest FI design, and all the other type 1 engine
upgrades and refinements.  And they supposedly produce something like 67HP
:-)

A couple of years back a List member in the UK bought a new Brazilian Type 2
with this engine, and his reports of the bus's power and performance really
got my attention.

Somewhere/somehow there must be a way to [legally] obtain one of these
engines.  If anyone on the List knows of a source I hope they post the
necessary information.....

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I've seen turnkeys, but they are probably built up on this side of the
border from Mexican parts.  They have all been carbed, AFAIK.

It would be way kewl if you could get a FI turnkey, or even a complete FI
system for a type 1 engine.  I have a feeling that the price would be
quite dear, though.  &lt;&lt;
