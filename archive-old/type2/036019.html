Subject: Hydraulic Lifters???

I'm just in the middle of a complete rebuild on my '71 Westy.  Since my case 
is cracked and a new case is inevitable, I am thinking about hydraulic 
lifters.  Have any motor heads out there put hydraulic lifters in anything 
other than their type 4 case?  If so was it just a matter of changing the 
lifter bore, cam and the lifters or was there more to it?  Also where did you 
find the new lifters?  Thank you in advance.
