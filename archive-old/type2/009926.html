Subject: Baked enamel tinware?
Message-Id: &lt;199906211532.IAA08082_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

At the VW Classic last week I saw a bus with a type IV engine surrounded 
by tinware that had the appearance of baked enamel -- like a camper's 
water kettle. Gray fleck. It was pretty cool. Does it belong to anyone on 
the list? Is it likely to be real baked enamel, or are there rattle cans 
that will fake the appearance.

So, okay, I did come away from the Classic with something....
