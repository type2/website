Subject: LITLE BIT OF EXHAUST TROUBLE!!!!!

Merry Christmas everyone, i was going to work today and notice that Janis my
beloved 75 camper was making an unuasual amount of noise.  I got to work and
didn't think much about it at first since it seemded to subside as i went
further, but at the end of the day i was driving out and stopped in the
parking lot becasue she was really screaming by now i thought maybe i had
areal problem but when i looked down at the exhaust pipe and mufler it was
gone.  I slowly made my way home and checked it out further while trying not
to get rained on.. It appears to have just fallen off because all the
mountingm hardware is still there just no muffler or pipe.  I do have an old
bug exhaust and my question is will it affect performance or damage my bus
if i put this on since it seems like ti will mount on just fine. i am only
16 and have limited experience with such things and would like any advice..
thanks for your time.
