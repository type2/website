The venturi does generate vacuum, but it is not the same vacuum that is 
present at the vacuum advance port.  I used to think as you did (easy to 
come to the wrong conclusion by just looking at the carb) until Karl set me 
straight.

Don't believe me?  Try this test.  Hook up a vacuum gauge to the port in 
question and place it where you can see it while you drive.  A 20-ft vacuum 
hose around the outside of the bus in through the drivers window will work 
if you don't have an access hatch.  Now drive, and watch the gauge.  Note 
that at idle, there will be no vacuum advance.  At part throttle, there 
will be vacuum.  At full throttle, there will be NO vacuum.  No vacuum 
despite high air speed going through the carb!

The reason is because that port that goes into the center of the carb in 
the region of the venturi does not go straight into the venturi - it turns 
downward behind the venturi and exits just above the throttle plate.  When 
the throttle is opened *slightly*  manifold vacuum pulls past the throttle 
plate through the advance port but when the throttle is opened farther and 
manifold vacuum drops to zero, so does vacuum at the advance port.  That's 
right, the source of advance vacuum is manifold vacuum, NOT the venturi.
