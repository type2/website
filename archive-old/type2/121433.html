&gt; am told they are a simplier version of the ones used
&gt; on the 72 bus. They were supposily origional equipment
&gt; on type 3 in europe (I think). They are jetted for a
&gt; 1600 DP directly out of the box. Has anyone had
&gt; experience with these? The linkage is obviously
&gt; different from the stock 72 linkage as shown in the
&gt; picture. Any thoughts? Would the stock 68 fuel pump be
&gt; able to handle these carbs?
&gt; 

Hello David    These aren't quite like the bus carbs from 72-74  These are 
more like the old type 3 carbs from 64-67  They are pretty good carbs but have 
the same problems that all solexs ,kadrons,zeniths,webbers have  they don't 
have bearings on the crosshafts so evenually they will wear out there. when they 
are new they work great. As far as I knowq only Delloratos had bearings on the 
crosshafts .  For the money these should be good Later and have fun  mark
