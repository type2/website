Subject: leaky water tank
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Cut a patch from a coffe can lid (plastic) rough
up the area with sandpaper. Try a test spot with JBweld.
Make sure it sticks well to the tank first. Or any other
adhesive for that matter. Then put the patch over it. 
I would hold it on for a while with duct tape untill the
adhesive sets up.

   Just a thought. Dan
