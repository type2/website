Subject: Re: [T2] Re: bus instrumentation (alternate version)

Well first I don't know the supplier's info 1st hand and it might be proprietary info if I did but I know you can contact them directly and see if they can supply you with what you want or refer you to the right supplier... 

Good luck!

&lt;&lt; A friend owns a kit-car business and has a supplier who can built 
instruments with any face he wants. &gt;&gt;

Any...?
I can pass this info on to a couple other lists if it's to his benefit...
