Go buy a torque wrench.  You are asking for trouble.  ...or find a listee
who will loan you one.  If you are in San Diego, I will.

Volks,

I just picked up my new clutch/pressure plate and release bearing. I have 
them all installed already but have one question about the pressure plate. I

don't have a torque wrench and was wondering if I can manage tightening this

plate without one. I think the spec is 18ft lbs and I have all the bolts as 
tight as I can get them. I just put the engine back under the bus and 
hopefully I can get it back into the bus tonight if I'm lucky.

cheers....
