Subject: Re: [T2] Tips on tightening oil filler tube on type 1 engine

The specialty tool shown in the Bentley manual is available, cheaply, from
ACVW parts vendors.

Even using this tool, removal may be difficult due to buggered up notches
on the retaining nut, due to DPOs &quot;saving money&quot; by using the wrong tool.
For removal, I use an inside pipe wrench, available wherever fine plumbing
supplies are sold.  They come in several sizes, so measure the hole in
the retaining nut first.  Once out, the notches can be files square again,
and the nut re-installed with the specialty tool.  Remember to use a new
gasket and sealant (Permatex 3H) when re-installing.
