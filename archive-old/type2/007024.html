Here's an article I've found on the net that purports to objectively
test whether Slick50 and other oil additives are benificial or
detrimental to engines:

And an excerpt:

    The problem with putting PTFE in your oil, as explained to us by
    several industry experts, is that PTFE is a solid. The additive
    makers claim this solid &quot;coats&quot; the moving parts in an engine
    (though that is far from being scientifically proven). Slick 50 is
    currently both the most aggressive advertiser and the most popular
    seller, with claims of over 14 million treatments sold. However,
    such solids seem even more inclined to coat non-moving parts, like
    oil passages and filters. After all, if it can build up under the
    pressures and friction exerted on a cylinder wall, then it stands
    to reason it should build up even better in places with low
    pressures and virtually no friction.

    This conclusion seems to be borne out by tests on oil additives
    containing PTFE conducted by the NASA Lewis Research Center, which
    said in their report, &quot;In the types of bearing surface contact we
    have looked at, we have seen no benefit. In some cases we have
    seen detrimental effect. The solids in the oil tend to accumulate
    at inlets and act as a dam, which simply blocks the oil from
    entering. Instead of helping, it is actually depriving parts of
    lubricant.&quot;

Hope this helps.
