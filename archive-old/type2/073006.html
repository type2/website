Subject: Re: My dilema: Buy a '78 bus or a truck


&gt;My uncle says I should buy an older truck which would be easy to
&gt;work on and I could put a camper on it.

&gt;Has anybody had any experience with campers on the back
&gt;of trucks.

Sure. We had this immense cab-over &quot;slide in&quot; camper and a big Jeep pickup
truck. The camper was a $200 wonder, the aluminum siding was sort of coming
off and the bed over the cab sagged about 15 degrees. It was a pig but
there was a complete galley, lots of bunk space and (get this) a full
bathroom of approximately 1.5 square feet.

I doubt you could find a road in Colorado or Montana we didn't tour in that
thing, the less pavement the better, and had the finest time anybody could
have. I wish I could live it over again.

&gt;Is this as nice as a bus?

It depends on who is in the bus, Simon. 8) Don't do either out of fear of
mechanical mayhem, because that is going to happen either way. Get what you
want, then learn to work on it, then you don't have to worry. We'll help if
you like. But comparing two hypothetical old heaps is not going to work,
you have to know where you're bound before you can go about discovering the
way there. We don't know where you want to go, but I think you do in the
quiet of your own mind.
