&lt;&lt; For me, a home mechanic, I 
don't think there is a better value.  I've bought all of them on good sales, 
so I spent little if any more money than I would have for tools at Lowe's or 
maybe even Target.  &gt;&gt;

FWIW, the Kobalt line of tools at Lowe's is made by Snap-On...Craftsman
(not Sears) tools are made by Stanley...As of right now.  Of course with
the K-Mart link up, it's anybody's guess who'll be makin' em next week...
Home Depot's &quot;Husky&quot; line is also Stanley...Stay away from whatever is
also next to them on the display rack tho'...I'm always curious what part
of China/Taiwan the Ohio Forge is in... ?-(
