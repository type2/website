USA list members,
I am to undergo spinal surgery,  (low back),  on Dec 29, in Pittsburgh Pa.
I expect to be released from the hospital on Jan 2nd, and need to get
myself home to Lynchburg Va..  An 8 hour car ride is out of the question,
as is the hassle and seating on the commuter airliners that fly the
Pittsburgh to Lynchburg hop. So, I'm looking for a corporate type private
plane that  I could make a deal &amp; buy passage on. Does anyone know of a
bulletin board or list on the 'net where I might look to make contact with
pilots?
                                                                           
                Thank you &amp; happy holidays
