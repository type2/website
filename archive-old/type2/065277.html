&gt;The lower your vacuum the more gas you are using.  When you floor it under
&gt;load, the vac will drop immensely, and when you lift your foot off the gas
&gt;going down hill, it rises accordingly.  A permanent vac guage can be a
&gt;real driving habit improver.

At one time (you crotchety old farts will remember) the windshield wipers
on American cars were vacuum-driven. There was this enormous spade in a
half-circle housing that was sucked back and forth to power the wipers. You
had to take it apart and grease it up with Vaseline to get it to work at
all, and at that it didn't work very well. Pull out to pass a semi in the
driving rain and right when you punched it and hit the spray from his rear
wheels the wipers would quit. Nice.

I had this enormous 55 Oldsmobile (antique when I bought it, I'm not that
old) and I adored everything about it but the wipers...
