Subject: Re: [T2] Nice California Westy

My '74 Deluxe came from Longbeach cali. 
here is a few pics of what your talking about ,,, the folding tire and the air
pump

http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/spareVWtire.htm

 
&gt; 'Late' Westy as in 74/75 deluxe Westy only.
&gt; It went under the sink unit, which was behind the drivers seat. This was USA
&gt; models.

&gt; &gt; The vans which got these tires also got an air compressor that would pump
&gt; &gt; up the tire when you needed it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Never seen the VW version but I do recall a couple of domestic spare tires
&gt; &gt;like this.
