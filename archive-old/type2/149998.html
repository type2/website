Arnaud,

Yup, that9s what I said.

Cross drilling is optimal for track use or towing. If you don9t tow or race
your Bay, it would be overkill.

&gt; Jon,
&gt; I wish to say that IMHO drilling the rotors won't make my bus brake any
better
&gt; for the daily usage. I think it is irrelevant for bus driving as well as
any
&gt; kind of non-racing driving.
&gt;
&gt; The reason being that the brakes on my bus never get any close to fading.
In
&gt; daily driving the bakes are used only punctually, not right before the
turns
&gt; on a track.  Concerning downhill driving: I would rather rely on engine
&gt; braking (by selecting appropriate gear and initial speed) than groving the
&gt; rotors when it comes to driving a load safely down the mountain.
&gt;
&gt; Drilling the rotor helps the cooling of the brake
rotor//piston/caliper/fluid.
&gt; But is does not help the braking force available in normal driving
conditions.
&gt;
&gt; Drilling the rotors costs money and reduces the life span of the rotors.
