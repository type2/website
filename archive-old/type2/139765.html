Subject: Re: [T2] 1978, window crank failed

volks

   couple hours ago I wound down the drivers window and it wouldn't go
back up.  some investigation reveals it is obviously internal.

Bentley isn't very informative but it looks like a PITA to fix
 so
anyone who has done this, how difficult??
is the driver side and passenger side the same (I have a pass side door)
if not are they avaliable.  &quot;Bus Depot&quot; new or &quot;BustedBus&quot; used?

any help is appreciated, would you believe in 25+ years of owning buses
I've never had one of these fail.

thanks
Bob
