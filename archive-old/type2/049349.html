&gt; On a Safety-Kleen parts washer, there is a wire that holds the lid up. If

&gt; which is supposed to cut off the air to the fire and cause it to go out.

&gt; Next time the Safety-Kleen guy comes to our shop, I'll ask him if he knows
&gt; where to get some.

Perhaps a piece of solder?  You could even use a bit of plastic to get
the low melting temp.

However, the aircraft flame sensors are quite a bit more sophisticated,
since they actually sense the flame, not the heat.  By the time your
fusible link melts, the fire is well established!
