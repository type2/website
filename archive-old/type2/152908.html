Ah ha, I came into my 914 by pure chance; but I tell you, should you
come accross one, give her a shot.

The Type IV rumble &amp; fweem you know &amp; love is there, and much of your
bus drivetrain knowledge will transfer.  You get a fair-weather car
that can't be beat, plus they're a pleasure to work on, like busses.
You also get exquisite handling balance and a group of devoted 914
friends.  :)

George: Yah, we do get margianalized, but why worry about jerks?
Plus, (I hear) we can show up to PCA events &amp; beat the period 911s.
(Someday...  :)  ).

Honestly, one of my favorite things about the 914 is running the Type
IV in a light, balanced car.  It's a really killer engine.
