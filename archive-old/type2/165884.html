Subject: theorerectially looking for hypthesis(dropped exhaust valve?)

happy fourth, everyone.  started the day off with a leisurely cup of
coffee and then got to work on the bus.  some may recall from my
previous posts that i was guessing i had dropped an exhaust valve on
the #4 head.  to confirm this i did a compression test.  #4 read
105-110 psi each time.  so did #3.  #1 read 120 or so.  this looks
pretty good.  however, this does not help my hypothesis about a
dropped seat.  maybe its floating.  dunno.  after seeing these
readings, they are rebuilt heads on my 75 FI engine, i decided to look
at the rockers, pushrods and springs again.  everything looked fine
except the quarter inch play on the #4 exhaust.  yes, i'm fairly
certain the #4 was in firing position.  i have adjusted the valves
several times. not enough to be proficient but enough to know what i'm
doing.  so, before i proceed what else should i check?  what am i
missing?


i put the bus on a trailer and pulled her home last week.  had to
drive about one block from the trailer to my house.  she fired up just
fine but had no power under load and would pop, sorta like a small
backfire.  checked all the exhaust joints and saw know indicative
black from exhaust gasses.  pulled the tin under head and checked the
nuts holding on the header.  little loose, so i tightened them.  any
hypothesis would be welcome.  the more testable by me the better.


thanks,

happy independence day.

jeremiah
