Subject: Showstoppers toy cars for sale at cost

I think I paid $12 per set at Wal Mart a few years ago........these are
larger than matchbox cars, and are in a box 8&quot; X 8&quot; X 20&quot; or so....my
collection is getting too big, and i am cutting it down to small matchbox
sized cars.


One set is a gray splitty hauling a classic beetle on a trailer.....

The other set is a yellowsplitty hauling a new beetle on a trailer.......

First response gets them..........I would figure about $8 to ship.........i
would want to pack them good......

I can do paypal to the interested parties, and will reply to you by the end
of the day.
