Subject: RE: [T2] What do cylinder head temperature sensors cost?

&gt; The reason I ask is that, if they're not outrageous, all the FI bus owners
&gt; on the list may want to buy one for the glove box. Sounds like a necessary
&gt; spare to me...


They're not expensive, and I sell them.  But in an emergency you can simply
&quot;bypass&quot; the sensor by grounding the wire that goes to it.  This will make
the ECU think that the engine is completely cold (or fully warmed up; I
forget which but if memory serves me correctly it's the former; full ground
equals cold engine). This may not result in the optimal fuel mixture but
will generally work well enough to get you home.
