Mime-Version: 1.0

Sorry, never can remember which one of those words gets the &quot;N&quot;

Somebody out there with a 1968, 69, 70, 71 bus or Westy.....
Will you please go slide your ash tray out of the runners, and tell 
me.....
Just exactly how is the ash tray face plate affixed to the ash tray??

Is the ash tray face plate made of plastic or metal?

If a metal face plate, is it held on to the ash tray proper with a 
single nut that screws on to a bolt coming off of the back of the face 
plate?

If a plastic face plate, is it held on by two &quot;tabs&quot; that have been 
melted so as to flatten and serve as fasteners?

Yeah, I know, on the surface, this sounds pretty dumb, but it's important.
Not sure what that says about me.

Will post pictures to explain what I am into at a later date.
