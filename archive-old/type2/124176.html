Subject: Re: [T2] Mixture and 3-Gas analyzers

This is a very good article. I can see the technology is getting very 
complex. From your subject, it seems they are tracking more than one gas, 
but in the diagram, it looks like the CO, HC, H2, and NOx are just 
illustrated as being in the gas flow, with only the O2 being sensed. It 
would also appear that if you want to use a wide band sensor permanently in 
a bus gauge that it would be mandatory to supply the heater current.
