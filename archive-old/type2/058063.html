Subject: How can I get an old battery out?
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I've got a '71 Transporter Loaf (pix at =
http://www.newsguy_dot_com/~bnewman/vw).  The PO had almost run her into the =
ground; the existing battery is stone dead, zero charge.  There isn't =
even enough to light the dash lights.  The terminals and the cable =
connectors on them are mounded with corrosion.  I don't honestly know =
how it made it home even with the jumpstart. :)

Anyway, I've been having a heck of a time trying to get the connectors =
off of the old battery to put in a new one.  They don't wiggle at all.  =
Since the thing is dead anyway and I figure I can't hurt it, I've been =
spraying the connections with Liquid Wrench and letting that work in, =
then wire-brushing the connections.  It's been slow going; I've gotten a =
bunch of the corrosion off, but the connectors still aren't moving.

I know this isn't strictly a bus-oriented question (except for how to =
access the battery in the '71 model's &quot;battery nook&quot; on the right, while =
brushing corrosion off and squirting Liquid Wrench, and still try to =
breathe :), but does anyone have any advice for a newbie to auto =
maintenance?
