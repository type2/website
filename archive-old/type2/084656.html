&gt;Here is the situation.  Kadrons, synchronized car running 32 degrees total 
&gt;advance.  55 idle jets.  52.5's pop around 2k rpm, so I run the 
&gt;55's.  However this is running rich at idle, as evidenced by my sooty tail 
&gt;pipe and when i step on it from a stop, i can see the smoke.  1776 motor.
