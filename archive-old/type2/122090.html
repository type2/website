Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump

Jamie Rivers,
Could it be that as the fuel volume in the tank is reduced the cooling 
properties of the fuel is reduced (warm fuel is being circulated)?

&gt;
&gt;Mike,, if your trying to say your pump failed because you ran out of gas
&gt;,,, I disagree,, as soon as the AFM has no air flow,, the pump shuts
&gt;off,,, so, when the gas stops, the air flow stops, and the power to the
&gt;pump stops.... can't imagine the pump burning out in that time..
