&gt; I have a recurring issue as of late with one

&gt;  
&gt; All signs point to the seat going south, so
&gt; I need to pull the engine and have a look
&gt; see (correct?)
&gt;  
&gt; The engine is a GEX rebuild with 55k on it. I did
&gt; a lot of mountain travel this past summer, and
&gt; I guess I overpacked.

Count yourself _very_ lucky for getting this far on a GEX engine!  The
first and last GEX I bought went 40K in a carefully-driven bug!

I'd advise a complete inspection.  I wouldn't be surprised by anything I
found in there.
