Subject: Trailer Wiring

Greetings All,
I simply wanted to say thank you to those who took a moment out of their
busy lives to offer suggestions for my wiring dilemma.  I have learned a
lesson.  Ask the list before cutting wires!  Your suggestions of adding the
dual spade connector is really slick. Darn near professional looking.  18
fuses, 5 FLAPS later, I have everything working EXCEPT one situation (left
rear flasher with lights on)  Possible faulty ground as I think it over.
Any whooooo, thanx folks.

BTW, a Friday plug for Dixie Bus Gathering in Central Ohio August 8-10.

Respectfully,

Frank E Biffath III
