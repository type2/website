Mark, I don't know which bus you will install it in but I'll assume 78 since that's the best year. :-)

Look at current track 37/38 and you'll see how it's wired up. The wires run along the base of the dash (under the glove compartment) iirc.

The fans mount in the covers like this:

&gt;The switch that came with the fans is a 2 speed switch with what appears
&gt;to be 3 terminals.  Each fan has two terminals.  So now, how do I connect
&gt;them together and get them installed?

See the wiring diagram help abvove.

Ambulance fans is a misnomer: they are fresh air fans.
