&gt; I think the problem is definitely a vacuum leak, because I still don't
have
&gt; all the vacuum hoses hooked back up. I have the Haynes manual and the Muir
&gt; book, and I can't find a reference (hose diagram that's like looking at
the
&gt; engine) on where all those hoses go. I'm pretty sure I have the big hoses
&gt; hooked up right, but there's a couple skinny ones i'm not sure about. One
&gt; comes from the throttle body ( ! ) and splits.

This is ported vacuum. Ported vacuum is vacuum that appears only when you
open the throttle. Ported vacuum goes to the vacuum advance and the EEC
purge valve on the back of the air cleaner.

&gt; The other comes from the back
&gt; of the fuel return doohicky on the right side of the engine and splits.

This is manifold vacuum. Manifold vacuum is full vacuum at idle. It starts
at the nipple on the right side of the plenum between #1 + 2 intake runners.
It goes to the pressure regulator [fuel return doohicky] and the decel valve
[the round unit on the gas tank panel to the right of the charcoal
cannister].

&gt; The
&gt; one from the throttle body is currently connected to nipple on the back of
&gt; the air intake and the second split is hanging free.

Goes to vacuum advance on distributor.

&gt; The one connected to
&gt; the fuel return is currently connected to the side of the intake manifold
&gt; and the diaphragm mounted on the front of the engine compartment.

This is correct

&gt; It's
&gt; probably all wrong, please help!
&gt;
&gt; Also, where does the distributor vacuum advance hose connect?? right now
&gt; it's connected to the tube that runs across the top rear of the engine
&gt; compartment. That's probably wrong too.

See above for vacuum advance.

The tee that connects the two tubes by the blower motor connects to the
right end of the charcoal cannister. This is fuel vapor that the charcoal
cannister absorbs. The large hoses on each end go: left one to the tube on
the big fan housing [if you don't have add-on airconditioning], the right
one goes to the EEC purge valve on the back of the aircleaner. EEC means
'evaporative emissions control'. Remember what I said about ported vacuum?
When you shut the engine off, the charcoal absorbs the fuel vapor. When you
drive down the road, ported vacuum opens the diaphragm on the back of the
aircleaner. This opens a passage between the air entering the AFM [this is
the air your engine runs on] and the large tube on the right end of the
cannister. The air moving thru the AFM is low pressure [suction, but not
vacuum!]. This draws the fumes out of the charcoal. In other words, it
purges the fumes from the charcoal.

&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance for any insight, and thanks to all the volks who
replied.
&gt;
&gt; Peace!
