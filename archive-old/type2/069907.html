I just bought some heads from AVP and am very satisfied with them.  I
would recommend them, they're friendly and know what they're talking
about.

Check out the heads and valves on your bus.  I had a bad valve and lost
tons of power because of it.  When I pulled the motor and had the heads
off, the bottom end was in great shape.  BTW, I have a '74 with an 1800
type IV like yours, but with 163,000 miles.

Maybe this will solve your problem.
