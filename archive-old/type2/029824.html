The Rockford boots seem to be a bit shorter than the stock boots.  You
need to move the &quot;Axle&quot; end of the boot toward the CV (it won't be between
the &quot;bumps&quot; any more).  Use narrow worm drive hose clamps to secure the
ends of the boot to the flange and axle.  Don't tighten them too much!

George &lt;3+ years on Rockfords.  Still no cracks!

&gt; Last fall, I installed new CV joints with new Rockford boots on my 79 at

&gt; drove it a bit I crawled underneath and saw that CV joint grease had
&gt; somehow worked its way out of the joints and sprayed all over the place due
&gt; to the the effects of centifugal force.  This happened with both the inner
&gt; and outer CV joints.  A hell of a mess under there.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone else seen this happen?  Is this normal?  Someone suggested that
&gt; I had overpacked the joints.
