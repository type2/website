&gt; 
&gt; Well, I have a little more to add.
&gt; 
&gt; Wires in a vibrating object like a car are generally of the stranded type,
&gt; presumably because solid wires are prone to breaking. However when you start
&gt; soldering them you actually turn them into a solid wire. The soldered end
&gt; will become brittle and is a probable source of breakage. Actually the
&gt; crimp-on connectors are not so bad. The trick is that you have to apply
&gt; proper pressure when crimping them on. In the factory they will use heavy
&gt; duty tools and connectors that correctly match the wire diameter. 

You're not a'kidding there!  The factory crimps are done under huge
pressure.  If you carefully remove a factory-crimped connector you will
find the copper wire underneath to be bright and shiny, just as it was
when new.  I don't believe that you can get this level of protection with
consumer-grade crimping tools, so soldering is the best way to avoid
corrosion and loosening problems.  I've seen quite a few failures of
home-crimped
connections due to corrosion and loosening, and I'm a desert dweller.

I've never had a soldered connector fail, but no connector should be under
constant stress.  IN high-vibration/motion situations, the wire should be
supported on both sides of the connector, whether the connector is crimped
or soldered.

Also the
&gt; isolation on the crimp-on connector supports the wire so it will not break
&gt; so easily. Back in tech college I was taught the following procedure for
&gt; stranded wires that have to be screwed down in plugs, terminal blocks,  etc.
&gt; 
&gt; - Remove about an inch (2.5 cm) of isolation.
&gt; - Hold the soldering iron at the end of the stranded wire and let the solder
&gt; flow so the strands are soldered together.
&gt; - then cut off most of the soldered end leaving only about 1/8 of inch (2-3
&gt; mm) soldered.
&gt; - screw it down on the unsoldered part.
&gt; 
&gt; Two reasons for this. As I said, the soldered end is brittle and likely to
&gt; break just at the point where it leaves the terminal block or whatever. And
&gt; over time the solder will 'flow' under the pressure of the screw causing the
&gt; connection to loosen.
&gt; 
&gt; So I have no hesition in using crimp-on connectors. But make sure you use
&gt; the right diamter for the wire and crimp them on with all the power you have
&gt; in you. Use proper tools, makes life easier (ever tried to use one of those
&gt; plastic tools to mount an RJ-11 telephone plug and you know what I mean).
&gt; 
&gt; One more note: unsoldered connections can actually be better than soldered
&gt; ones. I found that hard to believe when in the seventies wire-wrapping came
&gt; into use in the computer industry. But the electrical connections made with
&gt; wire-wraps had a lower resistance then soldered connections. But here again
&gt; the procedure must be carried out with the proper skills and tools.

Wire-wraps were made by tightly coiling a light wire to a square pin.  The
corners of the pin made good low-resistance connections with the wire,
since there were dozens of contact points under high local pressure.
However, note that wire-wrap connections were usually not subjected to
harsh conditions.  If they were, they would loosen and corrode easily.

It is important that there be a good mechanical connection before you
apply solder.  Solder is not a good conductor, but it is a good &quot;holder&quot;
and sealer.
&gt; 
&gt; Well I guess you never knew there was so much to say about a liitle things
&gt; as joining two wires.

Next week, how to attach PL-259 connectors... :)
