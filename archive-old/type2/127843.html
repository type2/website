&gt; sure sounds like it, bummer, wonder he doesn't just buy a bus ticket, take

He has had this bus for several years (I think since 97) and has
driven across the country in it. I think it has some emotional value
to him.
 
&gt; &gt; His old engine has about .075&quot; endplay, and the new one is only
&gt; &gt; slightly better at .065&quot;. The new engine actually only had a small
&gt; &gt; amount of play if you don't account for the main bearing moving in the
&gt; 
&gt; is there any way to &quot;pin&quot; that main bearing so it doesn't move (JBWeld??)
&gt; I'm not that familiar with the type 1 engine has been many many years
&gt; since I worked on one.

The only trick I have ever heard of working is using a harley piston
ring behind the thrust surface, we considered it, but who knows. I
didn't think about something like jb weld or anything. After all it's
not gonna move much more, right? :)
