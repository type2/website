Electric blankets can be purchased from most truck stops and truck dealers
parts stores.  They come in various sizes and if turned on while driving
will prewarm the bed and save storage battery electricity.

&gt; I know several people were looking for 12V blankets or 12V bed heaters.
&gt; I don't know anything about them just ran across the
&gt; web site while surfing 12V accessories.
