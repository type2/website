Subject: Oil Sensor Wiring Help

My oil light would not turn on today during my start up routine.  When I
got to the back to check the oil sensor, I found that the wire and
broken.  Looking around the engine compartment for the other &quot;half&quot;, I
found only one &quot;wire&quot; to reconnect to.  

However, this is where I am confused.  It looks like it doesn't really
connect to a wire, but a small rectangular piece of plastic with wire
running thru it.  The plastic piece is about 1 1/2 inches long with a VW
logo at one end, the word weco at the other end and the numbers 440 in
the middle.  

Is this plastic piece important or can I just cut it out of the loop and
reconnect the wires on either side?  The wire snapped right at the edge,
so if it is a resistor or something, I will have to get new one.

This is a 1976 FI Engine that was rebuilt professionally by a reputable
local garage.  I haven't had to do to much besides the regular
maintenance on it, so any help is appreciated.

Thanks,

--kevin--
