&gt; 1700 heads with EGR ports can be filled with M10X1.0 Bolts.
&gt; I'm curious why nobody seems to mind the fact he has a
&gt; flycut 1700 head on one side and an 1800 head on the other.
&gt; These heads  have different valve sizes and different combustion
&gt; chamber design, with different volumes, and so different CR on
&gt; both sides of the engine. Not a good idea. Back to the Bentley.

&gt; &gt;Actually Jake, it sounds like he's got the stock early 1700 heads. They
had
&gt; &gt;holes that were just behind the exhaust valve outlet for the air
injection
&gt; &gt;tubes that connected to the air pump, as part of the exhaust gas
afterburning
&gt; &gt;(i.e.,. Emission Control) system. Early mod.s had holes at all four
exhaust
&gt; &gt;ports, later mod.s had them at 1,2 and 3 only. They can easily be tapped
and
&gt; &gt;plugged.
