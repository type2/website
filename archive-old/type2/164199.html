Subject: warning  light  buzzer?

Hi List,
 
My wife was out and about in our 71 bus today doing errands.  As she pulled
into a parking lot she noticed the generator light was on so she immediately
parked the bus and shut it down.  She went around back to find that the
generator belt had been thrown off.  She has no idea how long the belt was
off but did have the presence of mind to note that the engine didn't smell
or feel unusually hot.
 
This brings me to wonder if anyone, with the type 1 engine,  has hooked a
buzzer up to their generator light so you would be warned if something like
this happened to you.
