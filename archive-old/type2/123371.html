Subject: Lowering a Bus....a little

Hi Folks,

I can't believe I'm actually writting this, but does anyone know how to
lower a bus without great expense...safetly?
I've read the articles on Bus Bus adjustable front end and their rear
boomerangs, but for $1000 I would think there would be some really high-tech
ways to lower a bus?  Hydraulics or air suspension etc...
I'm not looking for the bus to graze the asphault, just thinking of lowering
a bit below the high-sprung look of a stock Bay-Window... Any suggestions
greatly appreciated as always :-)

-Tom
