 &gt;&gt;Funky ('71camper 1600dp) has a .009 in him now.  Beetle Bug (our '71 Super

She's going to be parked for the winter and (hopefully) he'll be on the road. 
Do you think I'd be better off with the vac. adv. in Funky?  How would I go
about doing this?&lt;&lt;  

First of all, check http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com  distributor specification
page to be sure that the dizzy out of your bug will work on the bus. If so,
why not just pull it out and put the 009 into the bug. Bugs seem to be more
receptive of the 009 than buses are, so you may even notice that the 009 works
very well in your bug and make it a permanent swap. Just be sure that you get
the timing set correctly for each dizzy, the 009 can be set statically at 7-10
BTDC, while the vac dizzy will have to be set with a strobe light, see the
oldvolks page to see where it should be timed.
As for removing the dizzy, just turn the engine by hand til the rotor lines up
on the notch in the dizzy case, indicating that #1 is at TDC. Then remove the
dizzy and put in the new one making sure it seats completely, then turn the
dizzy body around (rotor shaft stays stationary if seated correctly) until the
rotor lines up with the notch on the new dizzy.  When I changed my 71 bus
dizzy from 009 back to stock, i noticed that the TDC notch is in a completely
different position on the 009 than on the stock dizzy.  Don't let this confuse
you, as it did me! Just turn the dizzy body until the rotor lines up with the
notch in the dizzy case, if your dizzy is seated completely and correctly,
then this will be lined up at TDC. And make sure that you replace the spark
plug wires in the correct place on the new dizzy, remember that #1 will likely
be in a different position on the vac dizzy. the #1 wire should go on the cap
directly above where the rotor now sits, then going clockwise around the dizzy
cap it will go #4, #3, #2. 
My 71 saw a noticeable improvement with the stock vac dizzy, once I got the
timing correct, so I expect you'll see the same!
