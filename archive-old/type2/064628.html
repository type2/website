Subject: Re: Question about water tank lock

&gt;The lock was missing on the fresh water tank of our Westy when we
&gt;bought it, but the PO found the lock and brought it to us yesterday.
&gt;He never had a key from the owner before him so I am wondering how
&gt;I should go about getting a key.  
&gt;
&gt;Do the VW dealerships have keys?  Is it expensive to have a 
&gt;locksmith make a key from the lock?  Can I get one of you to make
&gt;a copy of yours and will it fit? 

Juli,
Had the same problem when I bought my '85 Westy (except that the lock was 
already locked onto the resevoir, with no key!).  The lock has no key code 
on it, so VW cannot make you a duplicate.  Nor can they sell you a new lock 
and key.  You have to buy the complete water filler assembly (about $40, I 
think, from Delta Six) to get a new lock and key.  I went to a locksmith, 
who removed the lock for me but could not custom make a key because he 
didn't have a small enough blank.  However, someone I know did bring his 
key into another lock shop and they made him a copy, so I'm sure such a 
blank is available.  If I were you I'd try a locksmith or two before 
considering paying for a whole new assembly.

Unless anyone else knows of an option that I'm not aware of?

p.s. Since you posted this to the Type 2 list, I assume you are not on the 
Vanagon list. I will cross-post this to the Vanagon list for you, since 
there are more subscribers there who have Vanagon Westies and may have a 
better solution.
