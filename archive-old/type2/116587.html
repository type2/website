Subject: tranny change miscellany

volks,

Super nice weekend.  Took the opportunity to rebuild a set of DRLAs and
clean off the workbench. . . The 1835 is getting new rebuilt 041 heads and
lower compression (6.8 too low?) which I decided to do after she terminally
spit out a spark plug.  Also getting ready to install an 091 in the '70 and
have a few questions to humbly throw out for the list:

1.  Who has the best CV boots right now? I have heard Rockford is the best
but don't know who sells these.  Also want to get all new bolts.  Good
source?  Didn't see these on the bus depot page.

2.  Has anyone made any better repro main shift rod bushings? or,
alternately, has anyone figured out how to make the poorly-cast badminton
things work?  I was thinking on epoxying them to the rod.

TIA,
Will Anderson
