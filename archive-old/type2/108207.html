Subject: Re: [T2] Report...trip to germany

From: Dave C. Bolen

&gt; I did see a bus picture #1 here...  http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/germantrip/

Interesting pics....
The bus in 2 and 3 is a combo of parts, appears to be a 73-75 but has a 76-79 engine lid lock and 78-79
Champagne bumper rubbers. I thought the small Euro pop top was 68-72?

I am unsure of the pretty bug in 4 and 5.... appears to be a 69-70 by the engine lid but has 68 bumpers. The
chrome front and rear turn signals are different.
That greenish car in the top left of 5 and in 6 reminds me of a NSU Prinz. Any idea what it was?
It resembles a Lada [Russian Fiat 124 sedan] but they don't have the indented body along the top of the
fenders and doors.

I would love to know the &quot;M code&quot; for #7.....
