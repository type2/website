...well, i gave that advice, because the relay trick doesn't always
work, and the
single wire, believe it or not is MUCH easier than
dealing with all the wiring in a relay . if the original wiring if
fried, it
cannot trip the relay, cause nothing is coming to it at all.
maybe something that can be done is to
hook up the relay, and then check with a
voltmeter for 12 Volts. if you don't get 12 volts, then it is
unquestionably the
wiring,
and you will have to use the push button,
or rewire your ignition altogether.
good luck, walt-
