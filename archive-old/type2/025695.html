I'd rather drive a lot of cars than that one, but I'm betting you wouldn't
freeze yer butt off in this.

Where I think they screwed up (no, not in putting the engine at the wrong
end, which they did; this is a modified Eurovan for many reasons not the
least of which is that they already spent the cash for the government to
test the Eurovan):

* Not enough windows. Who here hasn't dreamt of finding a 21-window in primo
condition that they could afford? Windows around the top, please.

* The back end. By putting an &quot;engine compartment&quot; with a locking door back
there where the engine is supposed to go, you've got the makings of a real
nice trunk. Is there one? No, of course not.
