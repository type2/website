&gt;In doing some price checking at some local franchise part stores, I keep
&gt;getting asked whether I have a bus made before Feb, 74 or after March 74.
&gt; The Volks catalogs and websites that I'm checking don't mention anything
&gt;about a difference between buses made before or after Feb/March.  Has
&gt;anyone experienced this before, or are the franchise stores just
&gt;confused.

74 was a changeover year - I believe the early ones (72 on with 1700 engine
in U.S.) came with the 210mm clutch setup while the later ones (1800 engine
through 1975 in U.S.) came with 215mm clutches.  In 76 they went to 228mm
clutches (with the 2-liter engine in the U.S.).  

To be sure you should probably measure your old clutch against the ones in
the store.  I wouldn't trust the build date on the bus unless you are the
original owner - who knows what a P.O. might have had installed.

The 210 and 215mm clutches are very similar.  My bus is a '73 and I had the
210mm one originally, but last time I had the engine out I upgraded to the
215 for a bit more grip - it was a noticeable improvement and did not
require changing bellhousings, starters, or any of that fun stuff.
However, it may have required a different flywheel - I can't for the life
of me remember for sure if I had to change it or not.  

What I am getting at is that you might just want to get the larger clutch
(ask for one for a 75 bus so there is no ambiguity).  Make sure that the
clutch disc fits inside your flywheel and that the pressure plate will bolt
to the flywheel and you will be in business - everything else will be
identical.  

If it doesn't fit your flywheel take it back and get the 210mm setup (ask
for 73 bus to avoid ambiguity again!).  Or, you might want to try and find
a 74-75 flywheel for a nice clutch upgrade.

&gt;Also, I am having trouble figuring out what month my bus was made.  Does
&gt;anyone know where I can find this information, and if it's on the VIN#,
&gt;what do I need to look for?

The month and year of manufactureshould be listed on the tag on the
drivers-side door jam near the latch.
