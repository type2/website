Subject: 72 Air Cleaners

Good Day All-
After a very long absence, I'm finally back on the list.

Fathers Day was a great day for this Dad.
My buddy came over and we completely put my motor back together,
installed it, started it up and it runs!
(I bought this 72 Westy with the motor out and a stripped spark plug
hole.  Couldn't heli-coil, but I have something like ten 1.7 heads in
the garage!  Found a good one, did a valve job and re-installed)

which brings me to the items I am missing still.

I need an aircleaner for a 72.
It should be an oilbath, I have both airhorns, one with the rubber,
one without.
Still need a spare wheel, &amp; dipstick but I can make due without for
now.

Now I have to figure out all the wiring.  The P.O. had a some sort of
serial loom for the motor.  Picture a wire starting at the coil, going
to the jet on the left carb, then up to the choke, then over to the
right carb choke, down to the jet, and then on to somewhere else that
I haven't figured out yet.  I know he was trying to get power to all
these items, but that can't be right.  Anyone know how it's supposed
to go?
I have the Haynes, the Clymer, and the big green Bentley but can't
figure out the correct way.
Now if this was a 914 with F.I.... but that's a different story.

Thanks!
