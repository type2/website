Subject: Re: smells like gas.

&gt; Howdy everyone, I have a 77 westi, all stock.  Here is my problem:  I can
&gt; smell gas fumes when I have the heater on.  When the heater is off there
&gt; are no gas fumes, at all.  I have looked all over and can't find any sign
&gt; of leaking.  I have read all the back posts about cracks in the hoses and
&gt; fuel sloshing and that but I can only smell it when the heater is on.  I
&gt; live in Bellingham Washington and if I can't get this worked out I am
&gt; going to go brain dead by spring.

Marcus,
Had this one a couple weeks back on my '79.  Only smelled gas with a full
tank when the heater was on.

Check all your fuel hoses in the engine compartment.  In my case, when I had
the heater on the blower in the engine room was picking up the fumes and
sending them through the heater.

Mine was leaking for a hard-to-see source:

If you have a deluxe Westy, remove the aux. battery and if you have just a
regular Westy stick your head in the left side of the engine room.  Look
sorta up and forward and you should see some metal vent line running around
up there.  The vent line goes from the top of the gas tank, back at the
sides of the Bus and then way up into the air scoops and back down.  On the
left side only, 2 pieces of this metal line are joined by a rubber hose.
It's often overlooked when replacing fuel line, and mine was dripping gas on
a full tank.  Not cool!

So check that out...
