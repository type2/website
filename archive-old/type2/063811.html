Subject: Vanagon radio

I put a new radio and speakers in this weekend. I used the red radio wire
which is hot all the time for the clock and memory backup. Since I really
didn't want to worry about leaving the radio on by accident when not in the
car, I ran the power through the ignition switch rather than using the same
unswitched power. I could not find a reference to nor could I locate an
&quot;accessory&quot; position in the key switch that would allow me to have the radio
on with nothing else. As it is, I can turn the radio on when the various
warning lights etc come on just prior to cranking.  Is there an accessory
position that I missed?
If not, is there any harm in having the vehicle &quot;on&quot; for any length of time
just to listen to the radio? Is anything actually on other than the warning
lights?

Thanks,

Weston
