Subject: Episode: Pandora goes dead.

My 7-year-old daughter wants to go practice soccer this afternoon, so we
hop into the white bus and off to the Municipal Soccer Fields, which is
really an old landfill and is highly unstable and badly graded from the
beginning but it's fairly close and does alright for practicing corner
kicks and whatnot.

So two blocks from our house the bus bucks once, then quits. Pull over, try
to start it again, from the way it acts (I can get a vroom but it won't
keep running) it seems like lack of gas. Walk two blocks home holding
hands, get the red bus which has tools to beat the band, off we go to fix
the white bus.

Pull the line off the carb, my daughter confirms that gas does NOT come out
when I spin the engine. She's good help, very literal, doesn't try to get
ahead of me. 8) Pull the line from the tank to to the fuel pump, gas GUSHES
out, I shall stink for the next 36 hours. Golf tees, have to dig but they
are in the tool box.

How much is this worth: I have the fuel pump in the red bus, bought a spare
just in case when we went to Kansas to get the white bus. It is the same
CoFab crap that failed here after 2K miles and I desperately need to get a
German spare for both buses but I don't have to tell my daughter that.

It's not that I want to be her hero, so much as this: I want her to see
that when something goes wrong, you figure out the problem and then you fix
it. If you have the part then you bolt it in, if not then there's no
disgrace in hiking for it. But know before you leave what can go wrong.

Bolted the new one in (that back side nut is a bitch if you don't want to
take the distributor out), rode home in the red bus then hiked back to the
white bus.

Practiced corner kicks.

I'm pretty sure she learned a lot. You can't be that sure with kids but I
think I was in there. 8)
