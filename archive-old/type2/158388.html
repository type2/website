Subject: RE: [T2] truck pics

That is just beautiful!  I so want one!


&gt;&gt;here's a link to the photos of the recently completed single cab.
&gt;The engine was rebuilt just prior to my purchasing the truck back in
&gt;'03  so I didn't do anything to it besides convert it to FI (from
&gt;dual pdsit's)  enjoy!  Greg
