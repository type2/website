Subject: &quot;North to Alaska, goin' north, the bus is gone...&quot; (Was doormobile goes north)

Garp and List, et. all,

While I've never been to the Arctic Circle, other than the one down
the block for a cherry dip-cone (Note: in the U.S. there's a fast-food
chain called &quot;Arctic Circle&quot;); having bussed through some seriously
cold-ass winters in Idaho, I've got some advice for you. 

1-NEVER set your emergency brake!!!
2-Thoroughly lube all external cables (brake, speedo, clutch,
throttle, etc.) using LIGHT viscosity oil.
3-Buy a battery that fills the entire back of the bus, or one that is
rated for the space shuttle: whichever one offers roadside assist in
the arctic tundra (or Pluto, in the case of the space shuttle model).
4-Get some SERIOUS antifreeze windshield cleaner fluid for your
reservoir (or empty the damn thing, as it's useless anyway).
5-Carry spares of EVERYTHING.
6-LUBE your door locks, or better still, don't use them.

My reasoning here:

Even in the bitter cold, snow melts when it comes into contact with
heat and produces water (while we can all argue that busses offer no
heat, it DOES happen). When you park the bus for even a short time,
that water freezes and turns to ice. 

&quot;Well of course&quot;, you say; &quot;any fool knows that.&quot; 

Yes, but...why does the ice ALWAYS build up on cable
connections/junctures????! How many of you have had your e-brake
freeze in the &quot;on&quot; position????? Not fun.

I've also had speedo cables freeze solid and snap when I tried to
drive my bus. After only 30 minutes of sitting. Also not fun.

I've been lucky in that I've never had a throttle cable freeze... 

I can just see it...10 degrees F. outside, everythings frozen (myself
and the motor oil included), pump the gas pedal before turning the
key, cable sticks (but I don't know it), turn the key, motor starts
with carb stuck wide open, slight delay in turning off the key (hey,
I'M FROZEN TOO!!!) results in fried bearings('cause the oil's still in
the freezer otherwise known as the crank-case), motor throws a rod and
cracks the case ('cause it's brittle from being frozen), tow truck is
called to get the bus home to the heated (30 degrees F.) garage at
your house, tow driver tries to pull the bus, but the e-brake cable's
frozen, so you gotta crawl under the bus with a hammer to break off
all the ice build-up and get frost-bite in the process, then the
tow-driver pulls your bus away, but since you forgot to de-ice the
speedo cable, it snaps as your baby is dragged away lifelessly, you,
of course, mourn this fact as the doctors in the emergency room remove
your  frost-bitten fingers from your otherwise healthy body, upon your
release from the hospital, you arrive home to realize that you left
your house key in the bus and since you also forgot to lube the locks,
you break off the key in the lock and have to break the window to get
in, which is real easy since the glass is brittle from the cold
anyway....

Okay, so I went a *little* over the top...

BUT, all jokes aside, these things can and do happen (maybe not the
finger-amputation, but the other stuff).

Something to think about: the very same people who designed our
beloved busses also designed vehicles for the German war effort in
WWII. These vehicles had to perform on the eastern front (read
SERIOUSLY COLD here) as well as in northern Africa. It was common
practice during WWII to light bonfires underneath tanks (on the
eastern front, silly. It would be counter-productive in Africa!!!) in
the morning before even TRYING to start them (the Russians did the
same on their tanks) to loosen the ice that would sometimes literally
freeze them in their tracks, as well as to warm the motors and/or oil
to a point that they would even turn over.

My point here (collective sigh from the list), is, that at severe
temperatures (high or low), steel has TOTALLY
different characteristics. So does oil. 

Don't get me wrong, I think the bus/bug is the best snow car on the
road. But they are fragile in the first place; placing them in a
hostile (temperature wise) environment, only increases your risk for
disaster.


As an aside, is anyone else on the list interested in the
Volkswagen/WWII connection? I'd like to hear from you; p-mail, of
course.

Before anyone gets out the flame-thrower to flame me; I'm fascinated
with the WWII stuff in a historical way only. If you wanna flame me
for wasting your time with this extended e-mail, go for it ('course, I
got the next two days off with nothing better to do and I just might
write you back with even MORE innanities!!!!).
