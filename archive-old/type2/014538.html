&lt;&lt; So does that mean the 34 Pict 5 is a better performing (new, out of the

 carb than a similarly new 34 Pict 3?  Or are they different carbs altogether
 and not interchangeable? &gt;&gt;

 I cant answer all you questions, but I do know for a fact...that an old vw 
rabbit I had that was carbed, had a 34 Pict 5 on it. And it was an original 
factory carb as far as I am aware.
