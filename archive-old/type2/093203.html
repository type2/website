Subject: Re: [T2] loosing brake pressure!!HELP!!!


&gt;  the pedal went slowly to the floor
&gt; &gt; inch by inch. the fluid
&gt; &gt; level  hasn't changed
&gt; &gt;  74 with a 2.0l and a single Webber
&gt;
&gt;Sounds like the brake booster is going bad or you have
&gt;lost your vaccume to it. Phil

Sounds like every failed master cylinder I have ever had - the seals have 
gone bad. You can buy a rebuilt master cylinder or you can buy all new 
rubber parts for the inside and rebuild it yourself for cheap!

Disconnect the booster from the engine and plug the engine vacuum source so 
the engine will run properly. Now see if the pedal still fails towards the 
floor when you hold your foot on the pedal. If it does then the master 
cylinder can't make pressure and hold it because the fluid is leaking past 
the pistons and seals inside.

You can pump the pedal to get home but I recommend you fix it before you 
drive anymore as the master cylinder repair is much cheaper than a repair 
after a serious accident....

Procedure: put a pan under the master cylinder to catch the leaking fluid, 
buy a proper wrench for the line fittings, loosen and remove the lines from 
the master cylinder, remove the two nuts that hold the master cylinder to 
the booster. Remove master cylinder. Reinstall in reverse. Bleed the whole 
system with new brake fluid. Dot-3 or 4 I THINK (verify this).

Notes: brake fluid will remove the paint on anything it touches.
