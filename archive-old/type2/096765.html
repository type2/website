LN Engineering.&lt;http://www.lnengineering_dot_com/biralbabies.html&gt; &quot;Biral Babies&quot; 
cylinders (same as 911 cylinders). Iron core, aluminum fins, spaced _at_ 6 per 
inch. About a G for the cyls alone, Upwards of 2G for a complete piston and 
cyl kit. Rabie uses them in most of his high end builds. On another note, I 
wonder just how long that type1 turbo set-up is gonna last as there appears 
to be no engine seal in place (and no way to make a seal work with the 
plumbing set up the way it is), tin is missing (to accommodate said 
plumbing), and the down pipe sits right in front of the  fan. VW Trends. The 
same people who run mucho expensive adds for GEX, and tell you thermostats 
aren't needed. Gee, I wonder why I don't subscribe to such a tech inspired 
rag...
