Subject: Re: [T2] Pertronix ignitor woes

I got mine from aircooled_dot_net and it fit in perfectly.  I did have to 
grind down the rotor (like the note on aircooled's site) to accomodate 
the magnet disk but that was trivial.

What model bus were you trying to install it on?  Mine's a 78..

&gt; I'm here to complain about compufire.
&gt; I bought one that didn't fit but the selling store said it fit.
