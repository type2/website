I wish! I live in the middle of nowhere and there is
*no* salvage-yard of any sort here (can you believe
it???). The nearest salvage is 15 miles away, but they
have *zero* VW parts....

I may just suck it up and drive as-is and replace it
all next month....I really don't want to, but.....

&gt; if this month is team no bucks then I think I would
&gt; go to a pic n pull yard 
&gt; or see if I could find some used, think they run
&gt; about $2 a the yards around 
&gt; here.
&gt; at least that way your not doing any further damage
&gt; to the drum or your 
&gt; pocketbook, just some of your time.
