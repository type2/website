Subject: Frail wiring

Today I had occasion to strip the insulation from some wiring from a
donor Vanagon wire loom.
In the process I found a hard / burned spot in the middle of a wire about
four foot long. I started stripping the insulation from about two feet of
wire and when I found the burned spot I went ahead and stripped about six
more feet without finding any other hot spots.
I have noted that Audi, Porsche and VW use a fine multi stranded wire in
many applications, particularly for reading the output from senders for
oil pressure, cylinder head sensor for the FI, oil temp senders and volt
meters.
I can see that a burned spot in the copper conductor could cause bad
reading of sensors.
A recent post addressed the resistance caused by *cold and fatigued*
solder joints.
I am most familiar with the hanging on by two threads scenario on older
vehicles like my Vanagon and the push on connectors / lugs getting loose
(starters mostly).
Since the insulation did not show discoloration or surface cut I am
baffled by the burned section in this wire.
