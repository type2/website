I figured that it was FI. I have a 79. Same car.
After rebuilding my motor and a $450 tune up at
the local
VW dealer, they informed me that it was necessary
to
purchase a new Mass Air Flow Meter.
http://type2_dot_com/bartnik/afm.htm

Well these are about $450 new and since my last
$450 went to
them, I wasn't about to spend another $1.

For Free, do a (mass air flow) search on Type2_dot_com
and
you'll find a story about carefully removing the
printed
circuit board in this sensor and re-aligning the
board so
that the &quot;wiper&quot; contact area has a fresh path
above the
old warn one. I successfully did this after having
the
same symptoms of a poor/no idle.

If you cant find it, does any one know where this
link is in the
T2 library?

Subject: [T2] idle problems.....


i wrote a little while back about a bus that i was
looking at buying.
well, i bought it.  i knew beforehand that there
were some problems with the
engine, as far as it not being able to hold an
idle.  so i had the bus towed
to my house where i figured i could just spend a
few hours looking for a
loose hose somewhere.

but i haven't found anything.  i checked out all
the basic stuff first, like
points and timing and compression.  everything
checked out.

here's what happens when i start it:  i turn the
key and engine starts right
up, and as long as i have my foot on the gas it
will stay running.
as soon as i take my foot off it dies out.
sometimes it happens right away
and sometimes it happens after a second or two,
but always immediately after
taking my foot off the gas.  when this happens
there is an audible sucking
noise that comes out of the engine.  i'm sure its
a vaccum leak somewhere,
but i can't find any.  i looked in the archives
for &quot;vaccum leak&quot; advice but
they all deal with spraying something in the
engine while its running, which
i obviously can't do if it won't idle.   so what
do i do?  the PO put in a
new fuel pump, pump relay, and air flow sensor.
any help would be great....

mark.
