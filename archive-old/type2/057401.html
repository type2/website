Subject: '79 Engine in an '81

Ok,Ok.  Settle down, Beavis.  Both of you, approach this carefully.  I
smell flame war and useless list traffic brewing...

&gt;&gt;    I have no clue why you would think that not sealing the engine
&gt;&gt;compartment would have anything whatsoever to do with engine life. That
&gt;&gt;hasn't anything to do with cooling, you know? More dust in the engine
&gt;&gt;might require more frequent air filter changes I suppose, but that's
&gt;&gt;about all. In fact, if anything, the engine would run cooler.
&gt;
&gt;This is a joke, right?

Hopefully so.  But one of our jobs on this list is to educate and 
enlighten the &quot;unwashed heathen&quot;.  I think that the attitude so prevalent
on the list as of late is a bad sign, and I for one would like to be a
voice of reason if not intelligence.

Just tell the poor fool the truth about engine cooling, hot and cold air,
etc.  Put a subject line on it that makes some sense(so that it can easily
be referenced), and get on with our senseless, boring little lives.

I for one could use a little less list excitement these days.
