&gt;old heaters.  As I recall, he's reluctant to sell parts  (personally told
&gt;me he feels that they are too dangerous for average person to fool with,
&gt;and doesn't want to feel responsible if it blows up),

Nothing like a little fear to drum up business.  Eberspacher's are safe. 
Safe to a fault.  When they malfunction, they shut down and refuse to start
until fixed.  They use miniscule amounts of fuel at nearly zero pressure. 
If you use a little common sense there is nothing to fear.  

Stewart Warners are another story IMHO.  I have a pile of heaters and all
of the Eberspachers are in decent shape while many of the SW's show signs
of overheating/fire.
