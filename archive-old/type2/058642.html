Subject: shims &amp; spacers

I'm in the process of determining what cylinder spacers I need to achieve a
compression ratio of 7 for my 1776.  On page 17 of my Gene Berg catalog ,
he lists spacers and shims and I'm wondering how each is to be used.  The
obvious difference is that spacers have thicknesses of .040 and .060 and
the shims have thicknesses like .007.  Are the shims to be used in
conjunction with spacers to   set the compression ratio with great
precision?  If not, then what is their use?

Thanks, Jack
