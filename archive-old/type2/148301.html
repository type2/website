Subject: Re: [T2] 78 2.0 transplant into a 74 westy

Hi Mike,

I keep hearing everyone talk about this stuff, but I just put another
79 2.0 into another 72 3 rib tranny and didn't have to do anything to
get the shift stick to work right.

Also why can't you just keep your brake vacuum setup as is and
transfer it to the new motor?

John

 vaccume assist brakes??  Has anyone done this and have any good
