Subject: EGR Filter
Message-ID: &lt;3704DD0D.235C_at_ibm_dot_net&gt;

Hey all,
I have not disassembled one of the EGR filters, but when I shake the 2
20+ year old ones that I have - there is some black particulate matter
(carbon graphite?) from inside the filter that comes out.

That makes me concerned for hooking it up to my air intake system.

WRT the filter question: Carbon will work well due to the high temp of
the exhaust gas.  Paper would burn.  I believe the purpose is to reduce
particles that may enter the air system.

WRT removing HC's.  Carbon filters are commonly used in industrial
applications.  However, they reach a state where they have &quot;consumed&quot;
all of a pollutant (typically a HC) that they can, at that point 3
things can happen: 1) the carbon is disposed ($$) 2) the carbon is
regenerated and the HC is recaptured or 3) you have breakthrough, where
the carbon is saturated and anymore loading of HC essentially passes
through.

Due to the size of our filters, I would bet that case #3 is correct for
us, and the EGR filter is meant to minimize particles.

Think about the carbon canister on your gas tank evaporative control. 
The carbon absorbs the HC's and then a flow of relatively hot &quot;clean&quot;
air desorbs the HC's and introduces them to the air intake system.
