Subject: Re: [T2] engine numbers

From Kevin H. Roberts:

 Can anybody give me a date of manufacture if I give
you my engine number?  It has come time for me to try
to pass our city's new emissions ordinance.  It is for
'75 and later vehicles.  Mine is a 76 but has a 1700
motor.  So I call this girl in Nashville and she says
that if I'll bring a letter from the dealer stating
that the motor is from a 74 or previous year, I'll be
exempt.  The dealer signed a blank sheet and gave it
to me but wouldn't take the time to look up the
engine. I know they have that information.
 
 I'm going to write the letter but it would be nice if
I could say 'manufactured 5/73' or something specific.
I can't afford a new engine.  Thanks....KR

If you go here:
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/identifi/modvar.htm

and look at 1972, it shows this range of engine numbers:
Engine Number  CB-0-000-001  -    CB-0-056-205
[I left out the CA numbers]                         

If you engine number is between these CB numbers, you have a 72 engine. 
If you divide the total of the CB engines by 12 you get 4683.6 per month.
It should not be too hard to figure a month :)

For 73, I believe the CB number shown, 
 1973   Engine Number  CB-0-062-006
is the ending number for the year. So the beginning number would be 
CB-0-056-206 and end CB-0-062-006
