&gt;&gt; Hmmm....
&gt;&gt; Under pressure the boiling point of water drops.
&gt;&gt; 200 is the number I see. On both gauges.
&gt;
&gt; reverse is true, higher presure, higher boiling point.   some high
&gt; performance steam engines got the boiling point up near 300F by getting
&gt; presures over 250PSI

Right. Brain f*rt. That degree is Physics is wearing off.....*grin*

But, 212 obviously doesn't mean the water will boil off then, does it?
So, I am not sure of the validity of the original point that 212 is needed
to boil water out of the lubricating oil.

Or am I missing something?
