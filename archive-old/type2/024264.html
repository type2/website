Subject: Increasingly Hard Brake Pedal
Message-ID: &lt;7iet10$25j9_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

My 71 Westy recently started doing this:

After _driving_ for around 15 minutes, the brake pedal gets increasingly &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;harder&quot; - meaning it takes less and less effort to apply the brakes.  When I first start driving, the brakes seem to work normally.

Note I do not believe this to be vacuum assist-related, as I had that device fail around two years ago and replaced it.  The symptom was totally different.

If I continue to drive past the 15 minutes, the pedal gets harder and harder, and the brakes begin to drag very noticeably.  I have inspected the front discs and everything looks fine.  I realize there's more to it than a visual inspection, but the pads have plenty of life and the rotors look normal.

I suspect either a problem with the rear brakes or the master cylinder or other brake &quot;plumbing&quot;.  I think a major clue may be the way the problem acts up after driving, but I don't know how to interpret that.  Anyone see this before?
