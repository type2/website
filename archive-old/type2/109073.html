Subject: Re: [T2] Generator for 71 Single Cab 1600

From: &quot;Karl&quot; &lt;aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Sounds like you have a bug mounting plate for the bug 30A generator. The
bus plate is dished for the longer
&gt; 38A bus generator. It is the correct one for a 71....
&gt;
Does anyone know of a pic of this bus plate?  I am running a doghouse oil
cooler on my single cab and the fan is right at the back of the shroud.  I
don't understand how a dished backing plate or anything else on the back
would make the GR17X fit. Does it allow the gen to sit farther back some
how?   The GR17X is too &quot;long&quot;.  The GR15X is what I took off and have found
a friend in town with one that will part with it  :)  I am just trying to
understand what y'all are talking about.

Thanks for the help..
Snoopy
