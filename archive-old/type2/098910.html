Subject: RE: [T2] Was 'Synthetic Oil; Now - Engine Diagnostics

Check your pressure and bypass regulator pistons and springs. Make sure the
pistons are not sticking. People have stretched the spring or installed new
ones to increase oil pressure. Also check the oil pump. Those are the first
things that I would look at.
