Subject: more on so where

Thanks Joel.  I kind of figured that the engine would be a good place to 
begin.  When I was looking at the engine today, I was discouraged 
because of all the apparent rust... although the engine carrier still 
had the vw mud flaps attached.  I'll retreive that some time this week 
and try to figure out how I'm gonna take that apart.  I have no garage 
but a back yard shed should do well. 

I'm assuming that if I wanted to buy engine &quot;tin&quot; its available 
somewhere??

Man, my banker will love me... my wife... another story!!
