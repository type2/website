Subject: Input on Conti reinforced 185s

I see a lot of input on Michelin, and if I could get some, I'd be there
too...again...but they're never in stock anywhere up here, or sold-out
quickly....so I broke down &amp; bought a pair of Continentals....not the
car, the tires &lt;GRIN&gt;

Has anyone had any luck with them???

Looking for input before I buy the other two.

Thanks, Den.
