&gt; I am the owner of an aircooled 2.0L VW Transporter and all this talk about
&gt; heaters as has prompted me to tell the Type2 list about my home made
&gt; heater. It uses water to transfere the heat from the engine to the insideof
&gt; the van. There was some disscusion about it on the Vanagon list earlier
&gt; this year. I have made some improvements since then and I am still very
&gt; happy with it. I'll go into more detail about how it works if anyone is
&gt; interested.

ttfn,
