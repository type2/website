Howdy......I had a similar situation w my 71. What seemed to be the cure was 
a liberal dose of spray carb cleaner: down the throat, in the air mixture 
screw holes, and in the diagonal tube that (I think) leads to the 
accelerator pump (bug spray carb). No problem since.
Good Luck

Help. I have read everything in the archives on this. I have backfire on
deceleration (downshift) not at any other time.  I have gone through the
entire exhaust, new german muffler, new heat exhchangers, pulled and put on
new gaskets doughnuts, etc. Exhaust is clean and good. (69 T2 with bug
exhaust, stock setup, vacuum advance dist.). I don't think its an exhaust
leak. Engine is good strong runner. I enriched the mixture on several
occasions, most recently when I went through the whole exhaust set-up. It
seemed to make the situation worse. Timing seems to be spot on (no run-on,
etc.) I've monkeyed with this so many times and can't stop it. Can an intake
leak cause this problem. I am desperate
