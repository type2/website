&gt; Hi listees,
&gt; When decelerating and down shifting, I am getting the rapid popping sound from
&gt; the rear. From my experience with this list, I know that the most common cause
&gt; is an exhaust leak. My question is: If I had an exhaust leak that was too
&gt; small to be noisy or heard, could it still cause this problem? Also, what are
&gt; the other common causes?
&gt; Thanks in advance for the help.

You might to search the archives.  I recently had this problem, and it was
caused by a combination of damaged intake manifold gasket and a leaking
power brake vacuum hose.  Look for leaks everywhere.
