&gt;so, how can i tell what kind of a/c unit i have if the compressor is missing?

In the late westy, there are AFAIK 2 main installs, the VW Cool system
and the DPD, I've owned both.  These are both under dash units.  The DPD
will say DPD on it.  The VW does not say anything.  The DPD has 2 seperate
blowers and knobs to control them individually and a temp knob.  The VW
has one blower, one blower knob, one temp know.  The DPD is a much
superior unit FWIW.  The DPD is also more symetrical under the dash the
VW is sort of mostly on the passenger side and contoured a bit more.
The DPD tended to have one condensor centrally under the bus
covered with a heavy duty louvered steel panel, the VW has one mounted
annoyingly at the front beam, and another central under the bus, usually
both covered with crappy expanded stainless steel mesh.  The one glory
of the VW install is that the compressor mount and adjustement is superior.
Both use crappy ole York style compressors.  Actually restoring either to
functional status using that York compressor isn't a really spectacular
thought
in a heavy ole Bus westy.  But the VW one will blow the sweat off your
crotch (and I mean that most literally it is the only place it effectively
blows)
and keep the front passengers maybe 80F on a 95F day, the DPD does
much better.  David S. says his install using a modern compressor does
much better but I don't know if he has an underdash or a overhead (not
installed in Westy cause of cutout.)  Both will probably reduce engine life
unless you turn em off going up hills under heavy load on a hot day (gee
aren't you glad you got it?) though the '78 did have 160k or so on the
original engine and the air worked at least 120k of those miles.  A real
side benefit and treat of the underdash units is that they make any normal
easy under dash work (installing a radio, removing the cluster to replace
a bulb or speedo cable, whatever) into a day long knuckle grazing, teeth
knashing, all out cursing fit.  And the location of the VW front condensor
effectively prevents any chance at ebrake cable adjustment.

If you want a compressor I think I have one from a DPD install, and one from
a VW install, condition of either totally unknown, and not worth shipping.
If near WV, come and get one.
