&gt;that will not tell you definitely. someone may have used solid lifter pushrods with the hydraulic lifters.
&gt;
&gt;it has happened. only way to be certain? look at the lifter itself.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;so when i get the pushrods out then i can try to see &gt;if a magnet sticks to them or not ?
&gt;&gt;and when and if the magnet does stick this means &gt;that they are hydraulic lifters...?
