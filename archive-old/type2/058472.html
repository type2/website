Subject: Re: Multimeter

&gt;  I am putting a page up at my place to give some
&gt;basic multimeter usage info to those that have not
&gt;used one. here  is the URL.
&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt; http://www.geocities_dot_com/MotorCity/Speedway/1974/volts.htm &gt;&gt;&gt;

This is good and it is sorely needed. Thanks for doing it.

&gt;You can pick up a VOM (volt/ohm/meter) for $14.00 to $500.00.
&gt;I like the analog meter which is the one with the
&gt;needle indicator for checking out stuff on my bus as
&gt;the digital readout meters readout bounce around and is way
&gt;to precise for what you want when checking for shorts,
&gt;device integrity, and the presence of voltage on a bus.

You're probably right, but a lot of us popped up to Radio Shack where they
will sell you a wonderfully small digital meter for $18 or an amazingly
small one for $25. The nice thing about the digital ones besides their tiny
size is that they auto-select the range. I don't know how to use an analog
meter and choosing a range is intimidating if you don't understand what a
range even *is*.

Maybe there could be a note in the margin where the analog procedure
differs from the digital one (for instance you don't select the range with
a digital, and continuity is indicated by a beep rather than a notation).

Also maybe a hypothetical common bus elec problem and how it might be
solved, i.e. right rear turn signal works but left does not even though the
bulb looks fine, my meter and its novice owner went through that this week.
8) Just a thought.
