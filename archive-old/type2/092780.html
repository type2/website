--=====================_8138722==_.ALT

You can also use an electronic ignition system (coil and vacuum advance 
distributor) from an aircooled Vanagon.

1979-1983.5 I believe (and yes I know the first year is still a baywindow).

The advantage is that you can get replacement parts about anywhere which 
can be difficult when you are looking for a replacement for a Petronix or 
whatever. Of course you should carry a replacement set of points and 
condenser.

I see prices of $75 for junkyard or swapmeet VW electronic ignition systems 
and I hear the Petronix Ignitor II is the one you want if you go that 
route. Be careful of it's voltage requirements, low voltage can introduce 
alot of tuning gremlins and high voltage (either version I or version II 
requires less than 12 volts) will burn it out.

I'd put that Petronix in a stock vacuum advance distributor. I think 
&lt;http://www.aircooled_dot_net/&gt;www&lt;http://www.aircooled_dot_net/&gt;.Aircooled_dot_net or 
maybe www.Oldvolkshome_dot_com  has an application chart  for which distributor 
you need.
