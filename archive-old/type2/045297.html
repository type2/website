Subject: [T2] Re: [VB] roof insulation..

Go to McMaster-Carr and get some of their thermal insulation.

Some people have also used that bubble-foil stuff, which is really 
reasonable.  

Paint th ebus a different color - I noticed a TREMENDOUS difference between
the temp inside the westy and the panel - and the westy had the windows
and doors open!

&gt; that duct tape and fiberglass up there looking crappy.
