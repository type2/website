Subject: [T2] Need Donor Pop Top


&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; I'm looking for a pop top, cheap or better yet free.  Any year (68-79),
&gt; any
&gt; condition, only need the large piece.  Prefer damaged, dirty or both,
&gt; whatever, is fine, I'd just rather not use one in real nice shape.  I'm
&gt; working on a single cab project and am interested in the top horizontal
&gt; section with the molded in ribs, I have no need for the vertical sides
&gt; (well maybe the rear/front vertical piece).  I'd be cutting out the
&gt; portion I need and fiber glassing in some new pieces to make it fit a
&gt; single cab (as a bed cover).
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Chad Sibert
