Subject: save a plastic cow
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

We recently recovered our '80 Westy with beautiful updated upholstery.  In
our comfort quest, we were driven by both our frugal nature and our desire
to landfill as little as possible.  Like most Westies, the upholstery on our
front seats was threadbare and dangling from the rusty springs of the seat
back.  The pleather (plastic leather) on the seat backs and the seat bottom
sides, however,
was in perfect condition!  We decided to save the pleather.  We found enough
upholstery in the remnant bin to easily cover our front seats(about 2
yards).  On the advice of another post, we also bought some foam rubber, 1
in. thick, to cover the seat backs.  A few hours and $20 later, we have seat
covers that fit like stock but are far more attractive.  If anyone is
interested in recovering their seats and would like instructions on the
process we would be happy to oblige.  The only equipment required is a
sewing machine.

Diana and John
