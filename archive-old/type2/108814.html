Subject: RE: [T2] '80 Vanagon Bumpers - Virginia area

&gt; I called the PO and the Previous PO. 
&gt; The list is too much to put here.  Some stuff from Bus Depot 
&gt; (still has receipts)  But most amazing, he gave me a Vanagon backing 
&gt; plate.  NEW.  And everything on it is NEW!!!  Like the self adjuster,
&gt; the springs, the emergency brake cable, etc.  It sure looks pretty.
But I 
&gt; only got one...


I'm sure he got that from me as well; I had a really cheap closeout on
them about a year ago. Alas, only one side. I never did find any of the
other side. :-(
