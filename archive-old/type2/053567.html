This sounds bad for air cooled heads.  Wasn't Mark
Stevens considered the best for heads?  Who else will
have as long a guarantee on dropped seats?  Gee, maybe
I can't keep my 1980 Westie going through this next
millenium at a reasonable price.  Are they making any
Type 4 parts in South America?

&gt; &gt; Why not try Mark Stephens.  It seems that there
&gt; are rumors of his
&gt; company's
&gt; &gt; demise and they might have a tool or two for sale.
&gt; &gt; His web site is still down and last month there
&gt; were reports of no one
&gt; being
&gt; &gt; home out there.
