Subject: [T2] Trip Report

Hi Volks,
   I want to let everyone, especially AIRS members, know that Kathy and I 
successfully made our round trip to Michigan and back to Long Island, New 
York this past week.  Even though I didn't have to call any AIRS members for 
help, it sure was a nice to know I could if I had to.  Thank you to all AIRS 
members, where ever you are.
   Our 71 westy ran fine for a little over 2000 miles this past week.  We 
did experience the hot start problem a few times, so the starter will be 
coming out soon for a good cleaning and inspection.  One morning the engine 
shut down just a few minutes after starting.  It was sudden, just as if it 
was shut off.  Seemed like an electrical problem to me, so I opened the 
distributor cap and had a look see.  Everything was OK, so I closed it up, 
checked for spark and got a good hot one, then tried to start it back up.  
It started on the first try and ran fine the rest of the time since.  Gas 
mileage was 23.7 mpg, and I did have to add  1/2 a quart of oil during the 
trip.  I guess the biggest problem we had is that the plumbing for the sink 
drain started leaking in the cabinet and got the surrounding floor wet.
   Most of the driving to get to Michigan and back was on hiways 80, 23, and 
75.  As you can guess, we were the slowest thing on the roads.  Most other 
drivers seemed to just go past us and on their way.  In western PA we did 
have one New York driver lay on the horn as he followed very close behind us 
and then passed, but even more people gave us a smile and a wave.  Of course 
as we were driving around lower Michigan for a week many young people 
pointed and waved as we drove by.  I'm sure some of them had never seen a 
bus before.  One young lady had a real laugh as she checked us into a camp 
ground.  Part of the paper work asked for vehicle make, model and year.  
When she asked for the year I said I thought the bus was older than her and 
asked what year she was born.  Her replay was &quot;85, when I told her the VW 
came out of the factory in 71 we laughed for 5 minutes, at least.  I've got 
to say, that there seemed to be a real lack of buses and a/c VW's in 
particular in and around Flint, MI.  Yeah, yeah, I know, MI is  the  capital 
of the US automotive industry.
   While we were there we did get to meet John H. , list and AIRS member.  
Of course since he too has a 71 westy we each had to inspect the other guys 
bus.  I sure wish I had his interior.  Over a cold beer our wives decided 
that there must be some common traits in folks that want to own old VWs.  
They talked about making up a questionaire for list members to find out what 
it is we all have in common.  Personally, I call it class!
    Also on this trip our bus revealed it’s name to us.  It’s now called 
John Dear.  You see, I just gave it a quick coat of paint a few weeks ago, 
and the color was called John Deere Green.   So when you see us, don’t 
forget to ask how John is doing.
   All in all the trip was a great success and adventure.  This is the 
farthest we’ve ever been by bus and were prepared for all sorts of problems. 
  I’m sure glad we didn’t have any.
