&gt; Hi Courtney,
&gt;
&gt; May I suggest something different?  If this is your vacation, get off the
&gt; dismal turnpike of Hwy 80 and drop down to Hwy 50, which is the only true way
&gt; to experience the space of Nevada.  Called the 'loneliest highway in America',
&gt; Hwy 50 is what driving the American West is all about: miles and miles of
&gt; desert and salt flats, the occasional cow, small cowboy towns, glorious space.
&gt; No Wal-Marts, no Starbucks, no truck stops, no Super 8, no homogenization.
&gt; Just a lone remaining stretch of refreshing idiosyncracy.  For a place to
&gt; stop, you might consider Eureka.  I was through there a few years ago, and it
&gt; hadn't changed much since the time I worked on a ranch near there in the 60s.
&gt; There was still a bar that served great steak sandwiches.  Someone had taken
&gt; over the old ramshackle hotel and was renting the quaintly old-fashioned rooms
&gt; to travelers.  You won't be sorry.  Or maybe you will, but you won't forget
&gt; it.

I will second that recommendation.  I-80 is for truck drivers who want to
set the cruise control and crawl back into the sleeper for a few hours.
It makes watching paint dry seem exciting.

US50, on the other hand, goes &quot;across the grain&quot;, crossing valleys and
going over mountains, which makes the trip much more interesting.  The
little towns (in their state of &quot;arrested decay&quot; according to a literate
friend) add spice to the trip.

I suggest going south from SLC and picking up US6 south of Provo.  This
will become US50, pass through Delta and on to Ely.  Along the way you can
stop off at Great Basin National Park and tour Lehman Caves.  In East Ely,
you can tour the Railroad Museum, a shoestring operation that nevertheless
has some of the finest last-generation steam engines in existence.  Ely
used to be a copper mining town and you can see the Ruth pit if you are
into large holes in the ground.

Moving on, you will next reach Eureka, a mining town (as most towns in
Nevada are).  A couple of good places to stay, including a restored
original hotel that is rather quaint.  Best place to eat is the Owl
Cafe and bar.

Further west, you come across Austin.  Be very careful on the downhill
into Austin, as it has captured more than its share of victims.  Slow and
careful, even in modern cars!.  Best place to stay in Austin is the
Lincoln Motel, but don't expect the Ritz.  As I recall, you could use the
pot and wash your hands simultaneously in their efficiently-designed
bathrooms.  Austin has the wonderful Stokes Castle, which is only
wonderful if you are groping about for a tourist attraction!  :)

Moving along, you will have the choice of continuing on US50 or switching
to NV722.  50 is easier but 722 is more interesting and they both end up
in Middlegate.  Stop off at the Cold Springs Pony Express station for a
bit of history.  The Middlegate store had decent sandwiches the last time
I was by.

As you move on, you will see the ghost town of Wonder off the the right in
the foothills.  Further along you will see a turnoff for Dixie Valley,
which is only remarkable because I spent part of my childhood there.
Nothing there now, since it is an electronic warfare range.
Your GPS might show some funny readings along this stretch!

Despite the desert location, you are now in US Navy territory, as the
entire airspace over this part of the state is the Top Gun training area
(to the dismay of many fighter pilots who expected the beaches of
Miramar!)  Expect to see low-flying aircraft and remember, that isn't Jet
Noise, it's the Sound of Freedom!  On the left you will pass Salt Wells,
which used to be a pretty good restaurant, but lately has been converted
to a house of ill repute (which is perfectly legal in this part of the
state).

The next town is Fallon, this one agricultural.  Alfalfa and cantaloupes
are both grown here in quantity.  Also mosquitos.  Fallon is a fairly
large town by local standards, so you will see Wal-marts and similarly
abberant things.

&gt;From Fallon, you head toward Fernley, and then you have to pick up I-80
for the final blast into Reno.  Down in the canyon, after you go past
Vista, you can see the now-defunct Mustang Ranch.  Alternately, you can
stay on US50 to Carson City and then go north to Reno on US395 or
continue on to Sacramento on US50.

Now the warnings:

1. DO NOT EVER *EVER* DRIVE THIS ROAD AT NIGHT!!!
Sorry for screaming, but the road is all open range, which means that
cattle are grazed without fencing.  Running into 2000 pounds of Black
Angus steer will destroy any vehicle, including huge pickups with heavy
duty bull bars on the front (don't ask how I know!)  Dusk and dawn are
particularly dangerous as the livestock and wildlife are moving toward
water at those times.  Even a 200 pound mule deer will ruin your trip.

2. Fuel up in Ely and Fallon.  You will get reamed if you fuel in
Austin or Eureka.

3. Drive at a sensible pace.  The nearest medical aid is in Reno or Elko,
and you don't want to pay for the medevac!  Similarly, auto repair is
pretty thin along this route.  Most folks drive Chevys or Dodges, so our
furrin' cars are pretty odd to them.

4. Exploring off-pavement can be fun, but remember that you are way out
in the boonies.  Your survival is your problem, and there is no Ranger Bob
out there to bail you out.  Take along ample supplies and at least two
spare tires.  Check out the local pickups and you'll see at least two
spares in the bed of just about every truck, and they don't even bother to
stow them away they get used so often.


Have a great trip!
