Subject: Re: Jacks/jackstands vs ramps

Not all of us have lifts, but most do have jacks and jackstands.  True, 
Use of jacks and jackstands requires level ground.  However, ramps are 
much safer than stands if used properly.  I set the jacks tight under 
the wheels and sight down the stand along the car side.  The plastic 
ones are wider than the steel ones- but the latter have indents in the 
side and rear to center the tire.  Once I sight the driver side ramp, I 
back up until it just touches the &quot;hump&quot;.  Then get out and check the 
other ramp-is it centered and nearly touching the hump?  Then I block 
the front wheels.  On my drive this produces a nearly level bus for rear 
work. For an oil change on a level surface, one does not need to jack up 
the bus.   To produce a raised LEVEL bus - on a level surface- I will 
level the vehicle by ramping the rear, then jacking up the front, 
placing stands, lower onto the stands,and leaving the jack in place just 
tightened up.  I was so poor in graduate school I made my own ramps from 
3/4&quot; plywood, Using upright pieces of studs nailed to top and bottom 
pieces of ply (angles cut on chop saw); racking was prevented by 
triangulation.

     This sounds like a recipe for disaster!!!!!! First rule of jacking up
  any car/truck, for anything, LEVEL HARD SURFACE, &quot;NO EXCEPTIONS&quot;! 
Don't let
  your first oil change be your last.
      Another thing, IMHO, I don't think much of those drive on ramps, since
  you can only really see the left one, its to easy to get off center on the
  other and have one roll over.
