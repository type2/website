Subject: dead battery leads to broken wire (still dead)

I don't think this has anything to do with my battery problem, but maybe it 
does.
Remember the front of the engine compartment is towards the front of the bus 
and the rear is closest to the hatch.
So, if I follow the wire on the battery cable for the extra battery to run 
the camper equipment (I don't have a battery installed) and it goes to a box 
right next to the hatch on the rear wall of the engine compartment on the 
same side as the spare battery. There are a bunch of wires plugged into this 
box. two of the wires (one red and one black) are inside seperate sheathes 
which are then run through a larger sheathe together. You can follow this 
sheathe across the top rear of the engine compartment and up to the front 
passenger side of the engine compartment. Here the plack wire feeds into a 
box. The red wire is broken.
Where should this wire attach?
Is this why my other battery won't hold a charge? probably not, huh?
Well, as always all advice is appreciated.
Thanks,
Kyle
