Subject: vdo rant

Awful quiet week for the list.  Seems like a good time for my VDO rant.
  
  After igoring sage advice from Karl, et. al., about the unreliability  of VDO oil temp guages, I bought the dipstick sensor type a year or so  ago.  Always read too high.  The finger-on-the-dipstick test  confirmed this.  But the real problem was that I found out that  the biggest part of my oil leak was coming out of the dipstick.   That thing just wouldn't seal.
  
  So then I decided to order the sender for the taco plate.  After  much hunting, planning, drilling, tapping, etc., I got it in.   Again, unreliably high readings.  And when you turn the headlights  on it maxes out.  Then it decided to stop working for a week or  so.  Then it starts working again.  All the way to the left  when cold, 180 to 200 around town, sometimes tipping 220 on the  freeway.  Quite acceptable and believable.  Then the other  day I'd driven around town for a while and I looked down and AYE AYE,  275!  I didn't believe it.  Dipstick test was fine.  I  let her sit for 4 hours.  Got back in and it read 140 cold.   I didn't do well in thermodynamics but I do know that's  impossible.  So a couple of more days go by and I'm back to what I  think are good readings.  Who knows what today will bring.
  
  Moral of the story:  don't buy VDO oil temp guages if you care  anything about knowing what your oil temps are.  They're  crap.  If you can't afford the Dakota Digital or the nice  aircraft-quality guages recently posted here (aircraftspruce_dot_com), just  wait and save your money.  The VDO's are a PITA and they don't  work.  The dipstick senders are great if you like blowing out a  quart of oil every week  Take my advice, fuggedaboudit.  
  
  Cheers....KR
