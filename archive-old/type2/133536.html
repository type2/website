&gt; &gt; Does the hitch attach to the engine carrier bar and the bumper?  ... This
&gt; is a draw tite hitch or imitation. Let me know. I have one and it's good for
&gt; pulling a bike trailer or real small boat.
&gt;
&gt; My '77 has a sort of bar running just under the edge of the lip of the body
&gt; below the engine hatch.  It's not attached to that body lip, just attached
&gt; at the ends somehow.  Let me look at the fiches for a minute...

I some dozen or so years ago bought a clamp on hitch from a trailer rental
company going out of business, dang thing weighs a ton, but I have towed a
fully loaded U-haul full of junk from the house to the dump.. had to take
it real easy but it worked.
