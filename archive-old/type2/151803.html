Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Wind Shield - Window Removal

Larry,

Much easier(at least for me) because of the amount of pressure that has to 
be exerted to cut thru the rubber.  

Would you rather be wielding a razor knife on the outside of the window
or trying to keep it from slipping on the inside and leaving a 12&quot; gash in 
your headliner or dash?

On the outside, I can hold it with both hands to guide it...on the inside( 
for a 6' 4&quot; guy that is a little more difficult.

Cheers, dave

 Razor knife is used from the outside slid down into the area between the
 glass and rubber....cut all the way around and remove the seal part that
 you cut....then *gently* push outward from the inside as the rest of the
 seal lets go of  the glass.
