Subject: Fuel Tank Cleaning was Re:Filtering fuel

1. Disconnect all 4 shocks
2. Drain fuel
3. Remove drain fitting (only on stock carb fuel tanks)
4. Remove fill cap
5. Insert garden hose and turn on full monty
6. Plug outlet with thumb or what have you until tank is full
7. Open outlet and shake that chassis like crazy from side to side as 
water drains out and a whole lot of particulate rust and such rushes 
out. This won't work very well with the shock in play which is why 
you remove them. LOTS more action.
8. Shut off hose and continue shaking until the tank is empty.
9. Hook up an exhaust hose from another vehicle from the exhaust to 
the tank fill. Run at idle or better for half an hour to dry the tank.
10. Install drain screen and fitting, hose and fill tank.

Even on a tank with lot of crud, this will get you back to running 
for several years before the rust flakes return. It will get danged 
near anything loose in there out and you can go back to normal fuel 
filter replacement. Don't forget to follow up by removing the carb/s 
and cleaning out the bowls.
