Subject: Re: [T2] Engine replacement (long)

Rob,

I have had bad luck with Mark Stephens, AVP, and GEX.  That covers the
three engines that I have bought pre-rebuilt.  The list wisdom is that
Jake Raby and Bob Donalds are good, but at this point I am suspicious of
all of them.

On buying a factory new engine... I *wish* there were any factory fresh T4
engines laying on pallets in a warehouse somewhere!  So far, tho, that
does not seem to be the case, even for Ron who has searched Europe for
parts. (Ron... *please* tell me I am wrong :-)  VW will still sell you a
rebuilt, BTW, from VW of Canada.  Their price is high, about $2,000, and I
have never heard of anyone actually buying one, but I am considering it.
Part of the reason being that the rebuild may not be any better than
anyone elses, but their &quot;availability of service&quot; cannot be beaten!
