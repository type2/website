&gt;The archives and library tell me how to diagnose failed injectors, but
&gt;offer no information on how often they might be expected to fail. Any
&gt;mechanics out there with enough engine experience to tell me what a
&gt;reasonable lifespan for a fuel injector is?


Depends largely on a number of extraneous factors, how clean your gas is,
how much the car is used (sitting without running is not good for
injectors), how often you change your fuel filter, etc.  I've had no
problems with injectors in buses I used only a few months out of year,
origional '76-'78 vintage injectors.  I've also had 3 sieze in nearly no
time at all after letting a bus sit for a month presumeably with watery gas.
So generally, if you don't use the thing, run a fuel stabilizer, and if you
do have to replace them please note that around me Autozone or Advanced Auto
(2 chain places out of the south east) sell brand NEW injectors for $30
each.  The new style with the improved tip that is supposed to keep the
injectors clean longer and better.  They are Lucas made (Bosch bought Lucas
apparently though, so no jokes) and work very nicely, but don't fit
&quot;perfectly&quot; as the new injector tips are a bit shorter so they don't seat
quite as well.  Not a problem but you won't get by using them with old seals
(but new ones are included anyway.)  For $120 a set, not all that bad to
just replace along with your fuel lines, you all do replace those fuel lines
every 5 years don't you.  The new injectors save the hassle of replacing the
lines on the old ones, and give you a bit of confidence that all cylinders
are getting as much fuel as they are supposed to, balanced well and whatnot.
