Hello All,

I am converting my 81 vanagon from fuel injection to dual weber34s.
We have the fuel injection removed and are at the point to start 
installing the manifolds.  The instructions are extremely vague.  
There is a threaded hole on both manifolds just under where the carbs 
mount onto the manifolds and we do not know what needs to be connected 
there.  The instructions say nothing about it at all.  Has anyone out 
there performed this conversion and can give me some advice as to what 
to do?  Also, does the hoses from the charcoal filter need to be 
reconnected to anything?  The instructions leave many questions 
un-answered.  Any help would be great.
