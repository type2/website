It wasn't a shorted power lead, or at least not a big one like you
described.  I immediately ran to the engine compartment and checked the
battery cable-both were cool and on very tightly.  That's what stumped me.
I thought the same thing as you: &quot;Must be a short somewhere.&quot;

But, if that's it, I can't find it.  I finally took it to the shop about
an hour ago, hopefully they can find it.
