Subject: Re: Husbands, Busses and Obsession

...Think busses are an obsession? (OK, so I've got two.) I've got a Morgan in 
my base-
ment that I'm rebuilding ('62 4/4, I've got a big basement). In addition to 
the usual
manuals and picture/history books, I've also got &quot;The Morgan Driver's Bedside 
Reader&quot;.
