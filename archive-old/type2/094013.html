Subject: Bussin' Away...

Had to leave the house early today, to get some gas 
for Speedy, and a venti Caramel Macchiatto for me.  
It's a nice mild day in Costa Mesa today.  Friday 
requires I wear my sooper-loud hawaiian shirt.

Cruising down Fairview, onto 405 South, traffic's 
kinda light, some lady in an Excursion won't let me 
in.  Oh, she's on the phone.  No matter, point the 
right foot through 3rd, grab 4th, she's in my mirror.

Move to the middle lane, Scooby wrigglin' on the dash, 
Deacon Blue's mellowing me back out, oops, 80 is a bit 
too fast for the ride to work!  Back off, slip into 
the next lane, cruise 70 past the big semis, sip 
coffee-like stuff.  Enjoy the morning.  Enjoy the 
sound of the 1915 behind me.

Three buddies going to grab fish tacos for lunch in 
the bus, today's gonna be a great day.

Enjoy your busses, anyway they are.


Later,

Simon
