Replacing the heater tube under the cargo floor in a loaf...

I've not done this my self but I know of people who have replaced this tube
with plastic guttering down pipe. I'm told the size is just right.

As for insulation I've just succesfully insulated the front section of my 
heater tube using closed cell foam from an old camping mat held on with duct
tape.
