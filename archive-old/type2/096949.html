Subject: Rear axle swap?


Today , I removed the rear axles on my 71 camper and before I replace 
them, I wondered if there is any benefit (wear &amp;tear) to either reversing an axle (wheel/transmission  CV joint) on  the side it was removed from or swapping the axles from driver to passenger side.?  There are also a few other combinations I could try.  The last choice would be to leave them in the same position they were in when I removed them.

Thanks for your suggestions,

Joe Delecki
