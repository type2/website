Someone please provide a more precise definition/location of the part being
described so I can inspect mine.

TIA,

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Ok , i pulled my busted transmission that kept me from camping at EB. As
I
&gt; &gt;suspected , the long bracket that holds the Selector link had broken  .
This
&gt; &gt;has happened before in another bus I owned, How common is this? I have a
&gt; &gt;bracket i can use from one of my spare trannies but i need to locate
another
&gt; &gt;one so that my spare is still functional. Any one know where i can get
one?
&gt; &gt;Would welding it back togeather be a viable option?
&gt;
&gt; Common problem, caused by forcing the shifter to engage gears.
&gt; Simple repair, dealer part, $20. Welding is also possible and effective
repair.
