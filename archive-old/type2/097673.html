Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Calipers Binding (kind of long)

Yes, the rubber is all new... installed by PO.  He run the rubber lines
straight from wheel well.  I noticed where there is supposed to be a metal
line coming from the wheel well to a bracket and then rubber from the
bracket to the caliper.  Could this extra length of rubber cause part of the
problem?

&gt; Did you install new rubber flex brake lines, they swell and close up
&gt; with age.
&gt; Not allowing the fluid to return thus holding the brakes on.
&gt; P &amp; C
&gt;
&gt;  the brake calipers were shot and were sticking
&gt;  closed.   Fast-forward a couple months... I got
&gt;  the new calipers installed
