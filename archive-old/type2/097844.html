Subject: Re: [T2] body/paint work Price

Brandt:

Regardless of price, it is just hard to find someone to take on a typical VW 
Bus project.  I got burned when I put $2,000 down and they guy went out of 
business.  If I were to do it again, I would pay the extra money and go to 
someone more reliable.

&gt; Hello list,
&gt; 
&gt; I will get back my 78 Westfalia body on Friday. I have yet to see it 
&gt; painted, but can't wait.
&gt; 
&gt; I was wondering what other people have paid for body and paint work? My 
&gt; bill 
&gt; is just under $5k and a little below the estimate and far below other 
&gt; estimates. How does this compare?
&gt; 
&gt; I liked the guy who did the work and was pleased with the results I saw 
&gt; prior to painting. My bus (Vegas Bus) had no rust but some dents mainly in 
&gt; the nose (not replaced, but pulled and fixed) and a half dozen other minor 
&gt; dents. He also replaced the worn out lower sliding door track by cutting 
&gt; out 
&gt; the strip from above and replacing it with a heavier gauge of strip metal, 
&gt; which looks stronger than new. He painted the engine compartment plus a few 
&gt; select spots inside. I dropped off the bus in June as a body. No glass, no 
&gt; rubber, no gas tank, engine/trans, no pop-top, and no interior including 
&gt; dash. Just a body.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway I'm just wondering what others have paid even though It won't change 
&gt; anything for me. Except maybe make me feel like I got a good or fair deal. 
&gt; I 
&gt; just hope I have not asked a question committing me to a lifetime doom, 
&gt; misery, and regret and that I have actually paid too much.
&gt; 
&gt; As always thanks,
&gt;
