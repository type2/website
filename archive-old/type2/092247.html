Subject: Re: [T2] CV problem

How does one break a CV joint??
Re trying to use a puller-
Rotate?  You mean the shaft is still attached to the trans by the other
CV??  Take off the whole axle, place it in a large vise so the serrated
part of the CV Jnt is resting on the vise.  Make sure that you remove
the large snapring.  May help to heat both and see if you can suck some
wax in there.  Get a sledge hammer and find anything to act as a punch
to beat on the axle itself.  Conversely, make a slide hammer rig by
taking a weight lifting weight and sliding it on the axle against the
serrated center of the joint if one CV is off..  This requires a vise
that really can grip the axle.  Heck, I've separated them by using TWO
sledges tapped on opposite sides.
