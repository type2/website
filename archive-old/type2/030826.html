Subject: Broken shock mount ('77)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.HPP.3.91.991019150430.29243A_at_cmr.sph.unc_dot_edu&gt;

I have to finally admit that my camper ('77 w/280K) is old, not just 
aging...

The piece of the frame on which a nut is welded has broken off. The top 
bolt on my rear shock just spins without unscrewing... I am actively 
trying to get the bolt out--I can't grab the nut end with a wrench or 
vice grips; I'll probably have to cut it off.

Does anyone have suggestions for repair? Instead of welding the a frame 
support back on, I was thinking of welding a bolt in there and then 
attaching the shock with a nut...

Comments welcome.
