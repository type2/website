DISCLAIMER: Please let's don't start a FART about mechanics' knowledge
vs. Listees' wisdom. ;-)

The good news: My engine's not toast. Wolfgang tells me it's got good
compression all around.

The bad news: My valve adjustment did not get high marks -- they said
the #1 exhaust valve had no clearance. When I protested that I did it by
the book, they said I must have one of those distributor caps where the
settings are off the mark. Which makes no sense to me! I checked the
mark by tracking the plug wires from the distributor cap to their
respective spark plugs. When I went to adjust the valves, I checked the
clearances first and the intakes were all around .006&quot; before I even
touched anything! Tell me I'm not crazy -- but this seemed the best
lo-tech way to ensure I was starting off alright.

Also, they had to put the dreaded insert in the #3 plug, and almost had
to put one in the #1 but the extant threads cleaned up nicely enough.
Now, I've always perceived this as a bad omen for the engine in the long
run -- am I overreacting? Or should I start looking for another engine?

Nikki
