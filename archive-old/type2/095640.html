Subject: RE: [T2] Battery Isolator Problem

&gt; Do yourself a favor.  Return the isolator and get a high-power relay that
&gt; is simply wired to the ignition so that it will connect the
&gt; batteries when the key is on.  The relay is available at Camping World and
other
&gt; places.  Plenty of info in the archives on this too.


That's basically the same as the Hella Dual Battery Kit I sell for $18.95
(part # 1738).  It's a kit consisting of an appropriately rated relay (with
integrated fuse and holder), wiring, and instructions.  Pretty much the same
setup that was used on Westfalia campers that were factory equipped with
dual batteries.  Simple yet effective.
