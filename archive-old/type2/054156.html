Subject: Re: Gen light glows

&gt;On my 61, yesterday the generator light started acting up... its wierd.
&gt;At low RPM's the light is off.  As soon as i get to highway spped its
&gt;glowing softly.  As soon as the rpms drop, it goes off again.  the bus
&gt;appears to be charging just fine, its wierd for sure.
&gt;My only 2 guesses are the brushes in the gen itself are going bad, but
&gt;that wouldnt explain why it still charges... My other guess is that there
&gt;is a short in the indicator circuit of the regulator but not the charging
&gt;circuit...
&gt;anyone else have any ideas? is this a classic symptom of ____?
&gt;thanks,
&gt;Steve

You're right!  This is a classic symptom of excessive resistance in the
electrical system.
The warning light on generator systems compares gen voltage to batt voltage.
If the gen voltage is low or not there, the light burns bright.
However, if the batt voltage is lower than gen voltage, the light will glow.
In your case, I'll bet your gen is charging okay and you have a bad
connection somewhere
which is lowering the batt voltage.  Maybe wiring connections, ign switch,
or the like.

Hope this helps
