Subject: Re: Africa Stories?

 I could use a few Africa/bush stories. From supplies to parts et al.
How does a type 2 handle a rhino?     west

&gt;I don't know if anyone's interested, but I have a friend that I just
&gt;discovered something new about. In the late 70's, turns out he was quite
&gt;the type 2 fanatic. He's a Brit, and spent 10 months and 15,000 miles
&gt;driving from northern Africa to South Africa (sometimes only 80-90 miles
&gt;a day, because of the roughness) in a '63 Kombi. He's got gobs of
&gt;stories to tell of his trip, pictures, advice, etc. He's driven
&gt;apparently everywhere in Europe and most places in Africa in the buss,
&gt;and would love to share his stories.
&gt;
&gt;If anyone thinks it would be worthwile, I'd be more than happy to put
&gt;some of these pix and stories in readable fashion, and put them on my HP
&gt;or somewhere available.
&gt;
&gt;If it's something anyone would care to hear about, let me know. I was
&gt;fascinated, and this guy has more hidden knowledge than most I've met.
