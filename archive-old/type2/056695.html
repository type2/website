Subject: re:Air dam/spoiler for camper

I've had a spoiler under Ashley for about 6 months and it does make a BIG
difference to stability in cross wind, he doesn't hop about anything like as
much and can be driven faster on motorways as a result. Don't know if it is
better than a lowered bus as I've no experiece with one.

Spoiler is made of fibregalss and needs drilling to bolt to bumper. Is about 1
inch lower than belly pan and makes this a bit awkward to refit if you take it
off - not impossible though. Spolier stand up well to knocks, I've scratched
mine but not craked it - yet. Colours are black or white. Mine is black &amp; I left
it this way as it doesn't show too much under the bus.

At 35UKP it was a good buy.
