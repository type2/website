Aw shucks :-)  I'm just sitting here hoping that David or one of the other
carb experts pulls my #&amp;** out of the fire gently if I went too far astray
on installing the dual carbs on a 2L engine...  I *think* it will work,
but I am not a guru on carbs!

&gt; I would add,
&gt; that you don't &quot;need&quot; to have the '79 fuel injection, especially if
&gt; you aren't dealing with smog. A complete, homogenous FI system from
&gt; any 75-79 bus will probably serve you better than carbs,

Very much agreed!  Actually, your odds of getting a '72 past smog with FI
installed go way up, even if that is a concern.

I would not install an early '75 with the funky AFM, but other than that
if you stick to all parts from a single year, you will be fine with any.
I suggested '79 to match the engine because that way he can walk into any
repair shop and say that the whole engine compartment can be treated as
per '79 spec, rather than saying it has '7x FI with a '79 block, etc.
Mechanics get (justifiably) nervous when systems from too many different
years are pasted together.

&gt; Am I wrong?

Nope :-)
