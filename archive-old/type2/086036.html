Subject: Re: [T2] Is my buss worth working on

Thanks a lot for your great answers.
To answer some of your questions:

1.How long have you had this bus?
Only 3 months, i got it from a friend of mine who had the buss many years.

2.How committed are you to getting it fixed?
Well, I am commited but I don´t know how much...

3.Is that actually a factory sliding roof sunroof that I can see in the 
first pic?
I don´t know but I can get a better picture of it if you like? How can I 
find out if it is a factory sliding roof?

4.my bus came from Lenartsfors originally ,I think ,where is that?
It´s up in the north of sweden(I think), it´s very dry and cold there so 
they have a lot of rust-free cars.

5.Have you tried to push a screwdriver through
the rust areas?
Yes, on some places I can push it through but not on the most importent 
places (I think).

I have the hole summer(maximum) to fix the car but I don´t have very much 
cash. I can borrow a MIG from a friend if I like but I have never used a 
MIG.
I really need a lot of tips about how to weld, where can I find 
information(exept type2)?
How hard is my buss to fix? Can I do it? I don´t have much experiense.
If you need more pictures of the bus I can get it(and smaller ones too), 
just tell me what to shoot on.

Thanks again for your answers, they are great.

&gt;Date: Thu, 21 Mar 2002 12:24:39 +0100
&gt;
&gt;Hello
&gt;
&gt;I have a vw buss from 1973.
&gt;If I look at the buss from the outside it looks ok. But when I crawl under
&gt;it I found a lot of rust, the problem is that I am not experiensed enugh to
&gt;judge how bad it actually is. That´s why I´m now asking for as much help as
&gt;i can.
&gt;
&gt;I have made a homepage with a lot of pictures on my buss, the adress is:
&gt;http://download.tripodnet.nu:81/Folkes_hemsida/index.htm
&gt;The page is in swedish but not the pictures:-)
&gt;
&gt;There are a few things becides the rust that I need to fix on the buss so I
&gt;want to know if the buss is worth working on, or if it´s better to start
&gt;looking for a new one.
&gt;I live in Stockholm, Sweden and rust is a big problem here.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks a lot for your help and I hope you understood my poor english.
&gt;
&gt;Regards Johan
