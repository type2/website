Subject: Roll backwards on a hill ??

&gt;     So, here's my question.  Do I drive an automatic, or a standard?
&gt; I'm scared to take my standard on any hills around here, because I don't
&gt; want to stall it and roll backwards into other cars.  That's like, my
&gt; worst fear.

So you find it difficult to drive away on a gradient? Well, I suppose with
the nose down you don't have a problem. Gravity will work in your favour.
However many people don't know how to drive away from a standstill when
going uphill. In Holland this is a standard procedure that everyone taking a
driving test has to demonstrate (and fears!).  It's easy and does NOT
involve using heel and toe! It does take a little bit of practise but really
is not rocket science.

What you do is as follows:
1 -	Put on the emergency brake (you MUST have a working e-brake though!)
2 -	Press the clutch-pedal all the way down with your left foot.
3 -	Put the car in first gear.
4 -	Rev the engine a little bit with your right foot.
5 -	Let the clutch come up until you feel the car wants to move,
	if necessary give it a little more gas.
6 - 	Use your right hand to ease off the e-brake gently,
	hold the car in position with the e-brake if needed.
7 -	Now at the same time let the clutch come up completely
	release the e-brake completely and give it a little more gas.

The whole procedure takes only a second or two to perform. The trick here is
to use the e-brake not the normal brake pedal. Whenever the cars wants to
roll back you can pull the e-brake to stop it immediately. Of course when
driving away look out for other traffic too!  All in all you need all your
hands and feet to do it right so lighting a cig, holding a beer or using
your cell-phone at the same time is a problem.

Try it on a quiet hilly road and have fun mastering the art of driving
stick.
