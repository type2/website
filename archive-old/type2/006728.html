Subject: Replacing Windows
Message-Id: &lt;1.5.4.16.19990512152520.39bff922_at_pop.mindspring_dot_com&gt;

  Removed all glass from my van, had it painted and now am
ready to replace windows.  Before I put them back in, would
like to ask if there are any tips etc other than what I see
in the archives.  I notice that people sometimes use silicone
sealer around them after getting them back in place.  It seems
to me that the perfect time to put a layer of silicone sealer
on the rubber would be just before pushing the windows back in
place.  Has anyone done/tried this?  Is there something wrong 
with doing it the way I am thinking.  I understand that, if done
perfectly, it probably should not require a sealer, but I notice
that people often seem to have to do it.  Looks like it would make
a better seal, and would be a little more insurance against the
dreaded leaks. Thanks.
