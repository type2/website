&gt; &lt;&lt;  You know a good place to look for tools is your local Pawn Shop. A

I've gotten a few things there, mixed reviews
&gt;
&gt; warning, only buy name tools, Snap-On, Craftsman, Mac, Proto, etc. The same
&gt; lifetime warranty applies to them, the tool company's don't know where you
&gt; bought the tool.
&gt;
&gt; But when you bring an old and broken Craftsman tool back, you
&gt; get a new ready-to-break Craftsman tool... ;-(

yeah but they don't tell you that it is the lifetime of the company, I
have some good Power kraft tools from Wards with a lifetime warranty.

unfortunately that was the Lifetime of Wards not the tool.....
