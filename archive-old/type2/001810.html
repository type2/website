Two new items I just wanted to clue you in on...

First, I received a small quantity of German made original-equipment ATE
master cylinders for '71-79 busses.  They are $69.95, down from $129.  This
is a below-cost blowout from one of my distributors. I only have 5 and will
get no more at this price, so it's first come first serve.

Secondly, I received a shipment of original-equipment LUK clutch kits for
'76 up Busses and Vanagons.  LUK is one of two original suppliers to VW (the
other being Sachs).  While the included throwout bearing is Brazilian, the
LUK clutch disk and pressure plate are original-equipment German made, as
opposed to the Sachs disks which are now Mexican.  These carry the VW logo,
indicating that they are indeed genuine VW.  The price is $149.95 for the
whole kit, which is only slightly more than the Sachs.  For those who want a
100% German setup, I can upgrade you to a German Sachs throwout bearing for
$14.95 more (please request it in the &quot;comments&quot; section of the order form
if you order via the website), although I frankly have not had any problems
with the Brazilian throwout bearings so I'm not sure how neccessary that is.
The reason for me bringing in these kits is the allegation (not neccessarily
true in my opinion, but oft-repeated nevertheless) that the quality of the
Sachs clutches has slipped (no pun intended) since disk production was moved
to Mexico.  This is the first time a German kit has been available since
Sachs moved production (not counting the $$$$ kit from the VW dealer, which
is probably also Luk).  Part number is 029 141 099.

On a similar note, I now have German made Beru distributor caps for '69-up
busses, aircooled Vanagons, and 009 distributors (Bosch equivalent 03010).
Beru is an original-equipment supplier to VW (no, Bosch is not the only one
:-), and is still made in Germany unlike the Bosch.  Not that this
neccessarily makes it better, but I do have a certain number of customers
who swear by them and prefer them to the non-German Bosch part. Part number
113 905 207C.  $6.49.  Also, if you order a tune up kit I will be including
this cap in the in place of the Bosch, while supply is available.

These items will be on the website tomorrow, or of course you can call or
e-mail.
