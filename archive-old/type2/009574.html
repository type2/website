&gt; While I've got the engine out of my 72 type2, I decided to install an
&gt; oil pressure sender so I can easily add the guage when I get more
&gt; money.  My problem is, with the type4 engine, the sender and the
&gt; distributer hit each other.  What is the best way to seperate the
&gt; two?  Thanks for any comments or suggestions.

I recently did this on my 77, I installed a 6in straight pipe (1/8
galvanized pipe) and a 'T' fitting. This allowed me to install the
gauge sender and the idiot light sender both. I wanted it this way so I
could veiw the gauge and also have the red light flash at me to make me
look at the gauge to make sure it was really low on pressure.
  I got the pipe and 'T' at the local hardware store.
