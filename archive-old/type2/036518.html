Dave and Darrin,

I have a Blaupunkt deck in my dash that fit with a little additional 
grinding, but many shaft-style stereos will fit right in.  

To overcome the noise of a bus, a power amp is a good idea.  I have a 100W 
amp mounted on the nose under the dash.  

For speakers, I used Radio Shack die-cast mini speakers.  The two in the 
front have 4&quot; woofers and fit right under the dash and above the parcel 
shelf.  These run off the power amp.  The two in the rear have 3&quot; woofers and 
mount on the shelf that goes across the back over the bed -- a perfect fit.  
The optional mounting brackets make it work.
