Subject: Charging circuit mods required for deep-cycle batteries?

Hi folks...

During my '76 Westy's maiden camping voyage (well, since I've owned it, 
anyway), my old, tired aux battery crapped out.  I suspect a failed 
charging circuit helped this failure along (I would have expected that 
the charge provided by running the engine would have been sufficient to 
power the fridge while keeping the battery at least partially charged, 
but alas, it was dead on arrival to our destination).

I'm considering replacing my old aux battery with a gel-type deep cycle 
RV battery.  My question is: Are the charging needs of these batteries 
significantly different such that I will have to modify the charging 
circuit?  I think the answer to that question is &quot;no&quot;, but I would like 
to gather opinions from those here who are using deep-cycle aux 
batteries.

I checked the library and archives, and while there was plenty of info 
and discussion about the charging circuit and battery design, I didn't 
actually find any mention of charging circuit mods to suit different 
battery types.

Thanks!
