Subject: KYB Shox.. too narrow

Hi Folks,
Installing the KYBs on a 78. Rear is fine and installed. The front KYB is
smaller (at the hosel..for a lack of a better term) narrower than the old
ones {top and bottom}.  I must need a spacer or something, the instructions
show one.
Are these readily available at a FLAPS or hdware store?

Am I missing something?

Beep Beep,
HapyBus
