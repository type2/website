Someone asked what to do befroe starting up a bus that had been sitting for
three months

My OPINION is do as little as possible at first. IFF the bus was running
before why start meddling
with a bunch of things and possibily break a working bus, and have to
diagnose a dead bus?
I'd suggest: Check that it has oil, and gas. Install, or maybe charge
battery (I'd just boost it).
&gt;From there I'd try to start it. 
If it starts then you can move on to a systematic inspection tour for
potential 
problems, but I'd still change one thing at a time and re-try it, so if you
break it, you know which action 
broke it. Also once it is started, then you can look at things like brakes,
lights .....
If it doesn't start, at least you know it isn't one of the  many things you
just messed with, and can
start a systematic diagnostic process. 

Just my opinion, but then I come from a don't mess with it unecessarily line
of mechanics.
