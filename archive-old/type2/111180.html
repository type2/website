&gt; While driving around the beautiful state of West Virginia, my accelator begins
&gt; to develop a mind of its own.  When I take my foot off the gas, the bus keeps

&gt; When I stop at a traffic light (which thankfully are rare in W.V.) the engine
&gt; is loud, though not deafening.
 
&gt; I just spent about an hour in the archives and library.  I found some good
&gt; info, but each case seems different, and I am a little overwhelmed where to
&gt; start.  My mechanical skills are pretty rudimentary.  Where should I start?
&gt; What to check first?

I would try first to isolate where the problem is. It will either be
in the accel pedal linkage, the cable or the actual throttle body
(where the cable attaches to in the engine). I would disconnect the
cable from the engine first. Have a helper push the pedal down while
you hold the other end of the cable. Try to tell if it is binding
somewhere. Might be a good idea to go ahead &amp; relpace it if
questionable about it. Also move the lever that the cable attached to
in the engine. Try to see if it moves freely or binds any. If you can
get it to stick while you are doing all this messing around then you
have found the problem &amp; can fix it. good luck.
