Bill Monk sends:

&gt; I have kind of a odd question. I have a limited garage height. I am going to
&gt; pull the motor our of my 78 Westy and need to know how much I am going to have
&gt; to jack the bus up to get the motor out. Anyone remember from the last time
&gt; they did it?

I got the engine out of my 72 by lowering it onto a quarter-sheet of plywood
with two holes drilled in the plywood and ropes threaded through the holes;
the ropes were the handles. No jacking required, though I think you'd have
to remove the intake system to do this--Edelstein didn't come with one.

I then got it onto a hand truck from work (we have the ultra strong kind)
and used that to bring the engine inside.

I wonder if a pallet jack would be low enough to get the engine back under
the Bus?
