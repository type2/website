Subject: mixing octane?
Message-ID: &lt;0.3d0f002d.253d677e_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I remember reading an octane comparison a few months back.  It stated that 
the rating the Germans use to grade gas is different from ours and that we 
are using a higher graded gas than the factories recommendation.  Now I'm a 
bug die hard and type 2 lover so I'm not sure if it only applied to older 
vehicles and if so what year was the cut off.  I guess I'm in need a 
refresher course to.  
Peace Out
