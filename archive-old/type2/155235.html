&gt; But you DO speak as a man who perhaps has experienced this firsthand?
&gt; What keeps 'em from swiveling around as you're trying to &quot;snap&quot; 'em in?

I have experienced this firsthand.  I don't remember a problem with
them swiveling around as I pushed the instrument cluster in.  I seem
to recall that a flat part of the clip slid on the opening in the
dash.  It's also been a few years since I've done this.  I'll have to
take a look tonight...
