has them organized by model year -- with the lengths varying accordingly
-- and the cable listed for the '71 model is almost the longest of the
bunch.

All my rigs seem to be non-stock and I've had your problem. Found, at one of 
the shows, a vendor with an alterable, &quot;universal&quot; length. Got 2, used both, 
but can't remember the brand (64 year old brain)..maybe some other showgoer 
has seen them?
