Subject: Opinions on vans for sale? 

I've found four Westys for sale:

There is a bus in town I am considering - it's kind of orange,
&gt; however. It's a Westfalia, 1980, but without the propane set-up, has an
&gt; icebox. Owned by a VW mechanic for years.
&gt;
&gt; I'm having a hard time getting over the orange and the lack of propane -
&gt; how easy would it be to paint it so that it looks good? It does have some
&gt; rust bubbleing under two windows.
&gt;
&gt; I guess a camp stove is the fix for the stove...
&gt;
&gt; I have the opp. to look at a 1986 which is $9,000. I guess it
&gt; it has the newer engine.
&gt;
&gt; ...and a 1985 for $7,000, with the &quot;straight-up&quot; poptop?

...and a 1981, orange, automatic, looks great, has no records. It's a
used car dealership....

&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Andree
