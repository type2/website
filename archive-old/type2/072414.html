Forgive me I'm a aircooled newbie, but willing to learn. Here's the story ~ 9 months ago I got a 1980 2.0l PO doesn't know which end of the screw driver goes in the slot, many, many little things broke, loose, leaking, missing. But he does have the records from the local VW mech, and he had them look at most of the broke, loose, leaking, and they charged him a lot of money ( funny thing, they are all still broke, loose, and leaking). Long story short, I've fixed all of the broke, loose, leaking, but it's the missing/changed I need some advice with. The exhaust system: 1st thing I notice the EGR adjuster arm thing (joins with the accelerator cable/throtle stuff), missing. No big deal, I get a new one $30, no tube thing through the tin to the exhaust? shrug? local VW mech (from the PO's records) had replaced/done something not clear to the exhaust system ~ 2 years ago.  I stop by (not with a lot of trust and convidence and their ability or workmanship or honesty) he tells me he !
often takes that out and welds over a patch helps 2.0l's pass emmision test.  Here come the questions: 1st does it really help it pass emission test? is he pull my leg ? isn't it illegal for a mech to alter the emission stuff? 2nd missing, my muffler gets a whole, no big deal, I order a new one from bus depot right year wrong muffler.  Seems my exhaust system has been replaced with something from a previous vintage, i.e. no cat converter. Flange on new muffle not same, new muffler really long. However, parts place wants BIG $$ restocking fee plus I have to pay for shipping, I cut the old flange off and weld it to new muffler blot it on, a little paint and viola. But, is this legal?  Am I toast next time I have to do emission test?  

Thanks for any help
