Subject: Re: [T2] Tow Bar -- shipping ideas?

&gt; Every now and then, someone posts on the subject of towing a Type II.  I'm
&gt; looking at a tow bar ~400 miles from here, wondering how to get it transported
&gt; at reasonable cost.  FedX is quoting $85 and the seller would need to make a
&gt; box for it.  Questions:
&gt;
&gt; (1) Does anyone have favorable experience shipping an object like this, via
&gt; FedX Ground, or maybe UPS, or other shipping services?

In addition to the one-word answer (Greyhound) there is a two-word answer
as well...  Parcel Post.  The USPS will accept and deliver the most
unusual things, up to and including live animals!  If you can get a label
on it, they will take it.

OOK!
