&gt; Engine builders, let me know.

6g is a lot of material to take off a piston.

The shop that I use for engine balancing removes the material from inside
the PIN. This takes a really hard cutter in the lathe, but it means much
less material removed owing to the density of steel versus AL. On some
pistons this is not possible, but ACVW piston pins are very thick so there
is lots of material there to play with.

Are you saying that you removed material from the skirt of the piston? Did
you take away any of the material that would have been in contact with the
cylinder wall? You can't disturb the piston skirt, that is what keeps the
piston running straight in the cylinder. Pistons are not cylindrical, they
are conical. The skirt of the piston is larger in diameter than the top and
this slight cone shape helps to keep the piston from cocking inside the
cylinder. If you cut material away from the skirt you will disturb this and
the piston is ruined.
