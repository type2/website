Why? 'Cause if it comes lose, it's a budgetbusterbigtime/money. 

Good point. I couldn't get my gland nut removed so I took it to a local VW
shop for removal. They used the same gland nut and re-torqued it with an air
wrench. Well, on my first test drive after engine installation I'm powering
up a big hill about a mile from home when crunch, grind, ahhhhhhhhh, the
most awful noise I've ever heard. I limp home. Actually I don't know how I
made it home because when I grudgingly removed the engine once again the
flywheel didn't come out with it. That's right, the gland nut had sheared
right off. Luckily, and I mean lucky, the damage was minimal, just a few
marks on the tranny bell-housing. The flywheel was fine, dowel-pin holes
o.k. Yes, the mechanic had been a little too forceful with his air wrench.
So, always torque this nut by hand. I only weigh about 150 lbs, so I had to
ask a husky friend for help.
