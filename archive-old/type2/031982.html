Subject: Any Cal Air-cooled Vanagon Tinware experts out there??

Hi all:

I have a VERY obscure question for the true air-cooled Vanagon expert....

I've assembled the two 2.0l Vanagon engines I'm rebuilding to the 
longblock stage, and I'm continuing to build one of them up to &quot;turnkey&quot; 
status.  (When I snatched the engine from the '81 California donor van I 
also took everything in the engine compartment.)

I THINK I'm missing a piece of cooling tin, one that, as I recall, goes 
between the right rear heating air duct and the cooling fan housing.  I 
have a vague recollection of this piece from the last time I disassembled 
/ reassembled my own '81 Cal Vanagon; it has an &quot;L&quot; shaped portion that 
attaches with a screw into the front (FIF) of the fan housing, requiring 
that you put the screw in blind, and using a stubby screwdriver because 
of the close quarters.  A real PITA.

I know I've looked for this piece in the various manuals own, and it 
doesn't show up in any of them.  Because of its position in the engine 
compartment I can't see it on the current engine in the van without quite 
a bit of disassembly, which I don't feel like doing.

Anybody recognize this bit I'm talking about?  Or am I smoking my socks?
