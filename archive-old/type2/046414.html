Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Stove Conversion to Coleman Cylinder

&gt; Problem is I can't find a regulator/adapter for the coleman cylinder. Anyone
&gt; know where I can get one? I've tried the local propane supply guys, no luck.

My 74 uses these canisters and has a regulator hooked up. I see no evidence of
it ever having a propane tank or plumbing.  I'd check an RV or camper supply
store.
