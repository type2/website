Well, I am going to try again.  Last time I was overwhelmed with 
responses and did not do a very good job of filing/handling them.
However, I did get rid of some of the parts and below is a list
of what I have left.  The parts are free (except for the manual)
and you only need to figure out a way to get them or send me the
money for shipping.  All of these parts are from a '73 VW Camper.
    1 automatic transmission (only know that the person told me 
      it was working when he removed it) I cannot ship this item.
    1 sterring column (w/o sterring wheel) with ignition sw. &amp; key.
    2 front brake calipers - 1 left &amp; 1 right
    1 external oil cooler with in-line oil filter
    1 bumper (couple of dents &amp; a little surface rust)
    1 Haynes 72 - 79 transporter manual that I want to trade for
        a xx - 71 transporter manual.  I'll mail you mine, if  
        you'll mail me yours.
As Mentioned above, these parts are free.  I sold my '73 and bought
a '71, so I don't need these '73 parts taking up space that could be
used for '71 parts.  E-mail me.
