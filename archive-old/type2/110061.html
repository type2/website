Subject: Re: [T2] BROKE DOWN:  starter wires  ???

&gt; My van will not start - the starter goes, but nothing else.

-Just to make sure we're communicating properly: you're saying that the
-starter spins, the engine turns over, but the engine won't start?

Correct.

-There are 2 &quot;spade&quot; connectors on the solenoid.  There's a stout &quot;free
-floating&quot; red and black wire to one and a blue wire (that goes into a
-harness bundle) on the other.  Then there are 3 wires that connect to a
bolt
-on the solenoid with a nut holding them in place.  I believe that second
-wire (blue, or maybe blue/brown?) actually connects to the combi relay;
-without that wire attached, the van certainly won't start.

is the &quot;stout &quot;free-floating&quot; red and black wire&quot; referring to the ignition
switch wire?

I will refer only to wires not on the bolt (those are fine):
The wire that heads from the relay to the starter comes out of a wire
housing sheath about 1 foot from the starter - the double wire that is not
attached to anything is also coming out of this sheath.  Should this
'double wire with 1 female spade fitting' also be attached to the soleniod?

Right now the starter turns, but no fuel pump and no power to the
injectors.

I will start with Bentley Saturday AM, but would like to be sure the
starter wires are attached properly 1st.

Thanks a lot,
Steve
