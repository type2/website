Subject: Re: [T2] Pain(t)/body

6 yr old acrylic enamel with hardner - was the store brand so not the 
good stuff...

Red and white.

Still doing well thought the red has faded a bit...

Has been outside for 99.2% of the time too.

Just thought you might want to know...

As it is a driver, I would use the same materials again. However I can 
appreciate the value of the better materials. I saw my '97 Accord in 
traffic the other day. Did a rear-ender repair on the car in 1996. Paint 
that I sprayed back then still looks perfect. Car had ~250K miles on it 
over a year ago when I saw it last and I was able to peek in the window. 
Got rid of it to get our Westy.
