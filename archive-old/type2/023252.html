Good thinking, but: We are not driving at 5000 RPM.  The cooling is 
improved at all RPM levels but top RPM maybe, in high performance 
engines top RPM is much higher than 5000 RPM and cooling is still 
sufficient, we may be able to benefit from this 'reserve in airflow' 
at lower RPMs. It is proven that the stock shrouding simply will not 
flow more air above a certain level, I forgot where the info came from, 
but do recall it was a thrustworthy source. The (crudely obtained) 
results I got proved enhanced cooling, resulting in a higher oil 
pressure while idling and my OP light not coming on like it used to, 
this with an OP switch that comes on at double the value that VW used 
originally.
