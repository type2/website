&gt; Alright All, I have a 71 westy that has had the 009 dizzy on it since I got

&gt; page.
&gt; So, I turn my engine to TDC and remove the 009.  Then when I install the 205Q,
&gt; the rotor does not line up with the notch on the lip of the dizzy, which
&gt; indicates where #1 should fire at TDC, it looks more like it is lined up where
&gt; the #2 will fire, yet the engine is DEFINITELY at #1 TDC (i took out the #1
&gt; spark plug and felt with a pencil to confirm TDC)  So, what the hell is goin
&gt; on here? Is it just as simple as changing the plug wires around to match the
&gt; dizzy TDC mark?

John,

A couple things may be going on here....

First, is your distributor drive gear installed correctly?  Pull the dist
out, rotate the engine to #1 TDC (verify this by watching the valve action
(trust *nothing*!)).  You have reached TDC for #1 180 degrees of clockwise
rotation after the intake valve closes, when the TDC notch lines up with
the case seam.  When the engine is turned to TDC for #1, the slot in the
distributor drive gear (look down the hole that the distributor came out
of) should  be perpendicular to the case seam and the slot should bve
offset toward the rear of the engine.  If it is not, then your distributor
drive is installed incorrectly.  This is unusual in T1s, but *very*
common in T4s, becuase the T4 dist drive should be installed at 12
clockwise rotation to a line parrallel to the case seam, but everyone does
*way* more T1 engines and &quot;all VWs are the same&quot;... TRULY annoying!

Second, It is very possible with the 009 that the plug wires are simply out of
place.  If your drive is correctly installed, then install the distributor
and rotate the case until the mark on the rim faces the slot in the shaft
(or the tip of the rotor, same thing).  Put the rotor and cap on.  If the
#1 wire is not over the tower over the mark, simply move the wires so it
is.

If your drive is not installed correctly, I highly recommend that you live
with it.  There is a 99% chance you can lift, rotate and reinstall the
drive to correct the problem without incident and a 1% chance that the
washers on the bottom of the drive gear will fall off.  If they do, you
need to split the case to retrieve them (unless you are *very* lucky).
The risk of dropping them is low, but the reward is microscopic.  I would
not do it.  Move the spark plug wires instead, but remember that you have
and use the rotor to determine #1 for valve adjustemnt purposes.
