&gt; On the other hand, the Click/Clack stumper one Saturday was howto start a
&gt; vw(carbed bug) with a low battery that is parked in a valley where you
&gt; can't push it.
&gt; 
&gt; No battery jumpers or new battery allowed.
&gt; 
&gt; Definitely had BTDT! and knew exactly how to do it.

&gt;    Well, if it was my ol' MGA, I could insert the crank
thru' the hole in the bumper and turn it over by hand...
(And yes, the MGA came from the Lucas Short Circus
with a factory crank... ;-)

What's the trick with the Beetle... ?-)
(Besides putting it in gear, lifting it with
one hand and spinning the wheel with the
other - The California Governor Approach... ;-)
