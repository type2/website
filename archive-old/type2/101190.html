Subject: Re:  replaced heads, loose pushrod  tubes

Dave:  Have  you ever wondered why Bentley gives both an upper and a 
lower limit on the length of those tubes? A mystery to me.

I've just finished installing a set. The length of mine exceeded the 
upper limit right out of the box.

The only reason I can think of is to make it easier to pull the heads 
up to the case.  For several of my head studs, I had to push on the 
head to get enough thread to start a nut.
