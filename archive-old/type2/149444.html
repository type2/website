Subject: Re: [T2] How many solenoids..

&gt;Barry,

&gt;I don't think there are any other solenoids, except perhaps the idle
&gt;jet cut off valve on the carb'ed models.

&gt;Cheers, dave


Gosh, you all are right !!  I am soooooo  embarrassed!!

Yesterday, Sunday, I took the '72 out for the second time since it was 
brought back to life.  A smooth running Westy, with dual Solex PDSIT 32's.  
At the six mile mark, I had to slow for a red light.  As I coasted up to the 
red light, I noticed that my tachometer on the '72 registered ZERO RPM..  I 
caught it in gear and it kicked over immediately, and stalled again.

So I coasted off  the road, caught it in gear again and kept the revs up 
because I KNEW what had happened.  I drove to a nearby park and . . .

Sure enough, the idle solenoid had flipped off its wire, and the idle 
solenoid had actually unscrewed itself somewhat.  I tightened the idle 
solenoid and put the wire back on.

No even 1 mile later the wire had popped off the idle solenoid again.  This 
time I used a pair of pliers to firm up the two female connectors on that 3&quot; 
piece of wire.  All is well again.
