The 2L never came with carbs in the US (you are in the US?). Your carbs may 
be set too lean.

vacuum leak?

Use a strobe and dwell meter to double check everything.

Anyone else?

&gt;I've got a 2L in a 75 westy and I've set the timing statically according

&gt;with it ? It doesen't sem to run hot.The points are set a little bit snug
&gt;on .016.When I time it by ear it ends up around 12* BTDC although it
&gt;should be at 7.5. I,ve sort of compromised I guess I'm around 9 now.Should
