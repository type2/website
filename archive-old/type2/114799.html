Subject: RE: [T2] Mexico VWs?

What &quot;sage&quot; advice!

You can get the Mexican insurance after you insure your vehicle through your
normal agent and most likely they can give the Mexican insurance as well.





Get some insurance for the VIN, both collectors insurance, and somehow, some

Mexico insurance (this last part I have no idea on how to do it)
