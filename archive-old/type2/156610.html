Subject: Steering Wheel

Hey guys,

      My steering wheel in my 73 Bus was damaged when I got the car. I'd really rather not put back a damaged steering wheel. Does anyone know where I might be able to find a brand new steering wheel for our generation of Busses? And also, are there any aftermarket horn buttons? I'm not looking for anything tacky, but something that's perhaps period correct. The regular black knob is somewhat boring... if there was a button that perhaps had the Wolfsburg emblem or something like that, I would prefer that.


Thanks!!!

Todd
