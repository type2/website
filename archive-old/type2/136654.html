Subject: Re: [T2] Re: ListServs and Pix

I am willing to setup and host pics.type2_dot_com (or whatever) using
either gallery or forum software. I work for a university and my
bandwidth usage is less encumbered. It would provide a moderately safe
spot to store photos of projects, and with linking from type2_dot_com
proper, should be covered by archive_dot_org's snapshots.

I use a text email reader but would love longer term access to project
photos, descriptions, etc.

I think thesamba_dot_com has already filled this vaccuum, but I don't know
for certain.

&gt; My interest is in when I look back at the archives and want to see the pics somebody is talking about 2 years ago, often the pics are not available because the freebie sites have changed, deleted pics, or a person's own domain no longer exists. Of course I archive my own messages for the day when the Type2 list might not be here and I download pics whenever I can but if the pics were there in-line with the message from the get-go then viola I've got good info there.
