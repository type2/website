&gt; I'm going over my bus engine and discovered that at lease 2 case sealing

&gt; One of the studs is right behind the crankcase pulley and the other is
&gt; lowest one in back near the bottom of the flywheel.
&gt;
&gt; Can these be fixed with threaded inserts or is a new case in order?

If there is enough metal around the stud, you can use an insert.  The
insert should be stronger than the original thread.
