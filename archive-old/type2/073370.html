Shelby,
	Definitely a C. My '78 Transporter is a daily driver, kid-hauler,
all around vehicle.  The usual rust spots under the windows and doors ( bad
re-paint job before I bought it)  but it's structurally solid, mechanically
solid and reliable. That's all I'm asking. Will I ever try to &quot;restore&quot; it.
Probably not. I've restored a '67 Bug, but spent a bundle on bodywork ,
which I don't do, so unless I inherit a fortune the old
&quot;Butterscotch Bus&quot; will have to be content with being cosmetically challenged.
