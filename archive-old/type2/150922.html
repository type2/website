Subject: RE: [T2] Since the trip to Cali is off...

Don, take my advice, drive the extra hour and go to Laramie instead. Think 
of stopping by the Vedavu on the way (great place to camp as well as visit 
and play on the rocks). Laramie is a small college town with a lot more to 
do with the Snowy Range (Medicine Bow National Forest) only another hour to 
the west. Coal Creek Coffee Shop has great music. The Library is an awesome 
restraunt microbrewery.

But if you do decide on Cheyenne... They have a cool museum near the Capitol 
Building. The Capitol building is cool. They havae some great artwork there. 
Seirra trading Post is in Cheyenne if you wanna shop. 
http://www.sierratradingpost_dot_com/Default.asp?wc=true On I-25 is a rest area 
where a party of Blackfoot Indians werre massacred by Arapahoe and Cheyenne 
(or maybe Pawnees I can't remember) I think it's exit 292 or 293.

There's also a haunted church bell tower in Cheyenne, but the name escapes 
me right now....
