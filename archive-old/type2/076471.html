&gt; &gt;&gt; I suspect that VW was doing the same things and went to stainless
&gt; &gt;&gt; pipes to get reasonable life.

&gt; &gt; Just cause I want to beat this dead horse really good - why still use
&gt; &gt; regualr steel for the flanges?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cost?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Brittle-ness (I've heard stainless is more brittle)?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My bet is on cost....
&gt; 
&gt; My bet is on the brittleness of the steel, and its effect on the forming of
&gt; the flanges. They'd probably have to retool to make flanges out of
&gt; stainless, so it was cheaper and as effective just to use carbon steel for
&gt; the flanges.
