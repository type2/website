Subject: mounting bolts, nuts, etc

hi all,
I am looking for a source for the hardware that is needed to mount the seats
in my transporter.  I have the back seats, but bolts for only the rearmost
seat.  I am now trying to mount the middle seat (two seater with arm rest),
but have none of the hardware.  Trips to the junk yard and local hardware
stores have not produced anything worthwhile.  I did find that I  might be
able to use some carriage bolts and some electrical conduit brackets, but
just don't trust this to keep the seat in the vehicle on any sort of sudden
stop.  Does anyone know where I can get the real McCoy?
