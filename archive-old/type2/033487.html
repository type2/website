&gt; I thought exhaust(carbon monoxide) was odorless and
&gt; colorless? How do you 
&gt; know it's entering inside?

Try to go to your local airport and see if they have a
pilot shop (yellow pages)and purchase a carbon
monoxide detector. I think is $3 or $5 or so. Is a
2&quot;x2&quot; card that is place in the dash board with double
side tape(included) The center is a soft round circle
that when the color change will indicate the gas
presence. If you don't find it I can give you a web
site that you can get it at Sporty's Pilot Shop. I
don't have the web site on hand at the moment but I
can posted this after noon. This is a grate tool for
all of you that worry about carbon monoxide leaks. You
can put 2 if desired. One in the back and one in the
front. This product have a time life (you have to
replaced after so many months) But is as reliable as
it gets. Used in most general aviation airplanes. Most
of them are air cool and the heaters are set up like
VW's or they have a gas heaters just like VW's. Hope
this help!
