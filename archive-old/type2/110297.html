Subject: re: front door screens

I made up a few sets for some list members about three 3 years ago.  
Mine were still working great after four years.   Hopefully they held 
up well for others as well.  Search archives under magnetic screens.   
Some others have made them for themselves also. Not much too it, just 
time consuming.  I'll be glad to share any further info if you're 
interested
