&gt; My Haynes says I have to remove the 090 auto tranny and engine as a unit in
&gt; my 79 Westy. It seems to contradict itself, as the supplement at the back of
&gt; the book says the 090 has to come out together with engine, yet earlier in
&gt; the book it says if you're concerned about weight, remove the engine first.
&gt; Has anyone got any experience with this?

I have a 78 with an auto tranny and have done it both  ways. I find it
easier personally to take em out seperately.  You don't have to pull em
apart much, just watch the inner tranny shaft it wants to stay in the
engine side.  slide it clear before dropping, easy to bend, and it drives
the tranny fluid pump, critical unit
