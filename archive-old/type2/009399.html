Hi all,
   I'm looking for help with an electrical problem on our 71 westy.
When we use the turn signals, left or right, the exterior lights work 
properly but both lights on the dash blink.  Things appear to be wired 
correctly.  Is this normal for this year?  Any and all suggestions welcome 
as I'm tired of laying on my back and tracing wires under the dash.
