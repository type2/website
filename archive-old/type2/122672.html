Subject: Re: [T2] friday topic   Where is the hubcap?

Hi Bob,

On December 16th, it was reported to be in the hands of Buskatier Mike 
Hancock. He posted the following pics to the Buskatier list:

Word from Mike is that it will be appearing at Havasu... It's been 
making its own way from bus to bus undirected for a couple years now. 
I'd love to see the entries in the logbook, it was a fun read back in 
2000 when I had it.

Happy trails,
