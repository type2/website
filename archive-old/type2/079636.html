Subject: Re:? on my 71 Westy

Hi Chris,
   You asked ;
              &quot;It also has two cover of sheet metal that run the outboard 
sides of the middle of the bus center is not cover. This is something I have 
not seen before, any feedback on this one.&quot;

   My 71 westy is also like that.  Sheetmetal outboard of each frame rail 
and the space between them is open.
