Subject: steering box adjustment

&gt;&gt;&gt;The steering box was changed from a worm and peg design to a worm and
roller design in August 1973  The new design, while more durable,
isn't adjustable.&lt;&lt;&lt;

Are you sure??  I've adjusted the play out of steering boxes on both a '79
and '74 within the past year.  Screw/locknut design was on both of them.
I'm certainly no expert on model year/design changes, but it took the play
out of the wheel on both.  I can't remember for sure, but I think the
adjustment screw and locknut were located on the driver's side of the
steering box.
