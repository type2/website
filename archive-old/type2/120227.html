Just want to make one quick note which people have danced around and
some even said. the stock system is designed to give a battery a small
amount of charge. this tends to prolong the life of batteries. the
stock system does not provide a good way for a lot of power to make
it's way from the alternator/generator to the accessories, except for
keeping a battery well charged while driving. pros/cons of each way.
as as long as it's on the road enjoy it :)
