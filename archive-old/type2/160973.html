&gt;If ignition is retarded, temperatures go up.  However, if the

Our engines are designed to run on 87 but it seems that running an aircooled engine at sea level and climbing the hills at altitude cause it to run at vastly different termperatures compared to a modern watercooled engine.

How this temperature increase compares to the pressure increase from increased compression that requires higher octane would be interesting to discover.
