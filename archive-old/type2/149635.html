Subject: Re: [T2] hot air tube under the bus

I used double walled metal tubing, and sprayed insulating foam between the 
walls. Use the low expansion foam though, the high expansion stuff can 
distort the shape of the pipe! Made a BIG difference in temp of the air 
coming out the vents.

&gt; I would use double wall metal tubing, like for a house
&gt; water heater going up thru the roof.
