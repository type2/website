&gt; I will traveling to Dallas from Annapolis, MD, weekend (26,27th) for a quick

???????? a 2500 mile &quot;quick trip&quot; in a bus,  isn't this an oxymoron???

&gt; engine and tranny and shoot back for Maryland. I'm leaving Friday, AM, and 
&gt; hope to be home Monday. 

hope you have some leave time, and two drivers.  made that trip some years
ago when I was younger and had a lot less sense.  At least a full 30 hours
each way in a van.  hope for your sake I'm wrong. 

  I assume your taking I-40, between Roanoke and Knoxville there are some
pretty steep grades that will knock your 71 westy down to 40mph or so for
a couple hours.  it's a beautiful trip it's a shame to have to be so
pushed for time.
