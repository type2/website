Subject: Re: List Administration Changes THANKS STEVE
Message-Id: &lt;199910020130.SAA20051_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

&gt;I am no longer the Administrator of the list.  The post is hereby vacated.
&gt;I *am* one of the co-administrators, along with George, Ken, and Sean.  

I want to be the first to acknowledge the service Steve has done
for this list in the last, hell who knows how long it's been.  A lot of people
don't know Steve except for the occasional public grouching but you ALL
need to realize this man has given of HIS time, HIS money, HIS effort in some
hard times, way beyond the call of duty.  Not to slight the original, Gerry
was a saint, and Ken as well who took us through a real tough transition and
has built the www into a very nice site (with others.)  But Steve was doing the
behind the scenes long before people realized.

For those of you with negative impressions of the man, I'll tell you, never a
more giving person I've met I think.  I rag on Steve hard at times as he is the
only Catholic I know who converted to Judaism, in reality I do this as he is
possibly the most &quot;Christian&quot; person I know.

 A quick example:

Over a year back I had volunteered to help a friend in DC by changing the
heads on her wasserboxer '90 Vanagon, I had a weekend to do it in she needed
the work done immediately, and didn't have the money to do it with.  Well and good,
now I KNEW there was no way I could do it myself in the time I had, and
she was in a real pinch, Steve volunteered to help without thinking a second
about the fact that at that moment neither of his Buses ran, he was walking
or borrowing a brothers car which he had to surrender during the coming week.
So here Steve blows the entire weekend with me helping her while he should
of been solving his own problems, all the while as normal while he was
running the list, a big daily chore in itself.  I think he ended up having to pay
to have work done on one of his Buses we could probably have been doing
instead.

This is par for the course, that is the kind of man he is.  A side that
many of you who have never met him or who only see him when he
tries to keep an unruly mob of 750+ in line and on topic never notice.  This
past summer I was going to try to help, circumstances of my immediate future
prevented me but I got an intimate feel for what was involved for one person
to keep this thing going, how about a couple of hours a night on a bad day?
Maybe every day for a week, how many out there volunteer that kind of time
to ANYTHING without getting a thing in return except for occasional harassment.
Who ever really thinks about what goes on to keep this thing spam free, trouble
free, and really only slightly moderated within bounds of normal society.

Anyway perhaps most of all I'll simply say I am proud to consider Steve
a friend, good friends you can count on are hard to find.  Any Bus owner
who broke down in the DC area could count on Steve's help in a second,
there are not many like him.  The man seldom if ever says things for himself
and will probably be annoyed I've taken valuable list resources to say these.
I ask everyone who cares to drop him a pmail over the next few weeks (don't
gang up) and just say Thanks, I'll buy you a beer when I get to meet you.
(this one is really going to tick him off if he gets 100's of emails but do it
anyway, just maybe a THANKS in a subject line and send it)

On a total small aside, a few people might still recall that I used to offer
some fair advice myself from time to time on this list, I've followed it since
the second year it was vanagon, from the good ole days of about 140
people or so.  I've made a lot of friends, I've seen a lot of them come and
go.  I've probably pissed off many people but I'd like to think I've helped a few.
Unfortunately it is obvious that with med school unlike working as an engineer
my time has become way too scarce of late, and I hardly think some of my
recent contributions on some bad days have been very valuable.
I want to publicly thank everyone who has helped me, apologize to anyone
I've offended intentionally or unintentionally, and note that I can still be
reached by pmail at my new address in the sig.  It has been fun.

Everyone who cares, remember to give Steve a hand for a job incredibly well
done, and one after all which he will keep doing to an extent.  And thanks
to George and Sean, and of course Ken, all fine guys who are going to keep
things running smoothly for a long time.
