Subject: Sunroof drainage?

I saw a post a while ago from a guy who went by the name Yug (seriously) 
talking about clearing out drainage holes on the corners of the sunroof. I 
tried emailing him and couldn't get through. Do these holes exist? I can't 
seem to find them on my 64 deluxe but could REALLY use them if they're there.

Could someone tell me if they're on my bus and if so where to look.

Thanks,
