Subject: Pondering Skylights for a '72 Westy

Was just sitting here and had the old gin mill running and was wondering if 
anyone has ever put skylights in a 68 - 72 pop-top. It seems like it would be 
straightforward except for the &quot;ribs&quot; in the fiberglass top. Has anyone ever 
tried this? I saw my first Dormie with skylights in it a few weeks ago and 
liked them a **lot**  Not to mention the show on PBS I watched the other 
night with a shot of Ken Kasey in Further the bus with the bubble in the 
top....  I looked in the library and the archives, but didn't find anything...
