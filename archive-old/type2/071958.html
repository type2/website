Thermostat.

&gt;Close by is what I assume is the fuel pump. There is a small tube

Mine has a short piece of hose attached that goes nowhere.  I'm told it's a
drain pipe - in any case you needn't worry about that one.

&gt;Evidently these things aren't critical to the operation of the engine,

You might have just started another holy war with that statement.  :)  You
might consider installing a thermostat so your engine will warm up more
quickly.
