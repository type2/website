&gt; Would we have a lot of trouble with gas at low altitudes with the higher
&gt;  CR? I know the magic number used to be 9:1 or was it 9.5:1. But all the
&gt;  changes in gas over the years, I don't know what a safe CR is anymore.

Before anybody goes and builds an engine with 8:1 compression they should 
read what Gene Berg has to say about compression ratios.  You can call 
714-998-7500 to get a catalog and the info is in there.
I contacted Jake (the guy who originally suggested 8:1 CR's) off line and 
asked a few specific questions about his recommendation.  I didn't expect him 
to spend lots of time replying and I deleted the post so I can't quote him.  
However, I did get some impressions that I think are worthwhile to pass on to 
the list.
I asked him what kind of engine life to expect with 8:1 compression.  
Specifically I asked if he's gotten 100,000 miles or more on such an engine.  
He didn't answer that question.  
What he did say was that after much trial and error he has a formula where, 
by adjusting valve sizes and cam grinds he's able to make 8:1 work.  He 
wasn't willing to share any of that info, however.
Anyway, I think that there is a whole lot more to this than just raising the 
compression ratio and driving your bus as usual.  I'd hate to see somebody do 
this and go out and burn a hole in a piston because of running a CR that is 
too high.
