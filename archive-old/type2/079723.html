Subject: Re: [T2] Engine replacement (long)

&gt;Boston Bob ... doesn't give a warranty for an
engine with the weber carb on it. ...At the least I
would need new dual carbs for a warranty.

He won't warrant an engine with a weber progressive or
any weber?  Will warrant Dellortos?  New dual carbs
means stock or any dual carbs?  I thought all
aftermarket carbs were jetted wrong for VW
applications and need to be properly jetted.  Is the
progressive completely incapable of being jetted
properly?
