Subject: clutch weirdness

Had a strange problem on a recent trip:

After about 30 miles of highway driving, I stopped at a stoplight and heard
a high pitched whining noise. Thinking the bearing in the generator was
going bad, I left the engine running and hopped out for a look.

Once I got back there, no noise. Weird. So I get back in, shove in the
clutch and guess what...whining noise!

&quot;Ah ha!&quot; I sez to my wife and child, &quot;It's the throwout bearing.&quot;

But here's where things get strange.

The throwout bearing, clutch and pressure plate are brand new. And the
problem only happens when the bus has been working hard, like on the
highway. If I push in the clutch after the bus has been working hard and
try and start the engine, the starter drags, almost as if the throwout
bearing is hanging it up. If I put it in neutral and start it under the
same circumstances, no problems.

My guess is the clutch actuating mechanism is somehow going awry, and
changes in the engine/transmission relationship when the bus is hot somehow
exacerbate the problem. Any other ideas?
