Subject: Towing T2 on a Dolly - Damage Tranny?

Hi gang,

I'm going to pick up a '78 Bus for its tranny and other various parts
with a tow dolly.  Is it okay to tow it on a dolly with the rear wheels
on the ground and the tranny in neutral, or will this cause any damage?


Thanks in advance,

-Ross
