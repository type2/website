Subject: Re: [T2] Broken into again. (fed up)

Removable stereos are great. We used them in Italy where thefts were 
rampant. However that said - we still had some exploratory break-ins to see 
if the stereo was stored under the seat.

I prefer something a bit weird.

Buy a removable face stereo. Install vintage AM radio (that works would be 
cool) in the dash.

Install new stereo in dash. Install remotely the removable face between the 
sunvisors with a long data cable connecting the face to the stereo. It may 
require relocating some of the stereo face latching hardware to the ceiling.

Remove and carry with you the face.

Create a small wooden panel that contains fake clock and compass (2&quot; round) 
to cover face mount.

How's that for Rube Goldberg?
