Subject: [T2] cold hard tranny

We just had our first cold week here in Northern California (dipped into the mid 30's).  Anyway, the first day there was frost on my windshield is also the first day I had
trouble with my (new to me) used transmission.  I can't get the Beast into 1st or 2nd when it's cold.  The previous two months of driving on this (new to me) tranny were
just fine, but now I can't gently coax or forcibly push the shifter into 1st or 2nd.  And I can only get it into 1st or 2nd about 80% of the time when the tranny is warm.
I replaced the tranny oil with 85/90 GL4 but that didn't make a difference.

Does anybody have any ideas as to what the problem could be?
Does anybody have the address of a rebuilder near Northern California?

Thanks,

Dan Evans
