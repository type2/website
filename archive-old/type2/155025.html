Subject: Pedal problem

Tom recently resolved his clutch pedal problem by cleaning up and
lubricating the pedal pivot shaft.  That reminds me of a problem I had a
couple of years ago.  On a round about, back roads, drive home from Buses By
The Mill I caught a smell of hot brakes.  I pulled over and found the front
brakes to be warm, not too bad but definitely not right.  A short while
later I realized that when I took my foot off the brake pedal that it wasn't
coming quite all the way back up.  So for the rest of the trip home after
releasing the pedal I'd put my toe under it and pull it the rest of the way
up.

The next day I took the pedal assembly apart and found that the 30 year old
grease had dried out and solidified causing the problem.  A good cleaning
and lubrication fixed the problem for me too.  I guess the moral of the
story is to not over look the simple things when there's a problem.
