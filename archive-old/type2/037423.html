Subject: Re: 1970 cooler/sink unit

Hi Friends,

    I'm new to this list, and I am in the process of finishing up the 
restoration of a 1970 1/2 Westfalia type 2. I need a sink unit,stand-up 
cooler for it that is within reasonable shipping distance from Jamaica Plain, 
Massachusetts. I also would like to hear of any good mechanics in the area 
who can do the nitty gritty work on the bus. Many of the good local shops are 
now gone.

Thanks, Ned
Jamaica Plain, MA
