You do it with a metal coil you slip over the brake line, they come in
different sizes, so the coil inside diameter is just a little bigger than
the outside diameter of the brake line.  You guestimate where the bend
should be, slip the coil over the line and GENTLY AND SLOWLY bend the brake
line over.  The coil keeps the brake line from folding.    Then you slide
the coil off.  It does take a little practice, and I recommend you buy an
extra line (they don't cost that much) and practice.  After a while it's
easy and very satisfying.

&gt;I posted an earlier message about brake line difficulties I was having.
&gt;Anyone successfully bent his/her own brake line.  All the brake lines you
&gt;buy come straight.
&gt;
&gt;Do machine shops do this, or FLAPS?
