&gt; hey volks, I was on vacation, so if you guys already ran a thread on this

&gt; but I got a letter today from VWoA,  really nice VW letterhead and envelope.
&gt;
&gt; it was a promotion for the Michigan VW Club annual event which VWoA is
&gt; getting involved with.
&gt;
&gt; IT IS GREAT TO SEE THAT THEY ARE NOW WANTING TO SUPPORT US AND NOT SUE US.

VW has never failed to use the aircooled community to promote its current
products

It remains to be seen whether they will call off the lawyers or not.
