Subject: Re: [T2] Windshields-to-go

Go to:

http://www.windshieldstogo_dot_com/index.html

and fill out the quote form.  They'll get back to you in a couple of days with the price.  When I called their 800 number, I was quoted a higher price, so I tried the website just for reference, and when that quote was cheaper, I used it when I called to order my windshield.  As far as the $123 charge goes, it could include shipping, which I was quoted as being in the $45 range.  I actually drove to a near-by warehouse and picked up my windshield in person.

&gt;Someone recently posted that that got their 71 bus windshield from
&gt;windshieldstogo_dot_com for 80 bucks.
&gt;
&gt;They just quoted me $123.00 for the glass ($218 installed). How does one go
&gt;about getting the $80 price?
