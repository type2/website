Subject: Re: [T2] Re: w/s washer electric pump retrofit

Paul
I can't imagine me being wrong,,, LOL
So,,, I built the circuit, and tried it out in my 74 Vw..
works fine,, no horn blowing,, squiters worked great....

The outer tube of the steering column  is NOT at +12vdc...

It is just the ground path for the horn,, which can also be used for this
relay circuit.




Jamie Rivers said..........

&quot;Another thing you can do,, instead of a micro switch on the stalk,
you can supply power to a small relay coil,, take the other side of
the coil to a home made contact on the stalk,, a small gob of epoxy
holding a tiny wire soldered to a thumb tack kinda idea..... when you
pull on the stalk, it grounds to the column,, and energizes the
squirter pump&quot;..


Paul A  replied..........
Wooooo, wait a second there.  That outer tube of the steering column
is carrying 12 volts DC for the horn circuit so don't expect to use it
for a ground.  Not unless you want your horn to sound every time you
squirt your windshield...lol
