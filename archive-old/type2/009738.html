Chris:

American car manufacturers have been known to go way overboard on cheesy
accessories in the past.  Just look at any '50's era Cadillac with it's
giant tailfins and tons of chrome.

Here in the U.S. we have a vast array of terrain to travel over.  High
mountains and low deserts.  Many of us like to play it safe and have some
gauges in our VWs to warn us if something is going wrong with our engines
before disaster strikes.

Thank you!

 Bus Boys,
 
 I contend that gauges make me less aware of my engine's health. To think
the 
 opposite is an American
 phenomena, and it also the position that usually promotes Air
conditioning, 
 radios, electronic ignitions and
 other creature comforts that have been known to sell alot of american
cars. 
 it's the american way.
 
 Therefore, I am against guages because they will make **ME**  lazy and out
of 
 touch.  Not for everyone, but 
 definitely for me.
