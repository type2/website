Thanks, so true. In fact it felt like nothing in the cab.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; But I have to ask...
&gt;
&gt; Did you run into a &quot;bank&quot; as in &quot;bank building&quot;, or into a &quot;bank&quot; as in
&gt; &quot;really big pile of dirt&quot;?

Actually a birm on the side of the road. It just rode up a little, than I
gained control immediatly.  I guess it shook up the back. The fuel sender is
not working, rear tire flat, the shift linkage off, and I havd scrapes down the
side.
