Subject: Re: [T2] alternator tip &amp; question

I'll consider thinning my 40w with Marvel (isn't it
sweet smelling diesel?) and thickening my fuel with it
when it gets seriously chilly here and hard to crank.
In 1,500 to 2,000 miles, when I change the oil, I'll
ponder what comes out and go to multigrade Rototella
for the cold season.

The Marvel claims always remind me of when they ask
the 100 year-old guy his secret to longevity. &quot;Fifth
of Jack Daniels and a cigar every day!&quot;

But who knows? Maybe it keeps the tank from rusting,
if nothing else.

 I used Marvel mix in my gas on
&gt; long trips for years. 
&gt; Improved gas mileage by 2. Does it (its parrafin
&gt; people) ruin an engine? I 
&gt; dont know, its still running after 20 years.
