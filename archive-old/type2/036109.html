Subject: What Distributor Do I have??

I am still in the process of tuning the 1600DP engine in my
'71 camper van .  I know that the type of distributor has an impact
on how the ignition timing should be set, so I am trying to 
determine what distributor I have.  Bently says the '71 should have
combination vacuum and centrifugal advance and vacuum retard.
The distributor I have is a 231 177 036.  It has only one vacuum
line going to it from the carb (vacuum advance).  I cannot find this
distributor number in Bently or any of the other manuals I have.
Does anyone know anything about this distributor??  Thanks.
