Subject: Re: [T2] Starter

my 78 bus with a  2..0  used a weird starter, I believe it was self 
supporting, but when it died I put a stock self supporting starter in it, 
this did not work as the teeth on the starter did not go in far enough to 
engage the ring gear.

I had  to hunt for a 2.0 starter 

this starter is made for the later transmission case. 
it will turn a stock 1600cc motor as that was the motor we put in it to get 
back on the road.
the gear on the 2.0 starter does not look like the gear on the earlier  one, 

I am sure someone out there has a Bosch book which  will tell you the model 
number of this starter.......
