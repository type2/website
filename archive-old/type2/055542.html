&gt; &quot;Honey-dues,&quot; and a curiously rattling shroud fan impeller cut the travels
&gt; short. Take your umbrellas folks!

I will give a report on Sunday afternoon of how the show was.  If it isn't
raining, I might even drive my 67 over.

I, too, have honey dues to tend to, but on Saturday so I won't see the toys. .
