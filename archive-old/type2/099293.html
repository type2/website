&gt;The camper I got back in 71 was a European model that had the full bed under the poptop and the spare tire in front.  The rear tire well came with a &quot;pro&quot; looking fiberboard insert with metal side clips, and a wedge shaped cushion covered with the yellow vinyl.  You could make your own from foam.

 
&gt; Does anyone have or sell or know where I can get a nice corner cushion that
&gt; fits exactly into the spare tire hole and comes right up and lines up with
&gt; the mattress for my 70 bus with the mustard coloured Westy fabric?
