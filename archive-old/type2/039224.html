Subject: Rod knock??

Today,

I went to the garage and opened the door, 
started the bus and where there was none before,
there was a rap tap tapping, 
knocking at my cylinder four.

My wife came out then,
as I lay on the floor,
&quot;Will we be camping&quot;, she said.
And I replied, &quot;Nevermore&quot;

For there seems to be in this old type 4
a problem that wasn't there before.
There is a rap  tap tapping, 
a knocking on cylinder four.

Seriously,  this thing  has developed what sounds like a rod knock.
I bought this bus last October and I've put about 1500 easy miles on it since.
By all appearances (and service records) this bus appears to have been well 
maintained and was always adult owned.  
I started it the other day to get the porch furniture out of the double cab 
storage platform, and it sounded like a lifter wasn't pumped up.
Today I needed to get my Willys out and I let it run longer, to see if it 
would pump up.  Nope.
Going to the back I heard a rapping on the right side of the engine.  Man, 
this does not sound good.  I pulled the valve cover hoping for a pushrod out 
of the rocker, or a loose rocker arm, anything.  It all appears tight, 
pushrods are all in place.
The engine has 79,100 miles (original) and has good oil pressure.  I have VDO 
gauges and it runs right where it should temperature wise.  When I parked it 
in the garage last week it was not making the noise.
Can someone out there suggest something that I could be overlooking before I 
declare it DOA?  
The money isn't there for a rebuild now and I hate to not even get one time 
camping out of it.
I know what it is in my heart, I just need some suggestions to fiddle with as 
my mind accepts the truth.
(It's an auto tranny, by the way.  Was kind of hoping for converter noise, 
but I don't think that's it.)
Thanks,
Greg Burke
