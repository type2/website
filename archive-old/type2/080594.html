I always shopped at Vee Parts before there were any online vendors.  I 
found them to have a great selection and great prices.  They have stuff in 
stock that other VW vendors dream about at night.  Things like Solex carb 
and air correction jets, locking engine hatch mechanisms, 32/34 Solex carb 
rebuild kits and dipstick bellows for the type IV.  I also used to get type 
IV thermostats there.  They have two stores - one in National City and one 
in El Cajon.  The one in National City is larger.  Bottom line - they are a 
good parts source and IMO shouldn't be overlooked, especially if you are 
close enough to go there in person.

&gt;Vee Parts is located here in San Diego.  I've made only about a half dozen

&gt;store purchases, I recall them being fairly well stocked and pretty 
&gt;knowledgeable.  I don't recall
&gt;  them being too expensive but, as always, BusDepot has better prices, at 
&gt; least better than Vee's
&gt;in-store prices.
