Subject: Re: [T2] Transmission filling hole bolt

Try getting a Dremyl tool with a cutting disk and creating little slots
all around the inside edge of the hole in the plug.  You can also drill
very short holes all around.  Cut a 1/2&quot; bolt short so the cut part fits
within the hole and lets the hex head stick out. Creat flats on the 1/2&quot;
threaded part using a grinding stone.  Use JB weld (the 5 minute stuff
to glue the bolt within the hole.  If it wants to run out, put tape over
it to hold it there until set.  Since this has to resist torque, the
holes and the flats are to keep it from spinning in the hole and
gripping well. Use an ordinary socket to twist the plug out!  MB  78

&gt; Hope this makes sense.  I went to change the transmission oil on my bus and
&gt; noticed that the filling hole bolt was stripped(the head of the bolt where
&gt; the allen key goes).
