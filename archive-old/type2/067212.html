Yup -
That's me, in that category!

&gt; It's interesting to me that so many folks on this list are 30-40-ish. It
&gt; gives me faith that so many Volks drivers don't give up when they get a bit
&gt; older, 

It's not the age, it's the gettin' married part, that slows down the 
mechanic'n. Other *activities* take precedent!

But then again, she musta had an idea of what she was up against, as 
I had 5 air cooled's when we met (2 busses, 1 sqbk, 1 bug, 1 Honda 
MC) but we all have to compromise.  I sold all except the Sqbk, and
got a newer bus, but then again, she got sold her '71 Corvette 'vert.

&gt; don't get tired of mechanic-ing when they have a full time job, don't
&gt; buy a volvo when they have kids, etc. 

There IS a period of time when it's VERY difficult to spend time away 
from the kids when they are very young.  But now that the youngest is 
5, I can find opportunity to be away from them.  There had been a few 
years of &quot;It's broke, I have to fix it&quot; type of mechanic'n.
Even still, the only time I find is late-night-after-the-kids-are-in-bed or 
the occasional weekend, but as a soccer coach, time is more limited.
Spent LOTS of time with vehicles when single with full time job.
At 9 the older one(s) are ready for some education in vehicles now, 
and have expressed some interest. (He wants the Sqbk ! ! !)

I have a Subaru that until recently my SO wouldn't let me touch.  
Does that count like Volvo? and would that be for or against me?

I can't get her to drive a bus, period.  After rolling in one she 
will NOT drive one again, but will tolerate being a passenger.

I find it encouraging that so many students are finding time and 
money to spend on their rides.  Working on a VW is an education in and 
of itself.  Really prepares one for the real world! of things not 
quite going like you planned, not quite what others prepared you for, 
and knowing that each of us (and vehicle) has their own *quirks*.

Happy mechanic'n ! ! !
