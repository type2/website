&gt;And some day I will have the tools and the books and fix him myself (with 
&gt;lots of your help) but right now I just don't have anywhere to do it. I 
&gt;can't bring him home, I'm thinking of looking for a place I can rent to 
&gt;park him. Like some cow pasture or something. Then I can go there and work 
&gt;on him all I want. :)

Two options: rent a storage unit where you can work. Did that for a while 
while I was in the NAVY in VA.

Other option: pull the engine in the parking lot and build the engine in 
your apartment. It's been done but you've got to keep it all clean.
