My beloved brown '77 FI 2000cc camper bus decided to get sick while I was in 
the gym today.  Her symptoms are :  When I start her, she backfires once, 
and then revs up to a REALLY high rpm range in a few seconds, and then dies.

I gave her a tune up (my first! heh) last sunday and she's been running
VERY well since then.  I adjusted the valves, set the timing and set the idle.

If anyone knows what this could possibly be please p-mail me, I'm stranded here
at work until I fix her :/

TIA!!
