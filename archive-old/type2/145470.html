Subject: Re: [T2] Dead Van in SF Update (Final!!!) ;-) trip report  

Great story but it sounds like you could some of  those rather 
expensive connectors and do a lot of re-soldering.   I've had problems like 
that also.  On my old starter, the  connector would not stay on for 30 
days at a time.  And it always  came off when I was parked in mud, rainy 
days, etc.  Glad you made  it OK.  I do love Frisco!  But take a coat.  
I was there  in the middle of June one time and nearly froze to death.   
Cheers....KR
  
The Van ran great until just outside of Corning (now I remember, that's
the town where the Olive Pit is). A short distance from the exit, the
water temp.  needle dropped to zero. When we pulled into the Olive Pit, I
pulled up the  engine lid, and saw the temp sensor wire had broken off of
the spade connector. It was a quick (5 minute) fix, recrimping the
connector.

We continued on into Oregon, where just after Grants Pass, on Sexton
Summit, the driver's side windshield wiper came loose. So, again, we were
right at an off ramp. We took the exit, and moved the wiper back to the
correct  position, and tightened the loose wipe mounting bolt. This task
was made  comfortable by the light and shelter of the little mom-and-pop
gas station at Sunny Valley. We bought snacks at the funky little store,
and took off.

In Sutherlin, OR, we stopped for fuel, both for the car, and for us. I
think this is the first time I have eaten food from A&amp;W in 20 years, or
so. But, my pop wanted a burger, and it was part of the gas station. We
got our food, and started out of the parking lot. Just before turning onto
the street, the van died.

My first thought was the station had mixed up tanks, and we were filled
with gasoline. A quick sniff test in the tank confirmed we were running
diesel.
