Subject: 76 westy sink cabinet for sale

i'm tired of this thing taking up space in the living room &amp;
i don't think i'll ever use it.

this model is the one that sits on the driver's side (US) of the
bus.  it holds the spare tire also.  some chipping on the cabinets,
but definitely still useable.  might need a couple of new handles too.
AFAIK everything is there, hardware, pump, water tank, etc.

50 bucks firm. i won't ship it, but can deliver to Everybus.
i might even help you install it for a cold beverage or three.

anyone interested please pmail me.

thanks,

Joel Wilson
