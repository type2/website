Subject: [T2] another question from lancaster.......

today i did some more work on my new bus to see what was up with the 
non-idle situation.  i found two hoses completley off their connections.  
still wouldn't idle.  then i found the source of a hissing air leak that 
occured when the car was running and after it stopped.  it came from a 
connection that as far as i can tell goes from the master cylinder to the 
intake manifold in the engine.

so here's what i did.  i disconnected the hose in the engine, and car ran 
and idled fine but the idle was high and non adjustable.  as soon as the 
connection was put back on the idle dropped severly and the engine soon 
stalled.  this was followed by a hissing noise as the air in the hose 
escaped the poor connection in the engine. it seems to me that there is 
something wrong with the thing attatched to the master cylinder, i believe 
its called a &quot;servo&quot; or something?  anyway, i checked for leaks along the 
way and there wasn't any, as far as i can tell theres vacuum all the way to 
the servo but then what?  what should i check?  i'm waiting for my bentley 
manual to come but it won't be here for another week, and i want to get this 
bus running!!  any suggestions would be immensely appreciated........

mark.
