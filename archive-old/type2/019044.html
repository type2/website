Back in 1985, we carried our daugher in a baby seat placed into the
REARWARD facing swivel seat, using a seatbelt I installed for rear
facing passengers.  Made paying attention to her needs safer for the
driver.  With a sub-30 lb kid this should be no problem.  The same load
is on the pedestal, so that does not change.  There is an increased load
on the seatback (like being hit in the rear), and I can, if driving an
adult this way, run the stock belt behind the seatback to insure its
support.
