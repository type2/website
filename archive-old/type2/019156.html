Subject: why is this happening?
Message-ID: &lt;38271A8C.FC3FD815_at_uiuc_dot_edu&gt;

Michelle and I just picked up our 78 Westy from Toronto this weekend and
drove her home to Urbana, IL (150 S. of Chicago). We had no problems all
weekend.  She is running better than ever.  I decided to drive her to
work today and I noticed that the VDO oil pressure gauge is acting
weird.  The whole trip it was at about 22 and stayed there. Now it is
acting like a tachometer.  It goes up to about 30 in first then I shift
to second and it drops down to about 20 and raises up again until I sift
into third.  Then it stays at about 24.  Why is this happening?  Thanks
for any help.
Sean and Michelle
