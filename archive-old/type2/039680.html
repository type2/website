&lt;&lt; areas. I don't believe roofing tar would be a very good product to use in
 these areas as it would just seal in any RUST that has already started. The
 3M product inhibits rust as well as sealing against it. Leave it to 3M to
 come up with this awesome product. COST retail 15.17 a can and 1 can will do
 both doglegs and a few door bottoms.

I have some family friends in England who have a 69 Morris Minor woody, since 
at least 74 which is whn I first saw it.  They paint the underside with used 
motor oil every year to help against rust.  oil/roofing tar keeps the air and 
water out, preventing rust, even if applyed over rust, i believe that is 
prevents more, not like painting over it with paint.  

of couse, this is not so asthetically pleasing, and if you want to paint it 
later, you need to thouroughly clean all that petroleum product off
