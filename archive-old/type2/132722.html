Subject: RE: [T2] SF to Seattle

&gt; The wife and I are almost done packing up PT ('75 Riviera)
&gt; and our borrowed Honda. Tomorrow morning we'll leave San
&gt; Francisco North on the 101, staying Tuesday night at
&gt; Mackerricher State Park (Fort Bragg area). Wednesday we'll
&gt; try to camp somewhere in Southern Oregon (any suggestions?).
&gt; On Thursday we'll visit the Tilamook cheese factory and spend
&gt; the night with friends in Portland. If everything goes well,
&gt; we'll roll into Seattle on Friday.

I did almost exactly the same trip just a few months ago, when I brought
my bus up from LA.  The trip was an incredible experience for me, one I
wish to repeat annually.

In the Fort Bragg area I camped right on the beach at van damme state
park, which is exactly 10 miles south of Fort Bragg, and about 2 miles
south of Mendicino.  It was beautiful to be able to sleep to the sound
of crashing waves and whale songs in the distance.

If you're netstumbling up the coast for internet access, then I found
Oregon to be extremely dry.  I did find an open 802.11 hotspot in, of
all places, a little dinky town about halfway up the Oregon coast called
Yachets.  Email me if you want the address.

I met up with a friend at Tillamook Cheese Factory and we drove to Bagby
Hot Springs, which is a little bit south east of Portland.  Then we
drove back towards the Oregon coast so we could dine at my favorite
Restaurant, in Astoria.  Crossing the bridge in Astoria in the bus is a
fun experience as well.  :)

From Astoria I pretty much made it to Seattle in a leisurely day of
driving.

Good luck, and have fun.
