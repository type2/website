What I do it run the bus for 20-30 minutes about 11pm at night to make sure the lifters are pumped up. Not really necessary if you drive your bus everyday but if it's been sitting then you need to do this.

Next morning when the engine is cold again you can do your seal replacement. No one likes working on a warm motor even though you could probably adjust hydraulic valves without it being stone cold.

You should check the state of your adjustment screws. It's less of an issue for hydraulic motors in my opinion because the head makes contact as you do your adjustment but you should consider replacing them with new ones if they look faceted. They have a nice shiny radiused look when new.

I'm sure someone will recommend upgrading to a better style of adjustment screw that can fit the 10mm bore of the rocker otherwise get the screws from the VW dealer only because they have the correct hardness. I believe all hydraulic motors have 10mm valvetrains but someone may have put in 8mm hardware from another motor.
