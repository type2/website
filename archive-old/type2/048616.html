The Jester, 69 sends:

&gt; Now, the volkswagen type 1 was designed for ND oil, wasnt it... So wouldnt
&gt; anything exceeding SA be okay?
&gt; 
&gt; I dont think they've changed the lubricating properties of oil as they go
&gt; to the newer ratings, just the detergent and multiweight additives?  So
&gt; wouldnt anything exceeding SA be fine?

According to my Bentleys (Type 1 1970-up and Type 2 loaf), Volkswagen wants
API Service SC oil in the 1600-up engines.
