Jerry,

        Hey...on my last inspection ('69 Daily), I just told the guy that
my bus &quot;NEVER&quot; came with high beams.  The poor guy had to go and check with
his supervisor.  His supervisor says, &quot;Well, heck, if he doesnt have 'em,
we can't count it against him!&quot;  I had both guys inspecting the driver-side
floormat for some type of hole where the switch may have
been...ha...ha...ha....And, of course, my horn barely gave a honk noise as
I pushed the button with one hand and tapped the horn below with my foot. 
I Got my inspection, though.....I LOVE Oklahoma!

        Seriously though, you know whatcha got to do.  Get out your trusty
12v testing light and trace power from the fuse box to where the juice
stops.  They are prolly on two separate fuses as well.  A wiring diagram is
available on the TYPE2.COM homepage's REFERENCE area.

Good luck,

Josh

______YOU WROTE:____________
The Frosted Pumpkin (1972) has no brights. Pull back on the turn signal arm
and...nothing. Turn signals work great. I replaced the relay, no change.
Replaced the whole flippin' turn signal/dimmer switch and arm, no change.
FLAPS tels me to run a hot wire to the #30 pole on the dimmer relay,
because newer relays need more juice to trip them than older relays. Is
this true, and where should I run a wire from if it is? I can't run on the
highway until I get an inspection sticker and I can't get an inspection
sticker until I have brights...
