Hello all,

I just would like to know what would cause my BN4 fan to just quit. There was no
notice at all.  It worked fine for months, then I didn't use it for a couple
weeks.  When I tried it the timer knob of course made it's little noise, but no
fan noise at all.  What can I check?  I've checked fuses, namely the ones inside
the van and one that seemed to be connected to the heater. 
Thanks!

I think there should be something in science called 
the &quot;reindeer effect.&quot; I don't know what it
would be, but I think it'd be good to hear
someone say, &quot;Gentlemen, what we have 
here is a terrifying example of the reindeer 
effect.&quot;
