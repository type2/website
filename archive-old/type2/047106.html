Subject: Re: [T2] strange noise-78 Bus

Thanks to all that responded. In my search for deviant sound I found a loose
exhaust, and a motor mount torn in half. These were not the problem.  It was
a loose rear shock. Took less than a full turn and the noise disappeared.
THANKS ALL!
I've tightened the exhaust but what kind of problems could a torn motor
mount present?

&gt; I see a lot of threads with this title (sorry) but this one has me
&gt; perplexed. It's coming from the rear and sounds EXACTLY like when  the
rear
&gt; hatch is not closed tightly (not the case) - a loud  annoying rattling
when
&gt; I hit a bump. I had my wife drive while I climbed in the back - still
&gt; couldn't isolate sound. This started about a month ago.
