Last night I was driving and my 74 bus was running great, I stopped and came 
back in about an hour. It started right up, but when I went to shift into 
first, it didn't go, I tried several times, so I turned the bus off and it 
shifts into all the gears just fine. I started it with the clutch in and in 
first and it wanted to die, but it didn't move forward. Then when I was on 
my way back home it was nearly impossible to shift into second and third 
gear. Is this a clutch problem that can be fixed without removing the 
engine? Or is it the transmission? Nothing happened to the bus between the 
two times I drove it, yet the change was immediate.

Thanks, Nathan
