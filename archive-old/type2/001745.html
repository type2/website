 &gt; In my opinion the regular (non-German) fuel line
&gt; seems to hold up much better. This is just my opinion.
&gt; I went to the FLAPS and got standard fuel
&gt; line and clamps for all connections.


CAUTION!  John is referring to plain old low-pressure (carbourated) fuel
line here, and he is probably right that on a carbourated bus you can use
the standard stuff as long as the fit is right. If your bus is fuel
injected, however, **DO NOT** use stock American fuel line.  This is a fire
waiting to happen. The special German high-pressure line ($6.95/meter
through me, also available from your dealer, et. al.) is designed to handle
the significantly higher fuel pressure used on fuel injected busses. If you
use anything else, proceed at your own (very substantial) risk.
