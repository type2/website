Hmmmmm,
6=1976 model year
00002 second vehicle produced

The above is just a guess but I would bet that the bus was produced 
at Hanover on the date listed on the M plate but Westfalia did the 
conversion based on 1976 model year specs. That would make it a 
pretty neat bus to own especially if you lived in an area where 
vehicles in the 1975 and earlier are exempt from emissions and you 
just have to have a 1976 Westy interior.

Cool bus Jamie!
