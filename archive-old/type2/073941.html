Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Tank Issues

&gt; I too have this problem, specifically when I fill the tank.  For some

actually that is caused by having pumps set for the smaller unleaded gas
fills , and most buses have the bigger leaded filler.  

if they put em in a little differently they won't stay on??

&gt; and I end up having gas spew out of the driver's side bottom.  I 
&gt; Don't fill the tank past 3/4 and that seems to address the 
&gt; issue, although there are still fumes.
