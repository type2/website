&gt; On occasions I have read references to cow magnets and their use in
engine

simply shade

spin on 
&gt; filters? Used in conjunction with the filter or only in the absence
of a 
&gt; filter? Placed in the crankcase? How? Myth or creative solution?
What's the 
&gt; story?

Magnets are efficient collectors of ferrous particles, so they do
provide a filtering function of sorts.  They are commonly used in
drain plugs of transmissions, which have a lot more steel-on-steel
running parts than engines.

Cow magnets do exactly that, collecting ingested metallic particles
&gt;from the digestive system of cows.

As far as VW engines go, I really don't know where you would put a cow
magnet.  You'd be better off with a &quot;donut&quot; shaped magnet from a old
speaker, which you could stick onto the sump plate.  I don't know if
this would help, since most metallic debris in an engine is
non-ferrous, but it probably wouldn't hurt anything.

For heaven's sake, though, don't remove a magnet after you have
applied it unless you are draining the oil, as you might release a
gout of ferrous particles into the oil system all at once!
