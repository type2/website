Okay, I'll bite.  I've wondered what the actual purpose of the &quot;black box&quot;
on the speedo cable is, any answers?
 &gt;&gt;

It mechanically counts the miles and informs you (by lighting up the OXS/
EGR, I forget...), that your FI system needs servicing. Modern cars go
way beyond that (one that I know of has a sensor that should indicate
an over full canister for gas tank fumes; but fill the tank to the neck
and it lights up automatically). Michelin is trying out a 'chipped' tire to
warn of under/over inflation and worn tread (we won't go into the track-
ing aspect of the chip...)
On the other hand, even the Good Grey NY Times had an article on modern
hot rodders called, &quot;Gentlemen, Hack Your Engines&quot;, lightly viewing the neo-
shade-tree-mechanic wielding a lap-top rather than an box wrench... ;-)
