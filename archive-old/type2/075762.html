Subject: Re: [T2] Need a wheel to steer

     As for the puller, I bought a puller set from Habor Freight for $29.00.  
In the set is what is know as a bearing splitter AKA clam shell.  When its 
bolted together if forms a circle with a hole in the center.  So basically 
you put it together under the steering wheel with the shaft going though the 
center(you gotta pull your turn signal stuff for more room.  Anyway once it's 
on, its just a matter of screwing in the puller stuff (pretty much a two arm 
puller, but in uses bolts instead of arms.) It's makes it so easy!!  At a 
recent all you can carry at a local wrecking yard I pulled a total of 6 
wheels off of several makes of cars.  I know some folks look down on Habor 
Freight, I myself have never had a problem with them.  They have a store here 
in Eugene and have yet to give me a problem on returns.  It's amazing what an 
8 foot cheater bar can do to  a socket.  I've had more trouble with Sears 
returning un-abused stuff, than I have with HF and abused stuff.  And frankly 
I have just gotten tired of returning ratchets back to Sears every 6 months!  
I once stood in line with to other guys with the same problem with the same 
ratchet!
     As for Bus wheels, just a friendly reminder.  VW made bus steering 
wheels big for a reason!  I swap out a formal france wheel once on my 69'.  
The wheel didn't fix proper.  I just wanted to see what it looked like.  It 
looked way cool.  So I tighten it up, still didn't fit right, I was just 
gonna play in the drive way.  Jez's talk about a work out!! Needless to say, 
I got my bus turned around and put the stocker back on, once I caught my 
breath!!
                                                                          
Peace,
