Hi folks,

I was assembling a 1600 DP for my 71 Campmobile that was recently acquired.
I noticed that the heat exchangers were for a bug, with the heater cable
connecting on the bottom, outside of the exchanger. I removed the circlip
holding the lever to the exchanger, removed the lever. Reduced the angle of
the fork, where the post with the circlip mounts. Then I straightened the
rest of the lever, getting all the factory bends out of it.
I measured the distance from the post to the top of the exchanger, scribed a
line on the lever and bent it across the top of the exchanger, with room for
clearance. Then I bent the remaining 2&quot; of the lever straight up. I fastened
the lever to the fixed lever that controls the flap.
I installed the exchangers on the engine, and later installed the engine.

The Heater cables line up almost perfectly and now work. This saved me the
time and expense of finding a new or used set of type II heater boxes and
was quite handy, as I had the bug exchanger in good condition. I plugged a
small hole with this metal putty I bought at the autoparts store. I've fixed
two set of heater boxes so far. It sets up in about an hour, and basically
turns to iron or something close to it.

It looks something like this...

               Attach Heat cable here ---------&gt;|   Old lever that was
                                                |   attached with Spring

Enjoy this one folks, I'm not sure if you already now about this, or if it
is in the archives, but I'm new and wanted to share this with the group...
