&gt; &gt;Greetings Esteemed List,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         I found a cheap gasoline rated (with Viton seals) manual fuel
&gt; &gt;shutoff valve listed in McMaster Carr's online catalog.  If you go to
&gt; =========================&gt;
&gt; First thought on my end........
&gt; Use the standard design with 360 degree rotation, and equipped with flare 

I use an all brass ball valve. (actually two of them)
&gt; 
&gt; I would install it immediately at the fuel line to tank interface, coming 
&gt; immediately off of the tank nipple.
&gt; If it leaks, ever, it will be to ground, and not to a hot surface.

since I have FI, I have two fuel lines and I have banded one ball valve to
the frame rails one each side as close to the fuel tank as I could get
without major surgery,   debating how to put a choke cable on the fuel
pump side ball valve so I could cut it off by pulling the lever in the
cab.

&gt; What do others say??

that's what I did several years ago, great when changing filter and
pulling engine,  have changed a filter with a full tank of gas and only
lost the gas in the filter itself
