Subject: Re: 70 Westy sink/icebox unit pictures

All,

Okay, this is a prime example of what I was talking
about!!! These pics from a '70 are nothing like the
unit in my '69! 

Mine has a small stainless basin (barely larger than
the sink (roughly the size of a half-pan, for those of
you in the restaurant biz ;-) and no drain...you pull
the basin out and dump it manually.

Also, Sam's is the first one I've actually seen that
has a vent shaft on the right and filler on the left
(as you face the unit). Mine has only the filler, but
it's on the right (as you face it).

Another difference....my sink also has the manual
water pump, but the lever is smaller, has no black
knob and is on the opposite side of the
faucet.....faucet's smaller, with a sharper bend on
mine, too! 

I didn't see the plastic drain-tray inside the fridge,
either....maybe they didn't all have them?

One more thing....Sam, why do you have to rest the
table on the rear-facing seat???!!! If it's that long,
how does anyone sit in the seat when the table's down?
On mine, it doesn't reach that far, and it rests on
the bracket I mentioned before....

You'd think those Westfalia boys could've been
satisfied with one or two design packages, instead of
the dozens of permutations that we've all
seen....sheesh!


Also...to all who have requested that I scan my '69
Westy manual and put it on my site.......I'll try and
do it today. I'm currently revamping the entire site,
so be patient if it looks disorganized when you get
there ;-/ Also, the link below my signature is to my
*old* site; I will post the new link when I'm done.
