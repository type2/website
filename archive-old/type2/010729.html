Subject: My weekend with Lurch (CHT gauge)
To: type2-digest_at_lenti.type2_dot_com
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I spent the better part of the weekend fixing Lurch.

The transmission had been howling and popping out of fourth for about the 
last 8,000 miles.  During the last tune-up, I had discovered that #3 
compression was _at_ 95 (vs. 120 for all the others).  &quot;That is probably why my 
vacuum gauge oscillates madly at idle.&quot; I thought.

I pulled both tranny and engine out after work on Friday.  Saturday I had 
school all day.  Sunday I did repairs on the engine.  I put on a used head 
from another project engine I had in the garage.  I had the heater boxes from 
that engine welded up (plus I had a stud welded onto the #3 exhaust pipe for 
a CHT gauge).  I replaced some tin that had fatigued out.

I had posted to the list about the head -- I couldn't get the #3 exhaust 
valve to adjust.  I finally had to grind the rocker for that valve so it 
would clear and leave room for the adjusting screw.

I swapped parts from the old tranny to the &quot;new&quot; one and put it back in 
Sunday.

By the way, A BIG THANKS to Boyd Smith for the gift of the mystery 
transmission.

The engine went in yesterday (Monday) after work.  After uncrossing a coupla 
spark plug wires, it cranked up within one revolution like it used to.  What 
a thrill!  Everything in the instrument cluster reads spot on!  The CHT gauge 
reads higher, however.  Anyone out there experience readings of 375 with the 
sender mounted near the #3 exhaust port?  The old sender was mounted under a 
&quot;stud&quot; right above the #3 spark plug (it had been broken for nearly a year) 
and it would max out at about 350.

I don't need a bungee cord anymore to hold it in fourth!  It was getting 
pretty bad before, the bungee had been tightened twice, and it was STILL 
popping out.

I am sooooo excited -- like a kid in a candy store!  I'm going to a music 
festival this weekend (for my birthday) and Lurch is ready, by god!
