Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temps and Breather Boxes

&gt;Not really in combination but two questions. Donning flame suit for first
&gt;one... Oil temp guage was reading 230-250 yesterday on the highway cruising
&gt;between 65-70 mostly around 70. This is a 78 t4. Head temps hovered around
&gt;350. The engine runs great. Timing and dwell are on. If this is too hot
&gt;what should I try to do to lower it. I'm running castrol 20W50.

What is your oil pressure?  If pressure is good (at least 30 at that speed/temp, preferably closer to 40) then I wouldn't worry too much if I had synthetic oil.  With dino oil, well... I don't have any experience with it at those temps so I couldn't tell you.  I've run synthetic in my bus for the last 100,000+ miles.

&gt;Next question is if anyone is using a breather box with their valve covers
&gt;vented? 

Yes.  I read your other reply and I had always thought that the rocker cover area was connected to the crankcase via the pushrod tubes.  I remember there being holes in the lifter bores to facilitate this, but I can't swear you are right or wrong without a disassembled engine in front of me.  I can say that switching to vented valve covers didn't do squat for my oil leak problem.  I still have occasional leaks from the covers, and from the breather box area.
