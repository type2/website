Thanks for your comments.

The heater my friend obtained appears to be new/unused.  It didn't come in a
box, with installation instructions and specifications, but there's no sign
of wear or markings from sump fasteners and the cord and plug are
unblemished.

The &quot;business end&quot; of the heater is ~ the same size as the sump plate.  With
such a small contact area, against the large, cold, mass of
aluminum/magnesium engine case, flywheel housing, and transaxle case, it
just doesn't seem like 150 watts would have much effect.

An effective sump heater would be very useful at a number of locations we
frequent in winter, but the remoteness of most of those places means no
available 110V power.  It would take another bus to haul the many miles long
extension cord to make the heater work :)

Forty+ years ago, courtesy of Uncle Sam, I was wrestling heavy-duty trucks
in severe winter cold.  Cold engines, transmissions, and transfer cases were
a big problem, and we tried all sorts of &quot;field expedient&quot; heating
strategies.  I always packed some of my civilian mountaineering gear,
including a pair of SVEA stoves, and we discovered that stoves under the
crankcase and transmission effectively warmed things up in 15 or 20 minutes.
Once the engine was started we'd use that stove to defrost the frozen
parking brakes, and by then the tranny would be ready to go as well.

This would NOT be a safe strategy with a VW bus!!!  I expect in short order
a bus would be entirely _too_ hot, and the rapid re-cooling effected by
dousing the engine with CO2 would probably crack the case :)

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Actually, 150 watts can be pretty hot.  Alot of the heat will be
dissipated through the metal of the engine, but if you give it some time,
150 watts will be enough to warm the oil and engine so that it will start
easier on
those cold mornings.  &lt;&lt;
