Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Very Intermittent Loss of Power

Aren't the Pertronix and other &quot;point replacing&quot;
systems out there for use on non FI systems?

&gt; In your original post you said you were all stock
&gt; except for a Pertronix.  
&gt; Don't rule out the posibility that it is causing
&gt; your problem.  I experienced a 
&gt; really wierd intermittent problem on my 73 (dying
&gt; when cold) for a year and 
&gt; tried a LOT of different things to fix it.  I
&gt; Finally removed the Pertronix and 
&gt; the problem is now gone.  Not saying this is your
&gt; problem, but it is pretty 
&gt; easy (and cheap) to swap back in the
&gt; points/condensor and check it out.
