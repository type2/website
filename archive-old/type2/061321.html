Subject: Idiot adjusts his valves

	In April 1997 I bought a 1974 hardtop with the original engine, a 
type 4 1800 with dual Solex carbs, and more or less admired it from afar 
until recently when my daily driver Subaru was totalled. Feeling guilty, 
armed with the Muir manual, I gave the bus its first (to my knowledge) 
home-grown valve adjustment. I managed to completely ignore Muir's advice 
in setting the distributor to the piston #1 firing notch, but instead, if 
memory serves, left it on #3 (directly opposite the notch), with the 
timing notch on the flywheel properly placed at 0 degrees on the little 
timing strip. After that blunder, and noticing that the valves all around 
seemed REALLY tight, I proceeded to set intake at .006&quot; and exhaust at 
.008&quot;. It runs a lot louder now, but seems happy. Warms up easier. Just 
looking at the mistake and me saying &quot;it sure seems okay&quot; is enough to 
make me cringe a little, though.
	So the question: since it's a 4-stroke engine, shouldn't the 
valves on cylinders #1 and 3 be in the same position at TDC for #1? 
Couldn't one feasibly open both valve covers, and reset valves on each 
side in tandem rather than hand-cranking the engine all the way round
(i.e, #1 and #3 at #1 or #3 TDC, and then #s 2 and 4 in the same fashion)?
Or did I just totally screw up and set my valves super-loose? 

	Thanks in advance, 
	Ian

Thanks too to David Goldberg, who set me straight on some of this 
abbreviation business. I was feeling like a ninny for awhile there.
