The Porsche flywheel is about a 1/4'' thicker. This moves the ring teeth closer
to the trans. [the Porsche flywheel has a deeper recess because the disc has a
thicker anti-vibration spring]

&gt; &gt;NO!   The self supporting starter will NOT work on a 2.0L with a 228mm
flywheel.
&gt; &gt;No way no how. If he has a 76, he has a 228 flywheel. It will not engage the
&gt; &gt;teeth. It will work on a 2.0L with an auto trans.
&gt;
&gt; I did not know that ! I've been using a self-supporting starter on a Porsche
911
&gt; engine with a Porsche 228 flywheel for years.( What am i doing wrong ?! &lt;:^)
&gt; Porsche 914 flywheel ring gear teeth are mounted 1/8 &quot; closer to the
transaxle,
&gt; and i have the same measurement with my combination of  911 / vw parts,
&gt; requiring a slight clearancing in the 76 vw manual trans for the flywheel to
clear
&gt; the bellhousing, both on the o.d. circumference and at the four bolt casting
places.
&gt; I am using a 76 911 Euro Carrera flywheel, and a 228mm feramic ( metal )
6-puck clutch pack.
&gt; Perhaps the 2.0 vw flywheel is not working with the self-supporting starter
for the opposite
&gt; clearance problem, being 1/8&quot; further  back from engagement. Another good
reason to
&gt; install the &quot; improved&quot; acnonvw engine.Or perhaps the 914 flywheel will make
it work
&gt; in the 76 2.0 Bus. We need to go check the engagement distance of the two
starters.
