Subject: backfire

You didn't mention what kind of exhaust system you have.  My experience with
headers, especially older ones-on AC engines and other-backfiring is pretty
common, whether due to leaking gasket(s) (its tough to keep the thin metal
on headers to not leak) or maybe not enough backpressure (have you ever
listened to a vehicle with straight pipes).  A sizable hole in a muffler
will do it too. The backfiring mainly comes  immediately after a rev, and
when downshifting.  Its always scared me to death, knowing it couldn't be
good for the engine.  My 77 bus has older headers, and it backfires just a
little.  (enough for me to worry, probably will buy a new system when I have
the bucks.   Thats my 2 cents worth anyway.

&gt; Hey Volks, My bus keeps backfiring. It seems like it
&gt; does it more often when I'm downshifting
