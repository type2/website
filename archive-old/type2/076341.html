&gt; I am interested in turning the single seat in the back into a cooler.  This 
&gt; is the seat that is in between the closet and table.  I know someone who 
&gt; works in plastics that can fit a lining to it, but I am having some trouble 
&gt; coming up with a way to drain it.  My husband thinks we can have the lining 
&gt; be removable, and just lift it out to empty it, but I would rather not do 
&gt; that as it just puts strain on the plastic and my back.  I would appreciate 
&gt; any suggestions as to how to drain it out the side of the bus.

couple ideas, 

. try to find a commercial ice chest that will drop into the space
. my favorite, use dry ice
. take and put a drain on the inside and some tubing, unroll the tubing
out the door when draining.  buck or two at the local big box hardware
store.
