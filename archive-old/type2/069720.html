Subject: Re: Rounded Valve Adjustment Nut ie: Rem

My favorite valve adjust tool is an OFFSET 13mm (or 1/2&quot;) box wrench- lets
you save the knuckles from hitting head, and lets you &quot;play&quot; the adjusting
screw as you control tightness of the locknut without adjusting screw
creeping forward.  1/2&quot; is tighter if your not is rounded, and yes, you
should use a SIX sided socket just for the LOOSENING process, or the rare
bird, a six-sided box wrench, which I found at Sears in the bargain bin-
it's too short; if used, I TAP it with a hammer.  MB in NJ
