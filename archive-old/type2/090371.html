Subject: 185/195 Size question

&gt;&gt;Looking at 185's vs. 195's on Tires for my 71
Westy (1600cc).......Got the
right tire it's just a matter of what width..
There are 185's on the bus
now...Thoughts , draw backs ????


Trey, I answered you offlist a couple of days
ago, but I will answer again and add a little. 

185 and 195 are the widths.  185R14C or 185R14Rf
is the stock size.  That tire is about 25.7 tall.
 You will not go wrong with one of the 185R14C. 
I think you were looking at Vredestein's, right? 
  

When you said 195 earlier, I assumed 195R14C. 
That tire is a bit taller, like 26.3.  I've run
it on a wasserboxer and a 1.8 but not on a 1600. 
No problem with the taller tire on the larger
engines, but who knows with the lesser HP of the
1600.  (Of course, you have lower gearing- maybe
that makes up for the hp.)  I noted that my
speedo was dead on with the 195R14C.  That tire
is almost always a &quot;load range D&quot; tire.  Bottom
line is that any taller tire will be like adding
a &quot;freeway flier&quot; tranny.  Less ooomph on the
hills and when pulling out, and more top end. 
Whether this works for you depends on what kind
of engine you have and where you drive.  

If you mean a 195/75/14 tire, hopefully a
LT195/75/14 tire, that is a little smaller than
stock.  (I'm not aware of Vredestein offering
these.)  The speedo is off with a stock tire and
will be slightly more off with the smaller tire. 
Reviews of these tires are mixed.  Some like them
and most of the LT195/75/14 have sufficient max
pressure (45 psi +) but very marginal load
ratings at only 1435lbs, less than a standard
185R14 and significantly less than a 185R14Rf.  

My tire page has a bunch of this stuff.  

What ever you do, get something with appropriate
load range or max load and appropriate max
pressure.
