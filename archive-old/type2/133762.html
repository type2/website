Subject: Re: [T2] Richard Atwell's website

From: Stevie Havoc

You know someone really autta buy Richard some hosted web space so
www.RichardAtwell_dot_com  can have a home. His site is an invaluable
resource of information and inspiration when you have taken
something apart and feel like its a long road until its back
together.

Anyone want to start a collection ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will contribute. Where do you want to start?  I use Richard's Site and 
&quot;help at times&quot; almost if not more so than I use my Bentley(of course I do 
consult Bentley he is always hanging around my shop). What a wealth of 
information! Detail is where it's at and Richard's site goes beyond the 
detail of most sites and manuals, being a combination of them both. Then 
there is the hard to find stuff the tools and gadgets(that's one of my 
favorite parts). &quot;Where does he get those wonderful toys.&quot;

Count me In,
