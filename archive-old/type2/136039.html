Subject: [T2]oil coming out of dipstick(update)

ok so i have done all sorts of stuff
1.oil breather cleaned
2_dot_compression test
3.patched inside of metal tube inside fan armor (in case of small hole)
4.adjusted valves
5.corked off dipstick with tube(to form a seal around dipstick so i could stil use it)
6.set timing
 
i ran the bus first time in a week this morning and once again there is oil everywhere and it is deffinelty coming out of the dipstick i can see it plain as day,but only when the bus drives down the road not sitting at idle can it be seen.
someone help me here&gt;?
i got to figure out why oil would be coming out of the dipstick hole?
i can plug the hole offf (which is defeateing the purpose)and tote the dipstick around and then undo the plug and check oil or fix whatever is really wrong with the engine and why it keeps shooting it out of the dipstick hole.
this is a must i am out of ideas and expecially when compression checks out./
 
thanks for any or all advice this has been a real headache and mess
peace and love
chris

peace and love
chris
