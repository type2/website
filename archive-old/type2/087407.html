Subject: Propane Heaters/Stuff for Sale at EveryBus

Folks, with the installation for a BN-2 Eberspacher as an aux heater for my ' 
78 Westy, I find I have no further use for two portable propane heaters. One 
is a Mr. Heater portable Buddy, and the other is a Coleman PowerCat. Both are 
in excellent working and cosmetic condition. I'd like to get 65.00 for the 
Mr. Heater Buddy (that's 35.00 less than retail) and 45.00 for the Coleman 
(30.00 off retail). I've also got another fully functional BN-2 if anyone is 
interested, along with a bunch of misc. bus/westy parts including the 
complete child's cot, in excellent condition, and brackets, from my ' 78. I'm 
running Vanagon Cap. t's chairs and don't need it. I'll be at EB, so pmail me 
if you're interested in any of this crap. 
Thanks,
Robert
