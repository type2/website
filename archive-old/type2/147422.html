Subject: Re: [T2] Just like that, BOOM! Another setback..

&gt;&gt; Yes, a spark at wrong time will cause this. If a exhaust valve is open it blows out the exhaust, if an intake
&gt;&gt; valve is open it blows thru the carb/FI.
&gt;&gt; This is why you never put hose clamps on the air/vacuum hoses except on the ends of the big S hose.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm trying to figure out how an exploded muffler could destroy the AFM.
&gt; The only way I can think of is if the pressure fed back through the EGR
&gt; pipe and valve (does this year have one?) or if the spark occurred exactly

Hey George,
If you look at what Karl wrote, I think what he's saying is if the 
exhaust valve is open during the misfire, then you get the backfire in 
the exhaust (exploded muffler).  However, if the intake is open during 
the misfire, then you mess up the AFM (but not the exhaust).
