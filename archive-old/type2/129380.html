Subject: Ignition switch problems :-(

Hi All,

So I just replaced my battery, the old one would no longer take a 
charge, and tried to start my bus. It wouldn't start, no click, just a 
slight dimming of the headlights.

I began running thru the troubleshooting steps in the Muir book and it 
would seem that I have ignition switch troubles. I can get the solenoid 
to spin the starter and I can short the ignition with the battery line 
on the solenoid to start the engine.

My question is this: The previous owner wired in a stereo that powers on 
as soon as the key is in the ignition. Could this be part of my 
troubles? Or should I start looking to replace the ignition switch?

I'm really unfamiliar with electrical problems so any advice would be 
greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Harry
