&gt; &gt; timing light:
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
http://www.harborfreight_dot_com/cpi/ctaf/displayitem.taf?Itemnumber=3343
&gt; $12.99

If I was to invest in another timing light, I'd get
one with adjustable advance / retard feature
regardless $$.
 
&gt; &gt; BRAKE BLEEDER &amp; VACUUM PUMP KIT
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
http://www.harborfreight_dot_com/cpi/ctaf/Displayitem.taf?itemnumber=92474
&gt; 0-30 inches Hg
&gt; $19.99
I tested several bleeder set-ups about a year ago. Not
this one. All the cheap ones with tanks leaked to much
to work. Don't know about this one. The hand vacuum
pump is very handy for a lot of stuff.

&gt; 
&gt; Or, should I go with the vac and pressure in one? 
&gt; Are the gauge ranges
&gt; on the one below acceptable?  The price sure is
&gt; right.

&gt; &gt; FUEL PUMP AND VACUUM TESTER
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
http://www.harborfreight_dot_com/cpi/ctaf/displayitem.taf?Itemnumber=93547
&gt; Tests output pressure to 10 PSI
&gt; Read vacuum to 28&quot; HG
&gt; $12.99

This is just a vacuum gauge with pressure side also. I
don't know what yer bus is, but if FI, pressure gauge
needs to be waaaayyyy up there and built to handle
gasoline. FI rail pressure up to about 40psi but can
go over 100 if you do something stupid!

Vacuum gauge is nice to have for general diagnoses. If
the needle flicks at approximately one half of engine
RPM you may have a bad valve at one cylinder or if it
more than flicks, you may have a broken ring. I use it
to tell me if I should do a compression check.

I just got back from HF - I got out of there with only
the one thing I went there for - a replacement tool
box for the plastic one that I sheared the latch off
of! -BaH
