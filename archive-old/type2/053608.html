Subject: gas tank support arm

Volks,
I am in the process of replcing my gas tank on my 82 westy. I received the
tank frm Ron at BD,corners bent but otherwise looks OK. What I have also
been lookin for is the drivers side gas tank support arm. I just struck out
at all the used parts locations that I know. Can anyone help me find this
support arm? Any help appreciated. Also, does anyone know if the gas tanks
&gt;from BD should be rinsed out? Is there some coating inside the tank that is
gonna clog up my fuel filters? Yes,filters,plural. I have one before the
pump and after. Thanks

TIA
