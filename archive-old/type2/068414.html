&gt; I thought it was just me!  I've driven my '85 Vanagon daily for almost a

&gt; back and forth in various combinations until I feel something come out. The 
&gt; hieroglyphic labeling is useless, and the operation counterintuitive.

Ditto! on Ron's procedure. Although, in the Vanagon the knobs move right
and left. Besides, given a stock VW's lack of bells and whistles (knobs
and switches), playing with the heater controls give us a chance to work
out some childhood fantasies ...
