Subject: Bug-O-Rama-Ban

This is getting more interesting...  I sent a note to Larry Hole, to let
him know that I wouldn't be attending Bug-O-Rama this year in support of
free speech, and in rejection of his &quot;ban&quot; of Thom. (If you don't know of
what I speak, go look at http://www.type2_dot_com for a moment.)

Not 5 minutes after I sent the message, I recieved a phone call from
Larry... &quot;You don't know the whole story!&quot; he protested.  To be fair, I
suggested he tell me his reasons for banning Thom.  To sum up his lengthy
diatribe, it comes down to this:  Larry and his father don't like what
Thom said about their cutting up classics to make hot rods. Thom wouldn't
take it back.  So they banned him.  End of story.

Now, I was ready for some long complaint about bad business dealings or
personal grudges, but I was really surprised at just how simple the story
appears to be!  Larry's rationale for the ban was &quot;we have the right to
refuse service to anybody.&quot;

I tried to explain to Larry that I really could care less what Thom had
said, but that banning someone from a semi-public event for exercising
their right to free speech really didn't cast the show in a good
light... At which point personal slurs against Mr. Fitzpatrick and more
general slurs against the VW e-mail communities issued from
Mr. Hole.  When his father got on the phone line too, I offered that we
had nothing further to discuss, and rang off.

So, they obviously are sensitive to their image at this point (as
witnessed by their lengthy personal phone call to me) -- but I didn't get
a warm fuzzy feeling that they would rescind the ban.

Let's hear it for the power of free speech!
