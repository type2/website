&gt; Ok, I've run into a slight problem with the rebuild of my 2.0. The first

&gt; either side of the engine? The reason I ask this is I've put the heads on

except for the threads for the temp sensor, and a blow by port the heads
are identical, and many rebuilders and later heads are built with the
fittings on all heads to be put on either side...
