&amp;gt; Read your post with interest.  So you pay up to $1.70US a gallon.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Just for your information/interest, here in Australia we are paying
&amp;gt; around $A1.35 per litre.  Converting that to US gallons is about
&amp;gt; $A5.35 gallon.  At current rates of one Australian dollar being equal
&amp;gt; to 0.75 US cents that equates to $A6.35 per gallon.  Continue to
&amp;gt; enjoy your cheap fuel for a while longer!!

One thing to examine is the completely different tax and social structures
of the countries we are comparing.  In the US, we don't have (for example)
any form of national health insurance, so each individual pays for their
own health insurance.  Other countries have health care systems paid for
by tax revenue, including fuel taxes.  Since we don't have the health care
program we don't have to pay the taxes for them, so our fuel costs are
lower.

Some countries simply use fuel taxation as a social engineering tool.
Want to have your population embrace mass transit?  Simply make it
artificially expensive to drive.

The current runup in fuel prices in the US has nothing to do with this.
It is simply a result in speculation in fuel futures.  Whenever there is
some bad news there are people called &amp;quot;futures traders&amp;quot; who promise to
sell fuel at a future date for a fixed price.  They don't actually have
the fuel, but they are gambling that fuel will be available at a lower
price then the price at which they agreed to sell.

Unfortunately, there seems to be a considerable business built up in &amp;quot;bad
news&amp;quot;.  Prices shoot up, not with news of disaster, but with news of
_potential_ disasters.  The futures traders make a lot of money and we
pay it.

Bus content?  Well I have a 10 gallon aux tank that is likely to go on the
roof rack.  If I have to pay a lot for gas I might as well not pay as
often.
