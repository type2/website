&gt;About a $1/sqft vs $6/sqft for similar stuff

Ooooh boy.  I looked at the picture and this is the SAME STUFF that I have,
which I described in my previous post.  I bought it in Canada at a large
home improvement store.  sounddeadeningmaterial_dot_com is in Canada - what a
coincidence!  I paid about $35US for the 90 sq. foot roll that they want
$90 for (and I am now asking $8 for).  I see how those guys are making
their money.

Here's a quote from their web site.  Note the part about no refund or
return if you're not satisfied with the product:

==============
We can not accept any liability if anything goes wrong with the shipping,
                              if you fail to use the product correctly, if
deadening results aren't to your
                               satisfaction, etc. We also cannot process
refunds or accept any returns.

                Examine the entire website for all of the information we
have on the product and if you have any more questions,
                 please write, and we will answer as best as we can, as
fast as we can. Anything more we cannot help you with.

                   We have no delusions of getting rich by distributing
this material so inexpensively. We are trying to make
                    a point that true customer service is not a myth, and
customers actually CAN find a good deal without
                          having to worry about being cheated, getting an
inferior product, or being ripped off.

                    Thanks for understanding, and if you have benefited
from using the material, SPREAD THE WORD!! :)

Oh I will, I will.
