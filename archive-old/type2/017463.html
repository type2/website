Tom:

I will p-mail you a diagram that I just sketched.  This is why I said
that the Owner's Manual had a diagram &quot;of sorts&quot;.  Neither VW nor
Bentley show a complete vacuum diagram, instead treating the vacuum
circuits separately, as parts of either the fuel system or the emissions
control system, and their vacuum diagrams are as inscrutable as their
&quot;current track&quot; approach to electrical schematics.

I think the one that's puzzling you is probably the small vacuum port in
the intake air distributor that is between the intake runners that go to
cylinders 1 and 2.  That one supplies vacuum to the fuel pressure
regulator and the decel valve.

Giff
