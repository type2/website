&gt;maintenance schedule.  Are there any tricks for keeping the bolts from
&gt;loosening?  Loc-tite?  JB Weld?  I'm curious what others do.


Neither likely to work, on 10+ buses and vans with axles in and out on each
countless times  I've only ever had one set get loose, and fortunately only
a couple bolts, those I probably stupidly left loose.  You'd never get the
threads clean enough for loctite but you shouldn't need it.  My rec, make
sure the bolts are in good shape, are correct grade (12.9's I think, that is
superior to grade 8, probably 150ksi or so bolts) either hex drive or triple
squares depending on your preference, but I note there that the triple
square usually have a self centering pointed tip, great to install but hurts
the amount of thread engagement by a thread or so.  Tightened properly (a
little above the spec is fine) and most importantly with the SERRATED face
lock washers in good condition, and the proper 2 bolt washer retainers, they
should never come out.  If they do, look for damage to the threads on the cv
flanges.  I usually give CV bolts a good tug with a standard craftsman 3/8
ratchet with either key, that is well in excess of whatever measly spec is
recced, not ridiculous, but a good solid tug.  With clean bolts and hex or
triple square key in good condition, I've never had a problem getting them
in or out again later.  I always double tigten as well, initially good and
snug in a criss cross fashion, then once around counting 6 bolts
sequentially with the solid tug.
