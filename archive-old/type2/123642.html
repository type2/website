Subject: HEAT?

In the 20+ years since I had my Beetle, I had forgotten about how bad 
the defrosters are in air-cooled VW's.  I will shortly be making my 
Westy a daily driver but not if I can't get some decent defrosting 
action!

The heat is there -- when I get the engine good and warm, two small 
spots form on the windscreen and slowly clear it, and the little 
squirrel-cage fan is phlegmatically boppin' away out back.

I have a small 12'volt oscillator fan I can use to move the air 
around, but is there any better way to boost the heat output to the 
front of the bus?  The vents are plenty hot, just no wind comes out 
of them.

I read something about a &quot;sump fan&quot; from one of our Australian list 
members.  Can anyone help shed some light on key terms I could use to 
go archive-hunting for the solution?  My wife won't ride in it if I 
use a propane heater....

Thanks,

BEN
