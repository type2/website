Subject: Location X3 Vacuum

I'm thinking of trying to check for vacuum leaks on my '79 bus and was 
following the thread from HoneyBus. I was wondering what exactly did he do with 
starting fluid? Was he spraying it around? Which throttle gasket did he permatex 
and how much stuff did he remove to get to it?  Thanks, Laura :o)
