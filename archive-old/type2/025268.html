I had experiance with this in the past. I had a new MSHP engine that did
just this. After much investigation and poking around (please note MSHP was
NO help, they are on my KMA list) I found the oil pressure relief valve
under the oil cooler to be incredibly built up with gunk and varnish. I
cleaned it out and had much better results. What I think happens, and this
is my own theory I would appreciate other opinions, is that the relief valve
does no seal completly giving the oil a path around the cooler and galley
where the pressure sending unit is. As the oil heats up and thins out more
will flow around the valve. This does two things one very bad. The first is
it gives erroneous oil pressure readings. On my engine I never heard the
death rattle of lifters going dry or any other indication of low pressure.
The second is oil is routing around the cooler and not sheding temperature.
This could be a bad cycle to be in. 

Bottom line check your relief valve.
