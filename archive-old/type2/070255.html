Everyone says &quot;a lot easier&quot;, but I'm wondering how it would even be &quot;possible&quot;
without a special tool.

I'm on a pretty depressing adventure still, and all I need to do to my bus 
is bleed the brakes.  The bleeder valve is broken off in the wheel cylinder,
way too deep to get it out.  The wheel is attached to the hub with a 46mm
nut, and nobody seems to sell a 46mm socket :-(  Except mail order, and harbor
freight just sent me a letter that said they could not fill my order...
NAPA told me they had a 1 13/16, but when I got to the store I found out
they lied.  Sears has a 3/4&quot; set that they sell for $200, which might be a 
good investment.

I don't really know what will happen once I get the nut off; I have a 3-arm 
screw-type puller, but it will push on the spindle, and I'm afraid that will 
just push the CV joint in, and not pull the brake drum off.

It's not that I mind this kind of work, it's just astonishing that I live in
a city with 2 million people and twice as many cars, yet nobody can sell me
a !_at_#$% 46mm socket.  Anyway, can anybody speak for the quality of the tool
sets from JC Whitney?  I would much rather get the $200.00 craftsman set than
find out that the $60 JC Whitney tools are bunk, even if it means ANOTHER
week that my bus is parked because I can't bleed the brakes.

In desperation, I tried to bleed the brake lines, starting from the rear
passenger, then did the rear driver by just unhooking the line and sort-of 
bleeding it, then the front passenger, then the front driver, but I was never 
able to get any pressure there, after a couple of hours of tries.

Man this is frustrating...
