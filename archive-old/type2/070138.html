I said, in response to an ellis/Rusty question:

&gt;&gt; is TWO, TWO, TWO pieces in one.  At least it is in my '67......

&gt;&gt; side (LHD).  So, the sadists at Westfalia probably did what you
&gt;&gt; propose...mirror image the cargo door side on the driver side.
&gt;&gt; No chemical application required.  The seam is not hidden.

And clara replied:

&gt; jim, your wood was replaced, it was a single piece from the
&gt; westfalia werks.

As clara posits, it may be a replacement (the reason I qualified
as &quot;At least it is...&quot;) I make no claims to be a guru, a mogul
maybe, but not a guru.  So, there really were sadists at
Westfalia!  Custom ording 6-foot sideways grain!

&gt; another pervert trinket - 67s used phillips head screws on the
&gt; westy wood panels (and on the deluxe trim strips and to hold the
&gt; jailbars on),  not slotted screws like the other years

I have the phillips head screws on my '67 Deluxe trim strips.  I
also had phillips screws on the '67 I parted out and on the '66 I
still have for parts.  All three of these deluxes have slotted
screws on the jail bars.  Knowing the PO of one of them, he
certainly did not change them.  He just watched it rust.

&gt; (like really, who cares?)

Oh, *somebody* must.  I don't see any any cause to get bent out
of shape here.  I like finding out all the little variations and
nuances.  It's like having a big crossword puzzle and filling in
the blanks, except the more we fill in, the more blanks appear.
I love a good mystery.
