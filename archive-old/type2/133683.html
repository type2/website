Subject: Extreme Exhaust Leak!

Hey Guys,

I finally got my '74 Micro running and now it has major exhaust leaks.  I
soaked the heater boxes in degreaser for about three months(!!) while I was
having the bus painted etc... Actually forgot about the poor things soaking in
a tuberware bin.
So I put a complete brand new muffler system and re-torqued the exhaust
manifolds (heater boxes) today.  The engine sounds like I'm standing with a
metal garbage can on my head while several mad people beat on it with
hammers!!
I tried to replace the copper seals between the heater boxes and the heads,
however they seem frozen in place.
I feel like crap, the bus is running terrible and I've had my head stuck in
the engine compartment for three weeks straight.  I guess I'm going to break
down and have the bus towed to a VW shop tomorrow.  I'm losing my Volkswagen
spirit now, it's been a real nightmare bringing this one back to life :-(

-Tom
