Subject: 1976 LT28 Bus???

Hi all;
   Perhaps one of you could give me some idea what a 1976 VW LT28 camper
is. There is one listed for sale in the local classifieds and I don't
have a clue what it is. It's described as being &quot;bigger than a Vanagon&quot;.
Really has me curious. Don't have time to go look at it right now, it's
50 miles away.
   Perhaps one of our European members has an answer?
