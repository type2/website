Hello list

I have a question about a 1973 dash for my bus. My
Dash board is padded of course, but the padded vinyl
cover is beyond repair. My question is, can I pull
this cover off and just prime and paint the metal
underneath? I have seen earlier model busses with
painted metal dash boards and i was wondering if the
late model bus dash boards were basically the same
except with a padded vinyl cover on it. has any one
tried this before? Thanks!
