Subject: returned emails

To the administators

Am having difficulty getting messages through.  Though I delete most  
of any email I respond to (only quoting 1 or 2 lines) I keep getting  
my emails returned because
&quot;Your mail to the type2 list has been intercepted and is
being returned to you because it appears to the list
server to contain an excessive amount of quoted material.&quot;

Any help appreciated.
