Subject: Gen light stays on -- goes out after engine revs

Hey all,

This has been happening after I put the new 1700 dual carb engine in my 72 
bus. After I start it, the gen light stays on. A slight rev of the engine and 
the light goes out...any ideas?

Also, the oil light doesn't come on at all (with the key in the run position 
-- engine off). Maybe the bulb is burned out. Does this light get its signal 
from the oil pressure sending unit?
