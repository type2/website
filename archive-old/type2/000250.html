I kept reading these messages and figured someone would have posted this
before me.

I had the same confusion when building a 2.0l vanagon motor. The Wilson book
talked of two pressure relief valves, one on the bottom, and the pressure
relief (control) valve between the number one pushrod tubes. The Bentley
spoke of two as well. HOWEVER, in the Muir, in the Changes and New Ideas
section (page 456), I found the following:

&quot;Page 90: Models after November, 1975 no longer have an oil pressure control
valve so don't look too long for it.&quot;

I know I looked a while for it before finding this in the Muir... those
Vanagon cases sure don't have it....  :)

&gt; &gt;I sure hope you're wrong about this!  I'm rebuilding 2 Vanagon engines
&gt; &gt;and I looked and looked and never found that second pressure
&gt; relief valve!
&gt;
&gt; My spare 79 block does not have the 2nd valve either.
