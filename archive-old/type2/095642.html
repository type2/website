&gt;The smog shops in California are supposed to see that all original smog equipment is in place and, in the case of the EGR, they're supposed to see that it's working....In my experience, some do this and some don't.

&gt;&gt; If I block off the system, does anyone know if the CA smog folks would notice?  (I've only smogged it once in CA, and I think I just got really lucky)
