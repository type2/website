&gt; So, I'm with you,....whasup with this??

dave,

i am not an auto engineer, but i'll take a stab.

i seem to remember you have a dual carb engine? do you have the stock
distributor with retard canister hooked up? timed at 5 ATDC? if the answers
to these questions are all yes, then we may have found the &quot;problem&quot;. the
stock dual carbs need retarded idle timing to make the central idle work
properly, and retarded timing will give low vacuum. as a test, you could
time the engine to 7 BTDC, with the retard removed and plugged, reset idle
to specs, then see where the vacuum is at. i am going to guess it may be
more like 15-17 inhg. but put it back to specs after the test.
