&gt;Anyone know of a source for these steel 15&quot; for
&gt;cheaper than gowesty?  I assume you have to use longer
&gt;lug nuts?

The lugnut info is in the web site library at either

www.vanagon_dot_com

or

www.type2_dot_com

The tech articles or library is where you need to go.

That will explain the lugnut requirements.

If you call (I gave up after mentioning VW and Transporter/Westfalia) tell 
them you need a 15&quot;x6&quot; steel wheel for a Mercedes with an offset closest to 
whatever the factory VW offset is (find this out first I THINK it is 35 mm 
but I would verify this first!).

Never mention VW or Transporter...

They only offer I think a 15&quot;x6.5&quot; wheel, or maybe a 15&quot;x7&quot; wheel for a 
Mercedes.

Tell them you are doing a Mercedes project and resurrecting an old one and 
using custom wheel sizes or something.

Late sixties Mercedes model with a fire breathing engine or something...
