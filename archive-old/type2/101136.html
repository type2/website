Subject: Re: [T2] I went and did it this time

Dave,

I have one of these also(68 DC) and got my front floor pans from
RMMW a couple of years ago.  They were made by Vinge...I think.

Alan Scofield in England has them also, but I think he gets them
from the same Danish source(some he makes himself).

The drivers side one was kinda funky and did not match the original
stampings very well, but looked as if it would fit ok...I only needed part 
of it and ended up cutting it so that it matched what i cut out pretty 
well.

The passenger side one is still awaiting installation.


From the RMMW web site

Cheers, dave

&gt; I had heard about this doublecab a couple years ago. 
&gt;  Legend of this truck wove it's way around and through the 
&gt; local bus community, surfacing like a porpoise, just to 
&gt; vanish again as legends do.  No one seemed to know where 
&gt; it was but 'everyone' knew 'someone' who had seen it 
&gt; recently but 'nobody' could pin it down.  Word was it was 
&gt; a bit rough, needing work but no one knew exactly what.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, you already figured out, I now own the 
&gt; legendary doublecab.  It's a 68 in dire need of floors and 
&gt; some rocker work and some brakes and an engine (maybe). 
&gt;  It still has the welding company stickers on the doors. 
&gt; I've got one and a source for more hoods to use for 
&gt; donormetal of the german variety so I need to find cargo 
&gt; floor and interrior floor sections.
&gt; 
&gt; Any of you metalmongers and weld splatterers know of 
&gt; doublecab floor sources?  Any and all leads appreciated. 
&gt;  Oh yeah pix available shortly at
