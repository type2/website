&gt; the pressure relief valve, which causes thick oil to bypass the oil cooler.
&gt;
&gt; Here it seemed to me VW engineers had designed in the thinning property of
&gt; single-weight oil as part of the overall engine design.  Using a multigrade
&gt; oil such as Mobil 1 15-50 or Castrol GTX 10-40 that does not appreciably
&gt; thin at higher temperature then defeats, in theory at least, the purpose of
&gt; the valve and cause the oil and engine to run hotter.

I've had the same thought, but the fact is that even multigrade oils lose
viscosity when hot so the viscosity/flow mechinism should still work.  In
fact, since the oil starts out thinner, it should flow through the cooler
easier which may or may not be such a good thing.

The way oils are graded, &quot;10W&quot; isn't the same thing as &quot;10&quot;.  The &quot;W&quot;
indicates that the viscosity was tested at low temperatures, but the cold
and hot tests are not directly comparable.  That's why you can have an oil
graded 20W20 that is different from a straight 20 oil.

The only way to test this would be to fill with 30W, run a route, then
fill with 10W40 and run the same route and note the difference in
temperatures.  You'd need to pick a time of day where the outside
temperature would be the same for both runs.
