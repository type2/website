Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap buses (was CHEEP BUSES)

One thing that always bugs me about &quot;cheap bus&quot; stories is this: 
imagine getting on a plane for a flight. You taxi down the taxiway and 
the pilot comes on the intercom and says:

&quot;Welcome aboard flight 2039 to Miami.

&quot;Looks like we'll have good weather for our flight today.

&quot;We got this plane for less than a million and haven't had to put any 
money into maintenance or repairs.&quot;

&quot;Enjoy the flight!&quot;

You gonna enjoy that flight?
