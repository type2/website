                      RE&gt;&gt; Re- Cutting out                         10/8/96

I got the following reply to my admonition not to disconnect the battery when
the engine is running, actually, I think Henry has said it rather well himself
and I would not presume to attempt to &quot;improve&quot; on it -- don't do this unless
all of you out there are ready to replace a whole bunch of electronic stuff,
ya know, like radios, cd players, electronic ignition modules, engine control
modules, or anything potentially [sorry, couldn't resist the puns    :-) ]
else that happens to be &quot;on&quot; and connected to the battery system at the time!


Apologies to Henry for publishing his private reply  w/o advance permission.

&gt;Disconnecting the battery while the engine is running(specifically 
&gt;while the alternator is alternatiing) is a VERY   unhealthy thing 
&gt;to do to your alternator - potentially fatal to the alternator. 
&gt;&quot;Kids - Do not attempt this in your car &quot;

Harvey, you and I know that without a reference voltage from the 
battery, the generator/alternator has no control. The overvoltage 
condition will burn out lights and accessories but the naive know 
only that &quot;motor still runs - 'can't be all that bad&quot;.  It would 
help if you could explain in simple terms, the result of the 
misdeed.
