Subject: Tranny bushings, linkages, adjustments?

 
--Dave, 

since I've got your attention, I've been rereading this post of yours the last few days, having bought the bushings and done the front of my 76 already...

There is a small round &quot;ring&quot; looking bushing at the front of the front rod.

--right, the front shift rod goes thru it (on later models only)

Next should be a rubber bellows that goes around the tube that the 
rear rod is supported in by the 3(yes 3!) plastic bushings inside the tube that support the rear rod.

--where is this bellows (mine is missing) in relation to the midpoint screw coupler? Also, the rear rod is a 'rod in a rod'? I thought the front and rear coupled together and went straight to the tranny?
