&gt;I'm really enjoying some of these threads! But they've got me thinking.
&gt;What all mod's  have ya'll done to increase HP/Performance of your
&gt;engines? Or are their any REALLY good ones for MPG?

More power with less fuel use would require total re-engineering at the 
very least. There are simply no bolt on mods that will improve either 
without giving up drivability or longevity.

&gt;  :) I've heard various
&gt;rumors, has anyone here actually tried any of these or know of any
&gt;others?

Lots and lots and lots have tried. None have empirical data to prove 
&quot;improvement&quot;, at least not without significant re-engineering.

&gt;Disconnect the Charcoal Canister from the intake.

Will do nothing for you as you then must reset mixture to spec.

&gt;Turn the Full Throttle Valve to always on or always off, I forget witch.

Expect big drop in MPG and problems with idle.

&gt;Disconnect the EGR valve so you don't re-burn gasses.

Difference will be virtually unmeasurable.

&gt;Install Full Flow/Unbaffled muffler.

Expect reduced flow through the heads without re-engineering cam/valve specs.

&gt;Install Electronic Ignition (i.e. pertronix)

Slight possible improvement but less reliable than stock.

&gt;I put split-fire plugs into my honda once. Made a big differance, do
&gt;they do much in VW engines?

Only time I ever saw split fires was when problems developed and cracked 
ceramics were noted. Big waste of money compared to good old Bosch Supers.

&gt;I've heard mixed reports on .009 distro's. What about Porche distro's
&gt;and/or OTHER Bosches?

.009 is dead wrong curve for T-IV engine. Nothing matches stock curve 
better than stock dizzy, without re-engineering. The Brazillian 050 is 
close, the Porsche 912 is close. ANY year T-II/T-IV original is closer to 
correct.

&gt;
&gt;Any other ideas/myths/theories/methods?

Cheapest method for significant increased power without serious loss of 
longevity. Install Porsche 912 engine. Result will be $6000 plus labor to 
re-engineer mounts and cooling tin seal, overstressed tranny.

Bottom line, stock specs throughout will give efficiency and longevity 
contemplated by a team of engineers that know perhaps 100 times more about 
vehicle design and function than this whole list put together.

All German engines typically are highly refined to be specifically suitable 
for intended purpose. How does Porsche take a 130 HP 911 engine and pump it 
up to 220 HP without losing longevity and reliability?? Re-engineer 
everything in the system from the air cleaner to the muffler and everything 
in between. A new 67 2.0 liter would run about $10,000. A new 3.0 RSR might 
cost $35,000.
