Subject: Jet-Hot coating and New Exhaust

With all the talk of painting or otherwise protecting your exhaust, I am
curious if anyone has ever had 'Jet-Hot' coating applied to any of their
components. A friend of mine used to race funny cars (and now has a '74
Westy, go figure) mentioned that it significantly cools the exhaust(probably
touch a hot exhaust with out burning yourself), or rather keeps the heat
moving out the tail piper rather than warming up the metal. This is a
cermaic metal coating, and can be used to improve flow. It also has the
ability to completely coat and protect far beyond that of paint, or chrome.

I was thinking that this would be good for at least the headers (keep
radiated heat away from the heads/pushrods/oil filter (Type4), etc. It also
may give you a few more degrees going into the heat exchangers.

I don't think I'd waste the money doing used parts, but if you are starting
anew, why not (cost issues aside)?
Website http://www.jet-hot_dot_com. The website says they can also do steering
and suspension parts. Interesting . . .

I'm interest in your opinions. Jack Raby? Anybody?
Thanks,
Chris Hammock
