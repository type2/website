I just tore down my engine; hope to have it back together by nightfall.

Here's the puzzle: the pistons and valves show signs of *both* too rich 
and too lean running. On the rich side, everything is coated with carbon. 
On the lean side, there is pitting on three pistons, and a serious melt 
spot on the edge of #4 (melted about a square inch of piston top, 1/2 
inch deep).

Anyone have any ideas? The EGR was not hooked up; valve was leaking. It 
should have be lean. How did I get carbon build-up?
