&gt; Well, alcohol still has a vapor pressure.  If the vapor pressure of
&gt; the alcohol at a particular temperature is less than the pressure of
&gt; the &quot;failsafe&quot; spring pressure divided by the thermostat area, then
&gt; the thermostat will remain closed.  If the pressure is the same, then
&gt; the thermostat opens.
&gt; 
&gt; Note that it takes a certain amount of energy to boil the alcohol into
&gt; vapor at constant temperature.  This is called the latent heat of
&gt; vaporization.  If the temperature of the thermostat is raised to the
&gt; boiling temperature and no additional heat is put in, the thermostat
&gt; will not open.  A bit more heat will open it up.  The same applies to
&gt; closing.  The thermostat will not close until a certain amount of heat
&gt; is removed from the open thermostat.
&gt; 
&gt; The heat of vaporization provides a hysteresis loop that should allow
&gt; for intermediate positions of the thermostat.  Since heat only flows
&gt; from hot things to cooler things, the opening outlet temperature has
&gt; to be a few degrees higher than the closing air outlet temperature. 
&gt; If the air runs a bit warm, the thermostat opens a bit.  If the air
&gt; cools off a bit then the thermostat closes a bit.

	[Crick, Bill [KAN:0W40-M:EXCH]]  Nice explaination George!
	Bretter than the mangled one I just posted.
	However note that the return spring follows Hook';s law, and its
force depends
	on position, so as the vapor  pressure (Partial pressure in my post)
	rises, with temp, it will find intermediate  and steady state
equilibrium points
	with the varying by position spring force.
	Thats my theory, and I'm sticking to it. It explains the steady
state half open thermostat 
	I and others have seen.
