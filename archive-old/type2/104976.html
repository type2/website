Subject: Re: [T2] Pep Boys/ Oil Dump

Your right about that David, it is a Federal law. So bring a bucket of waste
oil down to your local Foodfair or Market Basket store and watch the fun!

Subject: [T2] Pep Boys/ Oil Dump


&gt; Was Writ:
&gt; &quot;Another good thing about Pep Boys, last I heard, was that they'll let you
&gt; dump your used oil there.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; It is my understanding, and correct me if I am wrong, that any business
&gt; selling oil must also accept waste oil for recycling/disposal. I know that
&gt; my wholesale supplier does, as well as all the auto parts stores in the
&gt; area.
