Subject: The old Lorax

I just wanted to give the amazing outcome of this always funny story
about the Lorax. I found a vaccume leak. a thinner braided hose coming
off the AFM and such componants, connects to an elbow tube tha twas
completely busted out on the bottom side. I would have never found it
had i not dropped something and jiggled the hose.
So we will be at High Country 
I'm so stoked..it's the first bus event we get to go to. Big dent and
all I'll tell that story when I see ya's....
thanks for your continued help and love,
Monica and Lorax the 80 vang'n
