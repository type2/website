Subject: Upper cot

Thanks to Rob Henley for the free sink top for my 69
Westy! Much needed and much appreciated. So, as to
prevent the karma factory from going four paws north,
I would like to offer a freebie to the listees. I have
a perfectly lovely upper cot with tear-free, tan
canvas for 68-72's. As shipping is prohibitive on this
unit, the offer goes something like this:
If someone would like to pick it up, great! If nobody
needing the whole unit is close enough to pick it up,
I will ship just the canvas to the grand prize winner.
I am in York, Maine. Please p-mail. Thanks.

Doug
