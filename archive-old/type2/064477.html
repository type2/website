This leads back to the original question, how long SHOULD it take to 
depressurize when engine off, and what contribution would that have
to Jesse's problem and Rodney's query.

&gt; High-pressure fuel line is a concern, which is why I set my engine up

&gt; total of maybe a foot and a half of high pressure fuel line run in the
&gt; car (rather than 10 feet or more).  As to risk from leaks, if I get to
&gt; choose, I would rather have the leak show up when the engine is off (and
&gt; the fuel lines are still pressurized) than when the engine is running.

&gt;&gt; &gt;When I try to start the engine cold, it will not

&gt;&gt; &gt;has started, it runs just fine.  It does not do this when the engine is 
&gt;&gt; &gt;warm.  It is tuned up.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Or, what else could I look at?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I was recently contemplating this same problem, and I was thinking
&gt;&gt; about the fuel pump and/or fuel pressure regulator.  The main fuel
&gt;&gt; ring is supposed to stay pressurized while the car is off, right?
&gt;&gt; But presumably it would leak down over time (how long?  hours?  a
&gt;&gt; week?  a month?).  If the pump or pressure regulator is getting
&gt;&gt; weak, could that be a cause of long-cranking starts, i.e., takes
&gt;&gt; the fuel ring a while to get up to pressure?
