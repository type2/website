Subject: Carbureated '77?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

i'm helping a friend out with her 78 westy and her fuel injected engine was replaced at some point with an engine equiped with a Weber carb.  the number on the case matches her car while the hidden number is GE 035145, which i think is to a late '77.  My question for tune-up purposes is, is this possible, did VW make a carbureated 2000cc on a limited basis.  I heard they did by rumor, but i'd like to get some confirmation on that.  thanks a bunch, andy
