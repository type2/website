Mark and Volks,
   While I don't have any info on auto trannies, I do know that you don't 
have to change the gas tank in your 74 to run the fuel Injection.  A friend 
of mine who has a '78 with FI has an older, single outlet, gas tank 
installed.
   To make the older style tank work with the FI all he did was to put a tee 
fitting on a short piece of fuel line hooked to the tank outlet.   One side 
of the tee has a fuel line run to the fuel filter and electric fuel pump 
used by the FI.  The other side of the tee has the return fuel line from the 
pressure regulator.  All of the fuel hoses are of the high pressure variety. 
  And of course if you do this, while the tank is empty for replumbing, 
replace or clean the outlet sreen in the tank.
   This seems to work fine on the friends bus.  He just made a 7 week cross 
country trip with no problem.  Well none related to this anyway.
