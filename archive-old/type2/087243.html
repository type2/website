Subject: Re: [T2] stripes(found)


Well, got to thinking about it and went to the 3m automotive site....found 
exactly the right stuff.

All you Champagne edition folks now know where to find it.

Part number starts with 731-xx  where xx is the color.

2&quot;x 150feet....more colors than you can imagine.

Cheers, dave

&gt; stripes around the bottom of the  bus.  He says
&gt; that finding some that are as wide(about 2&quot;) as
&gt; what the stock ones are is going to be difficult.
&gt; 
&gt; Go to one of the small time guys who cuts stripes
&gt; and lettering for business vehicles.  It should
&gt; be cheap and easy.
