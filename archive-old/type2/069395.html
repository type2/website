Subject: red &amp;white split screen bus in movie

About 2 minutes Into the opening of 'Dirty  HArry' there is a red &amp; white
spit screen bus driving in San Francisco. It had lots of windows down the
sides but not the sunroof &amp; rear quater windows. I guess that it wold be
'seaing wax red'.

I did not watch more than this as I was trying to rewire my 70 westy.
