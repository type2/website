Subject: Engine tin Q's

Hello all!

As you may already know, the restoration on my '70
Westy is nearing completion and I have a few odds and
ends to attend to.

One such thing is the engine tin.  I just got it all
out of the box so I could prep it for paint and I
noticed that some of it isn't in the best of shape. 
My main concern is what I believe to be the rear cover
plate; though I'm not too sure about that.  It doesn't
look like any of the cover plates I see in my
cataloges at all (doesn't have round holes cut cut for
the fresh air ducts, though it does have a rather
ratty, rectangular hole cut out on one side).  I know
there were holes for the fresh air ducts, though there
doesn't seen to be any provisions for such on one side
and the only hole on the other is the rather ratty
looking one mentioned earlier.

Is this indeed the rear cover plate? (rear means back
of the bus closest to the engine door).  Is there some
other piece that is shaped similar to the rear cover
plate on a bus?  

I plan on replacing this one part becase it's in the
worst shape.  The cataloges sell them with the fresh
air duct cutouts, but without cutouts for the pre-heat
tubes.  Do I need to get one with the pre-heat cutouts
as well, and if so, is there anyplace that has one? 
This is on a '70 Westy with a dual port engine.

Thanks in advance!
