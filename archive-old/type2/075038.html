Subject: Re: [T2] Heating possiblities



&gt; I have enough trouble in winter getting my oil temp over 212 with the
&gt; stock system-which you need to get the corrosive water vapor driven 
out
&gt; of your oil.  In my high milage Westy, driving over 2 hrs at about 
60-65
&gt; mph gets it up to just around 212, with nice oil pressure of 30 (in
&gt; summer it's 240+ deg and 20 psi! Adding oil coolers doubling as heat
&gt; exchangers would make this concern worse!

Not if you use the &quot;heating&quot; exchanger in place of the stock engine-
mounted cooler.  In fact, you could bypass the cooler and get really 
hot oil!

I find it interesting that my type 1 doghouse engine allows full fan 
flow through the oil cooler at all times, as the flaps don't regulate 
cooler airflow.  My suspicion is that the viscosity of the oil in the 
cooler regulates the amount of cooling the oil gets, since excessive 
pressure will open the relief valve that bypasses the oil cooler.  
Bypassed oil does not get cooled.  Basically, it's a viscosity-
controlled oil cooling system.
