Subject: Vanagon Crew Cab

A friend of mine just got an '86 VW Crewcab transporter. They weren't sold 
here in the states as far as I know. He got it from a Marshall's seized 
property auction. They had hidden the drugs in the under bed storage 
compartment and then welded the doors up. They used bondo to smooth the 
areas then painted it. You'd never know. But the dogs smelled it and the 
drug cops eventually figured out where the doors where hidden and 
airhammered on of 'em off. Otherwise the transporter is in great condition. 
perfect intereior and great paint. He only paid $1900 for it and it runs 
great. I've got pictures if anyone is interested.

The reason why I'm posting is that I was amazed at how much room there is 
in the cab area of the truck. Especially the crew seat. So what years were 
these vanagon trucks in production? This was a watercooled one...but did 
they make aircooled ones? Even though we're down here in Texas and he 
bought it here, it was originally delivered to Canada. I've heard that's 
the place to look for one to bring to the states. Did they sell them in 
Mexico as well? I'm thinking one of these might be something I'd be 
interested in getting.

Any comments or experiences regarding these vehicles?
