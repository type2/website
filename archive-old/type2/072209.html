Subject: [T2] '71 1600DP intake manifold

&gt;On the carb-stand/intake manifold for a 1600DP, should there be a HOLE
&gt;connecting the heat riser tube pipe and the intake manifold pipe?
&gt;
&gt;I'm only asking because I am 99.9% sure that there IS a hole in my
&gt;manifold pipe that connects it to the heat riser tube, and I'm trying
&gt;to track down a vacuum leak and got to thinking that that hole shouldn't
&gt;ought to exist.  Unfortunately I didn't think to ask this question when
&gt;I first noticed the hole and while I still had the engine out...

my heat riser had a threaded hole in it. that's the way it came from the
previous owner. it was a california vehicle.  for cali emissions, a tube
was installed from the riser to the manifold. actually, there was a nifty
gadget that was placed between the carb and the manifold to recieve the
tube neatly. if yours spent time in california, the thing that comes to my
mind is emissions.  - steve
