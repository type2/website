Several folks have related stories of &quot;Herculean&quot; type efforts by various
models and configs of VW's.
I saw a type III Fastback towing the exact type of teardrop shaped trailer
to the '95 and '96 VW Classic. I have no idea what the engine config was for
that car but it looked ans sounded stock. I will be running a 1776cc with an
Engle 100 cam, large valves, and dual Dellorto 40's. It has a deep oil sump,
dog house cooler as well as an external filtering and cooling system. Heater
boxes have had flanges welded on to the ends that mate up to the 1 3/8&quot;
header to avoid the 10mm bs clamp loosening problem. Lastly, a hide away
turn-back muffler. The thing oughta rip! =) &lt;but that's not the intention of
the bus&gt; Gearing in the tranny is the 4.12 ring and pinion. We thought the
4.32 was too low and the 3.88 was too tall for climbing hills. I have the
3.88 in the single cab and like it a bunch but we wondered what the
difference in weight would do to the gearing while climbing hills. Both
trannies are '67 so I can always swap them out if I ever get totally bored.
&lt;not likely&gt;...

Someone did not know what a RFH trailer was. RFH refers to the '67 camper
bus. The trailer is a 1948 camp trailer that has a shape of a teardrop &lt;sort
of&gt;. It's size is approx. 5' height, slightly narrower than the splittie
buses and about 8' long plus the tow hitch A frame part. I am sure to at
least try towing the trailer as a test on flat ground to begin with. This is
of course all speculation that I ever complete the resto, config a proper
tow hitch, and finalize the trailer deal... I will dig into the archives
when time permits...
