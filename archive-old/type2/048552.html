Subject: [T2] Re: Heat exchangers

Just another 2c's worth, I used to hang a thick blanket behind the front
seats to divide the van when I was alone. This makes the H/E's job easier as
they only need to heat the cab, as for the rear view mirror, well the rear
window steams up &amp; unless you have rear de-mist it no use after a couple of
mins. If you need to see out the back, just drag the blanket across, sounds
basic but no more blue knuckles ;)
