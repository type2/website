&gt; I've noticed my 77 has brand new Uniroyal Laredo ASW rated as C tires. Are

I had a set of them and I wasn't pleased with the uneven wear.

Also, if they are 195/75R14, they are underrated for a bus at 1435 pounds
load rating where 1540 is the requirement.  This is better than passenger
tires, but iffy on a westy.
