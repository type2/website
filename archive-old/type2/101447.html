Subject: Re: [T2] Supplemental blower in 79' Westy not working

You might want to check the ground connection.  Mine wasn't working this 
morning and I found that the connector had corroded.

&gt; Does anyone happen to know if the supplemental blower in a 79' is on it's 
&gt; own circuit or what, if anything, shares the circuit with it? It's simply 
&gt; not working which means that my windows don't defrost, and I can't figure 
&gt; out what has happened. The inline fuse is fine, and the connections (+ and 
&gt; ground) both seem allright. Any ideas?
