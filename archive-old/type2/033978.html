Subject: Fuel neck '78 Westy

I bought one a year ago or so from RMMW.

Have a family member who works for the parts counter in a VW dealership 
here in TN and he could not get it from VW.

I'm talking about the 90 degree bend at the top of the filler neck just 
inside the gas cap - It's made of rubber.

No one seems to have one. Mine is fine but I would like to buy a couple of 
spares before I can't get one for real.

What type of filler neck does the Mexi-busses or the Brazilian busses have? 
Same style?

Not urgent. Check yours, mine was in very poor condition. So was the 
connection at the gas tank. I was smelling gas on curvy roads. It was 
scary! I don't know why I didn't just burn up!

If you want to hear more, I have a tirade I'll send you. This is really 
important folks! If you haven't checked yours do it right away. It's 
amazing what they are putting into gas these days and what it does to 
rubber fuel system parts..

Merry Christmas!
