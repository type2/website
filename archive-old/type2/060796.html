  I have looked everywhere, and just don't know what kind of bus I have.  It's
a 1979 camper conversion, but instead of a pop top, it has a sliding steel
sunroof.  It has a sink with the pump faucet, an icebox, and next to the back
seat which pulls out into a bed, a row of cup holders which house a storage
area underneath.  There's cabinet space above the back seat.  According to VW
of America, the exterior color was hot chili red metallic when it left the
factory.  I don't even know what that looks like.  It's orange now, and the
interior body panels are that color as well  It's getting ready to be painted,
and in the process of doing that, stripes were discovered, not unlike those on
the Champagne Edition (starting at the footwells of the door, and moving up
and back).  I'd like to keep it original, but I don't know what camper
conversion company converted this bus, and I don't know what paint scheme it
could've had on it.  Anybody have any ideas?
