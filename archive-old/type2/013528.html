Subject: Solar power/ energy fair in Wisconsin
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com, type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello all,
In the past there has been occassional discussion
about solar power, etc., for buses, especially when
camping. If you are interested in learning more about
&quot;alternative energy&quot;, the best Energy Fair in the
country is coming up this week, at the county
fairgrounds at Amherst, WI, just east of Stevens
Point, Wisconsin, in the central part of the state. It
starts Friday June 22, and continues through Sunday
June 24.  Ther is a web site at
http://www.the-mrea_dot_org/ with more info. 
This is one of the best places in the world to see,
buy or learn about photovoltaic panels (solar
electricity), batteries, wind generators, invertors,
electric vehicles, etc.,  etc.
In past years I have noticed quite a few VW buses and
campers at the grounds, and we will be there in our
1975 bus, orange and white.  The 65 double cab gets to
stay home this year.
Hope to see some VW bus folks there.

Jim (in WIS)
