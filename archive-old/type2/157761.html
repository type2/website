  Chai, 

One other possibility that might cause your symptoms-- I once had a
'71 Super Beetle that I was using for a 40 mile 1-way commute. I would
set the points, but after a week or ~200 miles, it would start to miss
badly, &amp; I'd find the points almost closed.

Turned out the hole for the point adjusting screw in the points plate
was stripped (probably by me). A local mechanic with a set of small,
fine metric taps was able to get me back on the road, but I still had
problems, &amp; eventually had to replace that distributor.

Learned the hard way not to over-torque that screw.

Just something else to check.

Hope this helps,
