&gt; Okay, I'm having a senior moment and that's the best description I could
&gt; come up with for what I'm seeing here:

&gt; I SO like the look of these headlight thingies.  Anyone know:
&gt;
&gt; Is the sticky-outy part separate or part of the headlight ring?

I've seen them both ways.  some are part of the ring, some just clamp
underneath.

&gt; What they were stock on, or were they?

They've been around for years.  Probably started in the 50s or earlier.
They became popular with the lowrider homeboys and seem to have crossed
over to the VW crowd.  I don't think that any vehicles came stock with
them.

They tend to draw the attention of law enforcement.  Be warned.

&gt; Where I can get some!!!

Just about any VW chrome provider.
