Subject: Re:78 Bay Drum Brake Q?

David,

	I just read your post on the type 2 list and believe you have a
problem some place from the middle to the top of your brake assembly.  Two
things lead me to say that.  First, you know the star adjusters are working
properly and that's at the bottom.  Second, you know the hydraulic portion
of your system is not normal, requires too much pedal for not enough
braking, and that's at the top.  My best guess would be that you have the E
brake lever or the cross bar installed improperly allowing the top of the
shoes to pull in, retract, too much.  That would require that they have to
travel out farther than usual to rub on the drum when you press the pedal.
And to get them to make that extra travel would require extra travel of the
brake pedal and your foot.  And of course when you pull on the E brake that
spreads the top of the shoes closer to the drum so not as much travel is
required and better braking is experienced.
	There doesn't seem to be a great picture of rear drum brakes in the
Bentely manual.  For 71 and later rear brakes see the picture on page 23 of
chapter 8 in the Bentely manual.
