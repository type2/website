&gt; Somewhere/somehow there must be a way to [legally] obtain one of these
&gt; engines.  If anyone on the List knows of a source I hope they post the
&gt; necessary information.....

well one way is to drive to Mexico and have the van &quot;Repaired&quot; by having
a new engine installed.  Then just drive home....

it does work.  ask me how I know?!?!
