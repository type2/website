Subject: smokey exhaust

I posted about this previously, but it seems to be getting worse.  At 
startup I have ALOT of smoke when I give it gas.  it stops when the van is 
warmed up.  The smoke is white/light blue.

A couple of replies said that it was nothing, just condensation and not to 
worry about it unless it happens after it is warmed up. None of my other 
volkeswagens do this though.

So:

Should I assume I will be needing a 'top end' rebuild cuz my seals are bad?

Can the rebuild wait until it keeps smoking AFTER its warmed up?

I need to do a compression test i'd assume.  I lost the step by step 
directions another listee sent to me prior.  Can someone direct me to the 
steps for a compression test in the library?

Also what kind of compression tester should I buy?

What does a top end rebuild consist of anyway?

Thanks a ton!

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
