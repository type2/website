hi,
it shouldn't be too hard to find tranny parts.
check out  www.busdepot_dot_com , i'm sure they can help. as far as the 2.0 vanagon engine engine into a '73, i would say yes,
because they are both type 4 pancakes, but, you would have to be careful about the cooling tin.
good luck-
shane
'80 vanagon l

&gt; Hello!!! I am new to this list, and I just had a question. I am fortunate enough to have &quot;adopted&quot; a 1973 bus, about a month ago. It is automatic. The tranny is shifting great, (original) but if someday I would have problems with it, is it hard to find parts for the automatic tranny?? In most catalogs, they only advertise for the stick shifts. My other question is, can I drop a 2.0 Vanagon aircooled engine into the 1973?? Would I have to use larger carbs?? It still has the original Solexes.
&gt; Thanks for your help.
