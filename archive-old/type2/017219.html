    Be careful with these -- I put one in a Type 1 engine and trashed a
new rebuild -- turns out that the magnetic part was too long, it pushed
the strainer plate right up tight against the mouth of the oil pickup
tube, and since I hadn't hooked up the wire from the oil pressure sender
in my haste to hear the new engine run, it trashed the bearings very,
very quickly.
