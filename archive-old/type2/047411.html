&gt; Thanks Jim,
&gt; 
&gt; Just called the Time Fastener Co &amp; ordered the Timesert kit # 0127 for
&gt; repairing the tapered thread *for the oil sender* on the side of the case.
&gt; I spoke with John * the owner* .  He knew exactly what was needed to make
&gt; the repair.  Now it will be a permanent fix instead of trying to put
&gt; something on the threads to keep it from leaking.....

Now this is great!  I hadn't heard of a fix for the sender hole short of
welding it up and redrilling!  Putting a pipe thread in a magnesium case
isn't the brightest thing VW has ever done!

How is the insert itself sealed?  Is it a tapered thread, or is there some
sort of seat or sealant involved?  As I recall, Timeserts have little
drive-in pins that lock the insert, but they don't seem to be designed
with sealing in mind!
