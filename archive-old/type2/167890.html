Subject: Re: [T2] please help with coil?

Hi, I would like to thank everybody that replied. I will be able to 
sleep much better now. You guys all ROCK!
What an awesome resource this list is!
Also I had no idea you could figure out the dwell with the volts! Blows 
my mind.
Bernie,
Fort Langley, B.C.

&gt; Oops. I worked that backwards - you're set to about 42 degrees of 
&gt; dwell, so your point gap is slightly too big. That should not cause 
&gt; the points to burn, though.
&gt;
&gt; To figure dwell with a voltmeter, measure as you did, then divide 
&gt; (7.3/13.6 = .54 percent), for a 4 cylinder engine multiply by 90 
&gt; degrees (.54*90 = 48 degrees), that gives you the &quot;anti-dwell&quot; (i.e. 
&gt; how long the points are open). Subtract from 90 to get the dwell angle 
&gt; (90-48 = 42 degrees).
&gt;
&gt; This works pretty well as long as the meter shows a stable reading 
&gt; when the engine is running (which indicates the meter is averaging the 
&gt; voltage well). If the numbers bounce around, it will be less accurate.
