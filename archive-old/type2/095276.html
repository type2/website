Subject: Re: [T2] doophed up friday question


I thought only 40 horse motors used the spring and flared tube.

&gt;
&gt;Dont know if it was the same on type two versions but on my type one 
&gt;engines there was a spring between the shroud and the carb. I believe there 
&gt;was another tube also.  I modified mine so the tube stayed in.  flared the 
&gt;other end slightly and put a clip on it.
