&gt; &gt; Many of you may not be aware, but in North America you have a better chance
&gt; &gt; of finding a split window Single or Double Cab then finding a 72-79 SC or
&gt; &gt; DC. The 72-79 pick-ups were never brought into North America, due to
&gt; &gt; regulatory reasons. So where is the best place to search for one? Mexico,
&gt; &gt; UK, etc...
&gt;
&gt; They're still rarer than panel vans or Kombis by at least an order
&gt; of magniture, though.
&gt;
&gt; Note however that through '79, German pickups all had the 1600 cc,
&gt; 50 bhp Type 1 engine.  Type-4-engined pickups were available abroad
&gt; (like e.g. the Netherlands), but never in Germany.

interesting that the type 4 engine wasn't avaliable where it was made.

in any case might try central America, when I was last in Nicagagua they
were dern near everywhere, now finding one in good condition was another
story seems a lot of the ones I saw were hauling bags of cement, lots of
cement piled higher than the cab...
