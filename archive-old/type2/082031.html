Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Cap

Hey Chris,
I had to put 2 gaskets on my gas cap to make sure it sealed. My filler neck
had worn so much I couldn't get a tight seal. I posted about 2 years ago
when this happened that I actually spun the DC out on a slow left hand turn
where the gas spilled out onto my right rear tire causing a severe loss of
traction. The only fix for me was 2 gaskets on the stock cap.
