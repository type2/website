Great idea. Do you know if this is the same relay that fits a '70? My
problem is twofold:
lights are stuck on bright, and my horn honks when I hit the dimmer switch.
One problem is a broken connection in the turn signal/dimmer switch unit
mounted on the steering column. I have tried to solder the thing repeatedly,
but the connections are so close and the wires so tight in there it just
keeps breaking. Bonus question: are these switches replaceable?

&gt;
&gt; Next problem:  The 4-pin 411-941-583C relay is no longer available (at
&gt; least locally)  Web searches revealed only one source, a Porsche supplier.
&gt;
&gt; Luckily, I have a fairly savvy parts guy and he pulled out a 111-941-583
&gt; 5-pin relay to compare.  The extra pin (#30) is supposed to be attached to
&gt; a hot wire to energize the relay coil.  In the old relay the coil  was
&gt; attached internally to pin 56 which
&gt; is the voltage source supplied from the headlight switch.
