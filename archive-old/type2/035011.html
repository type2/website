&lt;&lt; While you have the panel off, it's a good idea to give
 the inside of the door a good coating of rustproofer - I use Waxoyl, you may
 be able to get it or something similar.  Give the wheel arch the same
 treatment - there is a hole in the top next to the seat that you can spray
 the stuff through until it runs out of the drain hole in the bottom.

I'm going to rustproof my recently acquired '78 Westfalia soon.  I've been 
unable to locate a suitable rustproofing gun (as opposed to undercoating).
Back when I was an automotive painter in a pretty big shop we had a quart 
size rustproofing gun that had interchangeable tips- one that was small with 
a 45 degree bend, one that sprayed in a fan pattern, and another with a long 
flexible hose and a tip that sprayed 360 degrees.
I've been unable to locate a gun like this anywhere.  The closest I've seen 
is in the Eastwood catalog, and it is not the same.  Does anyone out there 
know where I could get a good rustproofing gun?  Does anyone have an Eastwood 
gun and really like it?  I've lost contact with my Mac and Snap on 
distributors, so does anyone know if they have a good rustproofing gun?
Thanks for the help.
