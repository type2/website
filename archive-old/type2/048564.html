Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Windshield sizes

&gt;Hello everybody, I was at a local junkyard today.
&gt;Now I have a 68 westy and I was
&gt;wondering if a windshield from a newer bus will fit with no problems.

'68 till '79 ('00 if they are still doing the bay in South America)
all the same.  But all glass isn't equal and all don't fit the
same.
