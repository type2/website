Subject: Re: bus security (paranoids exposed)

I'm a security paranoid too (and a gadget freak). Normal alarm, separate
imobilisor + alarm, dummy flashing LEDs, steering locks, Tracker....

But while I'm waiting to find a locking engine lid catch this is what
I've done...

Went in Radio Shack / Tandy (or anywhere that sells burgler alarm stuff)
and purchased two normaly open read switches, fixed one up for the engine
lid and one for the tailgate. When either open then a small light comes 
on in the engine compartment and another in the cargo area - this will
set off my voltage sensing alarm.

              -------read switch------------light-----earth
              |                      | 
 +ve supply---|                      |
              |                      |
              -------read switch------------light-----earth

The light inside can be seen in my rear view mirror and tells me if I 
drive off with the engine lid open after fixing something.
The light in the engine compartment is sufficient to do minor emergency
road side checks/repairs at night.

I also used another of the above read switches to turn the cab courtesy
light on when the sliding door opens, again this sets of the voltage
sensing alarm.


On a slightly different thread.
A forth read switch was used with an ignignition controlled supply to
sound a buzzer if I try to drive off with the pop-top up.

(Gee, I must keep Radio Shack going on my own!)
