X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

Had this problem with every VW I ever owned at one time or another.  The
villain is time.  Over time all those connections corrode and there are a
few.  Also, the ignition switch gets real hot when you are in the cranking
mode, especially when the cranking time is longer than a few seconds.  So
let's look at the picture from a few feet back and I will paint you my
solution.  Engine in rear of vehicle, battery in rear of vehicle, switch in
front of vehicle, 37 feet of wire running from back to front and back again,
numerous connections along the way and a steel chassis that has to carry the
ground (return path).  I ran a new ground cable directly to the starter
stud, lower, and the pig tail coming off the new ground terminal at the
battery got connected to the chassis.  I then installed a heavy duty push
button switch in the hole meant for the timer of an auxiliary heater and
by-passed the ignition switch.  If you run you hand behind the dash where
the light switch and rear window defroster switch are, you will feel these
holes in the steel so you just have to poke a hole through the plastic and
ream to fit the switch shaft.  Works great and when you stall the engine for
whatever reason, you simply push the button and away you go!

                                                                    --------

&gt; Again, my '78 got caught in a parking lot, and would not kick over when I
&gt; turned the ignition key on.
&gt;
&gt; I had this problem last year, now I have it again.
&gt;
&gt; I do have a Ford solenoid switch at my starter solenoid, so I was really
&gt; surprised to see this 'hot start' problem today, in 35 degree weather
(USA).
&gt;
&gt; My theory is that my wires are corroded, and when I hit the solenoid, I am
&gt; actually jostling the wires just enough to get back the extra amps of
&gt; current to get the starter solenoid to react.
&gt;
&gt; The problem is in the corroded wire(s) and connections, not the starter
&gt; solenoid.
&gt;
&gt; (And the world is not really round, but it is made up of many, many flat
&gt; spaces, like my back yard and yours...)
&gt;
&gt; (And if you go far enough and fast enough, you will actually fall off the
&gt; edge, but you will find another flat space just before you go careening
off
&gt; into space...)
&gt;
&gt; (And I wonder why it is that no one visits me??  )
