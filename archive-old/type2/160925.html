Subject: Re: [T2] Engine tins for a PO's engine swap

To be honest, I don't have it in my possession yet, so I can't check. I
won't pick it up until tomorrow. Judging from the fit of the parts, it
wouldn't surprise me that it is missing. If so, I will add it to my parts
list. I guess the first thing I will need to do is pull the engine and fix
all the little stuff that may cause problems later on. Thanks to all on the
list for all the heads ups on stuff that I am not experienced enough to
notice.

Ron

&gt; Hi Ron,
&gt;
&gt; While thinking about some other engine swaps I remembered something
&gt; that hasn't been mentioned in regards to your engine... How is it
&gt; held in place???
&gt;
&gt; If it's only bolted to the transmission you are putting undue stress
&gt; on the two bolts that hold the tranny subframe to the bus. There
&gt; should be a &quot;mustache bar&quot; across the back of the engine bay
&gt; supporting the engine from the frame of the bus.
&gt;
&gt; Happy trails,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; I have just purchased a '78 bus that has had the FI powerplant
&gt; &gt; swapped for a
&gt; &gt; 1600 Dual port. It looks pretty good, but as you can see from the
&gt; &gt; attached
&gt; &gt; photo, the engine tins are not fitted properly
