Subject: Re: R: [T2] R: [T2] Temp Gauge

&gt;Well, I think it's cool enough if I have my Oil Temp in 0F other than
&gt;Celsius... in this list everybody talks Farenheit anyway!!!
&gt;
&gt;As for the head temp the same, for the RPMs it just doesn't apply, no?

Yep temps and pressures are metric or standard. RPM are the same either way
because not such thing (YET) as metric time...

If I had my way I'd have all metric instruments. Lots of fun to see a
passenger's eyes widen when they spot the speedo pointing at 100. When I
was living in Napoli I went to Roma to retrieve my parents who came for a
visit. My mother in the backseat of my '72 40 HP Maggiolino (Super Beetle)
spotted the speedo pointing at 110 and went nuts telling me to slow down
before I got us killed. I pointed out that the taxis were passing us and
that it was really only about 70 mph.

She got suspicious a few days later when I was running 165 kph in my
friend's turbo diesel Peugeot.
