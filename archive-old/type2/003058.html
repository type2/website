The 009 only advances 20 degrees compared to the stock 40 degrees.
Therefore 20 degrees btdc would give you the same full advance.  There are
definite disadvantages to starting out at 20 degrees btdc like slow
cranking, rougher idle, noisier engine, and possible denotation. So choose
what works best for you.

Hey Folks,

What is the proper timing for a 009 in a 72.  I did have it set at 5atdc
and just changed it to 5btdc. Somebody please fill me in.

Thanks
