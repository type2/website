Subject: Fuel bulkhead fittings

Anyone know where I can find a bulkhead fitting to pass through
5/16/7.5mm fuel injection line through the engine tin or body/firewall,
similar to the AN style aeroquip fittings? 
My electric fuel pump has 5/16 barbed outlet, and doesn't have npt or AN
available. So I am stuck with 5/16/7.5mm german hose that I need barbed
fittings or some method of coversion to AN or whatever.

What I am looking for is a solid fitting to replace the rubber
grommet/brake line/fuel hose trick we all have to do for a secure fuel
set and reduced fire risks.

Thanks,
Al
