Subject: Re: [T2] Generator has rough spot - fix or replace?

The generator has brushes that indeed rub gently against the commutator.
Is this the rubbing you are referring to?

If you remove the brushes and something is still rubbing, then you need to
replace the bearings or perhaps just get a rebuilt generator.
