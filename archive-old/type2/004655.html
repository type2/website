Perfectionism is hard with a VW, and finding someone with the characteristic
is the same..

My shop is the same way, we are not the cheapest, but not many do a better
job...

&gt; Just remember, you get what you pay for.  If a customer wanted to
&gt; bargain my shop rates, I'd be 'forced' to cut corners. If you don't like
&gt; the man's price, go somewhere else.

&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; Does anyone out there, have an old flat rate manual for mechanical shop
&gt; &gt; times?
&gt; &gt; I am negotiating with VW for the price to get my valves done.
&gt; &gt; They are claiming 10 hours to R&amp;R the engine, plus the price of R&amp;Ring
&gt; &gt; the heads, plus the price of the valve job, plus, plus, plus.
&gt; &gt; I'm telling them it should take no more than 8 hours to remove and
&gt; &gt; replace the engine and heads, especially since the guy doing it is a
&gt; &gt; Deutschlander, who has done it more than once in his life, the only
&gt; &gt; problem is he is a perfectionist, and is quoting big times to cover is
&gt; &gt; dupa.
