Subject: [T2] BURNING EXCESS OIL, SCRAPER RING?

I NOTICED THE 71' WHITE WHALE IS BURNING EXTRA OIL LATETY AND IT STARTED 
SMOKING AT STARTUP.  CAN THIS BE A SCRAPER RING? AND CAN I CHANGE OUT THAT 
SET IN THE #2 WITHOUT REBUILDING THE WHOLE MOTOR?
I STARTED FOULING PLUGS.
MY GUESS IS THAT THE SCRAPER RING IS NOT DOING ITS JOB AND EXCESS OIL IS 
BEING BURNT AFTER SITTING?
AM I CLOSE?

THANKS IN ADVANCE,
MIKE
ALBUQUERQUE NM
