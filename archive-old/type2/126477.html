Subject: Re: [T2] Tin foiled

If you're not going to be using the holes for the heater tubes,
there's a way to block them off without doing any permanent damage to
the tin...

I got aluminum flashing material (leftover from some roof work at the
inlaws), cut it to about 2&quot; larger than the holes, slobbed on some
hi-temp silicone, and placed them over the holes. This way they're
sealed up, but I can remove the aluminum whenever I get new HEs and
want to hook the heaters back up. All I have to do is scrape off the
silicone.

BTW: This method can be used to repair rusty spots too to keep you on
the road until you're ready to drop the engine to get at those
pieces...
