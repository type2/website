Hello all,
This list is for Bus content only.  Please do not post hoaxes or warnings
about hoaxes.

If you ever have any questions about whether something like this should be
posted, please contact an admin at type2-admin_at_type2_dot_com.

If you think that your virus warning/cookie recipe/hoax warning/great social
cause is so important that the Bus content only rule shouldn't apply to you,
then DO NOT POST IT!!  By definition, it is crap and doesn't belong on the
list.  As a general rule of the Internet, if anything comes to you in the
form of mass e-mail, it is probably untrue.

Just as a note, as mentioned in the list charter, anyone who does post virus
warnings or other such chain letters will be removed and permanently banned
from the list with no apologies or guilt from the admins.  All the rules are
in the charter, and literacy is a requirement for list membership.

Thank you all for your anticipated cooperation.

When someone asks you if you're a god, you say YES!


&gt; Gentlepersons-
&gt;                       First off, the NCID (Nat'l Center for Infectious
&gt; Diseases), has stated that
&gt; this is a hoax traveling the net: Just got three separate emailings about
the
&gt; &quot;Klingerman
&gt; Foundation Virus&quot; arriving in ordinary mail boxes...Don't know how or why
I
&gt; got it but if
&gt; others get it, don't pass it on...I repeat, it's a hoax.
