&gt; Fuel filter or fuel pump, I agree, and something strange I ran into a few
years back -  O2 sensor.  My '77 Westy would go for longer though.  Maybe
30-40 miles and then just act like it ran smack out of fuel.  After a little
cool-down it would go again. Sensor fixed it.  Rob

O2 sensor on a 77?!?!?    Huh?
O2 sensors started on 79 buses in California.

Perhaps you mean the cylinder head temp sensor?
