Subject: Re: [T2] Marvel Mystery Oil (was oil additive advise)

Michael,

Friday content on....uhhh what day is? this?

I shudder at the carcinogenic part too, except I have stayed at
a very nice hotel in California with this notice posted everywhere.

I think this is pretty close to what it said.

&quot;Certain cleansers(chemicals) used for cleaning(at this hotel)
are known to the state of California to cause cancer.&quot;

Sunshine causes cancer, steak causes cancer.

I intend to *live* until I die&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I have a very accurate sense of smell, and am sure I noticed that MMO
&gt; smells just like the oil used for lubing air tools (jack oil?) and they
&gt; smell exactly alike, with the same reddish color!  I'm sure kerosene is
&gt; in there......maybe some xylene, as that is a common solvent for cutting
&gt; contamination.  As an ex biologist/histologist, I shudder at the
&gt; tolulene, benzene, xylene, and acetone I've handled, much of it
&gt; carcinogenic.

&gt; &gt; MMO is really just a solvent mixed with oil.  The solvent can be good for
&gt; &gt; things like stuck lifters, but you have to balance that with its possible
&gt; &gt; negative effects on other parts of an engine.  It will loosen sludge from
&gt; &gt; engine surfaces just as well as it cleans it from the lifters, so unless
&gt; &gt; you change the oil filter promptly it can cause big problems.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don't know why MMO has escaped &quot;snake oil&quot; reputation, but for some
&gt; &gt; reason it is now a mainstream product.  It has a purpose, but it isn't
&gt; &gt; magic by any means!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Seems like paint thinner was $2 a gallon last I bought some at Home Depot. Should
&gt; &gt; &gt; I add a pint sortly before changing my oil? (gotta get my 40w out any day now!)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not sure what is in it but I was introduced to Marvel Mystery Oil in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1965. Since this product is still in business they gotta be doing something
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; correct.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I found the MSDS for Marvel Mystery Oil. MMO contains:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * at least 35 percent &quot;heavy solvent-refined mineral oil&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * at least 35 percent &quot;heavy solvent-dewaxed mineral oil&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * and no more than 30 percent Stoddard Solvent (mineral spirits)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's all they listed. Motor oil with parts cleaner in it. Helluva concept,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and one that works extremely well.
