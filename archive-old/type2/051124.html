&gt; My wife gets pretty cold camping also.  How much power

I don't know about cost, but be sure that you have a separate battery to
run it from.  It's a bummer to wake on a frosty morning to a dead battery.

  Who
&gt; is RMMW, and how good is their stuff?  Thanks.

OK outfit, but their prices are quite steep.  Some items are 2X the price
of other suppliers.  You pay for those slick catalogs!  Something like
this blanket might be had cheaper at an RV store.
