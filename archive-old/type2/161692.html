Subject: RE: [T2] Fwd: VW Wheel Balance Adapter - $50

&gt;Hopefully this will answer your questions.
One bolts a tire onto this plate and then this plate gets attached to the
&gt;balance machine? Is it for sure that the plate will fit most machines? &quot;*
&gt;
&gt;That's exactly how it works
&gt;
&gt;The center hole is 90mm (3.54&quot;). Thats the same diameter of the later 4 lug
&gt;rims. The plate is 280mm in diameter (11&quot;) and weight 2lbs 6ozs. The bolt
&gt;pattern is the same as the early VW, 5x205.

OK, i do this (tire balancing) for part of my living (full time firefighter, 
part time mechanic, tire balancer extrodinaire)

Without having one in my posession, I am almost dead certain that the hole 
will fit one of the adapters on a computer balancer.

&gt;
&gt;That's right, both are the same bolt pattern.

the diffrence is in the size of the bolts going thru the hole.  If he 
drilled it to the larger size it would wobble or get off center for the Bug 
rim.  I'm so sure it will work that as a professional tire balancer I would 
order some for myself if I hadn't found ours this afternoon.

I have no affiliation with the adapter dude. recieve no kickbacks, or profit 
in any way from the sales of said adapters.
&quot;I dont want to buy anything.  I dont want to sell anything.  I dont want to 
process anything.  I dont want to buy or sell anything prosessed.  I dont 
want to process anything bought or sold.  I dont want to buy anything 
prosessed or sold.  I dont want to sell anything processed or bought.  I 
just want to date your daughter.&quot;
