&gt; I just purchased some Solex 34mm Dual Carbs from CBPerformance and they

Are these to be mounted on a type1 engine or the type4? Chris is the
only person I have known to have bought their type4 kit and IMHO it
was simply an afterthought with pieces that didn't quite fit
correctly. In addition to the actual defect he had in one of the
carbs.

I happen to have the set on my upright engine and love them. No
problems to speak of. I do consider the linkage kit to be quite poor,
and in fact mine was out of spec (as I found out later while looking
at Chris'). My recomendation is to not even try to get that crappy
linkage working and purchase a scat universal linkage. It works great,
although you do need to do some modifications to make it work
correctly with carbs that the butterfly opens opposite directions like
the solex.

Oh, also CBPerf has to have some of the worst customer service I have
ever seen. Many of my emails went unanswered and the ones that were
answered might as well have gone unanswered.
