Subject: [T2] Re:Convert Gasoline to Natural Gas?

I had a lovely private reply to this ..

&gt;LOOPS:
Open Loop: there is no oxygen sensor.
Closed Loop: there is an oxygen sensor. &lt;

Absolutely .. and both of these are legal in europe ..

What isn't legal (For road use) are open vapoursiation units .. Basically
those that operate like a gas ring .. IE the tank gets cold .. as they are
running ...

However I still have to giggle every time I think of frozen propane bottles,
there was Laurel and Hardy type scene in Aldwich a few years ago involving a
gas bottle a gass ring and a couple guy on a tea break ..
