&gt;&gt; Under normal circumstances if everything is off you should have

&gt;&gt; safer to make your ground connection away from the battery...won't
&gt;&gt; spark and/or ignite hydrogen fumes which may be around battery.
&gt;&gt;  

&gt; unfortunately, if you do that, you will blow the fuse in your meter.
&gt; When checking resistance you must be disconnected from the power
&gt; suply. And if you have a cheap meter, it might not have a fuse,
&gt; you'll just need a new meter.

Hmmm, hadn't considered that....the meter becomes the short.
I knew I wasn't feeling so 'on the ball' today.
Guess if I'd done it the shock would have woken me up.
....never mind.

Hi Jeff

&gt; Here's the deal as I remember it:
&gt;     If you remove the battery cable from either terminal of the battery
&gt; and connect one lead of the volt meter to the battery (where you
&gt; took the cable off) and the other lead to the disconnected battery
&gt; cable, the voltage reading should theoretically be 0 . A reading of
&gt; 12 volts will typically indicate a short. Once this test has shown
&gt; that a short may exist, my next step is usually to remove one fuse
&gt; at a time and see if any single fuse makes the volt meter read zero.
&gt; If I find that one fuse makes the volt meter drop to zero, I know
&gt; that the problem is in the circuit that the removed fuse was
&gt; protecting. Hope this helps. P.S. Depending on which cable you
&gt; remove and which lead of the volt meter you connect to the
&gt; battery/cable, the polarity of your reading will change. Not a big
&gt; deal for digital volt meters but with an analog meter this may be a
&gt; problem.
&gt;  -Jeff

much better plan.
