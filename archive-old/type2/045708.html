Subject: [T2] Rebuilt Motors 

Thanks to the masses on the Mark Stephens issue. I have been out of the loop
for a while. What is the latest info on the best motors available? I assume
AVP is still in business? I recall hearing good things about them but then
again I recall hearing good things about Mark Stephens too.

Looking to repower.....Dana
