&gt;I belive the smaog pump was on 74 only.

It also came on 1973 busses, at least in California.

&gt;Spezial double groove crank pulley

Eh?  It was driven from a separate pulley assembly which is attached to the 
fan housing and driven from the fan hub.  The fan itself is different from 
the '72 only in that the center portion where the three bolts attach it to 
the hub is flattened (as opposed to pointed to aid airflow) to accept the 
flange from the pulley assembly.

&gt;If Califonicadia requires the pump down there, there would be a
&gt;market if it is still functional (not likely).

They are suprisingly durable.  Maybe partly due to the fact that the pulley 
assembly was not so durable and many have simply sat on top of the fan 
housings for years, or been removed altogether.  I have come across many of 
them over the years and all were working.  Any VW-only junkyard should have 
a pile of them, and if you have time to look they can still occasionally be 
found in the Pick-A-Part places, usually lying inside or next to the bus in 
a pile of parts that were hastily stripped from the engine in order to pull it.
