Subject: Re: Fire extinguisher mounting

&gt;Can anyone recommend a good place to mount a fire extinguisher?

Can you mount a clip to hold it somewhere overhead in a fairly secure
location?  Preferably not where it can drop on your head; that would be a
Bad Thing.

My immediate thought was:  on the ceiling, between the front seats, unless
there's something else up there.  That could be reached from either front
seat or from the rear.  Now that I've thought about it, I think that's where
I'll mount mine.  Thanks for the brain jog.
