Subject: Re: [T2] Engine swap snag - different flywheel type

Hello Peter  everything will be different,  you will need a new clutch disc, 
pressure plate, you might as well put in a new TOB,  flywheel seal and o ring 
also you will need a pilot bearing and the flywheel bolts. I have some 
flywheels and bolts that you can get . Later and have fun  Mark dearing
