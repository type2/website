Volks,

First, another big &quot;Thank You!&quot; to Karl, who sent me not only a set of
Mercedes nuts, but a set of bay nuts and a vanagon nut.  As long as I had
them all side by side, I dragged out the camera and took some shots.  I
have put them at:

In looking them over, I have the following observations to offer.  I knew
the Mercedes nuts were going to be thinner, and was a bit worried that
there would not be enough bearing surface in the threaded portion of the
nut to hold securely.  The Vanagon is a substantially heavier vehicle than
the Mercedes sedans, after all. After looking them over and measuring them
up, tho, I am very confident that I will actually be getting *more*
support from the Mercedes nuts!  The Vanagon nuts have a total thickness
of 14.2 mm vs. the Mercedes nut's 11.3mm, but in the process of deforming
the nut to lock it in place, it looks to me as if the upper part of the
Vanagon nut is relieved of its load-bearing duty.  On the used vanagon nut
that Karl sent, the width of the bright threads is only 7.2mm.  If I am
misinterpreting what I am seeing, please let me know, but I believe that
this 7.2mm is the total &quot;working area&quot; of the Vanagon nut. I also believe
this is why the Vanagon nuts fail.  The 11.3 may still not provide enough
threaded area, but it provides way more than the Vanagon!

I will be installing the Mercedes nuts later this afternoon and will
report further on how they perform in a month or three (after I have
driven them to Seattle, to LA, and back :-) but right now I am thinking
this is a very good upgrade!
