Subject: Re: [T2] Friday-Deadheads and busses

On 3/8/02, sean_fulkerson_at_hotmail_dot_com thus spake:

&gt;I've come across many T2's owned by folks who've probably never
&gt;listened to a Dead tune, let alone followed them, whose buses were
&gt;*so* torn up it would make you cry. My previous bus (a '75) fell
&gt;into this category -- fuel injection converted to carbs, &quot;new&quot; wiring
&gt;that served no purpose at all except to create hard-to-trace shorts,
&gt;seats not bolted down, holes patched with old license plates, a toggle
&gt;switch on the dash to bypass the horn button -- you get the picture.

I'll second that...

My first bus was a '70 (the same one that I took to Inuvik) and the PO
was no deadhead-he was of hispanic nature is my guess, although I got the
bus from the junkyard so I dunno for sure(but he was clearly no
deadhead). Anyway, the ignition had been replaced with an old AMC switch,
the headlights had been rewired to a cheap toggle switch which was slowly
melting, the drivers side rear view mirror had been replaced by a mid-70s
era car mirror which blocked the vent wing from opening, judicious
amounts of bondo had been used in lieu of real body work... and the coup
de grace, #3 rod through the case. Don't have to be a deadhead to abuse a bus.
