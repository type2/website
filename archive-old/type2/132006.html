Subject: Re: [T2] Decison  -opinions needed

I have a rusty bus too.  I could afford to go buy a shiny perfect one.  Then
what would happen to mine.  It would likely soon become a piece of rusty
waste somewhere.  I can also make mine a shiny perfect one also.  This I
plan to do.  Of course, I have alternative transportation, that may not be
true for others.  I also want to do this, which also may not be true for
others.  I believe that I can do this, which may not be true.
