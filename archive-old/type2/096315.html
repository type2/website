Subject: Re: [T2] leaky valve covers

&gt; &gt; &gt; I too, have been using the 3M weatherstrip adhesive on the cover side

&gt; I dont bother with either method. I use dry gaskets, or possibly a little 
&gt; grease on the valve cover side, thats it. If it leaks you got another

same here I have always used a new gasket dry on my valve covers, rarely
have they leaked.
