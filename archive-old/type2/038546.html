Jupiter is a house brand made by Hercules.  I've also seen them with other
names such as Merit.

I had a set of these in standard load on the bus before I wised up to the
need to run reinfored tires.  The standard load tires were M+S rated, but
the C and D rated tires (exact same tread pattern) were not!  I hope that
they got around to certifying them in the stronger ratings.
