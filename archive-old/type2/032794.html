Subject: Rear Engine Cover

I have a '71 deluxe walkthrough. Here is how it is set up:
On top, in the luggage area it is fiberboard with a thin felt like
black covering. Held down with screws and washers.

In the engine compartment, attached to the ceiling, was a 
fiberglass matt in plastic bags with a carboard / uncoated
masonite cover filled with 1/2 inch holes. Mine has a cherry
burn hole directly over the carb!

Someone sez:
&gt;
&gt; my 71 bus cover appears to be a cloth covered masonite that is perforated, 
&gt; like peg board and it is sagging.  If we come up with a real definitive 
&gt; answer I might replace it.  I wish people wouldn't ask these questions that 
&gt; prompt me into action.


I am working on a a replacement. First, I replaced the fiberglass with 
cut pieces of fiberglass hardboard with aluminum facing on both sides. 
(Get at Homer D Poe where siding is sold. Seal the edges with duct tape.)
Over (under) that will go aluminim sheeting. Also sold at Homer for use behind
radiators as a reflector. Cut to size plus 1/2 inch, bend that 1/2 inch
over to

roll the edges. Attach to body with self tapping screws for steel stud
drywall.
(But, you have to drill pilot holes in the stringers on top of the engine
compartment. )
The change from a porous covering over a loose insulation to a hard insulation
with three layers of aluminum will amaze you. I also stuffed the gas tank
compartment
with loose fiberglass, filled 'ripples' with 50 year caulk and put a good seal
on the gas tank area cover. It makes quite a difference. 

Now, instead of just being able to hear my crappy muffler, I can also hear
the 
whine of the tires and the wind noise!
