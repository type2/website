&gt; Keeping the story short:  A little old lady creamed the left rear bumper,
&gt; light  and quarter panel of my 75 Westy while it was parked. I wasn't there
&gt; but she left a note and her insurance company, Allstate, looked confused when
&gt; I drove it in for their &quot;drive-in&quot; estimate.
&gt; 
&gt; The Allstate estimate (and he said he hadn't a clue if the parts were
&gt; available, yadda yadda) was $1,700.00 I knew that was low, but he said much
&gt; more than that and they would total the vehicle. That is bad for us. I have
&gt; another estimate in the $2800 range before a new paint job.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's the question: Should I total it? And then try to get a salvage title?

NO!!!   that's a cheap out for the insurance company.

fight em if you have the time and energy, there are other standards for
the value of a vehicle. 
. get the Green book value for older vehicles,
. go thru the archives here on this list and find the selling price of
similar vehicles.
. get an independent estimate.

mine was hit, they tried to total it, I fought and they eventually paid to
fix it...

good luck
