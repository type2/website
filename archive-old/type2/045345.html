Subject: [T2] ** Dead Westy ** (diagnostic help)

Hey, gang:                                                            
I've been off the list for a while because, well, my '82 gas Westy has
been running wonderfully.                                             
                                                                      
So much for the good luck ... it died this morning on the way to work.
If any of these symptoms look typical for a common problem, I'd be    
very grateful to tap your expertise and help me with the diagnostic.  
                                                                      
- For the past couple weeks, sometimes it's had a slight stumble      
up-shifting from 2nd to 3rd, or 3rd to 4th. Under acceleration it     
seemed fine.                                                          
                                                                      
- On odd occasions recently it was a little hard to start. Holding the
peddle to the floor and cranking for 3 seconds usually did it.        
                                                                      
- When I got the emissions inspection done last week the CO was 3.5%  
(barely passed). When I rebuilt the motor last summer and again when I
tested it in the Fall the CO was around .8-1.0%. (*thanks to Ron and  
Bus Depot for all their help on the rebuild*)                         
                                                                      
- I pulled the plugs to see if one cylinder was running rich (or wet) 
.... they all seemed to be sootier (richer) than normal, but the back  
two cylinders seemed to be a little worse. (could have been my        
imagination) When it died this morning it was at idle, and it seemed  
to sputter a little like fuel starvation.                             
                                                                      
- I haven't noticed any change in cylinder head temperature or oil    
pressure. I checked valve adjustments a month or two back. (yes, I    
know they are hydraulic) Supposedly, the air flow meter was replaced  
about 10,000 miles ago by the previous owner.                         
                                                                      
** So what do you think? Fuel pressure regulator? Plugged fuel filter?
Fuel pump? Something else? Any tips you can give me to cut to the     
chase would greatly appreciated.                                      
                                                                      
Thanks and cheers!
