Subject: Re: [T2] AC Compressor replacement

&gt;  On an '82, air cooled, which has A/C, it is the old style York/Techumseh
&gt; compressor.  I have had trouble with thoose on 134a conversions in the
&gt; past.  So the idea is to retrofit the compressor from a later model, or
&gt; other car.  Question is, which compressor and out of what?  I can't seem to narrow it down via the archives,
&gt; so am looking for additional input on this.

there's a direct replacement Sanden compressor, one of the vendors on the
list sells it but I can't remember which one
