Subject: Power Booster / Vacuum
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I rebuilt the rear brakes in my 73 bus (including wheel cylinder, pads
etc.) and also hooked up the power booster to the vacuum on my single weber
carb setup.  STOPS better than ever !!......... However, it doesn't seem to
want to idle.  The PO had plugged the hole in the manifold and left the
brake booster disconnected.  Now that I have hooked this all back up the
bus does not want to run right.  Does the vacuum have that much control in
the performance? What literally happened inside the engine when I hooked up
this vacuum ?  Do I need to just do a major tune up and re-adjust
everything?

Thanks for everyones help
