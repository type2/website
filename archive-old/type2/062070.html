Subject: LIST T-SHIRTS NOW AVAILABLE

OK then, I am going to do another run of t-shirts. Here are the details:

DESIGN:
  A 5-color design featuring line drawings of the front views of all 4
  generations of busses. Across the top is the word &quot;NETVERGNU:GEN&quot;, and across
the bottom is the VANAGON_at_LENTI address ONLY. The type2 list address is NOT on
there, so please don't be disappointed when you don't see it. These are the
same shirts, with a different color scheme, that I've done before. You can see
them on my webpage, the address of which is at the end of my .sig. Many folks
who have ordered them in the past can attest to their nifty design and
durablilty.
MATERIAL:
  The shirts are printed on high quality colored t-shirts that will hold up
through years of washing and working on the bus. Usually I get Hanes Beefy T's,
or a comparable name brand quality.
PRICE:
 A basic t-shirt costs $16.00, which includes postage and handling charges.
 This is for adult sizes S,M,L, and XL
 XXL shirts are available, for an extra $2.00 They are large enough to fit
those of you requiring a XXXL, which is sadly not available.
 SHIPPING for NON-USA orders requires an additional $5.00. This is for the
additional postage required. These orders should be preferrably paid in US
cash, or an international money order, which must be in US DOLLARS.

ORDERING INFORMATION:
  Please follow these directions specifically to help things work smoothly.
Note also that the directions are a bit different from in the past.
INCLUDE:
 1. A check made out to Richard Palmer (or well-hidden cash)
 2. An index card with your name, address, SIZE OF SHIRT, number of shirts, and
      your e-mail address

******PLEASE WRITE NEATLY!!!!!!!!!*************

ON THE ENVELOPE:
  Address it to:
  Richard Palmer
  121 - C Park Ave
  Raleigh, NC
         27605-1832

IN THE CORNER OF THE ENVELOPE, on the back side, please make a small note as to
the quantity and size of shirts ordered, such as 2 XL, or 1 S, 1 L. I am doing
this, because if I don't get enough orders, I will return all the envelopes
un-opened. Sadly, last time, I got burned, and ended up getting stuck with a
lot of additional costs because folks didn't follow through on their e-mail
confirmations. So, be advised, that if you sent e-mail promising to order a
shirt, then I shall pester you until I receive your order.
:)

OK, then, get to it. THIS OFFER EXPIRES the 21st of September. That gives you
about 3 weeks to mail them, but please don't wait. I will place the order then,
so if I get your order the next day, alas, it shan't get printed.
So, if you plan to order, PLEASE DO SO NOW! The sooner the better. If I don't
start getting orders in, I will get really disappointed, and feel bad about the
whole project.

As far as stickers, if this goes well, then perhaps I shall do another batch of
stickers in a couple months. So, if you want stickers, buy a shirt, and help
further the sticker cause!
:)
Thanks, and Have a lovely day!
