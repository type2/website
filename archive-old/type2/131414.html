Subject: Timing marks: 1973 1700

DPO had painted the engine compartment on my 73 Bus. He painted the pulley 
and the timing mark plate. :(

I know I'm going to have to try to find the pulley mark, but does anybody 
have a replacement timing mark plate? I soaked it in brake fluid to see if I 
could find the stamped marks, but it seems that they had sanded it smooth 
before painting.

Thanks,
Don
