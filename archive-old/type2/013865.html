&gt;    I am not a pilot but I am an aircraft mechanic and CO poisoning is
&gt; something to be very much on guard against.  Sporty's pilot shop and most
&gt; airport shops where planes are serviced sell a small (2&quot; square or so)
&gt; passive CO detector.  This is self adhesive and can be mounted on the dash.
&gt; It is a plastic panel with a circle of chemical that is yellowish white in
&gt; the center.  When exposed to CO it turns brown to black and is good for
&gt; several months.  They sell for about $5.00.

The reason that aircraft pilots are so concerned about this is that they
have a very VW-like heating system (heat muff around the exhaust pipe) but
with the difference that they don't have the heavy cast section in the
exhaust pipe.  for some reason aircraft manufacturers don't want to carry
50 pounds of heat exchangers around!  :)

The chances of a exhaust leak are much less in a VW than a plane for this
reason.  Still, it pays to be careful!
