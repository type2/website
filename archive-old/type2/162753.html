Enough sunlight reaches the Earth *every* hour to meet the world's
energy demand for an entire year...The problem is, that sunlight is free.

&gt; choke shaft on the BIGGER Solex I'm preparing for my '73 1600.  The main

Robt, The better? stuff than hylomar for that is called &quot;copper&quot; 
gasket...looks/works  about the same as the hylomar, but you can use it
for really hot exhaust stuff if you want(as long as you have good square 
metal flanges).  It works great on the inlet and outlet side of a turbo on 
a 68 bug.

I haven't had stellar results with hylomar...even tho it cost about $25/ 
tube here and my aircraft buddy claims it is *the* hots.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  &gt; any reason not to remove the  catalytic converter from a 77 camper bus 
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;  just put  in a straight pipe ?

Straight pipe should make it run bettter!



&gt;&gt;&gt;  its a California model , but not registered in California anymore,
&gt;&gt;&gt;  my friend wants to drive it down to Central America and is afraid the
&gt;&gt;&gt;  catalytic  converter  will get clogged up with bad gas,
&gt;&gt;&gt;  Will it run any different?
&gt;&gt;  &gt; thanks for your thoughts
