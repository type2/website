Sorry for the lengthy post!!

Here is information regarding BBtB.  As you can see we
have been working very hard at putting together a fun
filled, relaxing weekend.

This year we will be invading the wonderful town of
Brunswick.  The dates are September 14,15 and 16th.
We will be hosting Busses by the Buoy at Thomas Point
Beach in Bruinswick, Maine.
Directions are as follows:
FROM THE SOUTH:
Exit 9 off Interstate 95 to Brunswick.
FROM THE NORTH:
Exit 24 off Interstate 95 (Topsham) to Brunswick.
IN BRUNSWICK, take Rt.1 to Cook's Corner, BNAS,
Islands-Exit (Rt.24) straight. Just off Rt.24. Follow
signs, only three more miles!

Please call them and let them know you would like to
reserve a spot.  The number is (207) 725-6009.  If you
have never been there, it is rather large and there
are numerous things for people to do.  I have
personally tried out the slides on the playground and
let me tell you they are fast!  I would suggest
bringing an extra extension cord.   The electrical
hookups are far between.  But, there is electricity.
I remember a few years ago, electricity wasn=92t even a
problem.  No one wanted electricity.  My how times
have changed.  Now I need my microwave and laptop
computer, not to mention my hairdryer to blow-dry what
hair I have left!!   In the brochure, it says pets are
not allowed.  Please disregard that, as we are allowed
to bring pets.

We have a great weekend planned or not planned depends
on what your idea of a vacation is.  There is a rumor
flying around on vanagon_dot_com about a sailboat coming
up for the weekend.  Anyone for day cruises?   For you
consumers, Freeport and the home of LL Bean is right
next door.  Who needs some retail therapy??

The lobster dinner will be the same as last year.
Same folks.  Please let us know as soon as possible at
the campground if you want lobster.  Kathy Haynes will
be the lobster captain as in years past!!  Yeah
Kathy!!!

Ben &amp; Jerry=92s has once again donated ice cream.  Who
wants to scoop ice cream?  I think this year I will
enlist the help of Dave Wallace.  Not only is he
printing our shirts for the weekend, he will be
scooping our ice cream.  I like teams, so why not have
Roger Plante help Dave scoop?  Roger designed the
shirts!!

I have been on the phone with tons of Volkswagon
related vendors and this years raffle should be just
as good as last years, if not better!!!  I have a tent
from Eurocampers_dot_com, an awning from Equinox, a towing
hitch from Dennis Haynes, gift certificates from the
Bus Depot, Van-Again, PLF, rocky Mountain Motorworks,
$200 off an engine from Tiico, something from Fiamma,
wonderful dinner with me!!! and catalogs from every
person you could think of.  Tickets are $1.00 each.

We will be having the potluck breakfast again and this
year Bill Kaehrle from Ct will be the breakfast
captain.  Good luck and welcome aboard.  This is his
first year and he wanted to be involved.  Lets hope he
comes back next year!!  These are the items that he is
looking for.  I can=92t wait for breakfast!!
baked goods
fruit medleys
breakfast meat items (including hash of course)
charcoal grill station for meat items (ham/sausage) ?
egg dishes
other main dishes incl. veggie/soy choices
omelet station setups =96 pans - stoves
omelet station food prep items
chafing dishes and sterno
