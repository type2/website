Subject: The Beam&lt;still?!&gt;: Part 5.2:The Plea for help&lt;again?!&gt;

First, before i do part 5 of the story of the beam, i guess i should, 
need in fact, to put out a plea for help..again..

this time, its not quite so bad..

The first part has the do with a curse...it seems to affect all 
Raistricks, i alreadyknew i was affected, but, it seeems my dad is to. We 
cant bleed brakes...follow any and all instuctions to the T, even use the 
cutey little bleeder things for the idiot...nothing...:(

So, any volunteers in the KC area to bleed my bloody brakes? &lt;that, or 
my master cylinder died, while part 2-4 were going on...&gt;


as for the second part, a not quite as nessesary, but, i need to find new 
ends for my drag link. WE all know what it is, and &lt;on a 69 at least&gt; 
that it has ends, &lt;and not, oh, say COTTERPINS! as one LAPS guy told me..&gt;
now, are these ends the sameas the tierod ends? if so, which? inner or 
outter?

if not, where do i find them? or should i just get the whole drag link 
from Western Auto, and hope it has the ends on it? &lt;local to Kansas City 
would be nice, but...Mail order will work..&gt;

alright..thats it...i hope..:)

now, off to write part 5....

...david
