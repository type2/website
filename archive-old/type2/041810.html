Subject: Re: 84' seats in 77' bus?

Volks,

The next time you visit your local u-pull-it yard sidle on over to &quot;the mid 
to late 80's small toyota van&quot; isle.  The front seats in these things come 
right out and the tracks are bolted in, not welded.  They vary from basic to 
plush velour with nice arm rests depending on the trim level of the van and 
seem to be a lot more common than vanagons.

I picked up a set that I have NOT installed yet.  I have placed them in the 
van, though, and they &quot;sit&quot; quite nice.  Height was good etc.  I will 
probably try to weld the tracks in place.
