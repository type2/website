[concerning 195-75R14 tires]
&gt; Under-capacity - yes.
&gt; Under-size? 195/75R14 is roughly the same diameter as 185R14 (An 80%
&gt; profile is implied in these tire sizes, although it is not explicitly
&gt; stated- like 185/80R14):

Actually, the implied section ratio is 83-86%, and it varies with the
manufacturer.  An 80% section ratio is not implied, which is why you
see it in tire sizes.
 
&gt; Tire radius profile = size * profile.
&gt; 
&gt; 195 * 75% = 146.25
&gt; 185 * 80% = 148
&gt; (This gives distance in mm from rim to tread. To get full diameter,
&gt; double this and add 14 inches. Then for circumfrance mult by pi -
&gt; 3.14159)
&gt; (1% difference).

I've measured the difference between the two tires (yes, I have a pair
of reasonably new 195/75R14s mounted on bus rims) and the difference
is a bit over 4% both in measured diameter and in rolling
circumference.  If you stand the tires next to each other the
difference is quite noticable.  The tires I compared are 195/75R14
Uniroyal Laredos in load range C and 185R14 Bridgestones in load range
D.
