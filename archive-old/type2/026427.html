Subject: How do modern cars do it ?
Date: Sun, 27 May 2001 19:47:44 +0100

Recently I had a courtesy car while my bug was in for repair (Van off the
road at the same time - just my luck) but it was interesting to compare the
two. The new car was very quiet inside but not acousticly dead. I guess I
can put loads of soundproofing in and get somewhere near here. A new Type 2
(yes we have them in the UK :-) ) seems to acieve this in camper trim. More
importanly though, the new car always seemed DRY inside. I don't mean either
the bug or bus has pools of water in but on a damp day they do seem damp
inside. 
Now new cars don't have de-humidifiers in them and my seals are excellent
but I wonder if it is down to the heating system pushing out dry heat rather
than our wet heat, better condensation control or magic ?
How can I replicate this on a van ? Can I ? I didn't use the heat on the car
so I don't see how it can be this. Is it just my imagination ?
Insidentally, the courtesy car wasn't half as much fun to drive (I hate
power steering) and no-one waves to you as you drive along. Oh, and even
with only 83 miles on the clock, it didn't start as well as the bug :-))
