Subject: westy tire cover needed

Does anyone have the little wooden door thingy that goes over the spare 
tire compartment (behind the driver's seat) in a '79 westy that they'd be 
willing to sell?  That's all I need to make my camper complete (except a 
new engine, but that's another story...).  If this is inappropriate list 
content, I'm sorry.  thanks, Greg
