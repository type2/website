&gt;Alright!  I didn't want to mention this.. but I have a &quot;survivor&quot; '57 Beetle,,
&gt;that has many many miles on it ,, year round in Ontario,  Canada, where we
&gt;pickle the roads pretty well..

&gt;The PO coated it with &quot;Fish Oil&quot; ...

&gt;I have had it for 10+ years and basically just stored it... the &quot;Fish Oil&quot; has
&gt;started to peel as it is drying out ... and under neath it is shinny black 
&gt;floor
&gt;paint,, like it was fresh from the factory!
&gt;
&gt;What is &quot;Fish Oil&quot;  ?   How can you paint over it....?

History
&quot;A Scottish-born sea captain, Robert Fergusson, noticed that when raw fish 
oil spilled on rusty metal decks, corrosion stopped spreading &quot;

Current day formulations are deodorised and contain rust inhibitors. I used 
a primer made by the same company as made the fish oil so it went over the 
fish oil no problems.

Cheers,

Martin
