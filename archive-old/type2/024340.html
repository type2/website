&gt; Will a 71 sliding door fit on a 73?  

I have a 70 door on my 78. The thing I needed is the CATCH on the door frame/jamb, to match the 70 lock on the door, as the 78 catch would not work.

I don't know when they changed the sliding door handle from having the key in the handle to the key in the door panel, but as far as I know that is the noticeable difference. That is also why I couldn't switch door locks to make it work.

I had to go back to the junkyard and pay another $5 for the catch so get it the first time!
