&gt; &gt;when I first got my bus I repainted it, with rattle cans, very high
&gt; &gt;quality rattle cans but still rattle cans.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;when first painted it look quite sharp, now 12 years later it is in need
&gt; &gt;of a redo, and some new rust spots are taking hold..
&gt;
&gt; I find spray cans just don't cure hard enough. Repaint the nose with spray cans and watch the chips appear from highway driving in short order.

quality quality quality....no problems with chippping
