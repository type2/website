I'm not sure exactly what you are looking for here.

There are tents that are designed to work with pickup truck camper shells that
should work on the rear end of your bus.

There was a tent offered many years ago that extended the sleeping area inside
your bus out the rear hatch.

There are still rear tents offered in Germany designed to work with a bus ,
but they are pricey.

Why stick in on the rear, when you can slide one on the side?
