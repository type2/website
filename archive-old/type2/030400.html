X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

volks,

Reading some of the posts on crankcase pressure and a variety of other,
apparently unrelated problems, I have finally decided to &quot;go public&quot; with
a personal hypothesis on how our engines die.  this *is* just a hypothesis
and not backed up with any data, but I thought I would lay it out for
comment and possible for proposals on testing.

Over time, I have come to believe that a lot of the faults in aging VW
engines can be traced to worn valve guides.  Back a bit, I got a free pair
of &quot;good used&quot; heads for my '78 block, and was considering putting them
on, but I had also just gotten a new set of guages, including a dial
indicator, and John Anderson was visiting so he volunteered to show me how
to use them.  Among the first tests we ran were for valve guide wear on
these heads, and I gotta say they were *terrible*!  the valves and seats
were fine, no recession or loosenes, but the valves rocked to 5-6x the
high end of spec!  Other heads I have tested in the same way all show
large amounts of wear in the guides.  I have also picked up a feeling from
discussions of rockers on this lists that the rockers exert significant
side forces on the valves as they are depressing them, which increases
wear in the guide (never mind David Shwarze's picture of the unsupported
guide in his &quot;new&quot; head).

Once the guides start to wear, exhaust gasses start to leak out along them
and into the valve cover and case.  I used to think this was pretty
insignificant, but am coming to believe that the pressures may be in the
dozens of pounds or higher!  As a result, we experience the unfixable oil
leaks that people complain of (pushrod tube O-rings leaking, oil coming
out the dipstick, plug blown out the front end of the camshaft).  At the
same time, mechanical diagnostics like compression tests show nothing
wrong.  The rings are still sealing, the valves are still seated, etc.  so
the leaks are just a mystery.

Finally, as the leakage gets worse, and that one slip on refilling the oil
happens, combined with the oily-ness of the block and heads, the head
overheats one day and the aluminum gets a bit soft under the valve seat.
By this time, the valve is not just travelling in and out, but has a
signifacant side-to-side motion, a combination of the off-center rocker
forces with the looseness in the guide that allows these forces to be
translated into motion.  When the rocker comes off, the spring pulls the
off-center valve up toward the seat.  As it hits the seat off-center, it
forces the valve toward the center, but also (action and reaction) forces
the seat off to one side.  If the head is hotter than some critical value,
the aluminum is soft enough to allow this to happen, and the seat begins
to move.  From there to a dropped seat is just a couple hundred miles.

My questions:

Is this plausible, or is it just the flashbacks that they promised me?

If it is, is there a way to test pressure in the crank case?
  (I know that there is *some* pressure there, from an attempt to remove
   the oil filler cap while the engine is running :-)

How important is valve geometry to this problem?  Specifically, the angle
between the valve adjuster and the valve stem. I have seen some pretty
slap-dash valve trains out there :-(  and tho I have not measured the
angle, my gut feeling is that it is upwards of 5 degrees

And if it is important, what can be done to measure and correct the angle
at the rocker and the valve head when the come in contact?  Shim the
rocker shafts?
