Subject: Re: [T2] Possible areas of oil leak?

&gt; I have been having a leak on my 2.0L 77 Westy since I got it, and

&gt; rocker arms, and although two of them are weepy, they wouldn't cause

I had the same symptoms - tons of oil leaking from under my engine, 
especially when it sat after driving and it was driving me nuts.  Plus 
it was getting on my heater boxes and stinking up the car.  I *thought* 
it was from the oil cooler or somewhere in that vicinity because there 
was plenty oil settling around that area and I dreaded having to take 
off the fan housing to get in there.

Now, I knew that one of my outer pushrod seals was slightly torn because 
I could see the tear when adjusting my valves, but I didn't think it 
could cause as much oil as I was seeing.  Well, one day I pulled out the 
pushrod, put a new seal on there and also used some permatex avaiation 
form-a-gasket sealer... no leaks at all!  Nada, zip, zilch.

Moral of the story, oil can get blown anywhere under there.  If you have 
some oil drips around the pushrod tubes, then you might have a leak from 
those.  Since they're the easiest to fix, start there.  If that doesn't 
solve the problem, look elsewhere.
