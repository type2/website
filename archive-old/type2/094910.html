Subject: Blistered Electrodes

Fact or country myth??

Machine shop person said that if the spark plugs show microscopic blistering 
on the outside of the spark plug electrode, it indicates that the engine has 
bad or worn valve guides.

Outside of the electrode is the other side from where the spark jumps.

I guess I should be able to see these microscopic blisters with a 10x 
jewelers loupe.

Barry sends (another meaningless bit of trivia)
