Subject: idle question

Anybody have any &quot;first step&quot; suggestions for me.  I rescued a bus from
rotting behind an old garage.  It's been sitting for about 3 years.  I've done
some minor tasks (emptying tank, new accelerator cable, new batt., jump start
the starter) and still she's undriveable.  My problem is that as soon as I
start it up, it shoots up to extreme rpms.  As if I had it floored.  What
would everybody suggest my first step to be (after beating my head against the
wall, done that) ...spark plugs?  rebuild the carbs?
