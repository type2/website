&gt; &gt; In a friend's 71 westy, there are 2 cots.  One over the front seats and 
one 
&gt; &gt; &quot;upstairs&quot;  Mounted on the roof. Narrower than the front one and on a 
&gt; folding &gt; framework.
&gt;  
&gt;  Ah, yes, the dreaded &quot;PUNISHMENT COT&quot;.  I removed and stored mine.  Has
&gt;  any adult amongst us actually slept in one of these?  Have you recovered
&gt;  from it?

One of the PRIMARY reasons I now have a post '74' westy!!  ; )
