Subject: DH fan shroud oddity

Subject line says it.
I have seen a small sample of only five doghouse fan shrouds in my life.
Mine is slightly different then the others.  The interior opening that
allows the cooling air to the oil cooler has an 8 or 9 inch curved piece
of metal that would seem to &quot;catch&quot; the air from the fan very 
efficiently.  The other four shrouds didn't have this piece.  But they 
also didn't look like it was missing; i.e. no torn metal or spot welds 
showing.

Did VW make differing styles of DH shrouds?

Just curious.
