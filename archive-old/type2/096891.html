Subject: Re: [T2] Gauges A newbie Question

Dear group:

I have some rather dumb questions.   Before reading further realize 
that I have the Bentley book and the Muir on order, but I am new to 
the VW aor-cooled world since owning a Beetly in 1972.

This Spring I picked up a 78 Westy from a friend.   I've always 
wanted one and well, this was the time.

Reading all of your posts has been very handy in helping me make 
restoration and repair decisions on the Bus.

In the dash is a place to the right of the Speedometer that is a 
blank round punch-out.   I *know* i've seen a triple gauge unit there 
in someone's Bus.   It was Temp, Oil Pressure and one other just like 
in my old Mercedes of the same era.

Can anyone shed light on these gauge pods and where to get them?  Are 
they aftermarket or out of high-end buses?

Thanks in advance,

BEN
78 Westy (not yet named)
