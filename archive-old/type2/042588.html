Subject: Re: CV boot clamps

Hi,

&gt;      While repacking the CVs (for the first time), I
&gt; cleverly left off the boot clamps before reassembly
&gt; and greasing...
&gt; ...
&gt;  Is there a type of clamp I can get that can be installed
&gt; post facto? Can I use a heavy duty cable tie?

 I don't bother with them at all (they don't seem to be necessary and
I think they may increase the risk of a torn boot) but I've seen cable
ties used as an alternative to the metal clamps.
 The clamps I've seen could be put on with the axle installed, too,
since they wern't continuous.

Cheers,
