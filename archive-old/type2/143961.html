Subject: Re: Weber 34 ict questions

&gt;I bought a set of 2nd hand weber 34 icts from the
&gt;Samba. Firstly, it seems to be impossible to tighten
&gt;the lower two nuts that fasten the manifold to each
&gt;head. The nuts barely clear the manifold.

Have you tried using nuts with 12mm heads? Maybe that
would give you enough clearance to tighten them.
