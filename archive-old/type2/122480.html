Subject: Alternator questions

Hey Folks,

I am replacing my alternator.  I got a replacement from one of our favorite
vendors.  I am removing the old one.  I goat everything apart, up to the
electrical connector.  It appears that there must be a part that comes off
the old and goes onto the new-a plate on the rear.  The cable goes through
this part, there is a rubber grommet.  I suspect that I must remove this
plate so that I can disconnect the cable.  Additionally, the cooling air
feed connection must also be on this part, for there is no such provision on
the new alternator.

Does this seem correct?

Thanks,

reh
