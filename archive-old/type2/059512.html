Subject:  Re: '79 Cal bus - EGR filter?

I once owned a '79 California Westy. It had no EGR filter. It did have 
an O2 sensor.

I now own a '78 California Westy. It has an EGR filter but no 02 sensor.

Just for the record, replacement 02 sensors cost less than EGR system
components. (About $70 for the sensor vs. $85 for the EGR filter last time
I checked , plus various exorbitant junkyard prices for no longer
manufactured EGR valves, connecting pipes). 

Drive safely,
