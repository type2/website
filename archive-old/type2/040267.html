Matt:
  We have experienced the identical symptoms you mention with our old '80 camper:  failure to start when we stopped for gas on long roadtrips.  The problem was resolved by replacing the solenoid, not particularly expensive or difficult, and the problem never recurred.  Just an odd related tidbit:  when the bus failed to start we could whack it good once or twice with a tire iron and it would start right up!  Gotta love those VWs.
