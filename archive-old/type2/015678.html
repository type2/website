If your rear condensor is the same size as mine (rather large, about
30&quot;x30&quot;?) it shouldn't be a problem.  I only have the single condensor.

&gt;Neither are really

I wouldn't say that.  My dpd/134a system works very well - this summer I
drove the bus through Blythe, Ca where the outdoor thermometer was showing
105 at times and I never broke a sweat.  The temperature at the vents is
not as cold as some (mid 50's when it's real hot outside) but it's cold
enough for me.
