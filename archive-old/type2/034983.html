Subject: Re: Ruminations on heating a VW bus

&gt;&gt;It may be possible to put some of those modern electrically heated
&gt;(front)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;seats into a bus from a modern vehicle.  (I wouldn't do it myself - 
&gt;I'd
&gt;
&gt;&gt;rather keep the stock ones.)   But it is at least a possibility.  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I imagine they take a fair bit of juice from the battery, and you'd
&gt;almost
&gt;
&gt;&gt;certainly want an alternator (not generator) fitted.  It may even be
&gt;
&gt;&gt;possible to take the heating elements (etc...) from a modern car and
&gt;
&gt;&gt;actually fit this into a standard bus seat.  (Obviously there are
&gt;safety
&gt;
&gt;&gt;implications - all that VW horse-hair style padding may not mix with
&gt;
&gt;&gt;electricity too well !?)  But some brave soul might like to try it.

Howard and list,


There's a company that makes a line of 12V seat and bed warmers for the

RV and trucker crowds.  They do pull a lot of juice but also seem to be

very well made and they apparently haven't electrocuted anyone with 
them

(over the last 30 years).  These folks don't do any advertising but I

do have a pamphlet of theirs somewhere.  If anyone's interested, let me 

know and I'll post it.
