Subject: Re: [T2] sandblast pushrod tubes?

They are pretty thin, and sandblasting is really corrosive. Do you have
glass beading or walnut hull blasting available? Much better on thin metal.
I would paint them flat black afterwards to aid in oil cooling. Flat black
is a much more efficient transmitter of heat than plain metal.

Subject: [T2] sandblast pushrod tubes?
 
I'm thinking of sandblasting them to get them nice and clean. I just
wanted to check if there was any reason not to. I wouldn't need to
paint them afterwards, would I?
 
any thoughts?
