Hi,

I just bought a '78 bus, I had a knocking as well that went away 
when it cooled down.

I had driven it about 1000 miles in a day when it happened.

A call to the dealer revealed his suspicion that I may have a bad 
CV joint.

I checked it by rocking the van while driving and sure enough, the 
noise increases on a slight rock to the left. I had been driving in a 
gear that had allowed the joints to not be &quot;torqued&quot;. 80 KPH to 90 
in 4 th gear.

It is suspected that the grease has gone old on me. 126,000 KM 
from the factory to me. 2 owners.

I too thought my engine had gone.

To get home on the last 300 KM's of &quot;no man's land&quot; highway, I 
drove at about 55 to 60 mph in 4th and not a click to be heard.
note*********
I do not recommend you try this as you could snap a shaft and get 
hurt.

I do suggest you CONSIDER getting your CV joints checked if your 
history is like mine.

Be careful!!

Peace,
