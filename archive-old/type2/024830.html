For sale:

1969 Westy Camper.
Includes original fridge/sink, childs cot, and upper cot. (And rest of
interior).
 Westy manual, dealers manual (with service stamps) included.

I was the second owner, and now I am the fourth (bus came back as I
requested when I sold it.)
 Bus has only a couple of small dents, but has significant rust in lower
body parts.

Runs.
 Replaced tranny last year.
 New brakes; master and slave cylinders replaced as well.
 Pull out 50 watt stereo w/ equalizer.
Front end needs work, so complete front end ready to go on included
New Bearings
New Shocks
Oil temp guage
Special oil cooler set up (not being used currently, but there if you felt
like adding a bigger motor.
Stock 1600, Single Port.

This bus has a certain feeling about it that I have experienced with very
few other busses. I really liked this one, but with 5 cars 1 has to go and
it is in the most ready state to go.

$900

In Olympia WA.
(360) 786-8338
