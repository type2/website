Subject: Re: [T2] Central Ohio Gathering

Hi Frank,

Isn't Dixie Bus also the same weekend as the Dan Emmet Festival this  
year?  I was impressed by the COVW vent in 2004 but last year decided  
to give Mt Vernon a look-see and my family much enjoyed the music and  
arts festival. It was a slice of pure Americana that we don't get to  
experience all that often. (Whereas my family will tell you that we  
go to PLENTY enough VW shows.)

&gt; East of the
&gt; Mississippi.  Usually over 400 registered vehicles.
&gt; So we have something for everyone... Camping in beautiful Rustic  
&gt; Knolls
&gt; Campground, a vintage car show for the enthusiast, and huge  
&gt; cauldron of
&gt; chili for those who like to eat!!
