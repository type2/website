for tools you know which ones you use in VW repair, like having not one
but two small 10mm and 13mm wrenches. etc

of course don't forget your CAA/AAA card and the latest AIRS list.

I did this once some years ago bringing a (not VW) from LA to DC and it
was a blast, especially if you are not pressed for time.

tell dad to enjoy the trip.  not sure if there is an easy way over the
Rockies but I have found that unless you can take I-10 (just a little out
of your way) that I-80 seemed to have the easiest crossing of the big
hills.  Has your father driven the Rockies before, if not you have to
remember that you start at over 5,000 feet, and that is the bottom of the
hill so air gets thinner.  not just for the bus but for him too.

good luck
