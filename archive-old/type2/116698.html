Subject: RE:  what works well as a fuel line plug

I use the correct tool for the job...line clamps.  They look a bit like vice 
grips, but have flat, wide surfaces and a clamping mechanism.  They're 
available at Sears Hardware, among other places.  I have a Sears pair, one 
from Snap-On and another from Mac Tools.  All work well.
Steve
