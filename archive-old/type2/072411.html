I've got the Driver, Front Passenger, Middle bench w/armrest, and rear folding
bench out of my '78 seven passenger for sale.  They are brown vinyl and in good
shape. There is a small tear in the passenger seat and a seam seperating along 
the top of the rear bench.  I'm near Chicago and would really like to see
someone make good use of them.
