Subject: [T2] Relative useful value ratio

As others have already reported the 'relative useful value ratio' of the
list has deteriorated quite a bit over the last 6 month or so. I think we
need to get it up again. Now let's see how that can be done.

The ratio can be determined by dividing the total number of unique lines in
a typical digest mail message by the total number of lines in that message
:-) For example: if a typical digest has a total of 827 lines there may be
no more than say 413 unique lines (lines that contain info not repeated
elsewhere in the same digest). So the ratio is 413/827 = 0.5 Actually I
suspect it is lower.

It all boils down to quoting old messages in their full extent ! It's just a
waste of bits, bandwidth, storage and time. There used to be a rule about
excessive qouting and I had messages rejected because of that. Somehow that
does not seem to be enforced anymore. Can we reinstate that rule
voluntarily, please ...
