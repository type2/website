&gt; The plastic is split from one end to the other, the fuses aren't exactly
&gt; tight. The 3rd fuse holder looks like it has melted before. I ran to the
&gt; junkyard, and they only had a '69 with 10 fuses, instead of a '70 with 12
&gt; fuses. Anyone know where I can locate a fusebox for a '70. Or is there
&gt; anyway to replace it with something better? I'm searching the archives
&gt; tonight, but so far no luck.

Your original fuse box was yellow, correct?
The yellow ones split down the center. The replacement is white. I have
never seen a white one split. You need fuse box # 411 937 505A. This is for
a 70. 71 was B. 72 was C. There is NO sub for the A box. B and C have
different numbers but I can't see a difference in the boxes. [just for
reference: D is for a 73 411 and E is for 74 412]
I believe I have one. I will need to look tomorrow when it is light out. I
know where I have a B and a C......
