Claralw_at_aol_dot_com says of the 8-track player...

&gt; dont sell it!!!!! install it in your bus under the package tray and astound
&gt; people.  you can gets lots of 8 tracks for it too.  they are 69 cents each at
&gt; the loacl Oly, WA Goodwill

If it's an in-dash version, install it in the radio hole in the dashboard
and really turn some heads...if you're gonna have a hippie bus, why not have
a hippie stereo in it?

Of course, you gotta find somewhere to mount the state-of-the-art head-end
for the CD changer that actually makes the tunes you listen to...
