&gt; &gt;They also said that you cant purchase
&gt; &gt;new carbsfor this model.
&gt; 
&gt; Well...you probably don't need new carbs anyway but I knew Josh
&gt; Rodgers to
&gt; pick up a pair of Solexes at a swap here, in like new condition,
&gt; including
&gt; manifolds, for $15. Because I wouldn't give ten for them. They aren't
&gt; available OEM but that's nothing to get excited about. Maybe a deal
&gt; won't
&gt; fall in your lap like that but these things are not diamonds.
&gt; 
&gt; 
If your carbs are too far gone to rebuild, you can get new ones from
Just Kampers (http://www.justkampers.co_dot_uk/).  They're not listed in the
catalogue.  190 pounds the pair.  Add a chunk for shipping.  The Bus
Depot may have some as well, I don't know if Ron picked some up on his
travels.
