&gt; &gt; beginnig of my VW season.  But the engine is going away and I stat to built
&gt; &gt; a new engine.  I start from a new case that I've already ordered.  The

&gt; &gt; lasting.

&gt; you can buy a brand new 1600 VW engine for a little over $1000 and get
&gt; fuel injection and hydraulic valves,  that would be my first choice 

Well, it's more like $1500 and no fuel injection that I know of.  Still a
strong arguement pricewise.
