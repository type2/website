Subject: Re: [T2] oil filters and oil

I've been told by numerous sources just to use 20-50 Castrol year  round.  That's what Bentley recommends also, IIRC.  And I  would say that the Wix filter is a definite no no.  They may give  you a tad more power (not really even the right term) but you're going  to be sucking a lot more crap through the engine because they rate low  in terms of filtering.  Richard's site might have the comparison  chart that went out recently.  I think it came from Karl.  
  
  JMHO....KR

live in georgia and it gets really hot and humid here. the engine is the
2.0L .   i bought a wix filter from the local oreily store and have yet to
put it on.   some of the articles i have great give me a little trepidation
and reservation in using it.   i have a wix air filter too.  bad idea or
not?
