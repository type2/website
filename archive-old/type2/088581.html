Subject: &quot;Grant&quot; rings

I am in the midst of rebuilding/tweaking a couple of Type4 motors. 

One has 96mm hypereutectic (Keith Black?) pistons that came from MSHP
with Grant rings in the box (I think those nickel-bags _at_ MSHP swapped
out the rings). Anyway, I used the Grants, but have since heard
rumblings that Grant makes crappy rings. 

Since I'll have the heads off anyway (dropped seat on re-man head _at_20k)
swapping rings is not out of the question. I'll also need a set of
standard or .01 over 94's but planned to get those though list vendors,
etc. 

Any thought on Grants, and alternatives?

Developing business and guiding change since 1996,
