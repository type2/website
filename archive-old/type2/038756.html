Subject: Brake Flushing

Hi All-

I just received all the parts I needed for the rear brakes on my 70 Westy,
(new cylinders, shoes, and springs,etc..)I would like to flush the old brake
fluid out of the system. Can I just pump the pedal, letting the fluid drain
out the back lines while I have them off the wheel cylinders, making sure to
pour enough in to replenish what is coming out? BTW, on a 70 the reservoir
is a PITA to fill, any tips? Additionally, getting the axle nuts off was a
lot of fun. The first one I did with a five foot pipe and a two foot stilson
wrench. Bent the wrench as the nut finally came loose. For nut number two I
waited till my parts came, along with the dog bone 46mm thing. Three whacks
and the nut was loose. Mucho easy.
TIA
