Subject: bottom cooling housing flaps

I have a 78 westy and on the bottom of the cooling housing there are 
some ducts and little flaps (bentley, engine and clutch, pg 21, fig. 
7-3, part 24).

What do these flaps do and do I really need 'em?  My guess is that when 
the heater fan is on and the car is idling, it keeps hot air from 
blowing back into the cooling fan housing.  I would assume that during 
higher RPMs, the cooling fan air pressure high is enough to overcome the 
heater fan pressure and direct the air away from the cooling housing. 
Sound logical?

The problem is that neither do I have the flaps and their hinges, nor do 
I have the cover plates that screw onto the heat exchangers to seal the 
connection.  I plan on making ducts to seal the connection, but do I 
need to make the little flaps, too?  I guess I could fabricate 
something, but I'd just like to find out if it's necessary.

thanks,
Mike
