Subject: Q-Pad substitute

Does anyone remember a few months back, there was someone who said they 
found a substitute for Q-Pads that was cheaper yet worked just as well? Does 
anyon remember what that stuff was? Even if no one remembers, does anyone 
have any suggestions? I'm starting to gather materials to insulate my bus 
per www.bulley-hewlett_dot_com/VWindex, but I don't want to fork over the money 
for Q-Pads if there is a cheaper alternative.

Thanks,

Jared
