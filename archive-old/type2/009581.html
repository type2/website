&gt;       If you change every 1500 miles, recomended for aircooleds, the
&gt;additives are always fresh and you get all the benefits with no risks.
&gt;20W-50 is going to be better oil over the long run in an aircooled than
&gt;straight 30 or even straight 40.
&gt;
&gt;       Bill

Huh?? When did 20W-50 change it's max temp range from 80º? Whether it's 
fresh, 1500 miles old, or 3000 miles old....it is still 20/50 no matter what 
additive package it has.
