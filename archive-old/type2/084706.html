&gt;   Shifting from 2nd to 3rd, it backfired (it blew the muffler apart from

Be sure to check the air flow meter flap. Backfires can and will warp the 
housing and the flap will hang up. Make sure it will open and close 
smoothly through if full range of movement with no rubbing.


&gt;The distributor rotor shaft turns around by hand. In fact, it lightly 
&gt;&quot;snaps&quot; into &quot;place&quot; every 180 degrees. This does not happen with my T1 
&gt;motor's distributor - the shaft only turns when the starter turns it.

Definately a problem with the dizzy drive. Broken lugs or sheared pin 
perhaps. Pull the dizzy and check out the drive cog. If that looks ok, pull 
the drive gear and have a look. That's a very rare failure but if the shaft 
turns by hand when installed you surely have a dizzy drive problem. Make 
sure that the dizzy is seated properly. Check to see that the hold down nut 
didn't come off and allow the dizzy to push up out of engagement. That 
seems more likely than a broken drive cog.
