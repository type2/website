Subject: Re: go/nogo resistance range for a coil?

Quoth Dan &lt;vw_bus_74_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;:

&gt; Bill,
&gt;    1.7 - 2.1 is a pretty tight spec. A range of .4 an
&gt; your coil is off by .9 which is over twice the 
&gt; &quot;acceptable&quot; operating range. Soooo I would get a new 
&gt; one... the fact the range is so tight would tell me 
&gt; that it is pretty picky and wouldnt tolerate much 
&gt; more than a .2 ohm  plus or minus the op. spec.

Hi Dan and everyone:

I agree about 'tight spec.'  If it had been &quot;1.5 - 2.0&quot; 
it would have indicated a lot bigger rounding error 
acceptable in the measurement, but 1.7 - 2.1 suggests 
that Chilton is sweating it to 1/10 ohm, not to 1/2 
ohm.  

But here's the funny thing: 

I finally took my ohm meter to the FLAPS this afternoon 
after I wrote you [boy, they must love seeing me coming 
at this point].  I asked them to bring out a couple of 
brand new Bosch coils.  I carefully checked, and both 
of them showed a little bit more than 3 ohms across 
terminals 1 and 15--that's a tiny sliver higher, even, 
than the coil I have in the bus now and even farther 
out of the range Chilton prescribes.  [I checked 
Bentley, Clymer, and Haynes, and none has resistance 
test numbers for the coil, though Haynes does have a 
voltage test.]  

Well, since I already have two coils [the one in the 
bus and a spare] that test out at that level now,  I 
didn't see the point in buying another one that would 
do it too.  At least not for now.  Maybe Chilton's 
numbers are suspect, or maybe I'm wrong.

Back to my puzzled pursuit of the problem.

thanks!
