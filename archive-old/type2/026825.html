Hey all,

It breaks my heart to post this, but here it goes.  If anyone out there in 
the Oregon area (Corvallis to be specific) has any interest in an 82 
Vanagon, minus a working engine, to repair or dare I say for parts, please 
p-mail me.

The body is solid, 2-tone brown paint, interior pretty clean (does have an 
oil spot on the carpet created during last engine install) with all seats 
and a bed adaptation for the back if interested.  To the best of my 
knowledge everything is working fine except of course the engine (broken 
crank), and the CV's have started making a some noise off &amp; on.

If you are interested, contact me and we can discuss the finer details.  The 
price will probally vary depending on your intentions, but of course I'm not 
looking for much here.  I'd just prefer to see it go to someone that has the 
time and resources to get it running.

Casey
Corvallis, OR
