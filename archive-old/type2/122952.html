Subject: Re: [T2] ignition advance kit

Good to know, so what your saying is unless im driving all year in the 
winter that it's
not a good idea ;)

On the cold note, woke up to -31 celcius here (not including the windchill) 
and the van
powered up (a little stiff on the steering) good - had it plugged in over 
nite.  I can't
wait till my car is fixed.. should be this week.  You know things are weird 
when
you feel sorry and guilty towards your van that your driving it in such 
extremes.

&lt;it just seems to love it though&gt;

James
-thanks for the advice.

&gt;
&gt;the catch-22 of this w/ VWs is that if you get more power from it, you
&gt;tend to run hotter. bad mojo here. leads to things like dropped
&gt;valves, etc.
