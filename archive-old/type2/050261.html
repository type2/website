Subject: [T2] '77 Adventure-Wagen for sale in NH, $2900

This rot-free Wyoming bus needs a good home soon, because I'm moving back
to Jackson Hole in February and, sadly, can't take it with me.
I converted my 1977 Transporter into a camper with a pop-top Adventure
Wagen kit, a propane stove and sink and the CLEAN interior of a 73
Westphalia.  The rebuilt 1800 cc motor has 20,000 miles on it and a Weber
carburetor for easy maintenance and plenty of power.  This bus comes with 4
all season radials used one summer and four studded snow tires, used one
winter, all on VW rims.  The color is white with an orange sliding door.  

Call Adam at 603 835 5500 or write back to me at this address to arrange a
test drive.
