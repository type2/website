&gt; A few years back I remember seeing that Bernie Bergman had developed
a hydraulic lifter kit for a type I/II engine.  You had to send in
part of your engine to be machined, or you could buy a turn key from
him.  What ever became of these?  Can you still buy a hydraulic lifter
kit for these engines?

As I recall, the hydraulic lifters weren't as reliable as the
customers would like.  You really need to have full-flow oil
filtration and a rear  seal to keep the oil clean enough for the
lifters, and there was a problem with supplying the lifters with a
sufficient quantity of oil.

Bergman pushed them for a couple of years and then hasn't said much
about them since.  I'd take that as a warning!

Adjusting the valves isn't all that difficult.  It takes me about a
half-hour to do.  Manual valve adjustment also gives you the
opportunity to assess the health of your valves and seats.  If a valve
suddenly gets tight you know that you have a valve about to fail and
destroy your engine.  With hydraulic lifters, there is no warning
until the head of the valve snaps off.
