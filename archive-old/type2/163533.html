Subject: Re: [T2] Rivets for the guide piece on my sliding door

&gt; I used a recessed nut and bolt, trying to remember what they aare called
&gt; where the nut has a shaft and the bolt goes into it, has worked fine for
&gt; several years and allows you to swap out the guide without taking all
&gt; apart.
&gt; 
&gt; took the old rivet to the home center and found a matching set. in the
&gt; specialty bolts drawers

Usually, &quot;threaded insert&quot; but good luck at Home Despot... I've found
that if you're askin' for anything less common than a nail, you're
usually met by a blank stare... 8-(
