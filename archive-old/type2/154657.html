Subject: RE: [T2] Are the Asian CV joints any good?

&gt; Are the Asian CV joints any good? EBay has a set of 4 for $85.


Let me preface this by stating that I am speaking generally here, and have
no experience with the specific CV joints in question (neither the ones on
Ebay, nor Airhead Parts'). However, the issue of Chinese made VW parts was
discussed recently on the Vanagon list, so by copying and pasting some of my
comments from that thread, I can make it look like I've put a lot of work
into this reply when in fact I'm slacking.   :-)

While I respect Jim Thompson's opinion, I would not paint quite as rosy a
picture regarding Chinese made auto parts as a whole. It is clear that China
is the next up-and-comer in the auto parts industry. But in terms of
consistency of quality, they're not there yet. I have seen huge variations
in the quality of parts coming out of China (often from the same factory,
indicating serious quality control issues).  Some have indeed been very good
quality. But most I've seen so far have been below OE quality.  At this
stage of the game, it's a real mixed bag.

This is, in my opinion, largely because of a lack of experience.  As
recently as just four years ago, there were only only 8 models of cars
widely available in China (yes, 8), and only 8 million cars in the entire
country (the most populous in the world) compared to 180 million cars in the
U.S. alone.  The most common mode of transportation was (and remains) the
bicycle.  The automotive parts export industry didn't even exist.  So this
is not a country that has much experience making auto parts. Even under the
best of circumstances, there is a learning curve with any new industry.  It
took the Japanese consumer electronics industry a decade to become a quality
leader, for example. Early on most of Japan's electronic exports were
low-end junk, but ten years later some of the same manufacturers were making
products that put their pricier American competitors out of business. The
same could be said about Korean electronics (Samsung, Lucky-Goldstar) and
automobiles (Hyundai).

It is reasonable to predict that the Chinese aftermarket auto parts industry
will follow a similar pattern. Right now it is in its infancy, but over time
it will mature. Eventually there will be a shakeout, and some real winners
will emerge that will give the best names in the business a run for their
money. But that hasn't happened yet.  Meanwhile, that industry somewhat
resembles the dot-com era here in the U.S.before that shakeout occurred.
There are thousands of players, none of whom has any track record at all,
and most of whom probably won't survive because they simply don't have a
quality product.  Without any real track record to look at, it can be very
difficult to separate the good quality manufacturers from the bad.
Therefore, while I certainly wouldn't advise against all Chinese made auto
parts (and increasingly there will be no choice anyway), at this point I
would advise caution if buying unknown Chinese made auto parts from an
unknown retailer or on Ebay.
