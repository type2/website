Subject: Oktobugfest at Puyallup, WA Fairgrounds 10-18-98

There have been inquiries on the Lists about a meeting of Listees at 
Oktobugfest.  To date I haven't seen anything posted in the way of 
arrangements, so I'm assuming it'll be &quot;catch as catch can&quot; again this year.  
I've had limited success in the past with identifying/locating Listees at the 
show, but I'll give it another shot on Sunday.

The following is excerpted from a message to another List member....

...I'll be at Puyallup no matter what I have to drive to get there.  I usually 
arrive between 10:00 and 11:00AM and stay until closing.  We've tried in past 
years to get List members together, but it hasn't worked out well at all.  I 
still don't know what Clara looks like, even though I've probably walked right 
by her a dozen times.  Last year someone pointed out Eric and Barb for me, but 
they were a long way away in a crowd and I still don't know what they really 
look like.

As before I'll be wearing a bright yellow baseball cap.  I'm old and ugly and 
about 6' tall with dark hair and beard and glasses, and I walk with an 
aluminum cane.  I may try wearing a &quot;Type 2 List&quot; badge again, but it hasn't 
made any difference in the past...
