Subject: Re: [T2] Engine deck lid

&lt;&lt; Hey all

Quick question. I know the deck lids changed in '77 to the welded on hinge but
are all pre '77 deck lids the same to '68? I have the old style that someone
wants to buy for his '69. Was there another change mid seventies?

Thanks
 &gt;&gt;

I think the change in deck lids (beyond the coathanger wire hinge) was in
'71...The lid with the removeable apron was slightly longer and the bulge
that contains the license light is different...The hinge and the welded a-
ron are two sins I can't forgive... ;-(
