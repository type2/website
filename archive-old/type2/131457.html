Subject: Preparing to spend Sunday on my 73...

A bunch of parts arrived this week from BusDepot:
New muffler
New tie rods

and I already had a pivot arm pin/shaft/link thingie kit. (I've heard like 
12 different names for this thing.) The drag link was replaced by a shop for 
me.

Now, all I have to do is get it running halfway decent so I can drive it to 
the inlaws since I *really* don't wanna do this kind of thing on the street. 
After my period of wanting to serve up roast bus last weekend, I went out 
and just sat with the bus with my Bentley in my lap.

I can't seem to find the fuel filter. Some of the responses I got suggested 
fuel delivery to the carbs being my problem. Does this bus HAVE a fuel 
filter aside from the tank screen? (I hope so. I really don't want to 
replace the pump.) Where might it be?

Thanks!!!

Don
