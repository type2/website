Subject: &quot;Shore Power&quot; to charge 2nd Battery

So I have installed my Hella second battery relay and it works like a 
charm, charging the battery while I drive and powering my heater on 
those cold Canadian nights. HOWEVER, I recently embarked on an &quot;in bus&quot; 
roadtrip entertainment center (Flatscreen, DVD etc)  project which will 
require a little more power from my system, though not prohibitive 
while the bus is running (300w) it would run the battery down fairly 
quick with the bus off. So, I got to thinking that it would be nice to 
be able to do something similar to what they do on sailboats, plug my 
bus in and have the &quot;shore&quot; power charge my accessory battery when I 
have access to a power outlet. Has anyone got any  experience or 
thoughts on this ?

Steve
