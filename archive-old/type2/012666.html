hey everybody,
i know its early and a quite a few of the east coast
listees are regulars, but id though id mention about
the Grassroots Music Festival this summer in upstate
NY.  The reason i mention it now is that the onsite
camping goes fast so even though the festival is at
the end of July, those spots are going fast.  its a
four day music festival located in trumansburg NY.  an
absolute great time for four days.  check out their
website at http://www.grassrootsfest_dot_org  i cant tell
you what a good festival this is, plus there are
always a lot of buses their as well.  i took pics of
some last year
(http://www.geocities_dot_com/vwcampin/grassrootsbuses.html?965488225910).
 sorry for the bandwith, just thought id mention it in
case some of you east coasters were looking for
something to do this summer.
