Patrick:

Your battery isolator/dual-battery charger or whatever you want to
call it switches the load automatically.  If you don't have one of
these, I'm not sure how you have your reserve battery hooked-up.
I don't know if VW/Westfalia ever installed a dual-battery system--
my '70 didn't have one.  Yours may just be the work of a PO.

If you just have the auxiliary hooked up to the alternator with your
starting battery, you will drain your batteries equally--draining your
starting battery deeper than is healthy, and will not fully using the
depth of your auxiliary.

An isolator insures that both batteries are charged correctly, that the
starting battery is used only for starting, and that the starting battery
will not be drained into the auxiliary battery when it is used.

I hope this clears up some confusion. : )

Again, if anybody knows better, let us know!
