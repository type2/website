Subject: Help!! BFG Offroad TA tires defective?

Volks,

I was just doing the pre-Everybus trip inspection, brake adjust, oil
change, etc. and noticed that three of my four tires have some nasty
looking cracks in them.  Pictures here:

I bought these tires at a swap meet a bit less than two years ago.  They
were brand new.  Since then I have put about 25,000 miles on them and they
have at least 50% tread depth remaining.  The specs are 27x8,50R14LT 91S
M+S Load Range C Max Load 1515 lbs at 50psi cold.

I don't know what to think of this.  The miles were mostly around town and
long interstate drives.  The only time they were really subjected to any
torture was one time in Arizona when I drove about 25 miles up a really
bad, rocky dirt road with a friend.  The road was probably the worst I've
ever driven on and sometimes I wonder how the bus even made it.  Put a big
dent in my new Dansk muffler and several in the pedal cover pan, to give
you an idea.  Anyway, that was over a year ago and I didn't notice these
cracks before.  I have always loved the stability and handling these tires
provided for my bus, and the majority of the Syncro Vanagons I have seen
have these tires on them.  Speaking of syncros, I tried to hit vanagon_dot_com
to look for a syncro list and it doesn't come up.  Anyone know what's going
on?

So what happened to the tires?  Defect?  Too many 100 degree Dallas days?
Did that one offroad excursion ruin them?  Regardless, I don't feel safe
driving to Everybus on these tires so I will have to find some new ones.  I
am pi$$ed!  Thought I was set for tires for a long time.  The tires say,
&quot;Offroad Champion&quot; right on them, they're supposed to be tough!!!

I would prefer to buy tires from Sams or Costco because I have the
equipment to mount and balance them myself (I can't stand being at the
mercy of the goons at Discount tire, NTB, etc.).  Unfortunately, no time to
order from Tire Rack unless I pay for overnight shipping, which will
probably be cost prohibitive.  So I'm off to the archives to hopefully find
reference to a tire at Sams or Costco that will be appropriate.
Suggestions gladly accepted, of course.

Thanks for letting me vent,

-David
