&gt; I got around to doing a compression test yesterday on my 82 Westy. #3 is at 
&gt; 90 and the rest are between 128 and 130. Ack!!! However I didn't adjust the 
&gt; valves before hand (I have the self adjusting valves hydro lifter thingys).
&gt; 
&gt; Would adjusting the valves make a difference? Could that be the cause of 
&gt; the low compression in #3?

it could. also did you try and put some oil in #3 to see if the
compression improved. (was this with a hot engine)

&gt; Is there an article out there for adjusting the valves on the Type 4 engine 
&gt; especially with lifters? I still don't have a Bentley, the cheapest Bentley 
&gt; I can find costs 70.00. I'm only familiar with Type 1 engine valve 
&gt; adjustment.

here are a few (the archives contain many more verions of these)

&gt; Also assuming the worst that this cylinder is getting ready to drop a valve 
&gt; and I need the heads rebuilt....how can I test the bottom end of the 
&gt; engine? I'm wondering if I could just get away with rings, a valve 
&gt; job/rebuilt heads, seals and such and leave the bottom end alone. I don't 
&gt; have the cash to do a full engine rebuild.

that will be a big question mark. If you end up pulling the motor, an
endplay measurement will give you a good indicator of the condition of
the bottom end. Only teardown and measure will actually give you a
definate answer. do you have any data on how many miles are on the
engine, this can help decide as well.
