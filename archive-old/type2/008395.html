&gt; Greetings...
&gt; 
&gt; I realize that this has been covered, although not too recently..
&gt; 
&gt; What's the word on engine flushes on ACVW engines?

before you do this, consider the following:  (bad Bill Nye impression!)

The oil passages in your engine are all different sizes,  Sometimes a
large oil passage leads to several small passages.  What happens if
your engine flush knocks loose a chunk of grunge that then gets lodged
in a narrow part of the system?  In a human, this is called a
&quot;stroke&quot;.  In your engine it's called a &quot;clogged oil cooler&quot; or a
&quot;fried bearing&quot;

Also, consider that any grunge you knock loose is conducted to your
bearings, where it probably won't have any beneficial effects!

The only right way to clean oil passages is with a complete teardown.
