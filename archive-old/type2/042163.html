&gt; What's the best way to get the window trim off from around the driver and 
&gt;  passenger doors ? I need to get to some rust around that area and want to 
&gt;  take of the trim and be able to put it back in without ruining it . Thanks 
&gt;  for any help!

1. wind widow down
2. remove inner trim panel
3. remove window from lifting mechanism - no need to remove completely but 
just lower to bottom of door
4. remove channel felt from top/side of sliding window
5. remove quarter light (vent wing) window
6. remove the clips that hold the felt channel and window trim in place
7. unclip the lower edge of the trim from the door
8. catch it as it falls off!

fitting is the reverse of above!

Good luck
