&gt; I am the proud owner, as of yesterday, of a Type 2, 1970 CamperVan.
&gt; I paid $500, major rust on lower panels, but still smiling here.
&gt; I would like to make it into a four wheel drive for trips to Baja.
&gt; Does anyone know if this is possible?

Congrats &amp; welcome.

While not impossible, it would sure be quite a daunting task to
convert a baywindow bus to 4WD. The vanagons were also made as
synchros which are 4WD versions. Nice, but pretty pricy.

You would have to devise a way to put power to the front wheels which
I see as almost as hard as getting the power for this out of the
transaxle. Unless you have a deep wallet or nice machine shop I
wouldn't try it.

Now aside from that. These busses go a lot of places you wonldn't
expect them to go. they are geared low (not as low as pre 67) and have
a good amount of weight over the rear tires. I'd spend my money &amp; time
learning good off-road driving in the bus. good luck.
