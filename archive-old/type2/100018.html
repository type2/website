Subject: Weird Brake problem.

This is occurring on my beetle but for the sake of this forum I'll pretend
it's happening on my bus.

I replaced all the brake components except the steel lines and MC. I bled
the brakes and have a nice firm pedal but. . .

If I drive it for a while the brakes get harder and harder, effectively
reducing the play in my brake pedal until there is none and the brakes start
to self-apply. This occurs not continued use of the brakes, as I can be
cruising down the freeway and not using them at all. It just happens while I
drive. I can get 10 miles or so before the brakes start applying. I can
relieve the pressure and continue by adjusting the brake pedal plunger
itself.

I'm certain that it is not expanding air in the lines as there is no
sponginess to the pedal ever.

Any clues?
