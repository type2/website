Subject: Re: [T2] emergency flasher

&gt; On my bus with the keys out of the 
&gt; ignition the flashers work, the red light in the
&gt; switch blinks but the green lights on the
&gt; instrument cluster do not light up unless the 
&gt; key is the run position.

Hmm, that's weird. Or could it be part of the
US-specifications? As far as I know all the European
emergenceflashers/turnsignal-indicators work as
follows:

Without the key in the ignitionlock only the emergency
flasher works. The red light in the knob blinks and so
does/do the green light/lights on the dashboard panel.
The turn signal indicators only work with the ignition
turned on. Of course the emergency flashers also work
with the ignition turned on.
