Subject: FW: Wiper arms, safaris, &amp; the AIRS site...

The AIRS site was intended to help the members of this list, and help us
build more community than simply replying to each others e mails.  It was
intended as a goodwill gesture totally.

I think some people's worries about the site being public are well-founded.
I would hate to know that some leech was pulling names and selling them to
spam generators and such.  I would almost be tempted to find that person and
practice the good old southern religious move of &quot;laying on of hands&quot;.

I would love to see AIRS stay public and free, but as it grows it's going to
be much more difficult to do that, and protect the names of the people that
are legitimately registered on the site.  Wade and I spoke about this when
we first created the site, but we may have to reconsider and change some
amount of direction.

Please be patient with us, and give input into how we may resolve this
issue.  As always, I am at your service, just rather quiet these days.  I
said so much for two years I have very little to offer anymore.

Charlie Ford
