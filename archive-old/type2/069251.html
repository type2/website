&gt; Hello...I'm a 15 year old who is interested in VWs.

Ah, to be 15 again.

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; I've been doing a LOT of research into VW busses and bugs, but I
&gt; prefer the bus.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; One last question, how much money should I expect to plunk into
&gt; this car?

Whether 15 or 45, the research can pay off.  As noted in a
previous post, geography makes a big difference.  Unless you have
towing or trailering capabilities (or a deathwish to drive an
'unknown' vehicle) research near where ever you are.  I live in
northern Illinois and regularly pick up the &quot;Tradin' Times.&quot;  It
has all the &quot;for sale&quot; ads in order by make and year.  Whether
you're in Florida, New York, Seattle or Montreal, there is
probably a similar publication near you.  Maybe it's Auto/Truck
Market or some other funky title, but a convenience store or
newsstand or magazine shop near you must have something.  It can
be a dollar investment which pays off.

See what's available around you--within a reasonable distance.
Even if you don't call or go see a bus, you can get a feel for
the market in your area.  Wait a week, buy another copy and see
what sold and what didn't.  If something is still listed, then
the price is probably too high and the seller willing to come
down.  With limited budget and no patience there may be one that
&quot;gets away&quot; before you can work a deal.  Let it go.

Some comparison shopping will pay off eventually.  Last time I
looked, there were several early 70s buses listed around Chicago.
A $500 needs work, a $1500 needs brakes and a $3500 needs tlc.
Someone with $2000 obviously can't get the good one but could get
two to make a good one and have spare parts.

Also, don't just look under &quot;VW&quot; because there is usually
something buried in the &quot;Vans&quot; or &quot;Campers&quot; heading by an owner
(or relative of an owner) who does not know what they have and
who may be looking for it.  Even under the &quot;Trucks&quot; section are
treasures because someone who doesn't know may put a single or
double cab pickup under that heading.  If you see &quot;59 VW truck&quot;
listed, forget patience, call on it fast!  It may be a typo and
really be a rabbit-based pickup, but it may also be an excellent
find that you would (of course) then post to this list!
