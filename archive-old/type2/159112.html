Subject: AVP motor report &amp; questions (pictures)

http://www.eucasafari.vendioweb_dot_com/AVP/


The local shop halted during the install of my new rebuilt AVP 2.0 motor 
when they saw something funny on the heads.

I don't know how quite to explain, so please take a look at the photo's.

basically part of the welded head seems to be chipping away, and they 
aren't sure if this is a failure or if the little bits should be bent 
and broken off prior to install, so they dont come out down the road and 
end up inside the motor.

I took a few other shots as well, showing things that cause me a bit of 
concern.

any advise, suggestions or other misc tomfoolery is of course welcomed.
