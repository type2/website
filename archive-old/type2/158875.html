Subject: Re: [T2] Shift rod bushings

Hi All,

Problem is solved.  And without pulling the drivetrain.

I found an HDPE cylinder in my junk box, about 1 1/4&quot; in diameter, 1 
1/2&quot; long, with a  ~1/4&quot; hole in the middle.  I turned it down small 
enough to slip into the shift rod tube, then bored the middle out to 
just larger than the shift rod.  I then cut the cylinder in two, (gave 
me 2 short tubes, each about 3/4&quot; long), then cut one short tube in 
half, to give me 2 C shaped pieces. 

Greased everything up, slipped the split bushing into the tube, and 
screwed it in with small wood screws.  

Shifting is much improved, though I still need to replace the front 
shift rod bearing. 

I can take pictures if need be, and I'm sure there's other bus owners 
out there who'd like to change that bushing without removing the 
drivetrain.  

One thing fixed, many more to go.

&gt;&gt;According to the Hayes that came with the '77 bus, it's necessary  
&gt;&gt;to drop the engine/transmission just to change the rear shift rod  
&gt;&gt;bushing.
&gt;&gt;Is that the only way, or is there a method I can use that doesn't  
&gt;&gt;involve investing so much time and effort?
&gt;&gt;I hate sloppy shifting.
