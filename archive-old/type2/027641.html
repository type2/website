OK I'm sure that &quot;Moe&quot; is the kind of guy who would prefer not to be called 
an angel.  I was climbing the famous Bus-killer, the Altimont Pass yesterday 
when the rubbing block snapped off my points.  No biggie except that I 
didn't have a spare.  Called the CHP to let them know I would have my oft' 
profiled and harranged bus rolling within an hour and then called for a 
friend to bring me a new set of points.  My Aircooled Karma visited me a 
moment later.  A Ryder truck pulled up in front of me and three guys got out 
and asked what my problem was.  I told them I was waitng for points to be 
delivered and the guy with &quot;Moe&quot; on the patch of his shop shirt said, &quot;hold 
on...&quot;  He rolled up the Ryder's back door and I saw about 8 flat four 
engines and trannies.  He removed the points from a donor distributor, put 
them on mine and waited for me to re-install it and get Ms Jonze fired up 
again.  By the time I had the timing set, he had pulled away and I didn't 
get to thank him properly.  He was headed down I-5 for L.A.

Moe, if you're out there, Thanks,
