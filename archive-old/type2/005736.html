In addition to everything Sean said, one of the first things to do on
the FI end is to check the fuel pressure, and check to see if your
system is staying pressurized after the engine is shut off.  If you
look at a FI trouble-shooting chart of &quot;symptoms&quot; and &quot;possible
causes&quot;, one item listed in almost every case is &quot;fuel pressure
problems.&quot;

If your &quot;hard start&quot; situation is only when the engine is cold (and
vacuum hoses and ignition check out OK) then I'd suspect the cold
start system.

&gt; My new 79 Westy seems to take at least 2 to 3 tries of 15-20 seconds
&gt; cranking before it will finally start. I was under the impression
that it
&gt; should start on the first try in a couple of seconds? My 78
certainly did ,
&gt; this one requires too much cranking in my opinion. Any comments on
this, or
&gt; am I asking too much?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Courtney
