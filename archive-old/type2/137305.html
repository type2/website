Subject: Re-When was first foam roofbed in Westphalia

A foamboard, 38.5x57.25&quot; was found in place of the cot on certain
European models at least back to 1971; I had one from Germany.  The
foamboard is our headboard now on our bed. It utilized the sunroof body
as did the cot option. Once you climbed up through the gap in the rear,
another piece flipped up to fill the gap.  It hinged in front and had
grabber forks in the rear so it could stay up with the poptop when the
roof hold-down  grabbers were inserted into the forks.  I have pics;
  can send to list members.
