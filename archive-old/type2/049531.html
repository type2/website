Subject:  re: Winter Trips (was Re: [T2] Driving in the Snow) 

Cara asked about driving in the snow, and what to take
along on a winter trip.

Cara, 
You've gotten lots of good advise, especially about
practicing in a parking lot or similar place.  I would
also recommend the spares and parts that people have
suggested, and also (someone may have mentioned this
but if so, I missed it), either a chain or a towing
strap or rope, so if you get stuck or slide off the
road, someone could pull you out.  I always carried a
25 foot good quality chain in our bus when we drove it
in the snow, and it not only got me out of a ditch or
two, but helped me pull a few others out of some
snowbanks, too.
Make sure that you know where the towing points are,
two, so you don't have to search all over in the cold
snow some dark night to try to hook up the tow rope. 
Don't accidentally tie onto part of the suspension or
steering gear!  There are loops under there that are
made to be pulled on for towing--figure out where they
are now!

Good luck, and keep us all posted of your trip.

Jim (in Wis)
65 double cab
75 bus  (Both resting in the pole shed while the      
    waterpumpers take us around in the snow.)
