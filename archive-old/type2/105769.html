Subject: My '79 Westy for sale...

Hello all,
I have been away from the list for a while and while away I have made 
the tough decision to sell my Bus.

I haven't been getting any use out of it and I feel that it should be 
owned by someone who will use it for camping and road trips rather than 
have it sit in my apartment complex parking lot.

The Bus is in good shape.  I've owned it since 1999 or so and before 
that it was owned by fellow listmember Bob Busick.

It's a '79 Westy with the deluxe camper interior.  I have put a web 
page up with the detailed description of the Bus's condition and lots 
of pictures.

Please go to http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/79westy_for_sale.html if 
you're interested.

The Bus is located in Springfield, Massachusetts.  Springfield is about 
1.5 hours west of Boston and 30 minutes north of Hartford.

Thanks,

Sean Bartnik
Springfield, MA
