Subject: Re: [T2] door panel clips

&gt; Anyone know how many clips are on each front door panel of a 73 Westy?  Are the 
&gt; clips supposed to go straight into the metal (door)?
&gt; thanks, Chris

I just did my door panels on a '70 westy and bought the clips from Go Westy.   They came 10 to a bag and I had to use 5 bags for both doors.   There were a few left over, so, I'd say there's about 22-23 per door.   The clips came with the rubber do-dads that go into the door first.
