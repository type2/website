Hello Chai,

    What you have is the lower ball joint has pulled loose from the control
arm.
    I'm not trying to insult you, but if you have to ask what happened, this
job is not for you.
    First you need to call a wrecker and get it off the street, and to a
shop with Volkswagen experience and the special tools required.
    Parts wise, at the very least you will need a lower ball joint, and a
lower control arm. As the ball joint &quot;presses&quot; in the arm, for it to pop out
something was loose. Also you could have several other parts bent or worn,
tie rod, shock come to mind.
    This is not an everyday failure, so you need someone with plenty of
experience, Volkswagen wise to check for further damage.
    Good luck, keep us posted.

Howard
