Subject: re:Bus Boys where are you 

I sent a message last week, and got a reply that they are moving their 
warehouse, and would get back in a week. They are probably a little behind
with replies by now;-)

&gt;Anyone know how to get hold of Bus Boys.  I thought I sent them an
&gt;email (BusBoys_at_aol_dot_com) concerning purchasing the upper flanger to
&gt;the gas tank filler connection, but got no response. I can't get through
&gt;their toll free number (800-792-2697).  Maybe they are putting together
&gt;their catalog? I would like to replace this part, so if anyone can be of
&gt;assistance, please help me out.
