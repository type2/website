&gt; 4.  My wife has no clue how to drive a manual.  Of course, she'll
&gt; learn.  I
&gt; heard a rumor someplace that doesn't SEEM very likely to me, so maybe
&gt; this
&gt; would be the best place to ask it.  A very unreliable source told me
&gt; that VW
&gt; had also made automatic transaxles?

I guess you could plumb a rare Type IV auto trans to your intricate custom
race engine.

Man, this is not the way. Getting a stocker in there is *plenty* of project
for a novice, and 50 bhp will push the 71 around  just fine. Meanwhile your
young lady has to learn to downshift and to heel-toe, which is a dicey
maneuver in a bus and is best learned in something like a Camry.

There is nothing very special about a 71 interior (except that plastic
ventwork on the cab doors is nice for an armrest) and if you've priced new
vinyl interior panels, you might want to consider working the entire thing
in birch or ash.
