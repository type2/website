Subject: Front window drain holes??


With the talk of water building up along the front windshield, has anyone
ever drilled holes for draining?  I have been thinking about doing this,
but don't know how I would set up a drainage tube, etc...   On my
boyfriend's '78 f*rd (that he's restoring) the front window frame has 2
holes, one on each end of the window.  And because of that, there was no
rust under his seal!!

If anyone has tried this, please tell me how it worked &amp; where the water
drained to.

thanks,
Keri
