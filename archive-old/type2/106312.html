Subject: Re: [T2] Electric or Propane conversions

&gt; &gt;Does anyone have any information on Electric or Propane conversions for type
&gt; &gt;2s?  What I'd love to do is convert the bus to electric and wire in a small
&gt; &gt;Honda generator making it a hybrid.  Has anyone done this?
&gt;
&gt; I'm sure someone has tried it.  Know that a &quot;small Honda generator&quot; isn't going to be nearly enough to keep the batteries charged while you drive.  An electric bus will draw 30-40,000 watts or more during acceleration and maybe 10,000 watts while cruising.  I guess a small generator could improve the range somewhat but it isn't going to make the vehicle self-sustaining.


No but maybe you could recharge the batteries. For a commuter vehicle this
really doesnt seem that half-baked. maybe you could have the generator on
a timer to cut it off automatically.
