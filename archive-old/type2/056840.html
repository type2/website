Subject: LONG road trip in 71 bus, 11th hour brake repair.

well,

I am taking the phoenix (71 bus, risen from ashes of engine fire that
almost consumed entire vehicle) on a LOONG road trip.  I will be following
a rock and roll band from St. Louis to wisconsin, to indiana, to atlanta,
to NC, to maryland... and back to St louis.  I currently dont have on the
road e-mail capability but might take along my laptop just in case i run
into a willing phone jack.  Rub some oil into something as a way of saying
a prayer for me to the bus gods ;)
 
Had to do some last minute brakework last night (am here at white collar
office job with really greasy fingernails, heheh.) they were squaeling up
a storm and when i jacked it up the wheel would barely turn!  so i began
to disassemble the front brakes fearing i would need a caliper, be unable
to find one and thus have to rent a geo metro for my road trip (i dont
think id want to drive that many miles in that short of a time in anything
but my bus)  The pads were worn out and the calipers were overextended and
this  was causing the brakes to lock.  When i went to push one of the
pistons back it turned out to be STUCK!  after some fidgeting and trying
to wiggle the thing and use of a c clamp carefully (dont want to force it)
the frozen poiston popped free and started to work properly :)  don't try
this at home kids, buy professionally rebuilt brake parts (legal
disclaimer.)
 
i then put on 4 new pads, reassembled the bus, and bled the brakes... my
god the difference is astounding.  I have had this stuck piston over the
last 13k miles i think.. cant believe the night and day difference between
before and now with suck the brains out of your head braking capabilities!
also all 4 wheels dont heat up when on the highway... i think that the
reason ive been getting such crappy gas mileage is that one piston being
stuck was causign all the brakes to be partially on all the time. Probably
causd extra wear and tear on the engine fighting that drag too. 

so, im not going to upgrade to 73-79 disks.. i could lock these up at 100
(if my bus would go that fast.)  I will, however, save the parts for in a
few years... since you never know what availability of parts will be like
down the road i will always have the option to upgrade to the more
available brakes if i but keep the parts on a shelf.

Moral of the story: dont put of doing something that needs to be done!  i
cant believe i lived with this for a year when it took about 4 hours to
fix.  Brakes are important and even though my bus stopped fine, it never
felt right in the braking dept.  Now it is right and i am so happy.

so, i guess i get to teach by being an example of what NOT to do, i do now
know that any and every car i buy from now on is going to get a THOROUGH
going through the brakes and a grease and lube of everything soon after
purchase.

thanks for listening,

Steve

p.s. if you will be at any of the Phish concerts i will be driving a blue
and white 71 with missouri plates and orange and green curtains (yechh,
but it looks okay) and will be at the Phellowship table usually before
show, setbreak and aftershow. (unless im lucky and gets to go backstage)
