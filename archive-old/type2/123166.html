&gt; Can you use the &quot;Slammer Tool For Removing 46mm Axle Nut&quot;  from the

&gt; think Busdepot sells the same thing.  Will it fit onto a breaker bar?  
&gt; I cant seem to find a 46mm socket anywhere.

I've used big plumbers pipe wrenches to remove that nut for years with no
real damage to the nut.  long breaker bar on the end. the harder you push
the tighter it holds so not likely to break or come off

as always YMMV
