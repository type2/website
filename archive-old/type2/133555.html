Subject: RE: [T2] OT, friday VW follies?

today while cruising up I-95 in my bus I passed several minutes apart two
auto carriers full of new VW's, however on each carrier there was one
vehicle covered in a form fitting canas tarp, with the window areas cut
out so it could be driven without removeing the cover.  sort of looked
like a jetta sized station wagen under the tarps,  ???? anyone have a
clue.

Bob
