&gt; Hello everyone!
&gt;
&gt;      I just got a set of Vanagon alloy wheels(Thanks, Steve), so now I
&gt; need some longer wheel studs, off of a vanagon, So Does anyone have any
&gt; laying around they want to part with? Hay Ron(bus depot) do you have any
&gt; new? Nikki have you came across any in your finds?
&gt;
&gt;      Also will a rear hub off of a vanagon fit on my 79 bus? I'll need
&gt; all 20 studs. The salvage yards around here don't have any vanagon's.

Vanagon rear hubs will fit a newer bay. [not a large 5 68-70]
Vanagons were screwy.....they had nuts on the rear wheels and bolts on the
fronts.
