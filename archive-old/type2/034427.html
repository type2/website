	I forgot to put in my last post that I am in Olympia, Washington, also
someone asked about my tin plans, I am doing an upright conversion
because I'd rather slash up the tin than the car.  I am going with a kit
from an Australian company called Sharpbuilt, which consits of slasing up
the old fan shroud, and making the 914, or type 4, look like a stock
type2 engine.
