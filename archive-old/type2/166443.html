Hi Jim,

Thanks for the info! It makes me a bit happier knowing that it wasn't  
the timing that killed it.



Happy Trails,

The reason for my showing 27 degrees _at_ 3500rpm on the 205H (Actually  
205AH -
this is an error I will shortly correct) is that on all 411/412 Sedans &amp;
Wagons, timing is accomplished through a &quot;sight&quot; hole&quot; in the top of  
the fan
housing to the marks on the fan.  VW found that timing the 411/412 was
better at 3500rpm with the vacuum can disconnected/plugged.
