Subject: help with a pressure plate

volks,

i'm still in the process of putting my 69 beatle engine and i noticed that 
my pressure plate in the beatle is smaller than the bearing in the tranny. 
how do i pull the pins out of the bearing in the beatle engine to put in the 
tranny in the bus(72) and how do i remove the bearing out of thebus tranny?
any help would be awsome.
thanks
kenny
