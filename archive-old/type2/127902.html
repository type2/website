Subject: bosch hot start relay

Fellow listees

Yesterday my wife by mistake left the stereo on
in &quot;Orbin&quot; for about 6 hours. I figured a good run
across town today would be enough to charge the 
battery up. This was not the case. My wife had to
phone me to come with the jumper cables for a jump.
This worked and the wife was on her way to her next
stop. I decided to follow just in case. So this time
Orbin would not start again but with no click at all.
I checked the 15a fuse on the hot start relay and it 
had blown. I've had this bosch hot start relay for 
about a year with no problems. I also have it mounted
under my regulator inside my dry engine compartment.
After installing the new fuse I had to jump Orbin 
off again. I thought the wife would be good to go so 
I went back home. A few hours after she got home she
said she had to roll Orbin off each time she parked.
So I go to driveway and try to start Orbin up with 
no go. Damn, another blown fuse. I swithed the fuse 
for a new one and he fired right up. Does anyone think
that using jumper cables had anything to do with the
fuses blowing?? TIA
