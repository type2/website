&gt; I started looking for a proper can and found one in the Griot's catalog but
&gt; I'm don't want to pay their insane prices so I started looking for a similar

&gt; Has anyone bought one lately? I know they are heavy but it will be worth it

With years of experience with carrying gas around in cans for off-roading,
I've settled on using plastic tee-pee brand cans.  The metal cans are OK,
and the German style cans are superior to the American jerry cans, but
I've always had metal cans develop seam leaks after being in use for a
while.

Plastic cans take amazing amounts of abuse without leaking.  In fact, most
of my plastic gas cans were free, because I picked them up from the side
of the road after they were blown out of someone's dirt bike trailer at
speed  They suffer a few scratches, but as long as they aren't nailed by
another vehicle they are fine.

The real killer of plastic cans is sunlight.  If you keep then out of the
sun they last for years.  In the sun they will be cracking in a couple of
years.

If you have good gas cans you can get replacement spouts and caps from the
manufacturer, usually at relatively low prices.
