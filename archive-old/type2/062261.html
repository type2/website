&gt;Doesn't sound like a Westy to me, but what would I know?

westy's were built out of kombi's this one just happens to be missing 80%
of it's original westy interior

&gt;
&gt;I've got a '61 Weekender??? That's what I was told it was, anyhow.

very vague term, right up there w/ camper, IMHO westy's are worth more due
to the qualtiy of their construction and the fact that they were recognized
by VW as the only official conversion co. &quot;weekender&quot; ssounds like an
aftermarket conversion and consequently worth less

 I
&gt;purchased it for the unGodly sum of $100 about 2 weeks back.

hey can't argue w/ that :)

The
&gt;interior and exterior are complete, if not a little beat up. Bed is
&gt;there and working, the cabinets are all there (only in the rear of the
&gt;van), and though the seats are out of a Dasher (I think), it's all
&gt;original, except for the Safari Rear Window.


dunno what a Safari Rear Window.is
