From: Littljessica_at_aol_dot_com=20


dear friends of A.I.R.S.=20

the RedWoods are, for us, an opportunity to explore spontaneously back =
into nature and away (for a short time at least) from our burdening city =
life.=20
lately, the clock-governed stresses of living in a largely populated =
arena of  &quot;responsibilties and obligations&quot; have been taxing our hearts =
by driving us apart from each other, our focus inward to survive amongst =
one another behind shields of apathy and suspiscion is dominating our =
abilities to stop and actually appreciate the world we are striving to =
preserve....=20

i personally have never seen the RedWoods, and it defies my imagination =
when people tell me their stories of the enormity of them.  Right now =
there is a nomad inside of me that is in desperate need of leaving for a =
few days and seeing something new.  So, withing the next 24 hours, me =
and some friends intend to embark on what hopefully will be a truely =
&quot;soul-cleansing&quot; journey.=20

on Wed. 10 April around Noon-ish (the clock will not be our enemy here) =
we will leave Corona, Ca.=20

my friend Jessica (who owns the 1970 VW campmobile in which we are =
travelling) showed me the http://www.type2_dot_com website, to show that in =
the event of a difficulty we could find help through A.I.R.S.=20

we are not in trouble (and hopefully wont be anytime in our near future) =
however the gesture provided by those involved found a little part of me =
somewhere inside already in the peace i hope find to the north...and for =
that i would like to extend an invitation to those participating in =
A.I.R.S. (and anyone else who is in need) to join us, either by driving =
along side us or vicariously through corespondense, in our journey.=20

this trip is completely spontaneous in nature, in that we have no real =
schedule to burden us.  We put everything together at the last minute, =
which seems to feel right, and with luck others will join.  we intend to =
&quot;mosey&quot; to our destination, slow down and actually be a part of where we =
are going (and maybe be a better part of where we are now)....so this =
means we are totally free from obligation to anything but relaxing....=20

REMEMBER....i have never seen anything like the RedWoods before, this =
exploration is something i need to do, and this experience would be all =
the more rewarding if it could be shared with as much of the world as =
possible.  i will be seeking a new look at things, and my friends =
likewise have their own insights to find...=20

we feel there may be others who need this too...they should all join =
us....=20

what we are driving:  1970 VW microbus campmobile, white,=20
                                     with Van Gogh's &quot;Starry Night&quot; on =
the passenger's side=20
                               and -the nomadic Group &quot;W&quot; Bench=20
                                        Tree Observance Committee- =
behind the driver's door.=20

our intended route: 55 fwy ---&gt; Newport Beach ---&gt;turning North on PCH =
(1 fwy) ---&gt; and from there all the way up to Crescent City=20

when: leaving Corona, Ca _at_ Noon Wed. 10 April 2002=20

to contact us: (on the &quot;spontaneous road-trip hotline&quot;)=20
                        (909) 733-6657 -it's a cell phone so we'll be =
listening=20
                        ask for either Jessica or Craig=20
it would be memorable to have as much participation as possible from the =
world.....=20
thank you very much for the time....=20

i hope to see everyone and everything....=20
(please spread the word...remember spontanaity is our aim)=20
