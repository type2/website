Subject: Re: [T2] space heaters

From: &quot;Robert&quot; &lt;robtjm_at_sbcglobal_dot_net&gt;
&gt; ... It fits very nicely on the floor beneath the fold down bed, where it
can blow out into the central floor area but still be out of the way of
feet...

Watch those blankets.  We have an inordinate number of fires in this area
due to folks using heaters without watching what's hanging near them.  Hate
to see you and the family and the bus go poof.

BTW, I'm moving my domain to a new server.  Propagation is going to play
havoc with things for a little while.  Got tired of paying big bucks for
something that other companies offer for less.

Got tired of the site being down, too...
