Subject: Re: power, timing and distributors

&gt;I like my 009 that I inherited in my '69 camper.  Loads more power
&gt;than my '73
&gt;beetle, even tho the bug had a rebuilt motor.  All stock otherwise.  One
&gt;question, tho- Where to time it?!? I'me getting mixed signals
&gt;here folks!  20, 35, 7.5, depends on mex or german manufacture, etc.
&gt;Muir sez 7.5 for all 009.  Others say 20 for mexican 009, 35 for ge
&gt;rman parts. I am thoroughly confoozed.

        Maximum 32 degrees  AT FULL ADVANCE. This means no more than 32
degrees of advance at maximum RPMs. Less will get you less efficnecy and
less heat, more will fry your engine.

Peace,
