David,
  Thanks for your advice! Very valuable info to keep in mind. Another option I was considering was stock 68 rims. BFY has them in stock, but how do I know if the PO's blunders didn't include  changing the whole suspension? The lug pattern doesn't seem that wide to me, but then again I'm kind of new to VW's.

Peace &amp; Harmony
