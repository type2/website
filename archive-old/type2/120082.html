Subject: star adjusters..

Can't get 'em loose!  any suggestions?  Is it OK to spray PB Blaster in there or will I soak the shoes?  Of course I'm hoping to get them out anyway.  Should the drums slide off without loosening the stars?  They don't- the stars are my only hope.
Please Help!  -Chris  73 Westy
