Subject: &quot;A house on your back&quot;

 One of my Gurus is a man by the name of Colin Fletcher. (I hope)

 He wrote a book called &quot;The Compleate Walker&quot; (not sure on the compleate as
to last &quot;e&quot;).

 He is a Back-packer. No, he is &quot;The Back-packer&quot;.

 He hiked Death Valley , The Grand Canyon, several mountain ranges etc. That
and write is all he does.

 These trips take months at a time.

 He of course carries everything on his back in a pack.

 One of the chapters in the book mentioned above is titled &quot; A house
on your back&quot;.

 There are sub-categories like &quot;the kitchen&quot;.

 He has complete check-lists of items to carry in your pack.
 What the Old Ones called their &quot;possibles&quot;.
 Meaning they might possibly need it.
 
 There are of course different check-lists for different areas.

 He is a stickler for weight. Nothing should weigh more than a minimum
and should have at least two uses.

 Cuts the borders off maps, tears the tabs off the tea bags.

 On the Death Valley trip his cooking gear was 2 tin cans because of
his water requirements. (He and Bob went to different schools together)

 Everything else is in shapeless baggies to take up the least space.

 Go by the library and check it out.

 You not only will be more confident off the highway on camping trips but
you'll rattle around in your van like you had a four story mansion.
