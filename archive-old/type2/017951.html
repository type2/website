When Tobin and Christa Copley bought a '76 Deluxe in San Diego it had
severe windshield channel rust, and it was addressed by a shop in San
Diego called Omar's -- it LOOKED great. But Tobin said that when they
got it back to Vancouver the water POURED in, screwing up the
electronics, et cetera. DAMN!

That was a big disappointment. They didn't FIX the problem, they made it
look good. Maybe it's a San Diego thing (competence is not too common
here), but I'd hit it with a stream of water from a garden hose before I
parted with the cash, make sure the fix is a real fix and not a
supermarket apple.
