Hello All,

I have a complete dual carb set up off of a 72 bus with carbs, linkage,
and stock air cleaner.  I'd really like to trade for a single carb set
up or make me an offer.  A progressive Weber would be great.  

Also, does anyone know if there is a synchronous two barrel carb kit for
these later type 2 engines?
