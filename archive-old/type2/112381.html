Subject: Leaky windshield seal

Well, the rains have finally come to San Francisco, and today while 
running some errands I noticed a leaky spot on the top of the 
windshield seal basically right above the horn button.

I was afraid this was going to happen; there is a gap at the top of the 
seal on the outside where it appears as though the glass/seal have 
&quot;sagged&quot;.  The windshield is not the original; it was replaced some 
time in the past (how long ago, I don't know).

I'm not particularly interested in replacing the seal right now.  What 
I'd like to do is skate along until I get the Bus painted (which I'd 
like to do in about a year or so), at which time I'll deal with all the 
various body nits (including rust repair under the windshield seal).

So, I'm inclined to use some sort of black silicone-type material to 
patch the leak until I'm ready to do all the body work.  Does anyone 
have any recommendations?  Just plain GE black?  I'll want something 
that'll be removable with a reasonable amount of effort.

Also, I'm curious what would cause this &quot;sagging&quot;.  Maybe glass that 
isn't quite the right size?  Just a crappy seal?  Would a picture help? 
:-)

Thanks!
