Subject: re:St. Muir

    
&gt;    Many of us are greatly indebted to the musings of John Muir and his profound=
&gt;    writings on VW repair, many of us have also cautioned each other on the=
&gt;    errors that Mr. Muir included in his writings. 
  
The ones that come to mind --

Buy the 36mm socket. I can't imagine driving an engine that has had
2 r&amp;r's by the cold chisel method.

Muir doesn't have a good grasp of the concept of electricity -- look to
other sources for troubleshooting, especially the charging system.

Muir views the automatic choke as a plot foisted upon us by the
military/industrial complex. 

I started working on the bus (and my old bug) with Muir, but I find
I don't use it much anymore -- part of which may have to do with the fact
that I've got most of it memorized.  Muir says many good things about
the &quot;karma&quot; of owning a VW, but I find I use Bentley most of the 
time now.

Of course, the best advice I could give is to read 2 or 3 sources, and
do what makes the most sense.
