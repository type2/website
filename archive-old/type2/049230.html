Subject: [T2] Re: vacuum gauges

I've got one too.  It is Tee'd into the metal part of the vacuum booster line 
about halfway between manifold and brake servo.  

The &quot;pulsations&quot; (where there were none before) alerted me to a burned #3 
exhaust valve.  Saved me some bucks.  

It also helps with MPG since vacuum is roughly equivalent to air/fuel ratio 
(definitely not stoichiometric, though).
