If you adjust those any so that they squirt past the &quot;butterfly&quot; without
hitting it,
make sure you use a screwdriver and small hammer and tap it down tight
into it's socket.  It is not screwed in but rather pressed in.  I have
heard of
people adjusting them and then they just disappear.  The only thing you
will notice is that it won't run as smooth.  You'll never hear it eat
the jet.
