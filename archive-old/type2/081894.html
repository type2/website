&gt; All this talk of T4 buses has me scared witless... It
&gt; took 6 hours with me and a guy that works on american
&gt; cars to pull and install a T2 engine in a 68 Westy.  I
&gt; have a chance to buy a pair of T4 buses, one needs to
&gt; have the engine/trans of the other.  I am not sure
&gt; that I am up the the task of swapping the T4s... I
&gt; guess if I buy, then I will learn.  Thanks for the
&gt; posts on this topic, it is educational.

There is at least one lady on this list
( and i suspect others )  who have made
significant intricate repairs to their late bay
engines with minor encouragement and
with successful results.
Perhaps with a little more encouragement,
they will post their questions and results.
