Subject: Re: [T2] Mystery Wire on 72

THis could be for the Vacuum Advance Cutoff.  This is connected to a switch 
on the transmission that looks like the reverse lights switch and is supposed 
to be connected in the engine compartment to a temperature switch.    This 
switch is supposed to, and I'm quoting from Bently here, do this:  &quot;Except in 
fourth gear, the vacuum advance is cutoff whenerver the air temperature is 
above 12 C (54 F).  This means that the vacuum advance is only effective in 
fourth gear and in all other gears at temperatures below 12C (54F).&quot;

I can't tell you what the color of this wire is since it was missing from 
mine when I bought it.

Hope this helps!

&gt; I have found a mystery wire on the 72 deluxe I am
&gt;  working on. It is Gray and one end leads into the
&gt;  engine compartment, the other end is connected to the
&gt;  front of the transmission, however it is NOT the wire
&gt;  for the back up lights, those two wires connect to the
&gt;  tranny on the left side, this one is connected just
&gt;  forward of these wires. I cannot find this wire on the
&gt;  wiring diagram I have, and this wire is NOT present on
&gt;  either my 71 or my 79.
&gt;  So anyone know what it is?
