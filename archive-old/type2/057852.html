Subject: Locating Mark Strenzk in Canada

I apologize for posting this to the entire list, but does anyone who did
not delete this already based on the off-bus-content subject know of Mark
Strenzk in Canada?  His email address was mstrenzk_at_niagra_dot_com, but the
latest email bounced back.

I was going to buy a fuse panel from his for my Westy, we were talking back
and forth for several days, then it is like he fell off the face of the
earth.  No contact in over a month and now the emails bounce.

Thanks for any help

1970 Campmobile, produced on the day L.H. Oswald was shot.  (Pretty
interesting IMO)
