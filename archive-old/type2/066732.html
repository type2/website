Subject: Re: Ball Joint Thread Continued

I have two ball jt. boots on my 78 camper which are torn- I used a needle
greaser on my greas gun to fill/flush the joint, wiped it well, wrapped it
with polyethylene plastic, then wrapped that with polyethelene tape.  When
I grease the front end, I reuse the needle.  The idea is to keep dirt/grit
out, and joint will last a long time.
