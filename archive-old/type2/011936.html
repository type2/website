It's after market in my 1980 Westy.  Mine is a fairly
nice unit that somehow crammed the evaporator under
the dash.  The compressor (mounted right above the
exhaust manifold) keeps leaking, however, so it's hard
to keep it working.  I think these systems used a
unique sized pulley on the AC, so if you have a chance
let me know the size of the pulley on your compressor.
 Any guess how long we'll be able to get R12?
