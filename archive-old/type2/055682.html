You can tell how many messages have been posted to this list on a given day
by examining this headerfield:

&gt;X-Mailing-List: &lt;type2_at_bigkitty.azaccess_dot_com&gt; archive/latest/121

That last number rolls back to zero at midnight US Mountain time, when the
day's messages are sent off to the archive where the web search engine can
probably never find them again from then on. 8) With a few minutes left to
go we'll see over 120 today; Thursday is our most prolific day most weeks.

I am not bitching about the bandwidth. There are slivers I would like to
see shaved but by and large our bandwidth use is very intelligent, for a
recreational list it is surprising, for an automotive list it really is
astonishing. If you think otherwise you haven't been on very many
automotive lists. 8) My compliments to the Folk, sincerely, nobody else can
do this but you.

There are just too many Westies in the campsite, if you know what I mean,
and we're discussing where to put everybody if it turns out we need
additional campgrounds. It had to happen someday. We'll handle it and we'll
try to do it well and if you want to weigh in send me pmail. If that's too
cryptic it means you haven't been here long enough to weigh in. 8)

Meanwhile just, please, think before you speak, I don't have a problem with
any particular thread but don't post two messages if you could post one and
don't post &quot;two cents' worth&quot;, post a dollar instead.
