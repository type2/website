Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Mike's Poptop Page

Larry - 
The reason that I decided and still think the best way is to install the 
bottom of the canvas first with the screws is the exact reason that is being 
discussed now by Ron and others,... if you staple the top first, and 
especially if you fold it over like you're &quot;supposed to&quot;, when you have it 
all stapled along the top you might just find that there is not enough 
material to work with in order to stretch it beneath the metal brackets on 
the roof of the bus. Also, it is possible that it is easier to stretch it 
(requiring a second party) while stapling then to stretch it while screwing 
(although there are beads on both top and bottom to aid in the stretching). 
Just my opinion, I haven't tried it your way so I just don't know. In any 
case, much of the info that is on my site is an accumulation of info from 
archived type2_dot_com posts, where you will find both varieties of opinions. Its 
up to the installer if she wants to take a chance or not. Not me, I paid a 
pretty penny for that canvas and I'm not going to compromise its integrity 
(besides, with a little creative thought, you can come up with a neat way to 
cover up those unsightly staples!!).
