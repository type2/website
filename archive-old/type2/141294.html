Subject: Re: [T2] Since the trip to Cali is off...

I second the drive to Estes Park.  Although not in the bus, we drove 34 all 
the way through that portion of the Rocky Mountain National Park a few days 
ago.  It's a bit of a drive, and get's up to around 12k feet.  One of the 
most beautiful drives I have been on.  Also the first time I have seen a 
mature evergreen standing about 2 feet tall  :)

&gt;&gt; you can still camp.  there are plenty of campsites open year round.  the
&gt; national park camp sites are mostly open year round.  just bring your own
&gt; heat as it generally is much colder in estes park than down where we are.
&gt; the bear lake region of the national park is another 1000-1500 feet in
&gt; elevation above estes and gets even colder.
