Subject: left heater cable

hi list - why does the left heater cable never want to come out form me.
i'm breaking down a 68 parts bus and once again i am stumped on that cable.
seems like the tube in the rear is smaller, and the metal bit at the end it
the cable never wants to pass through that tube. a yank on it it and it
jams up. opposite effect on the right side. heavens-to-betsy if i do get it
out and i have to re-install someday. someone share the trickery?  - steve
