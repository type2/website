Subject: Re: [T2] rust removal &amp; paint job???

&gt; ok, so currently my 76 Westy is wearing only primer.... it looked alright
when i bought it, but now it has been raining often and some of the surface
rust is starting to return. ... plan to do this myself. what should i use to
get the rust off?

I get 3m clean&amp;strip disks, which are just tough scotchbrite disks.  I grind
off the little plastic mountings that come on them, drill a hole in the
center, and use them in my cutoff grinder.  I also get the same kind of
disks epoxied to 5&quot; makita-type angle grinder disks, made by a company
called SAIT.  I get these from my auto paint store, and the SAIT disks from
a professional tool store.

Best things by far that I have ever used.  Paint and rust gone fast, no
damage to metal.

Regards,

Grant
