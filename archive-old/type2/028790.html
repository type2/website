Importance: Normal

&gt; A storm last night appears to have knocked out 3 of our 5
&gt; incoming lines.  Until we get it fixed, all calls are funnelling
&gt; into just 2 lines, so you may experience busy signals. Please be
&gt; patient if calling - or better yet, use the website or email
&gt; sales_at_busdepot_dot_com instead.  Hopefully the situation will be
&gt; corrected sometime today.


We now have 4 of our 5 phone lines back up; the 5th one won't be fixed until
sometime Monday. So while we're still not at 100%, the situation is greatly
improved.  Turns out the storm fried one of the two main switchboxes that
routes our calls, so we're &quot;winging it&quot; with a bunch of cordless phones
until the new part arrives on Monday.  :-(

Incidentally, I'll be out of town thru late Sunday, so I probably won't be
checking email until then (unless I'm fortunate enough to be able to connect
via my cell phone and laptop; which tends to be hit or miss). Of course,
most correspondence should go to Jerry at sales_at_busdepot_dot_com anyway, and
he'll be working as usual (as will the whole crew at the shop).

Evon, 3 year old Haley, and I will be at the Grassroots Music Festival in
Trumansburg NY (www.grassrootsfest_dot_org).  If you go, stop by and say hi.
We'll be in the main camping area - usually parked in a &quot;circle&quot; of 4
Westies with side tents.  If you are anywhere remotely near the Ithaca NY
area, make the trip to the festival; it's well worth it!
