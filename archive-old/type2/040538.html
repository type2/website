Subject: camping tent question

I have an orange tent to match Polly with 2 doors (the tent not the van).  I
am trying to convince my mother in law - who can sew anything to manufacture
some king of link to sew on the end of the tent.  The benefit of owning a
bus is that it is made of steel (well some  of it) so the tent can clamp to
the bus with magnets.
