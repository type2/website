Subject: Re: [T2] 68-71 Bus' have upright motors, but can you&gt;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt; 
&gt; I know these are upright motors, but what is the
&gt; difference (if any) from a Type 1 motor..??
&gt; 
&gt; Otherwords, can you simply take a motor from a bug and
&gt; bolt it right up to your bus??
&gt; 
&gt; The only thing i can think of that would be different
&gt; is the bottom motor bracket..  &gt;&gt;

Even if you don't have a type 1 case with factory fittings 
for the rear hanger bar, there are adaptors - not the per-
fect solution by far but I used a Bug engine in my '71 for
years...Monthly checking and tightening helps a lot to
keep a daily driver drivin' daily...
