---When you remove the ground cable and then go to put
it back on... are you seeing a small spark jump? If so
then there is to much current being drawn. Is
everything turned off? If you have a aftermarket
radio/cd player it will draw current to keep the
memory active.. but very little..
  Spark or no spark you need to do what Karl wrote
(below).
If you arent familure with a VOM then you might want
to
look at this..

If you see current being drawn then start taking fuses
out one at a time and see if removing one of them
makes
the current flow stop. That will tell you which ckt 
has either a problem or a device like your CD player
which requires constant voltage for memory. But you
are looking for a higher current draw than what a CD
player alone draws.

  Good luck!
------------------------ 
&quot;&quot;The more accurate way to test for a drain is to set
your test meter to DC milliamps. Connect it between
the negative terminal and the negative post. Anything
more than 100 ma will slowly drain the battery. A dome
light on is about 300 ma.....
A digital clock will show a 12v drain but only about 5
ma. That will take about a 3 months to make a fully
charged go completely flat.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
