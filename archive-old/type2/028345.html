Subject: Mfiche Owners ('77): Part # Needed

If any of you have access to microfiche, could you let me know what the part number for the outlet/inlet at the base of the fuel tank (circa '77) is. Also, if there are dimensions available, I need to determine if this part is a screw-on fit into my '72 tank. (I'm converting to FI and need a return fuel fitting.)

Otherwise, I'll look for a local junker with a fuel tank in place...or last resort fabricate something on my VERY DRY '72 tank (has been empty for years with no fuel smell remaining in it; although I've seen profound warnings against drilling on or using fire on tanks, I seriously doubt any explosive qualities remaining in this tank).

Thanks! Joe
