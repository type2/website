Subject: Re: [T2] 79 Cali dist

Sorry, your mechanic is wrong. You have to use the correct coil. Go get a
68 -79 Bentley. Section 5, page 78. 20.1 Special coil.
&quot;The basic description of coil operation, installation, and maintenance given
in 19.1 Coil applies equally to the special coil installed on vehicles with
breakerless transistorized ignitions. However, under no circumstances should a
coil other than VW part # 211 905 115C be used with the breakerless
transistorized system.&quot;

And where are you going to get the special harness between the module and the
distributor??

Before you go back to him, get a 80 - 85 Vanagon Bentley, go to page 28.8.
Except for the idle stabilizer and the dist. drive at the bottom, THESE are
all the parts you NEED to make this swap
work. Sorry, you cannot piece together standard ignition parts with this
system.

Perhaps if he distrusts list info, maybe he will believe the info in the
Bentley.

&gt; This saturday I'm getting and installing my 79 Calif distributor in my 78
&gt; stock 2L. I am getting it from my mechanic who agreed with the list that it
&gt; was the best option out there. Karl offered me one of these also, and gave
&gt; me install instructions. The advantage of getting it from my mechanic is I
&gt; get to drive over, install it myself at his place and he will help if
&gt; needed. I have 2 questions:
&gt;
&gt; My mechanic said the stock coil will work fine, while Karl  said a Bosch
&gt; electronic coil from the donor bus or a Rabbit is required. Will the stock
&gt; coil work at all, but with a shorter life? I hate argueing with my mechanic
&gt; as he totally distrusts the info I get from the list, and that's all I have
&gt; to go on. Generally I trust him, he is very traditional, keep the FI and
&gt; heater flaps kind of german mechanic that specializes in busses and
&gt; Vanagons.
&gt;
&gt; Repair parts to be carried? This is replacing an OEM dist with Pertronix
&gt; and I carried a set of points and coil as repair parts. Karl says I can get
&gt; the ignition module and coil from a Rabbit or Audi so I guess I will get
&gt; those. Anything else that can go without warning? Should I carry a spare
&gt; dist and coil?
