Subject: Brake light fuse

Shawn...
    Now that you've used all those fuses, make up a test light from one
of them.  Solder wires to the end caps, then connect the wires to the
socket of a BRAKE light bulb (use one of the brass shell type)...BOTH of
the buttons.  This can be put
in the fuse location for testing purposes, wont blow, and protects
things because it is a 12 volt bulb.  Current is high enough it will run
many small accessories, and yet protects the wiring against shorts.
Made the first of these for my 57 Bug, and used them since.

So here's an update on the brake light fuse.

Spent all afternoon tracing wires, checking grounds, killing the
battery,  charging
battery, burning finger on fuse as it blew, replacing headlight switch,
tail light
assemblies (Brazilian until I find some good OEM ones), swearing, etc...

The last thing I decided to check was the fuse panel itself.  I removed
the screws,
turned it around and lo and behold, fried wires so bad that they were
melted to one another. (terminals 11&amp; 12) Unstuck them and tried the
fuse, (my last good one), crossed my fingers and stepped on the
pedal...  Brake Lights!!!

I surly would have smelled that meltdown if I was driving.  I think it
was like that for years and it finally decided to start acting up.  Now
I have the ardous task of replacing all those melted wires.  Not looking
foreward to that but I know I have to.  Another day...

Thanks for the help volks.  Yes the problem was before the switches on
the Master Cylinder.
