Subject: VW Microfiche at Auction

A couple of years ago I sold one of my sets of VW factory Parts Catalogs
on microfiche through the VW lists.  Finances now force me to liquidate my
remaining set.  Previously I sent a list of the fiche to interested
parties and sold to first come/first served.  Being broke, I'm going for
the $$ (and more people will have a chance for them) by posting on the
eBay auction site.

Go to  http://pages.ebay_dot_com/aw/search.html  and do a seller search on
Deluxe64_at_aol_dot_com -- you'll see the current listed auctions.  More fiche
will be posted as time allows (including all models up to 1993).

Thanks.
