Subject: Re: [T2] Heat: Atwood Bilge Blower?

From: &quot;Chris Mills&quot; &lt;busbodger_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Also and more importantly if there are any leaks in the system and any CO
floating around the leaks - that bildge blower up from is going to suck the
fumes into the system and deposit them inside with you.

Which is why mine is going into the spare wheel well in the back of my '77
bay.  I'll have it sucking fresh air from inside the bus and blowing into
the stock fan housing (with the fan removed, mine is shot anyway) via a
cutout and ducted through the wall of the wheel well.

With the well insulated and the blower covered with an insulated cover, I
hope to reduce the noise from the blower a bit.  I also plan on a &quot;speed&quot;
switch to govern the blower's output.
