&lt;&lt; does a 30PICT-3 have this dreaded plug?? where and what is it?  thanks!

If this plug comes out, you can replace it with a dime. I did this once
about 6 years ago. Had to file the rim of the dime just a bit, then with
some epoxy to hold it in place and seal it (not too much, of course), I
wedged the dime in the hole. The carb still works great. It is a 30 PICT-3.
