&gt;Actually, I know that the holes in the doors are aftermarket, but I like
the idea of going stock. So here is the question....Do the original German
radios use speakers that I could put in those holes??
&gt;

I believe the Type II's only had a single dash speaker mono system. Others
will correct me if I'm wrong. Later Vanagons would have door speakers that
might just fit. And some of the deluxe modles will have a system with rear
speakers. I'm not sure those radios will fit the dash without cutting,
though. Check with Crutchfield or other Blaupunckt dealer for a new stereo
system that can, alas, be custom fitted. A stock system and a boom box for
stereo needs might be cost effective. All you then need do is put the boom
box and stock radio on the same station, then remove the boombox at will
and be stock if and when you want.
