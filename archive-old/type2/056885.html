Subject: '61 Westy, sub-hatch rescue

Got a lead of some &quot;for sale&quot; site, said '57Westy f/s, no engine,needs
work, all there, best offer.
I didn't know if the guy was in NJ, WA, USSR,...
turns out he was 2 hours away!   I emailed him and asked if best offer
meant $100 of $10,000?   He says $300, rummm, rummm my engine starts up as
we were finishing the conversation.
I get there and there it was, in plain view, lots of character an in need
of a little metal messaging (my favorite)
Interior trashed but enought was there for making patterns
front floors looked like orange corn flakes, tail light and emblem hiding
under front seat.   We negotiated a little and he gave me his pink paper
for my green paper.

BIG QUESTION:  HELP, INPUT NEEDED

I have done lots of sheetmetal work, cutting fabricating welding etc...
My question is, not how to put a front floor in ,but does a good one exist
in the after market?  Where and what modifications should I expect?

thanks, rex
