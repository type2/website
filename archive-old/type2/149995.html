FWIW, you can get any rotor cross-drilled through several aftermarket
companies (most are located at the back of Car Magazines like Road &amp; Track
and Automobile). This would make a HUGE difference in performance for a
reasonable price.

Jon

&gt; Hal, what about rotor clearance etc?  I've been researching some of the
&gt; European's solutions to this problem.  They seem to have more options
&gt; available, at least according to a book I bought last spring.  Sorry -- I'm
&gt; moving, the book is packed away, I don't recall the name although I wrote of
&gt; it here at the time.  A 4 piston or even plain old ventilated rotor would be
&gt; a huge step up.  Last time I took the Bus down to Pine Creek in north
&gt; central Pennsy, the front brakes were smoking on the incline.
