Subject: Everybus pics

Here are the pics from Everybus 2002. Thanks to all who sent and are sending
pics. I will update the site regularly as pics come in so check back.

http://www.72camper_dot_com/eb2002.htm

I will be offering ALL the pics I receive from others, plus all of my pics
in full size (3 times larger than the full sized versions on the website)
for this year's Everybus and ALL of the pics from last year's Everybus on cd
soon. I couldn't put all of the pics on my site, but you can see them on the
cd. It will be a non-profit effort. Only charging for the cost of the cd and
shipping. E-mail me if you are interested. I will sell these at the campouts
too.

Thanks,

Rob Henley
