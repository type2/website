Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 down to a 1200?

Heh, thanks for all the feedback.

I have scrapped the 1200 idea and found a place where I can get a used
1600cc longblock for $300...

which will do me until I can redo the original motor.

Anyone want a 1200cc from a 66 Type 1? ;)

&gt; hello Guys  I have done this changeover a bunch.  As said you will need
&gt; the adapter plate for the crossbar and you will have to machine the 12 volt
&gt; flywheel to fit the 6 volt crank in the 1200. You can do this on a common
&gt; brake lathe and it requires you to remove the outter lip of the flywheel
&gt; where it connects to the crankshaft. You will have to use a paper or metal
&gt; gasket on the end of the crankshaft as was done with the 1200 motor anyway.
&gt; you can't use the flywheel o ring as in the 12 volt flywheel  later  Mark
