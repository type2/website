Subject: Re: [T2] newbie repairing totaled bus

In California if your car is &quot;totaled&quot; but you opt to keep the vehicle, the
state issues you a special salvage title only after you've had the brakes
and lamps inspected at a licensed inspection station to the tune of $250 -
$3000

&gt; &gt; if you are &quot;buying it back&quot; from the insurance company you will probably
get
&gt; &gt; a salvage title which might make it harder to sell later........
&gt;
&gt; Since this is just a financial transaction with the insurance company, you
&gt; still have the same title you've always had.  The check you get from the
&gt; insurance company is just smaller since they deducted what they
&gt; considered the &quot;salvage value&quot; from the total.
