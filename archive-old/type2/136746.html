I had the same experience. They either didn't want to do it because it wasn't an insurance claim, or because it was an old VW or both. One place that turned me down even had an 80-83 Vanagon in their shop and tried to tell me they didn't do VWs.

All the VW resto shops were interested but their prices were astronomical. I looked for 6 months until I found the right place. Many places that wanted to do the work scared me to death with their sloppy work, lowball price estimates, their dirty workplace and lack of paint facilities!
