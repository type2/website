Subject: Spray nozzel

This question is directed at Richard Atwell. On your website where you are 
painting your Bus and the guys were using some kind of special nozzel to 
paint the vents at the rear of the bus, what kind of special nozzel are you 
talking about so I can do the same here in the near future?
