Subject: musings on temp readings, gauges etc.
Content-Language: en

I've noted several recent threads discussing temps, pressures etc.  I was 
seriously considering what sounds like the same sort instrumentation 
referenced, but am now wondering??

It seems a lot of this anecdotal evidence supports what the Bergs state they 
found with their research on the less expensive gauges available.  

What should we be looking for to get reliable information?  It sounds like I 
could sink several hundred dollars into gauges and senders that won't tell me 
much more than the oil light and my fingertips!!!

A post on the vintag list says to buy airplane gauges.  Any thoughts?

&lt;&lt;Why We Don't Sell Gauges â€” Technical Info

                  Most Gauges Are &quot;Horrible&quot;

I hear daily of engines being destroyed by people relying on gauges.
I have run hundreds of accuracy tests on practically every
inexpensive aftermarket gauge under $125 offered. Practically all
read low in the 212 to 260 degree range by 40 to 50 degrees on oil
temperature and head temperature gauges in the 250 to 550 degree
reading range, again being low by as much as 250 or more degrees.
I tested about twenty each of most brands such as VDO, Smith,
Stewart Warner, Hawk, etc., and found none without these
problems.

Oil temperature gauge readings would be 212 to 220 degrees on
the gauge when the true test temperature was 240 to 260 degrees.
Head temperature gauges read 385 degrees with a true test
temperature of 550 plus degrees. When head test temperatures
were upped to 700 degrees, the reading of the gauge went up to 390
to 395 degrees. The price range of such gauges was from $60 to
$125. I swapped gauges with senders and got different readings. I
found nothing in that price range I would wish on my worst enemy.
Not one I tested could ever be properly calibrated or relied on in
any way for any valid information or even as a comparison from day
to day on the air cooled VW.

Yes, even the oil pressure gauges
were just as bad. I found good accurate gauges range from about
$250 to $350 and few people would buy them. What was needed was
a device that gave the information required and was reasonably
priced. That was the reason for the GB 227 in the first place. It is
specifically made and calibrated to provide an accurate reading in
the ranges of the VW air cooled engine. Originated by Hal Brown in
1972. Made in the USA.

Note: If you must install an oil pressure gauge use GB 264-1/8 tee
fitting and GB 265-1/8 pipe nipple to install the factory (Bosch
VWA021-919-081B) light sending unit and the gauge together as
the factory sender and light are over 100 times as fast to tell you if
you run out of oil. Never use any sender that has the pressure and a
light combination as they are extremely slow and you lose the rapid
action that the factory light sender provides. 

Warning: If you want gauges as a decoration fine, but never rely on
them. After all, if they provided reliable information I would be
selling them to make a profit just like our competition.&gt;&gt;
