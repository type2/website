Subject: [T2] Accurately calculating bus milage?

The bus is a 1967 model with correct 14&quot; rims and a stock 10.6 gallon tank. Tire size is 14R185/70.

That is about all the bus content for the post so you may want to delete now.

&gt;From time to time the issue of gas mileage in an old bus comes up on the list. I must confess that I have been a bad bus driver and never carefully calculated my MPG. Recently I thought it would be interesting to pinpoint MPG in order to see how effective my tune-ups are.

In order to be accurate there are some issues that must be addressed.

1) Exactly how much gas am I using? Assuming the gas pump is ACCURATELY telling me how much I have pumped I can start there. I filled up the bus to a notable point in the filler neck and noted the odometer reading. Upon my next fill up (which I hope will be in about 250 statute miles) I will fill up to the same point noting amount put in the tank and current odometer reading. A little math and I have my MPG, right?

2) Is my odometer reading true? I don't think so. I am currently running 14/185/70 which is undersized in comparison to the original tires to which I assume the odometer/speedometer is calculated. I do not know how to correct for tire size. Is there a simple factor I can plug in? 

If you know how to solve the problem please let me know.

Chris
