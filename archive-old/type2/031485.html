&gt; GOt a question for the engineers on the list.  will the integrity of my
&gt; bus be ruined if i cut out the pass reaar corner on my bus without somehow
&gt; bracing it?  i.e. will the bus flex so as to make it difficult to fit the
&gt; new corner? this is on a 78 westy removing the entire corner piece and
&gt; battery tray

I wouldn't drive it like that, but it shouldn't be a problem while working
on it, I plan on doing the same thing as soon as I get a corner and the
time
