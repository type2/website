Subject: refirbishing EGR filter, One question

Hello list,

I bought a used EGR filter recently and decided to
refirbish it. First, I unpluged the inside of both
pipes that lead from the box. I could easily blow
through it then. I then took some copper scouring pads
and pulled them apart. I used scisors to cut the light
copper &quot;chainmale&quot; into small enough sections to
insert in the filter. I put a total of 3 scouring pads
inside the filter. I can still blow through the filter
with ease but this brings me to my question. What is
to keep the small particles of the scouring pad from
being sucked into the engine? Will this pose a
problem?  I am going to use an air nozzle to blow
through the filter to try and remove any loose tiny
particles but is this somthing to be conserned about?
I plan to change my oil once a month obsessively. Will
this help? I just don't want to install somthing that
could considerly lower the life of my rebuild. Any
thoughts would be appreciated!

Thanks!
