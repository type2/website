Subject: Weird stuff happening

Hello All!
My '78 is finally running after three weeks idle because I was sure my dizzy 
had bitten the dust. After charging the battery, I started it one morning 
only after my wife's Pontiac had a broken brake line making it unsuitable to 
drive for me. I timed the engine this time with a timing light and not by my 
40% deaf ears, it ran fine until a few days later, when she said NO MORE and 
I noticed that the timing was about 2 degrees too far advanced (about 9.5 
BTDC), a defect that I corrected. Now the timing is correct, but she still 
lacks the power that she had a few months ago when last she ran. I also 
experience backfiring upon decelleration, espcially when the engine is 
really warmed up(like after about 45 minuet driving time). Anyone have any 
ideas? would appreciate the help.
Howard
'78 Sevenseater(Lilli-Marlene)
