Subject: Re: [T2] Debugging an Engine that's running Hot 

Tom,

If you have the '71 bettle left intake manifold end, I would reccomend
using that very strongly!  It may bobble a bit more than a centrally
located port, but it is certain to be manifold vacuum!

Note to everyopne else:  My '71 super beetle came with a throttle
positioner.  The vacuum source for that was a port on the left end casting
of the intake manifold.  Not all left ends had this port... I have no idea
which do and which do not, but if you have one, that's a fine place to
attach a vacuum gauge!  If you had a throttle positioner, then you likely
had the port on your original engine, but 30 years down the road... who
knows?
