Hello-

I have purchased a new Thunderbird muffler and a replacement EGR filter for
my '76 bus. Upon quick inspection under the bus, there seems to be something
(I believe its a tube for the heater fan to force air into the heater box)
in the way. I searched the archives, and saw that the repro'ed EGR filters
(part no. 021 131 617F) is the correct part for the California model, but
...617E is the correct part for the federal model (like mine). Has anyone
modified theirs to fit? Do I have to remove that heater tube?

If anyone has experience/knowledge/advice with this, please let me know...

Thanks!

Jeff
