&gt; Has anyone used those 4-point firing

&gt; they increase gas mileage and feel
&gt; like more horsepower.

A larger electrode surface has a greater capacitance and will allow a
greater voltage to build up before discharge.  A conventional ignition
system needs those large electrodes to get a decent spark from the coil.

Those tiny platinum electrodes work well with a modern ignition system
designed for them, but they will produce weaker sparks in a VW.

Save your money!
