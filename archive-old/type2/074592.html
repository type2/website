Subject: Type IV oil cooler on a type 1 motor

Just for the record, a type IV oil cooler will fit a type 1 motor (with a 
doghouse shroud) with a few modifications.  You need to replace the 3 oil 
cooler mounting studs with the longer ones from a type IV.  And you need to 
modify the doghouse shroud to fit over it.  The best way is to cut the shroud 
and weld in a little more material (or use fiberglass if you're not a welder).  
But I know from experience that you can shove a couple of 2x4's into the oil 
cooler area and beat the snot out of them.  This will have the ugly effect of 
tearing the metal, but RTV red silicone is an amazingly versatile filler :) 
(Rube Goldberg eat your heart out.)

Why would you want to do this?  Simple.  The type IV cooler is 25% larger than 
the type 1 cooler.  Does this actually cool your engine better?  I don't know.  
Does that annoyingly loud stinger exhaust on the neighbor's punk kid's Honda 
make it go faster?  He'll say yes.  You make the call....
