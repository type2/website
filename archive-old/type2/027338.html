After rebuilding and installing my fuel injected 2.0, i have run into a 
slight problem(ha).  The engine starts up fine, but when i put the car into 
gear and try to accelerate, it dies on me.  Then the car needs to sit for a 
couple of minutes before it starts up again.  I have already ruled out the 
possiblity that i cant drick stick, where do i go from here?
thanks.
