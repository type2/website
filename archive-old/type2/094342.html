&gt; Can I safely take the seal off and leave it without one for a week or so?  I
&gt; would like to get the rust and crud cleaned out before the new seal gets
&gt; here.  There are also a couple of shows I am going to this weekend and I
&gt; really don't like popping the top and having three feet of seal hanging all
&gt; over.  Would taking the seal off pose any threat to the body, canvas, top?

At the very least it is going to rattle and irritate you as you drive if you
remove it.  Leave it on until you get the new one.

Advice for anyone else missing the seeal with an original canvas: if you
leave the poptop seal off for a long time, you risk rotting the canvas by
the elements as it tends to want to slip outside.  Be sure to check on your
canvas if you've stored your bus outside for any length of time and keep it
tucked in.  Air it out once in a while too.
