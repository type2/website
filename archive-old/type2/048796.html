Subject: [T2] re: heat...etc...

i have seen ads recently for aux oil coolers for bugs that also function as 
heaters as they are mounted inside the body behind the rear seat...some of 
my baja-bug friends had done this years ago so their coolers wouldn't be 
smashed....and they put out alot of heat(guess they are at like 200F or 
so)...anyways i don't know how practical this would be in a bus...long oil 
lines, location, etc..might be worth doing if you lived in point barrow, 
alaska....
