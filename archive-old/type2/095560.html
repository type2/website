Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Dual battery Relay

&gt;Also, as far as I can tell, the way this works is that when the bus is off
&gt;everything is still being run off of the main battery, but if I drain it, I
&gt;have the aux battery to jump start myself... (as long as it's charged) is
&gt;this correct?  Is this continuous drain and recharge of the main battery
&gt;safe (or smart) to do? Or should I rewire the things I want to run when the
&gt;bus is off to another fuse box which would be connected to the aux battery?

and is there any way to set it up (without rewiring all of the accessories
that I want to run while camping ) so that things draw from the aux and not
the main battery?

I took the time to draw out a copy of the wiring diagram that came with the
single-relay kit... perhaps someone could look it over and answer these
questions...
