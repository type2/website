I've checked out the site at [http://web.mit_dot_edu/johnbowe/www/bbn-auto/],
which i've actually been sending people to for a couple of years now - an
amazing resource, but doesn't really have the info i'm looking for on this
one.

can anyone on the list in New England recommend a good auto body place that
can paint my bus, but also deal with some minor rust repair [a little spot
under the windshield seal, and a strip of surface rust under the rear end
of the pop-top]. I need to replace my window seals while i'm at it, because
they're in pretty rough shape. the desert does awful things to rubber! I'm
willing to do some of the body work ahead of time if it'll help bring down
the cost. i can do some light sanding in the driveway, but that's probably
all my landlord will let me get away with.

my parents are in southern vermont, and i'm in boston, so either of those
locations would be preferrable,but i'm willing to arrange to travel
somewhere to have the work done if it's worth it. I'd like to spend less
than $1000 on this, if i can. I really want to make sure that all the
surface rust is wiped out so that this beast will last me a long time. plus
the brown it's painted now makes me want to vomit every time i look at it.

pmail me and i'll post a summary of the responses i get in a few days.

thanks,
-perry
