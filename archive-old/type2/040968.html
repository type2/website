Shawn,

I just re-read your post and have a question...  does your tool bolt to
diagonally opposite studs or to the bottom or top pair?  I *think* that
your tool would be fine as long as you used diagonally opposite studs, but
I would worry if you are using an adjacent pair.  The problem with using
an adjacent pair is that you could pull the cylinder to a canted position
with respect the case, which would invalidate your measurement.  I would
far prefer a plate that used all four studs for each cylinder, to maximize
the chances that the cylinder would be in exactly the position that it
will be in when the head is installed.
