Subject: Easy Pertronix Install? Hah!

I'm so happy! I _finally_ got my new Pertronix Ignitor (TM) for my bus! As
I was pullings apart the box, I was invisioning better gas milage, a nice
power curve and no more adjusting points! And so I got my spare dizzy off
the shelf, and was ready to be awed by the simplistic installation (as
outlined in the install instructions), popped out the old points, and
discovered a problem.

My Ignitor has the module mounted to a round ring that goes around the
dizzy shaft. It's part# 1847A from RMMW. This is fine, excpet by dizzy,
part # 021 905 205 P is a vaccuum advace with the advance arm and circlip,
a black doo hickey (for advance mechanism me thinks) and a grounding strap.
**All** of those prevent the Ignitor ring from sitting flat on the floor.

While diggin thru the archives, it sounded like some people had a banana
style Ignitor, in the shape of the points. What the deal? Or did I
misunderstand something (it DOES happen on occasion).

So the stats again:

1977 with 2.0L w/ Bosch FI
Dizzy # 021 905 205 P (Bosch 050) w/ Vac. Adv.
Pertronix Ignitor 1847A

HELP! Love to get this in b4 the long trip to Jerome

TIA
