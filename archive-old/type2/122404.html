Ebay, thesamba.

I did a search on ebay for &quot;bosch vacuum&quot; and found a few new ones for under
20 bucks. 

The tricky thing is finding the exact one you need, there were a great many
of them made for all the different VW applications. But a working one with a
different advance curve is probably better than none at all. Physically,
almost anything listed as fitting an aircooled beetle will work, unless it
is very early. When I say work, I mean it will fit on/into the distributor.
The rest is up to you. They can be modified for total advance yield by
filing the stop on the arm (will increase total vacuum advance) or bending
the housing towards the stop (will decrease the total advance), but you
can't do anything about when in the rpm range that advance comes on.

Some detective work at oldvolkshome_dot_com and in a bus or beetle Bentley would
be a good idea to find a match for your stock unit.
