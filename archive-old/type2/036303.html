Well, the first thing I do is go out and buy a bottle of J. Lee Roy's Sweet &amp;
Hot Dippin' Sauce.  It comes in a handy little 23 ounce bottle with a nozzle lid
just like the nozzle lid on the quart size gear oil bottles.  Save the sauce in
another container because it's some pretty good stuff.  I then squirt the gear
oil from the big bottle into the dippin' sauce bottle, then squirt the oil into
the tranny.  The smaller bottle fits up under the bus just fine.  I have to
slide in and out from under the bus a few times, but that is where the creeper
comes in handy.  I can usually do this without getting any of that stinky oil on
my hands.
