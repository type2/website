I run a 1970 Campmobile with a healthy, low miles, dead stock 1600 SP.

Last January the pinion gear in my transaxle failed.  The
re-re-re-re-re-builder [I'm not stuttering - that's how many times he's been
inside this &quot;quality custom rebuild&quot; in 3 years!!] replaced the ring and
pinion with a used set.

Unfortunately it's the 7/34, 4.857 ratio out of a late bus tranny [the stock
1970 set is 8/43, 5.375].

The difference in performance is very obvious, even with only the driver
aboard and running light.  Grades on
I-5 in Western Washington that I've driven in this and similar buses for
over 20 years with no problem maintaining 60+ MPH are now major obstacles in
my progress down the road.  In some situations I'm forced to drop into 3rd
and crawl in the curb lane.

The final drive is too tall, dropping engine speed at, say, 60 MPH well
below the engine's torque peak.  If I can get a run at a freeway grade and
hit the hill going 65+ I can often get over the top without dropping below
55 to 57 MPH.  Approaching the grade at 60 means I'll be grunting and
lugging up the grade in 4th or dropping to 3rd to save stress on the engine.

Engine cooling is also a factor.  At freeway speed the cooling fan is
turning much slower than with the stock final drive, and engine temperature
is definitely on the high side.

The effects aren't quite so obvious around town, but there are city hills
that now require 2nd gear that used to be no problem in 3rd.

This setup might not be so bad if I drove all the time in flat country, in
cool weather, but in my situation and region it really stinks.

&gt;&gt; i have acquired a 78 transaxle but havent quite decided if the 1600 dp
can handle the extra tall gearing or not... &lt;&lt;
