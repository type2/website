Subject: Re: Driving with sliding door open, is it legal? 

While I cannot comment on the legality of if I can comment on the safety
aspects.

When I was younger I worked as a SCUBA instructor in St. Croix and drove
around a bus as part of a dive instruction/tour operation.

I would always drive with the slider open as it was the best way to keep
cool in the tropical humidity. I was taking the bus to the store one day and
my girlfriend was sitting next to me as I was commenting on something I'd
seen underwater that morning. I looked over to the passenger seat and she
was gone. I looked over my shoulder and quickly scanned the inside of the
bus - still no sign of her. I quickly deduced that if she was not next to me
and not behind me then she must be outside the bus which was moving about 35
mph down the road. Then, through the rear window I caught a glimpse of her
still tumbling in the road. The rest is a long story but I never did find
out how or why she exited the bus.
