Subject: Re:[T2] broken brake bleeder valve

You didn't state which one you broke...The top or bottom. To my 
understanding, the bottom valve is to replace the fluid. The top valve 
is to bleed. Air will rise, thus when bleeding, all the air will go to the 
top, and releasing the top valve will bleed the air. It would be a little 
more difficult in trying to bleed air from the bottom bleeder, but not 
impossible. 

Hope that helps.
