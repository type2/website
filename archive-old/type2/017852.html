Ok, I was snooping around at a &quot;junkyard&quot; today and found some very
interesting things.  Its in Wisconsin.  There is an old &quot;Thing&quot; that
looks like it was rolled, but the engine is still good, there are also 2
beetles and the engines in those are good, all of the vehicles are
72-74.  Are any of these engines/engine parts compatible with a 71 bus??

Another thing, on my 71 bus there is a little white tank with a hose
running to underneath the bus I believe, the little tank is about
3&quot;x2&quot;x6&quot; or so...what the heck is this thing?? Also there is a cover in
front of the passengers seat under the dash that pulls off, then there
is a cap that can be unscrewed, above it it says in German and English
&quot;Maximum Water 40lbs&quot; or something like that....what is this???  I
already have a water holding tank on the back of my sink/fridge.  And
yet another question, Right by the heating/vent levers there is a little
red button with a &quot;B&quot; on it I believe, when I push this, it lights up,
when I release it, the light goes off...what is this for?

Yes for all of you who are going to tell me to look at the archives
(I've heard it a million times - please quit telling me that), I did
look at the archives, it was all too vague, and accurate responses are
better than general.

Thanks!
