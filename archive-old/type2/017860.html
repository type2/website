Subject: Hitch question?
Message-ID: &lt;372DDF9B.D46FB8DD_at_wans_dot_net&gt;

I did a search of the archives for information regarding hitch
applications on my 75 9 passenger bus.  I've also looked everywhere I
could think for prefab hitches and since mine is an automatic *No luck*
!
Has anyone had any experience getting one installed and working? I do
have a local
repair and weld shop that will try and come up with one but any input
would be appreciated.
I plan on only towing light loads....ie: 71 VW Bug on tow dolly and
maybe a small tent trailer.
Thanks,
Pete
