Subject: WTB Main Heater duct
Message-ID: &lt;381DECF0.F3F72097_at_eoni_dot_com&gt;

All this discussion of HEAT has prompted me to improve the heat in
Bleu.  So, what are you all using for a main heater duct (from the 'Y'
pipe at the rear to the diverter valve in the front)?  I've searched
locally and the best that I've found is either 3 or 4 inch dryer duct.
Plastic...  Not exactly what I had in mind.  Is the stock paper/tin foil
pipe available?  (Ron?)
