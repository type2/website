Does it really matter?  You're going to have to take the engine apart
either way.  Wrist pin bearings in my engine were a gold-ish color (brass
alloy of some sort?) while rod bearings are solder-colored (greyish
silver).

&gt;btw, the engine has never been really hot, and everything was replaced
&gt;when i rebuilt it 10k or so ago.

&gt;now that i know i will have to tear the engine down, my main concern is
&gt;not letting this happen again.  what can i do to find the cause of this
&gt;problem?  i really, really do not want to rebuild the thing _again_ next
&gt;summer.  doing the engine yearly will make owning a VW ludicrous.


The four most likely possibilities, in my book, are:

A)  The rod journals were not within spec.
B)  The bearings were the wrong size.
C)  Everything was the right size but something blocked
    the oil flow to that rod.
D)  Engine overheated (you say it hasn't been really hot - do
    you have oil temp and pressure gauges?).

I would try to find out which of these things happend, then you will know
what not to do next time (hopefully).  The type IV bottom end is really
strong, and something has to be pretty far gone before you will hear a
noise like you describe.

&gt;i guess i will now just go and be sad.

Hey, at least you are doing something about it before the engine grenades
itself and becomes a total loss.  Right now you're looking at new bearings
and oil cooler - less than $200, even less if you elect not to replace the
oil cooler (which you should do if there has been metal circulating inside
your motor, but they are expensive and many people just blow their old ones
out real well - how much do you wanna spend?).  Just lots of labor.  Throw
a rod and it will be more like $1,500.  Look on the bright side, I always
say.  :-)
