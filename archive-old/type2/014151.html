Subject: '73 Bus for sale in York PA (NOT MINE)

Morning Volks,

I gained permission from the daughter of the seller to
post this wonderful bus on the list.  This bus in NOT
MINE, so please don't email me about it...I just
wanted to pass the information along to group of
people that could help find a good home for this bus.

1973 Transporter (White over Orange)
29,000 miles (original)
one owner (that's also a mechanic)
well maintained
garage kept until recently
all original interior/exterior
new tires
new lifetime muffler
4spd manual transmission
$7500 (serious inquires only)

300 Haines Road
York, PA

I noticed a repairable tear in the drivers
seat...that's all I can say that's &quot;bad&quot; about this
vehicle.

Volks, this bus is beautiful.  If I only wasn't off on
my X-country trip in my just completed Westy...I would
buy it, but I can't.  The family wants to find a good
home for this beloved bus.  They don't want someone
that's going to toss lumber in it without a care in
the world.

Please help save this all original and beautiful bus,
because I can't.

Email Allison for more info:

Thanks!
Missy:)

1975 Westy &quot;meine Rettung&quot;
w/1978 engine w/single carb. mod.
