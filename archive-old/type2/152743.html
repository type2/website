Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator cooling boot

The 021 903 655 D was discontinued AND superseded by VW quite awhile (4 or 5
years ago?) back to the &quot;B&quot;, which (wouldn't surprise me) was probably in
error and could have been different sized.  Dunno, never have seen a &quot;D&quot;
until Troy's photos appeared now.

Upon a bit of sleuthing through my &quot;ancient&quot; VAG Parts Fiche, here's
probably why the size may have changed, but VW does NOT indicate to use a
different Elbow Boot:

Some models used 021 119 199 D (75-79 Original, 72 Replacement) or E (72
Original) Fan Shroud Unit.

73-74 Models used 021 119 199L or P Fan Shroud Unit.

In addition, all Type 2 Print Books and most Fiche all indicate to use the
021 903 655 B Elbow Boot with the 55 amp Alternator.  The latest Fiche
(1983) indicates the 021 903 655 D Elbow Boot, but is to be used only on
72-79 Models with the REPLACEMENT 55 Amp Alternator and says NOTHING about
thre Fan Shroud (see 411/412 comments below).

Going further, I consulted both My 411/412 Book &amp; Fiche for further
clarification:

Book:
021 119 199 E  Fan Shroud 411/412 70-74 and it uses the &quot;B&quot; Boot

Fiche:
021 119 199 D  Fan Shroud 411/412 70-74 and the text further indicates it is
a REPLACEMENT and to use 021 119 655 D Boot when replacing.

It would have been nice if they had put the same informative content in the
Type 2 Fiche!

Looking at Troy's Pics, it can't be denied they are two different sizes.

When we decided to repro the boot, we went with what samples (the B) we
could obtain.  With the knowledge of the D boot being superseded we figured
the boots were similarly the same.  Why VW went to a different size and to a
smaller one is mystifying, as I would think you'd wanna have a larger
exhaust hole for the hotter air.

The &quot;B&quot; Boot is apparently the larger of the two.  No one I know makes the
&quot;D&quot; Boot. :-(

&gt; &gt; The boot you have is for 72-73 bus. You need the &quot;D&quot; one.
&gt;
&gt; That explains much....
&gt;
&gt; Does anybody make the &quot;D&quot; one?
