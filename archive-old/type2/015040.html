&gt;I am in the market for a Westfalia camper. I was wondering what the
difference is in horsepower, between a 1982 Vanagon aircooled, and a 1989
Vanagon watercooled. Which one has a better reliability record?? Is the
1982 Vanagon engine exactly the same as the 1979 bus engine?? If it is,
then isn't the 1979 bus lighter in weight than the 1982 Vanagon?? I need it
to be able to go up hills without a problem. Thanks in advance.....

The aircooled has no power.  None.  Nada.  (Mostly because it's heavy.
Power to weight ratio is about 1:50)  On the other hand, the aircooled is
as reliable as any aircooled VW ever made, which is pretty good.  The
Wasserboxer is as unreliable as any vehicle anyone ever made, which is
pretty bad.  Get an aircooled.  Hills?  There's a door pocket that holds
magazines, so you have something to read while going up hills.
