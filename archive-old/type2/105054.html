Subject: Re: [T2] Inexpensive headlight

From: &quot;Karl&quot; &lt;aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;
&gt; The brand does not matter. Any large round h/lamp will work. The Halogen
is better than non-Halogen.

Didn't know that I could get halogen, cool.  (I haven't had to buy a
headlight for any of my cars for years).

&gt; Have you swapped yours from side-to-side to verify that the GE is bad?

Actually, no.  I was going to pull the headlight and use a multimeter before
I made the trip to get a new headlamp.

And Ted, thanks for the heads up on WalMart.
