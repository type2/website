(blah, blah, blah, blah removed)

Well I hate to disagree and all and waste list time as this isn't Friday but
what the hell, we've already suffered it in the original message.

&gt;I Did a lubrication inspection on a 98 Eurovan chassis Winnabago built
&gt;Rialta yesterday, VR-6 engine, 5000k miles. Oil was BLACK under factory
&gt;maintenance interval. Filter is a cartridge type and was out of stock at my

Is this the type2 list, did I get off on the Eurovan express somewhere?
Quick where is Ric Golen 8-) (oops oh the spirit of that list is long dead)
Wow BTW 5000000 miles on one oil change? sure should have been dark.

&gt;Or is the idea to not change the filter during one or more repeating lube
&gt;intervals????

The idea is to service the car in the manner specified by the people who
understand it best, the people who designed and made it.

&gt;Neanderthal Engineers (NEs) who are too busy interfacing with the Bean
&gt;Counters (BCs) to be bothered with insuring the UTs know the big picture.

Anyone who knows any engineer knows even the dumb ones never, ever,
interface with the bean counters.

&gt;Cause it isn't a good spin on type make than 3 NDM

It is a much superior filter as EVIDENCED by a number of articles about
the improvement including actual DATA when the VR6 first came out in
'92.  Studies of the filtration based on oil analysis of preproduction
engines.
VW may not be on the cutting edge of ergonomics or serviceability and
never has been but they know how to make a reliable product.  As to getting
it's cover off, well you take the thing for proper VW service you get proper
VW tools used, so has always been the case, you do less, you get less
and accept the risks.

&gt;Having to R&amp;R four bolts for regular service is 4 NDM added = 7 NDM.

Annoying to be sure, a smart servicing technician who figures he might be
going to service the car for a while, or a smart owner simply modifies the
pan themselves, course you need to be pleasant enough for the owner to
allow you to do so and for them to keep coming back.

&gt;Plastic filter structure makes 8 NDM.

Any engineered plastic part today designed for regular replacement is as
good as metal, likely better.  It is only where overoptimistic engineers think
plastic will last forever that we run into problems (ie wasserboxer coolant
manifolds.)  Indeed you can do some neat things with plastics you can't
do with metal.  Now don't get me wrong, many people have heard my famous
quote &quot;anything you ever had and loved made of plastic did one thing, it
cracked.&quot;, but for frequently replaced or well tested and proven plastic parts
one must simply come into the 20th century (or beyond.)

&gt;As well, changing plugs on this sucker would appear to be worse than a 72
&gt;Type II with Type IV motor, the ones without the upper access hatch. At
&gt;least 4 of them will be worse so that's 4 NDM added = 12 NDM.

The penalty of stuffing a 6cyl engine into a 5cyl hole, not that the 5 was any
easier to service.  It should be noted this is the only portion of this
message
even vaguely relating to the point of this mailist, the Type II vehicle.
Oh and
hell although an annoyance to make this message of some potential use to
a Type2 owner, the '72 plugs can be easily accessed as can any T4 front
plugs by grabbing yourself a short wobble extension bar, the Harbor Freight
set exceptional value for crappy Chinese tools that can really save you grief.
I seldom if ever use the upper hatch actually even for those plugs, too hard
to lean over to get to.

&gt;Oil was BLACK during specified service interval. 13 NDM

Complete utter bull.  Oil should be black after a correct factory service
interval.
Hell I'm surprised VW has stepped it down to 5000 if that is indeed correct.
Watercooled VW's aren't aircooled VW's, anyone who has put well in excess
of over 250k each on a score of watercooled VW's following the specified
6500 mile services using a quality oil and at least a fair quality filter
knows that
black does not equal anything.  Indeed most good oil with proper detergent
package is &quot;black&quot; very quickly.  Blanket statements like this without DATA
are foolish at best, if one was really worried did they blow the $10 to
send the
oil for analysis, is there a REAL problem or just some fuzzy perception of
a problem?  Testing and data make fact, air cooled mentality in a water cooled
world does little more than keep chain Grease Monkeys in a somewhat
lucrative business.

&gt;But the DM lives on in the 4 decades of German production prior to the
&gt;90's. You know, the ones WE got, and with continued DM they will outlive
&gt;the compromises in current manufacture.

Only time will tell, I'm sure people said the same things when them ugly
Type 4 engined vans first came out, the test of time makes reliability not
nostalgia.  Nostalgia forgets transporter engines that only lasted 65k miles
in harder driven splits and the like.  There are quite a few '93 EV's out
there
now with well over 150k on them, how many splits racked up 150k cruising
at 75+ mph in 6 or 7 years?  Now I'm not saying anything for the new stuff,
I sort of abhor it myself but is the engineering that much worse, I doubt it.

&gt;I can see a day several years from now when a VR-6 Eurovan comes in for
&gt;it's 100,000 mile spark plug replacement and two of six plugs bring the
&gt;threads out with them. Let's see, R&amp;R plugs every 100,000 miles, includes
&gt;R&amp;R heads, $2500 to do it right, maybe half that to jurusrigus. Then the

A final note, the spec on the excessively expensive surface gap plugs on my
'91 G60 Corrado was of course also 90k.  Took them out and looked at them
at 30k, and replaced them at 60k for the hell of it but there was no
improvement
for doing so.  Modern technology is often a monster but in general, as it
always
has been, taking the word of 100's of engineers and designers who have been
working every day for a company for 20 years often is better than &quot;common
street sense.&quot;  Data makes fact, NDM's just make nonsense.

'78 rabbit had 350k on 6500 mile oil changes when it died hit by a 2 ton
truck,
oil was always black within 500 miles, course it was a diesel.
