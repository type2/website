Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator light on.

mine did this awhile and my belt was real loose...? light was bright then...not fully lit but brighter...than it is now with a tight belt...hmmmm&gt;?
 
have you checked your belt...?
 
mine still does this from time to time though faintly very dim at night along with the bright lights on and when the turn signals are on but not like it used to....???
 
i would like to hear a solution or cause for this as well..?

For the last few days, the alternator light has come on when my RPMs 
are low. Last night I also noticed that it alternates with the turn 
signal light when I have the headlights on.

Is this a sign of an impending alternator failure?
