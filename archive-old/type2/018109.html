Subject: Child's Hammock / Cot
Message-ID: &lt;3745EB3A.908A5F94_at_virtual1.rbw_dot_usu_dot_edu&gt;

I found someone selling a child's cot on the web for $50.  Before I
contacted him, I thought I would ask the list and find out if anyone had
an extra one that they could sell me or if this guy even has the right
one for my bus.

I have a '70 Westy, and the seller says he has a cot for &quot;'68 and
later.&quot;  Is this right?  Are the cots this interchangable?

Anyway, TIA for any help or leads you can offer.
