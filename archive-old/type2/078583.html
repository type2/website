at the time I paid a friend to do the welding, now I have a MIG and do my
own welding, 

&gt; can't see just grinding them all down because the sheet metal would get
&gt; flattened. So is this a smart use for Body Filler?  How about for the pits

no body filler anywhere.   some shallow flattening  now going back and
getting the bad spots as I find em, or they find me.  rust is a never
ending job on an old bus.  That's why I say make sure you get a paint you
can match easy.


&gt; left after a patch seam?   How do those folks that do &quot;all steel&quot; work deal
&gt; with this?  My guess is replace the panel, is it right?

in my dreams, I have three panels that need replacing that's my next
attempt.   twice a year I take a short vacation and do some of the major
work, usually spring and fall when the weather is nice.

&gt; 
&gt; so I picked a panel, sanded and ground and patched and etc.
&gt;    when it was smooth I masked, primed and within the hour I painted  all
&gt; high quality canned paint.    not perfect but it looks pretty decent.
