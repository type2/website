&gt; Mike I don't believe this is correct. The distributor drive key is

&gt; it's far from optimal. The only real way to fix it is to do exactly what 
&gt; the mechanic &quot;said&quot; he did and orientate the gear to the correct place.

Hey Jason,
I'm not really sure what you mean by the parts binding?  The distributor 
drive dog only fits one way into the drive gear so I don't see what 
parts would be binding.  Also, if the drive gear is in-fact out of 
alignment by 180*, it can be fixed by removing the spring keeper, 
pressing out the pin, flipping the drive dog 180*, and reassembling.  It 
will not cause any binding.  Not the optimal setup, but the distributor 
functionality will be exactly the same.

Now, if the drive gear is off by something other than 180*, then your 
timing will be off regardless.

Mike
