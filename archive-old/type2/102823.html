Subject: Torque Specs??

Would someone please give me torques specs on the following: Flywheel to
Crank, Pressure plate to Flywheel and Rocker Arms to head.  All of this is for
a T4 1700.

Also what's a good manual to buy for the T4 motor to get Torques specs?  I've
got a Bentley for the 67 down Bus.  But don't have anything that covers T4
motors.

Dave
