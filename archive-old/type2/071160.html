Subject: valve stem caps
Message-ID: &lt;c381dfcf.249cf917_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Greetings,
has anyone ever had any use for valve stem caps??  when used do they allow 
the valve to still rotate like it is supposed to when the adjusting screw 
hits the stem at an off-set??  or does the cap itself just end up spinning on 
the valve stem??  

thanks,
zac
