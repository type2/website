Chris and Volks,

I reckon I expected this, but it is an annoyance when the realizaton finally 
settles. This rebuild isn't going to be as trouble-free as it was beginning 
to appear :-)

I was really pleased when I looked into China Cat's lower end. The rod 
bearing side clearance checked out good, as did the grab and push test, and 
the cam looked really nice, even though the lifters were obviously not from a 
set. The cylinder/piston/pin/ring assemblies are all in good shape, well 
within tolerances and highly usable.

However, when I took the heads apart, all my elation drained out. I have two 
different heads and neither is original.The engine is a 1.8 L FI engine.

The left head was from a 74 dual carb, going by the valve measurements. It is 
a good head and needs only minor cleanup. The right head, however, is from a 
(probably) 76/77 2.0 L FI engine.

Boy, I'll bet that dude vibrated!!! having different valve sizes and 
combustion chamber volumes on opposite sides. Also, I think I know why there 
was combustion leakage... just 1 mm larger spigot in the head than the 
diameter of the jug :-)

So now, I'm out looking for another 74 dual carb head.

Still, I consider myself lucky that more isn't wrong with it. I will have to 
have the flywheel and the pressure plate surfaced and deglaze the clutch 
plate. Bad looking stuff in there ;-)

Turns out that I work with a fellow who runs a part-time a bug shop in 
Andersonville, and he will help me find some of this stuff.

The type2 list is an invaluable resource. I'm amazed how much of the 
day-to-day traffic is relevant to our project. After taking down the upper 
end yesterday, my son grabbed Muir and started reading. I expect that he's 
tired of asking what all these bits do and intends to find out for himself.

Thanks for your interest and help.

Cheers/Carron
75 Westy &quot;China Cat&quot;
