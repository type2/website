Personally I liked the one (I believe it was yours but it may have been Jorge's) that said:

                Will Be President For Food.

And how about:
                Auntie Em. Hate you, hate Kansas, taking the dog.  Dorothy.
Or
                Welcome to Texas, now go home.
OR
                Cover me.  I'm changing lanes.
Or
                I don't care who you are, what you are driving, or where you would rather be.
