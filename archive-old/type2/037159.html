&gt; Thanks to those of you who answered my questions concerning the '79 bus I went to S.C. to see this past week. A few of you  commented that something sounded fishy and it was. First, it was as cheap a new paint job as you could get, with some surface rust painted over to the point that you could scrape off new paint with your fingernail! All gaskets around doors and windows had paint on them(one of the things one of you told me to look for). This guy had tried to &quot;pretty up&quot; a bus that had lots of problems I won't bore you with, but I am curious 'bout one thing. When driving this automatic, when it would shift from 1st to 2nd, there was a loud &quot;thump&quot; that was so severe you could actually feel it. This only happened if you accelerated at a fairly good pace. Any ideas what this indicates?

automatics should shift smoothly, even to the point of not even feeling
the shift on a 76-79 automatic in good condition.

did you smell the tranny fluid. it should be purplish/red and should not
smell (burned)

my first guess would be a burned/bad brake band or planetary lock... (hand
to describe the parts without my manual handy) but read &quot;expensive&quot;
expect to put several hundred into that tranny.  

unlike the earlier VW tranny the later one has two different planetary 
brake systems, one a band brake the other a disk brake.  one or the other
seems to be malfunctioning...  could be very dirty filter, or sticky
weight in govenor, but I would put my money on a bad planetary brake.

if your really interested, pull the bottom pan and check for metal flakes
and in the filter.  (the Bentley manual explains how to pull the pan and
check the filter)

there is usually a little bit of &quot;sludge&quot; in the bottom of the pan but
much more than a thimble full means the tranny fluid hasn't been changed
lately, much more than a flake or two of metal look real close.
