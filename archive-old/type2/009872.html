&gt;
&gt;....that is the question. I set my 74 1800, dual carbs, stock, to 10* ATDC 
&gt;static as suggested in Muir &amp; Bentley. Now it runs terribly! It had been 
&gt;previously set to 4* BTDC and ran well, with the exception of the low idle 
&gt;miasma I'm puzzling through.
&gt;
&gt;As I shot it with a timing light &amp; accelerated, the notch seems to advance 
&gt;and retard well enough--up to 10* BTDC or so (I didn't check this in 
&gt;detail.) While driving, the engine coughs, sputters, bucks and pops, 
&gt;particularly after shifting into 3rd. Didn't do that with the 4* BTDC 
&gt;setting--just a mild backfire on decel and slight run-on after the ignition 
&gt;was switched off.
&gt;
&gt;Why do you suppose it runs better at BTDC than at ATDC? Any suggestions 
&gt;appreciated as I try to fix a series of leaks, boo-boos and mysteries the 
&gt;PO left behind.

WHOA   Stop!! You can't set a dual vacuum unit distributor staticly at the 
timing specs that's called for at idle.

You do not have vacuum on the retard side with the engine off. If you are 
going to set it staticly, set it at 7.5 BTDC. When you start it you should 
have vacuum on the retard side and then it will go to 10 ATDC. If it doesn't 
you have 2 things wrong: either you have no vacuum to the retard [inboard 
nipple] side at idle or the vacuum unit is bad.
