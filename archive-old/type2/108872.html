Subject: It's time to do my first engine pull in 20+ years!

From: &quot;Marcus Schaper&quot; &lt;mschaper_at_gvpt.umd_dot_edu&gt;
&gt; No smell, no apparent smoke up front. This was the result:

Now I know that I've got the fever again after all of these years, I almost
cried to see what happened to your bus.
-------

G got us home tonight, but it wasn't a fun trip.  The oil leak has affected
the clutch so badly that it's no longer a good idea to drive him.

I backed him into the drive today and will be picking up the boards and
other bits to pull the engine.  We'll spend a few weeks going over the
engine, though I'm not up to going into a full or partial rebuild at this
time.  (Not enough $ to go the whole 9 yards).

I've got an unmounted workbench engine mount, but will be working on the
engine out in the drive.  I'm looking at some way to mount the mount on a
post or some other widget to make working on the engine a stand up
comfortable thing.  No sense working harder than necessary.  A 4&quot; x 4&quot; post?
6&quot; x 6&quot;?

The trick will be working out how to get the engine w/mount onto the female
bit that mounts on the bench/post.  Just how many folk does it take to lift
a 2L? {grin}

Um... and exactly how does the engine mount attach to the engine?  Pics,
anyone?

While the engine's out, we'll take a look at the fuel tank, clean out the
engine compartment, look at the fire suppression idea while there's room to
work in there, start the modifications for the wheel well blower mount, aux
battery installation, etc..

Cool. :O)
