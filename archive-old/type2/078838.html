For Sale: Manual Transmission from 1979 VW Bus

Four speed. Good condition. I replaced it for no particular reason about =
five years ago. It's been sitting on top of a pallet, covered by a tarp =
ever since.

This tranny came from my one-owner '79 bus when it had 133k miles on it. =
It doesn't howl (except for the normal whine in reverse), or leak, or =
slip in gear.

I'm asking $275 for the tranny, plus shipping.
