Thanks, Bob.

White shoe dye?!?!?

I did get one hint from down under (Australia) that suggested 'liming 
white'.

Up here, this translates to 'white wash' or,

http://www.dictionary_dot_com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=liming says ==&gt;&gt;

  tr.v. limed, lim·ing, limes

    1.To treat with lime.
    2.To smear with birdlime.
    3.To catch or snare with or as if with birdlime.


BIRD SHIT!!

So, I will try the shoe dye first.

&gt;try shoe dye, need to find a &quot;Shoe finder&quot; who sells stuff wholesale to
&gt;shoemakers.  they are getting a little harder  to find,  BTW it is funny
&gt;stuff to work with so try it out on some scrap first

&gt; &gt; I have a '72 camper with the white 'birch' paneling.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I would like to re:finish the paneling.  Any suggestions?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I can use Acetone to strip the heavy covering, but I just cannot, for 
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; life of me, get an oil based 'white' {pickled oak} stain to take; on a 
&gt;test
&gt; &gt; piece, it just soaks in and does not change color.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At the suggestion of a Home Depot sales rep, I tried some water based 
&gt;white
&gt; &gt; stain, and it seems to just lay on top of the wood, pretty much like the
&gt; &gt; original stuff.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I guess I am searching for a stain that will soak in and change the 
&gt;color to
&gt; &gt; a white'ish color.
