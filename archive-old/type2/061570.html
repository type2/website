Subject: High Beam Dash light

Hello, All!

This is my first post, so I am sorry if I do something wrong.  (Let me
know and I promise never to do it again!!!)

The high beam light on my dash board does not work.  Is there a fuse I
need to check or is there a bulb to replace for the dash light to show
that my high beams are on?

I have a 1976 Westy.  If you know how to fix the problem, let me know
in detail, because I am a newbie at repairs!

Thanks, and Peace to you all during the holidays and in the coming year!

Peace, Love, Happiness, and Music to you all.....

                   Lauren
