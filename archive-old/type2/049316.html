&gt;&gt;  Dear all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I would like to put a compresor in the back of my 1979 2L to use as
&gt;&gt;  an air compressor.
&gt;&gt;  I have heared that a &quot;york&quot; would be good. Has anyone got an AC system on a
&gt;&gt;  2L?
&gt;&gt;  WHere does the extra pulley go? Alternator or fan?
&gt;&gt;  Any input welcome including parts and pictures.
&gt;&gt;  Thanks,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Lukas
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  PS: Want to be able to pump the tires on the move after driving in
&gt;&gt;  sand, in case you are wondering...
&gt;
&gt;Pump the tires on the move? Oh boy.
&gt;
&gt;If you have an army base near you, go to the town close to it and look for
&gt;an army truck. There are two kinds I know of that have on-the-move inflation
&gt;systems, the new-generation 5-ton and the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles
&gt;2.5-ton. You would not believe how complex the air plumbing out to the tires
&gt;is--I don't think you could do it on a Bus without replacing a *lot* of
&gt;parts on the wheel hubs.
&gt;
&gt;I'd just get one of those little tire-inflator compressors they sell at the
&gt;FLAPS and use that.
&gt;




Not while driving....
Just to re-inflate when back on the road with a long hose from the engine bay..
... a lot of jeeps have that set up..
The electrical ones tned to take forever...
