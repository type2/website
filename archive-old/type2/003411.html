Karl,

I replaced the canvas the same way the old canvas came out, which was the original canvas.  Yes, the staples are showing, but that was the way it originally was on my bus.  How I did it was to drape the canvas over the yardstick at the proper tightness and staple the canvas in place without the plastic strip there, and then go back with the plastic strip and put a staple in every inch.  This was how the old canvas came out and as I said above, I am fairly certain that the old canvas was the original with the bus.

I will have to look at my brothers 79 to see how his is attached, but how are the staples hidden as you refer to in your email?

&gt; 
&gt; I am confused. How did you staple thru the plastic strip, thru the canvas,
&gt; into the wood with the canvas folded and hanging down?
&gt; Or did you cheat and staple thru the canvas, thru the plastic, thru the
&gt; canvas, into the wood? In other words, the staples are showing?
&gt; They are supposed to be hidden.
