Subject: One wire on Alternator question.

Ok, below is a quote of the typical stuff I've found in the archive. I've got my alternator/regulator harness re-wired, but I can't figure out where the black wire goes on the Alternator.

Sounds like it's always on, so does it just tie into the BIG RED wire at B+? And on a 76' Kombi does it just goto the test terminal? In witch, it doesn't really need to be hooked up does it? 

TIA
Chris


&gt; The 4th wire in this bundle is black and is &quot;hot&quot; even with the key off.  It
&gt; has a protected push on connector on the end of it.
&gt; 
&gt; Where should this wire go?
&gt; What should it be connected to?

In the older wiring diagrams it went to the diagnostic computer socket in
the engine compartment.
