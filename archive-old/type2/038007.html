&gt;It's a blue pickup truck, front-wheel drive, cab-over-engine type of thing.
&gt;It's got a bus transaxle (engine behind TA - it's not backwards or anything)
&gt;connected to a set of driveaxles and spindles don't _look_ custom (maybe
&gt;Syncro bus?). 

Do a web search for Tatra. They made something that looks very much like
what you describe.
