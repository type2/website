so run a  10 gauge wire from the positive post to the momentary switch, then
another  10 gauge wire to the solenoid , with the sapde connector on it, hide
the  wires, mount the switch and that is it?



hey Guys  You can do it that way if you desire a button but all I do  is run 
one wire to the solenoid and then just touch it to the hot side of the  
battery,  when not in use just tie it out of the way. later  mark  dearing
