Subject: Re: [T2] die grinder

&gt; I have done a lot of welding on my 73 Westfalia and now have a lot of

&gt; beads that I would use it on.  Has anyone out there heard of an electric die 
&gt; ginder?  Something like an air die grinder only electric.  Any help is 
&gt; always appreciated.  Thanks, James.

some years ago I picked up an electric tool called a &quot;power file&quot; really
makes quick work of those tight spaces jobs,  problem is it is a
discontinued Black and Decker tool, even when avaliable it was over $100
and the belts are about a $1 each but I wouldn't trade mine for the world,
especially since I have no air compressor or air tools.   it's gotta run
on a long extension cord or on my generator
