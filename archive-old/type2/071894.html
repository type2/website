Greetings listers,

	My friend presented me with a gas heater of unknown origins.  He got it from 
his boss who was cleaning out old stuff.  The heater is about 20 inches long 
total.  It has a 12v 3.5 inch squirrel cage fan on one end.   It is attached to 
the body with 4 screws in adjustable slots.  There is a bimetal thermostat 
inside the fan duct that operates a cam against a micro switch mounted on the 
outside.  The other end has a couple of fuel line, and what looks like a 
solenoid. There is a high tension type ceramic ignitor on the end. There is also
a big ceramic block on the side.  There is no name on the thing, only patent 
numbers and one French patent number. All in all the thing looks used not 
abused. The questions are:

1. What is it?

2. Can I repair it?  Manuals?  Parts?

3.  Is it worth it?

Thanks in advance.
