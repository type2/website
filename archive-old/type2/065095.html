Subject: met a listmember!

I met Matt Henricks tonight.  I knew he was coming to Sac, but I didn't
expect him so soon.

I was coming home from a grueling mtn bike ride (the first real technical
ride on my brand new full-suspension diamondback!) and as I'm pulling in the
driveway, I see this ch*vy van trolling for addresses.  He guns it and pulls
up, leans out and asks &quot;Are you Thom Fitzpatrick?&quot; well, yes, yes I am.
yada yada yada.

So I give him a tour of the '56 and the barndoor, showing him all the cool
barndoor bits, talk busses for an hour or so, and he bails.  sold him a 40hp
motor

kinduva cool guy.
