Subject: Re: [T2] Anti-Seize

&gt;Now that REALLY makes a lot of sense to me.  All I have is a 'click'
&gt;wrench.  Can you recommend a good dial wrench?

You can check it with your 'click' wrench. Just set it to 1ft/lb (I'm
assuming it goes that low) and start to turn it. If it clicks, then turn it
to 2, if it clicks go to 3 etc etc. once you find the number where you can
spin it in without the torque wrench clicking, you've found your run-in
torqure, then just add the number it to the required torque spec.
 As jay raby wrote - 18ft/lb spec plus 4ft/lb run in = 22ft/lb

fasteners adds to the spec
&gt;and requires a higher value to make the spec EXACTLY ?

Yes.

&gt;&gt;The &quot;Proper&quot; method of torquing is measuring the &quot;run on torque&quot; and then
&gt;&gt;adding those numbers to the final torque specs For example
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;A bolt has  an 18 Lb/ft spec, it takes 4 lb/ft of &quot;run on torque&quot; to run
the
&gt;&gt;bolt onto the threads. The aactual torque should be set to 22 lb/ft.
