Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot Front Door Seals

That doesn't look right. I did my driver's side last Fall (p-side on
shelf awaiting inspiration) and it had a firm corner for the spot you
photographed. I'm presuming that you're putting the driver's side seal
on the driver's side door. Perhaps the seals have changed since last
year. Barring that, you may need to verify that the seal in hand is the
correct year/side for your application.

&gt; I purchased outer door seals for a 71 Bus from Bus Depot. I trial

&gt; on the
&gt; rubber fits over the edge of the metal until it gets near the upper
&gt; rear
&gt; corner, then has to jump over the edge.

&gt; Here are two pictures of the upper rear corner of the drivers side
&gt; door, one
&gt; from the inside and one from outside:
