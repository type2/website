&gt; 
&gt; Big problem #1:  Shifting into first is becoming quite a chore.  No matter
&gt; how slowly i let up the clutch it shutters like mad.  It also does it in
&gt; reverse but not as bad.  Smooth as butter going into 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.  I
&gt; checked the motor mounts today, tightened them up a bit (they weren't
&gt; loose), but still shuttering.  They don't look busted, but i don't know
&gt; exactly what busted motor mounts look like (yes, i am new at this).  Is it
&gt; time to drop that old engine and put in a new clutch? or should i look
&gt; elsewhere?
&gt; 
&gt; Little problem #1: While rambling around the local bone yard i found a
&gt; tach/gas/H20 gauge in an old scirocco (sp?) that fits perfectly in the hole
&gt; that formerly held my non-functioning clock/gas gauge (to which i might add,
&gt; is up for grabs if anybody is interested, free).  Anyhow, now to wire the
&gt; bugger...I've got it in and working, however i didn't hook up a ground, just
&gt; the 12v power and the wire to the coil, and (here's the situation) it seems
&gt; more difficult to fire up.  Turns over fine, just takes a few seconds longer
&gt; to start.  If i detach the wire from the coil to the tach it fires up just
&gt; fine.  Could this be related to not having grounded out the tach? if not,
&gt; should i ground the tach regardless?
&gt; 
&gt; your wisdom is much appreciated

Justin:
Yes, you'll probably need a new disc, maybe a new pressure plate, of
course a new throwout bearing, but one thing more: The release forks
tend to wear flat on the area where the bearing rides and that tends to
make the clutch shudder during release. Seems like I read that in the
Vanagon list and it's often hard to detect. A new fork would fix it,
maybe some grinding work might do it too.
