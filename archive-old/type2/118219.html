Subject: Natural Bus route info

The plan is to go to NaturalBus on Sat AM. Stella and I will be 
traveling alone (that sounds odd) and I was considering taking a 
different route and wanted some feedback from someone who knows the 
area.

The usual route is US 220 to I-581 to US 11 to I-81 to Natural 
Bridge. The grade on I-81 and the trucks make that a hellride to 
Suckville.

Alternate from Greensboro, NC could be US 29 to Lynchburg, VA and 
pick up US- 501 to Glasgow and then take the &quot;black line &quot; on the map 
that cuts over to Natural Bridge. This is uncharted territory for me. 
Has anyone taken this route or familiar with these roads. I am trying 
to determine of I will encounter worse hills the the usual route. I 
have to cross the Blue Ridge somewhere and Roanoke is fairly benign 
but I hate the interstate in the bus...........

Thanks
Chris
