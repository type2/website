Subject: Re: [T2] Gas in my oil

Gas in oil is a symptom of running rich. It will contribute to
accelerated wear of rings and pistons, and other engine components to
the extent that gasoline dilutes the motor oil.

Fine droplets out of the breather tube is more likely oil mist.
Capture some by holding clean paper up against it and smell the
resulting stain. A small amount is normal. If you pull the hose off
the black cap and put your finger up towards the cap outlet while the
engine is running and feel a lot of air blowing on your finger, you
have excessive blowby in your crankcase, again caused by worn rings.

In cold weather air moisture will condense on the insides of the
exhaust. When you start your engine, the exhaust will expel water from
the exhaust, and heat will evaporate water causing the steamy fog that
comes out the tailpipe.

 Can anyone help an ignoramus figure out why I keep getting gas in my oil?
 Also it comes out in fine droplets from the breather cap (I think that9s
 what it is).  The black cap with thick rubber hose that originates near the
 fan shroud and puts exhaust back in front of the throttle (between the air
 meter and throttle).  My plugs don9t get oily.  Also is this something to
 worry about?  Thank you listees.  BTW its a 79 FI 2.0 AC Wedge.  Can9t
 figure out where or why gas and oil would come in contact.
 
 One more question, water coming from the exhaust?  I know lots of cars do
 this but now that it9s getting cold, mine does it and never used to.
