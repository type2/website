Subject: Re: Subject: leaky master cylinder grommets

Eddie,

Have someone pump the brakes while you're underneath the bus, looking at the
master cylinder. You might be able to see where it's leaking from. It might be
leaking from where the brake light switches screw into the master cylinder. If
so, unscrew the brake light switches, wrap Teflon tape around the switches'
threads, and screw them back in.

Good luck.

Hello List,

I replaced my master cylinder about 10 months ago with a brazillian
unit. It appeared to be better quality than some others I've seen
floating around. The bus is a '74. At the same
time i also replaced my faulty servo, stop light switches and crusty old
brake lines.

About 2 months ago I noticed it was low on brake fluid. I got under
there and saw it all over the new master cylinder. I thought it was
leaking at the resevior to reservoir line. I suspected those
rubber sleeves to be bad so I ordered some new ones.

Today I got under there and noticed that it wasn't the line at all but
the rubber grommets that connect the master cylinder to the resevoir had
fluid all over them. All those parts were new.
