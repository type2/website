Subject: Re: Mojave phone booth -- how to drive on loose sand?
Message-ID: &lt;0.61f72a72.25547d9c_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

The best way to drive on loose sand is:
    1)  Avoid it
    2)  If you can spot it ahead of time and have no alternate path, Use 2nd 
gear 
        and get speed up before you hit the sand. 
        No sharp turns, uphill is hopeless
    3)  Carry a shovel, carpet remnants about one foot by three to four feet 
long, 
        extra water (to drink).
If you drive in sand, eventually you will get stuck. Be prepared. Tow 
services usually won't go off pavement. If they do, they charge huge extra 
fees.
If you start to bog down, get your foot off the accelerator. If you don't, 
you just dig a deeper hole.

This information is a result of 30 years of off-road vehicle operation. Four 
wheel drive just means you get stuck worse and in more inaccessible places. 
It is fun though, and like keeping our buses running, builds confidence.
