Subject: the beast at what cost??? (chatty)

&lt;This is an example of where I part with the &quot;I paid $200 for my bus
and &lt;I 
&lt;use it as a daily drive&quot; crowd. A complete reconstruction of the
&lt;braking 
&lt;system can be done for as little as $300. Why would anyone not do
this?

ok i have listened to this on going mentality too long.  there are a
LOT of bus owners on here who have purchased buses and have kept them
running daily for a mere pittance of money.  

as to the above comment on *why would someone not do this*  well lets
see...i do need to have great brakes so i don't kill anyone.  that
much is agreed on.  but you can buy all new cylinder rebuild kits for
about $2-3 (local flaps) and rebuild all wheel cyl. and master.  brake
shoes are a dime a dozen.  a NAPA set will last many thousands of
miles.  if the brake hoses are NOT cracked, then simply keep the brake
fluid changed regularly to slow down the aging process.  shop around
for having the drums turned. (locally about $4-5 each)  dis-assemble,
re-paint the backing plate, clean, clean,clean...and get the other
needed parts at a salvage yard.  

i cant remember how many times i have seen wrecked buses/bugs with
nearly brand new brakes on them.  very cheap.

ok i know the comment above was not to beget a discussion on how cheap
someone can do a reliable brake job.  but actually that IS the
point.   dumping $300 into a COMPLETE no HOLDS BARRED brake system
renewal is not always practical or even NEEDED!  many of us began or
bus journeys in life many many years ago.  going through college
keeping our transportation a true daily driver.  to class, starting
our own business, driving to mexico for spring break, back east 1500
miles to see relatives, to colorado for skiing, back to florida with
the girlfriend....and all of this done with a very limited budget. 
(don't start with...well how do you do all those other activities,
unless you have a lot of extra cash...skiing aint cheap)....well i
don't know of any college student who doesn't room with/share gas/
etc. with at least a 1/2 dozen fellow blokes.

so just remember that just because a bunch of us have progressed in
life now to having the cash on hand to buy a new engine out-right,
instead of tearing it down to find out all it needed was to replace
ONE broken piston ring!!...that it applies.  i still appreciate the
stories of fellow bus owners hand making or repairing a part.  there
are many ways to keep the bus running without throwing a lot of money
at it...and yes mine all are true DAILY DRIVERS.  even my wife drives
DAILY a super beetle...not many would undertake that unless it was
warm and reliable.

zzz...who believes proper self diagnosis of van and self is both
economical and wise.
