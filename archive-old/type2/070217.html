&gt; My '78 bus has a dead 'fridg by Dometik. There is an inverter under the back

&gt; to confirm that assertion please?

Oh no.  I was assuming that there was some kind of adapter that converted 120V AC to 12V 
DC when using city power and when running on battery it just used the battery's 12V DC.  
I guess I'll have to get my meter out and test those fridge connections to be sure.  If 
it is an inverter then my plans of just plugging a cigarette lighter into the connections 
for the fridge which I removed will become a bit more complicated.

&gt; Seems to me efficiency is key, since 4 hours of wimpy cooling before your
&gt; battery poops out is unacceptably lame in my opinion.
&gt; 

I second that notion.
