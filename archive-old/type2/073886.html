Subject: Re: [T2] Question on Heat/Air Knobs

Reply to: naskeet_at_hotmail_dot_com

The red heater lever knobs for the 1974 model, differ from those of the 
pre-1974 models, which are metal &amp; rubber, with a different fitting, so 
cannot be interchanged unless one also transplants the corresponding levers 
from behind the dashboard instrument panel.

If you don't want to do this you will need 1974 or later, one-piece plastic 
heater knobs.

Regards.

&gt;Subject: [T2] Question on Heat/Air Knobs
&gt;Date: Thu, 1 Nov 2001 17:14:24 -0500
&gt;
&gt;I have a 74 and a friend found some Heat/Air knobs off his 72 or 73 (he
&gt;can't remember which).
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know if they are interchangeable with the 74? If he lived
&gt;around the corner, I'd just drive and find out...but he's a few states away
&gt;and will ship them to me if I can use them. But making him send them to me
&gt;unnecessarily is not a nice thing to do.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance,
&gt;
