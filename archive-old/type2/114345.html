&gt;Hey guys,
&gt;       
&gt;        The foam that surrounds the tin-work in my Bus is completely
&gt;shot. I'd like to replace it, but I want it to be something that provides
&gt;a little bit more of a seal. Are there any after market replacements for
&gt;these? What about something possibly made of rubber? The one that I have
&gt;disintegrates with a mere touch of the finger. Is there a better
&gt;alternative? I assume a new one won't be this weak, obviously, but how
&gt;long do they normally last?

They don't last 10 years, especially if you disturb them, maybe less. I put my third one (2nd replacement) in last year.

Just get a new OE seal from BD.
