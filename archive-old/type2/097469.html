Subject: Re: [T2] Fly Cut or Step Cut?

Kevin:

I assume these are original VW heads?  In that case I *think* that a flycut
only dresses up the contact point between the head and the thick metal
&quot;gasket&quot; that VW installed between the head and the cylinder.  The new heads
being manufactured (not by VW) have this &quot;gasket&quot; as part of the casting,
obviating the need for the gasket.  I believe a step cut mimics this
machining more material out of the center portion of the head, leaving a
small &quot;step&quot; around the outer circumference of the head.  (Somebody will
correct me if I'm wrong here!)  I don't think one is better than the other
for cooling or unleaded gas.
