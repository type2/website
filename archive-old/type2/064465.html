Re: FS-'75 Westy Poptop, $5885
jonathan was musing about the high price of a '75 Westy that was posted FS.
hmm, Do buses that need body work and all that really go for this much out
west? and the appliances may not work?

Ellis says,
You can still get a very nice bus for that price! In fact I have just
installed a new clutch/PP/T.O. Bearing and rear main seal into the '81 that
was FS earlier this Summer. The third gear synchronizer has also been done.
Fresh push rod seals, lifters (reprimed) and tune-up as of June, '96. This
is a SOLID never hit, no rust, running and driving 7psgr bus with all seats
and receipts. Drive it to Maine if you wanna! Open AZ title $2750 obo (very
obo) Phoenix, AZ. Call (602)224-8085 wk or (602)285-4693 hm.
