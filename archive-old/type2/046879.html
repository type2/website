Subject: [T2] RE: '71 bus for sale in texas

    Volks,
        About a week ago I posted my bus for sale. I now have a link to some 
pictures of it. Go to photopoint_dot_com and enter my e-mail address 
(sjsh4601_at_cs_dot_com) where it says friends e-mail and click &quot;visit&quot;. Then once 
you are on my album page click on the category &quot;friends&quot;. I am asking $ 2000 
for this bus (or offers as low as $1800). This bus has quite a few new parts 
on it.
        Strong engine with new pistons,cylinders,heads,carb,blue coil,009 
distr.,generator,regulator and plug wires. Contrary to what some people have 
said on this list about rebuilt motors, this is a strong running bus. It has 
been my daily driver since March.   
        Also new front calipers,master cylinder,rear wheel cylinders and 
rubber brake lines. Body is very straight with some very small sections of 
rust (2-3 inches square) on the rockers. The reason I am selling it is 
because I injured my back and have not been able to work since July. And I 
need the money as things are starting to get kind of tight.
        If you are interested, please let me know and I will e-mail my phone 
# to you. Then we can discuss it further. This bus is located in the Lubbock 
TX. area, about 120 miles of south Amarillo.
    
        Thanks for your time

                        Steve Stovall
