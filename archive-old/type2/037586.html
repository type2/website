Subject: Re: Chrome trim piece needed

Left and right are NOT the same!  The angle is different. Not the curve
around the corner but how it sits on the body. Lay a left and a right
together and you will see the pitch is different. Remove the clips from your
body and lay your chrome piece on each corner. It will fit perfectly on one
side and be away from the body [top edge] on the other side.

Which side do you need?



&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Am missing just 1 corner &quot;chrome&quot; trim piece from a deluxe '71 bus.  Its
&gt; the curved corner piece nest to the rear cargo door. Either side since
&gt; their interchangeable.  Anybody have any ?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
