Subject: fairly sudden gearshift slop on '70 bus?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.PTX.4.05.9903170832260.15155-100000_at_odin.cc.pdx_dot_edu&gt;


Hi folks:

This problem has just cropped up, gradually over the last few weeks, or so
it feels: The gearshift lever seems to have a lot more side-to-side play
in my hand, and at the same time it's become harder to &quot;find&quot; reverse,
1st, and 2nd.  It doesn't have to be forced, I just have to hunt around
very carefully to find the gear.  Doesn't grind going in/out of gear,
doesn't pop out of gear once it's in, and going back and forth between 3rd
and 4th feels about the same as always.

Don't know if these details matter, but just in case: 

When starting out in the morning, it's always [i.e., for the 3 years I've
had it] been a little fussy about finding 2nd from 1st or 3rd, or
downshifting from 2nd to 1st, though that only lasts for about the first
half-mile, then it's always worked fine.  The type-2 archive had a few
posts from a couple of years ago [hi, Gregor!] with that same condition,
though no one seemed to red-flag it at the time.

Clutch was replaced 2 years ago.  I tightened the cable about a month ago,
roughly the same time that I began to notice this problem, but I honestly
couldn't say if the adjustment came before, during, or after the onset of
the shifter problem; I just noticed the play in the pedal and fixed it.

Any advice would be welcome. 

Thanks in advance.
