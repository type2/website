&gt; insidious way.&quot;  Such

Good post, Todd. Yes, the smog pump does dilute the gases somewhat, but 
that was not their real purpose. As the gases leave the combustion 
chambers, fresh air is injected. This allows the mix to continue to 
burn, reducing hydrocarbon levels sugnificantly. Add a catalytic 
converter, and some emmisions are reduced even further.

You bring up a good point here. We are measuing parts per million, not 
the total volume of polutants produced. Quite simply, tubes could be run 
from the exhaust pipe(s), through a &quot;wind mill&quot;, giving the volume of 
exhaust produced. If calculated against the PPM, this would give the 
total emmisions levels for a given vehicle.

It's always seemed odd to me that these big 4WD PUs, getting 8 mpg, are 
weighted the same in tests as the Geo getting 5 times the mileage. All 
things being even, the PU is producing 5 times the polution... to ferry 
a single user back and forth to work. 

If we are truly worried about polution, wouldn't it make more sense to 
produce small, energy efficient cars? They require fewer materials to 
build, and produce fewer emmisions per user mile. With this in mind, a 
retrofitted beetle might be a &quot;bargain&quot; in disguise.
