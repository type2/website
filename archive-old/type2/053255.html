Jerry, I just hate to see such a cool bus leave the US.  I don't have the $ 
to invest in it.  Can't rescue every bus I see I guess.

I'm sorry the VW folks have given you a hard time.  Sems to me that at the 
hobbyist/lifestyle level, bus folks are really cool.  Once you get to 
'professional' status (try and make $ at it), often something changes.  
There's something that happens to folks once money gets involved.  Could 
also be that the 'me generation' got into busses because of an 'image 
thing'.

The flack you got for giving an award last winter was uncalled for.  Hey, it 
was your award to give as you saw fit.  I must say in defense of the lists 
though that when someone asks for help, they get it.  There is still hope 
for the bus folks.

I saw the posts about Bessie.  I stay out of the 'someone bashing', hoping 
that someday people might grow up.  Don't seem to be happening.  It's too 
bad.  Busses are a dying breed due to accidents, corrosion, and not caring 
about old cars.

I have been watching as busses have been staging somewhat of a comeback 
lately.  My busses are worth more than I can afford to replace them.  I am 
so happy every day when I walk out the door and see them both waiting in the 
morning.  As the value and awareness grows, the probability that someone is 
going to want to steal them grows.  But I'm not going to lock them up in a 
garage and never drive them.

I have learned from driving them that there isn't anything really worth 
being in a hurry about, and if I just relax, and take it easy, I'll see cool 
stuff that the folks in their luxospeedmobiles miss.  Life ain't the 
destination, it's the journey.

As far as the list giving you a hard time, I dunno.  I've seen the folks get 
all fired up, not always knowing the whole story.  That's the trouble with 
this form of communication.  An old tune comes to mind, part of which goes 
&quot;if you mind your own business then you won't be minding mine..&quot;

I guess I'm asking you to hang in there.  You've been an inspiration to many 
of us with your tireless pursuit of saving as many busses as you can.  It's 
unfortunate that a few have given you a hassle.  I tend to feel sorry for 
those folks that self-aggrandize at the expense of others.  What an awful 
way to live your life.  Sure seems to be a lot of them out there though 
isn't there?

Dave--I do not have much choice?  They are the only ones showing money!!
Hopefully i'm working on one American buyer--Drakula has been for sale for a 
few
months--
you will find it here-- http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/   It is a reluctant
sale--Melissa and i have really been beat up in the VW hobby this past 
year--It
is time to move on--Some of the stories about us--and the fact that Melissa 
was
threatened at Pomona by a member of a very prominent West Coast Cal look
club--for selling some poor imitation club stickers of their club--that we 
DID
NOT make--Melissa was told that this member and this club would ruin her
business thru the internet!!  i have also been harassed about Bessie thru 
the
type II listing--Things about dirty hippies! i saved the bus from being cut 
up!!
the list goes on and on!! VERY prominent members of the type II list have 
come
after me and Bessie--i could go on and
on--http://www.5thworld_dot_net/livingfolklore/HTML/bessie.htm
This is NOT a friendly hobby!  TWWM, uj

 &gt; What are you doing?  Sending Dracula to Japan??!!  That's Un-American!!!  
I
 &gt; forget if you offered it to listees first or not.  I'll trade you the
 &gt; Burrito Express for it and maybe other items.  I'd offer cash but I'm
 &gt; getting ready to retire from the Service (you don't get rich workin' fer
 &gt; Uncle Sam).  What can I do to ensure such a cool bus stays here?  I 
showed
 &gt; the pix in the VW mag's 50th anniversary issue and my wife thought it was
 &gt; the coolest bus going!  We do Halloween is a BIG way and I'm not against
 &gt; making a hearse a daily driver.  Hell I always wanted a 'Cadaverlac'!
