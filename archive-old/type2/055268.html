Subject: engine wiring

Hey Volks!
        Installed a donor engine('73) into my '74 Westy...one small
problem...the wires from the alternator have been CUT!...Got the big red hot
wire from the solenoid figured out and hooked up to the alt. but am left
with 4 small leftover wires...red black green and brown...any ideas?

(took the rusty donor to the scrapyard--anyone ever seen a type 2 flying
through the air?)
