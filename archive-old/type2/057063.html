Subject: Sagging rear (not mine!!)

Hello List!!

  Well, I'm ready to start the transplants, and not a day too soon!! While
driving back from the camping trip, I notice a whole bunch of oil spray on
the back of the bus. Pulled over and found a pretty good leak coming from
the oil cooler. 1 1/2 quarts later, made it home, so this week I'll start
the transfer. 

 What I'm needing info about is will it make it eaiser to readjust the
spring plate while the engine is out or should I do it with the new motor
in? The sagging rear looks like it is going to make me jack the bus in
order to remove the old engine and install the new one. 

 I'm also wanting to replace the oil seals in both engines. Does the case
need to be seperated to replace the front and rear main seals? 

Thanks in advance!!!
