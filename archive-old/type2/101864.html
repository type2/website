Subject: dual carb logic

hey group, I'm troubled with a question.....  My 74 single cab runs 
perfectly but I have to turn the idle screw (big screw) on the left carb 
all the way in to get it to idle at 875 +/-....I have an SVDA distributor 
on this baby, therefore the timing is set at 7.5 BTDC.   Logic is telling 
me that if I had the dual vac distributor on it, which would retard the 
timing at idle, I'd get more adjustment out of my big idle screw on the 
left carb, since at idle, the retard would slow the engine down allowing me 
to turn the idle speed screw open some to speed it up.  My assumption 
is:  since I have the SVDA distributor,  I don't have near the idle speed 
adjustment as I would have if I had the proper dual vac distributor.  Is 
this assumption correct?  Am I causing any harm by driving with the idle 
speed screw screwed all the way in?  The truck seems to be very 
happy.  tia, Greg
