&gt;The main thing that determines the waste heat energy produced by the
&gt;engine is the amount of power that the engine is producing.  This is
&gt;true regardless of the engine RPM.  The heat produced will be the same
&gt;whether the engine is making 40 hp at 2000RPM or 40 hp at 4000RPM.

Right.  There might be minor differences (presumably more frictional losses
at higher rpms for a given power output, for instance) but for all
practical purposes the above is true.

&gt;If there is less air flow, then there must be a greater temperature
&gt;difference between the heads and the air to transfer the same amount
&gt;of heat energy.  The heads must run hotter to transfer the same heat
&gt;energy.

This is painfully obvious if you have a Cylinder Head Temperature (CHT)
gauge.  I can see a 50 degree drop in CHT just by downshifting while
maintaining the same speed up a hill.
