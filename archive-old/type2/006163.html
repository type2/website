Having trouble finding the 4 boots that hang a Weber progressive onto the
manifold crosspipes on my 77 2L. They're 1 1/2&quot; long, and step down from 1
3/4&quot; to 1 3/8&quot; and are made of rubber or neophrene or (technical alert) that
other stuff..aged brain fails me this time of night. Weber dealer on web
says they're called &quot;dual port manifold boots&quot;. Anyway._dot_can't seem to get up
on Bus Depot catalogue tonight.

Any ideas for a source?

Formerly sweet running engine went caplooie this weekend, due to sudden
failure...you can almost see through the &quot;rubber&quot;..of 2 of these boots,
leaning out the mixture greatly. If you have them, might want to check for
beginning signs of failure..which I obviously missed :(

TIA, Marv Krupp 74/77 cheapie camper..the one ailing/72
