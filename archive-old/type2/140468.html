Subject: Re: [T2] The mystery Single Cab

From: &quot;Jon Stiles&quot;:

What is weird is that it is a numbers matching 71. It even has the brake
booster plate on the front beam but it has never been used. The beam itself hasn't been removed. Also the dash
doesn't have a cigarette lighter and the headlight switch is on the left of the steering column.

It is possible, my 70 Double Cab had a 68 front beam with a 68 master
cylinder (since corrected).

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

You cannot go by the front beam. It sounds like it has been replaced with a new one.

211 401 061 M, 1970 and up. For 1971 and up with power brakes, you need to also get 211 401 213 mounting. Then
VW subbed the beam to part number 211 401 061 N for 1970 to the end of 1979, comes with the servo bracket
already installed.

Now your 1970 DC..... no way it could have a 68 beam bolted 100% in it.

211 401 061 K, 1968 to the end of 1969.

The mounting holes are totally different. Only 2 of the 4 holes on each side line up.
Center-to-center:
The top 2 holes are 4.75&quot; apart on both early and late beams.
The bottom 2 holes are 6.456&quot; apart on the 68/68 beam.
The bottom 2 holes are 8.125&quot; apart on the 70/79 beam.

The distance from the top 2 to the bottom 2 on early: 3.5328&quot;
The distance from the top 2 to the bottom 2 late: 4.7066&quot;

Going back to that mystery Single Cab.

Tell me about the fuse box in it.
Look up under the dash, above the headlight, has 3 relays hanging out the bottom, and on the top edge it has
numbers on it. What are they?
70 bus = 411 937 505 A
71 bus = 411 937 505 B
72 bus = 411 937 505 C

You can swap vins and titles, but you can't swap a A fusebox for a B fusebox!
