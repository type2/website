Subject: 091 clutch release arm lever???

      Does anyone have a  091 clutch release arm lever --- the lever
that fits on the shaft which operates the throw-out bearing -- for
cables? I just put a 091 bellhousing on my 002 tranny, it had a
hydraulic slave cylinder on it before, and the clutch lever from the 002
tranny doesn't fit the shaft of the 091 bellhousing.
