&gt;i couldnt see how anyone could replace the cable without replacing 
&gt;the hose.  or maybe im not looking hard enough.  anybody out there 
&gt;know how this works?

You've already guessed correctly.  The new cable will have all the
rubber stuff on it and you just slip it all into place.

Good luck!
