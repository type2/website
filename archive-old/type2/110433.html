&lt;&lt; This weekend on Car Talk, a caller was asking for input on a van she could

live in during an extended road trip. She was interested in the Bus and the

Car Talk guys actually agreed with her! I guess they forgot that the VW Bus

was #10 on the 10 Worst Cars of the Millenium

You didn't listen to the whole show...They said to buy a real car and tow
the van for sleeping... ;-)
