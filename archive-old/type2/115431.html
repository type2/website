Subject: Re: [T2] hubcap question

&gt;but now of course i have the 'wide 5' pattern with the half-
&gt;moon hubcaps. this might seem like a stupid question, but
&gt;how are those little tabs that hold the hubcaps on
&gt;repaired?

Since I didn't see a response to this one...
There are repair kits for the wheels that contain those tabs, AND the rivets 
to attatch them to the wheel with.

Eron
