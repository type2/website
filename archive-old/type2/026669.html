Jeff, please forgive me if this is too basic, but it may help others if not
you. :-)   I assume you have a short somewhere, probably draining the juice
while the bus sits, rather than while you're driving it.  If so, then I
would try disconnecting the battery every time it sits to see if this makes
a difference.  The first thing I do for finding shorts is to remove the
positive battery cable and check for a current between it and the battery.
A multimeter works best, but in a pinch, I just rub the cable end over the
positive terminal and check for little sparks (this won't work in full
daylight, it needs to be dark to really see the sparks).  (Don't do this if
you smell any gas fumes!)  Remove the fuse for your radio as the
clock/presets will mess you up.  If there are any sparks/current, I pull
each fuse (one at a time) and check again until the sparks/current leakage
stops.  This tells me which circuit the short is in.  (Electrical schematics
really useful here.)  I trace the wires in that circuit until I find the
short using an ohmmeter (battery disconnected).  This almost always works
for me, unless the short only exists in an electrical part when it is turned
on.  You may have to play with switches and relays using the ohmmeter for
these circuits.  However, if the engine is running, the battery should stay
charged even with a short.  Any short strong enough to drain the battery
while the engine is running will show up in your charging light and also
blow a fuse.  Therefore, for me, this has always been the one component that
has no fuses and isn't used once the alternator kicks in-the starter.  One
of the things starters often do before they die is suck way too much juice
than they should and drain the battery.  You may not be able to tell this is
happening as the engine may start right up.  ...Electrical shorts are one of
the most frustrating things to find, but you always find em eventually and
it feels great when you do!  Good Luck.
