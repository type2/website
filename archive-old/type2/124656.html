Subject: Re: [T2] Starting Problems

From: --kevin--



 Yesterday I'm out running errands and the bus is starting and running 
 fine. At the end of the evening I stop by a friend's house to take the 
kids swimming. After about an hour of water, we go to leave and the bus 
 won't start. I get no oil or battery light at the first click of the key 
 on the ignition. If I leave the key at starting position, the lights 
 warm up after a few seconds and then glow dimly. Fortunately my friend 
 lives at the top of a hill and I can pop the clutch, get it started and 
 runs fine all the way home.

Sounds like the infamous dead cell symtom.

You need a new battery.
