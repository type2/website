Subject: engines and engine bay paint etc

Volks,
    Isolde is currently undergoing a major rear end makeover- I think I can
understand where the expression 'looking like the back end of a bus' came
from.  My main concern is the engine bay, and the tin ware.  The engine
dropped a valve this summer, and is due for replacement, and so my questions
on the subject are- does anyone have a volkspares engine in their bus, are
they any good? There's a rebuild company called MVW in London (UK) which are
cheaper, but I'd rather go with a big name- is that rational?  I am not a
high mileage user, just want something that goes, and runs unleaded.
    Secondly, on the subject of paint.  I am thinking of giving the engine
bay a lick of hammerite just brush on.  Will this be okay, or are there
special non-flammable paints I should be using.  Are there any favourites
for painting engine tin with?
    I noticed some talk about Just Kampers, a UK distributor biased towards
campers.  I have spent very large amounts of money with them, and can highly
recommend them, very helpful people, there aren't many mail order companies
that send you write thing when you describe a part as &quot;that pin thingy that
goes in between the brake and the jobby&quot;.  Thanks for your help- hope
everyone's not freezing in their buses too much,
    cheers
        Tristan and Isolde
