Subject: RE: [T2] Rude people   was Re: [T2] Paint question - Thanks

I think too often &quot;pro's&quot; belittle other people unintentionally by thinking
they are doing the right thing by just correcting the average persons
choices.  I know that there are folks on this list that could wet the floor
down drop a coat of primer on a vehicle the &quot;right way&quot; and just go on like
it is drinking a cup of coffee. And while always using the right products is
the right thing for you, and ultimately the correct thing to do, it is not
always practical.  You don't always know the purpose or intended use of the
vehicle being painted.  What if while being expensive in the long run $3 a
can is a much easier way to finance the paint job?  It's hard I know when
you know the correct way to do something, to just answer the question at
hand and merely suggest a better way to go rather than just telling someone
they are screwing up and wrong, wrong, wrong.   It happens with most of us
in our own little thing.  On this list it is the pro's of paint, or engine
work...  but hey I build high-impact HTML and Flash sites for a living, and
you don't see me picking apart any of the free-hosters or Type-2 related
sites out there do you?  It's tough not to make a suggestion to someone
about why their menu bar is wrong, or works poorly, or just looks and acts
like 6-year-old technology.  But, while I had my hands on this keyboard, and
my creative mind dipped into the crazy crap I can manipulate those little
pixels to do...  you had your hand on a paint gun, or a MIG Welder, or an
accounting program, or an airbrush, or a soldering gun, or whatever.  My
only real point is please don't push when I nudge will do just fine.  I'm
sure that the &quot;rattle-can&quot; folks out there don't want you to look over all
of their past mistakes to answer their question...    in this case it was
&quot;why did I get these results&quot; not &quot;why do you think my paint idea is not
good&quot;.  I just think that an answer to the question being posed, followed by
a &quot;by the way you may know this...  but perhaps a better way to go would be&quot;
as opposed to &quot;I feel sorry for the next guy stuck with the problems you
cause&quot; type answer.

While this is technically &quot;off-topic&quot; I felt I needed to say something
seeing as how I just posted a paint related question.  Believe me I welcome
opinions about how I could do it.  I have some limitations, and I'll have no
problem naming them.  I just want to be sure that those clicking the reply
button know the following:  I'd like to see helpful insight, suggestions, or
recommendations about where to find my answers.  I don't need anyone telling
me that I bought a junk bus and that if I knew anything I'd be better off
scrapping it and just trying again.  That is not the type of answer I opened
myself up to, and rattle-can folks want to know what they can do to make
their path better...  not how to be the target of a good paint sermon, or
how many problems their choice is going to cause people down the line.


My $.10 because I had no pennies.

And every once in a while some newbie, like me, comes to the list
happy, relieved, maybe a bit excited because he dropped his first engine,
rebuilt her first carb, fix a pop top, purchased their first bus, or even
got
the paint to not look like crap.  And what happens?!?!?  Some big mouth
has to come along and tell us everything we did wrong and how it's just
going to break again tomorrow.
