Hi all,

     A few questions about my 79 w/ 2.0l &amp; stock FI.  My fuel pump is
whining &amp; it is making me nervous.  The pressure checks out at 28PSI w/ the
hose on &amp; 35PSI with the hose off, just as Bentley says it should be.  It
does fluctuate as I rev the engine but I assume it is normal.  What would
you all do?  I have never had one whine so I am not really sure.

     Second problem is a surge while accelerating.  Just seems to gently
surge or buck as I go up through the gears &amp; while trying to maintain a
constant freeway speed.  I have new points, condenser, plugs, cap &amp; rotor.
The spark plug wires are all fine.  Timing &amp; dwell is to specs.  I can not
find any vacuum leaks with spraying carb cleaner on all the various places.
New AFM about 1 1/2 years ago by PO.  All small vacuum hoses have been
replaced.  Any ideas?  Thanks.
