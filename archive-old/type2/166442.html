Subject: New panel clips, drill size? Plastic sheeting on front doors.

&gt;1. What drill size should I use for the new panel clips?

I wouldn't know.  The old holes and panel clips are still
working in my bus.  Sorry.

&gt;2. I need to replace the plastic sheeting behind the panels. Are these

&gt;available new, or can I make my own? I know they need to be 2 layers,
&gt; but since
&gt;I dont have an original to go by, I need to know where the second
layer
&gt;is attached.

I guess my old plastic sheeting was so rotton I didn't
notice that it was two-ply.  I replaced them last year
with new one-ply sheets (in both my cars).

The Ace hardware store in my 'hood has what looks like
plastic tablecloth sold by the yard.  Gingham, checkers,
etc.  I chose the clear stuff and brush on contact cement.
Spray on contact cement would make a mess and attract dirt.
Taped the sheet to the door and then used a Sharpie pen
to trace the outline and cut with scissors. I put a patch
of 2&quot; shipping tape on the plastic sheet where a hole goes
(window crank) to toughen the area.

Before you glue the sheeting down, check and lube the
window regulator and clear the drainage at the bottom of
the door.  Best of luck,
