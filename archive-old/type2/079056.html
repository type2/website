Subject: Re: [T2] Plugging oil galley

I've got more than just a pasing interest in this.
What would the process of taping the galleries be called so I can scan
the archives?
I've got a newly rebuilt TYPE IV engine on my bench and I'd like to make
this modification while its on the bench.
I was surprised that it wasn't mentioned in Tom Wilsons book or other
repair manuals I've got.

&gt; Couple years ago.  Had to scramble to put it back together so just
&gt; loctited it in and re-peened the case.  I've got to pull the motor 
&gt; again
&gt; and will not be in quite the rush I was in last time so now's the 
&gt; time
&gt; to fix it right.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, with the plug out, it'll put 4 qts of oil on the ground in ten 
&gt; seconds.
