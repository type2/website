Subject: Re: [T2] Air COOLed

&gt; Do you have a 72-79 bus with power assisted brakes? If you're having
&gt; problems with idle when braking then it might be a vacuum issue.

In fact, check for ANY vacuum leaks.

I'm having a similar issue, but it's definitely not my booster. How do
I know for sure? The connections to the intake manifolds are
disconnected and plugged. ;)

I thought I had sealed up the doohickeys on my intake manifolds that
control some emissions function with silicone. But I stuck a (gasp)
condom on them and it sucked in. So there's still leaks there.

I tried to remove the ones from some spare manifolds I have here so I
could see why they fail and maybe JBWeld them shut from the inside.
But I broke my wrench on them!! I couldn't believe how tightly they're
stuck in. So for now I'm just going to JBWeld around the ones on my
bus and see if that holds better than the silicone did.

I'm about ready to take a pair of manifolds to a machine shop to have
them removed and welded shut. :-|
