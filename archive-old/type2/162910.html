&gt;I may be looking at a bare metal
&gt;inside and out job



	I've not painted a bus yet, but am taking a keen interest in 
the various approaches sketched on this list as I intend to paint 
mine (outside).
	I doubt bare metal is nearly so good as factory-baked paint. 
Some of the newer primers have now been banned; I seriously doubt 
modern primers will grip the metal as well as the original.  If 
you've got original paint on some large area, do explore just sanding 
that to provide *purchase* or *key* for new enamel.
	Regarding rust, I had been misinformed that Altex Devoe is a 
USA-based firm; it turns out to be only Australasia.  It is quite 
possible a W. Coast painter might import some RIPO which  -  after 
removal of flaky rust  -  is fully capable of embalming rust 
indefinitely, as long as running water doesn't get at it.
I plan to visit the HQ (ca.100 mi from me) on my running-in trip with 
my rebuilt engine, and will exhort the CEO to export RIPO to selected 
USA agents.
	Will keep youse posted.

R
