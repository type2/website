Subject: 1800 help

Well I finally got the junkyard 1800 engine together and put into my bus
(74 Westy). got everything hooked up and cant get it to start. ItThe
timing appears to be set correctly, as do the valves. There is good
spark, gas is getting to the carb (single Weber).  It will fire back
through the carb and puff a little smoke out of the exhaust, but thats
it. The intake runners are very hot after trying to start it as well.  
Can anyone suggest anything I might check?

My other question is aboooooooooout the valves. When I went to set them I
could not get any slack in the rockers, I had to hold down the bottom of
the arms while I adjusted the clearance.  Is there simething messed up
there?

Thanks in advance,
