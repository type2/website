Subject: Re: [T2] tire size

215 is 3cm wider tha the OEM size (185mm)
/70 is a smaller aspect ratio compared to /82 (the OEM size)

the stock tire has a circumference of (14inch + 18.5 cm * 0.82 ) * 2pi
= 125.19 inch
this tire has (14inch + 21.5 cm * 0.70 ) * 2pi = 123.18 inch

So the &quot;big&quot; tire is actually smaller in circumference.
What is the load rating on this tire ? (this is the deal braker)

And one typically likes to run thin tires in winter, fat tires are
only good on dry roads.

&gt; &gt;  Got a friend who is giving me 2 new snow tires for free. The size is
215/70x14. Is this too big for a bus?
