&gt; As I was thinking about this thread today, I thought: I'll bet that
&gt; Atwell either already has a tire balancer, or he's going to get one.
&gt; It's just a matter of time before there's a description on the website.


My father in law mounts his own tires. Not on his wife's car, but his own. 

He breaks the seal by putting the deflated tire flat on the ground and
putting a bumper jack under his old Ford full size truck. Jacking up
the truck puts enough pressure on to break the bead.

After working around both sides of the tire in that manner, he then
uses a greased up old tire iron (pry bar) to pop it off the rim. Steel
rims, so no worry about damaging delicate alloys.

Installation is the reverse of removal, sans jack. 

He has a floor balancer which is basically a round bubble level on a
swiveling platform to set the rim on. Adds weights until the bubble is
centered.

Now, high speed driving with this kind of balance is an adventure. You
never know if it was balanced precisely enough or not. Some jobs have
been horrible at anything over 50mph, others have been beautiful.

Me? I prefer to have a shop spin balance my tires.
