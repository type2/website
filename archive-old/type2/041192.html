&lt;&lt; I'm not saying you're wrong, but many 72-79 heads (almost every one I've
seen) came with 8mmx8mm studs (non-stepped).  VW used the 8x9mm studs to
replace pulled studs - that's what they gave me when VW botched the install
of the LeCoz heat exchangers on my bus.  I didn't install them though - I
decided to go directly to 8x10mm studs instead.  I seem to remember the
length being about 2.75 inches but I'm not sure.

By the way, I took the right heat exchanger off of my bus a couple of weeks
ago.  It is a Dansk which I received as part of the LeCoz heat exchanger
swap thing a couple of years ago.  The flange for cylinder 2 was loose -
the welds holding it to the pipe had completely cracked off.  Cylinder 1's
flange was cracked but not loose yet.  Looking down the cylinder one pipe,
the flange piece is seriously mismatched with the pipe.  It is offset to
the side by about 3/16&quot; so that there is a ridge in the path of the
exhaust.  Probably not enough of a deterrent to flow to cause a problem,
but I am upset by the lack of quality.

Also, the right heat exchanger for some reason hangs down lower than the
left one.  Looking at the bus from the rear, the muffler is angled down to
the right.  I checked that the heater boxes are seating properly (they are)
and now I'm wondering if the tubes are simply longer on one side.

David, I posted a couple of weeks ago, about the exact same problem with my 
&quot;Lecoz&quot; exchangers.  I replaced the left side with a new Dansk from 
JCWhitney, and it was higher than the lecoz unit.  My S&amp;S header system which 
fit wonderfully before the replacement, took a bit of fiddling with to get it 
to fit, and the muffler rubs on the bumper bracket.

Now, as for the exhaust studs.  My FLAPS says that 8x9 is original, and my 
virgin original '74 1800 has 8x9 on all exhaust studs.  This engine has never 
been apart before I removed a few studs off of it so I could convert my 8x10s 
to helicoils.  I swapped out the original motor when it developed valve guide 
problems at 125,000 miles, and kept it in my garage for parts or future 
rebuild.

I could be wrong, or it's even possible that late 70's bus heads used the 
8x8s.
