&gt; Dunno how long term oil magnet would change things (w/o filter).  Muir did

Problem with magnetic drain plugs is that they extend too far into the
hole and interfere with the bottom of the strainer.  Second problem is
that the area above the drain plug is a stagnent area, flow-wise.  All the
action is above the strainer.
