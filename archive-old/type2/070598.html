Indeed, a big thanks to all that attended. There were over twenty 
buses at this informal event and with the exception of some spilled 
beer I think all had a good time.

If you missed there are a few pics on Rob's site

My next big idea is not so much mine but has come up from time to 
time among several folks: Cape Hatteras event. Roughly everyone meet 
in Swanquarter,NC to take the ferry over to the island, check out a 
lighthouse or two and then camp, swim etc. Head up the cape and see 
some more lighthouses, Wright Bros. Mem etc. Camp some more etc etc. 
This might be best done in late summer or early fall as the bugs are 
rough out that way. Anyone wanna spearhead this operation?
