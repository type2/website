Subject: Re: [T2] paint for cylinders.

My paint experience,

I have always used flat black BBQ paint and just misted the fins .
Still looks good after 25,000 miles....

Seems to have helped...maybe too well sometimes...I have a T1 engine now 
that at 50 degrees outside, I can't get it past 180 degree oil temps even 
after 25 miles on the interestate at 80mph(4000rpm).

Same engine will only get up to 208 degrees in the summer(95 degrees) 
after the same run....1776cc/009/kadrons/32 degrees total advance...


Check this article though

http://www.offroadvw_dot_net/tech/tech.html

scroll down the page and read the black paint for cooling article.

For you folks with upright engines...be sure and checkthe fan article as 
well.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I'm doing the top end on my 75 and was going to give the cylinders a

&gt; but don't know whether or not this is adequate for the cylinders.

&gt; 
&gt; May I solicit recommendations for good paint for my fresh from the
&gt; machine shop cylinders (why do I feel like such the dirty old man when I
&gt; refer to them as jugs...)?
