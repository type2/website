Subject: Re: which way to face CV on axle....

Thanks for the help. New CV's fitted and the horrible noise is gone!! Well
almost, the wheel bearings are next, but that will have to wait a while.
I just got back from on of the local VW's shows here in Brisbane, 'Dubs by
the Pub' close to 400 VW's in all categories. What a day!!
Unfortunately Andy never won any prises, but to me he was the best Kombi at
the show!
Richard,
Australia
