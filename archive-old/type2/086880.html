Subject: Re: [T2] Front Axle Beam - Welds on torsion leaves.

&gt; Yet another round in finishing the front axle beam installation, with much
&gt; grunting and hammering and very little (forward) progress.  So far, the
&gt; old beam is off, the new beam is on and the thru-beam stuff (brakes,
&gt; shifte, clutch cable, etc.) is back on.  Today was supposed to be putting
&gt; the trailing arms and steering gear back together.  Seven hours later, I
&gt; have the upper arms on.  Tho they are much more difficult to get off/on
&gt; than the lowers, they are usually *not* this kind of a problem.  Read
&gt; on...

hmmmm, dejavu all over again, just did this job about two months ago
&gt; 
&gt; When we removed the torsion leaves from Jeff Stewart's old beam, the welds
&gt; had popped on both sets.  Since John was there with his arc welder, he ran
&gt; a bead of weld back across one end of each set.  At the time, it seemed a
&gt; wise thing to do.  It certainly made inserting the set thru the center
&gt; fixture in the beam a whole lot easier to have all the leaves welded
&gt; together Today, however, I ran into a serious down-side to this.  As a
&gt; result, in the strongest possible terms, let me say:
&gt; 
&gt; If you re-weld the leaves of a set of torsion springs, make *sure* the
&gt; weld is confined to the end face!  If you get *any* weld on the leaves,
&gt; even a little tiny bit... It is gonna cause you immense grief later!

I just put a straight bead up the center of the outside edge of the
torsion leaves
&gt; 
&gt; started on the welded ends!  There may also have been a tiny alignment
&gt; problem, I don't know.  One thing for certain, weld is harder than a
&gt; hardened file.  I attacked with a Sears triangular file for half an hour
&gt; and made no discernable progress :-(

angle grinder is the only thing that works, ask me how I know?

&gt; I am torn.  On the one hand, it is FAR easier to get a welded set into the
&gt; beam, on th eother, this does you no good if you can't get the trailing
&gt; arms onto them.  I guess I still reccommend welding, but I warn you... BE
&gt; CAREFUL!  the tolerances are *very* tight. Grind off the sides and corners
&gt; to be sure the end will slip on.  And try a trailing arm for size/fit
&gt; before you install the torsion set in the beam!

had exactly the opposite results, fought with em for hours finally welded
the #$*&amp;_at_( things and they (sort of)went right in.

&gt; On a last, and semi-humorous note... the garage I am working in is all of
&gt; two feet wider than the bus.  The torsion set is three feet long.  Angling
&gt; that set in and out was its own little slice of pain, fersure!

ohhh I know your garage that must have been loads of fun, don't have that
problem, have to work outside..

&gt; When I speak my requirements in a house, I start with, &quot;Well, a heated,
&gt; eight foot tall, two car garage...&quot; and go on from there.  Y'all will

dream the impossible dream!!!!!!
