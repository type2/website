Somehow I knew this thread would get lots of air-play.

&gt;71 Bus/Transporter, immaculate, show condition, must see to appreciate,
&gt;Appraised at $45K, $38,500 or best.  858-271-2077

&gt;&gt; It would need a good bit of heavy gold plating to be worth that much.

&gt;&gt;I have *got* to see a Loaf that someone's appraised at $45k. My initial
&gt;&gt;reaction--no f'in way.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree, I think there may be a bit of marketing going on here, though,  he
&gt;&gt;&gt; says he has $47,000 invested in it, and oh yeah!  It appeared on the front
&gt;&gt;&gt; cover of vw trends, March issue.

$47K invested, Appraised for $45K . You could say that about any
Listmember's  bus, except for those lucky few of us who got in cheap and
haven't paid out *yet*. They always cost more than they're worth, unless
you're one of those people (like us) with disjointed value systems

Selling for $38K ... Well, maybe for a museum quality 23-window splitty in a
very hot market. But what's it good for if you don't own a museum?

Happy trails,
