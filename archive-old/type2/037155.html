Subject: dource for wire

Hi,
after being told that the wiring harness for my '71 is no longer available I
have realized that I am going to have to make my own.  Anybody know where I
can get the properly colored wires and approximately how much I need to
purchase.  (I am trying to patch up the taillights and engine compartment
after a fire).  Alternately, anybody have a spare section of harness?
Thanks,
Paul
