&gt;Does altitude have an effect on carbon monoxide in the exhaust?

Yes.

&gt;I noticed last
&gt;night that my Bentley for 80 to 85 Vanagons has a graph for C.O. volume % vs.
&gt;altitude in the water-cooled digijet section. There is no explanation for the
&gt;chart or reference to it in the text. The graph indicates a Co% at sea level
&gt;in a range of about .3 to 1.1, at 1640 feet the range increases to about 1.2
&gt;to 2, at 3281 feet it indicates aprox. 2.3 to 3.4 . the highest level
&gt;indicated is at 6562 feet 6.0 to 7.2 .

At 5,000 ft. above sea level, there is 14% less oxygen in a given volume of air. At 10,000 ft. that amount drops to 30% less. Not only is the engine getting less oxygen by mass it's also getting less by volume because the atompheric pressure is lower and this means the cylinders fill up with less air during each cycle

&gt;I am
&gt;curious because I live at 7000 feet and have never been able to get C.O. %
&gt;below 7.6%. My plugs typically are light brown to tan now that the engine is
&gt;broke in, indicating a reasonable A/F ratio I hope, and the engine seems to
&gt;run well. Is it that at this high altitude 7.6% is a good reading?

Seems to rich for FI at any altitude. Do you adjust the AFM using the bypass screw only? If so, you'll only tweak the %CO. You need to adjust the wiper to really dial it in:

&gt;I'm planning a trip to Phoenix later this month and plan to take my Gunson
&gt;Gastester with me. I know it is not the best device for setting A/F ratio but
&gt;it's all I have.

If that's your tester I wouldn't use it as a basis for making adjustment unless you can compare it to a calibrated tester at the shop first.
