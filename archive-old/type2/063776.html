Subject: BN4 installation

I bought a BN4 gas heater with tin work for my 74 westfalia the other   
day.  The heater is from a early 70's bus.  It doesn't seem to fit   
through the gas tank cover very well.  The tank edge is in the way and   
the tin doesn't look like it will match the  gas tank cover.   Is  there   
a different gas heater tin work for later busses or do you have to trim   
the edge of the gas tank to make it fit, kaboom!
I got the whole setup for 100 dollars,  not to bad if it works.  thanks   
  Erick
