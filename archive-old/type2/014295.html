Subject: Re: [T2] misadventures of a vw mechanic 

Had a roommate that insisted that cigarettes couldn't 
start fires with 
gasoline...

This is correct.  Had an arson investigator prove this
to me several times.  You can put a cigarette out in a
cup of gasoline. 

Really useless and dangerous information though.  I
depends on the lack of gasoline fumes, the part that
really burns, in certain conditions.  

DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!
