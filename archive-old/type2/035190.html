Subject: New Lister Looking for New Seals

Dear Walt,

I don't know where you could get those seals, but Dr. Jimmy, my hero and Gus
Bus's mechanic, manufactured a set from some old inner tubes (a source of
great hilarity at the shop). Jimmy is one resourceful dude! I haven't looked
at them myself, but they work extremely well (we are roast-toasty, no cold
air when we don't want it)!  Maybe someone else has done this too and can
give you more specifics on &quot;how to&quot;. My guess is that Jimmy made a template
out of cardboard and cut the tube from this. Hope this helps.

Chris and Gus the &quot;What's so funny about that?&quot; Bus
