Sadly not, it's about number 99 on my list of &quot;things I must get&quot;.  Someone
else who is in the club might, or you could try mailing the magazine editor
Carol Jarvis (carol.jarvis2_at_ntlworld_dot_com), she may be able to send you the
original text.  The letter doesn't have a title but is on pages 40-41 of
issue 59.
