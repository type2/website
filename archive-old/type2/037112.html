Man, you're not kidding.  I wore it on my hands and forearms (latex gloves, 
which I doubled, ripped) for about ten days.  I had to answer all sorts of 
questions in that time.  (Also, it might be nice to wear a faceshield, 
goggles still let it get on your forehead.)
I hope that it stays on the underside of my bus with the some tenacity!
I brushed it (the black).  Went on great.
