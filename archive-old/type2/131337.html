Subject: Re: [T2] Early Bay Rear Bumper - What year bus??

Rob Henley said:&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;The rubber strips are a giveaway that the bus is a European spec model. 
&gt;&gt;Here
&gt;&gt;is a brochure from the Neatherlands showing some of the early bays with 
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;rubber strips:

Thanks, Rob.

Andy said that the push button front door handles were from the '68 model.  
I can see from your linked brochure that the bus with the guy driving has 
push button door handles.  Your link indicates this is a '70 brochure.

And thanks for the pictures in the brochure that showed the jail bars.  I 
thought I was dreaming when I saw them in real life, but now I can see that 
they are from the European spec bus.   A '68??


And that right side profile of the blue bus shows the gas cap to be pretty 
much forward of what I am used to seeing.  I can open my sliding door and 
still get to fill up, but this looks like the sliding door would cover the 
gas filler pipe when it is opened.

Did ALL the European spec '68 buses have gas heaters, or just the one I 
lately came across.  It seemed like a professional, factory job.
