&gt;&gt;  Any one with a split ever actually remove 211.711.341A from a
&gt;&gt;  bus?  That's &quot;Pin-Hand brake lever from Chassis No. 20-041.712&quot;
&gt;&gt;  for those who don't have the part numbers memorized.

&gt; Stupid queston. Is it pressed on? If it is, hammering, twisting
&gt; with vise grips won't do it. You would need a drift.

Far as I know it is not pressed into place.  Bentley manual just
says &quot;remove&quot; as though it should slide in/out with ease.

&gt; Another stupid queston. How do you get stripped hinge screws out
&gt; for the front doors on a split? They are torqued-in, so
&gt; easy-outs won't do it.

What part is stripped?  The head or the threads?  I have used an
impact wrench and a hammer to remove &quot;lots&quot; of the door screws
with little problem.  If the head is shot, I would drill out the
head to removed the door.  Might be enough of the screw sticking
out after the hinge is gone to put vice grips on the rest for
removal.  All indications are that impact wrench is your best
bet.
