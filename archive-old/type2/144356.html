&gt;  is it ok to use a beetle style muffler on a 70 bus?

&gt; Sure, if you want to risk dying from carbon monoxide poisoning.

&gt; And George replied:

&gt;  OTOH, thousands of folks have used beetle mufflers with no apparent
&gt; mortality.  I used to run one with an &quot;iffy&quot; rear hatch seal and my CO
&gt; detector card didn't detect any excess CO.

&gt; I did not say you would die. I said &quot;if you want to risk dying&quot;.

&gt; And not everyone dies from have 1100 lb tires on their Westy either.

&gt; Some people get lucky.....

&gt; If you mis-read what I wrote as implying that you will die from using a bug muffler, then you need to re-read
&gt; what I wrote. It seems like every time I reply to a post, uncomprehension rears it's ugly head. This is the
&gt; last list post I am replying to, to the list. I am tired of this.

I did not mis-read what you wrote, nor imply that you said something you
didn't.  I merely made a statement and shared some information.  You said
that there was a risk, and I said that experience has shown that the
risk was negligible.

You are a valued member of the list and I hate to see you go.  However, in
the present situation I think you are being a bit oversensitive.
