&lt;&lt;  I just got back from a 30 minute drive 
in middle of the night Utah winter weather; it took close to 20 just to 
defog the windows completely. When I got out to the vehicle, there was frost 
not only on the outside, but the /inside/ of the windshield, which I have 
never seen before in my life.  &gt;&gt;

Don't know what your local equivalent would be, but check out a computer
repair/salvage joint for 12V dc &quot;muffin&quot; fans. I've got a pair of 'em nicely
(but not necessary) mounted to the top of my dash. Mine are 6 inch dia-
meter and really help defrost/demist the top of my winshield. I'm not 
that tall -6'1&quot;- but I'm sure others suffer the same discomfort of try-
ing to view through the lower half of the windshield. The fans won't add
any heat to your system but even a little heat with the increased air-
flow should help speed up the defrosting...
