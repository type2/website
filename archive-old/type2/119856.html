Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Evaporation line

I found these pictures (http://www.benplace_dot_com/weber.htm) helpful when
I routed my crankcase breather hose to my weber progressive. I found
there was already an opening in the bottom side of the air cleaner that
fit the 14mm (I think) hose. Although no picture shows the mounting
without the air cleaner installed, you might find this helpful as well.

Perhaps there are others out there running the 2BBL Progressive carbs
that can post a picture of how they have their crank breather line attached?
