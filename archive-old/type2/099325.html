Subject: Piston Balance material removal.

Hi All:

I have a set of  Mahle type IV engine pistons that need to be balanced,
the weights range from 530.42 gms to 537.20 gms. I have three sets of
pins, but the most weight savings I can get by matching pins is 1 gm.
That still leaves 6 grams to take off the heaviest piston. Unlike the
type I pistons, these do not have the center boss that can be filed. Any
suggestions as to where I can remove material without weakening the
pistons.

Muir suggest the skirts, other sources I have seen hit any boss or even
underneath the pin bores (between pin bore and top of piston). I can
tell that the Mahle skirts have been radial cut for some balance, but to
remove 6 grams would require cutting into the tops of the pin bores
(about 4 mm's ).

I have heard suggested that I have the pins reamed out to make up the
weight. But I have also heard that these are very hard and hence
difficult to cut.

Regards,
