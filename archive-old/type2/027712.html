Hello,

     Just my $.02 on bondo.  I used actual Bondo over brazed metal patches 
on my bus rocker panels.  Some of it was pretty thick, over 1/4 inch in some 
spots.  It began to bubble 8 years later after the metal under it had rusted 
away to a rusty stain on the inside of the bondo. (There was still rust 
inside the rockers).  I also drove around for about a year with just primer 
over it, before finally painting it.  In places where I properly removed all 
the rust and painted right away, it is still there.  I find the big 
advantage of better fillers like Metal-2-Metal is that they spread better, 
stay where you put them and sand down smooth.  Bondo tends to be runny,slide 
off and trap air in it, but seems to last a long time.  I use Metal-2-metal 
now and keep it under 1/4 of an inch. Just my opinion.

-James.
