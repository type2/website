&gt; Shawn, Mike:
&gt; Try to find one the same BRAND manufacturer. I think there may have been 4 or
&gt; possibly 5 total brands:
&gt; Mahle and Kolbenschmidt would have been original.
&gt; NPR, Cofap,and possibly a Taiwanese no-name are aftermarket.
&gt; Because of differences in the steel strut design, they can weigh a lot
&gt; different.

tell me about it, the type IV rebuild I foolishly threw my money away for
from GEX had three different brands of pistons in one engine (advertised
&quot;new set&quot; of pistons and cyl....which is how I beat em in court.

had two VW's (hadn't been made in over 10 years or so)
and one each  cofap and mahle.

when I did it over &quot;right&quot; I got a matched set of Mahle's still in the
original box... they weighed in at for all intents the same.   built the
engine balanced at less than 1gram total with all pistons,cyl, rod's etc,
assembled, all except a flywheel, but I have an automatic so it doesn't
have a flywheel, so that was not a problem...amazing how much smoother the
engine will run.
