Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Tank Shipping

&gt; To help complete my fuel injection transplant, I have been kindly
&gt; offered a 1979 petrol tank. Knowing that someone out there has
&gt; shipped such an item, what is the best way to go about this? Thanks.


If you can get it within the size limits (it's very close!), send it
Priority Mail rather than UPS. They tend to be much more gentle on
&quot;dentable&quot; objects like gas tanks.  We were shipping all of our Vanagon gas
tanks Priority Mail for that reason, until the post office caught on to the
fact that they were 6 inches over the size limit. :-(
