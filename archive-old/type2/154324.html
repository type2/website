Subject: Re: [T2] Rim Color

Do NOT get the inserts - they are not safe on radial tires. They rub on the
sidewalls. I have a few tires where the lettering has been completely rubbed
off and I have heard of cases where they have worn the sidewalls down to the
steel belts. Supposedly, these inserts are safe on bias ply tires.

If it is a bus, the only safe thing you can do is have white walls
vulcanized on proper bus tires or use tire paint. There are no re-inforced
white walls out there.

Get those inserts if you want whitewalls. That way you can have whatever
tire you want without being limited to what comes in whitewalls.
