Subject: offset antenna wanted (splittie bus)

A private conversation between  &quot;Tim McKane&quot; &lt;tmckane_at_magg_dot_net&gt; and I rolled
around to the offset antenna as seen on pg.65 of the January '97 VW Trends
magazine. We agree that they have the &quot;neat&quot; factor. My antenna is in place
but Tim is seeking definitive source information can anyone provide help? I
have suggested a guess that maybe the typical catelogs would be the thing.
Evidentally swap meets are rare in his neck of the woods.
