Subject: Heat Exchanger Broke

Volks,

I got the bus back together and it runs great with the new clutch. Although 
after taking it out for a test drive tonight I ran into a problem. The 
passenger side heat exchanger broke off at the front (FIF) where it meets 
the exhaust tubes coming out of the engine. I don't have a stock muffler as 
the PO modified the bumper and put a dual exhaust setup on it. Can I just 
take the heat exchangers off and replace them with muffler pipe? Will this 
effect my engines performance? If I do one I will do the other too, 
otherwise it will make the engine unbalanced. I don't need the heat cause I 
only drive the bus in the summer anyways.
I have been trying to get the bus back together cause I am leaving for a 
trip on tuesday and need to make sure everything is fine.
Thanks,

Jeff Mckenna
