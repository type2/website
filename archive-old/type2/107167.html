&gt; &gt; &gt;Buses?  They don't really need wide tires at all.  If &gt;they make you feel
&gt; &gt; &gt;good, go right ahead, but the &gt;Porsche folks at the autocross won't have
&gt; &gt; &gt;anything to &gt;fear!

&gt; &gt; Neither do the Turbo Bug drag racers, George? ;)

&gt; I dunno, did you smoke your tires?  :)

This is a bit cryptic without an explanation, and I didn't realize that it
was going to the list...

Mike had the honor of besting a lot of very hot bugs in the bracket racing
at a recent VW drag event, driving his early Bay camper.
