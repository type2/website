Subject: re: [T2] 76 top on 71

Hi,

71 camper, or 71 Bus?

The pop-top won't fit the camper properly, as the hinges are wrong. 
swapping to the later hinges is fairly easy; but it's tricky to get the 
roof and luggage rack aligned because the mounting points for the late 
luggage rack are not visible with the rack in place. The same issues 
apply to installing the pop-top on a bus, except that if you want the 
upper double-bed you have to do a LOT of cutting and welding. It took 
about 100 hours of work to do my conversion, including body-prep for 
the repaint.

I put a 74-79 pop-top onto a 79 bus 2 years ago. You can see the 
process and results here:
