&gt; Ahhhhhhh!  Then you've never driven a turboed 68 bug!
&gt;
&gt;
   No, but back when I was immortal I knew someone who
stuffed a Corvair engine in the back of one...(Back when
both cars were current... ;-(
It was, shall we say, interesting...Very fast in a straight
line but scary-squirrely when trying (operative word...;-)
to turn...

Nicest car I've ever driven: 289 Cobra...
Nicest car I've ever riden in: 427 Cobra...
Both owned by the guy I bought my Bugeye from...
The guy was an mechanical engineer and enough of
a car nut to street the 289, but race the 427...BTW,
he also had a racing Turner and drove to work every
day in a Messerschmitt...Watta character... ;-)
