Subject: Re: [T2] woodworking bus/westy owners...

Cool - time to start making the rounds..

Usually my result is I express some interest and that particular person 
decides that if I want it - it must be worth something and suddenly there 
is a price...

Has happened with car parts and wood and lot's of things.

&gt;&lt;&lt; Hey Tony - what do they charge you for these doors?
&gt;
&gt;Is this a big franchise or a Mom and Pop operation?
&gt;
&gt;I like this source!!!
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Nothing...Deal is, whenever they get a pallet full of &quot;cut-outs&quot; or
&gt;culls, they give me a ring. Not a franchise, but a fairly large local
&gt;company. The cut-outs are from installing lights (windows, to the
&gt;non woodworking), in the doors...Average size, about 18-24 wide
&gt;and about 60 inches long. I've used them to build a &quot;coffered&quot;
&gt;ceiling in my front hall (final total about 300 separate pieces),
&gt;including strips of oak flooring run through my table saw and edged
&gt;on my table router- Roman ogee, natch (see my email address ;-).
