Subject: Re: [T2] Air Conditioning, to keep, or not to keep?

&gt; But everything attached to the motor is gone.
&gt;

Maybe not everything... What about the pulley forward (front is front)
of the cooling fan? Mounting brackets on the fan shroud?

&gt; I was thinking of removing everything else except keep
&gt; the blowers under the dash to move air around in the
&gt; bus. What is your thoughts?
&gt;

I think it may be worth it to have that air a bit cooler. Especially
if you curtain in the front cabin to keep the cooling air on the front
seats.

&gt; I figured getting this system back into shape would be
&gt; quite costly, Having to find compressor, brackets
&gt; pully, and replacing lines? I don't have air in my
&gt; other 2 bus's, so why should I have it in this one.
&gt;

Again, check for those bits. You might be surprised. A compressor
isn't terribly expensive from Bus Depot and it's reportedly an order
of magnitude more efficient.

Why should you care? Cooler driving, jealous bus owners.

&gt; Also does anyone have a manual on this air
&gt; conditioning unit? Also a wiring diagram? I want to be
&gt; able to see how to remove and or repair this unit, and
&gt; also be able to track down the extra wiring for this.
&gt;

I've seen 'em floating around the net. Someone here will probably be
able to point you in the right direction...

I have a kit pulled from a 79 that's still setting here gathering
dust. With the overhead vents. I was going to put it in the GWB, but
when I got rid of that and bought the Guac, I've been agonizing over
whether to cut the necessary holes in the Guac for the AC.
