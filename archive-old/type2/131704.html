Subject: RE: [T2]oil filler cap seal

&gt;From: ChaMoon


&gt;can someone tell me what size the seal is that goes inside the tube for the 
&gt;oil filler cap .

&gt;i am talking about when you take pliars to the metal clamp and pull the 
&gt;whole thing off the plastic part up inside the black plastic there is 
&gt;suppose to be a seal that goes there?

&gt;i found that the large size pushrod tube seal will fit it but is to fat and 
&gt;want let the oil filler cap go all the way down correctly on the metal 
&gt;sooooooo what can i use here&gt;?
&gt;its causing oil to sling out everywhere and i even tried sealent but that 
&gt;doesnt hold but a day course thats without any kind of seal at all and just 
&gt;sealent.

&gt;its a small ring looks just like a pushrod seal but thinner.
&gt;peace and love


Whoah there is a seal in there? I never noticed. Are you talking about the 
filler neck where the plastic meets the metal? Or where the plastic cap 
meets the filler neck.

I am confused.

Do you see it here? If it is the cap gasket(A) you can cut one out of stock 
cork.
