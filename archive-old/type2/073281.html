Subject: Re: 71 Dorm - Top Removal

Ian Baker,
	I have no first hand experience with doing this but know someone
who has done this to get the bus into a garage. First let air out of the
tires to see if that will lower it enuf to get the bus inside (I hear this
is what the big semis do when they get stuck under a bridge or other
obstruction.) Next find like say four of those donut &quot;courtesy&quot; tires that
all cars come with these days. You know the ones that say not to go over 60
MPH and some idiot passes you with one of these on at about 80. Anyway I am
getting off track here, drill holes in the rims to match the stud pattern
on the bus. hope that this helps.
