&gt;   In my campground this morning I saw a camper called a Rialto, and it had a VW emblem on it...

I know that Winnebago started constructing a form of mini-motorhome quite some time ago (Rialto may have been the name then too).  They used Renault front-wheel drivetrain and 4-cyl Diesel engine combo.  Too low for me (6' 2&quot;) and too pokey.  I believe they switched to the new VW Eurovan drivetrain (originally 4-cyl gasoline, maybe VR6 now) when it was made available in the US.  (Still too low and pokey for me.) No idea about current/used $$ - see your closest RV dealer or look up Winnebago on the Net.  You can see a variant of this almost every week on the TV show &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; (USA Network).  It's the van they use to transport their anti-terrorist agents to a conflict site.
