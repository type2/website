Subject: Re: [T2] Electric Fuel Pump, YES or NO?

The particular one that I use (the purolator) does not allow anything to
get by when it's turned off. 

Todd

&gt;Just remember the stock fuel pump limits free flow of fuel from the tank
to
&gt;the carby, but most electric pumps don't. This can lead to the fuel tank
&gt;slowly draining through the carby, especially if the bus is parked nose
up.
&gt;Just something to be aware of.
&gt;This situation is worse on type 4 motors and type 1 also.
