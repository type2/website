Subject: Re: [T2] Is it worth it?(Ramble)

KG,
ahhh, this could be argued upon forever, but really it
is up to you.   Having had my bus for a mere 2 years
now, and really my first introduction to Vdubs, i can
say it has been many times a royal PITA, i do know
almost every triple A guy in the area and i am
currently in need of an engine rebuild as we
speak(hope to drop the motor this weekend)   This may
all sound horrible, but all i have to do is peak my
head out my window and catch a glimpse of it, and
suddenly its all worthwhile.   theres nothing like the
feeling it gives you when youre behind the wheel,
tieing up traffic, getting into conversations with
strangers everywhere you go, tons of stuff like that. 
 plus at the end of a day of driving i can pull over
and go to bed, snug as bug in a rug.   these buses may
need a little more TLC than your average Toyota camry,
but they are simple in design, and the more you learn,
the easier they are to work on.   my bus has taken me
on 2 cross country trips, and to numerous shows all
for a lot less than a $300 car payment.   she might
keep my wallet light, but at least its sporadic.  
This of course is based on the premise that i do 90%
of the work myself, might be different if i couldnt
work on it myself$  oh well, just my $.02, since youre
asking, im sure deep down you know it too, they are
worth it:)......that is of course until im elbow deep
in grease, sweating profusely...and i just cant get
that last nut loose.....damn thing!!!
happy friday!

&gt; Let me start by saying I have owned an loved VW's
&gt; for the 15 years I have 
&gt; been driving.  A few years ago I paid $2000 for a
&gt; 1973 Camper in fair 
&gt; condition, drove it about 400 miles, towed it about
&gt; 200 miles, and spent 
&gt; about $500 more before letting the city tow it away.
&gt;  As I look through the 
&gt; classifieds I see buses that trade hands every year,
&gt; even ads for the early 
&gt; 90's vanagons often say something like &quot;100,000
&gt; miles, but only 30,000 on 
&gt; new engine&quot;.  Is there something inherently wrong
&gt; with these things?  Why do 
&gt; I want another?  If I buy one will I have to put a
&gt; new engine in every year 
&gt; and stop every 200 miles for n &quot;adjustment&quot;?
