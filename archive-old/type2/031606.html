&gt; was fine for the first 60 miles, then I heard a loud noise. Sounded like I

&gt; the dash and saw the generator light come on, so I stopped. Walked around 
&gt; back, opened the engine lid, and guess what I see? The alternator (yes, alt. 
&gt; not gen.) pulley has come off and is ripped into a couple of big pieces. 
&gt; Pieces must have shot all over because one cracked my distributor cap and one 
&gt; shot out the left side of the bus making a nice hole in the body. Ouch! Belt 
&gt; was still there and intact, as was inner pulley.

whooeee!  lucky no one was hurt.

doubt if it did any physical damage to the engine, unless a piece impacted
someplace.

get a WHOLE new pully assembly, the other piece that didn't break is
probably suspect.. replace the belt and distributor cap.. make sure the
new pulley is properly adjusted and torqued and be carefull around the
engine until it breaks in , check adjustment and torque frequently at
first if it appears to be comeing loose find out why.

sorry no one stopped, must not be on the AIRS list, but then I will stop
for most any ACVW and don't check their AIRS membership card (what card?)
