Subject: oil oil, I still care!!
Message-ID: &lt;0.144bb6ae.2556403a_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I think I will be ordering some gaskets tomorrow and Monday but is it 
foolish?  I will replace the; oil ring oil breather to case gasket,  oil 
filer pipe to case, gasket,  oil cooler seals, oil pump to case gasket, valve 
cover gaskets, am i missing any and can all of these be replaced easily with 
the motor still installed? and if all gaskets are replaced what's left.  i 
think the pushrod seals are still good, and can pretty much say this is a 
pressure problem at the rate the oil fills every possible nook and cranny.
Peace Out
