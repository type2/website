Subject: Turbo Bus

I've been away from the list for a while, and my bus has been parked for 
months.  My two little girls (1 and 3) have required pretty much all of 
my free time for a while but in my head, while doing the chores, etc. 
I've been plotting a grand reawakening for my poor, neglected bus.  Last 
Thursday the biggest piece of the puzzle fell into place - I towed home 
an 84 Passat turbodiesel.  The car is a basket case but the motor is 
good and will bolt right up with the Vanagon diesel parts I've been 
collecting.  It will take me a while to complete this project.  Months 
probably, maybe even a year but it WILL be done.  If anyone needs parts 
from an '84 Passat, please let me know.  I will also have a complete 
well-worn 2-liter engine for sale plus a rebuildable 2-liter short block.
