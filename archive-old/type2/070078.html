Advert in Saturday's Sacramento, CA paper, parting out section:

VW'S '72, 1 Bus, 1 Camper, mags, extra engine, $350/all  916-635-8445

For complete vehicles, if you really want more info, there are 5
loafs (3 Westis) and 13 (6 Westis) Vanagons also for sale, 
private e-mail if you are interested, I'll provide phone #'s.
That's all I know, just copied the ad, call them not me, you know the 
drill.
