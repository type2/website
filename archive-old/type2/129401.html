Subject: 84 Westy speaker wiring?

Our 84 Westy has a two pair of mighty 4'' speakers -- one pair  mounted 
in the front doors, and a second pair mounted in the cabinet above the 
rear seat. The radio is a strikingly unattractive Crown model with brown 
front panel and red lettering. This is the most basic car radio I've 
ever seen -- even my dad's Hillman Husky had a 5-button model that was 
capable of memorizing station locations. AM only, of course.

Anyway, I'm contemplating popping in a basic CD player/AM/FM radio in 
place of this fine example of late 1970's designing. Does anyone have a 
wiring diagram for the speakers?
