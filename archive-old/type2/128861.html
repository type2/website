Subject: Re: [T2] Double Relay to fuel Pump

Hi Michael,

Double-relay issues are not fun... I went through this getting the FI 
running on the westfakia.  They can be sorted out though.

The following info helps a LOT:

Here are the pin-outs for the double relay:

85 -  Ground
86 -  Thermal time switch
86a - Starter
86b - AFM Vane Switch wire #36
86c - Ignition switch (+ coil power)
88a - AFM Vane switch wire #39
88b - Resistor Pack
88c - Aux Air regulator
88d - Fuel Pump
88y - Battery
88z - Battery

88y and 88z are powered from the same wire to the battery with a jumper 
at the connector block.

Check for power at 88Y and 88Z. If you don't have power there, follow 
the wire back to the starter. My guess would be that it doesn't get 
there, or if it does then there isn't a connection between the battery 
and the starter. But... Voltage won't flow if it has nowhere to go. Are 
you 100% certain the ground strap is clean and tight?

Next, use a jumper to put 12V to terminal 88D. If you don't hear the 
pump running at this point, you have a bad wire to the pump or a bad 
pump.

Happy trails,

&gt; I checked the fuse and there was not one in there. I popped one in and

&gt;
&gt; Karl mentioned something about a fuse holder and three wires going 
&gt; into it(77 Westy Deluxe). One wire to the double relay one to the coil 
&gt; and one going to the backup light switch on the tranny. Now mine is 
&gt; definately different. One wire goes to the auxilary battery the other 
&gt; to the relay. I do have the black wire in the pic that goes to the 
&gt; coil straight from the relay.
