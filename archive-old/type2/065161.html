Subject: Re: type4 valve adjustment and timing

&gt;Hello
&gt;I have a 74 bus with a 1800cc carburated engine. I would like to
&gt;set the valves but the pulley does not have any marks on it.
&gt;I removed the inpection plug but could not get my head in there
&gt;to see anything. Where are the marks supposed to be on a type4?
 Also, which valve is intake and which is exaust.
&gt;I am really tired so please excuse my rambling question style.
&gt;Thanks

 You have one of those &quot;make ya crazy&quot; set-ups.

 The Fan Pulley should have a timing mark on the rear (fif) of the 
fan/pulley combo hanging out the back there.

 Right above it tucked under the fan shroud a bit is a Quarter circle
of sheet metal or plastic with timing marks on it.

 If you see 2 threaded bosses off the casting there then yours is missing.

 These were readily available for about a buck at my flaps.

 The TDC marker is a hole in the flywheel housing toward the engine 
and on the right hand side just above the left mounting bolt.

 In the flywheel there are 2 pins screwed into the flywheel and are 
to be read by a sensor on the dealers computer.

 I can only assume that TDC is exactly between the two but I have nothing to
quote from.

 So here's what I did on the '73 which had nothing.:

 Pull all the plugs and get an assistant, you can't do this very well 
by yourself.

 Get lined up on the #1 with the dizzy and verify with the lifters.

 Get in there with a wire with a bend in the end that will get thru the plug
hole. 
 Meanwhile your assistant is down there with a socket on the end of the fan
pulley/end of crank.

 They crank it up to top while you feel in there sideways with your 
wire. 

 The plugs come in sideways on those heads.

 When you find your spot you mark the fan lip there where it can be compared
to that timing marks piece. Get a file on it so it will stay.

 On the .006-.008: I don't see much reason to question it.
The exhausts are much hotter I think and may very well need the extra
.002&quot;. 

 The exhausts are the outside valves of each head. It's apparent, as I
recall, when you look at the manifold while you're down there.

 There's a concensus that if those puppies didn't come with hydraulic
lifters, it is worth-while to install.

 This TDC thing sounds like the reason tho.       west
