Subject: Re: [T2] Re: ADMIN: Re: [T2] VDO Gauges for Sale

Hey Todd, keep your head up...alot of us have been slapped around by ADMIN.
Keep living freely...but when in Type 2 land just do it more cautiosly...or
pad your back side in prep for a spanking.
MOST IMPORTANTLY keep lovin' and sharin' and bouncin' down the road in your
BUS (got the bus content in)!
Todd, some of us around here just wear a grin all the time and some have
forgotten how to...my advise...keep grinnin'...:-)
Duane

&gt; Ouch. Yeah, sorry about the eBay post, I didn't know it wasn't allowed
&gt; (obviously, it shows I didn't read the charter).

&gt; &gt; &quot;Do not try to promote your eBay auctions or other auctions on the
&gt; &gt; list. We filter heavily for this. If we want to know what is for
&gt; &gt; sale on eBay we will go there and look.&quot;
