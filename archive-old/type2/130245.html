Boy, I can identify with that. I'd rather work on my SC or any of my
previously owned bays and bugs than my old 83 wasser boxer! That first
year water cooled 1900 was a nightmare, both engine and body. After my
first rebuild (Yes, I drove it enough for two rebuilds) I had learned a
lot of things about the engine and how unique it was, not only from the
aircooled, but also from following years where major changes occurred.
My Bentleys has more red letter notes in it for that Van than any other
I have owned. The body had major one year only problems too which I
solved by changings parts from following years. I did like the fact that
my GL had a very large cargo area where I could close the lid on twenty
sheets of plywood, or refridgerators or washers and dryers. Sniff, I
miss it and all the fun camping we did in it with the side tent. It's
too bad that the radiator is so close to the bumper of the truck ahead
of you! As a warning, the crinkle zones are mid drivers seat, center
cargo area, center of the engine support area. Great drive, poor design.

  Keeping a now somewhat older vanagon
running is quite a challenge for any owner who does their own mechanical

work.  It is really a straight forward job to keep a split window bus
running if you can find the parts!!!!   Gary Gibson
