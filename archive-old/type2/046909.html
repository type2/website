Subject: [T2] Cleaning up a Shappire

The Sapphire XIV in my bus has a slide switch above the preset buttons that
toggles you between AM and FM.  It's gotten dirty, I guess, and vibration
and bad looks will provoke it to wander between the two, leaving much static
in it's wake.  Also, when it's in radio Twilight Zone, the volume drops
dramatically, but not entirely.  Makes it exciting when it vibrates back to
one band or the other.

What's the best stuff to clean things up?  Acetone?  Is that vinyl friendly?
Sources?

C'mon, sparkies, I need the news.  Thanks.
