Subject: Re: [T2] conditioning balljoint boots

Richard,

IIRC, glycerine, glycerine, glycerine....I have seen several references
in some of the old owners manuals and a few other places.

I bought some last week at the local Wal-mart...you may have to ask the
pharamcist for it though as sometimes they don't leave it &quot;out&quot;.

The pharmacist will have it because they frequently use it to mix 
medicines.

No, I have not used it yet, so I don't know how it is going to work....

Cheers, dave

&gt; It seems that balljoints last forever, well until the boot cracks. What's the best chemical to use to preserve the rubber?
