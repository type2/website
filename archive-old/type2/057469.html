&gt; Maybe I'm paraphrasing St. Bob here, but I don't see the point of an

    Your exhaust headers must be a whole lot different than mine -- mine
are exactly the same, both sides.

&gt; Tell me what a muffler has to do with emissions in anything more than a trivial sense.  Does it soak up all of the foul air coming from the internal

    A great many VW exhaust include catalytic concerter, egr, etc.

&gt; Not much of an EarthFirster, are ya?  You drive an old, polluting vehicle
&gt; that gets 18-21mpg everyday to work.  They do make cars that pollute a
&gt; HELLUVA lot less, you know.  For example.  Go buy yourself a Rabbit Diesel.

     Recycling an older vehicle is preferable to buying a new machine,
with all the attendant pollution involved in creating that new vehicle,
waste of resources, etc. Plus it's a camper. In fact, I never intended
it to be a daily driver -- when I lived in WI, I rode my bike just about
everywhere, winter and summer, only used the bus when I needed to carry
big stuff. But Mobile -- well, you'd be stupid to try to ride a bike
around Mobile much. Believe me, I've tried. There are no bike lanes
anywhere. Most people are very hostile to bike riders, blowing their
horn at you, giving you the finger, etc. They also drive faster than
anywhere I've ever been before. And I see more accidents and have more
close calls than I've ever experienced anywhere -- riding a bike is
pretty scary. Bums me out, because I assumed I'd be able to ride to work
-- I've tried it a few times, but it's not worth the risk. It's a nice 1
hour bike ride to work. Instead, I spend an hour a day in the car, then
ride an hour on a back road after work for exercise. Even there I get
people blowing their horns at me. And I almost never see anyone else on
a bike, except right around the University. Nor is there any real public
transportation -- a few token buses, but far and few between. And since
vehicle insurance isn't required, and there are one heck of a lot of
poor people driving $15 cars -- if you get hit on a bike, you're
probably SOL even if you survive.

&gt; 
&gt; Or you could just buy an electric car!  Generate the power via solar panels

    Well, at this point it's more like you could build an electric car.
And yes that's something I'd really like to do -- OTOH, I'd still want
to keep a Westy around. 
 
&gt; Sounds like you need to take another look at your degree of &quot;radical&quot;
&gt; thinking.  As far as I'm concerned, you're just like every one of those
&gt; rednecks I know that drives their '74 Nova 350 from their trailer out in
&gt; the county into work at the factory every day.

    Gee -- pretty hostile, aren't you?

&gt; 
&gt; A Radical EarthFirster?  Poseur.

    I think my environmentalist activities and credentials are pretty
well known in those circles. In fact got me on the front page of every
newspaper in the US back when I was a bit younger and rowdier. And, in
fact, was involved in radical environmental action long before
EarthFirst got started by Dave Foreman, et al. 
    So what are you doing to help your Mother?
