&quot;I was driving the Bus to the VWoA headqueaters and all at once I began
to loose power and there was an excessive amount of blow by.  Everyone
kept saying that I had to have thrown a rod - I know what that sounds
like - my engine still sounds perfect - no helicopter rattle - no
cicadas - nothing....&quot;

With no untoward noises, it sounds like severely seized rings and/or a
burned piston. What were the symptoms indicating &quot;blow-by&quot;?

&quot;...It had all new spark plugs, distributor
cap, and oil filter but in just the day before everything went wrong -
timing couldn't cause this, could it, the firing order was off for about
30 minutes - we couldn't find the notch in the distributor for awhile
and the pistons were firing in the wrong order.&quot;

Unfortunately, timing certainly could cause exaclty these symptoms. Too far
advanced and driven under normal conditions it's relatively easy to burn a
hole in a piston.

At any rate, it's easy to isolate the problem. You'll need to do a leak-down
test. Figure out a way to inject air into the cylinder, making sure both
valves are closed (point the ignition rotor at that cylinder). You can use a
piece of small hose, anything just do it seals into the plug hole. You can
have a friend blow into the hose while you listen for air escaping. Take off
the air cleaner assembly, open the throttle and listen at the air intake
opening. Listen at the tail pipe. Take off the oil fill cap and listen for
air coming from the crankcase.

Results: Air out the exhaust or intake means valve leakage, out the
crankcase means rings or piston.

You're gonna be taking it apart regardless, I'm afraid, so gird your loins
and pick up some Go-Jo...
