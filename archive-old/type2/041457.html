Subject: Re: very poor FI gas mileage????

Recently my gas mileage has started slipping, was getting about 16 or so
around town, 19 on the road, lately it has dropped to around 10 around
town and 14 or so on the road..???  weird thing is it runs and starts the
same as it always has, can't find anything out of wack

78 fuel injected, pretty much stock
has Pertronix on vacuum dizzy
oil temp and presure haven't changed from normal
plugs are clean and grey, not burned

this one has really got me stumped, and with the price of gas, well ;8*{

any ideas????

thanks
Bob
