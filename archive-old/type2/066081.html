Subject: Re: Juddering clutch in 1982 Bus

I have an '82 (recently purchased ) with a 4 speed. I have also owned 2 other transporters with 
standard transmissions. I have a similar problem (possibly the same one) on the '82 which I 
know to be the motor mounts. Replacement of these is on my list of things to do. What I 
experience is a clunking noise when I let out the clutch too fast. When I let out the clutch 
too fast the engine shifts and hits things like the oil filler tube (which passes just above 
the support crossbar that the 4 engine mounts are bolted to). I have a host of other noises 
which I haven;t identified as of yet.  Anyway, I don't have a problem if I let the clutch out 
smoothly and don't gass it too much. If your clutch is grabbing when you let it out, you may 
simply need to replace or adjust the clutch. I haven't had any real clutch problems on my VWs. 
In either case you may want to inspect the motor mounts for cracked or torn rubber.

1982 Bus (Vanagon), 2.0l air-cooled, 4 speed, 125k miles:
When you bring up the clutch the whole vehicle shudders. This happens 1st
and reverse, but also in 2nd. In fact it is easier to reproduce it in 2nd.
When there are enough revs and take up is slow its OK but when you are
trying for a quick getaway in 1st or 2nd its more noticeable.

How do you diagnose whether its a bad clutch or just what happens normally
because of the engine mountings?
