Subject: Re: [T2] Cooling a Type 1 (1641cc) Engine in a '73 Westy

Install the OEM tin (make sure EVERYTHING is in good shape including any rubber seals) and then use sheet metal to create additional tin that needs to be in place to allow the new tin to seal to the engine bay seal. 

This is the part of my Corvair implant project that I'm working on. I cut my tin to fit the engine bay opening so I didn't have to alter the bus, welding in a bit of new steel to fill the voids and plan to use a stock Type IV foam gasket/seal to tie the body and engine tin together. I've learned alot about metal work in the process! &lt;grin!&gt; 

You could use pop-rivets and possibly even the body repair epoxies though I do not know their upper temp limits. I've used alot of card board to cut and test fit the pieces before I made steel pieces to MIG weld in permanently. 

Tools I've used (and you may not need): Tin snips will cut the steel okay, 5&quot; angle grinder with grinding wheels, wire wheels and cutoff wheels, MIG welder (I recommend a true gas welder and not the solid core welder like mine), scissors, card stock, Sharpie markers, pop-rivet gun, drills and bits, and a good helping of patience.

Good luck.
