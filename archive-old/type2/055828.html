&gt;All,
&gt;Diesel fuel is not for gas engines, though...

We had a customer fill is diesel car with petrol to about 50/50 mix of the
two fuels, as my mate and I were the only people running non injected petrol
engines we split this mix and watered it down to about 75% petrol and 25%
diesel. His metro run like a dream except for a bit of smoke in the
mornings, my bus ended up having a complete fuel system clean but it ran
much much better than before.
