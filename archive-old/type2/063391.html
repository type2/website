Subject: 1962 Westy Hatch Sunroof

     
     I'm new to the newsgroup.  I own an unrestored 1962 Westfalia camper. 
     My father in law purchased the car new in Germany in 62.  
     
     The hatch sunroof has failed.  The hinge seals leaked and rotted the 
     hinge bolts.  I've just started ordering catalogs and thought I'd ping 
     the newsgroup to try to get a quick pointer to anyone that still makes 
     hatch sunroof parts.  Does anyone still make or have parts for the 
     1962 hatch sunroof?
