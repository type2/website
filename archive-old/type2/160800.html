Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild or replace? 1.8L FI engine from 75 Auto westy

Woulda had this out sooner but I spilled coffee on my keyboard.

&gt; Sooo.... One simple and OBVIOUS detail was missed? I wonder what other 
&gt; not so obvious details were also missed? Little things like degreeing 
&gt; the cam maybe? Getting the valve train geometry right? Installing the 
&gt; pistons right side up?
&gt; Sorry, but if the obvious stuff is missed, I get nervous about the 
&gt; hidden stuff. That goes for any product, not just VW engines. If I go 
&gt; to purchase a washing machine and the door is crooked, do I figure 
&gt; &quot;Well, no biggie. It's just the door...&quot; or do I say, &quot;No WAY I'm 
&gt; buying that thing!&quot;

It made me a little leery at the time, but at that point I wasn't in 
much of a position to do a teardown &amp; inspection.  Most of my tools 
were still in storage back in California, the Other Car had a blown 
headgasket &amp; warped head, and I'd had to rent a U-haul just to get the 
engine home from the FedEx terminal.  So I tweeked the exhaust studs 
straight, dressed the engine, stabbed it into the engine compartment 
and crossed my fingers.  Didn't quite trust it for months.

When the engine in the Bus spun a rod bearing, we'd been staying at my 
parents summer cabin in the mountains.  In the winter.  With a sloping 
dirt driveway and no garage.  If I'd had space and tools available to 
me, I'd have rebuilt the engine myself
  .. but with things the way they were, I opted for the longblock.

The AVP engine's been good to me.  I've had zero -- zilch -- nada 
problems with the engine in 30,000 miles.  I drive the Westy daily, and 
while I don't *abuse* it, I don't baby it either.  Compression is in 
the 120-125 range across all four cylinders, the valve adjustments stay 
put, and it only uses/loses about a pint of oil between my erratic 
&quot;It's about time to change the oil&quot; changes, which are typically around 
3-3500 miles.

I'm happy, with this specific AVP engine.  Other people with other 
engines may have  different story.
