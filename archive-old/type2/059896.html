Subject: Re: jet sizes, plug for brazilian solex

 Well I'm here to tell you that given the alternative (a
&gt;crappy running, worn out German Solex) spend the $130 and get a new
&gt;Brazilian (or is it Mexican?) Solex. You will be happy you did.

The one I just bought for my '74 Karmann Ghia is Mexican.  I'll let you 
all know how it works out when I get a chance to install it.  I need to 
do that so the Ghia will be halfway driveable...also gotta change the 
oil on the Benz -- 8 quarts!
