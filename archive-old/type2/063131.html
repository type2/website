Subject:Computer for sale...in need of 2nd VW Van

hey now,

i've found a nice vw '76 westy that is only $1600. only problem is i don't
have $1600. i don't use my computer much anymore...so, i'm going to sell
it. it's an IBM, 66mhz, 425mb hardfile, 8 megs and has 3.5 floppy drive,
cd drive, speakers, and many games such as doom, etc on it. lots of software.
compared to today's computers it ain't much but it's great for a first computer
or for word processing. the only thing that doesn't work is the modem and if
you are seriously interested in the computer, i will have that fixed. i'm
asking $1000 for it but of course will negotiate a bit. comes with a monitor.
if you are interesed please drop me an email or give me page at 919-507-8220.
