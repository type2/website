Subject: Are stupid questions allowed?  &lt;g&gt;

Gonna have some down time waiting for a compressor to do more leak testing
with, so I
got to thinking about how much I cringe when the van sits for several
months, sometimes up to four, and I have to start it up, and listen to the
hammers of hell, for usually 20+ minutes, sometimes longer until I take it
on the freeway and run it good. In the spring, when hibernation ends, its
very stressful

This is not about the noisy lifters, exactly. Been through the MMO, and all
the filter, oil weights, followed all the discussions, and have been living
with it for years. Not a problem when I drive it regularly.

Anyway, on to the dumb question...

I read here, or on another forum, from someone who stated that with the oil
at the full mark, and on level ground, the lifters are -almost- completely
submerged in oil. I have never been close up to the engine innards to know
if that is true, or not, so first of all, is that a fair statement?

The really crazy part would be, if the engine was overfilled, by a half, or
even a full quart, does that submerge the lifters completely, and could that
be a help in preventing them from 'leaking down' and coming out of
hibernation, in such a bad mood?  Thinking in terms of parking it, adding
more oil, and draining the excess before I fire it up after a long time
down..

If this is too stupid, can I still come here and ask questions and get the
great help?

Curiosity gets me every time.....

Thanks,

John
