Subject: [T2] Sunroof opening/poptops??

List,

I have been a subscriber for some time and have not seen any posts
regarding sunroof openings.
I have a 76 transporter that I am in the process of restoring, I would
like to turn it into a poptop if possible and have a couple of
questions..  It has a sunroof that measures approx 3' x 3'8&quot;. Is this
the same size opening that a poptop has? if so has anyone ever seen this
done before?? I just ordered a new engine from Bus Depot yesterday and
asked them they said they hadn't seen a bus with such a big sunroof.. Is
this thing stock ?? It sure looks it ..Lastly am   I    crazy to attempt
this at all  ( Don't answer that one I already know the answer)

Thanks in advance
Kevin
