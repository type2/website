Gotta get a Bentley! And a Muir, mainly cuz it's customary and colorful.
:-) They explain the whole procedure. If I can do it, you can, too.
Also, get a stepped (go/no-go) feeler gauge and a door panel puller (my
two cents).

Others can give you more detail as to the specific workings of the
valves, but basically having the proper valve clearance effects the
efficient performance of the valves and the internal heating of the
engine. If your valves are tight, your engine will get hotter faster,
and either wear out or seize up far, far sooner than it would if you
adjusted your valves every 6,000 miles (or 3,000 or 1,500, depending on
who ya talk to).

Different people have different takes on valve adjustments -- read Muir,
who determines TDC by the distributor position and timing gauge; read
Mike G.'s recent e-mail about how to determine TDC by sticking a long
pencil in the #1 spark plug hole to find TDC visually; and I know people
who find TDC visually for each cylinder by hand-turning the engine while
they're under it (looong arms!).

Of course, if you have hydraulic lifters all of this is moot -- those
lucky souls don't have to do valve adjustment as their valves are
self-adjusting (it's a miracle!). You'll have to ask someone else how to
determine if you have hydraulic lifters, that's out of my realm of experience.

&gt; Sorry, I'm new to some things.  What exactly does valve adjustment
&gt; involve?  I've seen the postings on it, but what exactly do you do?  How
&gt; does it affect the engine?  All that good stuff, never done it before,
&gt; I'm just a (very) basic engine guy, I don't think I've ever taken the
&gt; valve covers off.
