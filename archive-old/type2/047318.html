Subject: Re: [T2] 1974 VW Safari engine questions

Yes , I had a 73 westy and it was from the end of that production year. It had
an 1800 and i was the second owner the first never having done anything beyond
a tuneup. My understanding is that the switch occurred at the end of 1973. the
1700 was very short lived.
jamie

&gt; &gt;    From what I hear, 1974 had 1700 engines. I have a dual carbed 1700
&gt; &gt;engine with an automatic tranny.
&gt;
&gt; Where did you hear that?  Every manual I've seen states otherwise.  1974
&gt; model year U.S. busses came with 1800 engines from the factory.
