&gt; Happy Holidays folks...
&gt; I need assistance with extracting an automatic transmission.  Bentley is not
&gt; clear enough for me.  I have two cables on a lever mechanism.  One lower,

it is very unclear.

&gt; secured by a &quot;c&quot;clip that came off nicely.  The upper cable is a ball / cone
&gt; connection, connected to the accelerator shaft.

right and that cone does indeed come off the ball, but it is a PITA. I
have found that something like a long nose plier that can get on both
sides at the same time will often get it, but hit it with PB BLaster or
something like that a LOT to lossen it up.. it is VERY easy to break and
next to impossible to fix (ask me how I know)

&gt; My folks are telling me to remove a rivet on the tubing in the front of the
&gt; transmission and all will come off nicely...My question is, how does the

should need to do that if you have taken the &quot;C&quot; clip off but also remove
the bracket that hold s the cable to the side of the transmission (two
13mm bolts if I remember correctly

&gt; cone connection come off the ball?

VERY CAREFULLY  it often is sticky but it will come off.,


&gt;
&gt; In the for what it is worth department, I cut the cable on the donor bus,
&gt; and now I am told these are NLA anywhere..

oh I am crying, I don't want to tell you what Busted Bus wants for one of
those I have gone hundreds of miles to just pull that cable from a junker


&gt;. So I need to be very careful on
&gt; the good bus.

that cable is fairly tought and you shouldn't have to take it out,
although adjusting the new tranny when you put it in really is a pain but
just folloow the Bentley instructions carefully and it will work.

while you have it out one thing you should do is replace the Torque
converter seal, these are avaliable and less than $20 (I got some from Bus
Depot)

BUT THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT when putting in a torque convertor seal it
does not tell you in Bentley that it is NOT pushed all the way in but
rather is flush with the top of the transmission housing where it goes.
this lookss and feels wrong but it is the CORRECT location for it, never
push it all the way in or you will pull your engine again to fix it...

good luck
