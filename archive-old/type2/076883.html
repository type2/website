Subject: Engine HP

I'm try to decide what I should do?  I have the opertunity to by a 1.8 914 engine 1975. Or I can rebuild my stock 2.0 1978 FI California emition.  They both will need to be rebiuld regardless.  What engine has more HP?  Which is better?  I know the 914 has a better cooling condition but will i benifit from the 914 reuild vs the 2.0?? Thanks Mike
