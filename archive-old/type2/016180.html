Please, don't even think about it.  The Olds probably weighs around 3,000
lbs and it would be nearly impossible for the bus to tow it.  I tow a small
trailer (around 500 lbs) and even that is a strain on my 2.0 FI bus.  I also
towed a 3,000 lb travel trailer for a couple of years with my 4.0L, 190 hp
Jeep Cherokee and that was an excessive strain even though the Jeep was
rated to tow 5,000lbs.  The bottom line is the bus won't work.

&gt;Need an answer to a possible problem... How much will a 78 Westy with a
2.0L FI engine tow?  I may need to go to Colorado &gt;Springs and tow my
daughters car home to Arkansas.  I am really not wanting to drive my
husbands truck.  She has a Old_mobile &gt;98.  Thanks
