Subject: comment on &quot;Steering's Gone!&quot;

Yes it's happened to me twice; and I got my parts van with the same
problem- the housing for the swing lever bushing that holds the swing lever
rots away and with luck you will notice the &quot;mushy&quot; steering with lots of
free play before it separates.  Usually one side separates first, and you
have some warning- ALWAYS CHECK THE HOUSING when you grease the front end
(YOU DO GREASE IT YOURSELF&lt; YES?????)- have someone yank the steering wheel
side to side with wheels on the ground, and you'll see it rocking if it's
pretty far gone.  When mine first separated (hanging on by a piece at top),
I gas-welded 1/8&quot; thick bar stock first to the torsion tube, then around
the bushing housing and back to the torsion tube, did this for both sides
and tack welded the housing to the bar.  A real mess with the grease oozing
around, but worked for a long time until I found another front end.   The
swing lever is needed because you steer IN FRONT of the wheels and must
relay this force via the lever to the tie rods.  No why hasn't some smart
fabricator come up with a housing+bushing with BOLT-ON wings that clamp
around the torsion tube to replace this weak spot?????
