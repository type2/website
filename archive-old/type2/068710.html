Subject: RE: heating '66

The only problem I had when I did as Markus has done is too much success:
at highway speeds I was getting so much heat through the insulated pipe
that it melted the bilge pump.  Even a bilge pump moves so little air 
relative to the engine cooling fan that I can't imagine there's any risk
to the engine.
