Subject: How do you know if a trans is good?

I have a 78 bus transmission which is out of the bus which I don't know the
condition. I have a 68 stretched bus which is V-6 powered and was wondering
if I could take advantage of the better gearing of the 78 trans. Any help or
comments would be greatly appreciated.
