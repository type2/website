Subject: Accelerator cable hole from '74 to '75
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.20.0104271100550.21825-100000_at_csa.bu_dot_edu&gt;

Hi all,

I've spent the week of lovely weather here in New England installing
my (not so) new engine in my (not so) new bus ;).
The bus is a '74 that had stock dual carbs. I'm installing a '75 1800cc in
this bus, FI and all. Everything is complete except for hooking up the
accelerator cable. Part of the bus's frame blocks the hole where the cable
would pass through on the '75. The cable on the '74 passes through the
front tin towards the left side of the tin. The '75 is a bit right to the
middle, where the throttle valve is. But, theres the frame in the
way. There are a few holes about 5 cm from where I want to be but it makes
the cable scrape against the grommet (mucho resistance). If i drill a hole
on the tin, there is too much of an angle for the throttle to work
properly. I'm sure this is a somewhat common problem. I have a new cable. 
What can I do? Drill a hole in the frame? (!) Use a hook and pulley
system? I'd just like to hear how others have dealt with this and how
well their solutions have worked.

thanks in advance
