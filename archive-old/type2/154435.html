Subject: Re: [T2] front curtain

Kevin,

    I had a customer once that was in the same bind as you, no curtains, and
a trip to take. His solution was to go to Wal-Crap and buy enough material
to cover the window openings. He then used magnets to hold them in place.
Worked for him ask a temporary fix.
    A few places to get material would be Wally World of course, Hancock
Fabrics, a furniture repair shop, Auto Upholstery shop.
    I like the Windshield shade idea. Low bucks, quick and easy to store.

Howard
