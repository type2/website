Subject: Oil filer or no? Opinions?

Hi,

We got our '68 Westy this past January which was suffering from some
maintenance neglect. We pulled the engine which has 53K original miles on it
(sat a lot). We had the heads rebuilt and we're replacing seals and gaskets,
etc. We aren't doing a full rebuild.

My question is whether we should put an oil filter on the engine or just
wait until the rebuild and have the case bored for the full flow filter?
Without the full flow I would have to use the oil pump cap with the two
fittings with a line to the oil filter. I was told that this set up wouldn't
have much flow so it's not worth doing.

So, should I just go with NO filter at all? Is there a significant (worth $$
and energy) benefit to using the non-full flow oil filter as opposed to
nothing at all w/ doing the oil changes? We planned on using synthetic oil.

Thanks,
Jen
