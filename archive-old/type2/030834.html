Subject: AVP Engine, adjust HYD Lifters

I bought an AVP engine for my '73 bay last year and it has given me
problems what so ever until recently.  Well, it actually isn't the
engine's fault, my own.  There was a vacuum leak in my brake booster which
I had a devil of a time trying to figure out.  Part of that process was
letting a mechanic look at it.  First thing he did was try to adjust the
lifters.  Bad idea.  The problem got worse, eventually I found the leak
and fixed that but know the lifters were all out of whack.  So I called
the lovely 800 AVP number and asked the mechanics there what to do for the
Hydraulic lifter adjustment for their engines.

	(1)get TDC for that cylinder
	(2)turn the adjustment screw out until it isn't touching the
lifter at all
	(3)check to make sure the lifter is stiff by pressing it in,
shouldn't be squishy(you can turn the engine over to pump it up)
	(4)turn the screw in until there is no lash
	(5)turn in one full turn and there you go

they said that in their experience(on their engines, which I believe use
Mark Stephen's heads) this makes for the most reliable setup and
longevity. Also, it is a common misconception that hydraulic lifters don't
need to be adjusted but in practice they will need it about every year
depending on the miles you put on the engine.  Look at it this way: It
can't hurt to do it if you do it right.  Just thought I would share this
little tidbit. 

I am sure that someone will have something contradictory to say about all
this but it works for me.  BTW I owned a '68 Bronco(ugly) that had hyd
lifters and the manual said &quot;Adjusted for Life...&quot;  but after adjusting
them once and getting 4 mpg better mileage I don't agree. bye.
