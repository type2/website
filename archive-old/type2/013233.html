Scott McWilliams is flying into Sacramento tomorrow afternoon 
to pick up his T34 Ghia, and I was thinking it would be kinda
cool if we could have a quick local get-together.  There's
a nice Italian restaraunt by my house on Fair Oaks that's got 
good food, is reasonably priced, and a couple of the people that work
there have VW's (I've seen a '67 bug, a 60's crew cab, and a SQB)

Maybe 7ish or so?

Thom
