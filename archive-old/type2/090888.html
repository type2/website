Subject: Re: [T2] Removing the side cover necessary to replace side window?

&gt; I'm outside looking at the rear drivers side window that some idiot smashed

&gt; it appears to be pretty much arc-welded on there, I got one screw out, need
&gt; to remove the other, then what???

[...]

3 screws, front, middle, rear (at least on my '71)

Remove them and tap the cover upward with a rubber hammer.  It is a
friction fit in a groove in the body.  It might take a fair whack to get
it moving.
