Wow. Looks a lot like a warthog from the game &quot;Halo&quot;.

The problem is that the modern automotive manufacturing corporations  
are more interested in pleasing their stockholders than their customers.

I've often wondered if the &quot;open-source&quot; style of software  
development could be applied to the automobile industry. Since the  
major automotive manufacturers have already outsourced the  
manufacture of most of their components, would it be all that  
difficult to design a basic chassis capable of supporting a user- 
defined selection of suspension, power-plants and interior components??

This could be the new &quot;peoples car&quot;.


Happy trails,
