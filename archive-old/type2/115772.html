&gt; Also, the inspection plate on the bottom of the 914

Oil temp. The 914 center console had clock, oil temp and volt gauges. The
oil temp senders were often but not always rated for 400F and matched to the
temp gauge. I don't believe the 400F sender will work with any VDO gauge you
buy from the online vendors. Luckily it's cheap and easy to replace the
sender unless you've already put the oil in. The rating for the sender is
printed on the side of it.

&gt; The 2L 914's heads will generally run hotter than on a
&gt; bus. Keep that in mind. I still have to hook up my
&gt; temp gages. Any way, those are just some thing that I
&gt; know (or think I know) about the 914 conversion. I
&gt; can't say anything on performance yet. I have not
&gt; driven it with this engine yet. Good Luck!

Sounds great. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
