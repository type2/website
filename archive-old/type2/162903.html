Subject: Re: [T2] AC

	I hesitate to encourage argumentation on this non-issue, but 
if rubbish is allowed along the lines of red herrings from
&gt;  &quot; Brrrrrr, Pop, Bang, Pow!  &quot;
		then I suppose I should try to lay this wrangle to rest.


&gt;  &lt;&lt; At the top of the list is the fact that R12 is killing the Ozone
&gt;layer.&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Did---as we are / were told.

	The depletion continues as freons (&amp; other ozone-destroying 
gases) float up into the stratosphere.  It is not in dispute among 
experts.   Newly-released freon will deplete the ozone layer after a 
decade or two.  The releasing has to stop!


&gt;I've got a problem with the propaganda that the EPA feeds us.
&gt;Nobody mentions that the Space shuttle, and every Atlas missiles
&gt;carrying who know's what upstairs, take along with itself ozone
&gt;depleting burnt fuel gasses--
&gt;direct to the layer--Live, and blow big holes in it.
&gt;Nobody says a word about that--
&gt;Nobody reminds anybody about that issue.
&gt;It's good for NASA, it's gotta be good for me.
&gt;
&gt;Just think--one blast of an Atlas missile up yonder is equivalent to all
&gt;the cars exhaust here and in Europe, and for 3 months worth of a ozone
&gt;burn.
&gt;This is a good deal.

	It's news to me that these are the estimates for the relative 
effectiveness in ozone-layer depletion.  But, supposing for the sake 
of argument that it is so, the answer is of course the solid moral 
principle that two wrongs don't make a right.

&gt;
&gt;&lt;&lt;I am not a tree hugger. But releasing R12 into the atmosphere is both
&gt;illegal and has an adverse effect on mother earth.&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Maybe.

	I've been in environmental science since before this issue 
emerged, and have watched it go from 'fringe propaganda' thru to its 
current status as thoroughly respectable science.  The same creeps 
who drafted dismissive letters for Ministers of the Crown when I 
wrote about ozone-layer depletion 3 decades ago now get junkets to 
foreign confabs and have long since come to agree with the Nobel 
prizewinners who pointed out the catalytic destructiveness of freons 
(etc) on the ozone layer.

	Whatever the US EPA may say on other issues, on this it is 
representing solid science.  The extra flux of UV (especially at high 
latitudes e.g where I live) is proven, and the explanation is as the 
scientists agreed leading to the Montreal treaty to control 
ozone-depleting chemicals.

	For those few who are vague about these issues, note that 
ozone depletion is far more settled science than climate degradation 
which is still disputed by a handful of expert dissenters e.g Lindzen.

	BTW regarding refrigerants more widely: independent experts 
have agreed, since it became clear that freons should no longer be 
released into the atmosphere, that there are excellent alternatives. 
They are not directly substitutable into existing A/C, but new ones 
should have converted many y ago to designs using either ammonia, or 
carbon dioxide, or LPG  -  well proven refrigerants essentially 
straightforward to deploy.
