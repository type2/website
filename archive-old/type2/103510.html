Subject: Changing the fuel filter

Is there a trick I can employ the next time I change my '78 Bus' fuel 
filter so that I don't have to bathe in gasoline?  I waited until  I had 
almost no gas left (or so I thought) but still wound up very gas covered 
and smelly. (Made for interesting conversation at work, tho.)  I'm sure 
the answer is a simple one, but then I'm not very mechanically inclined. 
 Thanks, Beth in NJ
