Richard,

Technically, the small end of the boot slips onto a tube which
covers the axle.  Then the metal clip is secured over the small
end of the boot to hold it in place on the axle tube.

&gt; This is an image of the Febi and Lobro kits and they both have two extra
&gt; clips for the end of the boot.

There's ONE metal clip in the photos.  Those other two things
are the dished washer and the circlip which holds he CV joint
on the axle.

&gt; 
&gt; Why is my kit missing these two pieces?

Ask Bus Depot.



Since the topic of these clamps and CV boots has been broached,
let me get this off my chest...

I was reading a back issue of Forza magazine lasta month.
A guy at work is into Italian sports cars and he loaned me
that Ferrari enthusiast magazine to read.
There was an article which addressed early CV boot failure.
To paraphrase, too much grease or too thin of CV grease will
allow the grease to leave the CV joint and run into the boot.
Then centrifugal force takes over at speed and may cause the boot
to expand beyond it's intended size and possibly strike fixed
items, such as hot exhaust or metalwork.  (Of course the obvious
solution to this is to use the proper amount of the proper grease
only in the CV joint area.)  To prevent the CV boot from expanding,
attach zip ties around the accordian pleats of the boot, but do
not tighten the zip ties!  This way the boot cannot grow beyond
it's intended size.  It was also mentioned that the metal clip
for the small end of the boot could be omitted.  There is usually
enough of a ridge on the axle tube to keep the small end of the
boot in it's proper position.  And the boot will be allowed to
&quot;burp&quot; air from that place if it should ever need to.  That pretty
much sums up the Forza article on CV boots I read.  YMMV

TGIF!
