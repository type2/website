Subject: &quot;Retro grouch&quot;!!

Learned this phrase over the weekend. It refers to someone who prefers 
older bicycles and bike tech to the new stuff that's come out since about 
1980-85. (And therefore suits me to a T.)

Seems an aptly descriptive designation for someone who would rather have 
an old bus than a Cadillac SUV. 

That's me: retro grouch squared.
