Subject: Exhaust manifold for a 77 2L?

Hello all.  While replacing the # 3/4 head this afternoon I found that the 
Exhaust manifold was nearly cracked in half.  I removed the shrouding from 
around the tubes and attemped to weld, with little luck.  It appears to be a 
high alloy steel.  So here I am, asking if anybody in the Seattle area has a 
used one, or knows where locally I could get a used one?  New one?

In desperation,

Marcus
