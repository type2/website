Subject: Fwd:  RE: Cheap buses

 Hi,
	There must be a big variation in availability depending on
where you are. I wouldn't touch a bus under £1000 because it would
be a money pit.

 Remember that the original poster said he didn't have a lot of time
on his hands and that this was his first bus. That puts him into a 
different category from an experienced home mechanic.

 Personally, I've bought three buses and have generally bought the
best one I could find at the time. There have always been cheaper
ones available, and they've always needed significantly more work.
 Admittedly I have avoided a couple of overpriced ones on sale
from dealers along the way.

 IMHO, if you don't have time to work on a bus yourself, you will 
have to accept that it won't be particularly cheap to own, as it's
a high maintenance vehicle and you'll have to pay for the time
that it takes. In this case I would say the important things are
to find a mechanic that you can trust (must be a VW enthusiast),
and to find a bus that doesn't need restoring. 

 There's a difference between possibly paying a little over the 
odds for a good bus, and getting ripped off. If someone says they
paid $250 for a bus, then spent every weekend for two summers
making it driveable then IMHO, they've ripped themselves off, not
acquired a bargain. Vehicle restoration as a hobby shouldn't
be confused with vehicle ownership as a hobby!!!

 Remember that time is money, sometimes it just doesn't make sense
to do the work yourself. If you buy a £4000 bus instead of a £4000
car and look after it it will keep its value well, That means that
you can spend hundreds a year on maintenance and still end up ahead,
as long as you can live with the fuel consumption. It can make
economic sense.

 No offence intended, just trying to offer perspective.

Cheers,
	W.
