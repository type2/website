Subject: Re: [T2] Strange Tranny Action [long]

From: &quot;Doktor Tim&quot; &lt;doktortim_at_rockisland_dot_com&gt;
&gt; This symptom is typical of a pilot bearing worn out and grabbing the
&gt; mainshaft. You didn't say you replaced it. You will have to do a re-do and
&gt; remove the flywheel to replace this $2 bearing.


Just for the record--the engine is an AVP re-build that I installed. It came
with flywheel attached, pilot bearing installed. I removed and tested the
bearing prior to assembly and found it to meet new spec. Not an oversight or
a compromise.

Regards,
Dave
