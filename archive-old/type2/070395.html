&gt; Don't know what to tell you. I take that 1 13/16 and a six-foot water pipe
&gt; and *wail* on stuff. I always win. ;) The air socket looks far beefier than
&gt; its chrome brethren, much thicker walls. I can't imagine why a tool
&gt; designed for sharp bursts of torque would break from sustained pressure
&gt; (although I can imagine a problem the other way around, from being
&gt; brittle).
&gt; 
&gt; In some of these rusty axle nut scenarios, I bet people have enough
&gt; leverage to get up around 1000 ft/lbs. I want a socket with B U L K.

From my experience, impact sockets are a ton tougher. I heft a big one
inch air gun around all day (i sell truck tires-what a crappy job) and
I've never had a socket for it break. If (more like when) i ever have to
break that big rear axle nut on my westy, you can bet I won't be leaning
on a big breaker bar...whirrrrrrrrrr...all done. :) 
take care,
