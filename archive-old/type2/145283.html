Here is the best procedure I know, since you've already done the
penetrating oil/vice grips/heat route:

Get a set of Left Hand drill bits.

Grind the top of the broken stud flat.

Carefully center-punch the stud, getting as close to the true center as
you can.

Drill the stud with a left-hand drill that is small enough that you are
sure that it will not get into the threads.

Drill the stud with progressively larger drills.  If you are lucky, the
drill will stick in the stud and back it out.

If the stud doesn't back out, you will eventually see the threads peeking
through the side of the drilled hole.  Now you should be able to take a
pin punch and hammer and work the remains of the stud out of the hole.

If you _really_ get the drill centered, you will see threads all the way
around the drilled hole.  If so, you can take a pair of needlenose pliars
and pull the remaining thread out of its groove.

If the above frightens you, take the job to a machinist.  They do this
sort of thing all the time, but they charge more if they have to work
around a broken EZ-out!
