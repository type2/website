Subject: Re: [T2] Those bleedin' brakes!

&gt;the floor. I've got good fat pads all around, no leaks and no clue. 
&gt;I've read the 4 manuals I have - Bently, Muir, Haynes and Clymer, but 
&gt;nothing about this that I can find.

Here is my take on bleeding and what I've learned to do, everyone does
it differently, a pressure bleeeder is greatest method, I don't find that a
vacuum bleeder usually helps all that much over good ole 2 person job.
This works well enough for me so it is what I do, requires the extra foot.
Often the little bubbles are usually air sucked back in along the bleeder 
screw threads or a loose fitting hose. If the bleeder is open when you let
the pedal up these tiny bubbles can be sucked back in with each stroke.
A dab of something at the base of the screw (like a dab of thick grease)
can help seal the threads but it shouldn't be needed. Try just barely
opening the screws, just enough for fluid to flow without too much effort
for the pumper. Check that the hose fits VERY tight on the bleeder or go
get some that does (clear vinyl from hardware store.) Make sure end of
hose stays under fluid level and keep the bled fluid resevoir above the
bleed screw so it doesn't want to siphon (which it will only do if there
is a little air leak into the hose.) Then modify the technique. For the
initial purge phase of old fluid, with the bleeder cracked just enough 
one guy pumps fairly quickly and consistently almost to the floor until 
2-3 ounces come out or it gets clear whichever you prefer, then as you 
hear him pumping the other guy closes the valve on the downstoke 
of the pump so nothing is sucked back (the closer will be feeling the
brakes tighten up some as it pumps to get the timing.) Then pumper
pumps 5-10 times and holds,  bleeder cracks the screw so the pedal
JUST falls not all the way to floor.  Do this pump, hold, crack 3-4 times,
move on to the next in the order you mention. If after this still problems,
well I don't know maybe problem in the master cylinder if pedal is still
bad or falls by itself with continued pressure when they are applied.
Make sure the rears are well adjusted and no leaks one more time, I
know you have. Sometimes stuff is just odd. Bad pedal can also be bad 
crappy old hoses, if more than 10 years old (less even better) replace 
em now. Cheap about $10 each at shows maybe a bit more from Ron.
I was amazed how bad the ones on the '82 I recently replaced were, as
bad as I'd ever seen and leaking into the reinforcement layer bubbling the
outer covering up subtly near the ends.  After major brake service or for
a bus new to me I can easily run through an entire quart of new Castrol
GT/LMA DOT4 fluid for the initial purge/change.
