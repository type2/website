&gt; &gt; Vacuum in your fan shroud???  No, maybe a 'low pressure area' but not
&gt; &gt; vacuum.
&gt; -------------------------------------
&gt; Low pressure???  Isn't the purpose of the fan to pull air (generating a less
&gt; than atmospheric condition = vacuum) and exhaust that air for cooling?

Inside the fan shroud should be pressurized slightly, say a couple of
inches of mercury.

The manifold produces a fair vacuum, say about 10 inches of mercury on
average.

The only source for power brake vacuum is the manifold, unless you have
some sort of fancy vacuum pump such as the ones on Diesel cars.
