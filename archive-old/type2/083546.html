&gt; Any Ford. Visit any flaps. You need one with two large lugs that were used

The problem with the Ford relay is that is is a high-current device which
takes quite a bit of current (about the same as the stock VW solenoid)
through the ignition switch for its own coil.
What is really needed is a lower current relay such as the Bosch relay
that is sold specifically for this purpose.
