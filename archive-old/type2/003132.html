&gt; Last night I was over at a friend's house looking through a big stash of
&gt; parts he recently acquired.  A lot of it is '70s vintage and he has a
little
&gt; of everything.  One piece he showed me has to be of particular interest to
&gt; one of you out there.  Its one piece of the 3 color stripe package for a
&gt; dark brown mid to late '70s Bus.  The stripes are 3 shades of brown with
one
&gt; of them being a kind of rust color.  I'm sure you've all seen one of these
&gt; particular Busses before, I just don't know late bay windows that well to
&gt; know what option package that would be from.  This particular piece is
&gt; pretty long so I'm guessing its probably for the quarter panel but could
be
&gt; cut for use elsewhere if you need it.  If you're interested here's the
email
&gt; address: Kelly.McCaw_at_corp.palm_dot_com

Wern't those a part of the champagne edition package?
