older story about my 1960 23window deluxe.

I was a scout leader at the time and our troop was at the annual Camporee
and we were having a good old time, When late Sat afternoon we suddenly
get hit with a tornado.  (yes one boy was killed) most of the scouts did
the right thing and formed up on a nearby beach.....

   Since the campsites were destroyed and everything bar none was soaked
the kids were loaded into cars, parents were called etc.  but no scout was
allowed back into the campsite.

  I stayed behind to guard and help clear the campsite up, also I was the
only one left who was medic trained...My van was parked between two other
larger vans (fords I think) in any case a tree crashed down and clobbered
both other vans, mine was untouched and just needed a little brush
clearing and driving it into the clear.

  In anycase the next day the leaders who remained went in to recover as
much gear as possible.   drove my bus into the site after some trees were
removed.   looked around at the destruction and tried to figure out what
to do next????

   I opened the sunroof on the van and started throwing gear into the van
over the top.   when finished I lashed my canoe onto the roof and drove
back to the church.  I arrived with all of the gear and tents for 23 boys
and  3 other leaders, and my stuff all in this one van.  water (everything
was soaked) was dripping out of the side door and I was down on the shock
stops, probably could get it up to 35-40mph.  well the kids were waiting
and one runs up to the bus and opens the side door, and gets hit by a
tidal wave of water that had drained from all of the wet stuff!  

  That probably was the heaviest I ever packed any of my vans, soaking wet
gear was up to the sky windows.  It was also one of the saddest uses of my
van, three days later we used it to haul a half dozen of my scouts down to
the funeral of the scout that was killed....his scoutmaster was a friend
of mine and he was totally destroyed, never was the same after that

in any case, just thought I would share a &quot;survivor&quot; tail in which the VW
bus played a major role.  more than utilitarian that was for sure

this happened over 20 years ago and it is still one of those &quot;moments&quot; in
history in my life.
