Subject: FS 71 Westie &amp; 74 Adventure (HiTop) FLA

We're quickly running out of storage space at the new shop and so are in
the process of shifting and shuffling vehicles.  As we don't (haven't yet
anyway)
do full-on restorations on our later model friends, we've decided to offer a
pair up for grabs.

1971 Westie... Cranberry Red, White top
        Good body, minor surface rust, nose/tire ding
        Interior is in good shape, but missing sink/fridge
        Pop-Top seal has been replaced recently, canvas has
        a few softball sized tears, but isn't dry rotted.
        Disks front (first year) big 5-lug wheels (last year)
        Brake Booster is fine as is the tranny.
        Good radial tires.........
                With-out motor  price is        1,250.00
                With 1600 SP motor rebuilt      1,850.00

1974 Adventure &quot;HiTop&quot; Camper (California Camper)
        Indian red w'indian red and white top
        Good body, very minor surface rust, no dings
        Interior is in very good shape and complete, but no fridge
        cabinetry needs repair (hinges and some delaminating)
        Z-bed with black vinyl rear-seat combo (stock)
        Jalosie crank out windows in roof w/12&quot; roll up air vent up top
        Pressurized fresh water holding tank
        2-burner propane stove and 3lb undercarriage LPS system
        Catalytic propane heater built-in to cabinetry (stock)
        90% original (not messed with by p.o.)
        Headliner is in near perfect shape, but has coffee(?) stain
        New motor and tranny mounts,has new (optional) radials.....
                With-out motor price is         1,650.00
                with rebuilt 1800 t2 carb       2,450.00

Both buses were trade-ins towards restorations and are physically and
mechanically very sound.  both should be easy home restorations as all
parts are there. Cosmetic attention is required, but little else.

Willing to trade for pre-67 buses, delivery available in US
