Another option to powder coating is hot-aluminum coating (or whatever
it's called).  A few high-tech coating companies can spray aluminum
at it's liquid temp, and coat metal like paint.  All you need to do
is blast the surface of the metal, and new heater boxes are the
ideal surface.  What I have wondered, though, is would it be worth
it to separate the tin of the heater box so the inside could also
be sprayed?  Then you would just need to tack weld the tin back
together, and finish spray the outside.  I figure, with only summer
driving, my exhaust should last MANY years if properly conditioned,
and in 10 years, I don't think I want to buy new German heat exchangers
for a '71, if they're even available!  In the past 8 years they have
gone
up over $40 each!  Very expensive.....

Any comments on this would be appreciated.
