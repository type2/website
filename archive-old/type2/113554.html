&gt;Don't laugh, this actually does happen. Both my father in law and brother in
&gt;law have had their oil drain plugs stripped out by the &quot;lube technicians&quot; at
&gt;good ole wally world. I beliee my brother in law actually got them to pay for
&gt;reparing or replacing the oil pan.

Saw a Peugeot once with a brand new cast allow oil pan and yes, the brand 
new drain plug threads stressed and have to be turned out all the way with 
a wrench. And yes, with the appropriate new bright slices around the head 
of the new drain plug from the Vise Grips from the first install, but it 
only cost $19.95 so is was cheap, thank God for small favors.
