There is a fellow around here that has done this conversion,,Subaru engine
in Late Bay, and it required a lot of modification to his gas tank.

So, if your willing to put a BIG notch in the center of your gas tank to
clear the injection intake housing on the subaru engine, go for it!

You could relocate you fuel tank I guess that might be another option,
when he was done the original fuel tank looked like a &quot;C&quot;

he also grafted the subaru gas tank sender and fuel pump into the original
bus tank.

&gt; &gt; Probably shouldn't say anything yet until the birth...but, I'm knee-deep
&gt; &gt; in doing this to my 78 Westy right now.  Got a Legacy for $600 bux and
&gt; &gt; gutted it for what I need.  Really looking forward to having A/C and
&gt; &gt; cruise!  Went the Kennedy Engineered Products route and am very pleased
&gt; &gt; with their workmanship and customer service.  Go here and search the
&gt; &gt; library for the engine conversion article &quot;2.2 Subaru Engine in 1984 VW
&gt; &gt; Westfalia&quot; for a good start on the road.
&gt;
&gt; Hmmm, Kennedy discourage use of the 2.2 Legacy engine in bays, citing a
&gt; clearance issue between the air inlet and gas tank.
&gt;
&gt; I really didn't want to use the smaller 1.8 subaru engine, but if the 2.2
&gt; (or 2.5!) is viable this might be more attractive.
&gt;
&gt; What are you doing to get around this supposed interference?
