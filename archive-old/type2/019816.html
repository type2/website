[...]I have a friend who put a 74 beam on his 71 - drove it for years
that way.

&gt; &gt; Oh, my, two rusted out beams in one day...  'tis the season, apparently
&gt; &gt; :-(
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On interchangeablitiy:  I *know* that '73-79 beams will all interchange, I
&gt; &gt; am told that '68-71 beams will interchange, and I *think* that '68-79
&gt; &gt; beams will interchange.  Having said that, I should also remind everyone
&gt; &gt; that '68-70 beams, with rare exception are drum brakes, that '71-72 (and
&gt; &gt; some '73 beams) are one disk system, and that '73-79 are a different disk
&gt; &gt; system.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My experiences are all with '73-79 late disk brakes.  I know that a '79
&gt; &gt; beam will fit a '73 body.  I've done it. Beyond that I invite others to
&gt; &gt; testify.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On installation, there is a whole write up in the library.  I won't repeat
&gt; &gt; myself :-)  The URL is:
&gt; &gt; http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/beam.htm
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The one addition I would make is that I had some doubt on the heater tube.
&gt; &gt; On a '73 this is a metal tube and passes over the beam.  On a '78 it is a
&gt; &gt; paper tube and passes thru the beam.

&gt; &gt; P.S.:
&gt; &gt; Happy New Year!
