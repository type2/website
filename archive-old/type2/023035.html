Why don't you just buy one of the solid-state replacement regulators from 
your local FLAPS?  The stocker probably cuts out at a low voltage due to 
age and it's mechanical mechanism.  The new ones will cut out between 13.5 
and 14 volts and will do a much better job of charging an auxiliary 
battery.  The ones I have seen are Wells brand (I seem to recall the part 
number being something like VR-xxx, maybe VR-980?) and are about $18 from 
Autozone.  Much easier than adapting something else IMO.
