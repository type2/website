Subject: RE: Re: [T2] Propane Problems (busted by the fire marshal)

&gt;And Propane will not kill you... Lack of Oxygen will.  

Yeah, right.  I guess the CO is actually what gets you.  Or those dreaded flames that come when you catch something in your bus on fire.  Bottom line- you know that a portable propane tank and heater are not safe heat for you bus.  

We want the Snoop around to take next years Full Moon pics.  Maybe somebody will send the Snoop one of those old aux heaters for you.  


&gt;those squirrel cage blowers do nothing except at idle.  The engine fan
&gt;overpowers those blowers as soon as it is moving.  If you want real power
&gt;install a bilge blower midstream. 
&gt;
Squirrel cage, bilge blower.  I don't know my fans.  Bulley treatment all the way, though.  
Has anyone guessed the bus on your webpage?  68-70 with newer nose piece, right?  Old style axles are obvious.  I'm not good enough to do better than that.
