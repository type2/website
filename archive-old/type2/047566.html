I have converted a few cars that had sealed systems to 134.  No problems...I
believe the problems occur with a system that has problems...i.e.  most vw
systems......someone needs to replace o-rings, etc, vacuum test system
before converting.  I think that the internal pressures are different for
r12 and r134, and thus the hose ratings may be different.  If your hoses are
shaky, by all means replace (have a shop crimp old ends on new line) before
converting.

&gt; James,
&gt;
&gt; The one other thing I've heard is esteroil (one of the
&gt; new oils for R134A) tends to seal old hoses and lets
&gt; you get by with R134A.  The real test would be if
&gt; someone has successfully done this conversion without
&gt; changing compressor and hoses.  I actually wouldn't
&gt; mind a slight leak with R134A.  One or two cans of
&gt; this per year wouldn't hurt me or the environment.
&gt; One or two cans a month is a little too leaky.
