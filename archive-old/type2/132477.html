Subject: Re: [T2] Hubcap sighting

Hi Mike,

Jamie Rivers made the frame, using an old globe holder. This helps keep 
people from smudging the names off of it, and it looks cool. The box is 
still traveling with the hubcap, and apparently there is quite a 
substantial pile of mementos in it.

Happy trails,
