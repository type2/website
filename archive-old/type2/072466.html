If it is all original Mexican parts, I wonder what engine size/horsepower he had. If it was the old 62 horsepower diesel, he wasn't going anywhere fast. 
Might as well go with the TDI, even though it costs a little more. $5,000 for just the parts is not bad if you consider the amount of parts needed. Labor should be another $3.000 to $5.000!!! Might be better off (cheaper) buying a wrecked diesel vehicle, and use the parts off it. Then you might get lucky and get German parts instead of Mexican parts. (quality in question). Customize the rest.

&gt;&gt; There was a little nutty guy at the VW Auburn Hills show this past Spring

&gt;&gt; all original Mexican bus parts. He even had a converted bus there to show
&gt;&gt; off.  Price tag without installation?  $5,000.
&gt;
&gt;Why does this sound outrageously high to me?


Well, if it is a professionally done installation, using only original VW parts 
and a factory new engine. It is dirt cheap, and still less expensive than the 
1776 I built for my single cab.
