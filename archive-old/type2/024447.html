I am still the US source for the Carver P4 heater.  You can find the P4 
information on my web pages as well as pricing.

I discount the P4, and further discount it for listmembers.  I have received 
email from the UK requesting me to ship the P4 there since it so expensive to 
buy it locally.  The Carver is a very good value when you compare it with 
similar German made units that cost more than twice as much.
