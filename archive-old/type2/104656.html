Subject: Re: [T2] VW Emblem???

&lt;&lt;  Is there anywhere that I can
get the front Volkswagen emblem for my girlfriend's bus and have it affixed
using some sort of an adhesive or double sided duct tape? &gt;&gt;

You're better off mounting the emblem with the original bolts. Almost any
glue or tape that I can think of will require at least scuffing the paint to
get 'tooth' for the adhesive. Tapes will dry out and you'll lose the emblem
in the wind. Best bet is to make a thin cardboard template of the emblem
with the holes in it and use that to mark the holes in the nose. Measure
twice/three times before drilling - use a new bit in a variable speed drill
to 'cut' through the paint, then gradually increase the speed to get through
the metal...
