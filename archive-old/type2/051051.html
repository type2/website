Subject: RE: [T2]Weber carbs and Vac. booster question

Late 60's USA market Porsche 912s, with the upright engine 
have some kind of emission control system. For this system 
the 40mm dual Solex carbs are mounted on 5mm thick steel 
flanges. These flanges have a tiny hookup for 3mm vacuum 
hose. I used four of these flanges, paired the vacuum lines 
into one 3mm hose coming from each carb using Gates Y 
connectors, T connectors from any modern cars' window washer 
would work, then joined these two into a 10 mm hose just 
where they leave the engine compartment. These flanges should 
fit 40mm Webers without much difficulty. I don't think you 
would even haves to enlarge the mounting holes, Berg sells 
the same manifold for Solex 40 PII and Weber, only the 
mounting holes of each port are located at a different angle 
in relation to the other port. I've never done this with Webers, 
so you might want to check. The flanges were about $12 each 
from Porsche, but I think I got the last 3, and scored a NOS 
one to complete the set. In the US it might be a lot easier 
finding used ones. It is a clean installation. I use the 
4 hook-ups for synchronizing the carbs as well, I have one 
with 4 vacuum gauges, connect them to the vacuum hook-ups, 
adjust, re-connect vacuum lines to the booster, and close 
the lid. The synchronizing tool can be found at motorcycles 
shops I think, I got mine from Ahnendorp in Germany for 
about $80.
