&gt;Thanks, could I use the Naval Jelly instead of the Ospho and get the same

Naval Jelly is just that, a jelly and you won't be able to apply it to the inside of the tank. You could try to thin it out but I think you'd be better off with another product.

To remove the rust in the tank before using any chemicals, throw in a chain and rotate the tank, then wash out the loose rust.
