Subject: RE:[T2] LCD screen mods - keeping kids happy 
Mime-Version: 1.0


&gt;I'm interested in using an
&gt;older LCD screen from a dead laptop computer as a TV monitor in my Westy

Unfortunatly this isn't as easily done as you might think. Most LCD's will 
need special video cards to drive them...costs would be in the $300 and up 
range for a card that works.

There are some lower costs alternatives out there though. Check out the 
boards at http://www.mp3car_dot_com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi for more specific 
options. These guys have been doing this for a couple of years now and can 
put you in the right direction. Good Luck.
