I did mine myself. Maaco might have been cheaper; maybe even better. A lot
of work...mostly in prep (which Maaco probably won't do anyway). 

If you do it, don't expect to get it right the first time...and learn what
to do to make it right (prep coats, etc.). You probably can't do a good
job for under $400 when you consider undercoats, primer, paint, etc.

I'll probably do my next one too, but I'm thinking I'll try to take a
class first to learn how to do it right. Same thing with welding.
