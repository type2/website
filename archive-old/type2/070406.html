Subject: Re: westy roof

&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; 
&gt; Actually the &quot;newer&quot; style roof that you are referring to began 
&gt; being offered in the 1974 model year (at least in N. America)
&gt; 
&gt; The newer style pop top that opens towards the front would 
&gt; technically fit on your 71' but to get the upstairs bed 
&gt; functioning properly would require major surgery. It would be 
&gt; necessary to cut the top of the roof off and install the 
&gt; subcompartment in order for the upstairs bed to lay flat. 
&gt; Otherwise you would be slleping on a bed that followed the 
&gt; contour of the roof :)
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line is that it is technically feasible but it would be a 
&gt; buncha work, it would prolly be easier to buy a &gt;74' bus than try 
&gt; and retrofit your 71'
&gt; 
&gt; m.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; question...is there a difference in roof integrity between the 
&gt; body 
&gt; &gt; styles of 68-71 and 72-(end of breadloaf)?  the reason i ask is 
&gt; &gt; because i'm interested in putting a later model roof on my '71 
&gt; so 
&gt; &gt; i'll have the bigger bed up top.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; thanx

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
so, the &quot;newer&quot; model roof does not simply have a &quot;sunroof&quot; type hole 
in it?  i guess i never really checked it out, but i thought that 
bigger bed up there rested on some kind of support attached to the 
fiberglass roof itself.  oh well...

could i possibly get several opinions on this?  i'm missing a roof 
anyway and am having a hard time finding one with hardware and 
evertything...i like the later model better.

also, does anyone know much about the manual or electric 
sunroofs...looks like a black velourish type material.  i was quoted 
850 manuel or 1300 electric.  about 500 to install a pop-top roof.  
personally i like the look of a van without a poptop better...i think 
the curve is nicer.

finally, does anyone know, know of, or has had dealings with a person 
by the name of andy in grand bay, alabama.  he does all sorts of work 
and can turn any vw into a show car.  i was really impressed with the 
work that i saw...very cool.  btw, he has a lot of busses just 
sitting around (14, i think).  he also has a notchback and a split 
windshield pickup.  i think he wants $675 for the pickup...needs an 
engine overhaul, otherwise in good condition (for one as old and as 
inexpensive).

please respond
thanx
