Subject: Vanagon Seats in a 78' Bus?

My 78' Westy came without a driver's seat. The passenger front seat is
rather uncomfortable as well. I found I was able to put a drivers seat from
my buddy's 85' vanagon in no problem. What I'm wonering is:

(a) Will the passenger seat swap as well?
(b) Will all other year vanagon fron seats swap?

The vanagon seats are much more comfortable, but I dont want to by a set
from a junk yard only to ahve them not fit. Any help here would be
appreciated. I don't want to do any cutting or welding...
