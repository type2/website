&gt; OK, I think it would be wise for me to ID some of the parts I am
&gt; working with.
&gt;
&gt; Here are the part numbers for what I'm working with:
&gt;
&gt; AFM:
&gt; 0 280 200 020

doesn't match any number I've got,  the AFM numbers tend to be
022-906-301-and some letter

&gt;
&gt; ECU
&gt; 0 280 000 149

again ECU's should be 022-906-021-and some letter

&gt; Distributor

not sure about dizzys
