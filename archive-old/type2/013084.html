Frank:

I think it's pretty much accepted that floor panels should be welded in, not riveted.  As for body filler, the less used, the better.  Also, don't use Bondo brand body filler on a VW.  Bondo absorbs small amounts of moisture, which will lead to rust underneath the filler.  Use All-Metal or Metal-to-Metal, either is far superior.  Also, get to know the POR-15 family of rust-stopping products.
As for painting a big &quot;V&quot; on the front of a Bay window bus, if you do, I'll climb through the e-mail system to kick your butt.  Just kidding.  No, I don't believe painting your Bay window to look like a split window would be acceptable.  I know the big &quot;V&quot; looks cool, but if you really want one, sell your bay and buy a splittie.

&gt;As a new, very new owner, what is everyones opinion on body filler?  
&gt;Happy has a tremendous amount of filler, rivited floor panels, but darn 
&gt;does she look good.  Is this body work acceptable to the purist?  And 
&gt;about the paint scheme, I would like to add a &quot;V&quot; Nose two tone paint 
&gt;job in the future.  Is this considered appropiriate to the purist?
&gt;Thanx to all
