You are ruthless!  I would buy just about any complete bus for $100 sight-unseen.

&gt;Are there any major differences between the 2?

Yes.  Bumpers, marker lights, taillights are different.  Tranny is geared differently.  Engine is different displacement, clutch and flywheel are different (the '74 stuff is more desireable IMO).  There are differences in the heater controls.

&gt; are the brake systems the
&gt;same?

No.  The '74 has different calipers and rotors.

&gt; will the front axles swap?

Don't know for sure, but my guess is that they would.

&gt; Anything else you all knowing list members
&gt;call share about this transplant.

You have a lot of work ahead of you!

Good luck,

-David
