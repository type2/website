Subject: [T2] fuel line replacing snag..

i went out to redo my fuel lines today, and ran into quite a little
snag. on the passenger side line, the hose is stuck fast on the little
tab that comes from the gas tank. any suggestions on how to free it up?
i don't
want to break the thing off trying to pull it!
