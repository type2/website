Steve,
I've made the necessary Library and Archive searches and can't seem to find
very much info on this subject.  I'm going to buy the gauge today but am
unsure exactly how to use it and what information it will give me.  Any
advice, ramblings, or directions on where to go ( to find this information)
would be greatly appreciated.
TIA
