$800?????
Let's not make the neophytes nervous.  All you need is a 1-13/16&quot;
socket.  3/4&quot; drive is adequate.  Add to that an eighteen inch 3/4&quot;
drive T-bar and you have everything you need.  Maybe some scrap pipe
for some extra lever arm.  

I bought mine at Sears fifteen years ago.  Probably cost less than
$30.  With all the import stuff out there, you could probably do
better than that today.  I never had to use any violence to remove
the big nut.  Just stand on the end of the T-bar, grab on the the
body and pull. I weigh about 175 pounds.  No hitting with the sledge
hammer required.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I'm in the process of doing my own brakes; fronts were easy, rears 
&gt;have been
&gt;&gt; a whole 'nother story.  Sadly, I've not the five-fingered 
&gt;castellated nut
&gt;&gt; remover/puller thingy of death that Bentley says is required... 
&gt;and checking
&gt;&gt; Muir revealed that it's &quot;usually 36mm&quot;.... guess what?  It ain't.  
&gt;'Brought
&gt;&gt; a 36mm socket home to discover it's not even close.  What is the 
&gt;size,
&gt;&gt; anyway?  Am I approaching this from the right angle to start with? 
&gt; What
&gt;&gt; MUST I do to get those bloody hubs off so I can replace shoes and 
&gt;cylinders?
&gt;
&gt;Everyone else's response to remove just the drum and not the hub was 
&gt;right
&gt;on...you only remove the hub to service the bearings. But! Measure 
&gt;the
&gt;castellated nut with a ruler and you should find that it's 46mm. 
&gt;36mm nuts
&gt;(which you do have to remove to service the brakes, at least on a 
&gt;Type 1)
&gt;are found on Types 1, 3 and 4...not Type 2.
&gt;
&gt;To get this off you need a 46mm (or 1 13/16&quot;, that works too) socket 
&gt;on a
&gt;3/4&quot; or 1&quot; drive breaker bar or impact wrench. (One-inch drive? 
&gt;Sears has a
&gt;one-inch drive socket set in their Craftsman catalog. It costs $800, 
&gt;so
&gt;unless you were a mechanic at an oil refinery you probably wouldn't 
&gt;need
&gt;one.)
