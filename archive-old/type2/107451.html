Subject: RE: [T2]76-79 two piece collapsible cot

&gt; does anyone have one for sale?


I have NEW front-cab-area childs cots on factory closeout, for $39.95
(60% off of the $100 original price).  This includes the canvas and the
poles.

These have the '70-75 style one-piece poles, though, which do not
retract for storage under a '76-79 Westy sofabed. So while the cot will
fit thru '79, if you have a '76-79 Westy you'd either have to find a
different place to store it when not in use, or modify the poles to fold
or separate for storage. (Or keep an eye out for 2-piece poles down the
road. Sometimes you find them cheap at swap meets with ratty canvas, as
the poles tend to outlast the canvas.)  Also, the brackets that screw
onto the door pillars are not included (although if your bus is a Westy
you already have them.)
