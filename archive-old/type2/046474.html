Subject: [T2] brake shoe break through

i bought brake shoes. the seller is 3000 miles away. bus is using a cane.

the shoes did not come with the e-brake arms on two; all four shoes are the
same. take the old ones off and attach them to the new? has anybody on the
list done that before? 'cause mine are riveted, and there are no rivets
like the two i need in town. might someone suggest a replacement assembly
taking into consideration the special needs of these peculiar rivets.

i recently learned shoes sold without parking break arms are customary.
hopefully some on the list can share similar experience. this is a new
thing to me.

BIGthanks,
steve
