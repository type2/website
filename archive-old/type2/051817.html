Subject: [T2] Re: [VB] I killed my 68 DC engine

I too &quot;killed&quot; a bus engine on the Altamont pass, which turned out
to be parts of the governor that I'd modified to be less restrictive
(ie converted from a governor to a fancy-looking carb spacer) had come
loose and was rattling around in a couple cylinders, and had jammed 
one valve open.

I used to work for CDF (state fire department) in that area, an we saw
lots of VW's (as well as other makes) stuck on the side of the road.

&gt; I think I holed a piston or burned a valve. I found out why they call the
&gt; Altamont Pass the &quot;Bus killer&quot; as I only just started up trying to pass that
