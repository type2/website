Subject: Re: [T2] distributor 78 ?

Notice the position in the manuals (Bentley and Muir come to mind), rotate  
it slightly (curved gear teeth) and insert it allowing it to rotate to the  
right finished position. Yeah, TDC for #1 as I recall. If it isn't right  
then remove, rotate slightly and reinstall. A pencil cut off blunt or a  
small dowel rod fits the center hole fine and makes for a cheap removal  
tool. Cut off the pencil again if it begins to fit the hole loosely. As I  
recall there is a shim or two under the drive. Grease them up heavily, let  
them slide down a dowel rod into the hole in the block. Use the pencil to  
push them down and let the grease act as a temporary glue to hole them in  
place. Either the VW had shims or that is my Corvair engine... Hmmm...
