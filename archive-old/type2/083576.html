&gt; Has anyone ever tried to find a locking gas cap for the 71 style. Actually
&gt; it appears that a locking gas cap can't be made for this type of filler.
&gt;
&gt; This leads me to my next question. Has anyone ever fabricated a lock for the
&gt; filler door?
&gt;
You could take a new cap, weld a piece of strap metal to it, then mount a
corresponging piece of strap metal to one of the flange bolts below the
cap.  Put a hole in each and install a padlock throught the holes to
prevent the cap from being turned.
