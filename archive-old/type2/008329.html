Subject: More carb linkage/pedal/travel Q's........
To: type2 mailinglist &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Okay, yesterday I posted 2 questions: 1- why was there still excess
travel in my carbs linkage when the pedal was floored, and 2- my
throtle cable was sticking.

I later called a mechanic friend of mine (who lives in another state,
so I can't take the bus to him) and asked about the excessive travel,
he said there should only be .5mm-1mm play left. He used to work on my
bus and is familiar with my setup ('69 westy, 1600sp, POS 30/31 carb),
so I tend to trust him on this.

This got me to thinking that maybe the 2 problems are linked. I went
out and looked at the accel pedal and I wonder if it is bent and
causing the linkage to bind. Al Brase sent a note suggesting the same
thing, so I wonder even more now!

So here's the question: how can I tell if it's bent? On the rubber
floor-mat, there are 2 holes under the toe-section of the pedal and
they are linked by a slit. There are corresponding holes in the
sheetmetal as well, but nothing goes through them and they seem to
serve no purpose. Is the pedal supposed to line-up in the middle of
these holes? If so, mine's about an inch off. Is there a way to
re-align the pedal?

Are there new pedals available anywhere?

I'm going out to work on this in a few hours when it warms up, so any
advice before then would be greatly appreciated;-)


Jaime
