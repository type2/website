Subject: Das boot(s)

List,
Browsing the archives, i find fear welling up in me again.

The whole front end of my bus is torn down, minus the joints being pressed out
of the arms.

The joints  are fine - the boots are shot and i cut them off.

Scary part coming up... are boots available at all?  Why am i hearing mostly
silence when i ask this question?
