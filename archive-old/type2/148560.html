Subject: woo hoo! my first real ride in my bus

I'm smiling so hard it hurts.

It's been a journey to get here. I bought the bus last fall. - I
finally drove it home from my office today.

Well a lot has happened in between. Here's a brief list:

Bentley, Muir, lots of reading
voracious devouring of type2 posts, archives, library
some hours on the samba
carb/intake replacement (Weber to 34PICT3)
new windshield (took Safelight 3 tries to get it in, those seals
aren't flexible at 20deg F)
various tinkerings
a visit from Colin (AMSkeptic on the Samba) after which the bus still
didn't run (bad plugs)
tune ups - valves, endless hours of carb adjustment
a number of oil changes
parts from people on the list (thanks again for the air cleaner Will)
probably about $1000 of assorted parts from the bus depot including
new tires (hankook ra08 195s ride really nice)
new dizzy (009-&gt;bruck single vac. from cip1)

It was only a 10 mile ride home but included both some highway and
city driving. The bus ran great in all scenarios.

Still some minor issues, it was very hard to adjust the idle
accurately with the bypass screw - I'm thinking the rubber washer in
there may be shot. Also, it seemed to be running a bit rich. That
might be the old carb throttle plate modification I made to attempt to
get the 009 to function adequately or it might be the 135 main jet
I've got in there. Easy enough things to tinker with and fix. I've got
2 spare 34PICT3's sitting on my desk here now so spare parts are no
problem.

Shifting was also a bit krunky. I'll be ordering some new shifter
bushing tomorrow.

Thank you everyone for all you questions, tips, suggestion, and
overall knowledge and wisdom. I could not have done it as easily and
learned so much without you all!

Time for a beer, a smoke, and a donation to the type2 list.

The journey continues.

Peace!
