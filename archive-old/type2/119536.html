You could elaborate with the specific load your planning to install,,,

&gt; I am interested in installing a dedicated accessory circuit in my 72
&gt; Campmobile, utilizing a secondary battery.  Has anyone had experience with
&gt; this kind of thing?  The archives made no reference,and I'm wondering if
the
&gt; stock alternator would be enough to keep both batteries charged.  Since I
&gt; understand that alternators only work at about half capacity in a normal
mode,
&gt; I wonder if having an inline switch would be a suitable answer to that
problem
&gt; or if I would need to acquire an alternator with higher output capacity.
 Any
&gt; help would be appreciated.
