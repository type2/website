Subject: Leaving for Missouri tomorrow

Hello, just wanted to say good by for awhile. I will
be leaving tomorrow for Joplin, Mo. I will be taking
I-15 Down through Utah, then Onto Highway 89 at the
bottom of Utah, to I-40 in Arizona. From there I will
go across to Tulsa, Ok then I will take I-44 into
Joplin. So if anyone see's a truck pulling a u-hual
trailer with a brown/white westy give us a honk. I
will still be on the list just won't be able to check
for a few days.
Thanks,
Shawn Reed
78 westy 
79 bus
