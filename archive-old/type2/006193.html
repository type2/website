&gt;it, i also want to mount a relay for a duel battery kit there.
I wouldn't mount it there.  If it springs a leak, it would be spraying fuel
over a hot engine - very bad.  I mounted mine on the frame outside the
engine compartment and will go back to a nice, quiet, safe(r) mechanical
one very soon now.

&gt;I've converted 2 of our vehicles to electric. Used  cheap generics from
&gt;FLAPS, mounted them well UNDER the chassis (I've heard that, at least on
the
&gt;cheapies, they best push rather than pull the fuel), and have had very nice
&gt;service for probably 35K or so on them.
