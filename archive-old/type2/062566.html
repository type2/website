snip!

&gt; Anybody read
&gt;anything else by this Mr. Seume?
&gt;

mr. seume is the editor (i am pretty sure that is his title) of
&quot;Volksworld&quot; a VW magazine over in England. While the mag may have its
detractors, it is a far more tasteful publication than the bimbo rags
cranked out of cali.
