Subject: Vacuum leak?

Ok, 2.0L stock FI 1979 GE engine.

Has been running fine...no great. At some point, the engine no longer
sounded smooth. It used to purr, now it doesnt anymore. The idle is fairly
even as it was before. The engine has a vibration to it now, but not all
the time. You can notice it more at idle with the drivers door open, you
can see the door vibrate/shake.

My CHT isn't right. On a cool day (low 50's), my CHT will get up to 400F+.
Oil temp will climb to 220F. This is what I would normally see with
outside temps in the 80's, not 50's. CHT rises fairly quickly at
Interstate speeds, but once back at idle, the CHT comes back to 350F
pretty quickly.

I noticed my thermostat is expanded. I discovered this bus thermostat in
old stock at my auto parts store..paid $12 for it last summer. The flaps
are in the open position. I have verified this. I bought the last type 1
thermostat for $12 too, so at some point I'll put that in. I don't think
this is related.

My next thought, vacuum leak..running lean.  Now, the engine has plenty
of power. I have not noticed any performance degradation in the engine.
It's just the sound/feel and the temps. It could be I have a leak causing
a cylinder to miss, I dunno. So, I check the vacuum. It used to be 18&quot;
at idle (engine at temp). Now, it's 15&quot;-16&quot; at idle. When I rev the
engine at high rpm (3000+), the vacuum stabilizes at 19&quot;. This just
doesn't seem right. What do you guys think?
