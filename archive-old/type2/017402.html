Had nothing but good luck with my 1600 dual port from GEX- 60,000 trouble free miles so far in
the 71 type 2- maintained at 2500 mile intervals. This wasn't the cheapest rebuild available to
me here in So-Cal, more than twice the price of the (really) shady ones. I wonder if there are
others hiding with good experiences w/GEX or am I really that lucky? (I've heard of brand new
1600s off the showroom floor breaking down catastophically with low milage.) -bill
