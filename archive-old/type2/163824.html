Subject: Re: [T2] Rocker arm studs and me :-(

Well its all back together, I adjusted the valves and shes running.

I picked up a new stud from Northwest Connecting Rod on my way in to
work this morning.

I ended up replacing one of the pushrods (the one with the mangled
tip) and I think thats causing excessive noise.   Is this normal?

I opted not to use loctite to secure the stud since I figure if I
really needed to do it I could always take the stud back out. (there
was much descrepancy in the archives over red or blue)

All in all, it was a learning experience and I am glad that it wasn't
too costly.
