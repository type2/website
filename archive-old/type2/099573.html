Subject: Re: [T2] More starter problems

&gt;OK, I found the ground and attached it.  Now the
&gt;cylinoid clicks really hard but the starter motor
&gt;isn't doing anything.  When I try the screwdriver
&gt;method it clicks multiple times but the starter never
&gt;seems to engage and try to turn the engine.  Thinking
&gt;back, the starter worked when I pulled the engine but
&gt;the last two miles I was driving through the city with
&gt;the pilot bearing gone and had to start the bus in 1st
&gt;gear a couple of times before getting it home.  do I
&gt;have a blown starter motor?  I'm thinking I must of
&gt;killed it with those in gear starts.

You should be able to roll the engine over with a wrench to see if it is 
free. Do not have the ignition on of course.

I've had stuck starters to free up if I had the starter turned on with the 
key in the starter position and whacked it with a hammer at the same time.

Don't get run over!!! Tranny in neutral, E-brake on, helper with foot on 
brake pedal.

You may have a bad spot on the commutator.
