Subject: Whine questions

&quot;I searched the archives but still...etc...&quot;
Background:
68 bus with LOUD whine in 3rd and even louder in 4th. Whines only when in gear
w/ clutch engaged and louder when accelerating.
Trans and CVs were swapped and were quiet before in my other bus.
I saw other references to this but no solutions.

My guesses are leaning toward clutch, trans mount or rear bearings? 

Thanks Loads
