Subject: Re: DP to SP conversion

&gt; From: &quot;Karl&quot; &lt;aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;

&gt; In the USA, 71 buses were the last of the upright 1600's. 
&gt; They were SP.....

Au contraire, they were DP - at least my old 71 clipper was.  I thought
they all were.

FWIW, my current 71 westy has a rebuilt 1600 SP in it, but it's not
original.
