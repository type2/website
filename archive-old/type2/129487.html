Subject: Re: [T2] Airs Update

Hold the control key to select more than one entry in a category.  If
that doesn't work, what browser/version/os are you running?

It's a bit funky 'cuz I had to hack the script to use the multiple tag
on ALL selects, but it'll work.

Canadian provinces have been added.

It could be much prettier/easier to use without inordinately increasing
bandwidth.  If it flies, it WILL be much more elegant.
