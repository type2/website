When I got my '72 westy, the pop-top was covered with mold and crap.  I just
used normal pine cleaner like the stuff you dilute in a bucket and scrubbed
with a bristel brush like crazy, and now it looks nice.  I'd recommend after
you clean it that you put a couple of coats of armor-all on the whole top, it
helps to preserve the fiber-glass and protect it from cracking and sap and so
on.

This summer I need to clean the canvas, any cleaner tips for that?

&lt;&lt; Along with ideas on cleaning a bus, does anyone have ideas on cleaning the
 WESTFALIA top.  I just got a 72 and the fiberglass is dirty.  Will strong
 cleaners be a problem with the rubber seals?
 
 Thanks for all suggestions
