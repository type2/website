Subject: Re: [T2] where is the charging relay??


The relay in question should be located just inside the engine compartment
on the left side between the taillight assembly and the edge of the
compartment opening. At least that is where mine is and it looks stock...
As far as testing it you can use a volt meter or test light and see if you
have voltage at the proper connections when the engine is running and when
it is not. The wire which runs from your coil (+ side) to the relay should
show 12 volts only when the ignition is on. This activates, if you will,
the relay thereby completing the circuit between your auxiliary battery and
your main battery. If you look in the archives you can find a wiring
diagram for this relay or perhaps someone else on the list will send you a
copy.

hello again,

i understand that the auxilery battery is charged by
the alternator which joins both batteries while the
ignition is on, but seperates the aux from main
battery after the key has been turned of. now what i
am wondering is, where is this relay located, and how
can i tell if it &quot;relaying&quot; properly? i apologise for
all these questions which must seem pretty dumb to all
you vets out there. thanks in advance.
