Hi,

&gt; I've also used 195R14 reinforced on a
&gt; vanagon and it actually made the speedometer correct. 
&gt; (It was off with the 185's that the manuals say is
&gt; correct.)

 Bear in mind that the speedometer on a Bus (or a Porsche for
that matter) isn't supposed to be &quot;correct&quot;.

 Regulations in the UK, and other European countries, I believe
(though I don't know about the USA) state that a vehicle speedo
must read within -0 and +10% of the road speed. It's a given,
therefore, that a speedo that's within manufacturers spec will
read high, probably by about 5% or so depending on how much
they've allowed for pressure variation, tread wear etc.

 The 195s are nominally about 2-3% bigger than the 185s, so 
closer to the &quot;correct&quot; reading.

Cheers,
	 W.
