&gt;         Now, for what I do have experience with.  My first two uprights
&gt; burned valves.  They both had the Sng Vac Adv dizzy.  It was a really
&gt; strange deal as both of them burnt the electrode clean off of the plug on
&gt; the cylinder.  It makes a real distinct SMELL!  There are LOTS of folks out
&gt; there, too, that know this smell, unfortunately.  I have had several others
&gt; folks email me with similar stories (ie burning heads quick until dizzy
&gt; replacement).
&gt;

Maybe that's it.... I was looking at where the vacuum hose went to from the
dizzy, and it goes to the throttle valve body.  So this means that the vacuum
(and therefore the advance) changes depending on how much I have my foot in
it?, or just as important,  it retards when I take my foot off the gas and
prevents the burned valves??

I dunno exactly, but somehow that sounds right in my head. - can anybody
verify this.....

&gt;
&gt;         Experience also says, shifting is not quite as smooth with the 009
&gt; but negligable considering the performance/longevity issues.

hmm, I've been sucessfully talked out of the 009. I'll probably keep the 009
for emergencies, and try and fix my normal dizzy.

-one more project for the list..

Thanks.
