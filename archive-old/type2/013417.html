Hmm... scrathcing my head...

I figure I have a good six grand into my bus so far. 
Like Missy, I was given the bus (my brother, its all
his fault!).  I have a new and failing GEX hydraulic
1.8 w/ 37K on the clock, Miller CIS fuel injection,
new Cooper LT195/75R14 tires, a completely new brake
system front to back, German Transaxle rebuilt tranny
(yet another learning experience, its crap... gotta
replace it soon), JVC &amp; Pioneer stereo system,
replacement interior from another 73' Westy(thanks
Scott Solomon!), Honda CRX SI front seats, new
Wolfsburg West bumpers (powder coated sky white) --
currently working on the replacment fiberglass top,
just about ready to paint it.  Last but not least
complete curtain set lovinly sewn by my mom (way cool
jungle print).

Labors of love indeed!  Any sane person would and
often does grin, shake their head and walk away
wondering what posessed me to take to converting a
former &quot;planter&quot; into viable transportation.  Funny
thing is I can't imagine not driving this bus of mine
:-)

Heres to all the rest of us hard bitten bus drivers!

Brian, rambling around in Salem Oregon
