Im sure its the Agilis 61s, I just got off the phone with Michelin and they 
said a boatload of them are heading for the states and we should see them 
showing up at our favorite suppliers soon.

&gt;The arbitrator for Discount Tire did not specify a name for the tire (new
&gt;tire in Michlein line, there are none in the US at this time) but said it
&gt;was the right diameter and in every way was an 60,000 mile warranty tire
&gt;for the Westfalia.
&gt;The tires are in Europe and it will take about two weeks before they are
&gt;warehoused and distributed in the US to dealers.
