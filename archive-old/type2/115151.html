&gt;I wonder why Bentley even specs the pressure without the vacuum hose

&gt;
&gt;Seems to me that the way the system works is that a constant pressure
&gt;differential must be maintained across the injectors over the span of
&gt;operating conditions. Under varying conditions, the vacuum hose is
&gt;responsible for establishing this differential.

The pressure without vac hose connected sets the upper design value of the 
constant differential.  36 psi is the upper limit that can be accommodated 
by any combination of other system air/fuel determining components. Also, 
higher values can cause injector leakage and put extra stress on the cold 
start valve and fuel rail hoses.

&gt;
&gt;With this logic, if one has 28 psi with the engine running and the
&gt;vacuum hose connected, then the system is ok. Of course, one should
&gt;check to be sure that 28 is maintained under load. How? I don't know.

28 psi measured on the fuel rail will not be maintained but the differential 
will be.  The pressure regulator is refered to air manifold vacuum. As the 
vacuum is reduced the fuel pressure is increased.
The conversion factor from psi to in.Hg  (vacuum) is 2.06. If the vacuum is  
20.06 in.Hg. and the  unconnected fuel pressure is 38 psi the connected fuel 
rail pressure would be 28 psi. At open throttle ( zero vacuum) the fuel rail 
pressure would measure 38 psi.

&gt;I'm thinking about it.
&gt;
&gt;I hope someone with more knowledge than I have comments on this.

Hope this helps.
