Subject: compression w/engine running

Hi Mike,
Actually this is a common diagnostic procedure.  By checking the compression
with the engine running you can detect sticky valves or similar problems
that might not be obvious at the slower cranking RPM's.  Typically you
should expect about 30-50% lower readings than at cranking test.
