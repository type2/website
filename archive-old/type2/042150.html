Subject: RE: Awful knocking noise from rear axle....Help appreciated

In just rebuilt my two drive shaft this weekend.  It was a matter of taking
my two shafts and two from my parts bus and disassembling them all, cleaning
them and making two good shafts from the four bad ones.  It took all day
long to clean and rebuild them (5 hours) but I am a little AR.  Anyway, I
got the new boots (which come with grease) and they work beautifully now.
The PO of the parts bus used wheel bearing grease for th CVs and they had a
lot of premature wear.  BE SURE TO USE THE CV GREASE EXCLUSIVLY!  Also, when
you reassemble the joints, be sure to make sure they more around correctly.
You can actually assemble them so they are completely locked.  The Bently
shows the correct way to reassemble them but it took me a few times to find
the sweet spot where they will rotate freely in all directions.  Make sure
the bearing balls are completely smooth.  If you drop one and it gets a nic
in it, simply sand it at the rough spot with 600 grit sandpaper.  This can
also fix rough spots in the seats.  Be sensible though.  If it looks really
bad (pitted, etc.), replace them.  It is a lot of labor so better to get it
right the first time.  If your shocks are bad, it is a good time to replace
them as well since I removed them anyway for easier access to the shafts.
Funny, my new boots did not come with any clamps for the small end of the
boot.  Am I supposed to supply my own or do you no longer need a clamp?
BTW, today is the first day I used my bus to commute!  She is finally
reliable!  Only thing left to do is fix my fuel guage.  Is it possible that
I just have a short in the wiring?  It is usually the sender?  Sorry about
the long post.

Justin

Nicholas,
If its not the nut on the stub axle, that Rod suggests and which btw needs 
to be torqued to 250 ft-lbs!, then it has to be one of the two CV joints on 
that half axle. You may find that the rubber boot covers that Mike suggests 
are o.k., in which case you may just be low on grease in the cv joints. This

moly-based grease has a tendency over time to slowly leak out of the joint 
flange and ultimately the joint runs dry enough to bind up. If you get to it

quickly with an application of grease you can save the joint.
If that is the case, just remove the six socket head bolts in each flange, 
after cleaning the outside of the flanges so as not to get dirt in the 
joint, pull back the flange, and apply a few oz. of cv-joint or moly-based 
chassis grease to the joint (if done sequentially, you don't actually remove

the entire half-shaft)  Then replace and torque the bolts to 25 ft.lbs, 
using new lock washers. I've also read of using a needle-type grease 
injector on a grease gun to inject grease between the shaft and the collar 
at the small end of the boot, but haven't tried this yet.
Awful knocking is the sound of a sticking cv-joint that is hollering for 
grease!
