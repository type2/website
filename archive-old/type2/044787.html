 think?

Hi,

1974 California certified with automatic trans was an 1800 fuel injected
engine.  The shop manuals, and a current post list the engine # prefix to
displacement if it is not converted to a 2.0 in the 1800 case.  In any event,
test run it on the floor before you buy.  Email me and I'll tell you how I do
that.

Keep smiling,

Mike

&gt;  The person selling it says it's a 1800 but it's fuel injected so
&gt; it's most likely a 2 liter isn't it?  It's complete with all accessories and
&gt; the fuel injection components, harness, computer, etc.
