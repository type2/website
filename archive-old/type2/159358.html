Subject: Re: [T2] cross your fingers

I guess the car I really miss was the 1930 Austin 7 that I had as an  
undergraduate in England. I bought it for 5 pounds and sold it for 25.
The 62 Kombi that I had in LA still has fond memories, even though could  not 
do 55 into a headwind on I5 when coming back from camping trips in the  
Sierras.
