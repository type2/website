Subject: Re: [T2] Shifter Bushings?



A little while back someone had posted that they were going to attempt to
replace all the shifter bushings in their bay without removing the tranny.
I'm curious how this procedure went, if it was do-able at all.

I did it a couple of years ago on my '71 Westy.  As I recall, it involved
taking apart the shifter rod and sliding it past itself. A tight squeeze,
but doable. Much easier than removing the tranny. Check your square cage
just in front of the tranny while you are at it, it is also replaceable
without pulling tranny.
