Subject: Pulling fan on '78 Westy

    I'm still working on rebuilding my 2.0L for my '78 Westy, removed
the three bolts near the center of the fan (I'm not even working on
getting the fan HUB off yet), and try as I might, even though all the
books say it comes right off, the dang thing won't budge. Any ideas on
1) why it's stuck contrary to popular opinion and 2) how to remove it?
