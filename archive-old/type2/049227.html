Subject: RE: [T2] Gas heater question

I think that if that breaker goes it means that the heater has nor
re-ignited for a certain period of time while fuel is flowing (safety
feature to prevent explosion or backfire). Mine would backfire if I reset
the switch without letting the heater purge the fumes first. I don't know
why yours wouldn't reignite after a half hour of continuous operation. Mine
would start, but then not re-light because the spark part of the glow plug
was no good.

I believe these heaters were built for the North, they seem to be standard
equipment on Canadian Buses. Mine is absolutely necessary up here in
Saskatoon, even though temps are not bad here now (around -15C overnight),
its going to get a workout when temps hit -35C.

&gt; 
&gt; Volks: My 76 bus has the standard gas heater under the middle of the bus.
&gt; It works fine, but about every half hour or so it trips out, an I need to 
&gt; reach up under the dash to the left of the steering column, and click the
&gt; little red 
&gt; lever sticking out of the bottom of a little 2&quot;x2&quot;x2.5&quot; black box. It will
&gt; then run for about an other 1/2 hour
&gt; and trip out again, and so on. Any ideas what is wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; Note that the heater exhaust pipe has been rusting away, and now has some
&gt; holes near the 
&gt; heater end if this makes any difference.
&gt; 
&gt; Other than that it works fine, although if you turn it up to max temp, it
&gt; will cook you out of the bus 
&gt; pretty quick. The thing seems like way overkill for temperatures down to
&gt; about -25F. Maybe its 
&gt; sized for the North?
