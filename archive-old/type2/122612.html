Subject: Re: [T2] headlight switches

on 3/17/04 11:26, Tom and Thanh related:

&gt; I wonder is this switch really made in the US, or some old stock from Europe
&gt; or something?

i might be mistaken, but it looked to me like there was a logo molded into
the black plastic of the switch, looked like it was a &quot;V&quot;. for ventura?

i will know more soon, as i have inquired about becoming a dealer for their
parts.
