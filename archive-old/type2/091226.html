sounds like you have a wiring problem to the front of the bus.  Everything
was fine until you put a headlight load on the wiring.  Check the battery
now.  If it is around 12V it is not dead, just not connected to the
starter by the wiring.

First think I would do is wiggle all the fuses.  After that, get out the
wiring diagram and start tracing the hot wire to make sure it is hot from
the battery, through the switch, to the starter.
