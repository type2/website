Subject: lotsa smoke&lt;problem&gt;

As it was my Bday yesterday I took the day off an went
down to watch an learn as my engine was pulled apart.
listed below are the symptoms.
-----------------------------
Blowing lotsa smoke... came on pretty quickly with no
nasty noises. The Tailpipe is wet with oil.
Those are the symptoms. I will pass on the diagnosis
as soon as I get... I get to go down and help some as
time permits... good learning experience.
---------

Found: 2 dropped guides. one was down and a little
loose the other was dropped as far as it would go and
was being flared by the valve. It was starting to
crack so I am glad I parked it as soon as it started
to smoke. It was on the verge of breaking and making
a large mess of the whole engine.
  Once the muffler was off it was obvious which side
had the problem due to the oil in the pipe.
  Sleeves were in good shape but the rings are worn
and the oil rings were pretty much plugged. 
Decided to re-sleeve (Jugs &amp; Pistons) along with valve
job. Amazing how easy it is to work on a type4 once it
is out of the cave and up on a stand! Also a good time
to install a new push rod for the mech. fuel pump to
insure it isn't being short stroked..
  Moral: If das bus takes up smoken all of a sudden.
STOP driven it and check it out.
--------------------------
type3 engine completly rebuilt. Plug and drive.. as it
has everything on it._dot_carbs... etc etc. $500.oo.
  If you are in the SEATTLE area look up Friedel's in
RENTON, Wa. in the yellow pages if interested.
