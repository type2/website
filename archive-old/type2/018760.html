Subject: foolproof brake adjusting star guideline
Message-ID: &lt;3789061A.48C2_at_ibm_dot_net&gt;

I take a spare adjusting star and screw with me under the bus.  Then I
place it next to the backing plate in the same direction as the star and
adjusting screw I am getting ready to adjust.  I rotate the star and
determine wether I should rotate up or down based on wether the screw
goes in or out.
Makes it a lot easier for me
good luck

YOU WROTE:
This thread reminded me of an ongoing question I've always had regarding
the rear brake adjusting stars:  Does anybody have a foolproof guideline
for determining which way to turn the right/left stars each time?  
Each time I do it I seem to always have it backwards.  Muir attempts
this
but I find the description confusing.   Thanks in advance for any tips
you
can give...
