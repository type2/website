Subject: Puff 'O Smoke

Greetings all -

I was racing a semi up a hill on my way home last night, doing maybe
3600rpm, full throttle. I think I had just gone over a hump in the road when
I noticed a two-second puff of smoke coming from my tailpipe. Then it
stopped smoking. Power was good throughout the puff.

I'm running a 1915 with a re-jetted 34-PICT-3 that normally runs great, if
not a taste rich - I can see a slight puff when I power-shift from 3rd to
4th now and then.

Was this an overflow condition in the float bowl?

Thanks -
