&gt;I have a ton of old auto magazines I am about to put up on E Bay and as I
&gt;was going through them I found this old manual.
&gt;
&gt;It was published in 1958 and features only the beetle and ghia models in
&gt;it's pages.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone know anything about this old gem?

Never knew that Elfrink wrote a manual for VW, but he is well known umongst
the Porshe crowd for his 356 manual. I have it and it is relatively
speaking, very thorough, accurate and concise, and still being printed due
to consistant demand.
