To Steven Dolan,

With all due respect, and if possible with the bandwidth use, maybe this is a thread that 
should be free to continue in the interest of every members of the list. 

I personally find it very interesting to know the &quot;status&quot; of most members of the list 
and most important to get a portrait of those &quot;bizarre peoples&quot; that are owners of old 
&quot;machinae&quot; and that thrive to keep them on the road whatever. It is securing to know, 
for me at least,  that others without real mechanical knowledge are able to fulfill this 
&quot;mission&quot;.

By the way, I am currently, a retiree.

Formerly manager in some government agencies (labour, welfare...)
