&quot;mmmmm....do-nuts&quot;

        - also by H. Simpson

Does anyone remember when Homer made a pact with the devil (played by Ned
Flanders) and his head turned into a giant pink frosted donut? &quot;Bart! stop
picking at your father's head.&quot;

On a personal note, I like the little powdered ones that come in the big
plastic bag. (You'll probably read this on Friday :) )

Donuts.... Is there *anything* they can't do?

So Jeff Carver says:
&gt; Glad to someone else eats a 'Power Breakfast'.
&gt; Donuts &amp; milk, now, that's my idea of a REAL breakfast.
&gt; 
&gt; An so Bob reports in his Inuvik Trip Log:
&gt; &gt; After waiting for about an hour I wandered over to the grocery
&gt; &gt; store for a belated breakfast of donuts and milk.
