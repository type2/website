&gt;Where would you like to be able to drive your favorite VW if given the time,
&gt;health, and a modest budget. Who would you take along and why? What vehicle
&gt;would you take?

  Oh, let's see... From the heartland here (KCMO) I'd drop south to NOLA and
enjoy some true Cajun food and music,  then west to San Antonio for some
TexMex food and music,  Then west to NM and see if John Muir's wife is still
there and could tell me any interesting stories,, then west to So.Cal. and
visit with Bob Hoover maybe make him an offer on Grendel???  then north to
San Fran area, for Sourdough and wine, maybe see if Lois is around and
willing to sell Vernon yet, then north to the Wolfsburg Warehouse, some
coffee houses and grunge music (do they still play that up there)
