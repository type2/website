Subject: hot wheel No. 2

This message didn't get through somehow, so here's a condensed version.
Sorry if it eventually repeats:

I recently did a brake job on the rear wheels of the 70 Westy and now one of
them gets very hot after driving short distances. The shoes are not
dragging -- I backed them off all the way and the wheel rotates freely when
jacked up. There is a tiny bit of play in the bearing, again as determined
by wiggling the wheel while jacked up, but no&quot;ballsy rumbling sound&quot; as Muir
describes a bad bearing. Any guesses as to what might be causing this wheel
to get hot?

One additional bit of info: I blew a tire on this wheel while towing the bus
last summer. By the time I got pulled over the wheel was smoking hot, and
the tire was completely shredded.

Could a bearing seize up and cause the wheel to stop turning, then magically
free itself when the wheel cools down? I'm really at a loss here.
Thanks
Bob
