Subject: help with westy sink and pump installation needed
Message-Id: &lt;199903310050.QAA01434_at_coopext_dot_cahe.wsu_dot_edu&gt;

hi , not sure if this is correct way to ask a question... but here goes....
I found a sink cabinet that someone had tosssed-- still with sink, and
pump, water tank (dirty0, and ice box (also dirty) in it.  I want to remove
the water pump near sink and install it in my 70 westy.  But am not sure
what else I need to hook up-- i saw several pipes near by.  Also, any idea
of best way of cleaning the tank... not sure what's been in it.
thanks!
