This past weekend here in our neck of the lovely pacific northwest (oregon, generally, portland specifically) saw some bitingly cooooooold weather.  My poor
pack mule gretel seems to have suffered from it, as of this morning.  I took her
out on the sanded (salt is for your potatoes! who eats roads??) streets and 
discovered to my dismay that my brake pedal easily depressed almost to the floor
before catching the e-brake cable and engaging the e-brake.  This gave me 
stopping power, but I don't consider it very safe stopping power, so I put her
back in the driveway and got a ride to work.  A co-worker suggested that 
perhaps I had some water in my brake lines (is this a likely thing?) and that
the cold weather had frozen it, forcing the brake lines to bust like water 
pipes. 

:(

Any suggestions for troubleshooting this problem will be appreciated.  I 
haven't had time to consult with my books (muir bentley haynes) yet so I have
no idea as to the scale of my problem.  

Thanks for your support!
