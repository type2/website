&gt;I believe the measurement from the top of the piston to the center of the
&gt;wrist pin hole is different. Because of the difference in the length of the
&gt;con rods...

I don't know about that measurement, but I do know that the 2000 pistons 
will not work with the 1.7/1.8 rods because the bump on top of the rods 
will hit the bottom of the piston (2-liter rods do not have this bump).  I 
suppose you could grind the bump off and use them though.  I would try this 
in a pinch.
