Subject: '78 exhaust manifolds &amp;/or part # needed
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.5.32.19990623190723.009d0210_at_mail.bhm.bellsouth_dot_net&gt;

Hello All:
A non-list member friend of mine is looking for the
exhaust manifold tubes for his '78. I called them J-tubes.
The tubes that connect the heads to the heat exchangers.
actually 4 pieces, altho mine were inseparable...
I told him to contact BusDepot, he did and they said if
he could provide a part # they *might* could get them.

So, does anyone happen to know the part # ?
I plan to crawl under my bus and try to locate it, but
thought someone might have a reference handy or spare 
sitting around they could take a look at for the #'s.

or anyone have a good used set they would part with ?
reply to me &amp;/or:
&lt;lancereed_at_empiresolutions_dot_com&gt;

thanks!
Rob
'79 westy ('78 engine and '77 exhaust :)
