&gt; BTW, Richard, I passed Cupertino twice this week - I drove the Westy
&gt; from Santa barbara to a meeting in Davis, and, as always, was shocked
&gt; by the lack of type 2's on the highway.

I once saw the Maytag repairman driving his bus down the highway. He  
looked pretty lonely. :-)

&gt; On the entire 780-mile round trip, I saw *no* type 2's on the freeway
&gt; (briefly glimpsed one on surface streets when I was gettingn gas), and
&gt; only one Vanagon.

I have a similar experience wherever I drive but if you head over the  
hill to Santa Cruz you'll find where all the VWs have gone.

&gt; Where are they all going?? (rhetorical question - I think I already
&gt; know the answer, unfortunately...)

Judging by the back streets, rotting in driveways. A knock on the  
door to ask if they want to sell? It's hard to part a VW owner from  
his VW not matter how much it doesn't run anymore.
