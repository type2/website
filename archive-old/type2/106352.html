Subject: Re: [T2] oil leak / cracked case

Hello All     90 percent of the time you can see the cracks with the naked 
eye. The most common places for cracks are on the top of the case on the oil 
cooler side and behind the flywheel on the same side.Also there is a dye that 
you can use to help see cracks. The formula vee guys use this stuff to check 
the front spindles.I think it can be found at any flaps or check machine 
shops. later and have fun  Mark dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va
