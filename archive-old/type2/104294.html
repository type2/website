&gt; I worked for once. It was a shaft with a handle that you pushed for
&gt; brakes and rotated for acceleration.

that is one of the basic designs, I have a different system in my van
&gt; 
&gt; But you could do both at the same time!

mine also, good for rough roads and conditions
&gt; 
&gt; I almost plowed that thing into the back of a semi when I forgot and
&gt; reversed upon freezing.

takes some getting used to, mine is parallel to the steering wheel for gas
and parallel to the steering column for brake.  pull towards you to go,
push to the floor to stop.
