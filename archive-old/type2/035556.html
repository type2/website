&gt; &gt;I will be getting out the Muir book (and looking at the 'Rituals' chapter)
&gt; &gt;today to see if I can exorcise the demons from the hubcap before I send it
&gt; &gt;on it's way.   I saw aprocedure posted a couple of weeks ago about using
&gt; &gt;candles and drawing a VW emblem with salt on the garage floor to remove a
&gt; &gt;persistant gland nut.  Will this procedure also remove demons from a
&gt; &gt;hubcap??  The _LAST_ thing I want to do is pass the 'bad moe-joe' along.

I dont know what you guys did to that thing but it brought me nothing but
luck for 600+ miles.
