Subject: Re: [T2] Points dilemma (broken rubbing block)

Back in ,95 on an otherwise uneventful 10,000 mi trip we were near 
Saguaro Cactus National Monument, New Mexico, when 78 bus kept stalling 
at lights and went with poor power- turns out the points rubbing block 
had split in half- and timing (which I checked first) had retarded like 
14 degr! Brazilian Bosch points!  Ever try to change points when the air 
temp is 100 deg and the distributor si _at_)(#(*^)(*^% hot?  We visited the 
cacti while waiting for it to cool.....

  hey guys  we saw this a bunch with the bosch points that had the white
  rubbing block . 01 011 part number  I have been using the bosch points 
01  030 that
  have the brown rubbing block and the black and white lead wire. these 
  points
  have a stronger spring also. For what it is worth these are the points 
of
  choice for the formula vee racers as there isn't anything worse than not
  finishing a race caused by cheap points or anything else cheap for 
that matter
  breaking  .These same guys will rev their motors up to 6800 rpm when 
running wide
  open down the straight .  later  mark  d
