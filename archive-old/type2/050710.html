Subject: Re: [T2] Best spark plugs?

Oh, I did!  It just took me a while to find it..

&gt; &gt;In my experience Bosch plugs don't like to work after they've been fouled
&gt; &gt;and cleaned.  A bad carburetor put my rich running bus through like 5
sets
&gt; &gt;of Bosch plugs.  I kept asking my FLAPS for some NKG plugs but they
insisted
&gt; &gt;on Bosch.  So they'd get fouled, stop firing, I'd clean them, and they
never
&gt; &gt;seemed to come back.  I dunno..
&gt;
&gt; How about resolving the problem, not the plugs, the over rich mixture??
