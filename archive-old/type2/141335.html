Subject: Re: [T2] Cam question(Hyd/solid)

Hi Adam,

    I don't think anyone is advocating that he mix cams and lifters. Just
passing along the facts in answer to his question! So he may make a decision
based on fact.
    And the fact is that they will work mixed, just not without damage, as
stated!


Cheers,

Howard

&gt; You can't mix/match lifters and cams.  Some folks will say  they have done
&gt; it.  Those are the same folks that are always pulling their motors to fix
&gt; them each month.
&gt;
&gt; Stick with solids.  Then you know what you got.
