&gt;The only other major new items that I replaced were all the mechanical

I doubt that any of this is causing your bus to run poorly.  There *may* be other issues that come up in the future if the parts don't play well together, but if the valves are opening and closing when they should, this is not the source of your current problem.  For the rest of the list: There is nothing wrong with making your own pushrods - it is done all the time.  One of those &quot;not rocket science&quot; things.

&gt;Once the lifters were pumped up I adjusted the valves to 1.5 turns in
&gt;from 0 clearance and this seemed to prevent it from starting.  When I
&gt;adjust the valves at .006 in the engines starts and will run as long as
&gt;my foot is on the gas.

Leave the lifters at .006&quot; until you get the engine running well.  It won't hurt anything.  I have never owned a FI bus so I can't really help you with troubleshooting the electronics, but have you checked your vacuum reading?  That may give you a clue.  It sounds like you might have a large vacuum leak.

&gt;What are the most common variables to suspect when &quot;tunning&quot; an engine
&gt;which has not run in a while.  Do I just need to break it in by letting
&gt;it run for half an hour? 

In your case, no.  Valvetrains are ready to go immediately.  The only thing that would need breaking in would be rings.  If the engine doesn't settle down to a nice idle within a minute or two of starting, then you made a mistake somewhere during assembly, or you have a failed part.  Find the mistake or the failed part.
