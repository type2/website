Subject: True Canadian Winter Bus Campout

Hi Volks,

My bus is cold and lonely. I miss camping season, and it does too.

EveryBus is great, but I just can't wait until April, and Florida is 
too far for a weekend trip.

There's only one thing left to do:

Email me offlist if you wanna come with us or if you need more info 
than what's on the page.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
