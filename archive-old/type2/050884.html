Said Scott Solomon:

&gt; Today at lunch I drove by an old 70 Westy that had been sitting for a long
&gt; time. In fact almost two years ago I pulled the pop-top off for my 70
&gt; standard. Anyway, I went out and looked it over and found that the whole
&gt; interior, while still there, was totally shot.

Go figure!  Only two years with a big hole in the roof and all that wood 
is rotten?  Makes you want to strangle the guy who pulled the top off 
and just left it exposed ... oops.
