Subject: Re: [T2] Fitting


From: &quot;David Bell&quot; &lt;bellky_at_charter_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Evening, all. After having no luck in the archives I turn to the list for
&gt; information. I have a
&gt; 74/T4-1800/manual. On the left side of the fan housing near the top is a
&gt; tubular fitting sticking out about 3/4&quot;. It points to the left, is smooth
&gt; and maybe 5/8 diameter. Any idea what this is? Where it goes, what it does?

What is the engine # stamped in the housing just to the right of the coil? I
am betting it starts with GD.......
That fitting is for one of the two hoses that goes to the charcoal cannister.
Usually it is only there on 76 and up 2.0L buses because the cannister on them
mount on the gas tank panel between the double relay and the decel valve. On
earlier buses, the cannister mounted above the battery on the right side.
If it does start with GD, someone put a 76/77 fan housing on your 74....
