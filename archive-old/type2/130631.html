Subject: Re: [T2] Gene Berg Dipstick on type4 engine?

I think the dipstick senders are worthwhile - very cheap insurance. 
They are as accurate as any other automotive temp gauge (and way
easier to install).  Just be sure to test it in boiling water every
once in a while to make sure its calibrated.  I had one that was not
even close to turning the light on _at_ 227 F.

You should definitely get an oil pressure gauge.  Then you can
dedicate the oil light to the dipstick sender.

As for the light coming on often and being a source of worry - bottom
line is when the light comes on you are near 227 F (assuming you
calibrate).  You decide what action to take.  I usually slow down,
which sometimes means grabbing 3rd and driving slower.  I have found
if I operate the bus within the limits it was designed for and not
drive it like its a Honda, the light never comes on.

The thing I DONT like about the dipstick sender - it sucks for
checking oil.  I keep the original dipstick in the engine compartment
and still use it for checking oil.
