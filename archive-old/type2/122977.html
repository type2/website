Subject: Re: [T2] fire talk

In an effort to make my '72 a little bit safer I went to the plumbing
section at my local hardware store and came up with this setup:
http://www.geocities_dot_com/vwcamper72/FuelLineGrommet.html.  It leaves a nice
smooth pass-thru for the fuel line and is most likely a bit more on the
heavy duty side than lamp hardware.  Total cost was about $5.00.  Not a bad
price for one less thing to worry about...

Hope this helps.
