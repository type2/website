&gt; George, how about us folks who aren't worried about all this power,lthat

&gt; certainly want to enjoy the ride and not just get there and start HAVING
&gt; FUN,FUN,FUN! You know, &quot;hurry Up And Wait? I try to respect most people
&gt; that I meet, but have little patience with those around us who can't
&gt; &quot;spare the time to live&quot;.....

I think that you misread my post!  I'm the guy who's happy with a
bone-stock 1600dp!  I talked about the theory of why you might want to rev
beyond the power peak, but this is no indication that you will want to do
so or that I recommend that you do so.  Drive your bus as you please!
