never done this, but heres an idea....

shut the door, and remove the hardboard panel that hides the innards of
the door...

use a tool with a drill bit to drill through the door and post with the
door _shut_

dunno if a regular drill will fit inside the door to drill this hole, but
i bet a dremel tool would.

drilling the hole with the door shut gurantees the holes will line up, and
saves you from removing the door.

as i said, i have no idea if this would work (or if there is even enough
room between the door and the front post to keep the wire from being
pinched badly.)

but it is an idea....

peas,

Steve
