Subject: 73 Exhaust

So, my last junkyard journey
yielded a few interesting finds.

I got the bits to fix my window.
I also got the worst breakout of poison oak
I've had for about 9 or 10 years.

I also found a bus that had nearly perfect heater
boxes and aux. blower motor.  Now, my 77 has no heater
boxes at all.

Do I buy them, bolt them up to my 77 and rig up something
for the control flaps? Or do I buy them and sell them to
some soul who needs them for a 73?  Either way, I should
buy them so someone uses them.
 
The junked bus also had perfect sliding door hardware.  As soon
as my legs heal, I'm going back  ( this time with pants) and making
the big score.  I'm probably going to keep the door parts since
mine is really bad, but if anyone has a nice bus they are missing
some stuff for, like the heater boxes or fan, let me know.  Having heat
isn't going to make my van less of a basket case and I almost feel like
using them would be a waste if someone else has a really sweet unit they
need
to get rolling again :)



 
On another note, I think I found out why my bus was missing
and dying. I rolled under it after a particularly dead session
and noticed that the fuel filter looks to be almost totally full
of water.  Assuming my fuel supply is good, where might the point
of entry be? Filler neck? Condensation? General bad chi?


take care all
