Subject: Re: [T2] What would YOU do?

Hi Mark,

With all the 009 bashing that goes on I thought I would be terribly
dissatisfied with mine which came on the bus I bought about a year ago. I'm
not. It purrs softly and beautifully at low idle, about 800 rpm, never
stalls and is good at MOST acceleration tasks. The only time I miss vacuum
advance is occasionally on acceleration from a dead stop -- I get an
occasional hesitation which I've learned when it occurs to partially
overcome by a soft, judicious push on the accelerator.

Other than that, I suspect I would get better mileage with vacuum, which
when I find a good clean dizzy I will one day install. But will the owner be
happy? Unless she is planning to drag race her bug I see no problem provided
you tune the carb/dizzy well.

&gt; Here's the scenario:
&gt;
&gt; In rebuilding an engine (someone else's), I've come across a classic
&gt; distributor dilemma.
&gt;
&gt; Hers is a '71 dual vacuum, like the one in my bus. (I like them -- in
fact,
&gt; I pulled the new 009 off mine and installed a stock one, worn and decrepit
&gt; but with &quot;triple fast action&quot; for the stock carb lover.)
&gt;
&gt; So I go to clean off her diz and replace the electricals tonight and two
&gt; things jump right out:
&gt;
&gt; 1) The vacuum advance doesn't work. Air leakage somewhere. Retard works.
&gt;
&gt; 2) The cam is really worn ... shaft is tight, though.
&gt;
&gt; I can't, in good conscience and good business, put the old half-dead
&gt; distributor back on this pretty new engine. It needs at least a vacuum can
&gt; (maybe the nipple needs rebrazing? Anyway, vacuum leak no good). All I
have
&gt; to replace it with is a 009. Having established that I wouldn't put one on
&gt; my bus, this is not my bus, in fact it's a bug and hey, the 009 is
&gt; practically new. By the way it's a stock carb.
&gt;
&gt; I do want her to be happy with this engine. With the 009 I worry about
being
&gt; able to dial in a low enough idle. What would you do?
