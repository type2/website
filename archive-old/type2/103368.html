Subject: Re: [T2] Wood interior for the Westy

&gt;Not sure you can do anything to it. It is laminate. You would need to 
&gt;remove the laminate and get down to the
&gt;real wood. But then you have plywood....
&gt;Replacing the laminate is the only real fix....

That $53 per 4x8 sheet of laminate this morning in Middle TN, I checked. 
Your area's prices may vary... &lt;grin&gt;

That my next project. Now - just got to find the best way to remove the old 
laminate as it is broken and lifting in several places.

www.outwater_dot_com  is one location that carries the plastic/rubber/nylon 
edging in 29 of your favorite colors.
