Hi Volks

Tom Sackett sed:
&gt; Normally, the bus engine has a slightly different crankcase,
&gt;with a few extra drillings to allow the hanger to bolt on. However, in
&gt;my bus only the ends of the hanger are left. In between them is welded
&gt;some home-grown metal work that appears to grab the engine somewhere
&gt;behind the main pulley.
&gt;&gt;Has anyone ever heard of this modification before? I don't think it's
&gt;given me any problems, but it seems that the engineers at VW would have
&gt;used a bug engine if they could in the first place.
&gt;
I came across a bus with this mod just last week. The rear crossmember had
a little tab welded between it and the oil pump coverplate. This seemed to
do the job OK, but I wouldn't recommend it except in an emergency.
