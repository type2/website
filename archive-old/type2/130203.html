Subject: I'm getting the busloops

Dang, I am coming down with the busloops.

I was hoping that having gone into remission from my previous case of 
the busloops, I might have developed some immunity.

It's Don Tuleja's fault. All that constant pondering and cogitating! 
Maybe I'll do this, maybe I'll do that. That's the busloops.

The last three days I was thinking, in no particular order,

1. Maybe I should take my poptop off and put a flat platform on top of 
my bus. I can access it through the center hatch. I could use the 
platform for photography, getting a good view, and pitching a tent. 
Should I build a torsion box and fiberglass it? That would make it 
strong, lightweight, and waterproof.

2. Should I build my own engine, get an AVP and start building another 
engine; or say the hell with it, go with an engine from Boston Bob, and 
just not worry about an engine again for the next five years.*

3. I'm too old for this stuff. Maybe I should just buy a Eurovan 
conversion and be done with it for a while.

4. Welding: I downloaded a bunch of pictures from the Samba of a repair 
in the rear corner, right where I want to do mine. I haven't touched a 
welding torch in 15 years, but I'm going to have to do it someday.

5. Upholstery. I've been threatening to reupholstery the seats and bed 
in material cut from Pendleton Indian blankets. And curtains too. Still 
$160 a blanket.

6. Modular. That's the way to go with the cabinets. Make them modular 
so that I can stack and reconfigure the camper per specific need. And 
wouldn't it be cool if ...

7. But, as I said yesterday, an SO-23 is the most elegant Westy 
interior. But it's not practical for anything except, maybe, a picnic 
for two on a rainy day. Well, I've always wanted to go to Oregon, so 
that may not be so impractical. Maybe two interiors, with quick 
connect-and-disconnect fasteners.

8. Or two buses. That might be easier.

9. Of course, if I were to have two buses, the second bus really ought 
to be a single cab. Maybe I'll ask the list to confirm the theory that 
AC works well in a single cab because there's not as much space to 
cool.

10. But then again ...

Like I said, the busloops. And the only cure I know of is to do about 
half of this stuff, decide that my life has gotten out of control, and 
give up for a few years.

*This had been all decided. The plan was to ship my engine case to 
Boston Bob for an align bore, and to ship eveything that moves to Jake 
Raby for a dynamic balance. That has been the plan for months. But then 
Bob told me to ship the case in a rubbermaid container stuffed with 
cardboard. Whenever I don't like something, I procrastinate endlessly 
in dealing with it. I didn't like the rubbermaid container stuffed with 
cardboard. So on Saturday, I started building a wooden crate to ship 
the case. And as I was starting to cut corners a little, mostly to save 
weight, I started to think how Bob would react to the crate. &quot;Wow, what 
a crappy crate,&quot; I imagined him thinking. So now I was clocked off on 
crates. How about a permanent engine case shipping crate, all varnished 
and French-fitted and made to last for the next 200 years? That's when 
I started to suspect I was getting into trouble.
