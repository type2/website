&lt;&lt; Actually your entire bus is a vital part of your new Homeland Security

Terrorism Protection system. You may now refer to it as your self contained

&quot;incident evacuation vehicle&quot;. All you need to do is throw some extra

all set. Rendezvous point for evacuees will be the HCBF campsite.
