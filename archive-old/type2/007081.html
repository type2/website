Thanks to all who helped me get my 2.0 running.  I threw 12 volts all over
the little spade connectors on the carbs, and it idled OK.  But it had a
whopper of a valve noise, and spewed oil out the exhaust pipe on me.  So I
thought to my self, when oil is coming out yer tailpipe, it aint the carbs.
 So I decided it was engine pull time.  I pulled the engine and tranny as a
unit.  It took about 4 hours, 1 hour of which was spent getting the 2nd
rear tranny hanger bolt to 'leggo.  I'm pretty sick of looking at it right
now so I'll probably look at it this evening after the Oktobugfest.
I hope to hook up w/some of you there.
Russell
