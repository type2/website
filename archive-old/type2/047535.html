Subject: [T2] Alt. Failure Rate

Greetings. Was wondering what the expected life span (MTBF) of a rebuilt 
Bosch 55amp. alt. was. Put one in my ' 78 Westy four months ago, and just 
lost one of the three diodes in the pack today. The original alt. lasted 105k 
mi. Do the rebuilds from Bosch suck, or did I just get a bad one?
Thanks,
Robb
