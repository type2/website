Hi All

I have just read the latest edition of the Volkswagen Type 2 Owners Club 
magazine.
(This is a UK club).
An interesting item for those of us who have pre-72 bus's that use the 
smaller front brake caliper.
This I think is the EDO? caliper rather than the Girling caliper.
As many know it is extreemly difficult to find, either new or as a recon 
part.
The good news is, a guy in the UK has found a substitute, it is from a 
Mercedes and is part no.
213355. At the moment that is as much as I know, I am interested because I 
want to fit a new set
of calipers to Spooky.
If anyone has more info it would be very welcome, if I hear anything, I'll 
post to the list.
