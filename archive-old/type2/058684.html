Not necessarily.  The engineers were also under a lot of pressure to hold
costs and complexity down.

I don't really believe this either anymore.  I think a well maintained
stock air cooled VW engine will overheat if driven hard in extreme
temperatures, such as what you find in Arizona in the summer.

&gt;If your engine is getting hot, a temperature guage
&gt;won't solve anything.

It will keep you from driving on and causing the engine to melt down.

&gt;If your engine runs hot, don't drive it, figure out
&gt;whats making it hot and fix it.

How do you know if it's running hot if you don't have gauges?  Well, you
will know when it stops running due to a rod sticking through the case, I
guess.  :-)
