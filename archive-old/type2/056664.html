Subject: RE:  closet removal , 72 westy

&gt;hi volks, how hard is it to remove the closet from a 72 westy? the 
&gt;wife wants to put in new curtains.

Good news.  You don't have to remove the cabinet!  The curtain in that
window should be tacked to a thin piece of press-board (like the stuff
door panels are made of).  The board is held in place by 4 small screws.
They can be found/removed - 2 inside the clothes-hanging closet and 2
more in the back shelf/storage area.  After removing the screws, the
board can be slid out toward the front through the the clothes-hanging
cabinet door.

Good luck.
