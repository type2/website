Subject: Re: Fuel Line Routing and type

It sounds like you might have just plain black hose that probably isn't
even the right diameter. You should get the cloth braided fuel hose from
one of the VW vendors. You'll need at least 2 feet of it. Volkswagen
didn't provide a separate filter as there is one built into the original
fuel pumps. Current repro pumps don't have a screen so its a good idea to
add a filter, preferably before the fuel pump. The best place for the
filter, in my opinion, is between the tank and metal line so that if it
does split you won't have an engine fire. The metal line is important to
have going through the front engine tin and, in your '70 originally went
all the way to the fuel pump. There should also be a rubber grommet in
that hole to prevent the tin from wearing a hole in the metal line.

&gt;
&gt; On my bus, there is a rubber hose from the tank to a copper line to another
&gt; rubber hose to a fuel filter to another rubber hose to the pump and finally
&gt; to the carb.  Is this correct arrangement?  Is the copper line used due to
&gt; heat from the cylinder heads?  Can rubber fuel hose be used end to end?  Is
&gt; the copper line secured by anything after it comes through the firewall?  I
&gt; see where the rubber hose is clipped above the transmission.  Can anyone
&gt; point me to some photos showing what it should look like?
