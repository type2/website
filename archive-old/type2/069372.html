Subject: Re: Valve Adjustment and fast idling(Seperate?'s)

&gt;   Went to take my bus for a spin on Friday and it was racing. The idle
&gt;   was way to fast. I drove it to my parents about 10 miles away without

This happened all of a sudden? You may want to check the vacuum hoses
going to the distributor. The slightly larger one provides vacuum for the
retard mechanism and only really kicks in at idle. So disconnect it at the
distributor while the engine is running: if it doesn't speed up or if you
cannot feel some suction at the end of the hose, then you found your
problem. Turn off the engine. Check whether the other end of the hose is
well connected to the throttle housing, then connect a bike pump to
the loose end and pump; this should unclogg the small drilling in the
throttle housing.

If this wasn't the problem, then check your timing. Since the engine idles
too fast, it will be difficult to accurately check timing per spec (5 ATDC
at 900 rpm), so do it statically, as per Muir: the bulb should go on at
about 7.5 BTDC (note that Muir's table says 0 deg., but that's wrong).

If that's still not the source of the problem, then it may be a problem
with the fuel injection. First adjust your valves, then proceed as per
Bentley's chapter on Fuel Injection, end of section 5.1, page 24. (fuel
pressure regulator, aux. air valve, etc.)

&gt;   1.) Muir states to rotate the engine 180 degrees and Bentley 90
&gt;   degrees. Also Muir states to move clockwise when Bentley say move
&gt;   Counterclockwise. Which is correct?

Muir refers to the crankshaft, Bentley refers to the rotor under the
distributor cap.

&gt;   2.) Well I preceded to adjust valve 1 and 2, the first at TDC and
&gt;   the other at 90 degrees counter clockwise. Skinned the heck out of my
&gt;   nuckles but definately adjusted to .006. Did I follow the procedure
&gt;   correctly.

I use some old, thick leather ski gloves to protect my knuckles. :) Also
try using a longer extension to clear all the bruising metal.

&gt;   3.) When I got to valve 3 I adjusted the exhaust pretty easily but
&gt;   had a heck of a time trying to loosen the nut on the intake of 3. In
&gt;   fact I
&gt;   stripped it. I guess I'll have to crack the nut and order a set of new
&gt;   ones
&gt;   from RMMW's.

Or go to the nearest bug shop or even the dealer. Those nuts can't be too
expensive, right?

Hope this helps. Good luck! :)
