Subject: HOW CAN I FIND SOMEONE IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA TO RESTORE A 1981 VANAGON?
Date: Fri, 29 Jun 2001 03:28:40 -0700

Hi!

I am new as of today on this list. I'm buying a 1981 Vanagon with a pop-top,
my first VW bus.  It's in fairly good condition, but it has some body damage
and needs to be painted and a bunch of small other things. I'd like to turn
it over to someone in the Los Angeles area who is knowledgeable about
restoring interior and exterior on Vanagons and can do this well.  I've
searched through the dealer, etc., resources on vanagon_dot_com and have made
phone calls without much luck so far.

Can anybody help me find someone?

Thank you!

Paul Sweeney
