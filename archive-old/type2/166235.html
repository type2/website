Subject: Re: [T2] fuel pump bad?/gas tank blocked solved!

Yes I know about fuel vapors and sparking vacuum cleaners- that's why I 
used a 2&quot; shop vac hose 30 feet long to it standing far from the bus! 
Blowing air in let me see if anything loose was flying around in there. 
  For suction I used a restricted  small hose (about 1/2&quot; inner diam.) 
taped 5&quot; into the opening of the big 2&quot; hose allowed lots of mixing of 
air into the hose to make it very lean by the time it hit the vac.  This 
was used briefly at a time to let the vac vent out what it sucked in.

  Sucking air out of a gas tank (even an empty one) with a vacuum cleaner is
  a great way to learn about fuel/air explosives.  80
