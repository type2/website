&gt; Does anyone have a quick fix for the white plastic fasteners that hold

Yes, the white plastic lamp housings are still available.

(I have been thinking about putting them in my front doors
and wiring them in to the turn indicators.  Havn't had the
nerve to cut up the doors or spend the bread on new white
plastic lamp housings yet.)


The frugal way to go is to drill holes where the flimsy
plastic clips broke off.  Put a bolt through there and a
fender washer w/locknut on the inside.  Behind the battery
is a tough spot to get to (hint- remove the battery for
access).  Four bolts, washers and nuts are much cheaper
than two new plastic lamp housings.

You don't have to replace those lamps very frequently.
And you should take your battery out now and then to check
for and stop any rust in the battery tray. ;-)
