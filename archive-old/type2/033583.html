Subject: Re: Noise - Epoxy Bed Liner

The bed liner will not do much for noise reduction. It will add some mass
which will slightly reduce the structurally transmitted noise/vibration. I
think you will be better off using a product containing an elastomer
(rubber). Roofing tar will work better than the bed liner, but has other
drawbacks - it smells and burns, but it is cheap. Spray on undercoatings
should work pretty well and well as some other products that have been
mentioned on the list before - Koolpatch. There are of course more expensive
products specifically designed for noise reduction made by Soundcoat or
Noise Killer ($100 per gallon).

The basic idea for reducing structurally transmitted noise/vibration is to
block it or absorb its energy. Adding mass blocks it, and adding rubber
absorbs it (the vibration energy goes into moving the rubber around instead
of going into the air). There are many other damping/absorbing materials
that can be tried also, but remember everything costs money and adds weight.

&gt;    I was looking through the Eastwood Company catalog today and came
&gt;across Gator Guard II Epoxy Bed Liner.  I was thinking that a bed liner
&gt;product of some sort would be much better then using roofing tar for
&gt;coating the interior to seal and protect  it.  Or should I buy the
&gt;rubberized undercoating product 7 dollars a quart as opposed to over 40
&gt;dollars.  Has anyone ever used these or have any suggestions.  Any and
&gt;all appreciated.
