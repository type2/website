Subject: Re: [T2] case splitting tool

I take absolutely no responsibility for anyone breaking their case
because of taking my advice, but I found it helpful to put the flywheel
on the crank and use that to pry against the casehalf flange.
Especially helpful because it's usually a tight fit around bearing no. 1
and it keeps the crank in the correct half...

also, a rubber mallet works nicely to tap around the case.  Plus, you
can tap on the studs sticking through the halves.

again, tap really lightly or you might crack the case....

&gt;&gt;What's the best tool to use to split a a Type 4 case? Does the Type I case
&gt; 
&gt; splitting tool fit in the Type 4 oil pump cavity?
