Subject: Re: [T2] URGENT: drying the air-oil filter

I know this is a bit late,, but I say,, who cares about some water in the air
filter!
I bet the PNW &lt;Pacific North Wet&gt; area has that much humidity in the air all the
time!

Remember the days you'd pour a glass of water directly into the carb as the
engine was running??

oh,, some folks use diesel ... others wood alcohol... some use water...  to
clean the carbon off the inside of the cylinders.

I can't imagine a little water residue inside an air filter causing even the
slightest of concerns

&gt; My timing is for crap. I cleaned out my filter the other day agao and set it
&gt; in the sun to dry ... and last night it rained.
