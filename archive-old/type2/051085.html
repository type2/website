Subject: [T2] Update to bus parts buying adventure

Hi again
  Apparently &quot;European Motor Works&quot; has found my money order and is shipping 
the parts out to me. Turns out he had it all the time, I guess. 
    Wanted to let everyone know that this has apparently been resolved.
   Thanx
   Brian
