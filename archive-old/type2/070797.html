&lt;&lt; Subject: [T2] Towing a Type 2 ?
&gt; I am in the process of trying to buy my first Type 2, a 1974 Westy.  It is
&gt;located about 265 miles away and I was considering towing it home.  Will my
&gt;1998 Chevy Astro van be capable of pulling the van on a U-haul tow dolly? 

The Westy is at least 2800 pounds. I would get a U-haul and a tow dolly 
combination
and consider it part of the price of the van - better than risking it. just 
my .02
