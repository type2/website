&gt;Better yet, I bet if you posted your VIN to this list, the wizards
&gt;subscribed herein could tell you off the top of they're heads... &lt;Masters?&gt;

Please oh please do not do that.

All known information on VIN decoding and option codes is available from
the library at www.type2_dot_com. just click on &quot;Library&quot; and then on
&quot;Identification&quot;. You should not ask about VIN or M-numbers unless they are
not described there (they would have to be pretty arcane not to be there).

It's just that other people's numbers get tearfully dull after a while and
the information is already at your disposal.
