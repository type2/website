Subject: Re: [T2] TYPE 2=Truck?????

Did everyone miss the point here? This person is
saying he thinks he will be safer in a Geo Metro!!! 

Besides, what difference does it make NOW how it was
marketed 25 - 30 years ago? What were you thinking
when YOU bought it? That something with nothing in
front of the driver but a headlight is going to be
safe in a head-on collision?

It reminds me of Volvo's marketing - that gives the
illusion that people will be safer in a Volvo - which
they might well be - but one can generally guess ahead
that the Volvo up ahead will do something really
stupid / unpredictable / out of character for the
situation and it is my opinion that Volvo has
attracted those people who know they are stupid
drivers, thinking that if they drive a Volvo they will
be safe drivers.

You're as safe as you position yourself to be. That
Hummer coming at you - any better chances in the Geo
Metro than in the bus? I think not. In the bus, you'll
likely survive but lose both legs. In the Metro you'll
likely not survive. I have a friend who recently had
one leg amputated. He had a rough couple years but now
is enjoying life immensely. I guess life - and safety
are what you make of it. -BaH
&gt; I am curious to know if the type 2  was marketed as
&gt; a &quot;truck&quot; or as &quot;car&quot; when
&gt; introduced to the US market. I know that the panels
&gt; would be a truck right?
&gt; All this talk of how dangerous they are in frontal
&gt; impacts has led me to put
&gt; mine up for sale, and I am looking for a good Geo
&gt; metro (or Pontiac firefly
&gt; for you Canadians) to keep me safe.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any good sources of vintage ads?
