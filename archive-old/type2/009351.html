I'm with John one this one - my 195 Yoko 356's are quite a bit narrower
on the tread than the Uniroyals, same size that were on the van.  I can't
measure them right now, but the difference was enough to make me think I
should have duplicated what was one the Van.

.  I have a set of 195/75R14 C loader all season Sears tires on the '77
now that are 5-10mm narrower than 185R14 XZX's ---SNIP---
