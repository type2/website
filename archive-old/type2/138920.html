&gt; I 
&gt; researched it and found on the Autohaus Arizona website they say &quot;From
&gt; time to time, we hear the complaint that on some cars the SR15N (Bosch
&gt; new starter) cannot be installed properly due to an interference between
&gt; the starter solenoid and the heat exchanger/hot air box. This condition
&gt; seems especially prevalent on VW Type II and Bus/Transporter vehicles.&quot;

I've actually seen that quote before and found it an odd commentary. There's
also no mention of that in the archives.

Could this be a problem with the 67 bus? That model uses the same 12v
starter and the heat exchanger exits from the rear on the Type 1 engine. All
the previous starters were 6V so they would be a different part number.
