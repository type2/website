&gt; Ooopsie ..  erh ..  I need the number for the wiper switch 
&gt; for a '73/'74 with headlight washers :)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I need the partnumber for a '74 Bus with headlight washers. 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This switch is listed along with the other parts that make 
&gt; &gt;up the headlight washer system in a seperate drawing on the 
&gt; &gt;fiche. It would have to be a somewhat older fiche as the later 
&gt; &gt;ones simply list it NLA. I think it was something like 
&gt; &gt;211 955 501 D, but I'm not sure. (211 955 501 B is the regular 
&gt; &gt;one) Any help on this one would be greatly appreciated. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, 
&gt; 
&gt; Brian 
&gt; 
While this thread is going does anybody know the part number for the rubber 
elbow that connects the engine breather to the air filter on a pancake 
engined bus?Or a suitable alternative.
Your thanks in advance Mel from the UK
