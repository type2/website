Hi Everybody!

Just one week left until the type2_dot_campout. The location isHagan-Stone Park
in  Pleasant Garden, NC and the dates are April 16,17,18. All that you
really need to know, including maps, can be found at

 http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~vw69bus/everybus/everybus.html

As of this week I have reserved the ENTIRE &quot;C&quot; loop for us because it looks
like we are gonna need it!!! We now 41 sites with hookups reserved for us .
We are actually in a sorta fenced off area with a fire ring and a large
picnic shelter. The fee is $12.00 per nite per site ( 1 vehicle and up to 4
campers. )which includes a picnic table, use of the bathhouses and your
water and AC hookups.  There is enough room at each campsite for 2 buses  so
if you wanna or we need to we can doulble up but keep in mind that the
&quot;park&quot; will charge an extra$12.00 for the extra bus in the slot. There are
lotsa other sites there including another RV loop and a tent loop. There
will be room for everyon and everybus!!!!!  

Lotsa folks from far off are coming in for this so here is a list of carabus
