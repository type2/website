 &lt;&lt; If you put it on at the same time you
  put on the rocker arm assemblies it goes pretty easy.  I'm not sure if you
  can put it on if your rocker assemblies are already installed. &gt;&gt;
 
 actually your racker assemblies MUST be installed first.  there is a slot or 
groove that each end of the *springy* thing that must fit into these slots in 
the bottom of the rocker assembly.....doesnt make sense i know...but your 
manual should show it.   &gt;&gt;
