&gt;  Bentley says 7.5 BTDC for my '76.

&gt;  Hm, now I'm actually confused by what Bentley says:

For all dual vacuum dizzies, with no hoses, dynamic or static set to 7.5 
BTDC. With only the advance hose connected at idle dynamic strobe at 7.5 
BTDC. With both advance and retard hoses attached, 5 or 7.5 or 10 ATDC 
dynamic at idle depending on the year of your motor. Then you can verify 
full advance does not exceed specs dynamically. Note that the full range of 
all T-IV Bus dizzies are within 2 degrees of each other throughout. Any of 
them can be set up stock and work just fine for all of the motors from 72 
to 79.
