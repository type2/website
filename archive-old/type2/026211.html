	Subject: [T2] steering coupling flange

	I've searched the archives and pmailed a couple of you with limited
success 
	so thought I'd resort to the list. I know this has come up before.
Trying 
	to tighten up my steering this weekend, I came across a horrific
sight- a 
	very large crack (1/2 cm wide- I could see the bolt through it) in
my 
	steering coupling flange.  The flexible square disc above it
actually looks 
	good.  Sooo, I'm looking for advice from folks who have replaced
them.  My 
	sense from Bentley is that I can remove the steering column assembly
as a 
	unit, without removing the steering wheel, etc. and not have to
remove the 
	steering box.  How about electricals?  Will I need to disconnect the

	wiper/directional/ignition wires to get to this?  Any other advice?

	Parts I'll need?
	coupler flange I believe is 211 415 409 and coupler disc I believe
is 211 
	415 417.  should bolts be replaced too?

Good thing you caught it when you did.  My steering actually stopped
functioning (luckily in a parking lot) when I found the same problem.  It
turned out that the bolt that's supposed to pinch the coupler flange to the
steering box had stretched.  Make sure you replace that bolt with a grade 10
bolt.

You shouldn't need to undo any of the wiring with the exception of the horn
wire but you will need to uncouple the column from the dash and unbolt the
cover plate on the floor for maneuverability.  The plastic collar between
the cover plate and the column will probably need to come out as well.
