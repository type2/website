I wonder if these springs are specific to certain timing curves?  I
would't be surprised if this were true seeing how there are different
curves specified in the bentley manual.

&gt; Somebody was asking for one of these recently. I found two over the
&gt; weekend -- people pull the dizzies at the yards and leave the springs
&gt; behind. I fish 'em out with my fingernail. And I'm always looking for
&gt; more.
&gt; 
&gt; So if anyone needs one of these, I've got two spares. Drop me a line and
&gt; mail one off to you.
