 &gt; Laundry detergent works great for getting oil off of concrete. Pour it
 &gt; on; for really thick greasy spots, apply a little wirebrush action,
 &gt; let it sit for a while, hose it off.

Tide works especially well, I've found. But be careful what you do with the 
results; around here at least dumping oil down the swere drains, even is 
suspended in a detergent slurry, can get you thrown in the slammer because it 
runs straight into San Francisco Bay.

Well, you'll get a ticket, at least.  If you're caught.

Outside, I use kitty litter and sweep it up and take it to the household 
hazardous waste day cleanup site.  Inside, if you dump the result down the 
sanitary sewer I suppose it's better, since it will get treated.
