&gt; Bus sighting:
&gt; Front page of the Chicago Tribune Monday, June 21, 1999. A Reuters photo
&gt; by Russel Boyce. The caption doesn't say anything about the bus in the
&gt; foreground, but it's in Kosovo, no doubt, and it's a 73-79 white loaf
[snip]
&gt; This has not dissuaded the occupants, three of whom are pushing the bus
&gt; down a hill. Maybe it was stuck?
&gt; Looks like it was a pretty clean loaf before the war.

I saw that photo on the web... car theft is *rampant* in Kosovo, and I
think it can be safely assumed that bus was being stolen after being
stuffed full of all the crap they could find to plunder...
