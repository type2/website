Subject: Re: [T2] 2 Sliding Door Questions

From: &quot;Access Systems&quot; &lt;accessys_at_smart_dot_net&gt;
&gt; I was debating about your repro handle... I use the sliding door for all
entrys into and out of the van and it is my daily driver so the sliding door
gets a lot of abuse.  the plastic handles don't last very long...so some
years ago I made one out of Aluminum bar stock, not factory looking, left it
bare metal but it has held up for 8-9 years so far...

That's cool.  Curiosity, how did the original handles break for you?  My
original OEM handle shattered into a 7 or 8 pieces (the ones that I could
find) when it broke.

I forced a couple of our handles beyond their design limits to see when/how
they'd break.  The key seems to be the door operating as it's supposed to
without the latches hanging up, and making sure that the handle is properly
secured to the square nub.  Ours would be about as durable as the originals,
though ours are solid plastic rather than cast with the metal core as in the
OEM.  Ours still have the cap to cover the bolt.

Aluminum would be cool, but the closest that I can come is adding aluminum
powder to the castings.  They'd polish up like aluminum, but not have it's
strength.

Another solution would be for me to sculpt a heavier duty handle to go along
with the OEM-style handle.  Something thicker in cross section than the
original would be stronger, but it wouldn't be OEM-style in appearance.

Original (used) OEM's are going for $15.00 - $20.00 (US), right?  I'm not
sure what the other companies' repros are going for.
