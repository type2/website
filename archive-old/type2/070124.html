RVB say:

Hmmmm... Excepting Clara, the common ingredient within the thought process
was beer.

hey, im happy to get a beer,

VanBondo's solution:
Two pieces, vertical grain, sleep at night (dreaming of beer after the next
paycheck).

support piece for the main deck table covers most of the seam. Also looks
like there is enough room behind the two pieces to glue a thin support piece
over the back side of the two pieces

that's what i did on the last camper i was futzing with

BTW:
Main headliner piece appears to be 54 5/8&quot; in front (FIF) and 55&quot; in the
rear. The true 90 degree angles are on the passanger side. I triple checked
on two other old wood panels scavanged out of other campers. Getting the cut
around the rear part of the fresh air vent is a &quot;special&quot; treat that any
camper crafter ought to *really* look forward to. Copying the old panel
piece should work OK unless you desire a more custom/craftman fit. Mine we
pretty thrashed and added an element of excitement to each dimension.

well see about putting my 'new' roof pieces in tues or wed.   and as the old
pieces are toast, well also see  easy it is to get the new ones to fit right
using the old as a pattern.  better take a 'before' picture first..
