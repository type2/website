Subject: Re: [T2] torque converter

Scott, What you need is a new flex drive, it is the
same as a flywheel, It bolts to the crankshaft, and
the torque converter bolts to it with three 13mm
bolts. I have a spair one here, would you rather have
a used one in place of trying to weld your old one. If
you need the part contact me with a address to send
it. Phil
