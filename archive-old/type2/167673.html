Subject: RE [T2} lets be careful out there

news is reporting that a local pick and pull, CRazy Ray's a favorite
of many bus pilots in the mid atlantic area, just had a car fall on
one of their patrons.  the fire dept was able to free the person with
no serious injuries but lets all remember these things we play with
are big and heavy and can hurt us if were not carefull.
