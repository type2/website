Subject: shock fit problems
Content-Disposition: inline

&gt;Top goes right on over hardware- but bottom doesn't. The lower shock mounting
&gt;&quot;stud&quot; is bigger in diameter than the steel &quot;sleeve&quot; in the end of the shock.
&gt;    I took the shocks back to the store, explaining my problem. The counter
&gt;guys tell me that I just have to remove the steel sleeve from the end of the
&gt;shock- exposing just the rubber bushing.

You could do it that way. It might be easier to remove the old bushing from the
lower
shock mount though. That involves wd40, safety goggles, a cold chisel, and a 5
pound
sledgehammer, some good jack stands, a jack and wheel chocks.

Use the chisel to try splitting the bushing longways. I've gotten them off
before.

Your other alternative is to place the new shock in a bench vise and try
pounding out
the center ring, but I'd prefer to keep the new shock intact and remove the old
crap
on the spindle.
