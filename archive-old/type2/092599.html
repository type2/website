Subject: RE: [T2] Weber DFV 228

The only DFV in the Haynes manual is the 32/36 DFV. It is essentially the 
same as the 32/36 DFAV which is the 2 throat progressive used on the T-IV 
conversions. The Pierce catalog shows that the carb top/air cleaners are 
the same interface for DFV, DFAV and DFEV. Also, Pierce in not in LA, but 
Gilmore, CA. Sorry, but I think you have something so unusual that you may 
be best to just get rid of them when they get worn.

&gt;I have printed this out and will try to find info on them. DFV is common
&gt;but I don't recall ever seeing the 228 id. If I can't find them in my
&gt;resources, my next call would be to Pierce Manifold in LA, CA, among the
&gt;very highest knowledge bases and parts sources for all things Weber in
&gt;America.
