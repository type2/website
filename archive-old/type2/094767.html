1. My comments on wire colors are from a color schematic for 77 and 78 
models. My 79 model schematic does not show wire colors.

2. My 79 schematic does not show a &quot;hot start relay&quot; and does not appear to 
differ electrically from the 77/78 models in the area of the double relay.

3. I assume you are reading 8 volts at the coil in position #2.

4. 6 volts (in position 3)is not enough to dive the pump properly hence the 
low pressure.

5. 6 volts (in position 3) is most likely not enough to drive the ECU and 
electronic ignition as well hence no start even with pump working.

6.  I doubt that the pump, double relay, and ignition are bad. The problem 
is low voltage in pos #2 (8 volts) and lower voltage in pos #3(6 volts). 
Sounds like battery.

7.  You have non-stock wiring at and around the starter solenoid. Some one 
may have installed a &quot;hot start relay&quot; and it has failed.  I would restore 
to stock at this point. If the starter &quot;needs&quot; the hot start function there 
are better solutions (even better band aid solutions).

8.   Double relay 86a should be zero volts in ignition pos #1 and pos #2. It 
should go high in pos #3. This needs to be sorted out.

9. Hot start relays (loved by many) often mask a failing starter. They add 
extra load to the battery during start up. They also can fail and cause 
problems.

Hang in there.
