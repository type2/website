Subject: Thermostat rod

When I asked what the thread was on the rod coming out of the thermostat on 
a 1600 engine was, no-one seemed to know. So, for the benefit of the 
archives it is:

4 X 0.7

Or at least that's the die that ran up the rod cleanly and the tap I used 
when clearing the rusted in and broke off rod from the top of the new (to 
me) thermostat.

Hope this helps someone.
