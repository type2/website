&gt;airflow over the cooling fins.  There is a point of diminishing returns
&gt;that is a result of the design of the cooling system.  I don't know exactly
&gt;where this point is, but I suspect it is between 3500 and 4000 rpm.

I'll agree with that 100 percent!!  Anytime I'm driving on a hot day (90
degrees F. or more) and sustaining speeds of 70 mph or more (4000 rpm+), my
oil temp gets &quot;really&quot; hot.  I don't have a number to put to that since my
temp gauge doesn't show numbers, but it'll climb up to the 2/3 mark.  When I
drop to 60 on the highway, the gauge will drop to just below 1/2 and when I
slow to 45 mph going through a town, the temps drop a little more.  On a
cool day (&lt;75 degrees F.) I can run 4000 - 4400 RPM for hours without going
over the 1/2 way mark.

&gt;People like Mike Gensler who have bigger carbs can get away with 
&gt;more RPMs due to a higher torque peak, or so goes my theory.

I think David has big-carb envy!!  I give it about 2 more months before he
can't take it any longer and has to buy a pair.  But to go with his theory,
you also have to consider the increased wind resistance (assumed) and the
weight difference (the bus', not his) that his high-top bus has vs my stock
Westy.  I also run smaller diameter tires which in some twisted formula
taught in advanced physics class probably places less strain on the engine
for any given RPM due to different final gearing.
