Subject: Re: ignition troubles - Hall unit?

Mike

The most difficult part about replacing the hall unit is paying for it!
The hall unit has three very small wires that must bend repeatedly when the
distributor advance plate moves.  I have had the copper conductor break
inside the insulator before.  On the outside, the wire looked fine because
the insulator was undamaged.  This might be your problem.

Replacement is not terribly difficult.  You will need a snap ring pliers.
You have to pull the cupped shield off the distributor shaft without
bending it.  I did it by getting two smallish screwdrivers as levers with
the tips under the center shoulder of the shield near the shaft, then
prying the shield up with the two screwdrivers with even pressure, using
the distrubutor housing as a fulcrum.  Do not pry the shield up around its
outer edge, as this will bend it.  As you pry the shield up, be sure to
look for the small cylindrical pin that locates the shield properly on the
distributor shaft.  Its small and easy to loose.

After you get the shield off, use your snap ring pliers to remove the
circlip holding the hall sender plate down. Remove the shims, then remove
the old sender.  Look on the bottom of the old sender to make sure no shims
came away with it.  If so, replace them on the distributor shaft.  Place
the new sender over the distributor shaft, then the shims, then replace the
circlip, hall shield (with locator pin) and you're ready to go.

Btw, its not a bad idea to clean and relubricate the moving parts inside
the distributor while you are there.
