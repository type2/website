&gt; wondering if anyone has had experience with these guys. If anybody has a
&gt; great reference please pass it on, I will do the same with my own
&gt; outcome. Many thanks,

Yes, I did my whole restoration (67 deluxe) using their stuff. Excellent
quality, everything fit the first time, and they sent stuff fast.
Clay is friendly and knows his stuff. See Thoms Website for a 
page on Das Bulli Hous.
