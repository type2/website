Subject: Re: [T2] torque wrench


Last Sears Torque wrench I bought was way back when they were fully
guaranteed, when I was a DIYer. I started the shop with it. I was putting
175 lbs on a fastener when it went cachunk (200lb max wrench). This was 6
or 7 years ago. I take it to Sears. They say no way. I said guaranteed for
life. They said no way.

Weeks later, I do a favor for a client, got to talking and I told him the
wrench story. He says, &quot;Gimme that wrench and let me talk to Sears.&quot; He
takes it in, gets me a new wrench. I guess he just pissed and moaned better
than me. Sears is now like Harbor Freight, et al. Most of the tools are
junk. But if your very selective, a few of the tools are good quality. 

I'm still using the Sears wrench, but next time it breaks, I'll replace it
with an S-K or Snap-On.

&gt;thought of that one.  When I was at sears, it says they only have a 30
&gt;day (or 60, can't remember) warranty on those tools.  I read the label
&gt;on the other ones for sale...

&gt;&gt; &gt;I think it's probably a good thing to get my torque wrench recalibrated
&gt;&gt; &gt;before putting my engine back together.  It's a craftsman wrench and
&gt;&gt; &gt;it's at least 5 years old so it's probably a little bit out of
&gt;&gt; &gt;adjustment.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Where do I go to get this done?  Does Sears do this or are there special
&gt;&gt; &gt;shops that'll do it?
&gt;&gt; ==========================&gt;
&gt;&gt; It's a Craftsman.
&gt;&gt; Tell 'em it does not meet spec any more, and you want a new one.
&gt;&gt; Lifetime warranty on Craftsman tools.
