Subject: RE: [T2] Ground Strap - Redux

Thanks Karl... I knew there was a frame; I didn't realize it was uni-body
construction.

Wayne, I need a new battery, Gura

Wayne asked:


 Well, OK then...  I just finished R&amp;Ring (cleaning) the ground strap
between
the frame and tranny - I cleaned the battery to body strap last week.  
 
 Am I missing something - is there a body to frame ground strap anywhere?
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The body and frame are really one piece, as in uni-body.  It is all welded
together as a unit.

The negative cable goes to the body, the trans cable goes to the frame.
That's it.
