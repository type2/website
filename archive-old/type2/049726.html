Subject: [T2] Used copy of Tom Wilson's book?

Would anyone have a used copy of Tom Wilson's book for sale (rebuilding
aircooled engine)?
I've been waiting about 6 weeks for one to come in on order and meanwhile I
have a half-disassembled engine and need the instructions from Wilson's book
before continuing.
Thanks,
  --Robert
