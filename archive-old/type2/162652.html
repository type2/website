Subject: Re: [T2] accelerator cable

&gt; Well, I ordered the two longest cables for my 1.7L with the single weber

&gt; only vague information in Haynes.  Don't have Muir yet. Bentley probably
&gt; figures it's easy enough to figure out that it didn't warrant a
&gt; reference.  But I could screw up an anvil, ha.  Any advice before start
&gt; ripping out the old one?  And why does the accelerator cable need a
&gt; linkage to the transmission?  I thought it only regulated the carb.
&gt; Did someone say accelerator cable when they meant to say clutch cable?
&gt; I doubt it.  Thanks and cheers...KR

only the Automatic has a cable to the tranny. and that is to operate the
kickdown feature (talk about an oxymoron) but that is the short cable and
it uses a rod to the engine from the tranny.

if you need to stretch the accel cable (or any cable) consider extending
it at the front, my drop floor bus needed all cables extended a bit and
all the extensions are up front using a rod with a cable clamp on it.
