Subject: From WI to WY and back: Part Six: Back Home and reflections (trip
 narr)

We left Crazy Woman Campground in Gillette, WY early in the AM. We drove
through a number of small towns in eastern WY and western South Dakota. Our
plan was to camp at Wind Cave National Park, which has a small campground
(that, according to a ranger, &quot;has never filled up&quot;): flush toilets, no
showers, free firewood! We found a campsite, then drove to our next
destination, a large international Powwow sponsored by the Native American
Heritage Association about ten miles south of Rapid City.

As we left the campground, we saw a couple bison on the prairie surrounding
the park and got some good pictures. The powwow, which we stayed at for a
couple hours, was very interesting and worthwhile. We had dinner there, an
excellent handmade Indian taco (fried bread with a huge pile of taco-type
fixings on top). On the way back to the campground, we found a church with
a liturgy on Sunday afternoon at 5, then made our way back to the
campground.

It was about dusk. As we crested the hill just outside the campground, we
saw a herd of at least one hundred bison, including many calves, spread out
over the hills and road. We stayed in Guac at watched them for a long time.
I was kind-of hoping one would bump into and very slightly dent Guac
(&quot;that's where the bison tried to gore us in South Dakota...&quot;), but
fortunately for us and for the bison, they stayed at least six feet or so
away from us. It was amazing being in the midst of this herd, without
fences or barriers. It gave us a slight sense of what this area must have
looked like 150 or 1000 years ago.

The calves were really interesting. There was a group of three or four that
were hanging arond together, messing around, chasing each other around,
falling down, etc. Every once in a while one of the adults would get fed
up, and head-butt one or more of the calves, who then settled down for
about fifteen seconds.

By the way, without a fence or barrier between us, full-grown bison really
look big, like a ton each, most of which is in their shoulders. They can
run up to thirty miles an hour, too. Mostly they're pretty peaceful. Watch
out if their tails are up: it means they getting ready, in the words of a
ranger, &quot;to charge or to discharge.&quot;

The next day we got up later than usual. Our son Mark and I took one of the
tours of Wind Cave, an unusual cave in that it is still being explored and
its characteristic feature is its boxwork, which is found in relatively few
caves. The wife and daughter read in Guac. After the cave tour, we toured
Crazy Horse Monument. I didn't see any evidence of it, but the sculptor who
designed and began the monument (and whose family continues its
construction) must have been a VW person: his determination and ability to
deal with immense frustration  reminds me of many on this list. One detail
mentioned in an interesting slide show about the history of the monument
was especially telling: he did a lot of the early drilling with a drill
powered by an engine on the foot of the mountain. There was a scaffolding
consisting of several hundred steps connecting the engine and the drill.
Mountain goats often perched on the steps. Every time the motor stopped,
the sculptor had to climb down the steps, maybe kick some goats out of the
way, start up the engine, then climb back up. How many times do you think
that the motor would quit by the time he got back up? I decided that the
next time I dropped a freshly-greased part into the grit on the basement
floor I would be a bit more patient and not throw words and tools into
space.

We attended a nice mass at a church in Custer, SD, then drove to Rapid City
and ate sandwiches in Guac. Lisa began driving east, back home. After a
couple hours, I took over and drove through South Dakota and Minnesota.
Guac was running and handling great. As we reached eastern Minnesota, we
saw the results of the severe thunderstorms and tornados that had just
passed through the area earlier in the weekend: trees uprooted, sheet metal
in fields, bent road signs, crushed roofs. At one of the waysides in
Minnesota, the state had posted an incredible poem written by Richard
Wilbur inspired by a pony he saw when he stopped at this wayside. The ride
back home east and north through Wisconsin was calming and uneventful.

Some observations and reflections on our trip:

1. We really loved Wyoming. We hope to make an annual trip including
Thermopolis, Yellowstone, and (next time) the Grand Tetons. We'll probably
check out the campground behind Flagg Ranch next time.

2. Our guardian angels must have gotten battle pay, since we always were
given the presence of kind, selfless, humble folks when we had a problem.
Treating folks as you wish to be treated is a time-tested technique.
Believe it or not, people can lead satisfied, meaningful lives in isolated,
tiny towns :). And not all roadside mechanics are bandits.

3. Western, panhandle Nebraska is a great place to break down. Harrison,
the town in which we broke down, was a little reminiscent of Mayberry. I
half-expected Aunt Bea to come around the corner with a freshly-baked
pie.... :)

4. The only rudeness we encountered was in the Fishing Bridge RV campsite
in Yellowstone, trying to do the laundry. If you discount the Old Faithful
area, Yellowstone was remarkably untouristy and spectacular. And make sure
you go to Thermopolis (thanks, George and others who clued us in about
Thermopolis!).

5. I learned a lot about Guac. The faulty thinking I used in western
Nebraska (mistaking an ignition problem with the coil for a fuel problem)
was a real learning experience. Other than that, however, and the warm
start problem that I was able to fix, Guac ran great, getting about 18
miles/gallon even in the mountains in a headwind with a cartop carrier
driving the speed limit.

6. Guac (stock 78 [2.0 l, FI]) will get about 23 mpg on the highway if the
average speed is 60-65 mph. Above 65, the mpg drops about 5-6 mpg.
Conclusion: from now on, we're going to keep Guac at a max of about 65 mph,
even though there were times (o.k., with a strong plains tailwind, slight
downhill, straight road, no other traffic, no cattle gates) we hit about 85
momentarily (brief representative dialogue:
Me: (thinking) Wow! We're really flying, and Guac is hardly straining! And
look at those mountains! And all that sage!
Lisa (wife) (suddenly awakening): HOW FAST ARE WE GOING???!!!
Me: (very casually and calmly) Oh, not that fast, really, and we're making
great time! (gently but definitely decelerating to a speed closer to the
speed limit))

7. Even though Guac is a standard 7-passenger bus, the four of us slept
comfortably, if snugly, in it. We took out the middle seat, used a 3/4&quot;
plywood piece as an extension for the back area, and made screens out of
fiberglass screening and magnets, which we attached to the outside of Guac
when we slept in the bus. We used foam pads under our sleeping bags. For
next year, I am going to check out one of those tent-deals that fit over
the open rear hatch. I am also going to look into converting a nice, but
worn, canvas tent discarded by some frustrated campers during a rain-soaked
weekend last fall into a side tent for Guac. Being so close (two in the
back area, two on the floor) was not a problem, especially in Yellowstone,
which had a low in the upper 30s on the mornings we stayed there (it
briefly sleeted). We loaded the stuff we carried in the area previously
taken up by the middle seat (coolers, luggage, etc.) in the front seats
while we slept.

8. Bringing along all the spare parts and tools you can is a great idea.
Also bring along Muir and Bentley and whatever manuals you're used to
using. Also bring a piece of carpeting or cardboard or plywood to serve as
a work platform-you can stow it under the carpet in the rear hatch above
the engine. When you pack, keep the tools and parts and manuals readily
accessible.

9. Think positively about your bus. Why worry? Enjoy the ride! If you're a
praying person, pray a lot, especially when encountering a problem. And
that view you get sitting up high and straight through that big front
window....

10. This list is an incredible resource. Thanks to all of you!

The end, for this trip, at least.
