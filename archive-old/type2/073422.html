&gt;Another area of concern is installation of push rod tubes so they won't leak.
&gt;He recommends RTV which lasted only a short time for me before new leaks
&gt;sprung and I got to do them over with new tubes. A discussion of how to
&gt;install the tubes and seals so they won't leak would be very helpful.

This may be in the archives already but my method was to polish the pushrod
tube bores (where the seals touch the heads and case).  I started with
something like 240 grit sandpaper, then 400, then 600.  This along with new
seals and prelubing/twisting the tubes during install basically solved my
pushrod tube leak problem a few years ago.
