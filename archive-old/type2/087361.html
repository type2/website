Subject: Re: [T2] Sacrilidge, Subaru Ea-81 into 78 VW Bus

I've wondered about the possibility of ordering a Brazilian Bus front 
radiator and housing and  putting it on a project 83 Vanagon I'm 
playing with.  My son is in Brazil.  I'll have to write him and have 
him check their parts department.

I just can't seem to let loose of any vehicle I have ever owned!
