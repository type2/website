Hello all,

I still have the '77 VW Transporter for sale!!! It's looking for a home!

No dents, no rust, runs like a scawlded dog (TN joke) and with the new
paint, looks like it rolled off the showroom floor.

I need the money, you need a Bus. It's GOT TO GO!!! Ken...are ya' out
there???

Please buy my Bus so I can pay my costly tuition fees and graduate
college!

PLEASE get back to me...
