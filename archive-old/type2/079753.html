Subject: Re: [T2] sub-cultures

The week after we returned from Bulli Brigade in Fla with the 58 Binz , we
attended a local thursday nite street rodder gathering. Went again last
nite, the suicide 3rd door and dropgates kinda blew most of their minds, we
even had relookers from a couple weeks ago, asking even more questions.. It
was accepted well as most of them have know me for awhile. Only a small
local amount of VW's ,,,,,,later
