Subject: Re: [T2] Mig Tig or Arc

Scott,

Another Boo-Boo--

All the body shops in the greater Chicagoland area use MIG welder's--

Why?

A TIG is a manual devise--requiring a bunch of dexterity and much slower
than a MIG welder, and is cheaper than a good MIG welder by far.

A MIG is infinatley adjustable to any amperage thats needed --and burns
cool--actually cooler than a TIG on sheet metal--simply because you can
move faster, eliminating any warp.

They usually have a couple of other welding modes on them also--a stitch
as well a spot welding speed---

A MIG welder is faster than a ARC welder for any type of
welding--because it is cleaner--and eliminates chipping slag prior to
making a second pass.

So welding frame's on semis--to welding  a new cutting edge on the
bucket of a  a CAT is 75% faster than ARC welding.

A TIG is excellent, and actually a much better set up for aluminum,
stainless, as well as chrome molly--where you might want to do some
filling--such as building up a low area in aluminum-- 

A ARC welder can be used for repairing sheet metal--as long as its a 39
Packard---

Lets see---I went to welding school in 66-- was certified in 69 and my
first job was welding inner bulkheads in ships in the Avendale
shipyards---18 years old

Some how I moved down to semi's and have been doing body work on them
since 79---used to use a oxy / acet torch and coat hanger for wire,
until I bought my first MIG welder in 81---

A farmer told me years ago--&quot;there ain't nothing stronger than a
coathanger wire &quot; and he is right--they are high cabon wire, but you
have to move fast and continuois, to keep from burning through the
metal.


Later,

Terry

 
E-mail message   
  
Tig is by far the best. Unlimited heat control and precision. Any good
body shop will use a tig welder on panels. With a tig you create the arc
with a tungsten electrode. (Tungsten-Inert-Gas, TIG) TIG welders are the
most expensive by a big margin. 
Mig will work well, but the heat control is not as good. With a mig you
are creating an arc with the filler material, so in order to weld you
are always filling. MIG is a good compromise, since most people who
don't do it for a living can't rationalize the cost of a TIG machine,
but MIG machines are very affordable. 
An arc welder will not work for body work, you have very little control
over the heat, and the welds are just too fat. They are designed for
welding structural members, like angle iron.
