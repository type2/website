Subject: VDO oil pressure gauge-any experts on hookup?
References: &lt;004401c0e162$b68e5640$3083103f_at_waverqsn&gt;

Got a VDO elecgtric pressure sender and a gauge from Bus Depot a while
back, and got around to putting it in.  Couldn't find the directions.
Didn't get a reply to my query how to hook up the pressure sender (2
terminals, one marked G, other WK) to the gauge (3 terminals, marked S,
+, and blank.  I assumed that G was ground and hooked it up to ground,
as I did the center unmarked terminal on the gauge.  The WK on the
sender I hooked up to S on the gauge, along with a source of 12 volts to
+.  On a 1/2 hr drive, the gauge jumped to its highest (80-90 lbs and
stayed there.  It is responding to pressure, since coasting sith the
clutch in or out down a hill with the engine off gave the same reading
when in gear.   Did I hook this up wrong??  MB 78 Westy
