I just recently bought a 1983 Vanagon 2.0L Aircooled. It ran but wasn't
drivable because of a bad clutch. Fixing that was the easy part. Now I have
run into some electrical problems and have run out of ideas. I need some
help and hope you and your learned group can bail my butt out of the deep
stuff. I have already searched the archives and found no similar problems
so i think a posting may be in order. Iremain hopeful
