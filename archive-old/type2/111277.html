Subject: live and learn/ cheap parts is right !!

my apalagies to all for my rant on inexpensive parts,
excuse me i mean CHEAP parts, i simply will not jump
on the cheap band wagon again..

BD im sure carrys high quality parts, ive heard to
much good about their service and quality, although
some people you just cant make happy regardless..

anyway i received my CHEAP parts today, boy am i
disapointed, engine rubber to big to start off with,
my hubcaps are wrong (easy mix up there).

regardless i simply jumped into the deal to save a
buck and get my parts quicker, they were more local to
me..

ive had this prob. before with early T3 stuff before
but i wont mension any names.

live and learn,

rob
