Subject: Michelin tires

&gt;&gt;I have the Michelin XZX 185SR14 reinforced but I can't seem to find them.  The
&gt;&gt;tire place I go to said that he didn't think they were made anymore...

&gt;You're right.  They don't make the Michelin XZX any more.
&gt;My tire guy says the replacement is Michelin LTX 195/75-R14....

When I shopped for tires some months ago, the dealers here in the Bay Area
told me that Michelin's replacement for the XZX is the MX, which comes in
185R-14 size. There's a whole thread in the archives about tire width; I
chose to stay with 185.

You want to get the *reinforced* model, which some dealers think doesn't
exist, but it does. To add to the confusion, the MX also comes in a
&quot;rainforce&quot; version, which you don't want, which could lead to real case of
crossed signals when you talk to the tire guys (and they usually are guys,
aren't they?) on the telephone.

They cost a bundle -- around $400 for four, installed -- but they're great.
Quieter than their predecessors, and rock solid handling.
