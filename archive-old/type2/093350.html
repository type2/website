Subject: Re: [T2] Two questions ..............

Never, ever, ever seen shims under the distributor.

Compare the length of the dist drive and another dist drive and see if they 
are the same length.

Maybe some bum mechanic's idea of getting return business?


&gt;Today I found four thin shims stacked under the distributor lock down
&gt;holder.
&gt;I can't figure out the purpose of the shims.
&gt;The little spring is in the drive and this stack of shims looks like it
&gt;accomplishes nothing.
&gt;Any word from the 009 guru?  Type I engine gury?
&gt;------------------------------
&gt;I'm down to getting the horn working to get my 66 van inspected.
&gt;I've replaced the bad horn with a good horn and was just wondering about
&gt;the most common problems, hoping for a shorted day tomorrow.
