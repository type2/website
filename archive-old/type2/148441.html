Subject: Re: [T2] Wax

One more thing about our busses that is a wonderful thing... An acquaintance has one of those Magnum PI Ferraris. I asked him about it b/c I still love the looks of the car and they can be had for $25K (attainable when new cars can cost more...)... Friend tells me the distributor caps (and it needs 2) are $500 each!!! WOW! 

I'll stick with the VW Westy where I can do an engine rebuild for the same price... &lt;griN!&gt;
