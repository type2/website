Subject: RE: [T2] cross your fingers

&gt; I put ALOT of miles in those Fiat Panorama vans. Almost died in one
&gt; while avoiding a concrete truck making evasive manuvers. We squeeze
&gt; between the truck and the guard rail and he got back in his lane.


I'd love to have one, but not to drive in Italy. In Italy I think I'd prefer
a tank or a bulldozer.  The Italians are the craziest drivers I have ever
seen.  New York City cab drivers have nothing on them. Motor scooters
jumping onto the sidewalk if the road got backed up ... Ten cars at a time
trying to &quot;make it through the yellow light,&quot; so far into the red light that
it was about to turn green again ...  I remember driving along the winding
mountain roads on the way to Cinque Terre on the Italian coast in a VW
camper. These are winding two-lane roads with blind curves, no shoulder or
guard rail, rock on one side and a sheer drop down the mountain on the
other.... on which full-sized busses were passing eachother on the hairpin
turns!  They had no idea whether there was a truck headed right for them on
the other side of the curve, and if there was, they had nowhere to go but
straight down!  My wife was cowering in the back of the camper with our 5
month old baby, more in the fetal position than the baby was, begging me to
turn around and go back, or at least pull over and let the faster drivers
pass. (Pull over where?)  But once you're at the top of a mountain it's
about the same distance down no matter which way you go (unless you go
straight down, that is), so we kept going at all the speed the VW could
muster.  Beautiful coastline, though, once we got there.
