Subject: Re: [T2] Air Fuel Mix Adjustment

According to tuneyourengine_dot_com :

&quot;In general, however, optimum horsepower is achieved between 0.85 and
0.90 lambda (12.45 AFR to 13.2 AFR using regular gasoline).&quot;

http://www.innovatemotorsports_dot_com/support/faq.php

You can do this if your smog laws permit. Smog regs have made
manufacturers tune closer to 1.0 lambda (14.7 Air / Fuel Ratio), which
is part of why later VW's ran so hot.

 his corall) who wiill stick a exhaust gas analyzer up the tail pipe and tune
 my AFM to the desired mixture.
 
 What IS the desired reading I should expect him to dial in my '78 Federal FI
