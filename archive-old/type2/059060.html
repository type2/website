Subject: Re: Gas in Oil

  From: Unadahmer_at_aol_dot_com
  &gt;I went to change the oil and noticed that the oil did not smell right
  &gt;and after some consulting to see if what I smelled was actually what I
  &gt;smelled it was a unanomious decision that I have gas in my oil.  How did
  &gt;it get there and what should I be looking for?  This is a brand new long
  &gt;block and I wonder how much damage I could have done to this motor?

Besides the suggestions that have been made regarding checking the float in
the carb, you might want to also take a look at your mechanical fuel pump.
I did a long block swap a few years ago and was shocked to see my oil
level waaaaay over the limit after its first spin around the block.
Turned out that the pump was leaking right down into the case (perhaps the
stress of swaping it was enough to breach the internal seals?).  Changed it
and drained the oil real well, changed the oil again after a couple of
days, and all was peachy.

As to how much damage you did to the motor, look at the bright side: you
got rid of all that messy carbon buildup!

Ohhh.  New long block....   Guess there isn't a bright side.


Seriously, if it still starts when the key is turned on and can take you
to the liquor store and back without seizing up, it's fine in my book.
