Subject: Re: [T2] Snow tires...was[T2] re: Tire twist

&gt; I know that Weddle Engineering has a locked diff
&gt; for the vanagon trannies.  (Lockright I believe.)
--snip--
&gt; You don't really want limited slip.  There  are
&gt; lotsa 4wd sites that will explain the difference
&gt; if you wanna do a yahoo search.

Locked diff?  Yikes, wouldn't that be brutal on-road?  And on rear tires?  I
want to retain my all-around function, not create a rock-crawler bus. :^)  I
think a limited-slip sounds like my best compromise, but please enlighten me
if I'm in error.
