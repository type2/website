Subject: Starter problems

My starter/solenoid problems continue. I had my third
nostart event yesterday. I stopped by at the Honda
mechanic to pick up my wife's Honda....blah,blah,blah,
....they need it another day. OK, fine, I go out to my '79
bus and turn the key and nothing.

Armed with my toolbox, coveralls, and all the list responses
to my previous starter problems, I decide to try and get
this thing going. 
1) Put the bus in various gears and tryed rocking the bus
   back and forth. Turned the key, no luck.
2) Got out a hammer, went under the bus and whacked the
   solenoid (not much room to get a good whack in there)
   Still no luck starting.
3) Fiddled with my starter relay wiring and everything looked
  OK
4) Didn't have a jumper wire to try anything else electrical.

I repeated steps 1 &amp; 2 several times with no luck. I ended up
pushing the bus a 100 feet over to a slight hill and was able
to bump start it.

I arrived home 10 minutes later, shut off the engine and tryed
to restart. Nothing. I opened the driver door and listened while
I turned the ignition key. I can here a click everytime coming
from the back, is this evidence that the solenoid is working?

This morning, before going to work in my '67, I decide to try
and start the '79. Turn the key and voila, it starts. I appear to 
have a &quot;hot start&quot; problem, but I have a starter relay in place.
Does this mean that my starter is on its way out?

I will be pulling the starter/solenoid this weekend. Will open
things up and try to determine what is failing. What should
I be looking for?
