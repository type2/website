Subject: Seasons Greetings and Alt. part Question
To: Type2_at_type2_dot_com

Happy Holidays to All! And now for the question: Anyone out there have a clue 
as to where I can lay my hands on a 70amp alt. cooling boot? The one I had 
crumbled to dust when I went to replace the Alt. Am I out of luck?
