&gt; &gt; Any of you volks ever consider, or actually undertake such a project

I carry a manual &quot;come along&quot; type winch in the van when needed hook it to
the tow ring under the front, have only needed it twice but when I did it
was a REALLY NEEDED IT!!!  Worked fine but it did take two folks or a
winch get in try to drive, get out winch some more etc.
