&gt; I believe this---

&gt; After a certain point of speed the fan on the engine is actually
&gt; cavitating--

Cavitating is when the pressure on the low pressure side of the prop is so
low that the fluid in contact with it turns into gas.  With the bus fan,
the fluid is already a gas, so it cannot cavitate.

&gt; Like it is going so fast there is o way it can move all the air that it
&gt; is swallowing---

Ah, that would be stalling, where the fan cannot supply more than a given
force to the air.  This is the analog of an airplane at too high of an
angle of attack to keep flying.

In any case, there is a maximum rate of flow that the fan can push
through the fins.  This is called choked flow.  At this flow, the fan can
push as hard as it wants but the flow stays constant.
