Indeed, you can use the bell housing from a transmission. In fact, it makes 
the perfect cranking unit. You can actually use the whole transmission if you 
like, but the bell housing is very easily removed. The units that I've seen 
appear to be nothing more than a bellhousing cut in half. With the 
bellhousing on the engine, and starter installed, connect awire from the + 
side of the battery to the big terminal of the starter. connect the - side to 
the bellhousing. then all you need is a jumper lead from the hot side (15) of 
the coil to the + cable. use a screwdriver to jump the two terminals on the 
starter together. If you have a battery charger with a &quot;boost&quot; setting, it 
helps to hook it up to the battery as well. before I crank a fresh engine, 
prior to hooking up the coil wire, I crank the engine through until oil comes 
out of the pressure switch hole. This assures everything is oiled before it 
actually fires up.
