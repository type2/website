&gt;Is there a check valve installed between the booster and the engine?
&gt;  
&gt;
Yes.

&gt;(hey Late Bay folks: I assume the post '72 buses have a check valve, 
&gt;right?)
&gt;  
&gt;
My '73 has it's check valve along the aft large rubber vacuum
line.  The valve is found up above the accordion tube from the
left side heater box.  In the middle of the bus is a hard vacuum
tube and finally, up front, is another rubber vacuum line to the
booster.

&gt;This might also cause the same symptoms...
&gt;
So would a rotton vacuum line, or disconnected vacuum line
(use hose clamps) or ruptured diaphram inside the brake
booster, IIRC.
