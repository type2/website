It can be done in a simpler fashion.  One of my projects
is the addition of bright LEDs to the existing taillight lenses.  Wiring
will exit via a hole in the existing reflector and tap into the the spade
connectors for the tail and brake lights.  The standard bulb would remain
in place to provide the proper load for the flasher.  LEDs draw very
little current, so the added load could be handled by the stock wiring.

This would be nearly stock-appearing, but the light would be much more
intense.
