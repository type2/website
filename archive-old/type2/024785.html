Subject: battery drains at night. Can't find electron leak

All I have is a cheap Radio Shack digital voltmeter/ohm-meter. Removing all
fuses from the fuse box and testing the tension at each circuit separately,
I find that 7 out of 12 show no tension (I guess that's good). The other 5,
however, give me a fluctuating reading with a 15-second cycle climbing from
0 to 400 mV, a sudden peak at 4V and sudden drop back to 0. 
I have no idea what this means

As I tested this last night, the battery was already down to 8 volts. It's a
relatively new battery, too.

Thanks,

Sami
