Since I'm on lazy-digest mode I normally get a few
days behind in my reading.  I just read some posts
about the &quot;I just paid $7.6K for a bus that crapped
itself&quot; and have about 4 cents to contribute.

First off, I've owned 4 busses and sold 3.  Grand sum
total of all transactions is way, way below $7.6K so I
may not be as passionate as the purchaser of this
particular bus.  BTW, as is is as as is always is...as
is.  Caveat emptor and all that.

The last bus I sold was my 77 Westy deluxe.  The
interior was in pretty good condition, the exterior
was in pretty icky condition and the engine was in
unknown condition but running fine.  Sold it for $900.
 Paid $1000 for it but invested at least that much in
it before selling it.  Haven't heard anything from the
purchaser so I assume everything is fine.

The previous bus I sold was a really nice 67 Westy.  I
had put all kinds of money into it and had owned it
for over a year.  It ran and drove pretty well but had
a few issues.  I agreed to drive the bus up to my
seller to save him some time.  On the way up I had the
good fortune to break the shift rod coupling during
rush hour.  Oh joy.  Luckily I was in Waldorf, MD
(lucky you say?) and M&amp;S Auto was only a mile or so
away.  If you're ever in the area, shop there.  They
had the part I needed for about 10 bucks and I fixed
it in about an hour all said and was on my way.

I met up with the buyer and we went for a test drive. 
He hadn't driven the bus yet, just looked at it a lot.
 Honestly I don't think he had ever driven a 60s bus
(if you own or have owned one you just know) and I
explained that the brakes were pretty good but it
needed a new master cylinder so the brakes were kinda
spongy until you pumped it once.  It also needed some
tranny work so you had to hold it in second gear.  Ok,
no problem he said.  Ok, I said and handed him the
key.  He cranked it over and it fired right up.  He
revved it up a few times and sort of looked at me.  I
gave him that raised-eyebrow look that says &quot;Um, put
it in gear and go&quot; and waited for him to do something.
 He put it in gear and floored it.  It rocketed
forward of course thanks to the reduction gears and we
continued about half a block at about 5000 RPM before
I yelled &quot;Shift, shift, shift, etc!&quot;  He did (clutch,
what clutch?) and we did the same thing to third gear.
 By now we were going about 45 in a residential
neighborhood with about a half-block or so before
running into somebody's house.  I was being polite or
so I thought and said &quot;Ok, you'll need to pump your
foot once and then start slowing down.&quot;  Huh?  What? 
I'm a deer, those are headlights...  Anyway it wasn't
a very pleasant test drive and I had nothing but
second thoughts as I left the place.  I had driven the
bus all over with no problems and had the bottom-end
of the motor completely rebuilt.  I felt confident
that it would always start and run when I got in and
turned the key.  However when I left his house I had
the sinking feeling that he was in over his head but
who am I to say, right?  I was in over my head when I
bought it.

Haven't heard from him since so I can only assume the
best.

It's a 70, right?  Dormobiles are pretty rare here in
the US but Type 1 motors are cheap as dirt.  You
should be able to find a decent running motor for a
few hundred clams and get yourself on the road in no
time.  I know all kinds of people with Westys but
nobody with a Dormobile.  Small consolation but try to
look on the bright side.
