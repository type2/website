Subject: Re: [T2] Front Speaker and cubby hole shelf mockup

I am building it as a free standing unit totally sealed with 3/8-16 blind
inserts, then I will mount it with threaded knobs, I am thinking that this way
I can actually pull it and place it on the roof for loud camping (which I am
very careful to do only when it won't bother anybody else, and therefore
rarely do)

As far as the kick panels or doors, acoustically this is a terrible place for
a speaker, in front of you the way they would be in your living room is the
best, most cars can't allow for placing a mid in front of the passengers and
some of the best will put the tweeter in front of you, but seperating it from
the mid seperates the sound, but in many cases this is the best you can do,
fortunatly the bus does allow room for mounting the mid and tweeter together
facing the listener, the idea of having great sound in a car is pretty
exciting.

BTW, not a boom guy, don't want my car to rattle, don't want others to hear
it, don't want my ears to bleed, I like good music played as accuratley as I
can afford.
  Those look good to me, but it will be a PITA to seal a box shaped like that.
You probably know that already.


  I have speakers in that location in my bus and also installed them there in
another's bus... I find that they are much easier to hear when placed there
than when installed on the kick panels or in the doors.
