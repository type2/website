Subject: torsion bars and sagging

Rich,

First check that you don't have anything heavy in the suicide cabinet.
Could cause the right side sag.

I went through the hassle of resetting my torsion bars and it was a huge
pain!  And it is still sagging.  Make sure you mark the angle of the swing
arms BEFORE removing them so you know how much you are altering the angle.
Write me if you have questions about the procedure in the type2 library, if
you still want to do it.

You will need to buy spring plate (swing arm) bushings, 4x $8 each if I
remember correctly.  If you plan to ever replace/repack your rear bearings
you might as well do it while you have it all apart.

I plan to buy some coil-over springs that should help my bus's currently
slightly saggy butt.  Much easier than taking everything apart again.
