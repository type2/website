WoW!!

That's one purdy bus :-}
I owned a brand new '72 bus that I loved, but living in the desert,
high winds are a fact of life.

High profile vehicles just were not advisable for trips out of town,
so we sold it.

Now I have another &quot;72, but it's not an &quot;only&quot; bus.
It's just a project bus.
My transportation bus is a 1986 Dodge 3/4 ton Van.
Passes everything on the road except a gas station. :-}
