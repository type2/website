Subject: A Different Alternator Conversion Problem

Hello Listers:

I've been building a new engine for my 71 Bus, and decided to switch to an alternator.  I ordered one of those alternator conversion kits from a mail-order place that advertises in the VW magazines, and was initially happy with the quality of the parts in the kit.  Over the weekend, I put the fan backing plates(that came with the kit) together with the fan and alternator, then bolted this assembly onto the fan shroud.  Since the engine is on a wheeled rack that sits on the floor, I can stand over the engine and look down at the top of it.  In doing this, I noticed that the pulley on the alternator doesn't line up with the crankshaft pulley.  I fact, it looks like it may be off nearly a half-inch.  Is this acceptable?  I'm afraid the pulley belt will spin off.  So did the vendor I bought the kit from give me the wrong alternator stand?  When I push the alternator as far toward the fan shroud as it will go, it butts up against the alternator stand and leaves that half-inch mis-alignment between the pulleys.  Does anyone know what the fix for this problem is??

Thanks,

Jim Hood
71 Bohemoth Panel Bus
