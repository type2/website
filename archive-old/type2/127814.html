Subject: Complete Wiring Harness

Hey guys, despite my stubborness, I'm back. (I couldn't stay away forever).

My Bus has spent the past 6 months in the garage. I decided to go through the entire engine compartment and re-do everything. 

Everything seems to be fine except the wiring harness. It's hacked in several different ways. It works, but not the way it's supposed to.

Does the Bus Depot sell a COMPLETE wiring harness for a non fuel injected Bus on 12 volts?

I have a 73 Type2 with an 1800cc and a webber 2-bbl progressive.

I'd like to pretty much buy everything. The ENTIRE wiring harness inside the Bus (which includes everything from the stereo wiring, to the overhead dome light wiring, to the door jambs, the headlights, turn signals, tail-lights, you name it.

I also need the entire engine wiring harness. I can't seem to figure out what goes where. I need the harness that goes from the battery to the starter, from the starter to the ignition / alternator, etc. I don't even know if what I have is set up the way it was supposed to.

I have every book in the world, but just don't feel like reading it to repair something that should be replaced anyway. I want a perfect Bus. :) One that I can just hop in, cruise down the road, and not have to worry.. (too much).


Thanks!
