I've installed a Bus Depot setup, but it wasn't sold as a &quot;package&quot;.  I
just asked for a complete system.

&gt; How hard is the installation process?

Not hard.  You might want to brush up your selection of blue words for the
more challenging bits.

&gt; Will I need any special tools?

Lots of Liquid Wrench, applied every day for several days before you take
things apart.

&gt; Anyone out there used the Bus Depot system?
&gt; Is it really complete?

Dunno.  When I asked them for everything, I got everything.  I don't
remember the price.

&gt; Will the stock system be quiet (the current header setup
&gt; is a total racket)?

It's pretty quiet.  You'll hear more engine mechanical noise.

When I bought my parts, I bought as many Liestritz brand parts as they
had.  The difference in installation ease is well worth the additional
money.  I don't know if the $99 system is Liestritz or not.
