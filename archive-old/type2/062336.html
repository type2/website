Don't forget the other acronyms:

CRAPS
Creepy Rustic American Parts Stores

OACCPS
Only American Cars Count Parts Stores

WAVPS
What's A Volkswagen Parts Store

HPFAWPS
Huh? Parts For A What? Parts Store

I still think it's 
Friendly Local Auto Parts Store
but probably it's
Full Line Auto Parts Store


&gt; PS- I'm pretty sure that FLAPS is &quot;from (my) local auto (or aftermarket?) parts
&gt; store.&quot; Correcto on this count?
