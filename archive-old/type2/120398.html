&gt; &gt; If this is a FI system then you forgot to plug in the lead to the AFM or

&gt; On my bus any amount of throttle without the AFM connected will lean out and
&gt; kill the engine. At the time it was surprising to see the engine start and
&gt; idle without it.

In theory the engine should not run with the AFM disconnected.  There is a
switch in there that is supposed to shut off the fuel pump if the vane in
the AFM is not &quot;seen&quot; to be open. In practice there are usually enough
ground faults in our aging buses that the pump runs anyhow.  The injectors
fire at their idle rate and the engine idles just fine.  When you open the
throttle however there is no increase in injector firing and the bus leans
out and dies.

This is something of a safety hazard by the way.  Th reason for that
switch is that the pump SHOULD shut down in the event that no air is
moving through the AFM because the engine is probably not running.  The
reason it may not be running is that there was an accident and the fuel
system has been opened.  In that case you don't want the pump to pump
gasoline all over the place.

                             OOK!
