Subject: VWs and Pensacola

I don't want to get slapped on the hand, but I think this is legal on
Friday.

I am going to Pensacola for the weekend, and was wondering if anyone knows
of any good VW places to visit there.  Such as the &quot;SingleCab Depot&quot; where
Single Cabs start at $199. &lt;G&gt;

I am not driving my 1970 un-named Westy, as the motor is in the floor
(still with flaps temporarily &lt;?&gt;).

If you are going to reply to this after 3:00PM EST, don't bother, I am
already on my way, but thanks anyway.

Thanks!
Derrick
