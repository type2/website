&gt; Any thoughts were to begin when your FI ('79) does not start?  This is =
&gt; what I do know.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  New battery.. 12V every place it should be.
&gt; 2.  Fuel pump works when starter is engaged.
&gt; 
&gt; I plan on replacing the condenser and the coil.  If that doesn't work.. =
&gt; where next.

&gt; Thanks - Mike '79 9 passenger
