they're restored vehicles, as far as the law is concerned.  My
understanding, from a friend who worked/works at a shop that imports
these, is that there is a place in mexico that builds the brand new bugs
on restored, US titled, pans.  I've heard its a sanctioned part of the
VWoMex factory, but that's just rumor.


Unfortunely that doesnt easily happen for a bus....no detachable pan.
