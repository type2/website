Subject: Re: [T2] Heating with water - seeking what-if-ideas

WOW.

Good points - all 101 of them.

Stuff I never even considered.

Oh well, back to the drawing board!!!

&gt;Couple of problems right off the top of the heads:
&gt;What would you use for a heat exchanger that would survive being
&gt;submerged in water. Boilers (domestic) use a cast iron water jacket
&gt;and a circulating pump but the heat source is intermittant, controlled
&gt;by the thermostat - On an engine the heat is constant and would re-
&gt;quire two &quot;radiators&quot;, one in the bus for heat ( a heater core ), and
&gt;a secondary one outside to remove the heat from the water. A water
&gt;cooled car already has both.
&gt;Electric water pumps are readily available but not cheap. Racer and
&gt;marine suppliers have plenty available.
&gt;Electric fans would be needed at least on the heater core and probably
&gt;on the radiator, too. Placement of the (especially), outside radiator
&gt;would require forethought - airflow without being subjected to stones
&gt;or other road dangers.
&gt;Plumbing - What kind of tubing/piping? Stainless steel? Copper? And
&gt;fittings to make turns/connections? Sweated connections? Rubber
&gt;and hose clamps?
&gt;Expansion/overflow tanks? Water expands when heated. A domestic
&gt;boiler has a large expansion tank with an internal bladder to take up
&gt;this expansion and return it when cooling. A water cooled engine has
&gt;an overflow tank plumbed off the radiator, some even use an electric
&gt;fan after the engine has stopped to continue to cool the water.
&gt;Provisions for &quot;air bleeding&quot;...to prevent cavitation.
&gt;Put two different metals together in a water bath and you've created
&gt;a primitive battery. Dielectric connections? Sacrificial anodes?
&gt;I tend to think upgrading the air system at whatever cost would be
&gt;much cheaper than trying to engineer a water system from scratch.
