&gt; You wanna talk hassle?  Getting the engine mated to the tranny with the

&gt; of the engine compartment were removeable, but we have to take what we get,
&gt; I guess.

    I don't have much problem with that, once it's on the jack and
centered, then it's just up to level -- keep feeling the hole and the
tranny shaft's relationship with your fingers every other jack pump til
they're close, and shove it forward. Once the shaft is going into the
clutch plate hole and the two bottom bolts are started in their holes,
it's just a matter of grabbing the rear bumber with both hands, putting
your feet on the ends of the heater boxes and kickin' that puppy in --
jacking a little up or down as needed. If you look down from the top,
you can tell whether the bellhousing and the flywheel are parallel or
not, which they gotta' be, as they get closer and closer. 
    Sort of a sexual thing, almost. 8-) 8-) 8-)
