Subject: Re: [T2] fire extinguisher info wanted

I just got back from a busy afternoon at the junkyard, and saw a 77 that
was completely TOAST! &lt;shudder&gt; Carry something!!!!! I've got two, one in
the cab and one in the cabin.

The check-out girls (with whom I am on a first-name basis) commented that
today was the dirtiest they've seen me yet. :-)

Nikki

P.S. No luck finding an engine, but found lots of lovely bits.
