I've been driving my 1978 bus for about 6 weeks and I've found that vortex 
also.  Whole hours drift by when I'm driving.  Time has a noticeable 
stillness.  And this week I found that same ethereal quality in the time I 
spent working on the engine as Denmiester and Greg Potts helped me remove it 
and repair a cylinder head and put everything back together.

I also used to drive a sporty car - Subaru (which is U R A Bus when you 
spell it backwards).  Sometimes it's a challenging transition ... but I 
enjoy this time vortex much more than the darting and dashing of modern city 
driving.

I can see why so many other bus owners have more than one.  I'm already 
wondering what kind of bus I'll get next, and how I'll fit 2 busses in my 
meagre garage!

But I wonder... does the time vortex originate in the design of the bus, or 
the engine of the bus?  Is it generated by the put-put-put of the 
little-engine-that-could powerplant?  Or does it come from the somewhere in 
the body - the big vinyl dash or the triangle side window vents?

Heh heh heh... I hope it's from the design.  Then I'll feel better about 
wanting to put a v6 in my bus!
