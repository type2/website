&gt;when I rebuilt my 2 liter the head was flycut because it was not square

&gt;three shims under the cyl. to get (I think) .045 or so.   the heads

There is no reason to stack shims.  Rocky Mountain Motorworks sells shims
in many thicknesses - I seem to remember .015, .030, and .060 and .090
being available.  Buy the correct shim instead of stacking several.  Bob, I
can't understand why your mechanic didn't do this too.

Clark, with domed pistons you will be running a lot of compression even if
you put .015 spacers in place of the .006 ones.  I'd go with a thicker shim
to keep your compression down to at most 7.5 to 1.  I imagine you're way
above that now.
