&gt;Can someone recommend a good timing light that also does RPM and dwell?  I
&gt;found one at JC Whitney but don't know anything about it.  I was going to
&gt;get a multi-meter and a timing light until I found this combination
existed.

Bought a great timing light back in 1993 for $40 new - brand name Optilux,
German I believe
and it worked great all these years until it was stolen out of my van. As a
back up I have
the Sears light but will be replacing the Optilux asap. (btw, it costs more
these days)
