&gt; 
&gt;  I have a LHD '76 high-top, a German model. All European busses seem to have
&gt;  been fitted with the upright (beetle) type engine. Some 1700-2000cc engines
&gt;  are around, but for us they are not the norm. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; i recieved this message from a fellow member of the list......i originally was
&gt; interested in putting a beetle engine in my 72 van..( recently aquired cheap!!
&gt; with no engine).......it seems that this is a factory set up at least in
&gt; europe.  why is it that when i have posted a question to numerous companies
&gt; and individuals everyone ( except one person)  gave me this long story about
&gt; how it wouldnt work or would be underpowered and time consuming to retrofit.
&gt; so the question now is does anyone with some knowledge on this subject have
&gt; real info and facts to tell me if i need to find some special parts or
&gt; adapters to put my beetle engine in my 72.  will the clutch, press. plate, t/o
&gt; bearing all work?? it seems to me ( by a simple measurement that it will )
&gt; both use a 200mm plate.  anyways i would appreciate some responses on this ( a
&gt; rebuilt beetle engine can run a fraction of the cost of a type iv
&gt; rebuild)........from some who have done it and how long the are using
&gt; it....reliability, power, cost, time involved etc.                  thank you.
ZR72:
In addition to Joe Fournier's nice list of things to do to put a 1600 in
a late loaf, I'll add a couple more:
1. The input shaft on the trans has to be changed to a shorter one (the
type 4 engine uses a pilot bearing that's not in the gland nut (they
don't hod the flywheel on with a gland nut).
2. Air cleaner- if you're gonna drive this thing and enjoy it you'll
need preheated air 3/4 of the year in the US while starting and warming
up.
As anyone can see, unless you have access to many of these parts for
free,or if you are a master engineer/ craftsman, then it's probably NOT
economical to put a Type 1 engine in a late bay bus just to save a few
hundred dollars on a rebuild.
