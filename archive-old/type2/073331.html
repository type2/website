Hi,

I've been lurking here for, oh, three months now. I've nearly sold my
Jetta, soon to be replaced with a '78 or '79 Westy, if i can find one. A
friend of a cousin of mine in Pittsburgh has a '78 camper in good shape. He
says it's got a 2 litre engine, but the fuel injection had been taken off
and replaced with a carburetor [why would someone do this?]. Also, he says
there's some rust on it, and it needs a bumper, which he has, but not
installed. It hasn't really been driven much in the past couple of years,
though he's started it up occasionally, and he says it seems to run fine.
before he got a regular car, this was his primary vehicle.

He's only asking $2000 for it, including assorted parts and books. I've
been looking for westies in the $4000-$5000 range, so if this thing is not
too far gone, i'm willing to spend the difference to get it up and running
correctly, including having body work and a new paint job done.

I've asked him where the rust is located, and how widespread it is. are
there particular areas that are more problematic than others that i should
be aware of? like if he tells me that the floor pans are rusted, should i
not even bother?

Also, he hasn't said it's a Westfalia, which is what i want. he's just said
it's a camper with a stove, sink and propane heater. I've asked him to let
me know if it's a westy or not, but while i'm waiting for the response, i
was wondering - were there other camper conversions being done to '78
buses, besides custom homemade jobs?

thanks,

-perry
