After watching the second battery debate off and on for two years, I've
finally determined that Dave Schwarze's approach with the relay makes the most
sense. 

Now my question is what is it good for? The fridge in the 81 is propane or
shore powered so no need there. I can envision some interior, or even
exterior,  lighting but otherwise I'm drawing a blank. How do you folks who
have the batteries put them to use?
