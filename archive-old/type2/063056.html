Subject: New Parts Place Catalogs

Well FWIW recieved the new 1987 Parts Place catalog today
same ole shit, a bit bigger than last time, claim to know
all about them special cars like Van and Quantum syncros,
G60 Corrados, etc.  Having owned 2 of the above and dealt
with them for some years I'll say they don't know that much, but
the catalog is good and gives you a place to start when
comparison pricing.   I would certainly never pay more than
their price and quality and service to me has always been
good in 10 years of ordering though I know some on this list
have had varying opinions.  They do misfill your order more than
most and I was unhapppy with the quality of the Dansk wasserboxer
exhaust particularly when I soon learned the American version
was $100 or more cheaper, but still a good source.

Phone 810-373-2300  ask for the new catalog.

John
