Subject: Little bitty spring...

Don,

I have the &quot;whole&quot; receiver block (out of a '73) which includes a good
spring.
This piece bolts to body, slider door slides into it and it holds door open.

USED, $10 plus $5 shipping/handling.

Does anyone know of a source for the small spring that actuates the
hold-open hook feature on the rear frame of the sliding side door of a
'73 Westie?  Bus Depot, nor anyone else in the business carries it as a
new replacement part.


&quot;obligatory disclaimer&quot;
I am a &quot;virtual&quot; wrecking yard, selling
GOOD USED PARTS, mostly ORIGINAL STOCK.
These parts are thirty (+/-) years old,
That I pulled from a parts bus or traded...
I would use them on my buses, but they are
USED parts.    &quot;HAPPINESS GUARANTEED&quot;
