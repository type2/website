Subject: Re: [T2] Revenge of the &quot;African Queen&quot;

I'll bet it's the Dansk boxes.  They did not fit my engine like the old 
German boxes did.  The VW dealer didn't recognize the problem and 
torqued the nuts down until the studs pulled out in an attempt to quiet 
the leak.  After careful examination I found that the flange on one tube 
was bottoming out against the head.  I had to cut about 3/16&quot; off of the 
flange to provide clearance for the tube to seat against the head.  No 
sealing problems since, but the heater box is no longer level, which in 
turn caused the stock muffler to tilt slightly.  I can't complain too 
much since the Dansk boxes were free (through the LeCoz program), but I 
will go for the OEM German parts if I ever have to replace them, even if 
I have to get them used.

It could also be that your exhaust studs are loosening up.  If so, 
consult the archives at type2_dot_com for lots of info about repairing them.

It could also be that your copper gaskets (between the box and the head) 
are pinched or otherwise not seated correctly.

&gt; Well, I was wondering if anyone has had experience
