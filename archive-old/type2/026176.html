[...]Kind of like those ultra rare Karmann Ghias that were made without seam
lines or torsion tube covers.  Sounds like a bondo job to me.  If they
really made such a beast you'd find the parts for it in the parts book.

&gt; Subject: [T2] Body seam question
&gt; 
&gt; Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; So anyhow, Chris and I were talking in the type2 chat room [1], and the
&gt; subject of body differences came up [2]  One of the things that I *swear*
&gt; I have seen, but very rarely, are buses constructed with a one-piece
&gt; driver's side panel.  That is, there is no seam at the rear of where the
&gt; sliding dor would be if it were a double-door bus.  I know that the basic
&gt; chassis design allows buses to be assembled with left or right hand drive
&gt; and also left or right hand sliding doors (or both).
&gt; 
&gt; What I want to know is, were any buses produced that did *not* have
&gt; provision for an off-side sliding door? That is, a continuous panel from
&gt; the B pilar back to the rear corner. Was it certain years? certain models?
&gt; If you have a bus without this seam, please let me know.
