Adam, 185 is the stock width.  Stock tire is
185/15.  Remember that when the middle number is
omitted it is something like 82, 83, or 85
depending on who you believe.  

But the width is not the issue with respect to
whether or not your truck can handle a load. 
There are many many narrow 14 inch tires in
205/70/14 or 195/75/14 that are not appropriate
because of inadequate load rating.  The major
problem with wide tires is excessive wear on your
front end, not some inherent problem with load
rating.  

Load rating alone is the issue when searching for
a proper tire to fit your bus.  Some tires in 215
or 225 width are appropriately load rated.  In
fact, in more conventional tires only by going to
something like a 225/70 will you approach the
proper load rating.  

There are very few 185/15 or 195/15's available
these days.  The Coopers/Mastercrafts recently
discussed (and some don't like these) and Kumho's
are the only ones of which I am aware.  Many
truck tires are available in 195/75/14 &amp;
27x8.50x14, but don't assume they are have a
proper load rating.

I have had a good experience with Mastercraft
Courser R/D in 195/14, but would probably buy the
Walmart Liberators in 225/70/14 if I was buying
today.  YMMV.

Listmembers claim they run 225/70/14 and
27x8.50x14 with no problems so I assume about any
14 inch truck tire you put under the thing will
fit.  I say truck tire because reinforced
passenger style all seasons are a thing of the
past.  Maybe nokian is still importing them.  

Happy hunting.  Whatever tire you choose, make
sure it is properly load rated.  You will be
amazed at how much better the bus will drive with
or without a load when you put proper tires on
your bus or vanagon.
