Strange - I hadn't noticed that.  My '78 doesn't have that dished area -
except for the 3 holes for the emblem, the nose is completely flat
(well, curved, but you know what I mean).  I'm confused now.

&gt; Take a good look at the picture. It has the bumpout on it for the
&gt; 73-79
&gt; emblem and the lower turnsignal holes. Interesting compromise.
