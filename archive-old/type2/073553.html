------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C14A07.B3F21DA0

Hi everybody, =20
You people have helped me out so much in the past and it is always greatl=
y appreciated.  I just drove my bus out to Cleveland OH from NJ.  The bus=
 drove just fine all the way out here and even for a month after that.  F=
or the last week, we have had nothing but rain and it finally ended in ti=
me for the weekend which I spent under and behind my bus scratching my he=
ad. What happened was this: my bus usually drives just right- good oil te=
mp/ pressure( have guages), would always start right up, idle fine, etc. =
sometimes it would slightly stall in the rain when braking, but otherwise=
 it wouldnt.  Starting about a week ago, the bus started to stall out-esp=
ecially when braking.  It eventually got to the point were it wouldnt idl=
e.  Now it doesnt idle at all.  I suspected a leak in the brake vacuum ho=
ses because it would mostly stall when braking, but when i plugged the ni=
pple on the intake manifold, the problem persisted.  I blew air through t=
he idle screw hole and idle mixture hole-to clean them, There is plenty o=
f fuel getting to the carb.  The car starts up nice, but doesnt idle at a=
ll. =20
Here are the specs:
71 westy, 1600dp (3000 miles on it), 100 cam, 34pict3, 009, bugpack heade=
r w/ qp muffler, timing set at 8deg btdc static, points and condenser wer=
e replaced since breakdown.  Valves were properly adjusted also.
 I have set everything to where it was when the car was running nice, but=
 the problem still happens.  I talked to my local VW mechanic in Jersey a=
nd he is stumped.  I will lose my job if i dont get my car running soon. =
 Please help me out. It will be really appreciated.  Also if anyone knows=
 what's up with the VW scene in the Cleveland OH let me know....         =20
