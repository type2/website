Dave,
I have done the same thing with a motor that I ran for a number of years in
a '73.  One way to do it is to acquire a oil pressure switch from a Vega.
They basically did the same thing with their electric fuel pump.  The VW
switch &quot;opens&quot; when it sees pressure,  the Chevy one &quot;closes&quot;.  You will
have to plumb a short pipe from the block to get above the tin and add a tee
so that you can install both switches.  The VW one is connected normally to
do it's original job, and the other one is fed +12 and connected to the
grounded pump on the other terminal.  What this does is not allow the pump
to run unless you have oil pressure.  Using carbs, you will have plenty of
fuel in the bowls to get it started long enough to get oil pressure.
You may have to research a bit to find the real name of the switch on the
Vega, it is about twice as long as the one you are used to and was fitted to
the side of the block.
I used to race a beetle on a asphalt 1/4 mile circle track against Vegas and
we had them commonly available.  Yes, we usually won even though we were out
motored and carb-ed.
Hope this gives you an option,

&gt;I am putting a 411 engine into my '73 Sunroof.  411 were originally FI, and
&gt;the place for a manual pump isn't drilled out.  I am installing it as a
dual
&gt;carb set-up, as I have no means to convert the bus to be a FI system.  I
&gt;purchased an electrical fuel pump and have installed it, and am ready to
&gt;power it up.  HOWEVER, I want to do it so that it will shut off if the
engine
&gt;stops running...
