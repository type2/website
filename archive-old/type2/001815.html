Subject: Deceleration Noise

In the year that I've owned my '78 Bus it has always made a loud vibrating
noise when I drop out quickly from highway speed or  run it at high rpms. It
comes from the rear and really freaked me out on my maiden voyage. I drove a
friend's '76 and it made the same noise, only his was much worse. He said
his was coming from his &quot;linkage&quot;.

I've come to live with this noise but after my engine pull two weeks ago, it
has gotten worse. All I did was replace rear main. oil cooler and tranny
shaft seal. pilot bearing and re-torque my heads. the vibrating noise still
occurs during rapid deceleration ( completely letting gas off after high
rpms) and it occurs now at 55mph and starts to disappear around 65mph.

Is this the linkage my friend was referring to? Is this common? How can it
be fixed. I did jack my engine up at the engine and notice one of my engine
mounts split, could this be the culprit?
