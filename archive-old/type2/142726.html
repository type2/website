Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump Autopsy

&gt; What's wrong exactly? I've never opened up that pump and can't see what you
&gt; are pointing out in the photos as trouble.

The rusty chunks. I think the biggest problem was in this pic:

http://www.donimages_dot_com/73westy/pics/fuelpump/pumpbefore2.jpg

In the right half there's a screw with an arm holding a thin film
metal flapper. The rust was under that arm lifting it from the flapper
allowing the flapper to open before it should.

The rust was growing on the housing and on that arm. Everything else
looked OK. But since there's no real way to seal it up (I suppose
POR15 could do it but... I'm not buying the stuff just for a pump) to
me the pump is toast.
