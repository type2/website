Subject: Re: [T2] Main Harness - how difficult to replace

Volks,

I've done this.  My '73 is in all respects related to the drive train a
'78/9 and that includes the main wiring harness.  The '73 harness was for
dual carbs and I was installing FI, so I needed all the extr wires and the
FI subharness so I flopped harnesses

It is *not* difficult, and you *don't* need to remove the dash.  It is
*very* time consuming and a persnikkety PITA, but it is not at all
difficult.  The primary &quot;tool&quot;&quot; you need, as someone else mentioned, is a
color wiring diagram.  Get an old Bentley or go to vintagebus_dot_com.  Also
handy are a rool of strapping tape and 15' of heavy string.  The steps
are:

remove the battery;
remove the fuse block from under the dash;
disconnect all the wiring harness wires from the fuse block;
tie the string to one of the wires on the harness;
wrap the wires and the string in strapping tape to &quot;smooth&quot; them;
feed the harness to the rear of the bus and disconnect it at the rear;
use the string to pull the new harness to the front;
reconnect all the wires.

It really is just that simple, except that last step will take a day or so
of solid work.  All the wires are color coded and it all makes sense if
you take it circuit by circuit.  when you get doen, BTW, and have all the
connectiosn fresh and correct, you will be amazed at how well everything
works! Most of the electrical problems are just corroded connectoras and
removing and reconnecting them will solve that, at least for a time :-)

If you need help, feel free to call/write me.  I will *try* to walkk you
thru it as much as possible, tho this is certainly a job where being local
and having hands on makes a huge difference!
