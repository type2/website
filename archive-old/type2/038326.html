Subject: Re: Replacing window rain guard

Hello Tim,

I recently replaced the window scraper on one side and hated the job so much
I couldn't get myself to doing the other side. You need to strip the door
*completely*, including glass, vent wing, and even the felt channel. You
will also find that the aftermarket window scraper is of disappointing
quality. The chrome trim will be bent from shipping and the scraper is
actually too short, leaving a 1/2&quot; gap for water to enter! I ended up
reusing my old chrome trim, drilling out the rivets that hold the old
scraper and for lack of anything better, riveting on the new --though too
short-- scraper.

But... I don't think the bad scraper is actually the reason you're getting
water into the bus; some water will get into the door even with a good
scraper. What you are probably missing is the plastic foil behind the
carboard/vinyl panel, which is then tucked into the door to deflect water
towards the outer skin and away from the cardboard. The water will then
drain through the drain holes in the bottom of the door (as it is supposed
to).

Sami
