Subject: Re: [T2] Which Piston rings?

Holy Moly!

I phoned in my Bus Depot order around noon yesterday, they told me
they didn't have the parts in their warehouse but... UPS just arrived
with my parts. I am in New York so that probably plays a role.
Definitely phone in your order, ask for expedited shipping, speeds
things up majorly over web ordering.

Kudos to Bus Depot!

&gt; What with the Holiday madness of ordering &amp; shipping items, I would have
&gt; ordered this stuff long ago, not now, to make it for between Christmas &amp; New
&gt; Years.  Break down and telephone them (or someone else), don't depend on the
&gt; internet to get yer stuff to you in the time frame you want.
