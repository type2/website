&gt; I had my engine rebuilt in July because it threw a rod (3 days after
I bought
&gt; my doublecab, that's another story, but it makes me wonder about
&gt; coincidences).  
&gt; 
&gt; In the second week of December (5 1/2 months into the 6 month
warranty) it
&gt; threw a rod.  When my mechanic got it back last week from a small
Dallas
&gt; rebuilding shop. He said the rebuilder told him it wasn't under
warranty
&gt; because I had some kind of leak in the carburetor, and gas had
gotten into the
&gt; crankcase and mixed with the oil.  He said this reduced the oil's
ability to
&gt; lubricate and caused the thrown rod with no advanced warning signs of
&gt; overheating and no drop in oil level.  He said I should have been
able to tell
&gt; because I should have smelled the gas in the oil  Of course bottom
line is he
&gt; said the repair was not covered by the warranty.
&gt; 
&gt; On the slim possibility this is not a line of bull droppings to get
out of
&gt; standing by his work, I won't give his name - at least until I hear
the
&gt; consensus of the list.  Comments please.  If this is real, where is
there a
&gt; passageway large enough to the outside for oil to get into the
crankcase if
&gt; not past the pistons?  What do I check for to prevent reoccurence? 
If there
&gt; is some connection to the carburator, what do I look for?  How many
folks out
&gt; there smell their dipsticks?

He's full of it!  Sure, a small amount of gas can get into the
crankcase via a float valve leak, particularly if the vehicle was left
in a nose-up position.  It's happened to our bug.  _HOWEVER_ it only
happened when the bug was left on an uphill incline with a near-full
fuel tank and it sat for more than a month!  The crankcase pretty much
filled with oil in this time and promptly blew out the front seal with
no damage to bearings.

Normally, a small amount of gas gets into the oil via blowby, and it
is evaporated by the heat of the oil and then burned via the crankcase
breather tube.  If you drive the bus regularly then there is no way
for the gasoline to build up to a level that reduces the lubricating
properties of the oil appreciably.  If you did screw up the oil, the
likely result would be a siezed or spun main bearing, not a broken rod.

If you get a _big_ float valve leak, then a cylinder will fill up with
gas.  The engine won't turn over, since the gas locks the piston
hydraulically.
