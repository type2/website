Subject: motor mounts

  hay all,
 I need some info.
 I'm doing that heart transplant in my 1970 transporter and i need to change 
the motor mount brackets on the frame..
 the mounts from the 1600 are very different from the 2 liter.
 how do i get the old mounts off the frame I plan on using an air chisel
 and maybe some heat.
 this is a little bigger project than i thought it would be but she'll Cruz 
nice when she's done.
