Subject: [T2] CV knocking

Lately my right outer(I think) cv has been knocking loudly while driving,
happens mostly while decelerating. Is it harmful to the transaxle to drive
it like this? I got 4 days left till school is done before I have time to
fix it and I was kinda hoping I'd be able to make it to my final exams...
