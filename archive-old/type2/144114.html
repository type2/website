&gt; I have picked up a set of heavy torsion bars from a camper and would like
&gt; to put them into my deluxe (by serial number) bus that I use to haul
&gt; stuff.
&gt;
&gt;   will they fit, and how do I determine which splines to use...only wanna
&gt; take this mess apart once.  (yes they are marked L &amp; R)

They will fit, but the initial setting is a matter of guesswork.  You want
the ride height to be the same as the stock bus for handling concerns.

If you adjust the camper bars per the camper specs in a deluxe bus it
will ride too high, since the camper is heavier.

If you adjust the camper bars per the deluxe specs, the ride height will
still be too high , since the deluxe bars will twist more from the
unloaded position when load is applied.

You therefore want to start with a trailing arm setting a bit less (in
terms of angle) than the Bentley specs.  Unfortunately, this still will
probably involve trial and error.
