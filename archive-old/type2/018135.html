Hi All,

Well, I received a wake up call two weeks ago, after ignoring the dash
warning light for the master cylinder on Alice, my '71 deluxe, for about
a week. 

No excuses. I knew that I was stopping with only half a brake system.
Unfortunately hit a patch of wet and oily pavement and slid lightly into
the rear of an old pickup. Nobody hurt, didn't even exchange names, but
Alice (who was ready anyway, for some serious shop time for minor
bodywork, new engine and trans) now has a 3-4&quot; overbite. 

After spending some time  pulling her nose out yesterday, I realized
that between the work done before me and the complexity of the dents,
Alice would be better off with a new nose. 

Ron Salmon lists new sheet metal &quot;from the windows down&quot; for $139 on his
web site. Has anyone had experience with front metal from him ? Are
there any web sites or folks with photos of this procedure ?

If I undertake this procedure, is there anyone who would be willing to
host photos on a web site ?  Stephen G. ?
