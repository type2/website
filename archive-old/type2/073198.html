Subject: Re: Points and timing?


&gt;I have a 74 Transporter with a freshly rebuilt 1641cc upright dp, 009
&gt;dist, 34 pict 3 carb.  What does the list advise for point gap/dwell and
&gt;timing.

The list advises that we are not going to tell you until you fix this
first: you should not be able to see the ground through your engine
compartment.

Caughtcha!
