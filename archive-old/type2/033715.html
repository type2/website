Subject: What ta do about my carb in my 73 bus...

As I have mentioned before, I bought a 73 bus with a dual-to-single carb
conversion kit. From what I understand, the carb is a Weber DFEV. The bus
ran and would drive around, but I had to play with the gas ALOT. I took it
to a shop for a tune up and look thru and they went through and said the
engine was fine but that they couldn't tune the carb because they thought
that there maybe air leaks in the aftermarket manifolds (the seals). They
are not sure if that's the problem or if the carb is the problem, but either
way they can't doing anything further until the leaks are fixed.

Anyways, I got the new seals and installed them but the bus is still running
bad. I want to do something about the carb, but I'm not sure what, that's
what this email is for. I have a good knowledge of engines and how to work
on them, but am not well versed in carbs. I know how they work internally,
but don't know anything about tuning or troubleshooting them.

After looking around the net, I found a few options and want to see what
knowledgeable listers think I should do.

1) Get a rebuild kit for the carb I have (about $35 is what I found on the
net). Obviously this is the cheapest, but I've never rebuilt a carb although
I think I could do it. I don't know how long it takes either.

2) Get either a new or rebuilt Weber to replace the one I have. I would also
buy a rebuilt kit for the old one so I could dink around with it and have a
spare carb if needed. The bigger question here is that I'm wondering if I
should go with the rebuilt carb for $150 or the new carb for $200? $50 is
not a great amount, but I don't want to waste $50 if there is no advantage.

3) Buy a dual carb kit. I found a dual carb kit that I think will fit my
bus. Its from the latest JCW VW catalog. It runs $380 and contains what
looks like almost everything I need short of maybe some throttle cable
modifications. It has two manifolds, two 40mm solex/broso carbs, linkage,
air filters, fuel line, etc. It says it fits all type I air cooled engines
from 1500cc to 1835cc dual-port upright (is this what I have?) Would I have
to do much (if any) modifications to install this or is it pretty much bolt
in? Are there other better/lower priced kits out there? From what I
understand, this kit is supposed to be as close to stock as you can get
(other than actually stock).

If #1 is pretty easy to do, I may try this. #2 also looks like a good way to
go, but I would hate to spend the money if #3 is the way to go as I could
put it towards the price of #3. Although I really would rather not spend the
money on #3, if it would be very advantageous over #2, I may just have to
cough up the cash no matter how much it hurts.

Thanks for any help!! And thanks to all who have already helped me with
other things!

PS, does anyone know of a site that explains what all the Types are? Like
Type I, Type II etc? From what I understand, I have a type 2? It also seems
that a Type X vehicle can have a different type X engine in it? For example,
a Type II can have a Type I engine in it??? Also, how can I find out exactly
what engine I have (like CC and stuff)? THANKS!
