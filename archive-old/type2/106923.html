Subject: Paintinting a bus

I am in the process of painting my 76 Westy that was completely stripped of 
every removable thing including the paint right down to the metal everywhere on 
the bus. Any body out there done this before? I am having trouble getting all 
surfaces (knooks/crannies) right now I am putting on some primer (Zero Rust) by 
spray can. I have been told to buy both a airbrush and a detail paint gun. Any 
suggestions?
