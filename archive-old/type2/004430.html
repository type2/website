Sure wish I could save 'em all......but here are 2 that are going to the
wrecking yard:

79 Fed version non-deluxe pop top, no rust, runs and shifts fine. Missing
sink unit, no tables, upholstery redone. Sage green repainted dark green,
now it is black and white zebra striped. Lady is selling it to Pick n Pull
tomorrow morning for $80 cause it won't pass smog. They are coming at
9:30....

76 hardtop Westy. Runs. Mostly complete. Guy wants $100....

I have nowhere to put them.
