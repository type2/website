As I anticipate pulling the engine to get a the clutch, I'm making 
a mental list of things to do. When last I had the thing out, I 
noticed that the 2-piece vent for the oil cooler had some slop in
it and had a rolled edge, like there might have been some sort of
welting there to seal it up once upon a time. Is this true, and if
so, what can be used for the purpose?

Thx again.
