Subject: Spark plug coloration question

Today i took out the plug from the #4 cylinder if my 1600 dp
in my 71 bus.  The curved electrode arm was a very light grey--almost
white.  the other parts of the plug were from light grey to black--not
much brown.  I have had these plugs in for 400 miles of travel.  I was
told before that my idle problem could be caused by a lean fuel/air
mix.  Does the color of my plug indicate this?   
Any response will be greatly appreciated.
