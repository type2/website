Subject: Re: Flatbed tower in the DC area?

Also a few things I shouldve noted to begin with.
1) The house where the bus resides is being sold so I need to get it
off that property soon
2)  The bus also needs several things replaced/repaired (tires,
gastank, brakes, etc) before it is road-worthy so bringing the engine
to the bus like many folks have suggested isn't going to work.  (Tho
it is a good idea)
Thanks again

&gt; Hello folks
&gt;   I've been keeping my bus at a friends house while I was rebuilding
&gt; the engine.  Now the engine is about ready to go back into the bus,
&gt; but I need to find a way to get the bus back to my house.  So can
&gt; anyone suggest someone who would be willing to tow the bus from
&gt; Brunswick Md to Washington DC?
&gt; Thanks in advance!
