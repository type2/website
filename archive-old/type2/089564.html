Subject: RE: [T2] More living in a bus questions

I've got a buddy that lives in a rennovated short-school-bus. He pulled the
back 3 rows of seats out, built a cot, has heating and insulation. He's been
living in it for about two years, but I think last winter was his first. We
live in New Hampshire, so I'd call that an accomplishment. Anyway, he bought
a gym membership that has 24 key-card access, simply to have bathroom/shower
facilities. Aside from a sign up fee, if any, it works out to about $1 per
day. Not bad.
