&gt; If I couldn't see how much or little gas I have in my tank through the
&gt; filler neck I'm sure I'd end up out of gas on many occasions. Now I
&gt; will always wonder exactly how much gas is left in the tank past the
&gt; point at which I can see it, but at least I know it's about time for
&gt; more.

If you Sawz-All a small hole in the rear deck and in the top of the gas
tank, you could insert a small stick with a cork on the bottom end...
Just look in your rearview mirror to see the amount of gas left in the
tank... ;-)
