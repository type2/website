Subject: Re: [T2] Gas in oil

I believe that you will find considerable pressure in the sump with
broken rings, broken ring lands, crack in piston, scored cylinder, but
that is another story of blowing #3 cylinder. 
Fuel in the oil: How? was the question.
Without a compression check on the engine you can't go much farther with
the elimination process.

&gt;Yes TOO HIGH .
&gt;After 20 years of working on them I have seen compression
&gt;reaching nearly 170 . That's too high . With worn rings and even a 
&gt; worn
&gt;cylinder , oil and oil pressure can make it into the cylinders . 
&gt; Just because you haven't seen it , doesn't mean that it hasn't happened

&gt; There is no oil pressure in the sump, it exists in the bearing 
&gt; circuit. I am curious to hear more of this phenomena. ( I haven't seen
it ).
