Ken Madson [The Bus Co., Seattle WA] had an almost brand new turn
signal/dimmer switch assembly to fit a '71 in his booth at the Puyallup WA
VW Springmeet last Sunday.  He is an excellent source for good quality,
used, bus parts.

Ken's e-mail address is:    kenm_at_thebusco_dot_com

&gt;&gt;  i need two parts for my '71 westy:

1) passengers side mirror - the whole assembly, including glass. i
have one right now, but it's messed up and dented. i've got the
mounting hardware from the point where the arm meets the door of the
bus, so i need the arm, mirror holder and mirror.

2) headlight dimmer/turn signal switch. my turn signals work fine,
but the headlight dimmer is shot and i can't figure out how to fix
it.  i just spent a couple of hours staring at it and scratching my
head, and i'm not sure what's up, but i think it's definitely a
physical problem with the switch mechanism, because the thing doesn't
click anymore, and my highbeams just don't work.

if anyone has either of these, let me know what you want for them.
I'd prefer if they're in good cosmetic shape as well, but at this
point i just need them to get inspected.  &lt;&lt;
