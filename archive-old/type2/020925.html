Subject: Defective Tires



In response to the cracking tires,,,,
I've had more than one car come into work that the owners wanted the 
tires balanced because of what they thought was an out of balance tire.  
Turns out the belts in the tire had started to pull and formed a 
significant lump on the tire making it useless.  Sometimes the early 
signs of this are cracking and more wear on one part of the tire than 
the rest of the tire.  Cracks that large would make me think that the 
tire is defective rather than just old.  Old tires crack all over 
usually, not just real big cracks,

Maybe I'm way off,,,,, just what I've seen.

Isaiah
