&lt;applause&gt; &lt;the crowd goes wild&gt; &lt;what a message!&gt;

&gt;well, aside from the amount of energy needed to melt the steel, aluminum,
&gt;and copper (for wire), and to injection mold the plastics, and shape the
&gt;glass, there is also the huge amount of pollution output by the human side
&gt;of manufacturing a new car:
&gt;- all the designers who drew the plans drive cars, don't they? and their
&gt;  cars pollute.
&gt;- all the financial whizzes in the car company who figure out how much to
&gt;  sell it for drive cars.
&gt;- all the workers who assemble the car also drive cars.
&gt;- all the cars go from the plant to the dealer on diesel trucks or trains.
&gt;- and all the people who work at the dealership drive cars.
&gt;
&gt;so in the process of building just one more new car, at least 100 (my own
&gt;estimate) automobiles are &quot;used&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;now, admittedly, during one eight-hour shift, a LOT of new autos are built,
&gt;so the pollution from the workers autos is divided by that number. but still
&gt;it's a lot of cars. and it doesn't count all the roads that have to be
&gt;maintained for those cars to get to work at the auto plant. ;)

Which of course is true when you buy any *other* manufactured product, thus
proving that you are &quot;causing&quot; incalculable pollution when you buy a pack
of gum or pay your mortgage. I think Uncle Joel's message is genius for its
absurdity, which I'm sure is intentional. People get hysterical about this
(which should tell you that there is more emotion than reason at work and
should make any conclusion automatically suspect) (except mine of course
;).

- --Pollution is benign. Pollution *in concentration* is dangerous, possibly
deadly. It's the effect of it that concerns; no harm no foul. If you want
to pollute less, drive the same car just as often but move to the country.
Or work second shift, or third (third shift is driver's paradise). Parts
per million don't matter; health matters.

- --If I tell you &quot;you are being prosecuted because you are harming
somebody,&quot; the logical question to ask is &quot;who am I harming?&quot; If the answer
is, &quot;well, SOMEBODY but I'm not quite sure who,&quot; then you should conclude
that I am merely interested in prosecution for its own sake. Crimes against
&quot;the environment&quot; are crimes against a specter. In what other instance are
you required to prove that you are innocent of the crime of &quot;harming&quot; a
politician's whim?

- --If you want to pollute less, those of you who are carbeurated can burn
alcohol (which becomes nothing but CO2 and H2O) with no modification but a
change of jets. This will run you $7-10 per gallon, which is expensive
compared to gasoline but very cheap compared to a new car. You might even
help to make the next oil war not worth fighting--a helluva lot of Beetles
in Brazil run on what is essentially 200 proof rum. I am &lt;that close&gt; to
doing this.

Just stirring the pot. This thread has been admirable because it could have
been a flame war, but wasn't. I'd hate to see that tarnished.
