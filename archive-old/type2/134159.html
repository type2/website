Subject: Another seatbelt question

A while back you may remember I asked about seatbelts in a westy. I was
sure I had seen the mounting bolts in there. Well, yesterday as I was
working I thought I'd give it a looksie. I don't see any mounting bolts
or holes or anything. Does anyone have any ideas short of gutting all my
Westy cabinets and seat, pulling the floor and looking under there?
(This is really not a viable option at this time). I was thinking of
getting one of the $20 jobs from ACN, but I want to wait until I get
this figured out.
 
Thanks
