&gt; I saw Nizza brand tents on the second link below and was
&gt; wondering if anyone knows when they started making these? Were
&gt; they options for bays, vanagons, and euros? I have a friend who
&gt; has a couple of these and he wants to know what years of busses
&gt; they work best with. Any info would be appreciated!
&gt; 
These tents are not designed for any particular van/bus.  They will fit just
about anything provided the gutter is high enough to attach to.  I have a
tunnel type tent, also made by Reimo but not a model that Steve sells.  They
are IMHO very well made for the price.
