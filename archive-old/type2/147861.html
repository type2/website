Subject: Re: [T2] its different for dome lights

My '71 deluxe works like this:

Front dome is DOOR, OFF, ON.

Rear dome is ON or OFF, also controlled by the front switch, so both have 
to be ON for it to work. Different size than the front. My parents always 
used that switch as punishment when on long trips if we were reading or 
whatever in the back seat. If my brother and I started fighting or making 
too much noise they would toss us into darkness. I always wanted to rewire 
it like a dual switch in a house so either switch changed the state of the 
light when toggled.

If your front is not working, it is usually the door switch or wiring. For 
either it may just be corrosion or weak spring holding the bulb.

&gt;Craig,
&gt;I have a 71 camper so it might be fitted differently than 70 Neunsitzer, but
&gt;anyways.
&gt;
&gt;Front dome has 3 positions : ON with doors open, OFF, ON
&gt;
&gt;Rear dome is way bigger than front dome and has ON/OFF. Switch is on the
&gt;dome.
&gt;
&gt;I have a doubt though because there is also this switch on the dash (on the
&gt;right of the steering wheel. leftmost button) that I believe is supposed to
&gt;turn on one of these domes. My switch is broken and I dunno if it was
&gt;supposed to control dome front or dome back.
