FOAF has a '76 Westfalia camper for sale.  She wants to sell it
because she does not want her teenage daughter driving it.
I've looked it over on Friday and here's the scoop:

'76 Westfalia  -  Harvest gold (or mango if you prefer)
$3,900 obo
(714)964-2920

Good news:
105,000 miles on the clock with newly rebuilt 2100cc engine.
New radial tires.  
New tags. (probably passes smog inspection)
Interior is original and in great shape.
Front suspension looks straight with no tears in rubber boots.
Braking system is visibly intact with no signs of leaking.
No visible rust in battery tray.
From underneath, everything looks well maintained.

Not-so-good news:
Small surface rust around edges of drip rails and the &quot;fender&quot;
thingy that covers the aft sliding door track.
     (What the heck do you call that thing?)
Tranny has a dark film of oil and road grime (needs a spray-off).
Oil was dark on dipstick. (only 1500 miles since rebuild)
Rubber grommets that seal tin to oil dipstick and filler missing.
No child cot or free standing &quot;room addition&quot; tent.
I did not test drive it.

Any wannabus folks out there listening?  
You're on your own from here...
