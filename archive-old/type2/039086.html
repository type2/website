Subject: Re: thats the brakes

did you have problems with the brakes heating before they did the work?
Did they replace therear hoses?
Actually My first thought would be that the MC isnt relieving the pressure
to the rears I would first check the pedal  free play adjustment and
secondly I might consider it a MC problem with that valve  or possibly a
dirt blockage there.
As far as the backing plates.. hmmm the actual hardwars mounts through the
backing plate but flush to the housing. The brake shoes do sit directkly
on it though. I really dont know what differences there could be. Could
they be a different adjuster?

good luck
