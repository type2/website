Subject: Dizzy?

I recently swapped the 009 in my 69 for stock 205T dizzy with a few bumps along 
the way and just now got it all back together and Bus no start. I got it hooked 
all back up just the way it came apart although I'm not 100% sure the timing is 
set up correct. While I had the dizzy out I replaced the ground wire on the 
inside by saudering it to the little square nut that is held in place by one of 
the screws for the condenser which was also replaced. Set the points to .016 
and put a new cap and rotor on. I also checked the vac adv by sucking on the 
tube that goes to the diaphragm and that proved good although I don't think 
that has any effect on start up. When I set the timing up I took out the #1 spk 
plug and put the motor on TDC then stuck pencil in the spk plug hole to make 
absolutely sure this was TDC. The timing gear shims were replaced too with a 
3mm thick shim plus the two stock shims as per Bentley for the AK case. 

Any thought on why this motor ran with a 009 and not the stock dizzy?
