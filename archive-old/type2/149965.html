&gt; HI guys, quick question
&gt; I don't have my bentley at home this weekend as I forgot it at work, which is
&gt; over an hour away!  I'm trying to remember how to test whether the oxygen
&gt; sensor is giving a reading or not.  From vague memory it creates a voltage of
&gt; 0 to 1v does it not?  79 cali bus the oxy light just came on, and i noticed a
&gt; drop in mileage. pretty sure it is the oxy sensor but would like to verify
&gt; before going and spending the $70,  any tips to lead me in the right direction
&gt; would be apreciated.  thanks

You are right, it is a fluctuation from 0 to 1v approximately you are
looking for.

The o2 sensor light trigger is a simple clockwork mechanism, it is not a
sensor per se, which means that if the dash light is on, it is 30k (iirc)
miles since someone reset the clockwork. But is does not mean the sensor is
bad. However, 30k miles on an o2 sensor and it should be replaced.
