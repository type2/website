Subject: How to cut in for fuel gauge,bus (Oops, Hotbutton!!)

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! DONT FLUGGUP YOUR BUSES!!!
*If you cut the whole section out you can rebuild your carb(s) from the back
seat too!*

This is Freshman Mistake Number three!

FM#1 Neglected/cobbled fuel lines (no clamps and twenty years old).
FM#2 Cut the wheel wells
FM#3 Cobble a kew~ell trap door into the body metal to simplify that whacky
once every twenty-thirty year fuel guage sender R&amp;R chore.
FM#4 Cold chisel the hell out of your dashboard for guages, CB microphone
holders and cheap radios. Special targets are barn doors and one year only '67s
FM#5 Green or gold long shag carpet EVERYWHERE!
FM#6.....? &lt;dont get me started&gt; ;-)

I don't know how many other wise nice buses that I have seen with this
kew~ell mod. What's next? Cut Wheel wells!
Learn to pull the engine and drain and remove a tank!
Is it a chore? YES. Is it a bummer? YES. Ive done it a few fun filled times
myself. But, Please folks don't &quot;fluggup&quot; da busses!!!
