Dear Sam,
Bus Mechanics are few and far between in this area of the US. I can wholeheartedly
recommend Randy Bettencourt,  (Bettencourts off-road) who has been listed in information for years. He's
located just under Interstate 95, at exit 25 in Connecticut. That's just down the street
from you on the Bridgeport/Fairfield Line. A few years ago he was looking to sell
his lot full of bugs and retire, but I saw him at litchfield this summer and appears to
still be in the mix. A very nice guy, he specializes in installing bug floors but I'm sure
he'd be able to straighten out a bus problem. Good Luck.
