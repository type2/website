my friend is parting out a '72 westy. it's pretty much complete. email with
your needs and how much you wanna spend. email him, not me kryzko_at_yahoo_dot_com
. his name is chris.


 complete westy interior (the one without the sink stove, etc. has rear
facing jumper seat and z-bed, closet, poptop with punishment cot) minus
table and rear z-bed cushion. no child cot, sorry. recond wheels w/
passenger tires. 1700 eng. w/ dual carbs, complete (not running, new tuneup
parts installed). tranny. good glass including jalousies, minus windshield.
everything you need. extra set of rear brake shoes, unused.

i tried to tell him to get it going but he don't think it's worth it. too
much work, too little time.

peace!
