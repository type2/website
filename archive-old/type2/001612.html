Subject: Re: [T2] 5 speed tranny? Follow up. Tall tires?
Date: Tue, 5 Jun 2001 11:54:51 -0700

I got a lot of responses to my question about using a 5 speed Vanagon
tranny, all very interesting and informative.  Most of them asked what the
heck was I talking about, because the only 5 speeds available were diesels,
which had gearing even lower than the 4 speed bus tranny, and the elusive
synchro.  Well, I think the mistake I made was looking at info posted by a
German enthusiast http://volksweb.relitech_dot_com/helmut/GEARBOX.HTM which
talks about some 5 speed gas models probably available only in Europe.  You
have to wonder why VW would decide to keep the 5 speeds in Europe where
there are no long flat roads and only send 4 speeds to North America.  But I
digress.

So the consensus seems to be that at tranny rebuild time, one should swap in
taller 4th and/or differential gears.  Makes sense.  My tranny's doing fine
at the moment, (knock on wood) and so I have another question.

We've been talking a bit about tires, all of which makes me wonder what the
tallest tires are that will work in a bus?  Maybe that's the answer to my
rpm problem, although the price of a new set of tires probably exceeds the
cost of a tranny swap.  But at least it is another option.  So has anyone
run 215 75r 14s, or the like?  If so, did it do anything to calm the motor
down at highway speed?

Regards,

Grant

&gt;&gt;Is it possible to put a later vanagon 5 speed tranny with the 2L engine in
&gt;&gt;my bus?  I have enough power to pull a taller gear for freeway cruising.
If
&gt;&gt;possible, are these trannies suitable?
&gt;
&gt;I'm not sure what trannies you're talking about.  Vanagon trannies (80 and
&gt;up) shift on the side of the trans instead of through the nose like
&gt;baywindow busses, making them very difficult to install.  Also I thought I
&gt;heard that the only 5-speed ones were in the diesel and that the 5 speeds
&gt;cover the same range as the 4 speeds in the gas-engine trannies.  That is
&gt;all second hand info so someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
&gt;
&gt;I also have a 2-liter in an earlier bus (73).  When the web pages are
&gt;available again, you might want to search the archives on this subject, but
&gt;here's a summary.  The 76-79 trannies are geared taller but are physically
&gt;1&quot; longer and although you *may* be able to force them into place, they
&gt;will not fit correctly.  As a partial fix you can run the 210 or 215mm
&gt;flywheel, clutch and bellhousing from 75 and earlier busses with 002
&gt;transaxles with the 091 trans and only have 1/2&quot; of extra length.  This
&gt;will fit and work acceptably although it is a tight fit and your gearshift
&gt;knob will be closer to the drivers seat than it was before.
&gt;
&gt;The best solution IMO is to obtain a late 74 through 75 002 transaxle with
&gt;the 4.86 final drive and then swap in a .82 4th gear in place of the stock
&gt;.88.  This will give you a 4th gear ratio approximately equal to the later
&gt;busses but with a lower 1-3 gear.  I like this solution because I value a
&gt;low first gear ratio.  I actually drove up a road once that was so steep I
&gt;couldn't pull it in first gear (in Wyoming, dirt/rock logging road, 8,000ft
&gt;elevation, 27&quot; tires).  A lower first gear is also easier on your clutch
&gt;with a loaded down bus or starting on hills, and helps in that emergency
&gt;situation where you have to pull someone out of a ditch.
