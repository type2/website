Subject: Re: [T2] Weird sound... sounds bad... very bad...

I had symptoms similar to the adjustment of the clutch cable.  It turned out
that the end of the clutch cable was worn and it did eventually break
through.  The clevis pin is about 1/2 gone.

I also have a sound when the clutch is released.  I am certain that my sound
is the input shaft bearing.  Sort of a grinding, rattley sound that I can
just barely hear that goes away when the bus is warmed up.  My release
bearing makes sounds too.  That sound is more of a whiney singing that I
hear when I push in the clutch pedal.  At some point soon, all will get
replaced.

&gt; Steve and the list, I have the same symptoms
&gt; regarding the clutch adjusting nut.  Clutch nut
&gt; is all the way in.  Even had to put some washers
&gt; on it when I replaced it with a brand new clutch
&gt; cable.  I didn't measure the cable, but the part
&gt; number was right.  I also replaced the bowden
&gt; tube, but it the TBD repacement was a soft
&gt; rubber.  No idea how to shape the thing like
&gt; bentley describes with the replacement tube being
&gt; as flexible as it is.
&gt; 
&gt; Does this mean a new clutch, as Benthin suggests
&gt; and as the PO told me, or an almost worn out
&gt; clutch?  
&gt; 
&gt; I get a little noise when the clutch is not
&gt; depressed.  The noise changes when I depress the
&gt; clutch.  I also have difficulty shifting into
&gt; first and especially second.  I wrote this off to
&gt; bad synchronizers and am expecting to replace the
&gt; tranny.
