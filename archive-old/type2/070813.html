My 1970 stock Westy ,  after a by the Muir Book tune up . Driving up a hill 
hesitated  in third gear. I  adjusted the valves, set points with dwell 
meter, set timing,  adjusted carburetor according to Muir., checked vacuum 
advance. I am lost. And have a trip coming up to Tahoe ( all up hill from 
Sonoma County) and am concerned. Can anybody give advice? Besides the the 
hesitation, it happened twice in one day. It seems to run fine.
