&gt; Hello folks - got a MacGyver question for you. I'm interested in using an
&gt; older LCD screen from a dead laptop computer as a TV monitor in my Westy
&gt; (or anywhere else I need a screen).

They sell CRT-based televisions that run on 12v fairly cheap these days--you
could probably get three of them for the price of one LCD monitor. Get one
of those, a DVD player and an inverter, and you're set.

Alternatively, Sears has a special &quot;for vans&quot; TV console that not only has a
TV and VCR in it, but cupholders, and it would fit between the cab seats in
a walk-through. A halfway decent woodworker could whip up the same thing for
probably $300 cheaper.
