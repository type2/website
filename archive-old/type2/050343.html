&gt; 30 degrees  ATDC for 009 is wrong.  I think you meant 30 degrees BTDC.
&gt; If you're static timing (engine off), use 7.5 BTDC.  To time at 7.5
&gt; BTDC, you must first know what the mark on the pulley is.  I know
&gt; that for a 71, the mark is at 5 degrees ATDC and is used to time with
&gt; a strobe with the stock distributor and all hoses connected.
&gt;
&gt; You need to find out what your mark is at and then use it as a
&gt; reference to create a mark at 7.5 degrees BTDC for static timing.

&gt;&gt;  Be cautious with my statement though, as I'm not
&gt; &gt;sure
&gt; &gt;what the timing mark on your pulley means (again, assuming you have
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt;original pully).

&gt;&gt;  To
&gt; &gt;be
&gt; &gt;sure about what you are doing, you need the right data, you need to
&gt; &gt;know
&gt; &gt;what distributor you have and what the position is of the timing
&gt; &gt;mark on
&gt; &gt;your pulley.

The easiest way to find your TDC mark on your pulley:
Remove the 3/4 valve cover.
Rotate your engine IN THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION [not backwards!]
Watch the movement of the #3 cylinder valves.
You will see the exhaust open then close.
Immediately, you will see the intake open and close.
[If the exhaust opens instantly after the intake closes, you are going the
wrong way]
Keep turning and when the exhaust JUST closes and the intake JUST starts to
move, STOP.
Look at your pulley. If you have a mark pointing to the seam, that is Top
Dead Center, Zero.
If you don't, get white touch up paint and paint a mark on the pulley.

Now go here:   http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ovhignbo.htm  and find YOUR dist.
number on the list.
Click on the application. Read what your timing specs are supposed to be.
Time your engine to the distributor you have.
