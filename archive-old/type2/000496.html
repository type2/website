X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I followed the link below to view some pics of a listmembers new bus and it
brought up two questions.

1) There appears to be some extra springs that run from the throttle return
on the Weber to the breather box. I have the same sort of jury rig on  our
'72 1.7 w/Weber 32/36. I have found shock cord to be a little smoother in
operation. For whatever reason the throttle will not quite close without a
little extra help. Is this a design flaw or a mis adjustment on my part?

2) On the fan shroud there are quite a few extra tabs(bosses). What are
these for? I have seen some 1972 and up buses  that do not have them. I
would guess that they are for the smog pump hardware on the 73 74 rigs
(NOTE: although the motor pictured is a '79 2.0 they might have reused the
'74 tin etc.) My engine has a 1972 bus # on it but has all the same
tabs(bosses). Perhaps someone changed the shroud. I also have the red and
black marks on the pulley that 411/412 have but no real bus timing mark that
most have. Perhaps a swap was made to my shroud and pulley as one listmember
has suggested.

BTW, congrats to Chris, Kell and Tracy on there nice new bus.

Chris
