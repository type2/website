Subject: Westfalia (and other) side tents.....

A major consideration in all this interesting and lively discussion hasn't 
been raised, so here goes.....

In our part of the World, the US Pacific Northwest, a typical campsite in a 
Forest Service, State Park, or National Park/Monument campground will have 
some place to park a vehicle, a picnic table, and a cleared space intended to 
accommodate a tent.  There may be a fire pit.  These components are seldom 
well designed or thought out, and can be separated by earth berms, logs, 
cement curbs, and trees/brush.  In the worst cases the tent site may not be 
visible from the parked vehicle.

The &quot;parking place&quot; is rarely even close to flat, let alone level, 
necessitating sometimes elaborate temporary civil engineering projects to 
level out a parked camper so the occupants can try to get some sleep.

The rare &quot;tent site&quot; that is more or less level will be cleverly arranged at 
the low point of it's surroundings, so that debris and precipitation naturally 
accumulate there.  The really nice tent sites are invariably located smack in 
the middle of the most heavily-used route to the campground toilet facility.

What's left of the &quot;picnic table&quot; after the firewood scavengers have pried off 
all the easily &quot;salvaged&quot; bits will be filthy, covered with bird poop and 
moss, and perched at an angle rendering it useless for cooking or eating.  

The point here is that there simply isn't room to set up a van/side tent 
combination.  Only rarely is it possible to rig a tarp/awning out from the 
side of a parked van.  So....the tent or side tent just sits at home unused, 
being brought out for display purposes at swap meets and garage sales.

The exceptions to all this are camping on open beaches or in the desert, but 
even in these settings &quot;organization&quot; often rears it's ugly head and campsite 
design or circumstances make van/tent combinations difficult or impossible.

Apparently campgrounds in other parts of the US (and in Europe) do allow the 
van/tent combination to be erected and used, but out here, in our &quot;real 
world&quot;, you might as well leave that expensive accessory at home.
