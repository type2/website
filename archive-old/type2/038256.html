Yep, I set the timing.  I have pulled the carb off to clean it out,
installed a fuel filter (should have done this in the first place, duh) and
will reinstall carb this weekend.  Also replaced the brake boost line and
check valve (my brakes barely worked).  Slowly but surely it will be road
worthy.  I will let everyone know if I get it running and what ultimately
solved the problem if I get it fixed.  My personal opinion is that some junk
from the gas tank ruined my fresh carb rebuild by clogging the idle circuit,
oh well.  Lesson learned: always use fuel filter.  Of course, this might not
be the case.......

Justin, you didn't mention..but musta done the re-timing, right? Was your 
dwel within limits for new points..and how'd you set timing at idle? Sounds 
like most likely area..before I'd worry about the carb..tho that would ned 
adjusting after the rebuild of course.  Good luck..I'm sure it will pur 
soon.
