&gt; Can anyone out there help me on colour matching?

&gt; I've got a 1977 Westfalia/Kombi it is a hideous bright green with a touch of yellow.

I always refer to it as &quot;babyshit&quot; green.....first thing I did when I got
my 78 was paint it a different color.....isn't any wonder they didn't
sell more of em, the colors were horrible the last couple years

&gt; Would anyone know what colour this may be. Also what is the white - so that I can get the correct aerosols.
