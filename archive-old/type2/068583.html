Subject: [F] VW LULLABY CONTEST

To the tune of &quot;Brahms' Lullaby.&quot;

Lullaby,
Go to sleep,
We'll be back on the road soon.
Go to sleep,
in the bus
While the engine gets rebuilt.

Split the case,
look for cracks,
are we going to need a line-bore?
Weigh the rods,
mike the crank,
check the camshaft lobes for wear.

   Lullaby, 
   Go to sleep,
   &amp;c.

Get new valves,
and valve guides,
and those swivel-foot adjusters.
Don't use too
much Permatex,
or the case will not seal.

   Lullaby, 
   Go to sleep,
   &amp;c.

Ps &amp; Cs
are installed,
and the heads are torqued per Bentley,
There are 3
flywheel shims,
and the endplay is in spec.

   Lullaby, 
   Go to sleep,
   &amp;c.

All the tin
is in place,
and we're ready for break-in.
Fire it up,
hear it purr,
now we're ready to roll.

Lullaby,
Go to sleep,
we are back on the road now,
Go to sleep
in the bus,
to that lovely air-cooled sound.
