Subject: [T2] Brake line for 72 bus prob

I just ordered a brake line (not hose, got that too), for my '72 Transporter
for the left front (driver's side).  It is part # 211 611 723 (C) and seems
way too long.  The vendor is not open on Saturday, and I was hoping to get
going this weekend before the wife makes me sell the bus for being idle too
long.  The brake line I'm trying to replace is the brake line that screws
into the back of the caliber and then screws into the bottom of the flexible
brake hose on driver's side.

Two problems:

1.  The line has proper fittings, but seems way too long.  Anyone know for
sure how long it should be and if this is right part number?  I tossed the
old one, but don't think two feet long is anywhere near the right length. A
foot long would be more like it.

2.  The line is straight and the one that broke had some bends in it.  Is it
a natural thing that you have to bend the line yerself?  And if so, do you
just purchase a bending tool from your FLAPS, since they sell them.

Thanks.  This is a great resource.
