A lot of receiver hitches have a nut welded over a hole in the receiver.
After the hitch is installed in the receiver, a short bolt goes into the
nut and clamps the hitch to the side of the receiver.

I've also eliminatec rattling by making a shim that goes on the side of
the hitch to close up most of the gap, and then using a high-strength bolt
in the hitch pin hole to take up the last bit of play.  This is more for a
permanent hitch installation, though.
