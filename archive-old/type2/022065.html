Let me start by saying that I have no control on the 
word wrap from where I'm writing, so please forgive if 
there are a few stray long lines.

First off... THANK YOU CHRIS!!! Thanks to Chris and
everyone who helped organize Everybus. This weekend
is what bus owning is all about... good times, seeing good old friends and making good new friends. It was
truly one of the best events I have ever been to.

I got packed up on Thursday during my one of two 
vacation days that I have taken all year (Friday being
the second). After a restless night of sleeping from
excitement and bus performance anxiety, I sprang out
of bed Friday at 6:00 am. Ran up to the gas station to
fill up and warm up the bus for an oil change. Got back
home and changed the oil and filter and then her her run
for about 15 minutes to check for leaks (always have a
few drops after an oil change). Packed the kids up and
headed off to the parental units in Bennettsville, SC. 
I was anxious about The Terrapin Flyer's performance
as this was the longest trip since I have owned her and
the first trip since I had done a top end rebuild.
I broke her in driving to and from work for three weeks,
but this was a big deal. I pulled on to I-20 and she 
was rarin' to go. I had no problem keeping up with
traffic and after a while, I relaxed. The Flyer was
just purring along. Stopped a few times to feel the
dipstick and check for smells... I know I looked
like fool smelling my bus at the gas station, but I 
had to check. Got to Mom and Dad's and unpacked the
kids' stuff from the bus. When I opened the rear cargo hatch I noticed the familiar sheen of oil on the back. Got a piece of cardboard from the garage and threw it 
under the engine. Went in and visited and raided the
fridge. Came back out and looked and saw a spot on 
the cardboard about the size of a dollar bill. Checked
the oil and added a 1/4 quart and set off on my way
with Mom and Dad and the kids doing the Beverly Hill-
billy's wave down the driveway. The rest of the trip was
uneventful. I have no radio, which I considered a good
thing, as I might have missed an errant engine noise had
one occurred. 

Pulled on to Hagen Stone Park Road only to test my new
brakes when somebody who obviously didn't see the big 
blue bus with the smiley disco man tire cover on the
front pulled out in front of me. I almost tagged me a
Mercury Villager, folks! A little paler and a tighter spincter later, but glad of Mad Uncle Dave's diagnosis at Paddy's Wagens, I made my way to the campout.

I pulled in to find Mad Uncle Dave and The Award Winning
Burrito Express and pulled in beside them. Almost broke
my neck running to give everybody hugs, I was so glad 
to see them. Met good old friends (Bear, I'm glad that
rock at High Country spit you out) and instantly made
new ones. Spent the rest of the evening watching buses
roll in  while Mad Unlce Dave announced before even
seeing who was driving up &quot;Here comes so and so...&quot; 
Watching the Canadians roll in was the best. Spent the 
rest of the evening making S'mores with Jamie, Rob,
and the young Canadian gals who stole everybody's hats.

Saturday morning dawned bright and early at the crack
of 8:30 and I was in search of some decaffe. Spent most
of the day walking around looking at all the buses and
wondering how I could rig a bubble machine to my 
engine... Then came the Chili Cook-off. I was a judge,
so I had cleansed my pallette most of the afternoon.
There were so many good chili recipies that it was hard
to decide. One thing I will say, my allergies had been
bothering me most of the afternoon, but suddenly 
ceased to be a problem as soon as I had a few bites of
the John Muir Memorial 40 HP Chili. After the feeding
frenzy that we called dinner, (and by the way, thanks to
the wonderful woman that brought the ham),the door 
prizes were handed out. Off to the case burning - a 
cool sight to behold. I tried to round up friends that I had met that hadn't seen one before to come with me. 
After that, I heard the faint sounds of guitar picking
and made my way to the shelter and found where I 
wanted to be. There was an impromptu bluegrass-
western pickin' goin on. I kept having to get up and 
get a cool refreshing adult beverage and kept missing
the fair lady singing. Each time I came back, I heard
that she had sang while I was gone, so I sat my butt 
down and waited - tapping my toes the whole time. 
Finally she sang &quot;Joleen.&quot; Her voice was like Manna
from Heaven. She sounded like a cross between a 
young Dolly Parton and Allison Krauss (my fav). I sat
there until they finally wound down an hour after quiet
hours (couldn't help but notice the park ranger tappin'
his toes, too.) If anyone has video of them playing,
contact me. 

Went back to the fire with my new friends and 
discussed how this was what like life was supposed
to be. 

Woke up Sunday morning and cooked some
bacon  in the bus. Probably the best modification I
could have made to The Terrapin Flyer - she still 
smells like bacon when I get in. Spent the morning 
lazily packing up and saying goodbyes. Pulled out
about 10:30 Sunday, purred the whole way to Mom
and Dad's while stopping by pottery shops and 
veggie stands on the backroads. Picked up the 
kids and made my way home.

Finally got home and found out that my oil leak was
coming from the bell housing - an engine pull is in
order. 

All in all, thanks to everyone who came to make this
such a special event for me. Thanks again to Chris 
and his crew. And last but not least, thanks to the 
Park Ranger that was so cool. Gotta admit, he was
very tolerant of the goings on....Not to mention 
thanks to the peeps that were the last to go. I heard
that the park was cleaner than when we got there.

The one thing that would have made this campout 
perfect wold have been the attendance of Nikki Elko.
We missed you Nikki!!!!!!
