Subject: Re: [T2] Re: master cylinder replacement report

I'm told that the rubber hoses fail by collapsing...

&gt;My right front wheel was fine, but my left front system was clogged.  I 
&gt;had my daughter put some foot power to the brake pedal, and low and 
&gt;behold, the left front rubber brake line got four really significant 
&gt;bulges along the top of the hose.  The bottom 1.5&quot; still was not bulged, 
&gt;so I think that must be where my stoppage is.  The rubber brake hose looks 
&gt;like an over stuffed sausage.  And BOTH the left and right front brake 
&gt;hoses looked very good on the surface.
