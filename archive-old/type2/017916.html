hemp does not neccessarily mean marijuana. so it is in fact legal to do
what you would like with hemp since hemp is legally grown in this
country. hemp is legally grown in all countries &amp; marijuana is legal in
all the countries in the world except i think 7. people are getting wise
that its much safer method of mind altering than alcohol. consider the
simpistic facts that if you drink too much you will die. if you take too
much aspirin you will die, no amount of herb can kill you. even caffeine
can kill. now which would you choose? jah holy herb! i recommend a westy
bus becuase there are many cubby holes throughout :)
