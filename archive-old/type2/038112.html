Subject: Drapes

Where can I get some new drapes for my 71 Westy?  Also, where can I get the
tent accessories that hook to the side of the sliding door?  I am new to the
list.  Just bought my first VW ever.  Restoring it and hope to use it
soon!!!  Any websites that have interior goodies would help.  Thanks
everyone.
