&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;rob: the steering box has an adjustment bolt- check the bentley.
&gt;&gt;&gt;if you have a lot of slop at the steering wheel , this can help-
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;jack both front wheels off the ground (use jack stands ),
&gt;&gt;&gt;grab the left front wheel and turn it sharply, you should be
&gt;&gt;&gt;able to see the slop in the drag link ( slight movement off-axis ).
&gt;&gt;&gt;have a helper do it while you look, after you get good you can do it
&gt;&gt;&gt;alone. grab the drag link and wiggle it hard to see, also. or put a vise-
&gt;&gt;&gt;grip on it and jerk it.  eventually you will find the play... it doesn't have to
&gt;&gt;&gt;be much to be bad, but you should be able to see it, failing that, have
&gt;&gt;&gt;your mechanic save it to show you, and try the feel on the new one
&gt;&gt;&gt;before he installs it...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;wiggling the wheel up and down is a test for wheel bearings, and side to
&gt;&gt;&gt;side is a test for tie rods and other steering components ( drag link, etc.... )
