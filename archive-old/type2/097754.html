Subject: Fiberglass Pop-top/high-top paintable?

I was just snooping around on the net and saw a couple camper busses with 
painted tops. A few were westies, some others were high tops. 

I am going to have my high top V-dub painted in the next couple weeks. Can 
the top be painted just as the body? It has a hard finish to it, not like 
some of the early westy tops that seemed to have a rough, non-glassed 
finish...

And...has anyone ever treated or epoxy coated a top? Any info is welcome.

Thanks in advance for any information. You guys really help out.
