Subject: Re:oil filters (NonVW tangent) 

&gt;On the '47 Dodge, there are all sorts of clues.  The pop, the sound of oil
&gt;squirting against the front hood, the pressure drop, etc.  That car,
&gt;however had a wierd filter arrangement.  It was not your typical screw-on
&gt;canister but a container that held (are you sitting down?) a roll of
&gt;toilet paper.
Not so wierd. I recently read an article about a new truck oil filter
that involves regular replacememnt of two paper towel roll filter elements,
and much longer oil chnge intervals. It was being checked out by a truck
engine manufacturer, who was tearing down 500,000 mile engines with, and without
The gist was the new filter engines were still fully within factory spec.
Sorry I don't have a reference for this.
