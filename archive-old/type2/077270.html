Subject: Where do they go? (Vac lines)

As previously stated, I am going to replace the 009 Dizzy on my 66 ('71 1600 DP engine) with a stock vacuum dizzy.  I have a 34pict3 carb. So there's 2 vac lines on the stock dizzy, one closer to the rear of the engine ponting down, and 1 closer to the front of the engine pointing toward the dizzy body.  And there are 2 vac line on the carb (1 on the left side of the carb, and 1 on the rear of the carb).  AND there's also 1 vac line on the intake manifold) I'm no math genius, but I can see that with 2 vac ports on the dizzy, and 3 on the carb\intake that there will be one too many (or few) lines.  So exactly how do these lines connect?
