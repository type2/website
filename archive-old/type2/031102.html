&gt; &gt; If you have to carry spare parts for daily driving, you are 
&gt; &gt; anticipaing failure. If you do not compromise basic maintenance
&gt; &gt; procedures, you are insuring success and don't need to carry
&gt; &gt; any spare parts.

and nothing 20+ years old ever breaks unexpectedly either.

&gt;  Breakdown cover (AA, RAC, AAA etc.) insures against failure.
&gt;  Periodic maintenance ensures reliability.

&gt; &gt; The Deutscshes Methode will set you free, reduce your cost per
&gt; &gt; mile, protect you from perils, and improve your life.
&gt; 
&gt;  Yep, this is good stuff, but if you don't mind me saying so you
&gt; could stand to lighten your tone a touch :-).

&quot;Murphy&quot; doesn't operate via the Deutscshes Methode either (Mach Nicht)
