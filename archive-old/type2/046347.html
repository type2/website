    My two kids absolutely LOVE my frog green '78 Westfalia and insist that 
we take it everywhere.  We are fortunate enough to have a drive in theater in 
town (Glen Dale, West Virginia) and their idea of a big night is to hit the 
drive in, pop the top and crawl up there with their pillows and blankets, 
unzip the screen and watch the movie and munch nachos 'till they fall asleep. 
 And I love the fact that this is the kind of stuff that their childhood 
memories are going to be made of.
    If they miss the bus (school bus, that is) and need a ride to school, we 
have to take the bus and leave the 'junk car' at home.
    And my wife was really glad that I bought this bus, even though it was my 
13th vehicle.  She will deny this if asked, but I can tell. (Her own 
childhood memories include an orange '73 Campmobile.)  
    I never saw myself owning a loaf, FI, automatic bus, being more of a 
vintage guy myself.  But I think that this is my favorite VW that I ever had 
(have).
