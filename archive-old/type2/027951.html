The story certainly is sad and shocking.

The police have released an Identikit photo of the alleged attacker, so
hopefully it will return some results.  The air and land searches are still
continuing according to this mornings news bulliten. (That is - Wednesday
morning).

Obviously the public do not know everything that the police do about the
crime, but I find it odd that one man can conceal a body, alive or otherwise
(the female did not see her boyfriend when she was abducted), and tie a
female in his ute, as well as hide his vehicle and the campervan.

This is a very scary event.  It has long been suggested that people
travelling alone (esp female) do not stop for other motorists.  Of course in
the outback it is a bit different, but from now on it appears that it will
be necessary to not stop, or if forced to do so (as in this case), keep your
doors locked, window up and talk through the glass.  Keep the engine
running.  This is what my girlfriend and I will do when we make our trip at
the end of the year.

This leaves the question - would you stop for a fellow type 2 driver?
(Assuming you didn't know them at all).

Despite this event I believe that Australia is still a safe and great place
to travel.  It would be nice to get a few more Australian members on the
AIRS list.

My sympathies to the families involved.
