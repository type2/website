Subject: Upholtery buttons for TMI upholstery

So the instructions were very vague when I pulled my old upholstery off, and
nowhere did the TMI instructions say &quot;Push in on the buttons and carefully
unhook them from the wire holding them in&quot;. So I just pulled off the seats
(tight fit on originals) and of course broke the buttons on their eyelets
that the wire goes through.
Now I notice TMI makes the replacement buttons too. Hmmmmm coincidence about
not mentioning the buttons? :-/
In any case, I can't find a supplier, has anyone seen someone selling the
buttons?
Thanks,
Courtney
