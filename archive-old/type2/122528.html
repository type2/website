&gt; I am looking for a hard-to-find part for my '79 westy.
&gt; It is the plastic stop which pushes on the sliding door plunger switch
&gt; (which turns the dome light on/off), part number 211 947 575A. I have one
&gt; from a vanagon in its place, but it doesn't fit very well. P-mail me if you
&gt; have one.

&gt; Who mounted a switch on the B pillar on your Westy?
&gt; 
&gt; I have never seen one on a Westy, only on buses.

interesting. that would explain why i have never seen another westy with the
switch. i think it is a good thing to have, it is nice to have the dome
light come on when you open the slider.

i did not mount it in my bus, but it looks completely original, the wires
are the right colours and have factory ends.
