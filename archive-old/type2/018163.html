        The major difference in the 050 is that it doesn't retartd the
spark on #3, don't think there's all that much difference in the advance
curve -- at least it sure doesn't go nearly far enough, just like the
009.  These are both dizzy's for the T1, upright engine, not for the T4.

          Why do you say the Weber progressive doesn't have a vacuum
port? Mine sure did, because I had to plug it. Somewhere here I've got a
Weber book, I'll look for it tonight. Do you know your carb model #??
