Subject: engine trial assembly, cleaning, painting

Dear Volks:

I am finally getting around to assembling the Berg engine I bought about 
four years ago (stored IN the house--boy did that piss-off the wife!).  In his 
sermons, Bob Hoover recommends painting the case and cylinder, cleaning 
the case and engine parts, and doing a trial assembly.  I could not, 
however, discover in what order to perform these tasks. : ( 

Would somebody please put the following into the correct order:

A)  clean case and engine parts
B)  do trial assembly
C)  paint case and cylinders

thanks!

.....be on the road in no time.

Rick the Mold Farmer
