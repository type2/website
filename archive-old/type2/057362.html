Jim;

Thanks for re-posting Bob's archived message to the Lists.

Perceptive folks will comprehend Bob's observations and apply them in the
context of the recent controversy.  The clueless among us will be angered
further by your (and Bob's) &quot;presumptiousness&quot; (assuming they even know
the definition of that term).

Contrary to current &quot;educational&quot; and &quot;media communication&quot; standards, I
am unwilling to sit idly by and allow the Lists to degenerate into forums
catering to the lowest common denominators.  All of life's endeavors and
tasks require some sort of base level knowledge/information and
vocabulary/jargon.  Whether the focus is aluminum siding sales, nuclear
physics, or air-cooled Volkswagen repair and maintenance, it is incumbent
upon those new to the field to become at least minimally informed before
taking it upon themselves to criticize their mentors or re-invent the
pertinent task or technology.

As any number of wise women and men (including Eric and Barb) have
persistently counseled over uncounted decades (paraphrased):  &quot;When all
else fails, READ THE MANUAL and/or INSTRUCTIONS!!&quot;. 
------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanatory Note For Shawn, and others of his ilk:

I've been driving, repairing, competing, and living in air-cooled
Volkswagen vehicles (including Type 2s - &quot;buses&quot; for the uninitiated. 
&lt;'Obligatory Bus Content' requirement hereby satisfied&gt;) since 1954
(that's 44 years, for the mathematically challenged).  I suspect this
predates the birth of your parents.

&gt;I was playing around in the type2 archives and I found this post from
&gt;Hoover.  Reposting it under the circumstances will probably piss him
&gt;off, but it does bear repeating. It's something that we all should 
&gt;remember.
