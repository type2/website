I recently read a message concerning exhaust and gas odor.  I have this
problem also, specifically a raw gas odor intermittently.  I have a 70
transporter, with a rebuilt engine with a Weber carb (not sure of the
exact type), an oversized oil pan, and an external oil filter  (it takes
about 4.5-5.0 quarts of oil to fill).  The person I bought it from said
it was for a dune buggy.  It runs well, and when I took it to a mechanic
who does alot of work on VW's, he said not to touch it if it runs well,
not offering any solutions to my problem.  It also gets alot of oil blow
back, such that a new air filter will be oily only after several days. 
Any ideas?  Is this thing safe to drive?
