Subject: Security locks

The Bus Depot has the engine hatch locks. I just ordered one for our ''76. 
While at it, I also ordered a locking gas cap from them because the rubber 
seal on ours is chewed up and this may affect idling problems, according to 
the list wisdom.
Still looking for a &quot;club &quot; steering wheel lock _with the built in stun gun 
feature_, but can't find a source locally. Has anyone used one of these and 
how effective are they?
Please comment, and if you are/or know a dealer let us know. Than you. Bucket
