&gt; Hey everybody:
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone recommend a good source for metric hardware (nuts bolts, studs
&gt; etc).
&gt;
&gt; Whenever I replace a nut or bolt on my VW, I try to use stainless when it is
&gt; available. My hick town seems to have a fear of &quot;those damned foriegn sizes&quot;
&gt; and therfore the supply is minimal.

If a given replacement part isn't too expensive or bulky, buying two of them
will leave you better prepared for the inevitable &quot;next time.&quot; And when you use
that &quot;spare&quot; part, lay in a couple more. Not having to scurry for parts
simplifies repairs.
