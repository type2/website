&gt;Am I right to assume that this might lead to a loose valve seat eventually?

Maybe.  Some people claim that cracks in the exhaust ports are no 
problem.  Mark Stephens said this in fact (but then again he's out of 
business).  His documentation said that &quot;stress-relief&quot; cracks were normal 
and would appear quickly in new heads.  A friend of mine showed me a set of 
just-rebuilt heads from MSHP and they had several cracks in the exhaust 
ports.  I made sure there were none in my heads though - I picked them up 
in person.

My point is that while I don't believe cracks in the exhaust ports are 
normal, they might not be as bad of a sign as you think.  See if you can 
tell if they extend close to the seat area - if so, that's definitely trouble.
