Why not do both they are really simple and low in cost. I would also do an
oil pressure guage if I where you just so you have the full spectrum of what
is going on. The oil pressure and temp is one device at least in PADME it
was. and the cylinder head sensor was only a circular sensing guage that
mounted between the outerlip of the sparkplug and the external lip of the
cylinder head like a washer. Really easy and you get the full spectrum of
monitoring capabilities. At least that is my opinion. If I am wrong then
please someone correct me.

&gt; Greetings List!
&gt; We have been driving our rebuilt 78 Transporter now for about a week and
everything is excellent!  After witnessing first hand the abuse my cylinder
heads took from the overheating caused by the previous owner (missing engine
tin, lack of seal, three inches of dirt, debris and leaves packed into the
cooling fins etc.) I am very interested in installing some sort of
temperature guage and/or oil pressure guage in order to monitor the running
condition of the motor.  The &quot;dipstick check&quot; doesnt provide me a whole lot
of comfort.  I have reviewed the archives and library, but am still unclear
on the best/easiest method of accomplishing this task.  Someone suggests
that an oil pressure guage is all that is needed as it is directly related
to temperature.  Is this a safe assumption?  Should I install a cylinder
head temperature guage or an oil temperature guage?  As I am sure there are
many options available, I am very interested in hearing your suggestions.
Thanks in advance!
&gt;
&gt; Chad
