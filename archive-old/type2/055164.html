Subject: timing

&gt;Hello Everyone...Getting ready to time my 71 and I am a little unclear
&gt;whether I time to 5 deg (After Top Dead Center)....I was watching the Bug
Me
&gt;Video..and he says time the engine 7.5 deg (Before Top Dead Center)...If
&gt;someone could clear this up for me..that would be great..Thanks alot..Adam

It depends on the distributor.  If you still have the stock double diaphragm
dist then the timing at idle should be 5 deg after top dead center.  If you
have a single diaphragm or 009 dist then it's about 7 1/2 deg before tdc.
In any case check the total advance with the engine revved up to about 3000
rpm.  Total advance should never be more than about 30 deg!
