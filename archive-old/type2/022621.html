Subject: Ditto on the A/C removal
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Hi all-
     By coincidence, I was about to post the same note about needing sheet 
metal.  I have a 79 2.0 liter that had A/C.  Ii was partially removed when I 
got the bus- now I am removing the rest.  
    I too, have a large gaping hole on the driver's side of the motor where 
the compressor was.  I also need the piece of tin that goes under the motor 
on the passenger side.  If anyone has this stuff from a bus they are parting 
out- please advise. Have $$$ of course.
     Thanx
   Brian
