&gt; fell off (!). the woodruff key that holds it on is long gone. if you look at

&gt; a spot that looks like this  \_|
&gt; 
&gt; I don't have another woodruff key, so i dunno if it'll stay if i put it all
&gt; back (i doubt it).  will AVP's warranty cover this?? or will they give me
&gt; some runaround about improper installation. the engine has less than 200
&gt; miles on it. can i have a machinist try to fix it?? will i have to tear the
&gt; whole engine down??  please tell me i'm not up sh*t's creep without even a
&gt; turd for a paddle. It'll be bad enough even if they DO replace my longblock.

ouch!

this can be repaired without taking the engine apart if it is done
carefully by someone with the proper tools and knowledge.

a new kerf is cut 180degrees around the crank with a mill or power file.
 this has to be done very carefully to not damage the temper of the crank.

I would be more worried as to &quot;WHY&quot; did this happen, is the crank
inproperly hardened???  was the wrong size woodruff key??

why did this happen, kerfs are very very tough, never seen one actually
fail without cause.
