Subject: Bus Depot Now Hiring

--Hey, here's a chance for all you obnoxious, grousing bus depot detractors who've blathered to the list about all things personal business to work for some real change. 

--Quit your jobs and get in there. It's like the peace corp for busdrivers.

--Friday post! Pmail Responses! Flame suit on! Go!
