Subject: air bypass &amp; idle mixture settings for brazilian solex 30/31?

Hi, folks--

Some of you may remember the trouble I was having with 
the solex 30 pict 3 carb on my 1600 DP.  I finally got 
over my technological indignation and threw money at 
the problem: I have a shiny new Brazilian 30/31 carb 
sitting on my engine now.  

Now my problem is the slow process of bringing carb 
adjustments, timing, and whatnot back into sync after 
weeks and weeks of fiddling and lame attempts at fault-
finding.  I'm following the directions that came with 
the new carb, which are close but not exactly like the 
adjustment procedures for my old Solex 30 pict 3.

Timing's back where it should be, but I'm having a 
little trouble dialing in the carb.  [I have a vacuum 
advance distributor.]  It idles beautifully, but it's 
not right yet in the mid-to-upper range.

My question is: Does anyone out there have one of 
these, and if so,  how many turns out are your two 
adjustment screws set?  I've been through the archives 
and about once a year someone asks this question, but 
the answers never get archived, it seems. 

I realize your settings probably wouldn't work exactly 
on mine without some more fiddling, but I need a place 
to start [e.g., the 2 3/4 turns out rule of thumb for 
the idle mixture screw on the basic 30 pict 3].  
Otherwise, it's going to take me forever to chase the 
right setting down. [The settings out of the box didn't 
seem to work very well.]

Thanks in advance.
