Subject: Re: [T2] BB in vacuum line?

Hopefully no more BB's! The reason I asked is that I have read that if the
tank is filled to fast or overfilled that the cannister can get some liquid
fuel into it and turn the charcoal into a solid mass. Maybe not. Ill put it
on the long list of things to check/do.

Hey while were kind of on the subject of vacuum hoses. I bought 12mm and
14mm hoses from Pelican Parts. They are very thin and colapse under vacuum.
I tried them on the auxiliary air valve and they just didnt hold up. Any
idea if this is going to be a problem to find good hose?

&gt; The canister is just full of carbon granules and fumes pass through that's
&gt; all. Maybe a a lot of BBs could clog one. ;-)
