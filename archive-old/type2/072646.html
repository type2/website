&gt;        Well, hoping to get to the source of my many problems yesterday, I'm
&gt;out there fooling with the ignition switch. It seems like there is no
&gt;resistance when I turn the key forward anymore. Could I be lucky enough
&gt;that it is just the key portion that has went out on me? I'm not
&gt;familiar with the workings of the ignition switch. (BTW this is a 69
&gt;with the switch in the steering column and the locking wheel)
&gt;        This could be a coincidence, because unless I'm mistaken the &quot;key&quot; part
&gt;of the switch doesn't carry the electrical current through it, so I
&gt;could replace just the part of the switch that is down in the column
&gt;correct?


Ronnie: If this assembly is the same as the one on a '71 Westy, then all
the spring-back action occurs in the little electrical portion of the
switch.  If you aren't getting this pull back when you turn the key to the
start position, then do replace the electrical portion.

Good luck,

Jack
