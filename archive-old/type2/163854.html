Subject: Yikes - Paint is Expensive

I just stopped by the local auto body supply.  They priced matching
paint (77 chrome yellow) at $170/gallon.  There price for filling
primer and activator was more than I expected also, ~ $90 for both.
Anybody know of a realible source for these materials at a more
reasonable price?  Or am I just out of touch?

Thanks,
Ken
