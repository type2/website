&gt; Also, does anyone know the pulling capacity of a bus with a 2.0 litre
&gt; engine?

My hitch is rated at 110lbs tongue weight and 1100 max towing, but that
may be a limitation on the way it's mounted (using the rear bumper
mounts).

If anyone has a hitch rated higher than that, I'd like to know how it's
mounted. (on a '75)
