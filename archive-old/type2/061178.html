Subject: Re: Exhaust emission levels for a '71 type II

Oliver and the List,
	My Clymer VW manual (no flames, please...) lists exhaust emission
levels for most VWs up to '75... For a 1971 Type II, it lists the CO
level to be set between 1.5 and 3.0%. Higher than 3.0 is too rich, and
lower than 1.5 would be too lean, IMHO. I'd keep it just under 3.0% if
not right at it for my motor.
	The level of hydrocarbons... for all aircooled VW's, the hydrocarbon
level should be no higher than 400 parts per million (ppm). 

Hope that helps.

&gt; good healthy (not so lean as my valves won't last the winter) readout
&gt; percentage on the gas anylyser??
