Subject: Paint jobs

Spent quite a few years in the Navy. First 2 playing Boatswain Mate till 
I changed rates. My first ship was considered a Flag ship with all the 
fancy  military ceremonial decorations. We used to mix about 6 ounces of 
spar varnish with the a gallon of haze gray, deck gray, or boot topping 
for the nonskid. Left a permanent fresh waxed look and seemed to stand 
up to the salt air better than straight enamel. I wonder who the 
manufacture of that paint was? It would probably last forever on a bus 
here in the arid climate of Arizona.

In the US Navy, Painting is a full time job. Prep: knock off all rust and
old paint with chipping hammers, wire brush, paint with zinc chromate
(yellow) primer. Then multipe coats of oil based enamel in various 
shades of
grey depending on the objects being painted. Both brushes and rollers are
used....never sprayed. It seems to preserve the metal and prevent 
rust...but
it doesn't look nice and smooth like a car body. But, it could have been 
wet
sanded and polished to look that way if needed.
