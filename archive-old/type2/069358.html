Subject: Paintjobs...

Hey all,
        About a week ago, I posted a question about paintjobs.  I received
several great responses...THANKS!  I even received a response from
someone who was interested in posibly working on the bus....BUT,
I seem to have lost the message.  If that person reads this, PLEASE get
back to me.  Thank you.
