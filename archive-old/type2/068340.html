Subject: RE: Shift lever

Hello all,

        I am looking for the shifter for a '77 Bus. Can anyone tell me what years I can use? Also, 
I don't know how much of the mechanism I will need. If I find one at a junkyard, should I take 
everything to the tranny or can I stop right under the floor up front? There is currently a Scat 
shifter in there and I don't know how much of the original it replaced. Any help will be greatly 
appreciate.
