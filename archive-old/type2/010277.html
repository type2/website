With less than 2 weeks to go until Busses by the Trail, things are starting to come 
together!

Last time I called Blue Rocks Campground, we had about 30 or so vehicles coming with 
more people holding out for the weather report and signing up last minute.

We talked to the folks at Clover Hill Vineyards to let them know we were coming for 
wine tasting during the caravan with 20-30 vehicles and they said no problem.  Given 
that Leaser Lake has been drained to fix the damn dam a second time in 10 years, we 
decided to have the caravan late morning and have our picnic at Clover Hill.  I got 
some brochures and wine lists to put in the handout bags, but if you want to check 
out their offerings, see &lt;http://www.cloverhillwinery_dot_com/&gt;.  Bring your picnic 
lunch, corkscrew and a blanket.

Bring your electric space heaters...we've been getting frost at night.  All sites 
should have electric.  Bring a 3-prong splitter just in case.  Also, bring firewood 
if you have any.  We have some big logs, but small to medium-sized stuff would be 
good.


The very cool T-shirts (if I do say so myself) arrived today.  We decided to emulate 
the colors from Busses by the Buoy this year (the Buoy shirts were a very nice 
design, BTW); that is, cream-colored shirt with VW blue print.  The logo is the same 
as the one on the BBTT web page, courtesy of Dave at &lt;http://www.251_dot_org&gt;.  The shirt 
is Fruit of the Loom 100% cotton.

We only printed a limited number of shirts (especially sizes M and XXL), so if you 
want to reserve one, please let me know ASAP.  They'll be $10 at the campout.  I've 
already had some mail order requests, which will be the same price plus $3.20 
Priority Mail shipping to US addresses regardless of the number of shirts.

So far I have:

L&amp;A Johnson: 1M, 1L
Caston/Payne: 1XL, 1M
Cort: XL or L and 2S &lt;- Joel, I didn't get S; M is the smallest
Doss: 1 XXL
Mourkas: 1XL

Proceeds go to cover our cost of the event (food, etc.) since we're not collecting a 
registration fee.  Any surplus will be donated to LiMBO.

It's not too late to sign up.  Call Blue Rocks Campgound 610-756-6366 and reserve your 
spot.
