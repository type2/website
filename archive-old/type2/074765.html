Subject: sceond battery ... or the xpower600?

--part1_106.c564f1b.2989cb66_boundary

I was in Sam's Club today and spotted this gizmo:

http://www.statpower_dot_com/xPower600.htm

I was about to install a second battery in my '71 (even bought the relay from 
Bus Depot), but this looks like it might be a better gimmick.

It recharges principally with AC, but can be recharged with its DC/cigarette 
lighter adapter, too (as long as the car's running).

It was about $140 at Sam's.

Thoughts?
