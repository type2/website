Nick:
I'm not so sure that that is such a concern. I've seen a few front end crashed
type 2's but never any that were that serious. Maybe I started looking in
junkyards too late, 1982 or so. I think the lack of crashed vehicles is
probably due to several factors, evasive capability and  better driver
position being two. But I think the single most responsible factor might be
natural selection of the users (type 2 Darwinism!).
Though type 2's tend to appeal to the same general group of people that like
other finely engineered German stuff like Porsches and Audis, most of us are
either past that period of our lives (not me- still crazy after all these
years), or at least under no misperceptions about  our type 2's BEING Porsches
and therefore use them more or less as they were designed to be used.
As far as losing your legs: This is one reason a 70 or later is a little bit
better car than a 69 or earlier. There is quite a bit more structure under the
floor and beams in the doors beginning in 1970. the owners manual say they
weigh 200lbs more in front. I'm not sure how much actually, but do know the
torsion bars are different (stiffer).
