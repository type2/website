&gt; Bus folks,
&gt; There's a hint of fall in the air that has brought about memories of cold
&gt; extremities last winter in the '68 crewcab.  The PO used what looks like
&gt; some flexible exhaust pipe to connect between the heater boxes and body
&gt; heater tubes.  This solution is noisy and the tubes don't seal very well.  I
&gt; called BusBoys for the replacement plastic bellows-type connectors and Bill
&gt; said they don't have them.  He said that they are a couple inches longer
&gt; than the bug connectors and he doesn't know of anyone who has them.  RMMW
&gt; doesn't list them in their catalog, but I haven't called them yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Are these really scarce?  Should I expect it to be a dealer only item?
&gt; Anybody have any other recommended sources?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Dean

I saw some advertised in J.C. Whitney. Don't know how they work though.
