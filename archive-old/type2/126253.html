Subject: Re: [T2] Re: MORE paint questions

Hi Larry,

The last bus I painted with a roller deserved it. It was a 20/20 job... 
It looked good at twenty paces or while driving by at 20 MPH. It did 
look a hell of a lot better afterwards than it did before. And it 
lasted about 4 seasons, after which the bus was completely shot and 
ready for the boneyard. I am still driving parts of it that were 
transferred to the westfakia in the summer of 2000.

&lt;soap box mode on&gt;

I think of it this way: If it's *my* bus I can paint it whatever way I 
damn well please. There won't ever be a &quot;next owner&quot; for the westfakia 
if I have anything to say about it, but besides that:  Living with the 
consequences of one's actions is the price of being an adult.

If I had my life to live over maybe I wouldn't have pushed a piston 
through the top of the case on the 914 engine in my 72 westy when I was 
25. But I did and that engine is done and gone. That bus was also 
painted with tremclad -- I live in the rust belt and it was already 
crusty when I got it in 1986. The tremclad made it marginally 
presentable and helped me get a few more years out of it, years that 
indelibly drove a love of baywindows into my psyche. I did get a quote 
on a professional job, it would have cost me a couple months of pay 
that I just could not afford to invest back then.

Everything we do has consequences. But I'm not going to miss sleep over 
a paint-job.

If you can't afford to repaint a tremclad encrusted bus properly there 
are two options:
1. Find another bus.
2. Throw another coat of tremclad at it.

As long as what I do with my bus is not putting someone else at risk, 
it's really none of their business.

&lt;/Soap box mode off&gt;

Flame suit engaged.

Happy trails,

&gt; I hope those of you who are thinking of painting some or all of your 
&gt; Bus
&gt; with a roller realize that if you (or the next owner) ever want to do 
&gt; the
&gt; job right it will cost twice as much or more because the whole Bus will
&gt; have to be stripped to bare metal.
