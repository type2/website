Subject: Re: Backup lights

The backup light switch is located on the front of the transmission on the
drivers side. Its not hard to find because it is the only thing on the
trans that has wires coming out of it. Run along the two wires and make
sure that they are all good. The switch fits just like a brake light
switch on the master cylinder (just screws on with a wrench).I am not sure
about price because I have never had to replace this before.

&gt; So,
&gt; I have tail lights and turn signals, but no backup lights. The fuses are all 
&gt; good and the bulbs are not burnt out, so where do I go now? Is there a 
&gt; switch, that gets engaged when I move the shifter into reverse, that may be 
&gt; haywire? If so, where is it located and how do I access it? I looked in the 
&gt; Bentley and Muir books, but found no information on what to do.
&gt; 
&gt; This vehicle is a '75 bus  with an Automatic trans.
