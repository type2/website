&gt; My '78 2.0L fuel injected Bus won't start.  It turns over, fires, runs for
&gt; two seconds then dies.  If I give it gas it will idle high for ~6 seconds
&gt; and then will die independent of my right foot.  It has gas in the tank.
&gt; I can repeat this indefinitely.
	[]  It sounds like it is running for a few seconds on the cold start
valve, or fifth injector.
	This is completely independent of the rest of the FI system, , just
controlled by a little time/temperature controlled relay called the Thermal
Time Switch. So it is possible that for some reason your FI 
	system isn't functional. Probably a bad ground, or bad connections
somewhere.
	Put a test lamp across your one of your injector plugs, and see if
the light flickers on when you crank the engine. 
	If not, your main injectors are not firing.
