Subject: Stewart Warner 8332-12 Bus heater for sale

Hello all,
I have a used Stewart Warner gas heater model # 8332-12volt for a bus for 
sale.
Was working when removed from the PO vehicle.  Needs the ductwork and the 
control cable/switch.  You can use dryer vent ductwork for the ducting and 
the calbe/switch is available from various sources.
Came out of a beetle if you can believe it.  PO had it behind the driver's 
seat.
I also have a photocopy of the manual for the heater which is included.
I am looking to get $150 for it or the best offer.
Get a heater for your bus before the snow flies.
Al
