Subject: Re: [T2] Best camper top?

Obviously, your choice will depend on you.

I really liked being able to stand up in my bus at any time, without popping
the top. But the downside is weight and added wind resistance.

The best argument for the original Westy tops is parts will be available for
a while. Especially canvas and seals. Parts for rivis, dormobiles, etc, may
or may not be around... Of course, a high top won't need any of that
stuff... heh
