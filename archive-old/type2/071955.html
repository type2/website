&gt;Well, I've never had a Yokohama or even a cheapo Hercules peel its

&gt;
&gt;So, let's expand our data.  Has anyone had any non-Michelin tires come
&gt;apart?  Perhaps the Michelin failures is simply a me-too thing with a
&gt;popular brand, much like the Ford Pinto debacle.

Okay.  I've had one tire fail on me - the entire tread came off of the tire
in one piece and I was left driving on sidewalls and steel belts.  The
tire?  Michelin XV 185/70/14.  To it's credit the tire was still holding
air.  I ran two or three pairs of these tires on my bus before the above
incident, and I also noticed that they wore out rather quickly.  I usually
bought them used, with about 1/2 tread left, and got 10,000 miles or less
out of them.

On the good end of the spectrum we had some Michelin XZX's on a Renault (4?
The one with the engine in the rear) and ran them for 60,000 miles - they
still had tread left and never gave us any trouble, BUT they were also on a
very light car.

I've since run on my bus Yokohama Y371 (great tire), Tujungal (great tire),
Sears Trailhandler AT (poor stability) and currently GoodYear Wrangler AT's
(noisy but handle great) and none have failed.  From my viewpoint, the
Michelin XV is an inferior tire for a bus.
