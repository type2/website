Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition timing 

I forgot to add that I use a 009 distibutor.

GE 2 liter, Dual Del carb, etc......

So, what is the correct way to time this thing? 

Over the years, I have tried different timings with my bus. I've run 10 
advanced, and 10 retarded...at idle. I get a little more umph in the city and 
stuff when it is advanced, but running it retarded really gave me fairly good 
gas milage and good top end. (Cruising easily at 70-80),etc., while still 
running rather cool.
