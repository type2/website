Subject: [T2] why can't I time it by the book?

Kind volks,

My bus won't run if timed by the book (Haynes)

1974 1800
engine AW014731
dist. 231 181 005
duel solex
manual trans.

book says 5deg ATDC _at_ 900 rpm w hoses on.  Is this correct?

It won't run at all this way.  I currently have it at about 5deg BTDC
and even this seems too retarded (lacks power.)

Can you tell from this what's wrong or what I should check?  If so, I'll
be forever in your debt.

Your most humble and obedient servant,

Jim
