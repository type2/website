Subject: Thermostat issues

Last year, I discovered 2 aircooled VW thermostats (one type 1 and one
type 4) in my local import FLAPS. It was not even in his computer system
because they've been there forever. He sold them to me for the original
price of ~$14 each. So, I install the type 4 stat. I ran the engine until
it got up to temp, then removed the slack out of the cable, so when the
thermostat cooled, it pulled the flaps shut.

One year later, the thermostat is expanded and no longer works. It was
in good physical condition when I installed it a year ago and when
I removed it the other day (except for being expanded).

So, now I install my type 1 thermostat. But this time I follow the
instructions on http://www.germansupply_dot_com, which is while the engine
is cool, close the flaps and secure the cable, so that as the engine
warms, the thermostat expands allowing the flaps to open, which they
do fully.

I'm a little baffled why the type 4 thermostat failed so quickly.
Is it possible that the technique I used to set the cable  caused the
failure?  The way I did it, as the thermostat cooled and retracted the
cable, it is possible the thermostat was never able to fully collapse
and it possibly stayed slightly extended.  The way I set my current
thermostat is it stays completely collapsed while the engine is cool.
I did verify that the flaps completely open when the engine is at temp.
Thoughts?
