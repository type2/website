Subject: RE: air-conditioning for a '71?

Bob and Penny Lee inquire as to the best way of getting a bigger engine,
and (subsequently? consequently? also!) air-conditioning, in a 71 bus.
I think that a Porsche engine in a 71 would in some ways be even neater
than a Porsche engine in a Vanagon, but not if getting more than 18mpg is
part of the plan.

I hope that B&amp;P won't take this as slander, but the right approach for some
people might be to get an 89 Club Wagon, with the big six and the air.
It's real important to *respect* every car you own, but you don't need to 
*love* all of them.  Which is to say they don't all have to be German, air-
cooled, and over 15 years old.
