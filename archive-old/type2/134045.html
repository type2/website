Subject: oil sump screen

does anyone know the specs (part #, overall size, etc?) on the oil 
pump screen that fits the aluminum basket cases?   i have a bucket of 
36, 40 and 1600 screens - including some truly awful-looking 
brazilian ones that more resemble a hair net - but none fit the 
pickup tube properly. the one that came with the crapcase wont allow 
me to use a drain plug sump cover... not sure if any screen will.
