That sounds wrong. The part number is N 020 112 1 and is listed as A14 size.
You can get OEM lug nuts for less than $2 each. Since they are the only
things holding the wheels on...you know the lecture. ;-)

I believe A14 to be equivalent to M14 x 1.5 pitch that fits a 19mm socket.

Does anyone know what A14 means?
