&gt;Greetings All:
&gt;I would like to have suggestions from anyone 
&gt;concerning a problem we are having with 68 
&gt;Bus.  It is very diffcult to find 1st and 2nd 
&gt;gear.  When we can get the transmission in 
&gt;1st or 2nd it works fine and shifts into gear 
&gt;with no grind or other noise.  It almost 
&gt;appears as a linkage problem.  The clutch is 
&gt;fully disengaged and all other gears are 
&gt;normal.
&gt;Any Suggestions?
&gt;Thanks, Gene Nichols

Gene, although I've never encountered this 
problem, many have and the usual cure is said to 
lie in the shift guide plate under the lever. 
It's a gate like template that guides the 
movement of the linkage.  It is said that the 
plate frequently comes loose but may become 
severely worn.  Your symptom sounds like it may 
be incorrectly positioned.  Do not, however, over 
look the coupler just at the front (FIF) of the 
transmission cover. It must be tight and safety 
wired.
