&gt; I would think that as long as you had enough fluid in the tranny, no harm no
&gt; foul. I've pulled 'em a long way on both bar or dolly (last one from Fresno
&gt; to Victoria) and only took it slow on the 66 in respect for the RGB. I've
&gt; never had a transaxle problem on a VW.


problem with an automatic is that there is a pump that circulates the
fluid, the manual has a splash type of lube system.  unless the engine is
running the pump doesn't turn so the tranny gets little or no lube in the
front end.   
   the final drive is essentially identical to the manual, and uses 90wt
tranny oil, but it is seperated from the tranny physically and the auto 
tranny does have a seperate lube system and some of it does spin with the
final drive and that part gets no lube with the engine off.

    The manual tranny is a one piece casting with a bolt on bell
housing. the Auto tranny is a two piece with the tranny one part and the
final drive/bell housing the other part.  I don't know how much of the
final drive is interchangable.  even the half shafts are a different
length.

&gt; &gt; Rick, Mike:
&gt; &gt; Huh? I guess from the thousands of miles that I flat-towed buses, Vanagons
&gt; &gt; and Porsches (356 and 911), I'd have known about this!
&gt; &gt; I SAY that there is nothing wrong with towing a MANUAL TRANSMISSION type 2
&gt; &gt; with the axles in. NOT an automatic!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Mike,
&gt; &gt; &gt; its my guess that the rule of not towing a Bus with
&gt; &gt; &gt; the drive shafts connected would hold true for a bug
&gt; &gt; &gt; b/c we have the same principles working in the tranys.
