Look at the shift rod coupler at the transmission end of the shift rod. 
  If the rectangular bushings on each side of the cage are worn out, 
then there could be significant slop, preventing proper engagement of 
the various gears.  Judging from your symptom (gears that work are on 
the bottom of the H-pattern), I would definitely make an effort to rule 
out shift linkage problems before swallowing hard and doing the 
transmission itself.

If the rear shift rod coupler is what's wrong, I think the EMPI 
replacement is probably a good bet ... it seems to be better made than 
the Mexican version.
