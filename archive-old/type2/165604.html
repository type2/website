&gt;Well it gets weird after the door switch.  I would
&gt;THINK that the switch should just go to ground from
&gt;there...but the wire from the switch (solid grey) goes
&gt;to fuse box and connects to the back side of a relay
&gt;socket (the socket is empty).

I think you'll find that wire is for the key in/door open buzzer. It 
should get grounded along with the lamp wire when the door is opened. 
The switch itself is screwed into ground.

If the switch isn't working, take some emery cloth or even a knife and 
gently clean the contacts.
