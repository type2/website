&gt; I kept trying to start it.
&gt; It would fire and die as soon as I stop running the starter.

&gt; fuel filter is a month old.

I would still check it
sure sounds like a fuel feed problem, what kind of engine, carb/FI??
did you just fill up the tank??  could have gotten a bad batch of fuel too

the FLAPS has some gas line dri stuff that I have heard helps with the
water, remember water is heavier than gas and will be at the very bottom
of your fuel tank, where the inlet is

&gt; Fuel Pump?

could be pump, do you have mechanical or electrical type

&gt; Coil?

less likely but certainly possible

good luck
