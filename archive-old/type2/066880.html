Subject: Where we want to go in our VW

This is an answer to the mail of Rusty VanBondo. And it's a mail to tell 
you our plan for next summer too.

My young brother is gonna a buy a westy in a few days. He like mine, so 
he want one too. Two friends of me got westy too. So we are four '72 - 
'78 westys from Quebec that want to make a big trip next summer.

We plan to leave Quebec in the beggining of may. And we have four month 
to have fun on the road.

We probably want to go to LA (we have on friend there), probably want to 
see mexico. But we don't know where (near from LA). I have done this trip 
next summer with a friend in an old ford escort break '82. about 8000 
milles in 40 days. Now I want to make it in my van!

We have to pass by Okanagan valley (near Vancouver, canada) to find a 
little job to have a little bit money).

And after that, anywhere.

I'm gonna tell you more about this project later.

I want to make a map of North-America to see where exactly live all the 
people of the type2list. See later!

There is a another thing that I wanna know and about what you can help 
me. What are the important event for type2 next summer. Where and When? 
If you have answer for me it can really help us to planning our trip.

Thanks!
