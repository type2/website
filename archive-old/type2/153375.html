Grupp, What is the correct nut size for the rocker shaft to head stud on my
'75 Westy, also, is the extra length of the Hydraulic lifter pushrod over the
solid lifter pushrod, taken up by the hydraulic lifter?  ( I am changing from
solids to hydraulic on this engine rebuild, 1.8 Litre) Also, my pressure plate
is attached to flywheel with 6mm (bolt head / wrench size) socket head bolts,
is this the way it is supposed to be attached?  Thank you for your help.
Sid
