Subject: Re: [T2] decibel

&gt; that was my first question, a good condition stock exhaust should not 
&gt; be that loud. and a Westy has good insulation. 

It is a stock exhaust, appears to be in good condition, no changes noticed by me in the last 2 years, however I did drag it a tiny bit on some sand last summer and my BIL said that he noticed a change in the sound when i did it and that it got louder, no visible damage, and 7 days ago it was in a VW shop getting a thorough tune-up and inspection, no mention of damaged exhaust.

How should I replace it?  Quiet is more important than performance, as long as it doesn't mean a hotter motor.

&gt; I would check the pad over the engine, but you also have a mattress up 
&gt; there for sound deadening yes?? 

I do have a matress, but I put a small rubber mat under it for kneeling behind the bus and noticed a change in the noise, I will be covering the entire surface with the horse stall mat and measuring the change.

I might also attach sound deadening mat with and without the horse stall mat to see what I get.

I drove my bus with the closet door open, and nothing in the closet, made my vision blur.

We have hundreds of pounds of sorbethane drops at work that are free, I am trying to figure out how to use it, sheets with 3&quot; holes missing and about 1-1/2&quot; rounds.
