Subject: Re: [T2] New member - Question (Battery Isolator)

Yup, found the regulator near the right back firewall.
I believe I have learned more about the electrical system of this van
then I ever thought possible for my brain.

a) remove all crap from alternator and put on post 1 on isol. (batt 1)
b) remove regulator line D+ from Alternator and attach to post 1 on isol. 
(batt 1)
c) attach line between alternator and isolator (middle post on isol.)
d) attach line from alternate battery to post two on isolator (batt 2)

Make sure your alternate battery is well charged up before you connect.
Supposed to extend the life of the deep cycle battery in case it doesn't 
come
fully charged from the dealer.

Background info. Since this is an batt isolator capable of handling 95 amps 
I don't
need to worry about the connections being two small or two large (ie gauge 
of wire).
The isolator won't overheat unlike a relay would handling the throughput.

&gt;i just realized my snafu - i was thinking of the voltage
&gt;regulator on the 73 Super Beetle i used to have.
