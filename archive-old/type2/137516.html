Subject: Re: [T2] Scale for balancing?

Last time I did any balancing I was many years ago when I was working at a 
&quot;quickie mart&quot; place.  I didn't have a scale, didn't know anyone with a scale,
and was more-or-less broke.  The manager had an electronic money-counter
accurate enough to tell when there's 49 pennies in a roll instead of 50 .

Remembering Muir's bit about how a quarter weights &quot;X&quot; grams, I brought in 
my pistons &amp; dremel one graveyard-shift evening and balanced 'em on that,
using the &quot;dimes&quot; setting.  Don't know how much they weighed in *grams*,
but I figured if they're all the same &quot;amount&quot; of dimes it'd be close enough.
