Subject: Re: [T2] Nice California Westy

I will second that. You can get decent busses for cheap, even off of eBay.

I bought my 76 westfalia last year from someone just north of San Francisco 
for $410.

Granted, I put money into it, but I drove it home and around town for two 
months beforehand. It was running and ready to go.

Of course, it helped that they posted no pictures, no description other than 
&quot;sleeps 4&quot; and spelled it 'wesphalia'

I drove up to check it out, and sat up till the auction ended at 4am to make 
sure I was the high bidder.
