Subject: Looking at purchasing 1971:  Question on Body Work Costs

I am looking at a 71 Deluxe purchase and found the following body problems
in the body.  I want to have the body work done and was wandering if anybody
would care to estimate what it wold cost to fix the following:

Also wandering if people think that this is small amount of body work or
not.

2 bad areas under the windshield
some rust at front seat belt anchors
some rust in driver/front wheel wheel
rocker behing driver crushed in for about 2 feet
each rear corner some dents
engine lid small dent
front roof small dent
sliding door some scrape/dent as well as panel after slider.

Any guesses appreciated.  Trying to decide if I want to tackle this one.

- Mark
