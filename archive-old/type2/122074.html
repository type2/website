Subject: Re: [T2] Burnt bus fund

I've said it several times. Check the archives. Any bus can be made 
perfectly reliable. Over the long haul, properly maintaining a bus 
(whether by oneself or with the help of a competent mechanic) is one of 
the most cost-effective ways to have reliable transportation.

The dangers of rotten gas lines -- especially where they pass through 
the front tin -- are not publicized enough. Everyone on this list 
should make it a habit to remind everyone about this flaw of age. When 
someone posts one the common questions (&quot;how do I reupholster my front 
seats?&quot;) the answer should be: it's easy, but first: how are your fuel 
lines?

Mark &quot;when's the last time you checked your fuel lines?&quot; Hineline
