Subject: Electicity while stopped

List ,
Advise Please,

I have a 73 Westy and after reading about the newer Westy's with
electricity available while they are parked. I'm wondering how I would
be able  to watch TV or heat up water for coffee, while either running
the engine or stopped.  I have a feeling this maybe very simple, but I
can't work it out. I have no cigarette lighter or power source like
that.
Any ideas out there?
Thanks for the help

George A
