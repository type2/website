I agree (metoo! metoo!) except that I would state it this way: #1 will be
at TDC 180 degrees of clockwise rotation after the intake valve for #1 has
closed.  The intake and exhaust valves will both be closed when the engine
is 360 degrees out of its proper firing point (at the end of the exhaust
stroke) as well, but the car will not fire there. Unless you are Superman
or otherwise possessed of X-ray vision the only way to determine when a
long-block or other unknown engine is at TDC for #1 is to remove the
right-hand valve cover and rotate the engine until you see the #1 intake
valve close.  Once you have seen that valve close then rotate the engine
another 180 degrees and you will be close to TDC for #1.

                             OOK!
