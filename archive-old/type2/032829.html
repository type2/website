Subject: Oh, to pass emissions

Hello all,
 Its about time i take my bus to get its yearly inspection and emission 
stickers. I'm not worried about the inspection, but i'm always somewhat 
nervous about our enhanced emission standard. Last year i passed on my second 
try after holding the RPMs high for a few minuets.
        Since then i have replaced my pistons and rings, and have found a 
small crack in one exhaust valve seat. A really good mechinist that i know 
told me not to worry about it for another year or two, and said it shouldn't 
even effect my compression. Unfortuantly, i have yet to get a compression 
tester, so i havn't checked that yet.
       From what i hear, adding 10% ether alcohol to a tank should clear 
emissions up somewhat. Does anybody know how effective this is? And where i 
should get some?
