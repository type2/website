Hi Volks,
    If anyone is from the Flint, MI area, please tell me, is there support
in that area for a 79 bus?
My son plans on attending Kettering University in Flint and will probably
need an automobile due to the work study program they have at that school.
I was thinking of getting the 79 bus running and on the road for him, but
with Michigan being the heart of the U.S. auto industry maybe I should just
get him a F#rd or Ch#vy.
    No sense to use the list to answer so just p-mail me at    type2_at_msn_dot_com


Thanks

Paul

Huntington Station,(Long Island) NY

71 Westy - as yet unnamed

77 bus - Ol' Red

79 bus - brown bear
