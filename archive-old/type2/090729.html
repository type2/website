Subject: Re: [T2] Gettin' ready for a TRIP

very cool trip chris. I live just 30 minutes from the beginning (or
end) near Nashville. Depending when you start your trip, there is a
small place to eat right at the beginning. &quot;The Loveless Cafe&quot; has
great country ham &amp; biscits. I haven't taken the trip in a bus before,
but it seems like a great idea. Unless things have changed the speed
limit is 55 (nice bus speed) &amp; the entire pathway is littered (in the
good sence) with many stops that contain information about america
during the pioneer days. One other tip is to pay attention to your gas
consumption. There are many exits which are no where near anything
that remotely resembles a gas station :)
