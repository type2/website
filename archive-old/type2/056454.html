Subject: '71 front axle beam, Pacific Grove Rolling Concours

	Folks,
	I've come to believe that I will never swap the '71 front axle
with disc brakes for the stock '70 drum brakes in our single cab, Little 
Martha. And we'd have to swap the rear brakes for the later pattern 
wheels or carry two spares too. Too complicated. Sooo, here's a nice '71 
front axle, with calipers, rotors, master cylinder resivior, etc, etc, 
just as I got it from the PO 4 years ago. 
	$50 or best offer.  408 451 3278 days,  510 594 1567 nights
We live in North Oakland, just off highway 13. I drive to work in San
Jose five days a week, so delivery is possible.

	We're taking our single cab to the Pacific Grove Rolling 
Concours again this year- wash and wax division, if we get time for
the wax :) Hang out with people who actually DRIVE their really 
cool old cars on the road- we won't be the only aircooled VW but
we were the only Type 2 last year. The event is on Friday, August 14,
kicking-off the old-car weekend in Monterey/Carmel/Pacific Grove.
This year's driving part will be through Del Monte forest, on 17 mile
drive. In a '70 single cab, among the Ferarris, ALFAs, MGs &amp; Porsches :)
I recomend it- and the barbeque dinner afterwards.

	Cheers!
	Bill
