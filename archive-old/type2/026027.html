Subject: Re: [T2] my tire rack

abeck_at_nt.sympatico_dot_ca sends:

&gt; It appears my tire rack was allowed to poke through the front of the
&gt; Van. I also assume this was caused by either &quot;Bondo&quot; or metal
&gt; fatigue.
&gt; 
&gt; As a result, does anyone have any suggestions on how to make it
&gt; stronger? Perhaps having a bar welded across the unibody chassis
&gt; and then I bolt the tire rack directly to that, bypassing the body
&gt; itself?
&gt; 
&gt; Can I remove the front facia of my bus?

The majority here says to take the tire rack off the front and put the spare
back in the spare well (that's inside the Bus) because in an accident,
you're safer with the spare not on the front.

You can get new noses for Buses, and if you've got the cash this is the way
to go.
