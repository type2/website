&gt;Hello listers,

&gt;My '77 Westy is in need if a quality exhaust. I currently have an Empi
&gt;Monza style that has rusted to pieces in 7 months. I would like
&gt;something that is good quality, preferably stainless steel. It also must
&gt;be as quiet as possible, I did the no baffle stinger thing when I was
&gt;18. Can someone recommend a good system from heater boxes back?
&gt;

Kenny, can you say &quot;Original Equipment Manufacturer&quot;? 

Stainless could be considered an enhancement of materials, but the
backpressure charcteristics should not vary much from stock. It is a
condition of spec stock motor harmony, and it can upset efficient function. 

Short range driving adds lots of condensed water to the muffler. If this is
the case, drill a small hole at the bottom of each end, just big enough
that you can use a piece of bailing wire to clear it from time to time. The
less H2O building up from short run daily commute drives only, the longer
the muffler will last.  In these extreme use conditions, you will see
gorilla snot buildup in the crankcase breather system and the oil fill tube
and cap, and even on the inside of the valve covers. That is an emulsion of
liquid water and the detergents in the oil. If at any time the oil on the
dipstick looks milky, change immediatly. Water is a very poor high temp
lubricant, and dropplets are forming overnight and being sucked into the
oil pickup upon morning startup.

Stay away from German Wagner junk as supplied by NAPA and others. One of
the few examples of junk of anykind actually made in the Paterland but
obviously contrary to any principle of the Deutsches Methode (see
archives).  They must have Easties slapping them together who are
relearning to weld while having also fogotten what a jig is. Did Wagner buy
an old E. Paterland plant thinking they needed no other direction in its
operation, as long as it provides a Mutterland profit 'cause they keep the
costs low as well by not wasting money on inspectors? NAPA, too, as to
inspection? Did they all skip pre-Euclidian geometry indoctrination in the
pre-schools? Both here and in E. Paterland?

For any muffler, at the counter, befor you pay, put a straight edge on the
flages and eyeball them for alinement. A quality welded flange, and all
welds for that matter, will have a small uniform bead, and not restrict the
corners of the mounting nuts. It will be dead on jig welded. Even it may
need some 'massage' to fit a rebuilt motor that has moved the port studs
from questionable milling/adjustment procedures. Note also that no quality
muffer uses materials so thin that you can dimple it by just pressing hard
on the side with the heal of your hand. That is the $19.95 junk for one
summer dune buggy use.
