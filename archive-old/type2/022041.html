Although not reported as a problem on a bus, this 
sounds very much like a problem I had on my previous 
bus.
In my case it was not only loosing top speed but was 
stugling (more than usual) on hills.
As a temporary measure I took the fuel in line off of 
the pump and blew down it using my electric tyre pump.
I was then able to drive normaly.
As a permanent fix I changed the fuel lines, drained the 
tank and cleaned the in tank strainer.
As I had no further problems I put this down to a partial 
blockage in the fuel lines either due to dirt, rust or 
rubber.

Good luck

&gt;Hi, I have a question on behalf of a friend who drives 
a '65 beetle. Over the 
&gt;weekend, he brought his beetle all the way from 
indiana to canada. anyway, on 
&gt;his way back, he started having trouble driving fast on 
the interstate. as he 
&gt;went on, his maximum speed kept dropping till he was 
cruising at 40mph (no 
&gt;longer on the interstate by then). he did change is fuel 
filter and checked 
&gt;his fuel pump (which seems okay). what he did notice 
is some rust in the old 
&gt;fuel filter which could be from the fuel tank. does 
anybody have any idea 
&gt;where the problem could be and a way to tap the 
problem? all advice are 
&gt;welcome! thanks
&gt;
&gt;kh
