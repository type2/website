Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Towing a Campermobile with a Vanagon?

I know this won't change anybodys minds on this, but have you ever done the
figures on what a semi tractor weighs in comparison to what it tows?  Here
in Kansas, it is legal on the interstates for a single axle semi tractor to
pull 3 full sized LOADED semi trailers!!!!

Being an old farm boy, I know some of the things we do that people would
cringe at are indeed MUCH safer than the way many people drive in a normal
fashion.

Safety does not just mean equipment but has to be coupled with attitude and
common sense.


&gt;&gt; Sorry Rick I can't agree with you.  &quot;All of the safety measures&quot; would
&gt; include having a capable tow
&gt;&gt; vehicle.  I think you would agree that a drum-braked 3000lb splittie with a
&gt; 50hp engine does not
&gt;&gt; qualify.
&gt; 
&gt; I would have to agree with this as well. I have often pondered over what
&gt; possess people to tow heavy objects with a 50hp motor on a 3000 pound
&gt; vehicle...Personally, I would never consider that as option and I would
&gt; barely consider it using my 2003 Mazda B3000...which has a V6 in it and
&gt; weighs around 3500 pounds.
