Subject: Re: [T2] Re: inverter

&gt;While were on this subject, does anyone know if the galley light above the
&gt;sink runs through the converter? Just wondering because on the motorhome I
&gt;used to own all of the lights would run off of shore power when connected.
&gt;It would be nice to have a couple more lights wired up to the converter and
&gt;not have to worry about draining the batteries. I wonder, would the stock
&gt;converter be able to handle the extra AMPS?

When you are hooked up to shore power, anything that runs off of the aux 
battery is powered by battery charger.

I believe on the late bays it is still powered off of the main starting 
battery.
