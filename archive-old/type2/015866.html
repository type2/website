&gt;Hmmm...now I'm not the brightest person with this theoretical stuff, so
please bear with me: Why would VW have decided to reduce the size of the
intake valve head between the 1800 and the 2000? 

My personal opinion is that the 41mm valve in the 1800 was simply too
large.  Valve size is a sophisticated science with many, many
considerations such as flow patterns, port velocity, shrouding,
relationship to lift, and on and on.  

Assuming something like &quot;Smaller valves make less power&quot; will get you into
trouble when building engines.
