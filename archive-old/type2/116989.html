Subject: re: '71 intermittent problem

Hmm,  Intermiddent problems can be a real hassle to diagnose.  Ok, so it
dies once it a while, and won't re-start right away?

I take it you've timed everything properly with a proper light?  My next
question would be when this problem actually occurs.  Do you find it's when
accelerating, or going up a hill, or when the van is vibrating a lot?  Is
it possible there's a loose connection somewhere that comes off when it's
bouncing around enough?  Also your gas filter is clean, and the engine is
getting a good supply of fuel?  The battery is connected well the ground to
the body is solid?  Is your van over-heating perhaps?  Also when you touch
the oil dipstick, it's not so frigging hot that it burns your hand to touch
it?

I know this is the obvious stuff, but sometimes these things get
over-looked.  If some stuff doesn't apply, well don't worry about it and
think about what does.

Good luck,
Shawn.
