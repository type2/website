     BTW,  I think that many people might find they get better
performance by trying higher priced gasoline brands than higher-octane.
I never thought there was much difference until I moved to Mobile, AL.
      Up north, all the gas stations have to be pretty careful about
keeping water out of their gas, because if you fill up, then have gas
line freeze shortly after, you can make them pay the towing and fix-it
fee. Not so down south, a lot of the low buck places sell really crappy
gas, I found to my dismay.
      Got really a lot of water at one place, but another gave me a tank
of gas that had I don't know what in it. I got stranded -- car ran like
it had major water, but no sign of it in the float bowl. No dirt either.
I replaced the filter, finally even replace the fuel pump out of
desperation (I had another one anyway, so it didn't cost anything) but
that was no help. Finally drained the tank, went to Chevron station, and
it ran fine after that.
     People I worked with who were into cars told me the same thing --
don't buy cheap gas. OTOH, like I said, I'd never had a problem like
that in MN or WI.
