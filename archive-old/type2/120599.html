Subject: Re: [T2] beam interchangability

&gt; Will a beam from a 68-70 fit on a 78? Now I'm
&gt; talking just the beam, I'd be using
&gt; springs/arms/brakes/whatnot from the 78 beam.
&gt; I'm getting the remains of a 68-70 Westy next week

The beams from modelyear 1968 and 1969 are different
than the beams used from 1970 until 1979. The
diference is in the distance between the bolts by
which you mount the beam agains the chassis. The
distance between the two nearest bolts is 9cm on the
old beams and 12cm on the '70-'79 beams.

Also the early beam might not have the brake servo
mountings.

By the way: the modelyear can be read from the 3rd
digit in the VIN. (for example: 9 = 1969 or 1979)
