Subject: Heloise does 'tires'

Man, I ain't gonna let this thread die without my 'valued' input.

New Cooper product, the SRM II Radial LT tire.

Made in USA, reasonably priced.

Highway rib thread pattern, but looks somewhat like M+S.

It IS an all season radial, and it DOES have the M+S rating on the
sidewall!

It is an ACTUAL 8 ply tire, plus 8 ply rating, of course.

Brad, at Alban Tires (703) 455 9300 Springfield Virginia says they are
$63 + taxes out the door, and $79 with mount, balance, valve stems,
disposal fees + taxes. (His price is the lowest around.)

And I figure $63 * 1.045 * 4 = $ 263.34

Now, read this list of stats!!!!
