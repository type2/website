Subject: Fwd: free bus in kentucky

&gt;From Unca joel... contact the seller directly as I don't know anything else about this bus.

-David

&gt;you might want to pass this along on the type2 list ... it's in
&gt;Erlanger, KY ...
&gt;listed in www.thesamba_dot_com ... appears to be a 1974 or later bus
&gt;(high front turn signals, and no gas filler door/flap) ... no
&gt;engine or transmission.
&gt;
&gt;here's the gist of the ad ...
&gt;
&gt;      free vw bus - save this bus!!!! - $0.00
&gt;      this bus has a lot of potential. it does not deserve to be
&gt;taken to a scrap yard. I hope that a volkswagen lover will come
&gt;and take her away to a nice new life of restoration. I was going
&gt;to restore this bus, but have since decided what I really want is
&gt;a pre - 68 bus.
&gt;
&gt;      I have a good title for this bus and will give it to any
&gt;true volkswagen enthusiast. the reason that I am offering it for
&gt;free is because it is parked on my dad's business property and it
&gt;is not allowed to stay. this bus does not have an engine or
&gt;transmission.
&gt;
&gt;      send me an email or call me if you want it.
&gt;
&gt;      thanks,
&gt;
