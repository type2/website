	HI,

	Got some responses from last Friday on the subject &quot;warming drinks&quot;. Those
that help you regain body temp when the night gets cold and the aux heater
have failed. 
Here they are:
------------------------------------------------------
	Here's how to make a &quot;halvkopp&quot;:
You need the following:
-A large coffee mug, 
-HOT, strong coffee, 
-a coin(of little value, it might be lost into your digestive system)
-Finnish vodka

-Now, put the coin on the bottom of the coffee mug, pour coffee into the
mug untill you can't see the coin, then pour vodka till you can see the
coin again. TAKE AWAY THE COIN! Enjoy while hot!

Irish coffee:
3 cubes of sugar
coffee hot!!
jigger of irish wisky
optional wipped cream

In a coffee mug, combine:
1.25 oz. brandy or whiskey (I prefer whiskey)
2-3 tablespoons of honey
squeeze a fresh lemon slice and leave the rind in
top off with *hot* water

Irish Coffee
In a coffee cup:
1.25 oz. Irish whiskey
top off with coffee
whipped cream

Peppermint Patty
In a coffee cup:
1.25 oz. Peppermint schnapps
top off with hot cocoa
whipped cream


I once made a batch of Long-Island Iced Tea in my
Westy's water tank, too.... pour in a bottle of each:
vodka, clear rum, gin, tequila, triple-sec and sweet
and sour mix. Then pump it out of the faucet over ice
and add a few onces of Coca-Cola and a slice of lemon
or lime....it's not a warm drink, but after drinking a
few, you'll forget all about the cold!!!! Oh yeah,
don't leave the mix in the water tank for too
long....it will literally soften the plastic!

Ulf,
  Try about 2 oz (more or less to taste) of Peppermint Schnapps in a mug of
hot cocoa.  Great cold weather drink.

I go skiing!

oh after I'm done, usually a hot soak and a mix of hot coffee and hot
chocolate.  depending on the caffine needed as to the mix.

when camping, crawl into my sleeping bag with a woman, (my wife!!!!)

easiest choices:  Mexican hot chocolate (made from &quot;Abuela&quot; brand
mexican chocolate tablets) with rum added or Tom and Jerry's from a mix.

Not easiest but MUCH better:  Irish coffee, using fresh brewed coffee
with Irish whisky and whipped cream from a can.

Definitely harder but BEST:  Irish coffee made with good espresso (gotta
have a machine. . .), Bushmills Irish Whisky and softly whipped fresh
heavy cream.  Good decaf espresso recommended or you will be wide awake
LONG after the whisky wears off (been there, done that)!

 As far as keepin warm, here in south central USA,
Texas to be excact, we us mostly Whiskey:) Not fancy,
or high class, but it works. Now bear in mind, it
doesnt raise your body temp, but the way it makes you
feel, you  would swear it was:)
 So hear, for me, its &quot;Wild Turkey 101&quot; good shit, but
dont take it to far..... your libile to fall out of
the tree when your out deer hunting:o
Later,

Jack Stafford (73 Westy) brought along some &quot;champagne mead&quot; on one
mountain trip, it wasn't *that* cold out, but the drink was fantastic!!!
Excellent taste, plus the altitude send the alcohol right to your
head... bring LOTS of firewood!!!

Being of Scottish heritage (I'm reaching here), I like coffee with
half and half and a good shot of Drambuie.  Very sweet, very warming
eventually sedative. . .

Miner's coffee

2 parts Kalua (sp?)
one part dark brandy
one part dark rum

Learned it on a camping trip in the smokey mountains on a back packing trip 
in below 0 F conditions. Yes it was dangerous.

Sterno.  You can either drink it or burn it.

Comment: A man in shabby clothes sitting in the park leaning his tired body
against a tree told me you can drink it if you filter it trough some white
bread. Have not tried this yet, doubt I'll ever try............

Perhaps in the winter, but for hot summer days I prefer to sit under
the awning with:

Summer Slush:

Use one 6 oz. can of frozen lemonade mix, empty into blender.  
Fill empty can with gin, empty into blender.  
Fill blender with ice and blend until smooth.

Pour into large plastic cups emblazoned with your favorite collegiate
emblem.  (Westy tumblers are an acceptable substitute, but awfully
small)

Serves 2.

Administrivial aside:  This thread is pretty close to the limit. 
Please don't continue it after Friday's gone!

Agree to that, don't comment this survey any further. If you have to,
P-mail me istead.

A special thank you to Jan Willem Brier for voting my &quot;halvkopp&quot; drink for
official camping drink!

Here's a bonus one:

Finnish Lingonberry drink:

- One full glass of Finnish vodka.
- One lingonberry.
- Dip the lingonberry into the vodka for at maximum 5 seconds, othervise
the berrytaste takes over:-)

If freezing in a VW bus makes a man out of me,
-- What a MAN I am!
