Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Depot prices to HIGH ! I Found parts way cheaper

Rob, 
 After further investigation, I think you are smoking crack...they don't
carry the same name brand items and the prices on the other brands look
higher to me. For example, the electronic ignition is over $100 at J-bugs
for a Comp-u-fire brand while the Pertronix at Bus Depot is around $70 plus
type2 list members get a discount on top of that.

I think it pays to shop around.


not to knock anyone or ones company but competition is
the name of the game. as a very small business owner
myself I understand prices sell..and so does
Word-To-Mouth..
