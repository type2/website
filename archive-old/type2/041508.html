Subject: Auto Empire - Seattle

Hey guys and gals.
Would anybody happend to have or know of dealer license plate frames
from Auto Empire in Seattle Washington?  I'd like one for my 62 as thats
where it was originally purchased from on April 10, 1962.

I know this is a long shot too.... but maybe, just maybe someone in the
Seattle area might know of him.  Robert E. Rosinkranz was the original
owner of my 62.... does anyone know of him?  Maybe he's still around?
maybe he's into Volkswagens?  *maybe*?

Thanks a bunch
