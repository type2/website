If you agreed to changing those parts you don't have a case. Shops always
want to replace parts before the end of the service interval and they love
it if there have no service history on your car.

&gt; I don't know what to do, or where to go
&gt; anymore.  I can not spend any more on this thing.  Should I try fighting the
&gt; repair shop in court?  Or just chalk it up as another loss?  And does anyone
&gt; know a strictly air cooled mechanic in the Brattleboro Vermont area who
&gt; knows what they are doing with busses?  After doing alot of research on this
&gt; problem on line, it looks like my tank may be clogged.

I'm not a carb expert by any means but doesn't the condition you describe
suggest an intake valve problem or a lean condition? Sounds like they
compensated for the problem and set the mixture right at idle but on the
road it leans out. Maybe there is a simple vacuum leak which survived all
the part replacement and adjustment?
