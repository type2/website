That's what happens when they go.

&gt;I have checked out the usual suspects and I can't really see any
&gt;indication of which ones are which.  Most say best quality viton.
&gt;Does it really matter which ones I use?

Any color Viton is fine. Just done use the original black/orange seals.

&gt;Right now I am losing about a quart of oil every 2-400 miles.  So
&gt;while not an amount I can't keep ahead of, its more than I am
&gt;comfortable with since an oil covered engine tends to collect dirt
&gt;which affects cooling efficiency.

That seems a lot for push rod tubes but the valve covers do see a lot of oil while the engine is running.
