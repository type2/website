Subject: Re: [T2] Cruisin CB channels for monitoring

&gt; I am going to match my AM Antenna whip to CB using a tuner that allows the
&gt; continued use of the AM/FM radio as well. 35 smackers for the cheap little
&gt; box.

alan

is there a box to use the cb whip for the radio as well?
Ive got the CB in a box and the firestick sitting in the corner and Id
rather not have 2 antennas whenever I get around to putting it in.....
