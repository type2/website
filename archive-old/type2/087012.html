&gt; Hi from the uk, I have been given a Vanagon as most of you listees know them 
&gt; a UK spec 2 litre electronic ignition, hydraulic lifters etc, etc.
&gt;  Do I (a) put the engine in my 76 bay 1.8 litre 914 engined auto.  
&gt;         (b) put the engine and gearbox in my 76 bay
&gt;         (c) just put the electronic ignition on my bay
&gt;         (d) just take the engine out and save it for a rainy day  
&gt; your opinions please.
&gt; the 1.8 runs well 85hp. the 2 litre has bad oil leaks I am told from the push 
&gt; rod tubes and the heat exchangers need replacement and a slipping clutch. 

I would put it in the 76 auto tranny bus, could use the extra horses
then put the 914 engine in (b) and save that engine for a rainy
day.  fixing push rod tubes to stop leaks is not hard and can be done with
engine in.

my 2 cents and worth every cent I'm sure
