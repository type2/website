Subject: Re: [T2] Greatful Dawg

Not much in the way of buses in the grateful dawg movie. In fact I don't
remember seeing any. I was more focused on the music and the men though. It
relates to Jerry and David's collaborations more than GD projects and the
whole hippie buses on tour thing. Lots of folk/blue grass(they did touch on
other things they did together as well). I highly recommend it in spite of
the absence of busage.

&gt; unlike most other movies on Starz, they do NOT (usually) repeat ther
&gt; cinemateque movies, so if you want to see this, watch it monday or ask
&gt; someone to record it for you. if anyone wants ME to, just let me know
&gt; this weekend so i can get a tape ready for it.
&gt;
&gt; (talk about bus sightings! i bet there are a MILLION of em in there!)
