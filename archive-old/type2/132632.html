Subject: Re: [T2] Insurance in California for 72 westy ?

I have a 1976 Westy registered in San Francisco.

&gt; I want only liability insurance only.  I expect the cost to be low

Vehicle value doesn't have much of an impact if you are insuring for 
liability only.  With liability only, they never have to worry about 
replacing anything on or repairing the vehicle.

&gt; So far I've received the following quotes:
&gt;
&gt; (all for 6 months of coverage)
&gt;
&gt; Geico $511

Hm.  Mine is insured with Geico, but I don't recall exactly how much 
I'm paying.  I can call them and double-check (or try and remember 
where our &quot;insurance stuff&quot; folder is :-), but it may be skewed since 
my wife has been Geico a customer for quite a while and we insure 2 
cars with them, and they sometimes give you a break on the price in 
that situation.  $85/mo does seem a little high.

&gt; Progressive $507
&gt; Allstate $360
&gt; State Farm $305

Previous to getting on Geico, and when I lived in Campbell, CA, I had 
State Farm for a non-VW pickup I had... I don't recall what I paid for 
that, either, but I had broader coverage than liability only.  I did 
have one claim against that policy (driver's window smashed and stereo 
taken while parked in San Francisco overnight), and they handled it 
very smoothly and did not increase my rates after the claim, so I can 
say I had a positive experience with State Farm.

With liability only, if you're a very careful driver, you're not likely 
to ever make a claim against your policy, so perhaps State Farm is the 
best choice for you.

One question, though... are those rates all for the same amount of 
liability coverage?

Another way to save on insurance is to carry multiple policies with the 
same company.  For example, if you have a renter's or homeowner's 
policy with a given company, that company may give you a discounted 
rate on your car insurance.
