Subject: Buying a Replacement Jack
Content-Disposition: inline

&gt;So ive heard everything from needing a 20inch one to a 24 inch one. I havent
&gt;seen even one over 21&quot; so far so IM guessing 19-20 should be fine?
&gt;ive been doing some shopping around and ive heard of people carrying this
&gt;SUV specific set that includes the jackstands as well, but havent been able
&gt;to find one yet.

Not too sure about lift height, but my first jack was a sears floor jack (2.25
tons)
which worked great and cost me about $90 10 years ago. Don't leave it in your
bus
no matter how late the job finishes, as mine was promptly stolen. I went to a
flaps
after that and bought a 2.5 ton jack called &quot;big red&quot; for like $79. I've had
that for
the last 7 years and it's seen mondo use with no problems. Okay well it's
getting a
bit tired now.

Works fine for most bus applications. On B*g engine pulls I use ramps in
conjunction
with a thick piece of wood between the jack cup and oil sump, and that makes up
for
the limitations on jack height. go for it.
