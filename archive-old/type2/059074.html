Subject: Re: key code is where on cylinder?

I realize I never mentioned the year of the bus in this post, it is a 75.  I
deserve a flogging for sure.

And for the record/archive, the key code was not stamped here.  I read about
it in the archives and it was the first place I looked (since it was so
easy).  But that is only one handle out of how many 75 buses:)  YMMV as they
say.

The lock cylinder on the sliding door finally revealed the key code (as the
front door cylinders had been wiped clean, only the last two numbers
showed).  

*ALL* three VW dealers in the area told me &quot;good luck finding someone who
can decipher the key code, we don't even have the key blanks for that kind
of car&quot;.

It took a parking lot locksmith five minutes to lookup the code and make me
a key.

-&gt;&gt;Where on the lock cylinder is the key code stamped???
-&gt;&gt;
-&gt;On the sliding door ,the easiest to get to, unscrew the inner handle and
-&gt;pull the outer handle straight out there should be some numbers and letters
-&gt;stamped on there.
-&gt;
-&gt;BTW this is for a 73 or earlier with lock cylinder in the handle.  I have
-&gt;never tried this on a 74 or after.
