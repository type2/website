OK, as long as we're voting on favorite tools, how about this one:  what is
the most successful (your definition, not mine) installation of a non-VW
motor into a bus you've seen?  Why?  And steady now - these machines are for
fun.  Obviously, I don't consider &quot;successful engine swap&quot; to be an
oxymoron.
