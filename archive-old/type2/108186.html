Subject: heater box header woes

So I lost both exhaust studs on cylinder number 3 sometime ago. A week or so
ago I replaced one, but didn't have the correct size on the other one. I went
ahead and put everything back together with one stud missing as I was going on
a short trip and didn't have time to futz with it anymore. Lucy ran a little
hot, and from time to time I could hear some blowby.

Anyway last night I got the correct stud size, pulled everything apart, put
the stud in, then got stuck. I can't get the heater box header onto the studs
now - it's almost like either one stud hole was drilled in the wrong place by
about 1/16 of an inch, or one or two studs are not perfectly square. I notice
that if I take the heater box header (and I took it off the heater box to make
it easier to manipulate under the bus with a foot of clearance) - hold it with
the triangular flange at the top (oh yeah Lucy's a '75 camper), and look down
into the flange for cylinder three if I could take that flange and twist it
counterclockwise through an arc of about 1/16 an inch it the holes on the
flange should then line up right.

So my question: short of pounding the header onto the studs - which will be a
huge pain and could ruin the stud threads and maybe even crack the aluminum -
what can be done? I'd like to avoid retapping the heads too. I figure I could
maybe drill the flange holes just a hair wider, or somehow twist that one
flange - course old metal doesn't like to twist so well I know and I'm a bit
concerned about cracking things.

Any advice would be appreciated. Sorry for writing a book - I seem to always
do that.
