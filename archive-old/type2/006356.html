Subject: Re: [T2] Anti-Seize

Tommy-
If you are following the thread, you are now lost as well.
My response to the question of proper torque pressure
of a lubricated bolt was a question regarding whether that
was an accurate spec in light of the fact that a lubricant
allows the fastener to tighten easier, whereas a torque spec
is generally posted for a dry fastener. This was not a  suggestion
to only torque dry thread fasteners, but rather a &quot; twist&quot; ( pun )
on the subject insofar as i prefer to use locktite on critical
fasteners ( connecting rods and cylinder heads ) and no specs are
available for lubricated fasteners. The &quot;run-on &quot; torque adjusted
spec for fasteners which resist  turning can be generally reduced
by cleaning those fasteners, and the previous post pointing at
how engineers come up with these specs indicates that the torsional
stresses of various sizes and hardness and material of bolts is already
factored into the spec, and there is also some indication of the effect
of a lubricant, but it remains unclear if the torque spec is factored for
a lubricant. i believe it is not, it is for a dry fastener. I recommend
locktite and anti-sieze, and believe the torque spec is not accurate
for lubricants.see below.

&gt;Sorry to disagree Dave, but any bolt worth torquing should be lubed with at
&gt;least some light lubricant! IE rod bolts, main cap bolts, head bolts, etc.
&gt;The lubricant makes the threads turn smoothly and give a proper reading.

&gt;&gt; &gt;And when all threads are
&gt;&gt; &gt;lubed w/ anti-seize, I have a better chance of getting meaningful torque
&gt;&gt; &gt;readings.  I just put a brand new set of factory 16&quot; alloys on my T100
&gt;&gt; &gt;truck, and I sure wanted these megabuck wheels to be properly torqued.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Possibly not. Torque specs are generally intended for dry threads, and
&gt;&gt; slippery lubricants are fairly difficult ( i.e. impossible ) to spec for
&gt;that.
&gt;&gt; Chances are you have more pressure than you would like on those wheels.
