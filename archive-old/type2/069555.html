Subject: Re: :) Turning air cooled into water cooled

&gt;The New York Museum of Natural History is going to take a
&gt;VW bug and drop it into the murky waters of Lake Erie. They are
&gt;doing a project on Zebra Mussels (sp?), and will take the
&gt;zebra-coated bug out in November, shellac it, and put it on display
&gt;in an endangered species exhibit.
&gt;
&gt;Of course, the irony of the air cooled engine was lost..

Zebra mussels an endanged species? I don't think so. They are an
invader from Europe, brought in from contaminated ballast water
dumped by freighters into the Great Lakes. It has caused some major
troubles in the Lakes, and the jury is still out on just how much
environmental damage this invader is going to cause.
