Subject: New Stuff---

Hey All,
I have done it again--
This time I have come up with a really neat item--for those of you into
camping--or just hanging out at a campground--

I had a custom made Sunbrella color matched 7x 10 awning made for my 87
Westy--and it sure looks neat hanging off the side of my Van--perfect
color match.

And I can have almost any single color in the rainbow custom made for
your Bus / Van, and in several states of completion.

You could just purchase the Sunbrella canvas--in almost any size you
could think of--with or without marine grade extendable poles--( 5 ft.
to 10 ft extension) storage bag for the stakes, lines, and canvas, with
or without the mounting hardware-- side curtains, screened or not
screened--zippered entryway--the possibilities are endless.

Anyway the one downfall--this is not an inexpensive item--and not for
the monetary fainthearted--
It is not a Taiwanese light duty nylon blow away unit--it's a heavy
duty, quality craftsmanship awning--which will last you for many camping
trips--and many years to come.

Check the unit out at my &quot;Van Stuff&quot; web page below-- I just picked it
up and mounted to the side of my 87 Westy--in my driveway--just for
picture purposes--there is a description with the pictures--

Happy Trails,

            ______________
