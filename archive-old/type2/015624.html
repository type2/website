Subject: 2.0l Distributor part #

Hi Volks,

I wish to change the dizzy on my '76 Double Cab back to the correct
original one.It has been running a 009 for some time (bought in an
emergency to get me going and kinda stayed there...)
Needless to say the 009 must go but I need the part no for the 
original spec distributor.
I have several old dizzys lying around in my garage that all look
like the real thing but the last three digits vary so obviously
some come from other VW applications.I can't tell now which was the
one that came out of the truck (duh!)

Engine specs are 2.0l Type 4 with twin solexes (all original)

I'm about to help a friend dismantle a heap of old VWs past their
use-by date and would like to be able to know for sure when I
come across the right distrubutor amongst all the false prophets
attempting to lead me astray ;)

So if any kind soul has that info at their fingertips I would
indeed be most grateful...

Thanks,
Steve O
