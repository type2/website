Subject: Re: Fwd: Re: [T2] Well, another 'runs 3 seconds' bus

Position it to where you can see it in the rear-view
mirror. If it's a trigger-type, put a rubber band on
the trigger. Put it on the coil wire instead of
sparkplug wire to see if there is spark from the coil
as the engine is dieing. If you put it on a spark plug
wire, then a fault within the distributor could be the
problem, so leave it on the coil wire. When it dies,
if it was still flashing as the engine cut out, then
try it on a spark plug wire (it is unlikely anything
intermittent would occur there anyway, so it doesn't
matter a whole lot!) If the light stops flashing as
the engine dies, you know there is an ignition problem
and you need to solve that before spending a lot of
time on fuel or timing issues. If the light keeps
flashing, you can spend your efforts on diagnosing a
fuel problem (or on FI, an air / vacuum problem which
is also considered a fuel problem.) Do I make sense?

&gt; Please explain 
&gt; this a bit. What do you mean to hook it up to the
&gt; coil wire? What can 
&gt; we learn from such a set up?
