Subject: RE: [T2]  Waterbed (was Now I've Heard It All!)

Hello list,

The only way that I could see a water bed being
feasible is if it were no more than 6&quot; tall. If I were
to do somthing like this, I would use the regular Z
bed and have the water bladder deflated and rolled up
until you planned on using it. When you got to the
camp sight, you would have to roll out the water
bladder over the open Z bed and fill it with a water
hose. I sure as heck would not drive it for any
distance with it fully inflated. Even then, It would
be safer to have a lined frame around it.

That is what I think of it.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Burst a water bed inside a bus and two things
&gt; would probably happen...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The engine would probably flood and die causing
&gt; very rapid 
&gt; &gt; deceleration coupled with a decided list in the
&gt; direction the water 
&gt; &gt; decided to take... Altogether, as Laurie Anderson
&gt; once said, &quot;I'd 
&gt; &gt; rather see this on TV...&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; No. I think youd have about 2 feet of water in the
&gt; cargo area or in a
&gt; walkthrough about 18 inches in the cargo and cab
&gt; area. And it would be
&gt; leaking out as fast as it could find a path.
