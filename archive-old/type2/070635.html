JWB, posted  a link to a pic of the a Dutch produced mouse pad with lotsa cool logo'd buses on it. What would it take to get some of those imported? Could we do a group purchase to save on shipping?

Any dutch listmembers interested in lending a hand?

For  those of you who missed the first post here is the link:
