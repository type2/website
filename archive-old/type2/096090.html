&gt; I am going to have my Bus pulling a float (farm wagon that can be

&gt; keeping my engine cool.  Of course it will be hot that day and I will
&gt; be going at idle speed.

I drove mine in a parade once and wasn't towing anything, it is as you
suspect quite hard on the engine cooling.

&gt;  There will be a generator to operate
&gt; something else so was thinking about having a fan blow through the
&gt; hatch on top.  My Bus is a 74.  I do have a oil temp guage and an
&gt; external oil cooler.  It would to very hard to have a fan blowing on
&gt; the cooler.  

something or someone to spray water into the air intakes on a regular
basis, make sure your cooling system is PERFECT and don't even think about
doing it without guages, and watch em.  when possible slip it into neutral
and let the engine rev up a little

good luck, and don't let all the pretty girls distract you
