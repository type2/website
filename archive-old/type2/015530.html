&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt;I'm just wanting to annouce that my 1972 westy is getting the 1700cc
carbed engine replaced with a 2Ltr with stock fuel injection.  It's at the
Tech Shop in Seattle.  I got the engine through the Bus Depot.  The FI is
from a bone yard.  
&gt;
&gt;I'm excited but thought I'd also ask if there is anything I should know.
The single carb set-up I had in for 6 mo. is gone so no more painfully long
engine warm-ups.  But is there a break in time, ajust the FI in how many
miles...etc.  Thought I'd ask.


Expect the warrenty papers that come with the motor will specify their
breaking in procedures required to effect a valid warrenty. Know that my VW
engine rebuilder will not warrenty any of their motors if Castrol oil is
used for breakin. They have had several engines lose their cam lobes in
short milage and the common factor in 7 of 8 failures was Castrol oil used
for initial fill. That's with NEW German cams and lifters, not regrinds.
One of his clients went through three short life engines till they figured
out the cause. This has only been with both air and water cooled VW boxer
engines.

Also, initial fill and breakin is best with strait 30 weight. After 500 to
1000 miles, multi-grade is just fine in temperate climates. Never use
synthetics for breakin of these early motors. Some of them are too slick
and things just won't lap in right. 

This is the breaking in procedure I would use on MY T-IV motor. Set initial
timing static perhaps a few degrees retarded from spec. Certainly don't
want more than stock advance for initial startup. Fully charge the battery.
Hook up a booster charger for the initial procedure. Ground the coil wire,
block the chokes open on carbs and wedge the throttle/s full open on either
carbs or FI. Pull the fittings off the double relay on the FI models. No
need to wash the new cylinders with gas for the pre-start procedure. Pull
the plugs for better spinning of the motor with less strain for the starter
and quicker results.

Don't touch the trottle, you blocked that open, remember? Lay on the
starter for a count to 5. Rest for 10 seconds or so. If you lay on the
starter for longer intervals, you can burn up the ignition switch or
overheat the starter. Repeat, perhaps a dozen times till you see the oil
pressure light go off. Don't fire up and rev the motor till oil pressure is
established.  

Hook up the ignition and FI or carbs to prepare to start. With carbs, give
it a shot of ether, then fire it up. If may die if the fuel bowls aren't
yet full, but another shot or two and it should idle on it's own. Run back,
set the idle back to stock, verify and adjust timing to spec or a coupla
degrees retarded from stock setting. That new motor will generate a lot of
heat from naturally high friction associated with new parts not yet lapped
in. Initial settings of carbs and FI should also be just a bit rich to help
keep temps in order. 

Now run the motor for 20 minutes. 50 seconds at 2500, 10 seconds at idle,
over and over. You are lapping in the cam lobes with lots of oil splash.
Once that's done, shut it down and let it cool for an hour. Then fire it up
and let it warm up enough to verify timing and do the final mixture
adjustment, again, a hair rich and a hair retarded. 

Now drive it to a fairly steep hill, 5% grade or better. Cruise up the hill
in second gear under low rpm and light load, then give it about half
throttle to bring up the load on the motor. Keep rpms relatively low,
certainly less than 4000 rpm. This will truly seat the rings. Do this a
half dozen times. Then drive it back home, drain the hot oil, and replace
it with new 30 weight. I use DELO for breaking in. Now check to see if you
just don't need to adjust the mixture. The motor is already more efficient
than it was upon startup. 

Drive it some 500 miles, then change oil and filter and adjust the valves
on solid lifter engines. Drive it 2 months, 2000 miles, then change again
and now go to the proper multi-grade for you clime. Then maintenance by
inspection for life with all adjustments maintained spec. For the first
thousand miles or so, keep the rpms well back from redline and shift a lot
of gears. What you don't want to do is cruise in one gear at a constant rpm
for miles on end. You want a variety of piston speeds during the initial
breakin miles. Shifting up and down along twisty side roads with a bit of
stop and go is ideal. Keep the loads moderate. Know the loads on a fully
packed Westy are a lot higher than with empty Kombi.

DO NOT drive 2 miles to work and back daily for the initial 1000 miles.
Take the long way and everytime you start the motor, get it fully warm and
keep it warm for at least another 10 minutes. Monitor the oil every few
hundred miles. If you smell gas in the oil from too much short range
driving, change it now. Monitor the initial oil dumps for extremely fine
metallic hair. That's from the high points from the cross hatch on the
cylinders. A small quantity is natural and of no concern in the first dump
or two. Thereafter there should be none.

This is rule of thumb. Follow the instruction of your motor builder and
mechanic if you want to rely on them for your warrenty. My motor builder
even covers my labor to replace any failure when warrenty instructions are
followed and documented because in these cases you don't ever need the
warrenty.
