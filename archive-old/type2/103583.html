&gt; I have recently adopted a '74 Bay Window from a well intentioned,

Hate to break the news, but there really is no way to tell with out
doing some serious engine surgery. You can make some guesses and might
be correct, but can't tell for sure.

&gt; I am new to busses, and would appreciate help in recognising what
&gt; distinguishing marks to look for. Most of the engine labelling in
&gt; missing, but I can see what appears to be &quot;AW-A&quot;. Can any of you old
&gt; hands translate that for me? To add to the confusion, do people ever
&gt; bore-out the 1800s to 2000?

looks like the AW case is consistant w/ an 1800 stock [0], but an PO
could have made that case into a 2.0L w/out much problems, so this is
far from a sure thing. But if it runs well, I wouldn't worry much
about it, just enjoy it.
