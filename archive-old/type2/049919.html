&gt; 
&gt; As an FYI, I wanted to let you know that I went to
&gt; order Phish's Almanac for 
&gt; a friend the other day and on the cover of it is a
&gt; picture of Kristin 
&gt; Laurite, the murdered girl in Arkansas.  I guess she
&gt; was a really big Phish 
&gt; phan and so they are donating some money from every
&gt; book sold to her memorial 
&gt; fund to find the killer.  You probably already knew
&gt; this, but I thought I'd 
&gt; pass it along anyway.  We should spread the word to
&gt; buy the almanac and help 
&gt; fund the memorial.
&gt; 
&gt; Happy Holidays!!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Belinda
