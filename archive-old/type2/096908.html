Subject: Re: [T2] sticky steering wheel - Why??

I guess this is kind of a Friday question:  Why does the steering 
wheel get sticky??  This has happened to mine, too (coincidentally a 
78).  It was fine for 17 years, always had the same texture, then my 
father parked it for ~2 years.  I've had it for 5 years now &amp; it's 
never been the same, no matter how I clean.
