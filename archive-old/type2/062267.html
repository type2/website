Subject: Re: Push rod tubes 

Hi Volks,

Last time I rebuilt my 2.0 L '78 Westy engine, I had a bad time putting
the pushrod tubes back in without pinching (and thus nicking, and thus - 
presumably- setting up for a leak) the outer O-rings. I did not use new
tubes, but I did meticulous bend and tweak each o-ring channel on each tube
with lots of patience and love and needlenose pliers until they looked
pretty immaculate (i.e., virtually spotless, almost undetectable, etc.).
I'd dip 'em in oil, even oil the hole where they go, push 'em in carefully, 
make that last little push c-a-r-e-f-u-l-l-y- and s-l-o-w-l-y and 
g-e-n-t-l-y with a dowel of the right diameter, and 50% of the time,
the damn thing would pinch a 1/16&quot; to 1/8&quot; edge of an o-ring somewhere.
So I'd pull it out, put on a new ring, and try again. 

I had an extra set of O-rings, and it took all of 'em to get one set of
8 in without pinching. They were all brand new. 

So what is the killer brand of high test, idiot resistant o-rings, and
where can I buy them? Would new tubes really make the difference? I had one
and it looked just like the used ones in every respect I could see or feel.

Respectfully,
Surfer Bob
