 if you have any pics of the underside alt. i would really appreciate it.
thanks.  i have looked at all the shots made avaliable through the
list and at ratwell's page and i'm just not seeing the tin.  i wrote
on this piece that it was an alt.  piece, so it must go around it
somewhere.  the  bently is no help.  the pics are beyond vague to my untrained eye.  it's been 8 months since
i pulled the tin and i just cannot remember where it goes.

If you can take a picture of it and either pmail me or put it up on flickr_dot_com  I can tell you exactly where
it goes.
